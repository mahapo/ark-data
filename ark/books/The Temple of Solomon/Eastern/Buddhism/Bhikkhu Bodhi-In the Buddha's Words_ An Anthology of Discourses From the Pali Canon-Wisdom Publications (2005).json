He offered advice to all who wished to heedit, inviting them to listen, reflect, and critically examine what he had to say.He addressed different individuals and groups of people over a period of morethan forty years.After the Buddha’s passing, a record of what he said was maintained as an oraltradition. Those who heard the teachings would periodically meet with others forcommunal recitations of what they had heard and memorized. In due course, theserecitations from memory were written down, laying the basis for all subsequentBuddhist literature. The Pāli Canon is one of the earliest of these writtenrecords and the only complete early version that has survived intact. Within thePāli Canon, the texts known as the Nikāyas have the special value of being asingle cohesive collection of the Buddha’s teachings in his own words. Theseteachings cover a wide range of topics; they deal not only with renunciation andliberation, but also with the proper relations between husbands and wives, themanagement of the household, and the way countries should be governed. Theyexplain the path of spiritual development—from generosity and ethics, throughmind training and the realization of wisdom, all the way up to the attainment ofliberation.The teachings from the Nikāyas collected here provide fascinating insights intohow the Buddha’s teachings were studied, preserved, and understood in the earlydays of Buddhism’s development. Modern readers will find them especiallyvaluable for reinvigorating and clarifying their understanding of manyfundamental Buddhist doctrines. Clearly the Buddha’s essential message ofcompassion, ethical responsibility, mental tranquillity, and discernment is asrelevant today as it was more than twenty-five hundred years ago.Although Buddhism spread and took root in many parts of Asia, evolving intodiverse traditions according to the place and occasion, distance and differencesof language limited exchange between Buddhists in the past. One of the resultsof modern improvements in transport and communication that I most appreciate isthe vastly expanded opportunities those interested in Buddhism now have toacquaint themselves with the full range of Buddhist teaching and practice. WhatI find especially encouraging about this book is that it shows so clearly howmuch fundamentally all schools of Buddhism have in common. I congratulateBhikkhu Bodhi for this careful work of compilation and translation. I offer myprayers that readers may find advice here—and the inspiration to put it intopractice—that will enable them to develop inner peace, which I believe isessential for the creation of a happier and more peaceful world.005 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_005_r1.gif]Venerable Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama May 10, 2005"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEThe Buddha’s discourses preserved in the Pāli Canon are called suttas, thePāli equivalent of the Sanskrit word sūtras. Although the Pāli Canon belongsto a particular Buddhist school—the Theravāda, or School of the Elders—thesuttas are by no means exclusively Theravāda Buddhist texts. They stem from theearliest period of Buddhist literary history, a period lasting roughly a hundredyears after the Buddha’s death, before the original Buddhist community dividedinto different schools. The Pāli suttas have counterparts from other earlyBuddhist schools now extinct, texts sometimes strikingly similar to the Pāliversion, differing mainly in settings and arrangements but not in points ofdoctrine. The suttas, along with their counterparts, thus constitute the mostancient records of the Buddha’s teachings available to us; they are the closestwe can come to what the historical Buddha Gotama himself actually taught. Theteachings found in them have served as the fountainhead, the primal source, forall the evolving streams of Buddhist doctrine and practice through thecenturies. For this reason, they constitute the common heritage of the entireBuddhist tradition, and Buddhists of all schools who wish to understand thetaproot of Buddhism should make a close and careful study of them a priority.In the Pāli Canon the Buddha’s discourses are preserved in collections calledNikāyas. Over the past twenty years, fresh translations of the four majorNikāyas have appeared in print, issued in attractive and affordable editions.Wisdom Publications pioneered this development in 1987 when it published MauriceWalshe’s translation of the Dīgha Nikāya, The Long Discourses of the Buddha.Wisdom followed this precedent by bringing out, in 1995, my revised and editedversion of Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli’s handwritten translation of the Majjhima Nikāya,The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, followed in 2000 by my newtranslation of the complete Saṃyutta Nikāya, The Connected Discourses of theBuddha. In 1999, under the imprint of The Sacred Literature Trust Series,AltaMira Press published an anthology of suttas from the Aṅguttara Nikāya,translated by the late Nyanaponika Thera and myself, titled Numerical Discoursesof the Buddha. I am currently working on a new translation of the entireAṅguttara Nikāya, intended for Wisdom Publication’s Teachings of the Buddhaseries.Many who have read these larger works have told me, to my satisfaction, that thetranslations brought the suttas to life for them. Yet others who earnestlysought to enter the deep ocean of the Nikāyas told me something else. They saidthat while the language of the translations made them far more accessible thanearlier translations, they were still grappling for a standpoint from which tosee the suttas’ overall structure, a framework within which they all fittogether. The Nikāyas themselves do not offer much help in this respect, fortheir arrangement—with the notable exception of the Saṃyutta Nikāya, whichdoes have a thematic structure—appears almost haphazard.In an ongoing series of lectures I began giving at Bodhi Monastery in New Jerseyin January 2003, I devised a scheme of my own to organize the contents of theMajjhima Nikāya. This scheme unfolds the Buddha’s message progressively, fromthe simple to the difficult, from the elementary to the profound. Uponreflection, I saw that this scheme could be applied not only to the MajjhimaNikāya, but to the four Nikāyas as a whole. The present book organizes suttasselected from all four Nikāyas within this thematic and progressive framework.This book is intended for two types of readers. The first are those not yetacquainted with the Buddha’s discourses who feel the need for a systematicintroduction. For such readers, any of the Nikāyas is bound to appear opaque.All four of them, viewed at once, may seem like a jungle—entangling andbewildering, full of unknown beasts—or like the great ocean—vast, tumultuous,and forbidding. I hope that this book will serve as a map to help them wendtheir way through the jungle of the suttas or as a sturdy ship to carry themacross the ocean of the Dhamma.The second type of readers for whom this book is meant are those, alreadyacquainted with the suttas, who still cannot see how they fit together into anintelligible whole. For such readers, individual suttas may be comprehensible inthemselves, but the texts in their totality appear like pieces of a jigsawpuzzle scattered across a table. Once one understands the scheme in this book,one should come away with a clear idea of the architecture of the teaching.Then, with a little reflection, one should be able to determine the place anysutta occupies in the edifice of the Dhamma, whether or not it has been includedin this anthology.This anthology, or any other anthology of suttas, is no substitute for theNikāyas themselves. My hope is twofold, corresponding to the two types ofreaders for whom this volume is designed: (1) that newcomers to Early Buddhistliterature find this volume whets their appetite for more and encourages them totake the plunge into the full Nikāyas; and (2) that experienced readers of theNikāyas finish the book with a better understanding of material with which theyare already familiar.If this anthology is meant to make any other point, it is to convey the sheerbreadth and range of the Buddha’s wisdom. While Early Buddhism is sometimesdepicted as a discipline of world renunciation intended primarily for asceticsand contemplatives, the ancient discourses of the Pāli Canon clearly show ushow the Buddha’s wisdom and compassion reached into the very depths of mundanelife, providing ordinary people with guidelines for proper conduct and rightunderstanding. Far from being a creed for a monastic élite, ancient Buddhisminvolved the close collaboration of householders and monastics in the twin tasksof maintaining the Buddha’s teachings and assisting one another in their effortsto walk the path to the extinction of suffering. To fulfill these tasksmeaningfully, the Dhamma had to provide them with deep and inexhaustibleguidance, inspiration, joy, and consolation. It could never have done this if ithad not directly addressed their earnest efforts to combine social and familyobligations with an aspiration to realize the highest.Almost all the passages included in this book have been selected from theabove-mentioned publications of the four Nikāyas. Almost all have undergonerevisions, usually slight but sometimes major, to accord with my own evolvingunderstanding of the texts and the Pāli language. I have newly translated asmall number of suttas from the Aṅguttara Nikāya not included in theabove-mentioned anthology. I have also included a handful of suttas from theUdāna and Itivuttaka, two small books belonging to the fifth Nikāya, theKhuddaka Nikāya, the Minor or Miscellaneous Collection. I have based these onJohn D. Ireland’s translation, published by the Buddhist Publication Society inSri Lanka, but again I have freely modified them to fit my own preferred dictionand terminology. I have given preference to suttas in prose over those in verse,as being more direct and explicit. When a sutta concludes with verses, if thesemerely restate the preceding prose, in the interest of space I have omittedthem.Each chapter begins with an introduction in which I explain the salient conceptsrelevant to the theme of the chapter and try to show how the texts I have chosenexemplify that theme. To clarify points arising from both the introductions andthe texts, I have included end-notes. These often draw upon the classicalcommentaries to the Nikāyas ascribed to the great South Indian commentatorĀcariya Buddhaghosa, who worked in Sri Lanka in the fifth century C.E. For thesake of concision, I have not included as many notes in this book as I have inmy other translations of the Nikāyas. These notes are also not as technical asthose in the full translations.References to the sources follow each selection. References to texts from theDīgha Nikāya and Majjhima Nikāya cite the number and name of the sutta (inPāli); passages from these two collections retain the paragraph numbers used inThe Long Discourses of the Buddha and The Middle Length Discourses of theBuddha, so readers who wish to locate these passages within the fulltranslations can easily do so. References to texts from the Saṃyutta Nikāyacite saṃyutta and sutta number; texts from the Aṅguttara Nikāya cite nipātaand sutta number (the Ones and the Twos also cite chapters within the nipātafollowed by the sutta number). References to texts from the Udāna cite nipātaand sutta number; texts from the Itivuttaka cite simply the sutta number. Allreferences are followed by the volume and page number in the Pali Text Society’sstandard edition of these works.I am grateful to Timothy McNeill and David Kittelstrom of Wisdom Publicationsfor urging me to persist with this project in the face of long periods ofindifferent health. Sāmaṇera Anālayo and Bhikkhu Nyanasobhano read andcommented on my introductions, and John Kelly reviewed proofs of the entirebook. All three made useful suggestions, for which I am grateful. John Kellyalso prepared the table of sources that appears at the back of the book.Finally, I am grateful to my students of Pāli and Dhamma studies at BodhiMonastery for their enthusiastic interest in the teachings of the Nikāyas,which inspired me to compile this anthology. I am especially thankful to themonastery’s extraordinary founder, Ven. Master Jen-Chun, for welcoming a monk ofanother Buddhist tradition to his monastery and for his interest in bridging theNorthern and Southern transmissions of the Early Buddhist teachings.Bhikkhu Bodhi"},{"pageContent":"LIST OF ABBREVIATIONSANAṅguttara NikāyaBeBurmese-script Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana ed.CeSinhala-scripted.DNDīgha NikāyaEeRoman-script ed.

Sometimes he would enunciateinvariable principles that stand at the heart of the teaching. Sometimes hewould adapt the teaching to accord with the proclivities and aptitudes of thepeople who came to him for guidance. Sometimes he would adjust his exposition tofit a situation that required a particular response. But throughout thecollections of texts that have come down to us as authorized “Word of theBuddha,” we do not find a single sutta, a single discourse, in which the Buddhahas drawn together all the elements of his teaching and assigned them to theirappropriate place within some comprehensive system.While in a literate culture in which systematic thought is highly prized thelack of such a text with a unifying function might be viewed as a defect, in anentirely oral culture—as was the culture in which the Buddha lived and moved—thelack of a descriptive key to the Dhamma would hardly be considered significant.Within this culture neither teacher nor student aimed at conceptualcompleteness. The teacher did not intend to present a complete system of ideas;his pupils did not aspire to learn a complete system of ideas. The aim thatunited them in the process of learning—the process of transmission—was that ofpractical training, self-transformation, the realization of truth, andunshakable liberation of the mind. This does not mean, however, that theteaching was always expediently adapted to the situation at hand. At times theBuddha would present more panoramic views of the Dhamma that united manycomponents of the path in a graded or wide-ranging structure. But though thereare several discourses that exhibit a broad scope, they still do not embrace allelements of the Dhamma in one overarching scheme.The purpose of the present book is to develop and exemplify such a scheme. Ihere attempt to provide a comprehensive picture of the Buddha’s teaching thatincorporates a wide variety of suttas into an organic structure. This structure,I hope, will bring to light the intentional pattern underlying the Buddha’sformulation of the Dhamma and thus provide the reader with guidelines forunderstanding Early Buddhism as a whole. I have selected the suttas almostentirely from the four major collections or Nikāyas of the Pāli Canon, thoughI have also included a few texts from the Udāna and Itivuttaka, two small booksof the fifth collection, the Khuddaka Nikāya. Each chapter opens with its ownintroduction, in which I explain the basic concepts of Early Buddhism that thetexts exemplify and show how the texts give expression to these ideas.I will briefly supply background information about the Nikāyas later in thisintroduction. First, however, I want to outline the scheme that I have devisedto organize the suttas. Although my particular use of this scheme may beoriginal, it is not sheer innovation but is based upon a threefold distinctionthat the Pāli commentaries make among the types of benefits to which thepractice of the Dhamma leads: (1) welfare and happiness visible in this presentlife; (2) welfare and happiness pertaining to future lives; and (3) the ultimategood, Nibbāna (Skt: nirṿ̄a).Three preliminary chapters are designed to lead up to those that embody thisthreefold scheme. Chapter I is a survey of the human condition as it is apartfrom the appearance of a Buddha in the world. Perhaps this was the way humanlife appeared to the Bodhisatta—the future Buddha—as he dwelled in the Tusitaheaven gazing down upon the earth, awaiting the appropriate occasion to descendand take his final birth. We behold a world in which human beings are drivenhelplessly toward old age and death; in which they are spun around bycircumstances so that they are oppressed by bodily pain, cast down by failureand misfortune, made anxious and fearful by change and deterioration. It is aworld in which people aspire to live in harmony, but in which their untamedemotions repeatedly compel them, against their better judgment, to lock horns inconflicts that escalate into violence and wholesale devastation. Finally, takingthe broadest view of all, it is a world in which sentient beings are propelledforward, by their own ignorance and craving, from one life to the next,wandering blindly through the cycle of rebirths called saṃsāra.Chapter II gives an account of the Buddha’s descent into this world. He comes asthe “one person” who appears out of compassion for the world, whose arising inthe world is “the manifestation of great light.” We follow the story of hisconception and birth, of his renunciation and quest for enlightenment, of hisrealization of the Dhamma, and of his decision to teach. The chapter ends withhis first discourse to the five monks, his first disciples, in the Deer Parknear Bārāṇasī.Chapter III is intended to sketch the special features of the Buddha’s teaching,and by implication, the attitude with which a prospective student shouldapproach the teaching. The texts tell us that the Dhamma is not a secret oresoteric teaching but one which “shines when taught openly.” It does not demandblind faith in authoritarian scriptures, in divine revelations, or infallibledogmas, but invites investigation and appeals to personal experience as theultimate criterion for determining its validity. The teaching is concerned withthe arising and cessation of suffering, which can be observed in one’s ownexperience. It does not set up even the Buddha as an unimpeachable authority butinvites us to examine him to determine whether he fully deserves our trust andconfidence. Finally, it offers a step-by-step procedure whereby we can put theteaching to the test, and by doing so realize the ultimate truth for ourselves.With chapter IV, we come to texts dealing with the first of the three types ofbenefit the Buddha’s teaching is intended to bring. This is called “the welfareand happiness visible in this present life” (diṭṭhadhamma-hitasukha ), thehappiness that comes from following ethical norms in one’s family relationships,livelihood, and communal activities. Although Early Buddhism is often depictedas a radical discipline of renunciation directed to a transcendental goal, theNikāyas reveal the Buddha to have been a compassionate and pragmatic teacherwho was intent on promoting a social order in which people can live togetherpeacefully and harmoniously in accordance with ethical guidelines. This aspectof Early Buddhism is evident in the Buddha’s teachings on the duties of childrento their parents, on the mutual obligations of husbands and wives, on rightlivelihood, on the duties of the ruler toward his subjects, and on theprinciples of communal harmony and respect.The second type of benefit to which the Buddha’s teaching leads is the subjectof chapter V, called the welfare and happiness pertaining to the future life(samparāyika-hitasukha). This is the happiness achieved by obtaining afortunate rebirth and success in future lives through one’s accumulation ofmerit. The term “merit” (puñña) refers to wholesome kamma (Skt: karma)considered in terms of its capacity to produce favorable results within theround of rebirths. I begin this chapter with a selection of texts on theteaching of kamma and rebirth. This leads us to general texts on the idea ofmerit, followed by selections on the three principal “bases of merit” recognizedin the Buddha’s discourses: giving (dāna), moral discipline (sīla), andmeditation (bhāvanā). Since meditation figures prominently in the third typeof benefit, the kind of meditation emphasized here, as a basis for merit, isthat productive of the most abundant mundane fruits, the four “divine abodes”(brahmavihāra ), particularly the development of loving-kindness.Chapter VI is transitional, intended to prepare the way for the chapters tofollow. While demonstrating that the practice of his teaching does indeedconduce to happiness and good fortune within the bounds of mundane life, inorder to lead people beyond these bounds, the Buddha exposes the danger andinadequacy in all conditioned existence. He shows the defects in sensualpleasures, the shortcomings of material success, the inevitability of death, andthe impermanence of all conditioned realms of being. To arouse in his disciplesan aspiration for the ultimate good, Nibbāna, the Buddha again and againunderscores the perils of saṃsāra. Thus this chapter comes to a climax withtwo dramatic texts that dwell on the misery of bondage to the round of repeatedbirth and death.The following four chapters are devoted to the third benefit that the Buddha’steaching is intended to bring: the ultimate good (paramattha), the attainment ofNibbāna. The first of these, chapter VII, gives a general overview of the pathto liberation, which is treated analytically through definitions of the factorsof the Noble Eightfold Path and dynamically through an account of the trainingof the monk. A long sutta on the graduated path surveys the monastic trainingfrom the monk’s initial entry upon the life of renunciation to his attainment ofarahantship, the final goal.Chapter VIII focuses upon the taming of the mind, the major emphasis in themonastic training. I here present texts that discuss the obstacles to mentaldevelopment, the means of overcoming these obstacles, different methods ofmeditation, and the states to be attained when the obstacles are overcome andthe disciple gains mastery over the mind. In this chapter I introduce thedistinction between samatha and vipassanā , serenity and insight, the oneleading to samādhi or concentration, the other to paññā or wisdom. However, Iinclude texts that treat insight only in terms of the methods used to generateit, not in terms of its actual contents.Chapter IX, titled “Shining the Light of Wisdom,” deals with the content ofinsight. For Early Buddhism, and indeed for almost all schools of Buddhism,insight or wisdom is the principal instrument of liberation. Thus in thischapter I focus on the Buddha’s teachings about such topics pivotal to thedevelopment of wisdom as right view, the five aggregates, the six sense bases,the eighteen elements, dependent origination, and the Four Noble Truths. Thischapter ends with a selection of texts on Nibbāna, the ultimate goal of wisdom.The final goal is not achieved abruptly but by passing through a series ofstages that transforms an individual from a worldling into an arahant, aliberated one. Thus chapter X, “The Planes of Realization,” offers a selectionof texts on the main stages along the way. I first present the series of stagesas a progressive sequence; then I return to the starting point and examine threemajor milestones within this progression: stream-entry, the stage ofnonreturner, and arahantship. I conclude with a selection of suttas on theBuddha, the foremost among the arahants, here spoken of under the epithet heused most often when referring to himself, the Tathāgata.THE ORIGINS OF THE NIK̄YASThe texts I have drawn upon to fill out my scheme are, as I said above, allselected from the Nikāyas, the main sutta collections of the Pāli Canon. Somewords are needed to explain the origin and nature of these sources.The Buddha did not write down any of his teachings, nor were his teachingsrecorded in writing by his disciples. Indian culture at the time the Buddhalived was still predominantly preliterate.1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en1] The Buddha wandered from townto town in the Ganges plain, instructing his monks and nuns, giving sermons tothe householders who flocked to hear him speak, answering the questions ofcurious inquirers, and engaging in discussions with people from all classes ofsociety. The records of his teachings that we have do not come from his own penor from transcriptions made by those who heard the teaching from him, but frommonastic councils held after his parinibb̄na—his passing away into Nibbāna—forthe purpose of preserving his teaching.It is unlikely that the teachings that derive from these councils reproduce theBuddha’s words verbatim. The Buddha must have spoken spontaneously andelaborated upon his themes in countless ways in response to the varied needs ofthose who sought his guidance. Preserving by oral transmission such a vast anddiverse range of material would have bordered on the impossible. To mold theteachings into a format suitable for preservation, the monks responsible for thetexts would have had to collate and edit them to make them better fit forlistening, retention, recitation, memorization, and repetition—the five majorelements in oral transmission. This process, which may have already been startedduring the Buddha’s lifetime, would have led to a fair degree of simplificationand standardization of the material to be preserved.During the Buddha’s life, the discourses were classified into nine categoriesaccording to literary genre: sutta (prose discourses), geyya (mixed prose andverse), veyyākaraṇa (answers to questions), gāthā (verse), udāna (inspiredutterances), itivuttaka (memorable sayings), jātaka (stories of past births),abbhutadhamma (marvelous qualities), and vedalla (catechism).2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en2] At some point after hispassing, this older system of classification was superceded by a new scheme thatordered the texts into larger collections called Nikāyas in the TheravādaBuddhist tradition, Āgamas in the North Indian Buddhist schools.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en3] Exactly when theNikāya-Āgama scheme became ascendant is not known with certainty, but once itappeared it almost completely replaced the older system.The Cullavagga, one of the books of the Pāli Vinaya Piṭaka, gives an accountof how the authorized texts were compiled at the first Buddhist council, heldthree months after the Buddha’s parinibbāna. According to this report, shortlyafter the Buddha’s death the Elder Mahākassapa, the de facto head of theSaṅgha, selected five hundred monks, all arahants or liberated ones, to meetand compile an authoritative version of the teachings. The council took placeduring the rains retreat at Rājagaha (modern Rajgir), the capital of Magadha,then the dominant state of Middle India.4[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en4] Mahākassapa first requestedthe Venerable Upāli, the foremost specialist on disciplinary matters, to recitethe Vinaya. On the basis of this recitation, the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Compilationon Discipline, was compiled. Mahākassapa then asked the Venerable Ānanda torecite “the Dhamma,” that is, the discourses, and on the basis of thisrecitation, the Sutta Piṭaka, the Compilation of Discourses, was compiled.The Cullavagga states that when Ānanda recited the Sutta Piṭaka, the Nikāyashad the same contents as they do now, with the suttas arranged in the samesequence as they now appear in the Pāli Canon. This narrative doubtlesslyrecords past history through the lens of a later period. The Āgamas of theBuddhist schools other than the Theravāda correspond to the four main Nikāyas,but they classify suttas differently and arrange their contents in a differentorder from the Pāli Nikāyas. This suggests that if the Nikāya-Āgamaarrangement did arise at the first council, the council had not yet assignedsuttas to their definitive places within this scheme. Alternatively, it ispossible that this scheme arose at a later time. It could have arisen at somepoint after the first council but before the Saṅgha split into differentschools. If it arose during the age of sectarian divisions, it might have beenintroduced by one school and then been borrowed by others, so that the differentschools would assign their texts to different places within the scheme.While the Cullavagga’s account of the first council may include legendarymaterial mixed with historical fact, there seems no reason to doubt Ānanda’srole in the preservation of the discourses. As the Buddha’s personal attendant,Ānanda had learned the discourses from him and the other great disciples, keptthem in mind, and taught them to others. During the Buddha’s life he was praisedfor his retentive capacities and was appointed “foremost of those who havelearned much” (etadaggaṃ bahussutānaṃ).5[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en5] Few monks might have hadmemories that could equal Ānanda’s, but already during the Buddha’s lifetimeindividual monks must already have begun to specialize in particular texts. Thestandardization and simplification of the material would have facilitatedmemorization. Once the texts became classified into the Nikāyas or Āgamas, thechallenges of preserving and transmitting the textual heritage were solved byorganizing the textual specialists into companies dedicated to specificcollections. Different companies within the Saṅgha could thus focus onmemorizing and interpreting different collections and the community as a wholecould avoid placing excessive demands on the memories of individual monks. It isin this way that the teachings would continue to be transmitted for the nextthree or four hundred years, until they were finally committed to writing.6[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en6]In the centuries following the Buddha’s death, the Saṅgha became divided overdisciplinary and doctrinal issues until by the third century after theparinibbāna there were at least eighteen schools of Sectarian Buddhism. Eachsect probably had its own collection of texts regarded more or less ascanonical, though it is possible that several closely affiliated sects sharedthe same collection of authorized texts. While the different Buddhist schoolsmay have organized their collections differently and though their suttas showdifferences of detail, the individual suttas are often remarkably similar,sometimes almost identical, and the doctrines and practices they delineate areessentially the same.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en7] Thedoctrinal differences between the schools did not arise from the suttasthemselves but from the interpretations the textual specialists imposed uponthem. Such differences hardened after the rival schools formalized theirphilosophical principles in treatises and commentaries expressive of theirdistinctive standpoints on doctrinal issues. So far as we can determine, therefined philosophical systems had only minimal impact on the original textsthemselves, which the schools seemed disinclined to manipulate to suit theirdoctrinal agendas. Instead, by means of their commentaries, they endeavored tointerpret the suttas in such a way as to draw out ideas that supported their ownviews. It is not unusual for such interpretations to appear defensive andcontrived, apologetic against the words of the original texts themselves.THE PĀLI CANONSadly, the canonical collections belonging to most of the early mainstreamIndian Buddhist schools were lost when Indian Buddhism was devastated by theMuslims that invaded northern India in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Theseinvasions effectively sounded the death knell for Buddhism in the land of itsbirth. Only one complete collection of texts belonging to one of the earlyIndian Buddhist schools managed to survive intact. This is the collectionpreserved in the language that we know as Pāli. This collection belonged to theancient Theravāda school, which had been transplanted to Sri Lanka in the thirdcentury B.C.E. and thus managed to escape the havoc wrought upon Buddhism in themotherland. About the same time, the Theravāda also spread to southeast Asiaand in later centuries became dominant throughout the region.The Pāli Canon is the collection of texts the Theravāda regards as Word of theBuddha (buddhavacana). The fact that the texts of this collection have survivedas a single canon does not mean that they can all be dated from the same period;nor does it mean that the texts forming its most archaic nucleus are necessarilymore ancient than their counterparts from the other Buddhist schools, many ofwhich have survived in Chinese or Tibetan translation as parts of entire canonsor, in a few cases, as isolated texts in another Indian language. Nevertheless,the Pāli Canon has a special importance for us, and that is so for at leastthree reasons.First, it is a complete collection all belonging to a single school. Even thoughwe can detect clear signs of historical development between different portionsof the canon, this alignment with a single school gives the texts a certaindegree of uniformity. Among the texts stemming from the same period, we can evenspeak of a homogeneity of contents, a single flavor underlying the manifoldexpressions of the doctrine. This homogeneity is most evident in the fourNikāyas and the older parts of the fifth Nikāya and gives us reason to believethat with these texts—allowing for the qualification expressed above, that theyhave counterparts in other extinct Buddhist schools—we have reached the mostancient stratum of Buddhist literature discoverable.Second, the entire collection has been preserved in a Middle Indo-Aryanlanguage, one closely related to the language (or, more likely, the variousregional dialects) that the Buddha himself spoke. We call this language Pāli,but the name for the language actually arose through a misunderstanding. Theword pāli properly means “text,” that is, the canonical text as distinct fromthe commentaries. The commentators refer to the language in which the texts arepreserved as pālibhāsā, “the language of the texts.” At some point, the termwas misunderstood to mean “the Pāli language,” and once the misconceptionarose, it took root and has been with us ever since. Scholars regard thislanguage as a hybrid showing features of several Prakrit dialects used aroundthe third century B.C.E., subjected to a partial process of Sanskritization. 8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en8] While the language is notidentical with any the Buddha himself would have spoken, it belongs to the samebroad linguistic family as those he might have used and originates from the sameconceptual matrix. This language thus reflects the thought-world that the Buddhainherited from the wider Indian culture into which he was born, so that itswords capture the subtle nuances of that thought-world without the intrusion ofalien influences inevitable in even the best and most scrupulous translations.This contrasts with Chinese, Tibetan, or English translations of the texts,which reverberate with the connotations of the words chosen from the targetlanguages.The third reason the Pāli Canon has special importance is that this collectionis authoritative for a contemporary Buddhist school. Unlike the textualcollections of the extinct schools of Early Buddhism, which are purely ofacademic interest, this collection still brims with life. It inspires the faithof millions of Buddhists from the villages and monasteries of Sri Lanka,Myanmar, and Southeast Asia to the cities and meditation centers of Europe andthe Americas. It shapes their understanding, guides them in the face ofdifficult ethical choices, informs their meditative practices, and offers themthe keys to liberating insight.The Pāli Canon is commonly known as the Tipiṭaka, the “Three Baskets” or“Three Compilations.” This threefold classification was not unique to theTheravāda school but was in common use among the Indian Buddhist schools as away to categorize the Buddhist canonical texts. Even today the scripturespreserved in Chinese translation are known as the Chinese Tripiṭaka. The threecompilations of the Pāli Canon are:1. The Vinaya Piṭaka, the Compilation of Discipline, which contains the ruleslaid down for the guidance of the monks and nuns and the regulations prescribedfor the harmonious functioning of the monastic order.2. The Sutta Piṭaka, the Compilation of Discourses, which contains the suttas,the discourses of the Buddha and those of his chief disciples as well asinspirational works in verse, verse narratives, and certain works of acommentarial nature.3. The Abhidhamma Piṭaka, the Compilation of Philosophy, a collection of seventreatises which subject the Buddha’s teachings to rigorous philosophicalsystematization.The Abhidhamma Piṭaka is obviously the product of a later phase in theevolution of Buddhist thought than the other two Piṭakas. The Pāli versionrepresents the Theravāda school’s attempt to systematize the older teachings.Other early schools apparently had their own Abhidhamma systems. TheSarvāstivāda system is the only one whose canonical texts have survived intactin their entirety. Its canonical collection, like the Pāli version, alsoconsists of seven texts. These were originally composed in Sanskrit but arepreserved in full only in Chinese translation. The system they define differssignificantly from that of its Theravāda counterpart in both formulation andphilosophy.The Sutta Piṭaka, which contains the records of the Buddha’s discourses anddiscussions, consists of five collections called Nikāyas. In the age of thecommentators they were also known as Āgamas, like their counterparts innorthern Buddhism. The four major Nikāyas are:1. The Dīgha Nikāya: the Collection of Long Discourses, thirty-four suttasarranged into three vaggas, or books.2. The Majjhima Nikāya: the Collection of Middle Length Discourses, 152 suttasarranged into three vaggas.3. The Saṃyutta Nikāya: the Collection of Connected Discourses, close to threethousand short suttas grouped into fifty-six chapters, called saṃyuttas, whichare in turn collected into five vaggas.4. The Aṅguttara Nikāya: the Collection of Numerical Discourses (or, perhaps,“Incremental Discourses”), approximately 2,400 short suttas arranged into elevenchapters, called nipātas.The Dīgha Nikāya and Majjhima Nikāya, at first glance, seem to be establishedprincipally on the basis of length: the longer discourses go into the Dīgha,the middle-length discourses into the Majjhima. Careful tabulations of theircontents, however, suggest that another factor might underlie the distinctionbetween these two collections. The suttas of the Dīgha Nikāya are largelyaimed at a popular audience and seem intended to attract potential converts tothe teaching by demonstrating the superiority of the Buddha and his doctrine.The suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya are largely directed inward toward theBuddhist community and seem designed to acquaint newly ordained monks with thedoctrines and practices of Buddhism.9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en9] It remains an open questionwhether these pragmatic purposes are the determining criteria behind these twoNikāyas or whether the primary criterion is length, with these pragmaticpurposes following as incidental consequences of their respective differences inlength.The Saṃyutta Nikāya is organized by way of subject matter. Each subject is the“yoke” (saṃyoga) that connects the discourses into a saṃyutta or chapter.Hence the title of the collection, the “connected (saṃyutta) discourses.” Thefirst book, the Book with Verses, is unique in being compiled on the basis ofliterary genre. It contains suttas in mixed prose and verse, arranged in elevenchapters by way of subject. The other four books each contain long chaptersdealing with the principal doctrines of Early Buddhism. Books II, III, and IVeach open with a long chapter devoted to a theme of major importance,respectively, dependent origination (chapter 12: Nidānasaṃyutta); the fiveaggregates (chapter 22: Khandhasaṃyutta); and the six internal and externalsense bases (chapter 35: Saḷāyatanasaṃyutta). Part V deals with the principalgroups of training factors that, in the post-canonical period, come to be calledthe thirty-seven aids to enlightenment (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). These includethe Noble Eightfold Path (chapter 45: Maggasaṃyutta ), the seven factors ofenlightenment (chapter 46: Bojjhaṅgasaṃyutta ), and the four establishments ofmindfulness (chapter 47: Satipaṭṭhānasaṃyutta). From its contents, we mightinfer that the Saṃyutta Nikāya was intended to serve the needs of two groupswithin the monastic order. One consisted of the doctrinal specialists, thosemonks and nuns who sought to explore the deep implications of the Dhamma and toelucidate them for their companions in the religious life. The other consistedof those devoted to the meditative development of insight.The Aṅguttara Nikāya is arranged according to a numerical scheme derived froma peculiar feature of the Buddha’s pedagogic method. To facilitate easycomprehension and memorization, the Buddha often formulated his discourses byway of numerical sets, a format that helped to ensure that the ideas he conveyedwould be easily retained in mind. The Aṅguttara Nikāya assembles thesenumerical discourses into a single massive work of eleven nipātas or chapters,each representing the number of terms upon which the constituent suttas havebeen framed. Thus there is the Chapter of the Ones (ekakanipāta), the Chapterof the Twos (dukanipāta), the Chapter of the Threes (tikanipāta), and soforth, up to and ending with the Chapter of the Elevens (ekādasanipāta ).Since the various groups of path factors have been included in the Saṃyutta,the Aṅguttara can focus on those aspects of the training that have not beenincorporated in the repetitive sets. The Aṅguttara includes a notableproportion of suttas addressed to lay followers dealing with the ethical andspiritual concerns of life within the world, including family relationships(husbands and wives, children and parents) and the proper ways to acquire, save,and utilize wealth. Other suttas deal with the practical training of monks. Thenumerical arrangement of this collection makes it particularly convenient forformal instruction, and thus it could easily be drawn upon by elder monks whenteaching their pupils and by preachers when giving sermons to the laity.Besides the four major Nikāyas, the Pāli Sutta Piṭaka includes a fifthNikāya, called the Khuddaka Nikāya. This name means the Minor Collection.Perhaps it originally consisted merely of a number of minor works that could notbe included in the four major Nikāyas. But as more and more works were composedover the centuries and added to it, its dimensions swelled until it became themost voluminous of the five Nikāyas. At the heart of the Khuddaka, however, isa small constellation of short works composed either entirely in verse (namely,the Dhammapada, the Theragāthā, and the Therīgāthā) or in mixed prose andverse (the Suttanipāta, the Udāna, and the Itivuttaka) whose style andcontents suggest that they are of great antiquity. Other texts of the KhuddakaNikāya—such as the Paṭisambhidāmagga and the two Niddesas—represent thestandpoint of the Theravāda school and thus must have been composed during theperiod of Sectarian Buddhism, when the early schools had taken their separatepaths of doctrinal development.The four Nikāyas of the Pāli Canon have counterparts in the Āgamas of theChinese Tripiṭaka, though these are from different early schools. Correspondingto each respectively there is a Dirghāgama, probably stemming from theDharmaguptaka school, originally translated from a Prakrit; a Madhyamāgama andSamyuktāgama, both stemming from the Sarvāstivāda school and translated fromSanskrit; and an Ekottarāgama, corresponding to the Aṅguttara Nikāya,generally thought to have belonged to a branch of the Mahāsāṅghika school andto have been translated from a dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan or a mixed dialectof Prakrit with Sanskrit elements. The Chinese Tripiṭaka also containstranslations of individual sūtras from the four collections, perhaps from stillother unidentified schools, and translations of individual books from the MinorCollection, including two translations of a Dhammapada (one said to be veryclose to the Pāli version) and parts of the Suttanipāta, which, as a unifiedwork, does not exist in Chinese translation.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_000.html#en10]A NOTE ON STYLEReaders of the Pāli suttas are often annoyed by the repetitiveness of thetexts. It is difficult to tell how much of this stems from the Buddha himself,who as an itinerant preacher must have used repetition to reinforce his points,and how much is due to the compilers. It is obvious, however, that a highproportion of the repetitiveness derives from the process of oral transmission.To avoid excessive repetitiveness in the translation I have had to make ampleuse of elisions. In this respect I follow the printed editions of the Pālitexts, which are also highly abridged, but a translation intended for acontemporary reader requires still more compression if it is to avoid riskingthe reader’s wrath. On the other hand, I have been keen to see that nothingessential to the original text, including the flavor, has been lost due to theabridgment. The ideals of considerateness to the reader and fidelity to the textsometimes make contrary demands on a translator.The treatment of repetition patterns in which the same utterance is maderegarding a set of items is a perpetual problem in translating Pāli suttas.When translating a sutta about the five aggregates, for example, one is temptedto forgo the enumeration of the individual aggregates and instead turn the suttainto a general statement about the aggregates as a class. To my mind, such anapproach risks turning translation into paraphrase and thereby losing too muchof the original. My general policy has been to translate the full utterance inrelation to the first and last members of the set and merely to enumerate theintermediate members separated by ellipsis points. Thus, in a sutta about thefive aggregates, I render the statement in full only for form and consciousness,and in between have “feeling … perception … volitional formations …,” implyingthereby that the full statement likewise applies to them.This approach has required the frequent use of ellipsis points, a practice thatalso invites criticism. When faced with repetitive passages in the narrativeframework, I have sometimes condensed them rather than use ellipsis points toshow where text is being elided. However, with texts of doctrinal exposition Iadhere to the practice described in the preceding paragraph. I think thetranslator has the responsibility, when translating passages of doctrinalsignificance, to show exactly where text is being elided, and for this ellipsispoints remain the best tool at hand."},{"pageContent":"I. The Human Condition006 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_006_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONLike other religious teachings, the Buddha’s teaching originates as a responseto the strains at the heart of the human condition. What distinguishes histeaching from other religious approaches to the human condition is thedirectness, thoroughness, and uncompromising realism with which he looks atthese strains. The Buddha does not offer us palliatives that leave theunderlying maladies untouched beneath the surface; rather, he traces ourexistential illness down to its most fundamental causes, so persistent anddestructive, and shows us how these can be totally uprooted. However, while theDhamma will eventually lead to the wisdom that eradicates the causes ofsuffering, it does not begin there but with observations about the hard facts ofeveryday experience. Here too its directness, thoroughness, and tough realismare evident. The teaching begins by calling upon us to develop a faculty calledyoniso manasikāra, careful attention. The Buddha asks us to stop driftingthoughtlessly through our lives and instead to pay careful attention to simpletruths that are everywhere available to us, clamoring for the sustainedconsideration they deserve.One of the most obvious and inescapable of these truths is also among the mostdifficult for us to fully acknowledge, namely, that we are bound to grow old,fall ill, and die. It is commonly assumed that the Buddha beckons us torecognize the reality of old age and death in order to motivate us to enter thepath of renunciation leading to Nibbāna, complete liberation from the round ofbirth and death. However, while this may be his ultimate intention, it is notthe first response he seeks to evoke in us when we turn to him for guidance. Theinitial response the Buddha intends to arouse in us is an ethical one. Bycalling our attention to our bondage to old age and death, he seeks to inspirein us a firm resolution to turn away from unwholesome ways of living and toembrace instead wholesome alternatives.Again, the Buddha grounds his initial ethical appeal not only upon acompassionate feeling for other beings, but also upon our instinctive concernfor our own long-term welfare and happiness. He tries to make us see that to actin accordance with ethical guidelines will enable us to secure our ownwell-being both now and in the long-term future. His argument hinges on theimportant premise that actions have consequences. If we are to alter ouraccustomed ways, we must be convinced of the validity of this principle.Specifically, to change from a self-stultifying way of life to one that is trulyfruitful and inwardly rewarding, we must realize that our actions haveconsequences for ourselves, consequences that can rebound upon us both in thislife and in subsequent lives.The three suttas that constitute the first section of this chapter establishthis point eloquently, each in its own way. Text I,1(1) enunciates theinevitable law that all beings who have taken birth must undergo aging anddeath. Although at first glance the discourse seems to be stating a mere fact ofnature, by citing as examples members of the upper strata of society (wealthyrulers, brahmins, and householders) and liberated arahants, it insinuates asubtle moral message into its words. Text I,1(2) brings out this message moreexplicitly with its impressive simile of the mountain, which drives home thepoint that when “aging and death are rolling in” on us, our task in life is tolive righteously and do wholesome and meritorious deeds. The sutta on the“divine messengers”—Text I,1(3)—establishes the corollary to this: when we failto recognize the “divine messengers” in our midst, when we miss the hiddenwarning signals of old age, illness, and death, we become negligent and behaverecklessly, creating unwholesome kamma with the potential to yield dreadfulconsequences.The realization that we are bound to grow old and die breaks the spell ofinfatuation cast over us by sensual pleasures, wealth, and power. It dispels themist of confusion and motivates us to take fresh stock of our purposes in life.We may not be ready to give up family and possessions for a life of homelesswandering and solitary meditation, but this is not an option the Buddhagenerally expects of his householder disciples. Rather, as we saw above, thefirst lesson he draws from the fact that our lives end in old age and death isan ethical one interwoven with the twin principles of kamma and rebirth. The lawof kamma stipulates that our unwholesome and wholesome actions have consequencesextending far beyond this present life: unwholesome actions lead to rebirth instates of misery and bring future pain and suffering; wholesome actions lead toa pleasant rebirth and bring future well-being and happiness. Since we have togrow old and die, we should be constantly aware that any present prosperity wemight enjoy is merely temporary. We can enjoy it only as long as we are youngand healthy; and when we die, our newly acquired kamma will gain the opportunityto ripen and bring forth its own results. We must then reap the due fruits ofour deeds. With an eye to our long-term future welfare, we should scrupulouslyavoid evil deeds that result in suffering and diligently engage in wholesomedeeds that generate happiness here and in future lives.In the second section, we explore three aspects of human life that I havecollected under the heading “The Tribulations of Unreflective Living.” Thesetypes of suffering differ from those connected with old age and death in animportant respect. Old age and death are bound up with bodily existence and arethus unavoidable, common to both ordinary people and liberated arahants—a pointmade in the first text of this chapter. In contrast, the three texts included inthis section all distinguish between the ordinary person, called “theuninstructed worldling” (assutavā puthujjana), and the wise follower of theBuddha, called the “instructed noble disciple” (sutavā ariyasāvaka).The first of these distinctions, drawn in Text I,2(1), revolves around theresponse to painful feelings. Both the worldling and the noble discipleexperience painful bodily feelings, but they respond to these feelingsdifferently. The worldling reacts to them with aversion and therefore, on top ofthe painful bodily feeling, also experiences a painful mental feeling: sorrow,resentment, or distress. The noble disciple, when afflicted with bodily pain,endures such feeling patiently, without sorrow, resentment, or distress. It iscommonly assumed that physical and mental pain are inseparably linked, but theBuddha makes a clear demarcation between the two. He holds that while bodilyexistence is inevitably bound up with physical pain, such pain need not triggerthe emotional reactions of misery, fear, resentment, and distress with which wehabitually respond to it. Through mental training we can develop the mindfulnessand clear comprehension necessary to endure physical pain courageously, withpatience and equanimity. Through insight we can develop sufficient wisdom toovercome our dread of painful feelings and our need to seek relief indistracting binges of sensual self-indulgence.Another aspect of human life that brings to the fore the differences between theworldling and the noble disciple is the changing vicissitudes of fortune. TheBuddhist texts neatly reduce these to four pairs of opposites, known as theeight worldly conditions (aṭṭha lokadhammā): gain and loss, fame anddisrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. Text I,2(2) shows how theworldling and the noble disciple differ in their responses to these changes.While the worldling is elated by success in achieving gain, fame, praise, andpleasure, and dejected when confronted with their undesired opposites, the nobledisciple remains unperturbed. By applying the understanding of impermanence toboth favorable and unfavorable conditions, the noble disciple can abide inequanimity, not attached to favorable conditions, not repelled by unfavorableones. Such a disciple gives up likes and dislikes, sorrow and distress, andultimately wins the highest blessing of all: complete freedom from suffering.Text I,2(3) examines the plight of the worldling at a still more fundamentallevel. Because they misconceive things, worldlings are agitated by change,especially when that change affects their own bodies and minds. The Buddhaclassifies the constituents of body and mind into five categories known as “thefive aggregates subject to clinging” (pañc’upādānakkhandhā): form, feeling,perception, volitional formations, and consciousness (for details, see pp.305–07). These five aggregates are the building blocks that we typically use toconstruct our sense of personal identity; they are the things that we cling toas being “mine,” “I,” and “my self.” Whatever we identify with, whatever we taketo be a self or the possessions of a self, can all be classified among thesefive aggregates. The five aggregates are thus the ultimate grounds of“identification” and “appropriation,” the two basic activities by which weestablish a sense of selfhood. Since we invest our notions of selfhood andpersonal identity with an intense emotional concern, when the objects to whichthey are fastened—the five aggregates—undergo change, we naturally experienceanxiety and distress. In our perception, it is not mere impersonal phenomenathat are undergoing change, but our very identities, our cherished selves, andthis is what we fear most of all. However, as the present text shows, a nobledisciple has clearly seen with wisdom the delusive nature of all notions ofpermanent selfhood and thus no longer identifies with the five aggregates.Therefore the noble disciple can confront their change without anxious concern,unperturbed in the face of their alteration, decay, and destruction.Agitation and turmoil afflict human life not only at the personal and privatelevel, but also in our social interactions. From the most ancient times, ourworld has always been one of violent confrontations and conflict. The names,places, and instruments of destruction may change, but the forces behind them,the motivations, the expressions of greed and hate, remain fairly constant. TheNikāyas testify that the Buddha was intensely aware of this dimension of thehuman condition. Although his teaching, with its stress on ethicalself-discipline and mental self-cultivation, aims primarily at personalenlightenment and liberation, the Buddha also sought to offer people a refugefrom the violence and injustice that rack human lives in such cruel ways. Thisis apparent in his emphasis on loving-kindness and compassion; on harmlessnessin action and gentleness in speech; and on the peaceful resolution of disputes.The third section of this chapter includes four short texts dealing with theunderlying roots of violent conflict and injustice. We can see from these textsthat the Buddha does not clamor for changes merely in the outer structures ofsociety. He demonstrates that these dark phenomena are external projections ofthe unwholesome proclivities of the human mind and thus points to the need forinner change as a parallel condition for establishing peace and social justice.Each of the four texts included in this section traces conflict, violence,political oppression, and economic injustice back to their causes; each in itsown way locates these causes within the mind.Text I,3(1) explains conflicts between laypeople as arising from attachment tosensual pleasures, conflicts between ascetics as arising from attachment toviews. Text I,3(2), a dialogue between the Buddha and Sakka, the pre-BuddhisticIndian ruler of the devas, traces hatred and enmity to envy and niggardliness;from there the Buddha traces them back to fundamental distortions that affectthe way our perception and cognition process the information provided by thesenses. Text I,3(3) offers another version of the famous chain of causation,which proceeds from feeling to craving, and from craving via other conditions to“the taking up of clubs and weapons” and other types of violent behavior. TextI,3(4) depicts how the three roots of evil—greed, hatred, and delusion—haveterrible repercussions on a whole society, issuing in violence, the lust forpower, and the unjust infliction of suffering. All four texts imply that anysignificant and lasting transformations of society require significant changesin the moral fiber of individual human beings; for as long as greed, hatred, anddelusion run rampant as determinants of conduct, the consequences are bound tobe consistently detrimental.The Buddha’s teaching addresses a fourth aspect of the human condition which,unlike the three we have so far examined, is not immediately perceptible to us.This is our bondage to the round of rebirths. From the selection of textsincluded in the final section in this chapter, we see that the Buddha teachesour individual lifespan to be merely a single phase within a series of rebirthsthat has been proceeding without any discernible beginning in time. This seriesof rebirths is called saṃsāra, a Pāli word which suggests the idea ofdirectionless wandering. No matter how far back in time we may seek a beginningto the universe, we never find an initial moment of creation. No matter how farback we may trace any given individual sequence of lives, we can never arrive ata first point. According to Texts I,4(1) and I,4(2), even if we were to tracethe sequence of our mothers and fathers across world systems, we would only comeupon still more mothers and fathers stretching back into the far horizons.Moreover, the process is not only beginningless but is also potentially endless.As long as ignorance and craving remain intact, the process will continueindefinitely into the future with no end in sight. For the Buddha and EarlyBuddhism, this is above all the defining crisis at the heart of the humancondition: we are bound to a chain of rebirths, and bound to it by nothing otherthan our own ignorance and craving. The pointless wandering on in saṃsāraoccurs against a cosmic background of inconceivably vast dimensions. The periodof time that it takes for a world system to evolve, reach its phase of maximumexpansion, contract, and then disintegrate is called a kappa (Skt: kalpa), aneon. Text I,4(3) offers a vivid simile to suggest the eon’s duration; TextI,4(4), another vivid simile to illustrate the incalculable number of the eonsthrough which we have wandered.As beings wander and roam from life to life, shrouded in darkness, they fallagain and again into the chasm of birth, aging, sickness, and death. But becausetheir craving propels them forward in a relentless quest for gratification, theyseldom pause long enough to step back and attend carefully to their existentialplight. As Text I,4(5) states, they instead just keep revolving around the “fiveaggregates” in the way a dog on a leash might run around a post or pillar. Sincetheir ignorance prevents them from recognizing the vicious nature of theircondition, they cannot discern even the tracks of a path to deliverance. Mostbeings live immersed in the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. Others, driven bythe need for power, status, and esteem, pass their lives in vain attempts tofill an unquenchable thirst. Many, fearful of annihilation at death, constructbelief systems that ascribe to their individual selves, their souls, theprospect of eternal life. A few yearn for a path to liberation but do not knowwhere to find one. It was precisely to offer such a path that the Buddha hasappeared in our midst.I. THE HUMAN CONDITION1. OLD AGE, ILLNESS, AND DEATH(1) AGING AND DEATHAt Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,is anyone who is born free from aging and death?”1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en11]“Great king, no one who is born is free from aging and death. Even thoseaffluent khattiyas—rich, with great wealth and property, with abundant gold andsilver, abundant treasures and commodities, abundant wealth and grain—becausethey have been born, are not free from aging and death. Even those affluentbrahmins … affluent householders—rich … with abundant wealth and grain—becausethey have been born, are not free from aging and death. Even those monks who arearahants, whose taints are destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done whathad to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyedthe fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge:even for them this body is subject to breaking up, subject to being laid down.2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en12]“The beautiful chariots of kings wear out,This body too undergoes decay.But the Dhamma of the good does not decay:So the good proclaim along with the good.”(SN 3:3; I 71 <163–64>)(2) THE SIMILE OF THE MOUNTAINAt Sāvatthī, in the middle of the day, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached theBlessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One thenasked him: “Now where are you coming from, great king, in the middle of theday?”“Just now, venerable sir, I have been engaged in those affairs of kingshiptypical for kings, who are intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, whoare obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control intheir country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory onearth.”“What do you think, great king? Suppose a man would come to you from the east,one who is trustworthy and reliable, and would tell you: ‘For sure, great king,you should know this: I am coming from the east, and there I saw a greatmountain high as the clouds coming this way, crushing all living beings. Dowhatever you think should be done, great king.’ Then a second man would come toyou from the west ... a third man from the north ... and a fourth man from thesouth, one who is trustworthy and reliable, and would tell you: ‘For sure, greatking, you should know this: I am coming from the south, and there I saw a greatmountain high as the clouds coming this way, crushing all living beings. Dowhatever you think should be done, great king.’ If, great king, such a greatperil should arise, such a terrible destruction of human life, the human statebeing so difficult to obtain, what should be done?”“If, venerable sir, such a great peril should arise, such a terrible destructionof human life, the human state being so difficult to obtain, what else should bedone but to live by the Dhamma, to live righteously, and to do wholesome andmeritorious deeds?”“I inform you, great king, I announce to you, great king: aging and death arerolling in on you. When aging and death are rolling in on you, great king, whatshould be done?”“As aging and death are rolling in on me, venerable sir, what else should bedone but to live by the Dhamma, to live righteously, and to do wholesome andmeritorious deeds?“Venerable sir, kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, obsessedby greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable control in theircountry and rule over a great sphere of territory, conquer by means of elephantbattles, cavalry battles, chariot battles, and infantry battles; but there is nohope of victory by such battles, no chance of success, when aging and death arerolling in. In this royal court, venerable sir, there are counselors who, whenthe enemies arrive, are capable of dividing them by subterfuge; but there is nohope of victory by subterfuge, no chance of success, when aging and death arerolling in. In this royal court, venerable sir, there exists abundant bullionand gold stored in vaults and lofts, and with such wealth we are capable ofmollifying the enemies when they come; but there is no hope of victory bywealth, no chance of success, when aging and death are rolling in. As aging anddeath are rolling in on me, venerable sir, what else should I do but live by theDhamma, live righteously, and do wholesome and meritorious deeds?”“So it is, great king! So it is, great king! As aging and death are rolling inon you, what else should you do but live by the Dhamma, live righteously, and dowholesome and meritorious deeds?”This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, theTeacher, further said this:“Just as mountains of solid rock,Massive, reaching to the sky,Might draw together from all sides,Crushing all in the four quarters—So aging and death comeRolling over living beings— “Khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, suddas,Outcasts and scavengers:They spare none along the wayBut come crushing everything. “There’s no hope there for victoryBy elephant troops, chariots, and infantry.One can’t defeat them by subterfuge,Or buy them off by means of wealth. “Therefore a person of wisdom here,Out of regard for his own good,Steadfast, should settle faithIn the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. “When one conducts oneself by DhammaWith body, speech, and mind,They praise one here in the present life,And after death one rejoices in heaven.”(SN 3:25; I 100–102 <224–29>)(3) THE DIVINE MESSENGERS“There are, monks, three divine messengers.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en13] What three?“There is a person of bad conduct in body, speech, and mind. On the dissolutionof the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a baddestination, in a lower world, in hell. There the warders of hell seize him byboth arms and take him before Yama, the Lord of Death,4[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en14] saying: ‘This man, yourmajesty, had no respect for father and mother, nor for ascetics and brahmins,nor did he honor the elders of the family. May your majesty inflict duepunishment on him!’“Then, monks, King Yama questions that man, examines him, and addresses himconcerning the first divine messenger: ‘Didn’t you ever see, my good man, thefirst divine messenger appearing among humankind?’“And he replies: ‘No, Lord, I did not see him.’“Then King Yama says to him: ‘But, my good man, didn’t you ever see a woman or aman, eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, frail, bent like a roof bracket,crooked, leaning on a stick, shakily going along, ailing, youth and vigor gone,with broken teeth, with gray and scanty hair or bald, wrinkled, with blotchedlimbs?’“And the man replies: ‘Yes, Lord, I have seen this.’“Then King Yama says to him: ‘My good man, didn’t it ever occur to you, anintelligent and mature person, “I too am subject to old age and cannot escapeit. Let me now do noble deeds by body, speech, and mind”?’“‘No, Lord, I could not do it. I was negligent.’“Then King Yama says: ‘Through negligence, my good man, you have failed to donoble deeds by body, speech, and mind. Well, you will be treated as befits yournegligence. That evil action of yours was not done by mother or father,brothers, sisters, friends or companions, nor by relatives, devas, ascetics, orbrahmins. But you alone have done that evil deed, and you will have toexperience the fruit.’“When, monks, King Yama has questioned, examined, and addressed him thusconcerning the first divine messenger, he again questions, examines, andaddresses the man about the second one, saying: ‘Didn’t you ever see, my goodman, the second divine messenger appearing among humankind?’“‘No, Lord, I did not see him.’“‘But, my good man, didn’t you ever see a woman or a man who was sick and inpain, seriously ill, lying in his own filth, having to be lifted up by some andput to bed by others?’“‘Yes, Lord, I have seen this.’“‘My good man, didn’t it ever occur to you, an intelligent and mature person, “Itoo am subject to illness and cannot escape it. Let me now do noble deeds bybody, speech, and mind”?’“‘No, Lord, I could not do it. I was negligent.’“‘Through negligence, my good man, you have failed to do noble deeds by body,speech, and mind. Well, you will be treated as befits your negligence. That evilaction of yours was not done by mother or father, brothers, sisters, friends orcompanions, nor by relatives, devas, ascetics, or brahmins. But you alone havedone that evil deed, and you will have to experience the fruit.’“When, monks, King Yama has questioned, examined, and addressed him thusconcerning the second divine messenger, he again questions, examines, andaddresses the man about the third one, saying: ‘Didn’t you ever see, my goodman, the third divine messenger appearing among humankind?’“‘No, Lord, I did not see him.’“‘But, my good man, didn’t you ever see a woman or a man one, two, or three daysdead, the corpse swollen, discolored, and festering?’“‘Yes, Lord, I have seen this.’“‘Then, my good man, didn’t it ever occur to you, an intelligent and matureperson, “I too am subject to death and cannot escape it. Let me now do nobledeeds by body, speech, and mind”?’“‘No, Lord, I could not do it. I was negligent.’“‘Through negligence, my good man, you have failed to do noble deeds by body,speech, and mind. Well, you will be treated as befits your negligence. That evilaction of yours was not done by mother or father, brothers, sisters, friends orcompanions, nor by relatives, devas, ascetics, or brahmins. But you alone havedone that evil deed, and you will have to experience the fruit.’”(from AN 3:35; I 138–40)2. THE TRIBULATIONS OF UNREFLECTIVE LIVING(1) THE DART OF PAINFUL FEELING“Monks, when the uninstructed worldling experiences a painful feeling, hesorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomesdistraught. He feels two feelings—a bodily one and a mental one. Suppose theywere to strike a man with a dart, and then strike him immediately afterward witha second dart, so that the man would feel a feeling caused by two darts. So too,when the uninstructed worldling experiences a painful feeling, he feels twofeelings—a bodily one and a mental one.“While experiencing that same painful feeling, he harbors aversion toward it.When he harbors aversion toward painful feeling, the underlying tendency toaversion toward painful feeling lies behind this.5[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en15] While experiencing painfulfeeling, he seeks delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because theuninstructed worldling does not know of any escape from painful feeling otherthan sensual pleasure.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en16] Whenhe seeks delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to lust forpleasant feeling lies behind this. He does not understand as it really is theorigin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape inthe case of these feelings.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en17]When he does not understand these things, the underlying tendency to ignorancein regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling lies behind this.“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a painfulfeeling, he feels it attached. If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling, he feels it attached. This, monks, is called an uninstructed worldlingwho is attached to birth, aging, and death; who is attached to sorrow,lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; who is attached to suffering, I say.“Monks, when the instructed noble disciple experiences a painful feeling, hedoes not sorrow, grieve, or lament; he does not weep beating his breast andbecome distraught.8 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en18] He feelsone feeling—a bodily one, not a mental one. Suppose they were to strike a manwith a dart, but they would not strike him immediately afterward with a seconddart, so that the man would feel a feeling caused by one dart only. So too, whenthe instructed noble disciple experiences a painful feeling, he feels onefeeling—a bodily one, and not a mental one.“While experiencing that same painful feeling, he harbors no aversion toward it.Since he harbors no aversion toward painful feeling, the underlying tendency toaversion toward painful feeling does not lie behind this. While experiencingpainful feeling, he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason?Because the instructed noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feelingother than sensual pleasure. Since he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure,the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie behind this.He understands as it really is the origin and the passing away, thegratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these feelings. Sincehe understands these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard toneither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling does not lie behind this.“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a painfulfeeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling, he feels it detached. This, monks, is called a noble disciple who isdetached from birth, aging, and death; who is detached from sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair; who is detached from suffering, I say.“This, monks, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between theinstructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling.”(SN 36:6; IV 207–10)(2) THE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE“These eight worldly conditions, monks, keep the world turning around, and theworld turns around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain and loss,fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.“These eight worldly conditions, monks, are encountered by an uninstructedworldling, and they are also encountered by an instructed noble disciple. Whatnow is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between an instructednoble disciple and an uninstructed worldling?”“Venerable sir, our knowledge of these things has its roots in the Blessed One;it has the Blessed One as guide and resort. It would be good, venerable sir, ifthe Blessed One would clarify the meaning of that statement. Having heard itfrom him, the monks will bear it in mind.”“Listen then, monks, and attend carefully. I shall speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” the monks replied. The Blessed One then spoke thus:“When an uninstructed worldling, monks, comes upon gain, he does not reflect onit thus: ‘This gain that has come to me is impermanent, bound up with suffering,subject to change.’ He does not know it as it really is. And when he comes uponloss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, he does not reflect on them thus:‘All these are impermanent, bound up with suffering, subject to change.’ He doesnot know them as they really are. With such a person, gain and loss, fame anddisrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain keep his mind engrossed. Whengain comes he is elated and when he meets with loss he is dejected. When famecomes he is elated and when he meets with disrepute he is dejected. When praisecomes he is elated and when he meets with blame he is dejected. When heexperiences pleasure he is elated and when he experiences pain he is dejected.Being thus involved in likes and dislikes, he will not be freed from birth,aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; hewill not be freed from suffering, I say.“But, monks, when an instructed noble disciple comes upon gain, he reflects onit thus: ‘This gain that has come to me is impermanent, bound up with suffering,subject to change.’ And so he will reflect when loss and so forth come upon him.He understands all these things as they really are, and they do not engross hismind. Thus he will not be elated by gain and dejected by loss; elated by fameand dejected by disrepute; elated by praise and dejected by blame; elated bypleasure and dejected by pain. Having thus given up likes and dislikes, he willbe freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair; he will be freed from suffering, I say.“This, monks, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between aninstructed noble disciple and an uninstructed worldling.”(AN 8:6; IV 157–59)(3) ANXIETY DUE TO CHANGE“Monks, I will teach you agitation through clinging and non-agitation throughnonclinging.9 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en19] Listen andattend carefully. I shall speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“And how, monks, is there agitation through clinging? Here, monks, theuninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled andundisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and isunskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self aspossessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en20] That form of his changes andalters. With the change and alteration of form, his consciousness becomespreoccupied with the change of form. Agitation and a constellation of mentalstates born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mind.Because his mind is obsessed, he is frightened, distressed, and anxious, andthrough clinging he becomes agitated.“He regards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations asself ... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, orconsciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That consciousness of hischanges and alters. With the change and alteration of consciousness, hisconsciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of consciousness. Agitationand a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change ofconsciousness remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is obsessed, he isfrightened, distressed, and anxious, and through clinging he becomes agitated.“It is in such a way, monks, that there is agitation through clinging.“And how, monks, is there non-agitation through nonclinging? Here, monks, theinstructed noble disciple, who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled anddisciplined in their Dhamma, who is a seer of superior persons and is skilledand disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as self, or self aspossessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.11[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en21] That form of his changes andalters. Despite the change and alteration of form, his consciousness does notbecome preoccupied with the change of form. No agitation and constellation ofmental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing hismind. Because his mind is not obsessed, he is not frightened, distressed, oranxious, and through nonclinging he does not become agitated.“He does not regard feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitionalformations as self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessingconsciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. Thatconsciousness of his changes and alters. Despite the change and alteration ofconsciousness, his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change ofconsciousness. No agitation and constellation of mental states born ofpreoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mind.Because his mind is not obsessed, he is not frightened, distressed, or anxious,and through nonclinging he does not become agitated.“It is in such a way, monks, that there is non-agitation through nonclinging.”(SN 22:7; III 15–18)3. A WORLD IN TURMOIL(1) THE ORIGIN OF CONFLICTThe brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna,12[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en22] exchanged friendly greetingswith him, and asked him: “Why is it, Master Kaccāna, that khattiyas fight withkhattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders?”“It is, brahmin, because of attachment to sensual pleasures, adherence tosensual pleasures, fixation on sensual pleasures, addiction to sensualpleasures, obsession with sensual pleasures, holding firmly to sensual pleasuresthat khattiyas fight with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householderswith householders.”“Why is it, Master Kaccāna, that ascetics fight with ascetics?”“It is, brahmin, because of attachment to views, adherence to views, fixation onviews, addiction to views, obsession with views, holding firmly to views thatascetics fight with ascetics.”(AN 2: iv, 6, abridged; I 66)(2) WHY DO BEINGS LIVE IN HATE?2.1. Sakka, ruler of the devas,13[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en23] asked the Blessed One:“Beings wish to live without hate, harming, hostility, or enmity; they wish tolive in peace. Yet they live in hate, harming one another, hostile, and asenemies. By what fetters are they bound, sir, that they live in such a way?”[The Blessed One said:] “Ruler of the devas, it is the bonds of envy andniggardliness that bind beings so that, although they wish to live without hate,hostility, or enmity, and to live in peace, yet they live in hate, harming oneanother, hostile, and as enemies.”This was the Blessed One’s reply, and Sakka, delighted, exclaimed: “So it is,Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! Through the Blessed One’s answer I haveovercome my doubt and gotten rid of uncertainty.” 2.2. Then Sakka, havingexpressed his appreciation, asked another question: “But, sir, what gives riseto envy and niggardliness, what is their origin, how are they born, how do theyarise? When what is present do they arise, and when what is absent do they notarise?”“Envy and niggardliness, ruler of the devas, arise from liking and disliking;this is their origin, this is how they are born, how they arise. When these arepresent, they arise, when these are absent, they do not arise.”“But, sir, what gives rise to liking and disliking…?”—“They arise, ruler of thedevas, from desire.…”—“And what gives rise to desire…?” —“It arises, ruler ofthe devas, from thinking. When the mind thinks about something, desire arises;when the mind thinks of nothing, desire does not arise.”“But, sir, what gives rise to thinking…?”“Thinking, ruler of the devas, arises from elaborated perceptions and notions.14[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en24] When elaborated perceptionsand notions are present, thinking arises. When elaborated perceptions andnotions are absent, thinking does not arise.”(from DN 21: Sakkapañha Sutta; II 276–77)(3) THE DARK CHAIN OF CAUSATION9. “Thus, Ānanda, in dependence upon feeling there is craving; in dependenceupon craving there is pursuit; in dependence upon pursuit there is gain; independence upon gain there is decision-making; in dependence upondecision-making there is desire and lust; in dependence upon desire and lustthere is attachment; in dependence upon attachment there is possessiveness; independence upon possessiveness there is niggardliness; in dependence uponniggardliness there is defensiveness; and because of defensiveness, various evilunwholesome things originate—the taking up of clubs and weapons, conflicts,quarrels, and disputes, insults, slander, and falsehood.”15[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en25](from DN 15: Mahānidāna Sutta; II 58)(4) THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION“Greed, hatred, and delusion of every kind are unwholesome.16[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en26] Whatever action a greedy,hating, and deluded person heaps up—by deeds, words, or thoughts—that too isunwholesome. Whatever suffering such a person, overpowered by greed, hatred, anddelusion, his thoughts controlled by them, inflicts under false pretexts uponanother—by killing, imprisonment, confiscation of property, false accusations,or expulsion—being prompted in this by the thought, ‘I have power and I wantpower,’ all this is unwholesome too.”(from AN 3:69; I 201–2)4. WITHOUT DISCOVERABLE BEGINNING(1) GRASS AND STICKSThe Blessed One said this: “Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverablebeginning.17 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en27] A first pointis not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance andfettered by craving. Suppose, monks, a man would cut up whatever grass, sticks,branches, and foliage there are in this Jambudīpa18[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en28] and collect them togetherinto a single heap. Having done so, he would put them down, saying for each one:‘This is my mother, this my mother’s mother.’ The sequence of that man’s mothersand grandmothers would not come to an end, yet the grass, sticks, branches, andfoliage in this Jambudīpa would be used up and exhausted. For what reason?Because, monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first pointis not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance andfettered by craving. For such a long time, monks, you have experiencedsuffering, anguish, and disaster, and swelled the cemetery. It is enough tobecome disenchanted with all formations, enough to become dispassionate towardthem, enough to be liberated from them.”(SN 15:1; II 178)(2) BALLS OF CLAY“Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is notdiscerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fetteredby craving. Suppose, monks, a man would reduce this great earth to balls of claythe size of jujube kernels and put them down, saying [for each one]: ‘This is myfather, this my father’s father.’ The sequence of that man’s fathers andgrandfathers would not come to an end, yet this great earth would be used up andexhausted. For what reason? Because, monks, this saṃsāra is withoutdiscoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming andwandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a longtime, monks, you have experienced suffering, anguish, and disaster, and swelledthe cemetery. It is enough to become disenchanted with all formations, enough tobecome dispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.”(SN 15:2; II 179)(3) THE MOUNTAINA certain monk approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to oneside, and said to him: “Venerable sir, how long is an eon?”19[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en29]“An eon is long, monk. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many years,or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundredsof thousands of years.”“Then is it possible to give a simile, venerable sir?”“It is possible, monk,” the Blessed One said. “Suppose, monk, there was a greatstone mountain a yojana long, a yojana wide, and a yojana high, without holes orcrevices, one solid mass of rock.20[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_001.html#en30] At the end of every hundredyears a man would stroke it once with a piece of fine cloth. That great stonemountain might by this effort be worn away and eliminated but the eon wouldstill not have come to an end. So long is an eon, monk. And of eons of suchlength, we have wandered through so many eons, so many hundreds of eons, so manythousands of eons, so many hundreds of thousands of eons. For what reason?Because, monk, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning…. It is enoughto be liberated from them.”(SN 15:5; II 181–82)(4) THE RIVER GANGESAt Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary, a certain brahminapproached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they hadconcluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and askedhim: “Master Gotama, how many eons have elapsed and gone by?”“Brahmin, many eons have elapsed and gone by. It is not easy to count them andsay they are so many eons, or so many hundreds of eons, or so many thousands ofeons, or so many hundreds of thousands of eons.”“But is it possible to give a simile, Master Gotama?”“It is possible, brahmin,” the Blessed One said. “Imagine, brahmin, the grainsof sand between the point where the river Ganges originates and the point whereit enters the great ocean: it is not easy to count these and say there are somany grains of sand, or so many hundreds of grains, or so many thousands ofgrains, or so many hundreds of thousands of grains. Brahmin, the eons that haveelapsed and gone by are even more numerous than that. It is not easy to countthem and say that they are so many eons, or so many hundreds of eons, or so manythousands of eons, or so many hundreds of thousands of eons. For what reason?Because, brahmin, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning…. It isenough to be liberated from them.”(SN 15:8; II 183–84)(5) DOG ON A LEASH“Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is notdiscerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fetteredby craving.“There comes a time, monks, when the great ocean dries up and evaporates and nolonger exists, but still, I say, there is no making an end of suffering forthose beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered bycraving.“There comes a time, monks, when Sineru, the king of mountains, burns up andperishes and no longer exists, but still, I say, there is no making an end ofsuffering for those beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance andfettered by craving.“There comes a time, monks, when the great earth burns up and perishes and nolonger exists, but still, I say, there is no making an end of suffering forthose beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered bycraving.“Suppose, monks, a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillar:it would just keep on running and revolving around that same post or pillar. Sotoo, the uninstructed worldling regards form as self ... feeling as self ...perception as self ... volitional formations as self … consciousness as self….He just keeps running and revolving around form, around feeling, aroundperception, around volitional formations, around consciousness. As he keeps onrunning and revolving around them, he is not freed from form, not freed fromfeeling, not freed from perception, not freed from volitional formations, notfreed from consciousness. He is not freed from birth, aging, and death; notfreed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; not freed fromsuffering, I say.”(SN 22:99; II 149–50)"},{"pageContent":"II. The Bringer of Light007 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_007_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONThe picture of the human condition that emerges from the Nikāyas, as sketchedin the preceding chapter, is the background against which the manifestation ofthe Buddha in the world acquires a heightened and deepened significance. Unlesswe view the Buddha against this multi-dimensional background, extending from themost personal and individual exigencies of the present to the vast, impersonalrhythms of cosmic time, any interpretation we may arrive at about his role isbound to be incomplete. Far from capturing the viewpoint of the compilers of theNikāyas, our interpretation will be influenced as much by our ownpresuppositions as by theirs, perhaps even more so. Depending on our biases andpredispositions, we may choose to regard the Buddha as a liberal ethicalreformer of a degenerate Brahmanism, as a great secular humanist, as a radicalempiricist, as an existential psychologist, as the proponent of a sweepingagnosticism, or as the precursor of any other intellectual fashion that meetsour fancy. The Buddha who stares back at us from the texts will be too much areflection of ourselves, too little an image of the Enlightened One.Perhaps in interpreting a body of ancient religious literature we can neverfully avoid inserting ourselves and our own values into the subject we areinterpreting. However, though we may never achieve perfect transparency, we canlimit the impact of personal bias upon the process of interpretation by givingthe words of the texts due respect. When we pay this act of homage to theNikāyas, when we take seriously their own account of the background to theBuddha’s manifestation in the world, we will see that they ascribe to hismission nothing short of a cosmic scope. Against the background of a universewith no conceivable bounds in time, a universe within which living beingsenveloped in the darkness of ignorance wander along bound to the suffering ofold age, sickness, and death, the Buddha arrives as the “torchbearer ofhumankind” (ukkādhāro manussānaṃ) bringing the light of wisdom.1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en31] In the words of Text II,1,his arising in the world is “the manifestation of great vision, of great light,of great radiance.” Having discovered for himself the perfect peace ofliberation, he kindles for us the light of knowledge, which reveals both thetruths that we must see for ourselves and the path of practice that culminatesin this liberating vision.According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha Gotama is not merely one uniqueindividual who puts in an unprecedented appearance on the stage of human historyand then bows out forever. He is, rather, the fulfillment of a primordialarchetype, the most recent member of a cosmic “dynasty” of Buddhas constitutedby numberless Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past and sustained by PerfectlyEnlightened Ones continuing indefinitely onward into the future. Early Buddhism,even in the archaic root texts of the Nikāyas, already recognizes a pluralityof Buddhas who all conform to certain fixed patterns of behavior, the broadoutlines of which are described in the opening sections of the MahāpadānaSutta (Dīgha Nikāya 14, not represented in the present anthology). The word“Tathāgata,” which the texts use as an epithet for a Buddha, points to thisfulfillment of a primordial archetype. The word means both “the one who has comethus” (tath̄ ̄gata), that is, who has come into our midst in the same way thatthe Buddhas of the past have come; and “the one who has gone thus” (tath̄ gata),that is, who has gone to the ultimate peace, Nibbāna, in the same way that theBuddhas of the past have gone.Though the Nikāyas stipulate that in any given world system, at any given time,only one Perfectly Enlightened Buddha can arise, the arising of Buddhas isintrinsic to the cosmic process. Like a meteor against the blackness of thenight sky, from time to time a Buddha will appear against the backdrop ofboundless space and time, lighting up the spiritual firmament of the world,shedding the brilliance of his wisdom upon those capable of seeing the truthsthat he illuminates. The being who is to become a Buddha is called, in Pāli, abodhisatta, a word better known in the Sanskrit form, bodhisattva. According tocommon Buddhist tradition, a bodhisatta is one who undertakes a long course ofspiritual development consciously motivated by the aspiration to attain futureBuddhahood.2 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en32] Inspired andsustained by great compassion for living beings mired in the suffering of birthand death, a bodhisatta fulfills, over many eons of cosmic time, the difficultcourse needed to fully master the requisites for supreme enlightenment. When allthese requisites are complete, he attains Buddhahood in order to establish theDhamma in the world. A Buddha discovers the long-lost path to liberation, the“ancient path” traveled by the Buddhas of the past that culminates in theboundless freedom of Nibbāna. Having found the path and traveled it to its end,he then teaches it in all its fullness to humanity so that many others can enterthe way to final liberation.This, however, does not exhaust the function of a Buddha. A Buddha understandsand teaches not only the path leading to the supreme state of ultimateliberation, the perfect bliss of Nibbāna, but also the paths leading to thevarious types of wholesome mundane happiness to which human beings aspire. ABuddha proclaims both a path of mundane enhancement that enables sentient beingsto plant wholesome roots productive of happiness, peace, and security in theworldly dimensions of their lives, and a path of world-transcendence to guidesentient beings to Nibbāna. His role is thus much wider than an exclusive focuson the transcendent aspects of his teaching might suggest. He is not merely amentor of ascetics and contemplatives, not merely a teacher of meditationtechniques and philosophical insights, but a guide to the Dhamma in its fullrange and depth: one who reveals, proclaims, and establishes all the principlesintegral to correct understanding and wholesome conduct, whether mundane ortranscendental. Text II,1 highlights this wide-ranging altruistic dimension of aBuddha’s career when it praises the Buddha as the one person who arises in theworld “for the welfare of the multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, outof compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas andhumans.”The Nikāyas offer two perspectives on the Buddha as a person, and to do justiceto the texts it is important to hold these two perspectives in balance, withoutletting one cancel out the other. A correct view of the Buddha can only arisefrom the merging of these two perspectives, just as the correct view of anobject can arise only when the perspectives presented by our two eyes are mergedin the brain into a single image. One perspective, the one highlighted mostoften in modernist presentations of Buddhism, shows the Buddha as a human beingwho, like other human beings, had to struggle with the common frailties of humannature to arrive at the state of an Enlightened One. After his enlightenment atthe age of thirty-five, he walked among us for forty-five years as a wise andcompassionate human teacher, sharing his realization with others and ensuringthat his teachings would remain in the world long after his death. This is theside of the Buddha’s nature that figures most prominently in the Nikāyas. Sinceit corresponds closely with contemporary agnostic attitudes toward the ideals ofreligious faith, it has an immediate appeal to those nurtured by modern modes ofthought.The other aspect of the Buddha’s person is likely to seem strange to us, but itlooms large in Buddhist tradition and serves as the bedrock for popular Buddhistdevotion. Though secondary in the Nikāyas, it occasionally surfaces soconspicuously that it cannot be ignored, despite the efforts of Buddhistmodernists to downplay its significance or rationalize its intrusions. From thisperspective, the Buddha is seen as one who had already made preparations for hissupreme attainment over countless past lives and was destined from birth tofulfill the mission of a world teacher. Text II,2 is an example of how theBuddha is viewed from this perspective. Here, it is said, the future Buddhadescends fully conscious from the Tusita heaven into his mother’s womb; hisconception and birth are accompanied by wonders; deities worship the newborninfant; and as soon as he is born he walks seven steps and announces his futuredestiny. Obviously, for the compilers of such a sutta as this, the Buddha wasalready destined to attain Buddhahood even prior to his conception and thus hisstruggle for enlightenment was a battle whose outcome was already predetermined.The final paragraph of the sutta, however, ironically hearkens back to therealistic picture of the Buddha. What the Buddha himself considers to be trulywondrous are not the miracles accompanying his conception and birth, but hismindfulness and clear comprehension in the midst of feelings, thoughts, andperceptions.The three texts in section 3 are biographical accounts consistent with thisnaturalistic point of view. They offer us a portrait of the Buddha stark in itsrealism, bare in its naturalism, striking in its ability to convey deeppsychological insights with minimal descriptive technique. In Text II,3(1) weread about his renunciation, his training under two famous meditation teachers,his disillusionment with their teachings, his solitary struggle, and histriumphant realization of the Deathless. Text II,3(2) fills in the gaps of theabove narrative with a detailed account of the bodhisatta’s practice ofself-mortification, strangely missing from the previous discourse. This textalso gives us the classic description of the enlightenment experience asinvolving the attainment of the four jhānas, states of deep meditation,followed by the three vijjās or higher types of knowledge: the knowledge of therecollection of past lives, the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth ofbeings, and the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. While this text mayconvey the impression that the last knowledge broke upon the Buddha’s mind as asudden and spontaneous intuition, Text II,3(3) corrects this impression with anaccount of the Bodhisatta on the eve of his enlightenment reflecting deeply uponthe suffering of old age and death. He then methodically traces this sufferingback to its conditions by a process that involves, at each step, “carefulattention” (yoniso manasikāra) leading to “a breakthrough by wisdom” (paññāyaabhisamaya). This process of investigation culminates in the discovery ofdependent origination, which thereby becomes the philosophical cornerstone ofhis teaching.It is important to emphasize that, as presented here and elsewhere in theNikāyas (see below, pp. 353-59), dependent origination does not signify ajoyous celebration of the interconnectedness of all things but a precisearticulation of the conditional pattern in dependence upon which sufferingarises and ceases. In the same text, the Buddha declares that he discovered thepath to enlightenment only when he found the way to bring dependent originationto an end. It was thus the realization of the cessation of dependentorigination, and not merely the discovery of its origination aspect, thatprecipitated the Buddha’s enlightenment. The simile of the ancient city,introduced later in the discourse, illustrates the point that the Buddha’senlightenment was not a unique event but the rediscovery of the same “ancientpath” that had been followed by the Buddhas of the past.Text II,4 resumes the narrative of Text II,3(1), which I had divided by splicingin the two alternative versions of the bodhisatta’s quest for the path toenlightenment. We now rejoin the Buddha immediately after his enlightenment ashe ponders the weighty question whether to attempt to share his realization withthe world. Just at this point, in the midst of a text that has so far appearedso convincingly naturalistic, a deity named Brahmā Sahampati descends from theheavens to plead with the Buddha to wander forth and teach the Dhamma for thebenefit of those “with little dust in their eyes.” Should this scene beinterpreted literally or as a symbolic enactment of an internal drama takingplace in the Buddha’s mind? It is hard to give a definitive answer to thisquestion; perhaps the scene could be understood as occurring at both levels atonce. In any event, Brahmā’s appearance at this point marks a shift from therealism that colors the earlier part of the sutta back toward themythical-symbolic mode. The transition again underscores the cosmic significanceof the Buddha’s enlightenment and his future mission as a teacher.Brahmā’s appeal eventually prevails and the Buddha agrees to teach. He choosesas the first recipients of his teaching the five ascetics who had attended onhim during his years of ascetic practices. The narrative culminates in a briefstatement that the Buddha instructed them in such a way that they all attainedthe deathless Nibbāna for themselves. However, it gives no indication of thespecific teaching that the Buddha imparted to them when he first met them afterhis enlightenment. That teaching is the First Discourse itself, known as “TheSetting in Motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma.”This sutta is included here as Text II,5. When the sutta opens, the Buddhaannounces to the five ascetics that he has discovered “the middle way,” which heidentifies with the Noble Eightfold Path. In the light of the precedingbiographical account, we can understand why the Buddha should begin hisdiscourse in this way. The five ascetics had initially refused to acknowledgethe Buddha’s claim to enlightenment and spurned him as one who had betrayed thehigher calling to revert to a life of luxury. Thus he first had to assure themthat, far from reverting to a life of self-indulgence, he had discovered a newapproach to the timeless quest for enlightenment. This new approach, he toldthem, remains faithful to the renunciation of sensual pleasures yet eschewstormenting the body as pointless and unproductive. He then explained to them thetrue path to liberation, the Noble Eightfold Path, which avoids the two extremesand thereby gives rise to the light of wisdom and culminates in the destructionof all bondage, Nibbāna.Once he has cleared up their misunderstanding, the Buddha then proclaims thetruths he had realized on the night of his enlightenment. These are the FourNoble Truths. Not only does he enunciate each truth and briefly define itsmeaning, but he describes each truth from three perspectives. These constitutethe three “turnings of the wheel of the Dhamma” referred to later in thediscourse. With respect to each truth, the first turning is the wisdom thatilluminates the particular nature of that noble truth. The second turning is theunderstanding that each noble truth imposes a particular task to beaccomplished. Thus the first noble truth, the truth of suffering, is to be fullyunderstood; the second truth, the truth of suffering’s origin or craving, is tobe abandoned; the third truth, the truth of the cessation of suffering, is to berealized; and the fourth truth, the truth of the path, is to be developed. Thethird turning is the understanding that the four functions regarding the FourNoble Truths have been completed: the truth of suffering has been fullyunderstood; craving has been abandoned; the cessation of suffering has beenrealized; and the path has been fully developed. It was only when he understoodthe Four Noble Truths in these three turnings and twelve modes, he says, that hecould claim that he had attained unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta illustrates once again the blending of the twostylistic modes I referred to earlier. The discourse proceeds almost entirely inthe realistic-naturalistic mode until we approach the end. When the Buddhacompletes his sermon, the cosmic significance of the event is illuminated by apassage showing how the deities in each successive celestial realm applaud thediscourse and shout the good news up to the deities in the next higher realm. Atthe same time, the entire world system quakes and shakes, and a great lightsurpassing the radiance of the gods appears in the world. Then, at the very end,we return from this glorious scene back to the prosaic human realm, to beholdthe Buddha briefly congratulating the ascetic Koṇḍañña for gaining “thedust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma.” In one split-second, the Lamp of theDoctrine has passed from master to disciple, to begin its journey throughoutIndia and across the world.II. THE BRINGER OF LIGHT1. ONE PERSON“Monks, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of themultitude, for the happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world,for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. Who is that oneperson? It is the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Thisis that one person.“Monks, there is one person arising in the world who is unique, without a peer,without counterpart, incomparable, unequalled, matchless, unrivalled, the bestof humans. Who is that one person? It is the Tathāgata, the Arahant, thePerfectly Enlightened One. This is that one person.“Monks, the manifestation of one person is the manifestation of great vision, ofgreat light, of great radiance; it is the manifestation of the six thingsunsurpassed; the realization of the four analytical knowledges; the penetrationof the various elements, of the diversity of elements; it is the realization ofthe fruit of knowledge and liberation; the realization of the fruits ofstream-entry, once-returning, nonreturning, and arahantship.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en33] Who is that one person? Itis the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. This is that oneperson.”(AN 1: xiii, 1, 5, 6; I 22–23)2. THE BUDDHA’S CONCEPTION AND BIRTH1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Now a number of monks were sitting in the assembly hall, where they had mettogether on returning from their almsround, after their meal, when thisdiscussion arose among them: “It is wonderful, friends, it is marvelous, howmighty and powerful is the Tathāgata! For he is able to know about the Buddhasof the past—who attained final Nibbāna, cut [the tangle of] proliferation,broke the cycle, ended the round, and surmounted all suffering—that for thoseBlessed Ones their birth was thus, their names were thus, their clans were thus,their moral discipline was thus, their qualities [of concentration] were thus,their wisdom was thus, their meditative dwellings were thus, their liberationwas thus.”When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda told the monks: “Friends, Tathāgatasare wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathāgatas are marvelous and havemarvelous qualities.”4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en34]However, their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose frommeditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on aseat made ready. Then he addressed the monks thus: “Monks, for what discussionare you sitting together here now? And what was your discussion that wasinterrupted?”“Here, venerable sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had mettogether on returning from our almsround, after our meal, when this discussionarose among us: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is marvelous … their liberationwas thus.’ When this was said, venerable sir, the Venerable Ānanda said to us:‘Friends, Tathāgatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathāgatasare marvelous and have marvelous qualities.’ This was our discussion, venerablesir, that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived.”Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “That being so, Ānanda,explain more fully the Tathāgata’s wonderful and marvelous qualities.”3. “I heard and learned this, venerable sir, from the Blessed One’s own lips:‘Mindful and clearly comprehending, Ānanda, the Bodhisatta appeared in theTusita heaven.’5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en35] Thatmindful and clearly comprehending the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusitaheaven—this I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.4. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Mindful andclearly comprehending the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven.’ This too Iremember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.5. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘For the whole ofhis lifespan the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven.’ This too I rememberas a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.6. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Mindful andclearly comprehending the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven anddescended into his mother’s womb.’ This too I remember as a wonderful andmarvelous quality of the Blessed One.7. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mother’swomb, an immeasurable great radiance surpassing the divine majesty of the devasappeared in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this populationwith its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and human beings. And even inthose abysmal world intervals of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where themoon and the sun, mighty and powerful as they are, cannot make their lightprevail, there too an immeasurable great radiance surpassing the divine majestyof the devas appeared.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en36] Andthe beings reborn there perceived each other by that light: “So indeed, thereare also other beings reborn here.” And this ten-thousand-fold world systemshook, quaked, and trembled, and again an immeasurable great radiance surpassingthe divine majesty of the devas appeared in the world.’ This too I remember as awonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.8. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, four young devas came to guardhim at the four quarters so that no humans or nonhumans or anyone at all couldharm the Bodhisatta or his mother.’7[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en37] This too I remember as awonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.9. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, she became intrinsicallyvirtuous, refraining from killing living beings, from taking what is not given,from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from wines, liquors, andintoxicants, the basis of negligence.’ This too I remember as a wonderful andmarvelous quality of the Blessed One.…14. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Other women givebirth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months, but not sothe Bodhisatta’s mother. The Bodhisatta’s mother gave birth to him aftercarrying him in her womb for exactly ten months.’ This too I remember as awonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.15. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Other women givebirth seated or lying down, but not so the Bodhisatta’s mother. The Bodhisatta’smother gave birth to him standing up.’ This too I remember as a wonderful andmarvelous quality of the Blessed One.16. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, first devas received him, thenhuman beings.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of theBlessed One.17. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, he did not touch the earth. Thefour young devas received him and set him before his mother saying: “Rejoice, Oqueen, a son of great power has been born to you.”’ This too I remember as awonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.18. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, he came forth unsullied, unsmearedby water, humors, blood, or any kind of impurity, clean and unsullied. Supposethere were a gem placed on fine cloth, then the gem would not smear the cloth orthe cloth the gem. Why is that? Because of the purity of both. So too when theBodhisatta came forth … he came forth clean and unsullied.’ This too I rememberas a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.19. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, two jets of water appeared to pourfrom the sky, one cool and one warm, for bathing the Bodhisatta and his mother.’This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.20. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘As soon as theBodhisatta was born, he stood firmly with his feet on the ground; then he tookseven steps facing north, and with a white parasol held over him, he surveyedeach quarter and uttered the words of the leader of the herd: “I am the highestin the world; I am the best in the world; I am the foremost in the world. Thisis my last birth; now there is no renewed existence for me.”’8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en38] This too I remember as awonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.21. “I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, an immeasurable great radiancesurpassing the divine majesty of the devas appeared in the world with its devas,Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, with itsdevas and human beings. And even in those abysmal world intervals of vacancy,gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and the sun, mighty and powerful asthey are, cannot make their light prevail—there too an immeasurable greatradiance surpassing the divine majesty of the devas appeared in the world. Andthe beings reborn there perceived each other by that light: “So indeed, thereare also other beings reborn here.” And this ten-thousand-fold world systemshook, quaked, and trembled, and there too an immeasurable great radiancesurpassing the divine majesty of the devas appeared in the world.’ That when theBodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, an immeasurable great radiancesurpassing the divine majesty of the devas appeared in the world ... this too Iremember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Blessed One.”22. “That being so, Ānanda, remember this too as a wonderful and marvelousquality of the Tathāgata: Here, Ānanda, for the Tathāgata feelings are knownas they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are known asthey arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as theyarise, as they are present, as they disappear.9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en39] Remember this too, Ānanda,as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the Tathāgata.”23. “Venerable sir, since for the Blessed One feelings are known as they arise,as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, asthey are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as theyare present, as they disappear—this too I remember as a wonderful and marvelousquality of the Blessed One.”That is what the Venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher approved. The monks weresatisfied and delighted in the Venerable Ānanda’s words.(MN 123: Acchariya-abbhūta Sutta, abridged; III 118–20; 122–24)3. THE QUEST FOR ENLIGHTENMENT(1) SEEKING THE SUPREME STATE OF SUBLIME PEACE5. “Monks, there are these two kinds of search: the noble search and the ignoblesearch. And what is the ignoble search? Here someone being himself subject tobirth seeks what is also subject to birth; being himself subject to aging, heseeks what is also subject to aging; being himself subject to sickness, he seekswhat is also subject to sickness; being himself subject to death, he seeks whatis also subject to death; being himself subject to sorrow, he seeks what is alsosubject to sorrow; being himself subject to defilement, he seeks what is alsosubject to defilement.6–11. “And what may be said to be subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death;to sorrow and defilement? Wife and children, men and women slaves, goats andsheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and silver:these acquisitions are subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death; to sorrowand defilement; and one who is tied to these things, infatuated with them, andutterly absorbed in them, being himself subject to birth ... to sorrow anddefilement, seeks what it also subject to birth ... to sorrow and defilement.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en40]12. “And what is the noble search? Here someone being himself subject to birth,having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, seeks the unbornsupreme security from bondage, Nibbāna; being himself subject to aging, havingunderstood the danger in what is subject to aging, he seeks the unaging supremesecurity from bondage, Nibbāna; being himself subject to sickness, havingunderstood the danger in what is subject to sickness, he seeks the unailingsupreme security from bondage, Nibbāna; being himself subject to death, havingunderstood the danger in what is subject to death, he seeks the deathlesssupreme security from bondage, Nibbāna; being himself subject to sorrow, havingunderstood the danger in what is subject to sorrow, he seeks the sorrowlesssupreme security from bondage, Nibbāna; being himself subject to defilement,having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, he seeks theundefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbāna. This is the noble search.13. “Monks, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightenedbodhisatta, I too, being myself subject to birth, sought what was also subjectto birth; being myself subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, anddefilement, I sought what was also subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow,and defilement. Then I considered thus: ‘Why, being myself subject to birth, doI seek what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to aging,sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject toaging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose that, being myselfsubject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, Iseek the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibbāna. Suppose that, beingmyself subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, havingunderstood the danger in what is subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, anddefilement, I seek the unaging, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and undefiledsupreme security from bondage, Nibbāna.’14. “Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with theblessing of youth, in the prime of life, though my mother and father wishedotherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my hair and beard, put onthe ochre robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.15. “Having gone forth, monks, in search of what is wholesome, seeking thesupreme state of sublime peace, I went to Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him:‘Friend Kālāma, I want to lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma andDiscipline.’ Āḷāra Kālāma replied: ‘The venerable one may stay here. ThisDhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and dwell in it, realizingfor himself through direct knowledge his own teacher’s doctrine.’ I soon quicklylearned that Dhamma. As far as mere lip-reciting and rehearsal of his teachingwent, I could speak with knowledge and assurance, and I claimed, ‘I know andsee’—and there were others who did likewise.“I considered: ‘It is not through mere faith alone that Āḷāra Kālāmadeclares: “By realizing it for myself with direct knowledge, I enter upon anddwell in this Dhamma.” Certainly Āḷāra Kālāma dwells knowing and seeingthis Dhamma.’ Then I went to Āḷāra Kālāma and asked him: ‘Friend Kālāma,in what way do you declare that by realizing it for yourself with directknowledge you enter upon and dwell in this Dhamma?’ In reply he declared thebase of nothingness.11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en41]“I considered: ‘Not only Āḷāra Kālāma has faith, energy, mindfulness,concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration,and wisdom. Suppose I endeavor to realize the Dhamma that Āḷāra Kālāmadeclares he enters upon and dwells in by realizing it for himself with directknowledge?’“I soon quickly entered upon and dwelled in that Dhamma by realizing it formyself with direct knowledge. Then I went to Āḷāra Kālāma and asked him:‘Friend Kālāma, is it in this way that you declare that you enter upon anddwell in this Dhamma by realizing it for yourself with direct knowledge?’—‘Thatis the way, friend.’—‘It is in this way, friend, that I also enter upon anddwell in this Dhamma by realizing it for myself with direct knowledge.’—‘It is again for us, friend, it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable onefor our fellow monk. So the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and dwell in byrealizing it for myself with direct knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter uponand dwell in by realizing it for yourself with direct knowledge. And the Dhammathat you enter upon and dwell in by realizing it for yourself with directknowledge is the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and dwell in by realizing itfor myself with direct knowledge. So you know the Dhamma that I know and I knowthe Dhamma that you know. As I am, so are you; as you are, so am I. Come,friend, let us now lead this community together.’“Thus Āḷāra Kālāma, my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on an equal footingwith himself and awarded me the highest honor. But it occurred to me: ‘ThisDhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace,to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna, but only to rebirth in thebase of nothingness.’12 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en42] Notbeing satisfied with that Dhamma, disappointed with it, I left.16. “Still in search, monks, of what is wholesome, seeking the supreme state ofsublime peace, I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said to him: ‘Friend, I want tolead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and Discipline.’ Uddaka Rāmaputtareplied: ‘The venerable one may stay here.

There I saw an agreeablepiece of ground, a delightful grove with a clear-flowing river with pleasant,smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort. I considered: ‘This is anagreeable piece of ground, this is a delightful grove with a clear-flowing riverwith pleasant, smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort.

Here, Aggivessana, before my enlightenment, while Iwas still only an unenlightened bodhisatta, I thought: ‘Household life iscrowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living ina home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robe, and go forth fromthe home life into homelessness.’ 13–16. “Later, while still young, ablack-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life...

Could the man light a fire and produce heat bytaking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of woodlying in the water?”“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, and it islying in water. Eventually the man would reap only weariness anddisappointment.”“So too, Aggivessana, as to those ascetics and brahmins who still do not livebodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection,infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fullyabandoned and suppressed internally, even if those good ascetics and brahminsfeel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable ofknowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good asceticsand brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion,they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment. This wasthe first simile that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.18. “Again, Aggivessana, a second simile occurred to me spontaneously, neverheard before. Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land farfrom water, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light afire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man lighta fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it againstthe wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from water?”“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, eventhough it is lying on dry land far from water.

These are the threesimiles that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.20. “I thought: ‘Suppose, with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed againstthe roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrain, and crush mind with mind.’ So,with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, Ibeat down, constrained, and crushed mind with mind. While I did so, sweat ranfrom my armpits. Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head orshoulders and beat him down, constrain him, and crush him, so too, with my teethclenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I beat down,constrained, and crushed mind with mind, and sweat ran from my armpits. Butalthough tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness wasestablished, my body was overwrought and strained because I was exhausted by thepainful striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade mymind and remain.17 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en47]21. “I thought: ‘Suppose I practice the breathless meditation.’ So I stopped thein-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth and nose. While I did so, there wasa loud sound of winds coming out from my ear holes. Just as there is a loudsound when a smith’s bellows are blown, so too, while I stopped the in-breathsand out-breaths through my nose and ears, there was a loud sound of winds comingout from my ear holes. But although tireless energy was aroused in me andunremitting mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and strainedbecause I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such painful feeling thatarose in me did not invade my mind and remain.22. “I thought: ‘Suppose I practice further the breathless meditation.’ So Istopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears. While Idid so, violent winds cut through my head. Just as if a strong man were pressingagainst my head with the tip of a sharp sword, so too, while I stopped thein-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears, violent winds cutthrough my head. But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremittingmindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and strained because I wasexhausted by the painful striving.

While Idid so, there were violent pains in my head. Just as if a strong man weretightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband, so too, while Istopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears, therewere violent pains in my head. But although tireless energy was aroused in meand unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought andstrained because I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such painfulfeeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.24. “I thought: ‘Suppose I practice further the breathless meditation.’ So Istopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears. While Idid so, violent winds carved up my belly. Just as if a skilled butcher or hisapprentice were to carve up an ox’s belly with a sharp butcher’s knife, so too,while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears,violent winds carved up my belly.

Ifyou do so, we shall infuse heavenly food into the pores of your skin and thiswill sustain you.’ I considered: ‘If I claim to be completely fasting whilethese deities infuse heavenly food into the pores of my skin and this sustainsme, then I shall be lying.’ So I dismissed those deities, saying: ‘There is noneed.’28. “I thought: ‘Suppose I take very little food, a handful each time, whetherof bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup.’ So I took very littlefood, a handful each time, whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup orpea soup. While I did so, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Becauseof eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems orbamboo stems. Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel’shoof. Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth likecorded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as thecrazy rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating so little the gleam ofmy eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like the gleam of water that hassunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so little my scalp shriveled andwithered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun.Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if Itouched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone Iencountered my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I defecated orurinated, I fell over on my face there. Because of eating so little, if I triedto ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at itsroots, fell from my body as I rubbed.29. “Now when people saw me, some said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’ Otherpeople said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is not black; he is brown.’ Other people said:‘The ascetic Gotama is neither black nor brown; he is golden-skinned.’ So muchhad the clear, bright color of my skin deteriorated through eating so little.30. “I thought: ‘Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past have experiencedpainful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this is the utmost; thereis none beyond this. And whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future willexperience painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this is theutmost; there is none beyond this. And whatever ascetics and brahmins at presentexperience painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this is theutmost; there is none beyond this. But by this racking practice of austerities Ihave not attained any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy ofthe noble ones. Could there be another path to enlightenment?’31. “I considered: ‘I recall that when my father the Sakyan was occupied, whileI was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, secluded from sensualpleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the firstjhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture andhappiness born of seclusion.18[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en48] Could this be the path toenlightenment?’ Then, following on that memory, came the realization: ‘This isindeed the path to enlightenment.’32. “I thought: ‘Why am I afraid of that happiness that has nothing to do withsensual pleasures and unwholesome states?’ I thought: ‘I am not afraid of thathappiness that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states.’33. “I considered: ‘It is not easy to attain that happiness with a body soexcessively emaciated. Suppose I ate some solid food—some boiled rice andporridge.’ And I ate some solid food—some boiled rice and porridge. Now at thattime five monks were waiting upon me, thinking: ‘If our ascetic Gotama achievessome higher state, he will inform us.’ But when I ate the boiled rice andporridge, the five monks were disgusted and left me, thinking: ‘The asceticGotama now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted toluxury.’34. “Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then secludedfrom sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelledin the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, withrapture and happiness born of seclusion. But such pleasant feeling that arose inme did not invade my mind and remain.19[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en49]35. “With the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelled in thesecond jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is withoutthought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.36. “With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwelled equanimous, and mindfuland clearly comprehending, I experienced happiness with the body; I entered anddwelled in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous,mindful, one who dwells happily.’ But such pleasant feeling that arose in me didnot invade my mind and remain.37. “With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passingaway of joy and displeasure, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna, whichis neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness byequanimity. But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mindand remain.38. “When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofimperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, Idirected it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. I recollected mymanifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births,five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fiftybirths, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, manyeons of world-contraction, many eons of world-expansion, many eons ofworld-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, withsuch an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure andpain, such my lifespan; and passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; andthere too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was mynutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my lifespan; andpassing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus with their aspects andparticulars I recollected my manifold past lives.39. “This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of thenight. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, darkness was banishedand light arose, as happens in one who dwells diligent, ardent, and resolute.But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.40. “When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofimperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, Idirected it to knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With thedivine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing awayand being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate andunfortunate, and I understood how beings fare on according to their actionsthus: ‘These beings who behaved wrongly by body, speech, and mind, who reviledthe noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions based on wrong view, withthe breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, ina bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who behavedwell by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who heldright view, and undertook action based on right view, with the breakup of thebody, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I sawbeings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly,fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare on according totheir actions.41. “This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch ofthe night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, darkness wasbanished and light arose, as happens in one who dwells diligent, ardent, andresolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind andremain.42. “When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofimperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, Idirected it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I directly knew as itactually is: ‘This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is thecessation of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’I directly knew as it actually is: ‘These are the taints. This is the origin ofthe taints. This is the cessation of the taints. This is the way leading to thecessation of the taints.’43. “When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensualdesire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When itwas liberated, there came the knowledge: ‘It is liberated. ’ I directly knew:‘Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done hasbeen done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’44. “This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of thenight. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, darkness was banishedand light arose, as happens in one who dwells diligent, ardent, and resolute.But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.”(from MN 36: Mahāsaccaka Sutta; I 240–49)(3) THE ANCIENT CITY“Monks, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fullyenlightened, it occurred to me: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, inthat it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does notunderstand the escape from this suffering headed by aging-and-death.

He would follow it and wouldsee an ancient city, an ancient capital that had been inhabited by people in thepast, with parks, groves, ponds, and ramparts, a delightful place. Then the manwould inform the king or a royal minister: ‘Sire, know that while wanderingthrough the forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient road traveled upon bypeople in the past. I followed it and saw an ancient city, an ancient capitalthat had been inhabited by people in the past, with parks, groves, ponds, andramparts, a delightful place. Renovate that city, sire!’ Then the king or theroyal minister would renovate the city, and some time later that city wouldbecome successful and prosperous, well populated, filled with people, attainedto growth and expansion.“So too, monks, I saw the ancient path, the ancient road traveled by thePerfectly Enlightened Ones of the past. And what is that ancient path, thatancient road? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, rightintention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, rightmindfulness, right concentration. I followed that path and by doing so I havedirectly known aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leadingto its cessation. I have directly known birth ... existence ... clinging ...craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form ...consciousness ... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and theway leading to their cessation.23[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en53] Having directly known them,I have explained them to the monks, the nuns, the male lay followers, and thefemale lay followers. This spiritual life, monks, has become successful andprosperous, extended, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas andhumans.”(SN 12:65; II 104–7)4. THE DECISION TO TEACH19. “I considered: ‘This Dhamma that I have attained is profound, hard to seeand hard to understand, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning,subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this population delights inattachment, takes delight in attachment, rejoices in attachment.24[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en54] It is hard for such apopulation to see this truth, namely, specific conditionality, dependentorigination. And it is hard to see this truth, namely, the stilling of allformations, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving,dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.25[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en55] If I were to teach theDhamma, others would not understand me, and that would be wearying andtroublesome for me.’ Thereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzasnever heard before:Enough with teaching the DhammaThat even I found hard to reach;For it will never be perceivedBy those who live in lust and hate. Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darknessWill never discern this abstruse Dhamma,Which goes against the worldly stream,Subtle, deep, and difficult to see.“Considering thus, my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching theDhamma.26 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en56]20. “Then, monks, the Brahmā Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in mymind and he considered: ‘The world will be lost, the world will perish, sincethe mind of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, inclinesto inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.’ Then, just as quickly as astrong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the BrahmāSahampati vanished in the brahma world and appeared before me. He arranged hisupper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutationtoward me, said: ‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let theSublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyeswho are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who willunderstand the Dhamma.’ The Brahmā Sahampati spoke thus, and then he saidfurther:‘In Magadha there have appeared till nowImpure teachings devised by those still stained.‘Open the doors to the Deathless! Let them hearThe Dhamma that the stainless one has found. ‘Just as one who stands on a mountain peakCan see below the people all around,So, O wise one, all-seeing sage,Ascend the palace of the Dhamma.Let the sorrowless one survey this human breed,Engulfed in sorrow, overcome by birth and old age. ‘Arise, victorious hero, caravan leader,Debtless one, and wander in the world.Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma,There will be those who will understand.’21. “Then I listened to the Brahmā’s pleading, and out of compassion for beingsI surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. Surveying the world with the eyeof a Buddha, I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust intheir eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities andwith bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach, and some who dwelled seeingfear and blame in the other world. Just as in a pond of blue or red or whitelotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in thewater without rising out of it, and some other lotuses that are born and grow inthe water rest on the water’s surface, and some other lotuses that are born andgrow in the water rise out of the water and stand clear, unwetted by it; so too,surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha, I saw beings with little dust intheir eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and with dullfaculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard toteach, and some who dwelled seeing fear and blame in the other world. Then Ireplied to the Brahmā Sahampati in stanzas:‘Open for them are the doors to the Deathless,Let those with ears now show their faith.Thinking it would be troublesome, O Brahmā,I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime.’“Then the Brahmā Sahampati thought: ‘The Blessed One has consented to myrequest that he teach the Dhamma.’ And after paying homage to me, keeping me onthe right, he thereupon departed at once.22. “I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who willunderstand this Dhamma quickly?’ It then occurred to me: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma iswise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long had little dust in his eyes.Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to Āḷāra Kālāma. He will understand itquickly.’ Then deities approached me and said: ‘Venerable sir, Āḷāra Kālāmadied seven days ago.’ And the knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘ĀḷāraKālāma died seven days ago.’ I thought: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma’s loss is a greatone. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.’23. “I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who willunderstand this Dhamma quickly?’ It then occurred to me: ‘Uddaka Rāmaputta iswise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long had little dust in his eyes.Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to Uddaka Rāmaputta. He will understand itquickly.’ Then deities approached me and said: ‘Venerable sir, Uddaka Rāmaputtadied last night.’ And the knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Uddaka Rāmaputtadied last night.’ I thought: ‘Uddaka Rāmaputta’s loss is a great one. If he hadheard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.’24. “I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who willunderstand this Dhamma quickly?’ It then occurred to me: ‘The monks of the groupof five who attended upon me while I was engaged in my striving were veryhelpful.27 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en57] Suppose I taughtthe Dhamma first to them.’ Then I thought: ‘Where are the monks of the group offive now living?’ And with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses thehuman, I saw that they were living at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park atIsipatana.25. “Then, monks, when I had stayed at Uruvelā as long as I chose, I set out towander by stages to Bārāṇasī. Between Gayā and the Bodhi, the ĀjīvakaUpaka saw me on the road and said: ‘Friend, your faculties are clear, the colorof your skin is pure and bright. Under whom have you gone forth, friend? Who isyour teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?’ I replied to the Ājīvaka Upaka instanzas:‘I am one who has transcended all, a knower of all,Unsullied among all things, renouncing all,By craving’s ceasing freed. Having known this allFor myself, to whom should I point as teacher? ‘I have no teacher, and one like meExists nowhere in all the worldWith all its devas, because I haveNo person for my counterpart. ‘For I am the arahant in the world,I am the teacher supreme.I alone am a Perfectly Enlightened OneWhose fires are quenched and extinguished. ‘I go now to the city of KāsiTo set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.In a world that has become blindI go to beat the drum of the Deathless.’‘By your claims, friend, you ought to be the universal victor.’28[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en58]‘The victors are those like meWho have won the destruction of taints.I have vanquished all evil states,Therefore, Upaka, I am a victor.’“When this was said, the Ājīvaka Upaka said: ‘May it be so, friend.’ Shakinghis head, he took a bypath and departed.26. “Then, monks, wandering by stages, I eventually came to Bārāṇasī, to theDeer Park at Isipatana, and I approached the monks of the group of five. Themonks saw me coming in the distance, and they agreed among themselves thus:‘Friends, here comes the ascetic Gotama who lives luxuriously, who gave up hisstriving and reverted to luxury. We should not pay homage to him or rise up forhim or receive his bowl and outer robe. But a seat may be prepared for him. Ifhe likes, he may sit down.’ However, as I approached, those monks foundthemselves unable to keep their pact. One came to meet me and took my bowl andouter robe, another prepared a seat, and another set out water for my feet;however, they addressed me by name and as ‘friend.’29[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en59]27. “Thereupon I told them: ‘Monks, do not address the Tathāgata by name and as“friend.” The Tathāgata is an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. Listen,monks, the Deathless has been attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach youthe Dhamma. Practicing as you are instructed, by realizing it for yourselveshere and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter and dwell in thatsupreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forthfrom the home life into homelessness.’“When this was said, the monks of the group of five answered me thus: ‘FriendGotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance of austerities thatyou undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge andvision worthy of the noble ones. Since you now live luxuriously, having given upyour striving and reverted to luxury, how could you have achieved any superhumandistinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?’ When this wassaid, I told them: ‘The Tathāgata does not live luxuriously, nor has he givenup his striving and reverted to luxury. The Tathāgata is an Arahant, aPerfectly Enlightened One. Listen, monks, the Deathless has been attained … fromthe home life into homelessness.’“A second time the monks of the group of five said to me: ‘Friend Gotama … howcould you have achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and visionworthy of the noble ones?’ A second time I told them: ‘The Tathāgata does notlive luxuriously … from the home life into homelessness.’ A third time the monksof the group of five said to me: ‘Friend Gotama … how could you have achievedany superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?’28. “When this was said I asked them: ‘Monks, have you ever known me to speaklike this before?’—‘No, venerable sir.’30[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en60]—‘Monks, the Tathāgata is anArahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. Listen, monks, the Deathless has beenattained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. Practicing as youare instructed, by realizing it for yourselves here and now through directknowledge, you will soon enter and dwell in that supreme goal of the holy lifefor the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life intohomelessness.’29. “I was able to convince the monks of the group of five.31[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en61] Then I sometimes instructedtwo monks while the other three went for alms, and the six of us lived on whatthose three monks brought back from their almsround. Sometimes I instructedthree monks while the other two went for alms, and the six of us lived on whatthose two monks brought back from their almsround.30. “Then the monks of the group of five, thus taught and instructed by me,being themselves subject to birth, having understood the danger in what issubject to birth, seeking the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibbāna,attained the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibbāna; being themselvessubject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, having understood thedanger in what is subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement,seeking the unaging, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and undefiled supremesecurity from bondage, Nibbāna, they attained the unaging, unailing, deathless,sorrowless, and undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbāna. The knowledgeand vision arose in them: ‘Our liberation is unshakable; this is our last birth;now there is no more renewed existence.’”(from MN 26: Ariyapariyesana Sutta; I 167–73)5. THE FIRST DISCOURSEThus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasīin the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the monks of thegroup of five thus:“Monks, these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth intohomelessness. What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures,which is low, vulgar, the way of worldlings, ignoble, unbeneficial; and thepursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, unbeneficial. Withoutveering toward either of these extremes, the Tathāgata has awakened to themiddle way, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, and leadsto peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.“And what, monks, is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata? It is thisNoble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, rightaction, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.This, monks, is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata, which gives riseto vision, which gives rise to knowledge, and leads to peace, to directknowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.“Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging issuffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what isdispleasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not toget what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject toclinging are suffering.“Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is thiscraving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust,seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, cravingfor existence, craving for extermination.“Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is theremainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up andrelinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonattachment.“Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation ofsuffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... rightconcentration.“‘This is the noble truth of suffering’: thus, monks, in regard to thingsunheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, penetration, andlight.32 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en62]“‘This noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood’: thus, monks, inregard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom,penetration, and light.33 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en63]“‘This noble truth of suffering has been fully understood’: thus, monks, inregard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom,penetration, and light.34 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en64]“‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering’: thus, monks, in regard tothings unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, penetration,and light.“‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be abandoned’: thus, monks,in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom,penetration, and light.“‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been abandoned’: thus, monks,in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom,penetration, and light.“‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering’: thus, monks, in regardto things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom,penetration, and light.“‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be realized’: thus,monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge,wisdom, penetration, and light.“‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized’: thus,monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge,wisdom, penetration, and light.“‘This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering’:thus, monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me vision,knowledge, wisdom, penetration, and light.“‘This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to bedeveloped’: thus, monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in mevision, knowledge, wisdom, penetration, and light.“‘This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has beendeveloped’: thus, monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in mevision, knowledge, wisdom, penetration, and light.“So long, monks, as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as theyreally are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purifiedin this way,35 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en65] I did notclaim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this worldwith its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics andbrahmins, its devas and humans. But when my knowledge and vision of these FourNoble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects wasthoroughly purified in this way, then I claimed to have awakened to theunsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, andBrahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas andhumans. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is the liberation ofmy mind. This is my last birth. Now there is no more renewed existence.’”This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, the monks of the group of fivedelighted in the Blessed One’s statement. And while this discourse was beingspoken, there arose in the Venerable Koṇḍañña the dust-free, stainless visionof the Dhamma: “Whatever is subject to origination is all subject tocessation.”36 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en66]And when the wheel of the Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One, theearth-dwelling devas raised a cry: “At Bārāṇasī, in the Deer Park atIsipatana, this unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by theBlessed One, which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māraor Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” Having heard the cry of theearth-dwelling devas, the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings raised acry: “At Bārāṇasī … this unsurpassed wheel of the Dhamma has been set inmotion by the Blessed One, which cannot be stopped ... by anyone in the world.”Having heard the cry of the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings, theTāvatiṃsa devas … the Yāma devas … the Tusita devas … the devas who delightin creating … the devas who wield power over others’ creations … the devas ofBrahmā’s company37 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_002.html#en67] raised acry: “At Bārāṇasī, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, this unsurpassed wheel ofthe Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, which cannot be stopped byany ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”Thus at that moment, at that instant, at that second, the cry spread as far asthe brahma world, and this ten-thousand-fold world system shook, quaked, andtrembled, and an immeasurable great radiance surpassing the divine majesty ofthe devas appeared in the world.Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance: “Koṇḍañña has indeedunderstood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!” In this way the VenerableKoṇḍañña acquired the name “Aññā Koṇḍañña—Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood.”(SN 56:11: Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta; V 420–24)"},{"pageContent":"III. Approaching the Dhamma008 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_008_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONOne of the most distressing predicaments any earnest, open-minded spiritualseeker might face is the sheer difficulty of choosing from among the bewilderingdiversity of religious and spiritual teachings available. By their very nature,spiritual teachings make claims upon our allegiance that are absolute andall-encompassing. Adherents of a particular creed are prone to assert that theirreligion alone reveals the final truth about our place in the universe and ourultimate destiny; they boldly propose that their path alone offers the suremeans to eternal salvation. If we could suspend all belief commitments andcompare the competing doctrines impartially, submitting them to empirical tests,we would have a sure-fire method of deciding between them, and then our ordealwould be over. But it isn’t that simple. Rival religions all propose—orpresuppose—doctrines that we cannot directly validate by personal experience;they advocate tenets that call for some degree of trust. So, as their tenets andpractices clash, we run up against the problem of finding some way to decidebetween them and negotiate their competing claims to truth.One solution to this problem is to deny that there is any real conflict betweenalternative belief systems. The adherents of this approach, which we might callreligious universalism, say that at their core all spiritual traditions teachessentially the same thing. Their formulations may differ but their inner coreis the same, expressed differently merely to accord with differentsensibilities. What we need to do, the universalist says, when faced withdifferent spiritual traditions, is to extract the kernel of inner truth from thepods of their exoteric creeds. From ground level our goals look different, butfrom the heights we will find the goal is the same; it is like the view of themoon from different mountain peaks. Universalists in matters of doctrine oftenendorse eclecticism in practice, holding that we can select whatever practiceswe prefer and combine them like dishes at a buffet.This solution to the problem of religious diversity has an immediate appeal tothose disillusioned with the exclusive claims of dogmatic religion. Honestcritical reflection, however, would show that on the most vital issues thedifferent religions and spiritual traditions take different standpoints. Theygive us very different answers to our questions concerning the basic grounds andgoals of the spiritual quest and often these differences are not merely verbal.To sweep them away as being merely verbal may be an effective way of achievingharmony between followers of different belief systems, but it cannot withstandclose examination. In the end, it is as little tenable as saying that, becausethey have beaks and wings, eagles, sparrows, and chickens are essentially thesame type of creature, the differences between them being merely verbal.It is not only theistic religions that teach doctrines beyond the range ofimmediate empirical confirmation. The Buddha too taught doctrines that anordinary person cannot directly confirm by everyday experience, and thesedoctrines are fundamental to the structure of his teaching. We saw, for example,in the introductions to chapters I and II, that the Nikāyas envisage a universewith many domains of sentient existence spread out in boundless space and time,a universe in which sentient beings roam and wander from life to life on accountof their ignorance, craving, and kamma. The Nikāyas presuppose that throughoutbeginningless time, Buddhas without number have arisen and turned the wheel ofthe Dhamma, and that each Buddha attains enlightenment after cultivatingspiritual perfections over long periods of cosmic time. When we approach theDhamma we are likely to resist such beliefs and feel that they make excessivedemands on our capacity for trust. Thus we inevitably run up against thequestion whether, if we wish to follow the Buddha’s teaching, we must take onboard the entire package of classical Buddhist doctrine.For Early Buddhism, all the problems we face in deciding how far we should go inplacing faith can be disposed of at a single stroke. That single stroke involvesreverting to direct experience as the ultimate basis for judgment. One of thedistinctive features of the Buddha’s teaching is the respect it accords todirect experience. The texts of Early Buddhism do not teach a secret doctrine,nor do they leave scope for anything like an esoteric path reserved for an éliteof initiates and withheld from others. According to Text III,1, secrecy in areligious teaching is the hallmark of wrong views and confused thinking. Theteaching of the Buddha shines openly, as radiant and brilliant as the light ofthe sun and moon. Freedom from the cloak of secrecy is integral to a teachingthat gives primacy to direct experience, inviting each individual to test itsprinciples in the crucible of his or her own experience.This does not mean that an ordinary person can fully validate the Buddha’sdoctrine by direct experience without special effort. To the contrary, theteaching can only be fully realized through the achievement of certainextraordinary types of experience that are far beyond the range of the ordinaryperson enmeshed in the concerns of mundane life. However, in sharp contrast torevealed religion, the Buddha does not demand that we begin our spiritual questby placing faith in doctrines that lie beyond the range of our immediateexperience. Rather than ask us to wrestle with issues that, for us in ourpresent condition , no amount of experience can decide, he instead asks us toconsider a few simple questions pertaining to our immediate welfare andhappiness, questions that we can answer on the basis of personal experience. Ihighlight the expression “for us in our present condition,” because the factthat we cannot presently validate such matters does not constitute grounds forrejecting them as invalid or even as irrelevant. It only means that we shouldput them aside for the time being and concern ourselves with issues that comewithin the range of direct experience.The Buddha says that his teaching is about suffering and the cessation ofsuffering. This statement does not mean that the Dhamma is concerned only withour experience of suffering in the present life, but it does imply that we canuse our present experience, backed by intelligent observation, as a criterionfor determining what is beneficial and what detrimental to our spiritualprogress. Our most insistent existential demand, springing up deep within us, isthe need for freedom from harm, sorrow, and distress; or, positively stated, theneed to achieve well-being and happiness. However, to avoid harm and to secureour well-being, it is not sufficient for us merely to hope. We first have tounderstand the conditions on which they depend. According to the Buddha,whatever arises, arises through appropriate causes and conditions, and thisapplies with equal force to suffering and happiness. Thus we must ascertain thecauses and conditions that lead to harm and suffering, and likewise the causesand conditions that lead to well-being and happiness. Once we have extractedthese two principles— the conditions leading to harm and suffering, and theconditions leading to well-being and happiness—we have at our disposal anoutline of the entire process that leads to the ultimate goal, final liberationfrom suffering.One text offering an excellent example of this approach is a short discourse inthe Aṅguttara Nikāya popularly known as the Kālāma Sutta, included as TextIII,2. The Kālāmas were a people living in a remote area of the Ganges plain.Various religious teachers would come to visit them and each would extol his owndoctrine and tear down the doctrines of his rivals. Confused and perplexed bythis conflict of belief systems, the Kālāmas did not know whom to trust. Whenthe Buddha passed through their town, they approached him and asked him to clearaway their doubts. Though the text does not specify what particular issues weretroubling the Kālāmas, the later part of the discourse makes it clear thattheir perplexities revolved around the questions of rebirth and kamma.The Buddha began by assuring the Kālāmas that under such circumstances it wasproper for them to doubt, for the issues that troubled them were indeed commonsources of doubt and perplexity. He then told them not to rely on ten sources ofbelief. Four of these pertain to established scriptural authority (oraltradition, lineage of teaching, hearsay, and collections of texts); four torational grounds (logic, inferential reasoning, reasoned cogitation, and theacceptance of a view after pondering it); and two to authoritative persons(impressive speakers and respected teachers). This advice is sometimes quoted toprove that the Buddha rejected all external authorities and invited eachindividual to fashion his or her own personal path to truth. Read in context,however, the message of the Kālāma Sutta is quite different. The Buddha is notadvising the Kālāmas—who, it must be stressed, had at this point not yetbecome his own disciples—to reject all authoritative guides to spiritualunderstanding and fall back solely on their personal intuition. Rather, he isoffering them a simple and pragmatic outlet from the morass of doubt andperplexity in which they are immersed. By the use of skillful methods ofinquiry, he leads them to understand a number of basic principles that they canverify by their own experience and thereby acquire a sure starting point forfurther spiritual development.1Always underlying the Buddha’s questions and their replies is the tacit premisethat people are primarily motivated to act by a concern for their own welfareand happiness. In asking this particular set of questions, the Buddha’s purposeis to lead the Kālāmas to see that, even when we suspend all concern withfuture lives, unwholesome mental states such as greed, hatred, and delusion, andunwholesome actions such as killing and stealing, eventually redound to one’sown harm and suffering right here and now. Conversely, wholesome mental statesand wholesome actions promote one’s long-term welfare and happiness here andnow. Once this much is seen, the immediately visible harmful consequences towhich unwholesome mental states lead become a sufficient reason for abandoningthem, while the visible benefits to which wholesome mental states lead become asufficient motivation for cultivating them. Then, whether or not there is a lifeafter death, one has adequate reasons in the present life to abandon unwholesomemental states and cultivate wholesome mental states. If there is an afterlife,one’s recompense is simply that much greater.A similar approach underlies Text III,3, in which the Buddha demonstrates howpresent suffering arises and ceases in correlation with present craving. Thisshort sutta, addressed to a lay follower, concisely articulates the causalprinciple that lies behind the Four Noble Truths, but rather than doing so inthe abstract, it adopts a concrete, down-to-earth approach that has a remarkablycontemporary appeal. By using powerful examples drawn from the life of a laymandeeply attached to his wife and son, the sutta makes a deep and lastingimpression on us.The fact that such texts as this sutta and the Kālāma Sutta do not dwell onthe doctrines of kamma and rebirth does not mean, as is sometimes assumed, thatsuch teachings are mere cultural accretions to the Dhamma that can be deleted orexplained away without losing anything essential. It means only that, at theoutset, the Dhamma can be approached in ways that do not require reference topast and future lives. The Buddha’s teaching has many sides, and thus, fromcertain angles, it can be directly evaluated against our concern for our presentwell-being and happiness. Once we see that the practice of the teaching doesindeed bring peace, joy, and inner security in this very life, this will inspireour trust and confidence in the Dhamma as a whole, including those aspects thatlie beyond our present capacity for personal verification. If we were toundertake certain practices—practices that require highly refined skills anddetermined effort—we would be able to acquire the faculties needed to validatethose other aspects, such as the law of kamma, the reality of rebirth, and theexistence of supersensible realms (see Text VII,4 §§23–24 and Text VII,5§§19–20).Another major problem that often besets spiritual seekers is the demands thatteachers place upon their capacity for trust. This problem has become especiallyacute in our own time, when the news media gleefully spotlight the frailties ofnumberless gurus and jump at the chance to show up any modern-day saint asnothing better than a swindler in robes. But the problem of rogue gurus is aperennial one by no means peculiar to our age. Whenever one person exercisesspiritual authority over others, it is only too easy for that person to betempted to exploit the trust others place in him in ways that can be seriouslydetrimental to himself and his disciples. When a pupil approaches a teacher whoclaims to be perfectly enlightened and thus capable of teaching the path tofinal liberation, the pupil must have some criteria at hand for testing theteacher to determine whether the teacher truly measures up to the lofty claimshe makes about himself—or that others make about him.In the Vīmaṃsaka Sutta—Text III,4—the Buddha lays down guidelines by which amonk can test “the Tathāgata,” that is, the Buddha, to evaluate his claim to beperfectly enlightened. One benchmark of perfect enlightenment is freedom of themind from all defilements. If a monk cannot directly see into the Buddha’s ownmind, he can nevertheless rely on indirect evidence to ascertain that the Buddhais freed from defilements; that is, by evaluating the Buddha’s bodily deeds andspeech he can infer that the Buddha’s mental states are exclusively pure,uninfluenced by greed, hatred, and delusion. In addition to such observationalinference, the Buddha further encourages the monk to approach him and directlyinquire about his mental states.Once the pupil gains confidence that the Buddha is a qualified teacher, he thenputs the Master to the ultimate test. He learns his teaching, enters upon thepractice, and penetrates the Dhamma by direct knowledge. This act ofpenetration—here equivalent at minimum to the attainment of stream-entry—bringsthe gain of “invincible faith,” the faith of one who is established upon theirreversible path leading to final release.Taken in isolation, the Vīmaṃsaka Sutta might give the impression that oneacquires faith only after gaining realization of the teaching, and sincerealization is self-validating, faith would then become redundant. Thisimpression, however, would be one-sided. The point the sutta is making is thatfaith becomes invincible as a result of realization, not that faith first entersthe spiritual path only when one attains realization. Faith is the first of thefive spiritual faculties, and in some degree, as trusting confidence in theBuddha’s enlightenment and in the main principles of his teaching, it is aprerequisite for the higher training. We see faith functioning in thispreparatory role in Text III,5, a long excerpt from the Caṅkī Sutta. Here, theBuddha explains that a person who has faith in something “preserves truth” whenhe says “this is my faith.” He “preserves truth” because he merely states whathe believes without jumping to the conclusion that what he believes isdefinitely true and anything else contrary to it false. The Buddha contrasts the“preservation of truth” (saccānurakkhanā) with the “discovery of truth”(saccānubodha), which begins by placing faith in a teacher who has provedhimself worthy of trust. Having gained faith in such a teacher, one thenapproaches him for instruction, learns the Dhamma, practices it (according to aseries of steps more finely calibrated than in the preceding text), and finallysees the supreme truth for oneself.This does not yet mark the end of the road for the disciple, but only theinitial breakthrough to the truth, again corresponding to the attainment ofstream-entry. Having achieved the vision of truth, to reach the “final arrivalat truth” (saccānupatti)—that is, the attainment of arahantship or finalliberation—one must repeat, develop, and cultivate the same series of stepsuntil one has fully absorbed and assimilated the supreme truth disclosed by thatinitial vision. Thus the entire process of training in the Dhamma is rooted inpersonal experience. Even faith should be rooted in investigation and inquiryand not based solely upon emotional leanings and blind belief. Faith alone isinsufficient but is the door to deeper levels of experience. Faith serves as aspur to practice; practice leads to experiential understanding; and when one’sunderstanding matures, it blossoms in full realization.III. APPROACHING THE DHAMMA1. NOT A SECRET DOCTRINE“These three things, monks, are conducted in secret, not openly. What three?Affairs with women, the mantras of the brahmins, and wrong view.“But these three things, monks, shine openly, not in secret. What three? Themoon, the sun, and the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”(AN 3:129; I 282–83)2. NO DOGMAS OR BLIND BELIEFThus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tourtogether with a large Saṅgha of monks when he arrived at a town of theKālāmas named Kesaputta.2 Now the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard: “It is saidthat the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan son who went forth from a Sakyan family, hasarrived at Kesaputta. Now a good report about that master Gotama has beencirculating thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened,accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world,unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, theEnlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized with his own direct knowledgethis world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its asceticsand brahmins, with its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teachesa Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,with the right meaning and expression; he reveals a spiritual life that isperfectly complete and purified.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”3Then the Kālāmas of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage tohim and sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with him and, after theirgreetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side; some saluted him reverentiallyand sat down to one side; some remained silent and sat down to one side. Thenthe Kālāmas said to the Blessed One:“Venerable sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta explain andelucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, debunk, revile, and vilify thedoctrines of others. But then some other ascetics and brahmins come toKesaputta, and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, butdisparage, debunk, revile, and vilify the doctrines of the others. For us,venerable sir, there is perplexity and doubt as to which of these good asceticsspeak truth and which speak falsehood.”“It is fitting for you to be perplexed, O Kālāmas, it is fitting for you to bein doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. Come, Kālāmas. Donot go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection oftexts, by logic, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by theacceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence of a speaker,or because you think, ‘The ascetic is our teacher.’4 But when you know foryourselves, ‘These things are unwholesome; these things are blamable; thesethings are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, leadto harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.“What do you think, Kālāmas? When greed, hatred, and delusion arise in aperson, is it for his welfare or harm?”5—“For his harm, venerablesir.”—“Kālāmas, a person who is greedy, hating, and deluded, overpowered bygreed, hatred, and delusion, his thoughts controlled by them, will destroy life,take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, and tell lies; he will alsoprompt others to do likewise. Will that conduce to his harm and suffering for along time?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”“What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome orunwholesome?—”Unwholesome, venerable sir.”—“Blamable or blameless?”—“Blamable,venerable sir.”—“Censured or praised by the wise?”—“Censured, venerablesir.”—“Undertaken and practiced, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, orhow is it in this case?”—“Undertaken and practiced, these things lead to harmand suffering. So it appears to us in this case.”“It was for this reason, Kālāmas, that we said: Do not go by oral tradition. …“Come, Kālāmas. Do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, byhearsay, by a collection of texts, by logic, by inferential reasoning, byreasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by theseeming competence of a speaker, or because you think, ‘The ascetic is ourteacher.’ But when you know for yourselves, ‘These things are wholesome; thesethings are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, ifundertaken and practiced, lead to welfare and happiness,’ then you should engagein them.“What do you think, Kālāmas? When nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion arisein a person, is it for his welfare or harm?”—“For his welfare, venerablesir.”—“Kālāmas, a person who is without greed, without hatred, withoutdelusion, not overpowered by greed, hatred, and delusion, his thoughts notcontrolled by them, will abstain from the destruction of life, from taking whatis not given, from sexual misconduct, and from false speech; he will also promptothers to do likewise. Will that conduce to his welfare and happiness for a longtime?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”“What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome orunwholesome?—”Wholesome, venerable sir.”—“Blamable or blameless?” —“Blameless,venerable sir.”—“Censured or praised by the wise?”—“Praised, venerablesir.”—“Undertaken and practiced, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not,or how is it in this case?”—“Undertaken and practiced, these things lead towelfare and happiness. So it appears to us in this case.”“It was for this reason, Kālāmas, that we said: Do not go upon oraltradition….“Then, Kālāmas, that noble disciple—devoid of covetousness, devoid of illwill, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful—dwells pervading onequarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter,the third, and the fourth.6 Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and toall as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued withloving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility and without illwill.“He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion ... withaltruistic joy ... with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third, andthe fourth. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself,he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast,exalted, measureless, without hostility and without ill will.“When, Kālāmas, this noble disciple has thus made his mind free of enmity,free of ill will, uncorrupted and pure, he has won four assurances in this verylife.“The first assurance he has won is this: ‘If there is another world, and if goodand bad deeds bear fruit and yield results, it is possible that with the breakupof the body, after death, I shall arise in a good destination, in a heavenlyworld.’“The second assurance he has won is this: ‘If there is no other world, and ifgood and bad deeds do not bear fruit and yield results, still right here, inthis very life, I live happily, free of enmity and ill will.“The third assurance he has won is this: ‘Suppose evil befalls the evil-doer.Then, as I do not intend evil for anyone, how can suffering afflict me, one whodoes no evil deed?’“The fourth assurance he has won is this: ‘Suppose evil does not befall theevil-doer. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.’7“When, Kālāmas, this noble disciple has thus made his mind free of enmity,free of ill will, uncorrupted, and pure, he has won these four assurances inthis very life.”“So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! When this noble disciple hasthus made his mind free of enmity, free of ill will, uncorrupted and pure, hehas won these four assurances in this very life.“Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The Blessed One hasmade the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what hadbeen overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost,or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms.We now go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha ofmonks. Let the Blessed One accept us as lay followers who have gone for refugefrom today until life’s end.”8(AN 3:65; I 188–93)3. THE VISIBLE ORIGIN AND PASSING AWAY OF SUFFERINGOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at a town of the Mallans namedUruvelakappa. Then Bhadraka the headman9 approached the Blessed One, paid homageto him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “It would be good, venerable sir,if the Blessed One would teach me about the origin and the passing away ofsuffering.”“If, headman, I were to teach you about the origin and the passing away ofsuffering with reference to the past, saying, ‘So it was in the past,’perplexity and uncertainty about that might arise in you. And if I were to teachyou about the origin and the passing away of suffering with reference to thefuture, saying, ‘So it will be in the future,’ perplexity and uncertainty aboutthat might arise in you. Instead, headman, while I am sitting right here, andyou are sitting right there, I will teach you about the origin and the passingaway of suffering. Listen and attend closely, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” Bhadraka replied. The Blessed One said this:“What do you think, headman? Are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whoseaccount sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair would arise in you ifthey were to be executed, imprisoned, fined, or censured?”“There are such people, venerable sir.”“But are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair would not arise in you in such an event?”“There are such people, venerable sir.”“Why is it, headman, that in relation to some people in Uruvelakappa sorrow,lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair would arise in you if they were to beexecuted, imprisoned, fined, or censured, while in regard to others they wouldnot arise in you?”“Those people in Uruvelakappa, venerable sir, in relation to whom sorrow,lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair would arise in me if they were to beexecuted, imprisoned, fined, or censured—these are the ones for whom I havedesire and attachment. But those people in Uruvelakappa in relation to whom theywould not arise in me—these are the ones for whom I have no desire andattachment.”“Headman, by means of this principle that is seen, understood, immediatelyattained, fathomed, apply the method to the past and to the future thus:‘Whatever suffering arose in the past, all that arose rooted in desire, withdesire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering. Whatever sufferingwill arise in the future, all that will arise rooted in desire, with desire asits source; for desire is the root of suffering.’”“It is wonderful, venerable sir! It is amazing, venerable sir! How well that hasbeen stated by the Blessed One: ‘Whatever suffering arises, all that is rootedin desire, has desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.’10Venerable sir, I have a son named Ciravāsī, who stays at an outside residence.I rise early and send a man, saying, ‘Go, man, and find out how Ciravāsī is.’Until that man returns, venerable sir, I am upset, thinking, ‘I hope Ciravāsīhas not met with any affliction!’”“What do you think, headman? If Ciravāsī were to be executed, imprisoned,fined, or censured, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despairarise in you?”“Venerable sir, if Ciravāsī were to be executed, imprisoned, fined, orcensured, even my life would seem futile, so how could sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair not arise in me?”“In this way too, headman, it can be understood: ‘Whatever suffering arises, allthat arises rooted in desire, with desire as its source; for desire is the rootof suffering.’“What do you think, headman? Before you saw your wife or heard about her, didyou have any desire, attachment, or affection for her?”“No, venerable sir.”“Then was it, headman, only when you saw her or heard about her that thisdesire, attachment, and affection arose in you?”“Yes, venerable sir.”“What do you think, headman? If your wife were to be executed, imprisoned,fined, or censured, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despairarise in you?”“Venerable sir, if my wife were to be executed, imprisoned, fined, or censured,even my life would seem futile, so how could sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair not arise in me?”“In this way too, headman, it can be understood: ‘Whatever suffering arises, allthat arises rooted in desire, with desire as its source; for desire is the rootof suffering.’”(SN 42:11; IV 327–30)4. INVESTIGATE THE TEACHER HIMSELF1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the monks thus:“Monks!”—“Venerable sir!” they replied. The Blessed One said this:2. “Monks, a monk who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge another’s mind,11should make an investigation of the Tathāgata in order to find out whether ornot he is perfectly enlightened.”3. “Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by theBlessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be good if theBlessed One would explain the meaning of these words. Having heard it from him,the monks will remember it.”“Then listen, monks, and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, venerable sir,” the monks replied. The Blessed One said this:4. “Monks, a monk who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge another’s mind,should investigate the Tathāgata with respect to two kinds of states, statescognizable through the eye and through the ear thus: ‘Are there found in theTathāgata or not any defiled states cognizable through the eye or through theear?’12 When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘No defiled statescognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’5. “When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Are therefound in the Tathāgata or not any mixed states cognizable through the eye orthrough the ear?’13 When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘No mixed statescognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’6. “When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Are therefound in the Tathāgata or not cleansed states cognizable through the eye orthrough the ear?’ When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘Cleansed statescognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’7. “When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Has thisvenerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or did he attain itrecently?’ When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘This venerable one hasattained this wholesome state over a long time; he did not attain it onlyrecently.’8. “When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Has thisvenerable one acquired renown and attained fame, so that the dangers [connectedwith renown and fame] are found in him?’ For, monks, as long as a monk has notacquired renown and attained fame, the dangers [connected with renown and fame]are not found in him; but when he has acquired renown and attained fame, thosedangers are found in him.14 When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘Thisvenerable one has acquired renown and attained fame, but the dangers [connectedwith renown and fame] are not found in him.’9. “When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Is thisvenerable one restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and does he avoidindulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through thedestruction of lust?’ When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘Thisvenerable one is restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and he avoidsindulging in sensual pleasure because he is without lust through the destructionof lust.’10. “Now, monks, if others should ask that monk thus: ‘What are the venerableone’s reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says: “That venerable one isrestrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and he avoids indulging insensual pleasures because he is without lust through the destruction oflust”?’—answering rightly, that monk would answer thus: ‘Whether that venerableone dwells in the Saṅgha or alone, while some there are well behaved and someare ill behaved and some there teach a group, while some here are seen concernedabout material things and some are unsullied by material things, still thatvenerable one does not despise anyone because of that.15 And I have heard andlearned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: “I am restrained without fear, notrestrained by fear, and I avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because I amwithout lust through the destruction of lust.”’11. “The Tathāgata, monks, should be questioned further about that thus: ‘Arethere found in the Tathāgata or not any defiled states cognizable through theeye or through the ear?’ The Tathāgata would answer thus: ‘No defiled statescognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’12. “If asked, ‘Are there found in the Tathāgata or not any mixed statescognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the Tathāgata would answerthus: ‘No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are foundin the Tathāgata.’13. “If asked, ‘Are there found in the Tathāgata or not cleansed statescognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the Tathāgata would answerthus: ‘Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are foundin the Tathāgata. They are my pathway and my domain, yet I do not identify withthem.’14. “Monks, a disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus in order tohear the Dhamma. The Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with its successively higherlevels, with its successively more sublime levels, with its dark and brightcounterparts. As the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to a monk in this way, throughdirect knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma, the monk comes to aconclusion about the teachings.16 He places confidence in the Teacher thus: ‘TheBlessed One is perfectly enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by theBlessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the good way.’15. “Now if others should ask that monk thus: ‘What are the venerable one’sreasons and what is his evidence whereby he says, “The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha ispracticing the good way”?’—answering rightly, that monk would answer thus:‘Here, friends, I approached the Blessed One in order to hear the Dhamma. TheBlessed One taught me the Dhamma with its successively higher levels, with itssuccessively more sublime levels, with its dark and bright counterparts. As theBlessed One taught the Dhamma to me in this way, through direct knowledge of acertain teaching here in that Dhamma, I came to a conclusion about theteachings. I placed confidence in the Teacher thus: “The Blessed One isperfectly enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, theSaṅgha is practicing the good way.”’16. “Monks, when anyone’s faith has been planted, rooted, and established in theTathāgata through these reasons, terms, and phrases, his faith is said to besupported by reasons, rooted in vision, firm; it is invincible by any ascetic orbrahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.17 That is how,monks, there is an investigation of the Tathāgata in accordance with theDhamma, and that is how the Tathāgata is well investigated in accordance withthe Dhamma.”That is what the Blessed One said. The monks were satisfied and delighted in theBlessed One’s words.(MN 47: Vīmaṃsaka Sutta; I 317–20)5. STEPS TOWARD THE REALIZATION OF TRUTH10. Then the brahmin Caṅkī,18 together with a large company of brahmins, wentto the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him, and sat down at one side.11. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some amiable talkwith some very senior brahmins. At the time, sitting in the assembly, was abrahmin student named Kāpaṭhika. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, hewas a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, andetymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, hewas fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man. Whilethe very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One, he repeatedlybroke in and interrupted their talk. Then the Blessed One rebuked the brahminstudent Kāpaṭhika thus: “The honorable Bhāradvāja19 shouldn’t break in andinterrupt the talk of the very senior brahmins while they are conversing. Heshould wait until the talk is finished.”When this was said, the brahmin Caṅkī said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotamashouldn’t rebuke the brahmin student Kāpaṭhika. This brahmin student is verylearned; he has a good delivery; he is wise. He can well take part in thisdiscussion with Master Gotama.”12. Then the Blessed One thought: “Surely, since the brahmins honor him thus,the brahmin student Kāpaṭhika must be accomplished in the scriptures of thethree Vedas.”Then the brahmin student Kāpaṭhika thought: “When the ascetic Gotama catchesmy eye, I shall ask him a question.”Then, knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student Kāpaṭhika’smind, the Blessed One turned his eye toward him. Then the brahmin studentKāpaṭhika thought: “The ascetic Gotama has turned toward me. Suppose I ask hima question.” Then he said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, in regard to theancient brahmin hymns that have come down through oral transmission, preservedin the collections, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: ‘Only this istrue, anything else is wrong.’ What does Master Gotama say about this?”13. “How then, Bhāradvāja, among the brahmins is there even a single brahminwho says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else iswrong’?”—“No, Master Gotama.”“How then, Bhāradvāja, among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or asingle teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who saysthus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else iswrong’?”—“No, Master Gotama.”“How then, Bhāradvāja, the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns,the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted,uttered, and compiled, the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeatingwhat was spoken and reciting what was recited—that is, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka,Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa,and Bhagu20—did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus: ‘We know this, we seethis: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?”—“No, Master Gotama.”“So, Bhāradvāja, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a singlebrahmin who says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anythingelse is wrong.’ And among the brahmins there is not even a single teacher or asingle teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers, who saysthus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ Andthe ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns... even these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus: ‘We know this, we seethis: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ Suppose there were a file ofblind men each in touch with the next: the first one does not see, the middleone does not see, and the last one does not see. So too, Bhāradvāja, in regardto their statement the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the firstone does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.What do you think, Bhāradvāja, that being so, does not the faith of thebrahmins turn out to be groundless?”14. “The brahmins honor this not only out of faith, Master Gotama. They alsohonor it as oral tradition.”“Bhāradvāja, first you took your stand on faith, now you speak of oraltradition. There are five things, Bhāradvāja, that may turn out in twodifferent ways here and now. What five? Faith, approval, oral tradition,reasoned cogitation, and acceptance of a view as a result of pondering it.21These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now. Now somethingmay be fully accepted out of faith, yet it may be empty, hollow, and false; butsomething else may not be fully accepted out of faith, yet it may be factual,true, and unmistaken. Again, something may be fully approved of … welltransmitted … well cogitated ... well pondered, yet it may be empty, hollow, andfalse; but something else may not be well pondered, yet it may be factual, true,and unmistaken. [Under these conditions] it is not proper for a wise man whopreserves truth to come to the definite conclusion: ‘Only this is true, anythingelse is wrong.’”2215. “But, Master Gotama, in what way is there the preservation of truth?23 Howdoes one preserve truth? We ask Master Gotama about the preservation of truth.”“If a person has faith, Bhāradvāja, he preserves truth when he says: ‘My faithis thus’; but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion: ‘Only this istrue, anything else is wrong.’ In this way, Bhāradvāja, there is thepreservation of truth; in this way he preserves truth; in this way we describethe preservation of truth. But as yet there is no discovery of truth.24“If a person approves of something … if he receives an oral tradition … if he[reaches a conclusion based on] reasoned cogitation … if he accepts a view as aresult of pondering it, he preserves truth when he says: ‘The view that I acceptas a result of pondering it is thus’; but he does not yet come to the definiteconclusion: ‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ In this way too,Bhāradvāja, there is the preservation of truth; in this way he preservestruth; in this way we describe the preservation of truth. But as yet there is nodiscovery of truth.”16. “In that way, Master Gotama, there is the preservation of truth; in that wayone preserves truth; in that way we recognize the preservation of truth. But inwhat way, Master Gotama, is there the discovery of truth? In what way does onediscover truth? We ask Master Gotama about the discovery of truth.”17. “Here, Bhāradvāja, a monk may be living in dependence on some village ortown. Then a householder or a householder’s son goes to him and investigates himin regard to three kinds of states: in regard to states based on greed, inregard to states based on hate, and in regard to states based on delusion: ‘Arethere in this monk any states based on greed such that, with his mind obsessedby those states, while not knowing he might say, “I know,” or while not seeinghe might say, “I see,” or he might urge others to act in a way that would leadto their harm and suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him he comes toknow: ‘There are no such states based on greed in this monk. The bodily andverbal behavior of this monk are not those of one affected by greed. And theDhamma that he teaches is profound, hard to see and hard to understand, peacefuland sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by thewise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by greed.’18. “When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from statesbased on greed, he next investigates him in regard to states based on hate: ‘Arethere in this monk any states based on hate such that, with his mind obsessed bythose states ... he might urge others to act in a way that would lead to theirharm and suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him, he comes to know:‘There are no such states based on hate in this monk. The bodily and verbalbehavior of this monk are not those of one affected by hate. And the Dhamma thathe teaches is profound … to be experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannoteasily be taught by one affected by hate.’19. “When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from statesbased on hate, he next investigates him in regard to states based on delusion:‘Are there in this monk any states based on delusion such that, with his mindobsessed by those states ... he might urge others to act in a way that wouldlead to their harm and suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him, hecomes to know: ‘There are no such states based on delusion in this monk. Thebodily and verbal behavior of this monk are not those of one affected bydelusion. And the Dhamma that he teaches is profound … to be experienced by thewise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by delusion.’20. “When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from statesbased on delusion, then he places faith in him; filled with faith he visits himand pays respect to him; having paid respect to him, he gives ear; when he givesear, he hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma, he memorizes it and examinesthe meaning of the teachings he has memorized; when he examines their meaning,he accepts those teachings as a result of pondering them; when he has acceptedthose teachings as a result of pondering them, desire springs up; when desirehas sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinizes;having scrutinized, he strives; resolutely striving, he realizes with the bodythe supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.25 In this way,Bhāradvāja, there is the discovery of truth; in this way one discovers truth;in this way we describe the discovery of truth.

The Happiness Visible in This Present Life009 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_009_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONIs it the case, as some scholars hold, that the Buddha’s original message wasexclusively one of world-transcending liberation, with little relevance forpeople stuck in the routines of worldly life? Did the ancient Buddhists believethat it was only in the monastery that the real practice of the Dhamma began andthat only those who left the world were considered proper receptacles of theteaching? Did the Buddha’s teachings for the laity have no more than a tokensignificance? Were they mainly injunctions to acquire merit by offering materialsupport to the monastic order and its members so that they could become monksand nuns (preferably monks) in future lives and then get down to the realpractice?At certain periods, in almost all traditions, Buddhists have lent support to theassumptions that underlie these questions. They have spurned concern with thepresent life and dismissed the world as a valley of tears, a deceptive illusion,convinced that the sign of spiritual maturity is an exclusive focus onemancipation from the round of birth and death. Monks have sometimes displayedlittle interest in showing those still stuck in the world how to use the wisdomof the Dhamma to deal with the problems of ordinary life. Householders in turnhave seen little hope of spiritual progress in their own chosen mode of life andhave thus resigned themselves merely to gaining merit by offering materialsupport to the monks.While the Nikāyas reveal the crown of the Buddha’s teachings to lie in the pathto final release from suffering, it would be a mistake to reduce the teachings,so diverse in the original sources, to their transcendent pinnacle. We mustagain recall the statement that a Buddha arises “for the welfare of themultitude, for the happiness of the multitude … out of compassion for the world,for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans” (p. 50). The functionof a Buddha is to discover, realize, and proclaim the Dhamma in its full rangeand depth, and this involves a comprehensive understanding of the variedapplications of the Dhamma in all its multiple dimensions. A Buddha not onlypenetrates to the unconditioned state of perfect bliss that lies beyondsaṃsāra, outside the pale of birth, aging, and death; he not only proclaimsthe path to full enlightenment and final liberation; but he also illuminates themany ways the Dhamma applies to the complex conditions of human life for peoplestill immersed in the world.The Dhamma, in its broadest sense, is the immanent, invariable order of theuniverse in which truth, lawful regularity, and virtue are inextricably merged.This cosmic Dhamma is reflected in the human mind as the aspiration for truth,spiritual beauty, and goodness; it is expressed in human conduct as wholesomebodily, verbal, and mental action. The Dhamma has institutional embodiments aswell as expressions in the lives of individuals who look upon it as their sourceof guidance in the proper conduct of life. These embodiments are both secularand spiritual. Buddhist tradition sees the responsibility for upholding theDhamma in the secular domain as falling to the legendary wheel-turning monarch(rājā cakkavattī). The wheel-turning monarch is the benevolent ruler whogoverns his kingdom in accordance with the highest ethical norms (dhammikodhammarājā) and thereby peacefully unites the world under a reign of universaljustice and prosperity. As Text IV,1(1) shows, within the spiritual domain, theBuddha is the counterpart of the wheel-turning monarch. Like the latter, theBuddha relies on the Dhamma and reveres the Dhamma, but whereas thewheel-turning monarch relies upon the Dhamma as principle of righteousness torule his kingdom, the Buddha relies upon the Dhamma as ethical and spiritualnorm to teach and transform human beings and guide them toward proper conduct ofbody, speech, and mind. Neither the wheel-turning monarch nor the Buddha createsthe Dhamma they uphold, yet neither can perform their respective functionswithout it; for the Dhamma is the objective, impersonal, ever-existent principleof order that serves as the source and standard for their respective policiesand promulgations.As the king of the Dhamma, the Buddha takes up the task of promoting the truegood, welfare, and happiness of the world. He does so by teaching the people ofthe world how to live in accordance with the Dhamma and behave in such a waythat they can attain realization of the same liberating Dhamma that he realizedthrough his enlightenment. The Pāli commentaries demonstrate the broad scope ofthe Dhamma by distinguishing three types of benefit that the Buddha’s teachingis intended to promote, graded hierarchically according to their relative merit:1. welfare and happiness directly visible in this present life(dị̣hadhamma-hitasukha ), attained by fulfilling one’s moral commitments andsocial responsibilities;2. welfare and happiness pertaining to the next life (sampar̄yikahitasukha ),attained by engaging in meritorious deeds;3. the ultimate good or supreme goal (paramattha), Nibbāna, final release fromthe cycle of rebirths, attained by developing the Noble Eightfold Path.While many Western writers on Early Buddhism have focused on this last aspect asalmost exclusively representing the Buddha’s original teaching, a balancedpresentation should give consideration to all three aspects. Therefore, in thischapter and those to follow, we will be exploring texts from the Nikāyas thatillustrate each of these three facets of the Dhamma.The present chapter includes a variety of texts on the Buddha’s teachings thatpertain to the happiness directly visible in this present life. The mostcomprehensive Nikāya text in this genre is the Sigālaka Sutta (DN 31, alsoknown as the Siṅgalovāda Sutta), sometimes called “The Layperson’s Code ofDiscipline.” The heart of this sutta is the section on “worshipping the sixdirections”—Text IV,1(2)—in which the Buddha freely reinterprets an ancientIndian ritual, infusing it with a new ethical meaning. The practice of“worshipping the six directions,” as explained by the Buddha, presupposes thatsociety is sustained by a network of interlocking relationships that bringcoherence to the social order when its members fulfill their reciprocal dutiesand responsibilities in a spirit of kindness, sympathy, and good will. The sixbasic social relationships that the Buddha draws upon to fill out his metaphorare: parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend andfriend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides. Each isconsidered one of the six directions in relation to its counterpart. For a youngman like Sigālaka, his parents are the east, his teachers the south, his wifeand children the west, his friends the north, his workers the nadir, andreligious guides the zenith. With his customary sense of systematic concision,the Buddha ascribes to each member of each pair five obligations with respect tohis or her counterpart; when each member fulfills these obligations, thecorresponding “direction” comes to be “at peace and free from fear.” “Thus, forEarly Buddhism, the social stability and security that contribute to humanhappiness are most effectively achieved when every member of society fulfillsthe various duties that befall them as determined by their social relationships.Each person rises above the demands of narrow self-interest and develops asincere, large-hearted concern for the welfare of others and the greater good ofthe whole.”From this general code of lay Buddhist ethics, we turn to texts that offer morespecific points of advice, beginning with a selection of suttas on “The Family.”This has separate sections on “Parents and Children” (IV,2(1)) and “Husbands andWives” (IV,2(2)). In keeping with the norms of Indian society—in fact, ofvirtually all traditional agrarian societies—the Buddha regards the family asthe basic unit of social integration and acculturation. It is especially theclose, loving relationship between parents and children that fosters the virtuesand sense of humane responsibility essential to a cohesive social order. Withinthe family, these values are transmitted from one generation to the next, andthus a harmonious society is highly dependent on harmonious relations betweenparents and children. The Buddha emphasizes filial piety—Text IV,2(1)(a)—and thegratitude of children to their parents, a debt they can adequately repay only byestablishing their parents in the proper Dhamma—Text IV,2(1)(b).Wholesome relations between parents and children depend in turn upon the mutualaffection and respect of husband and wife, and thus the Buddha also offersguidelines for proper relationships between married couples. These againemphasize a common commitment to ethical conduct and spiritual ideals. Ofspecial interest to us, at a time when many marriages end so soon in divorce, isthe Buddha’s advice to the loving couple Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā—TextIV,2(2)(b)—on how the love between a husband and his wife can be sustained sostrongly that they can be reunited in their future lives. This discourse alsoshows that far from demanding that his lay disciples spurn the desires of theworld, the Buddha was ready to show those still under the sway of worldly desirehow to obtain the objects of their desire. The one requirement he laid down wasthat the fulfillment of desire be regulated by ethical principles.Next come a number of texts dealing with different aspects of household lifeunited by an emphasis on right livelihood. Two characteristics of the Buddha’sinjunctions to his lay followers regarding the pursuit of mundane happinessstand out from these texts.First, in seeking “the good visible in this present life,” the lay followershould consistently adhere to principles of right conduct, especially to thefive precepts and the rules of right livelihood. Thus, for example, hestipulates that wealth must be “acquired by energetic striving … righteouswealth righteously gained”—Text IV,3. Again, he asks his lay followers to usethe wealth they obtain not only to gratify themselves but also to benefit theirdependents and others who live on charity, particularly virtuous ascetics andbrahmins—Text IV,4(2).Second, the lay follower should not rest content with the mere pursuit oftemporal well-being and happiness but should also seek the well-being andhappiness pertaining to the future life. This is to be done by fostering thosequalities that lead to a happy rebirth and the attainment of Nibbāna. Accordingto Texts IV,3 and IV,5, the principal virtues a lay follower should possess,leading to future welfare, are: (1) faith (in the Buddha as the EnlightenedOne), (2) moral discipline (as unbroken observance of the five precepts), (3)generosity (as application to charity, giving, and sharing), and (4) wisdom (asinsight into the arising and passing away of phenomena). For Early Buddhism, theideal householder is not merely a devout supporter of the monastic order but anoble person who has attained at least the first of the four stages ofrealization, the fruition of stream-entry (sotāpatti).Finally, with section 6, we come to a selection of texts on “the Community.” Iuse this word to refer broadly to both the Saṅgha, the monastic order, and thecivil society in which any branch of the monastic order must be rooted. From theNikāyas, it is clear that while the Buddha principally aimed at guiding peopletoward moral and spiritual progress, he was fully aware that their capacity formoral and spiritual development depends upon the material conditions of thesociety in which they live. He acutely realized that when people are mired inpoverty and oppressed by hunger and want, they will find it hard to hold to apath of moral rectitude. The sheer pain of hunger, and the need to ward off theelements and provide for their families, will compel them to stoop to types ofbehavior they would avoid if they could obtain fair employment and adequateremuneration for their services. Thus he saw that the provision of economicjustice is integral to social harmony and political stability.The first two texts included here prescribe two sets of guidelines for themonastic order. Both are excerpts from a long discourse the Buddha spoke shortlyafter the death of Mahāvīra, the leader of the Jains. According to theNikāyas, following their leader’s death, the Jain monastic order was alreadybeginning to split up, and the Buddha must have felt compelled to lay downguidelines to protect his own order from sharing the same fate after hispassing. Text IV,6(1) enumerates six qualities that lead to quarrels anddisputes, which the monks should be wary of and strive to eliminate when theydiscover them within themselves. Although these guidelines are laid down for themonks, they can easily be given a wider application to any organization, secularor religious, for it is the same six factors that lie at the bottom of allconflicts. The positive counterpart to this set of cautionary guidelines is TextIV,6(2), which enumerates “six principles of cordiality” that lead to love,respect, and harmony among the members of the community. Again, with appropriateadaptation, these principles—loving acts of body, speech, and mind; sharing ofpossessions; common observance of precepts; and unity of views—can be given anextended application beyond a monastic order to the wider community. The samesutta provides more detailed guidelines for preserving harmony in the monasticorder after the Buddha’s death, but these deal with aspects of monasticdiscipline too specialized for the present anthology.Text IV,6(3), a long excerpt from the Assalāyana Sutta, captures the Buddha indebate with a precocious brahmin pundit about the brahmins’ claims on behalf ofthe caste system. In the Buddha’s age the caste system was only beginning totake shape in northeast India and had not yet spawned the countless subdivisionsand rigid regulations that were to manacle Indian society through the centuries.Society was divided into four broad social classes: the brahmins, who performedthe priestly functions prescribed in the Vedas; the khattiyas, the nobles,warriors, and administrators; the vessas, the merchants and agriculturalists;and the suddas, the menials and serfs. There were also those outside the pale ofthe four main classes, who were regarded as even lower than the suddas. From theNikāyas it appears that the brahmins, while vested with authority in religiousmatters, had not yet attained the unchallengeable hegemony they were to gainafter the appearance of such works as the Laws of Manu, which laid down thefixed rules of the caste system. They had, however, already embarked on theirdrive for domination over the rest of Indian society and did so by propagatingthe thesis that brahmins are the highest caste, the divinely blessed offspringof Brahmā who are alone capable of purification.Contrary to certain popular notions, the Buddha did not agitate for theabolition of the Indian class system and attempt to establish a class-lesssociety. Within the Saṅgha, however, all caste distinctions were abrogated fromthe moment of ordination. People from any of the four social classes who wentforth under the Buddha renounced their class titles and prerogatives, becomingknown simply as disciples of the Sakyan son (that is, of the Buddha, who wasfrom the Sakyan clan). Whenever the Buddha and his disciples confronted thebrahmins’ claim to superiority, they argued vigorously against them. As our textshows, the Buddha maintained that all such claims were groundless. Purification,he contended, was the result of conduct, not of birth, and was thus accessibleto those of all four castes. The Buddha even stripped the term “brahmin” of itshereditary accretions, and hearkening back to its original connotation of holyman, defined the true brahmin as the arahant (see MN 98, not included in thisanthology).The next two selections suggest guidelines for political administration. Duringthe Buddha’s time two distinct forms of government prevailed among the states ofnorthern India in which the Buddha moved and taught, monarchical kingdoms andtribal republics. As a spiritual teacher, the Buddha did not prefer one type ofgovernment to the other, nor did he actively interfere in affairs of state. Buthis followers included leaders from both types of state, and thus heoccasionally offered them guidance intended to ensure that they would governtheir realms in accordance with ethical norms.The opening scene of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, the narrative of the Buddha’slast days—Text IV,6(4)—gives us a glimpse into this tumultuous phase of Indianhistory when Magadha, the rising star among the northern monarchies, wasexpanding in influence and absorbing its neighboring tribal republics. In thepassage reproduced here we see King Ajātasattu, the ruler of Magadha, settinghis sights on the Vajjian confederacy, the largest and best organized of thetribal republics. When the sutta opens, he sends his chief minister to inquirefrom the Buddha whether he has any chance of success in waging war against theVajjians. The Buddha questions Ānanda about seven conditions of socialstability that he had earlier taught the Vajjians, concluding that “as long asthey keep to these seven principles, as long as these principles remain inforce, the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.” He thenconvenes a meeting of the monks and teaches them seven analogous principles ofstability applicable to the monastic order.Since the eventual triumph of the monarchical type of government seemedinevitable, the Buddha sought to establish a model of kingship that could curbthe arbitrary exercise of power and subordinate the king to a higher authority.He did so by setting up the ideal of the “wheel-turning monarch,” the righteousking who rules in compliance with the Dhamma, the impersonal law ofrighteousness (see Text IV,1(1)). The Dhamma that he obeys is the ethical basisfor his rule. Symbolized by the sacred wheel-treasure, the Dhamma enables him tosubdue without force all the nations of the world and establish a universalreign of peace and virtue based on observance of the five precepts—see TextIV,6(5).The wheel-turning monarch rules for the welfare and happiness of his subjectsand extends protection to all within his realm, even to the birds and beasts.Among his duties is to prevent crime from erupting in his kingdom, and to keepthe kingdom safe from crime he must give wealth to those in need, for in theview of the Nikāyas poverty is the breeding ground of criminality. This theme,mentioned among the duties of the wheel-turning monarch in Text IV,6(5), iselaborated in Text IV,6(6). We here see a wise chaplain advise a king that thecorrect way to end the plague of theft and brigandage in his realm is not byimposing harsher punishments and stricter law enforcement, but by giving thecitizens the means to earn their living. Once the people enjoy a satisfactorystandard of living, they will lose all interest in harming others, and thecountry will enjoy peace and tranquillity.IV. THE HAPPINESS VISIBLE IN THIS PRESENT LIFE1. UPHOLDING THE DHAMMA IN SOCIETY(1) THE KING OF THE DHAMMAThe Blessed One said: “Monks, even a wheel-turning monarch, a just and righteousking, does not govern his realm without a co-regent.”When he had spoken, a certain monk addressed the Blessed One thus: “But who,venerable sir, is the co-regent of the wheel-turning monarch, the just andrighteous king?”“It is the Dhamma, the law of righteousness, O monk,” replied the Blessed One.1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en68]“In this case, the wheel-turning monarch, the just and righteous king, relyingon the Dhamma, honoring the Dhamma, esteeming and respecting it, with the Dhammaas his standard, banner, and sovereign, provides lawful protection, shelter, andsafety for his own dependents. He provides lawful protection, shelter, andsafety for the khattiyas attending on him; for his army, for the brahmins andhouseholders, for the inhabitants of town and countryside, for ascetics andbrahmins, for the beasts and birds.“A wheel-turning monarch, a just and righteous king, who thus provides lawfulprotection, shelter, and safety for all, is the one who rules by Dhamma only.And that rule cannot be overthrown by any hostile human being.“Even so, O monk, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One,the just and righteous king of the Dhamma, relying on the Dhamma, honoring theDhamma, esteeming and respecting it, with the Dhamma as his standard, banner,and sovereign, provides lawful protection, shelter, and safety in regard toaction by body, speech, and mind. [He teaches thus:] ‘Such bodily action shouldbe undertaken and such should not be undertaken. Such verbal action should beundertaken and such should not be undertaken. Such mental action should beundertaken and such should not be undertaken.’“The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, the just and righteousking of the Dhamma, who thus provides lawful protection, shelter, and safety inregard to action by body, speech, and mind, is the one who turns theincomparable wheel of the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma only. And thatwheel of the Dhamma cannot be turned back by any ascetic or brahmin, by any devaor Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en69](AN 3:14; I 109–10)(2) WORSHIPPING THE SIX DIRECTIONS1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha,at the Bamboo Grove, in the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then Sigālaka thehouseholder’s son, having got up early and gone out of Rājagaha, was payinghomage, with wet clothes and hair and with joined palms, to the differentdirections: to the east, the south, the west, the north, the nadir, and thezenith.2. And the Blessed One, having risen early and dressed, took his robe and bowland went to Rājagaha for alms. And seeing Sigālaka paying homage to thedifferent directions, he said: “Householder’s son, why have you got up early topay homage to the different directions?”“Venerable sir, my father, when he was dying, told me to do so. And so, out ofrespect for my father’s words, which I revere, honor, and hold sacred, I havegot up early to pay homage in this way to the six directions.”“But, householder’s son, that is not the right way to pay homage to the sixdirections according to the Noble One’s discipline.”“Well, venerable sir, how should one pay homage to the six directions accordingto the Noble One’s discipline? It would be good if the Blessed One would teachme the proper way to pay homage to the six directions according to the NobleOne’s discipline.”“Then listen and attend carefully, householder’s son, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” Sigālaka said. The Blessed One said this: ...27. “And how, householder’s son, does the noble disciple protect the sixdirections? These six things are to be regarded as the six directions. The eastdenotes mother and father. The south denotes teachers. The west denotes wife andchildren. The north denotes friends and companions. The nadir denotes servants,workers, and helpers. The zenith denotes ascetics and brahmins.28. “There are five ways in which a son should minister to his mother and fatheras the eastern direction. [He should think:] ‘Having been supported by them, Iwill support them. I will perform their duties for them. I will keep up thefamily tradition. I will be worthy of my heritage. After my parents’ deaths Iwill distribute gifts on their behalf.’ And there are five ways in which theparents, so ministered to by their son as the eastern direction, willreciprocate: they will restrain him from evil, support him in doing good, teachhim some skill, find him a suitable wife, and, in due time, hand over hisinheritance to him. In this way the eastern direction is covered, making it atpeace and free from fear.29. “There are five ways in which pupils should minister to their teachers asthe southern direction: by rising to greet them, by waiting on them, by beingattentive, by serving them, by mastering the skills they teach. And there arefive ways in which their teachers, thus ministered to by their pupils as thesouthern direction, will reciprocate: they will give thorough instruction, makesure they have grasped what they should have duly grasped, give them a thoroughgrounding in all skills, recommend them to their friends and colleagues, andprovide them with security in all directions. In this way the southern directionis covered, making it at peace and free from fear.30. “There are five ways in which a husband should minister to his wife as thewestern direction: by honoring her, by not disparaging her, by not beingunfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments.And there are five ways in which a wife, thus ministered to by her husband asthe western direction, will reciprocate: by properly organizing her work, bybeing kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, andby being skillful and diligent in all she has to do. In this way the westerndirection is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.31. “There are five ways in which a man should minister to his friends andcompanions as the northern direction: by gifts, by kindly words, by lookingafter their welfare, by treating them like himself, and by keeping his word. Andthere are five ways in which friends and companions, thus ministered to by a manas the northern direction, will reciprocate: by looking after him when he isinattentive, by looking after his property when he is inattentive, by being arefuge when he is afraid, by not deserting him when he is in trouble, and byshowing concern for his children. In this way the northern direction is covered,making it at peace and free from fear.32. “There are five ways in which a master should minister to his servants andworkers as the nadir: by arranging their work according to their strength, bysupplying them with food and wages, by looking after them when they are ill, bysharing special delicacies with them, and by letting them off work at the righttime. And there are five ways in which servants and workers, thus ministered toby their master as the nadir, will reciprocate: they will get up before him, goto bed after him, take only what they are given, do their work properly, and bebearers of his praise and good repute. In this way the nadir is covered, makingit at peace and free from fear.33. “There are five ways in which a man should minister to ascetics and brahminsas the zenith: by kindness in bodily deed, speech, and thought, by keeping openhouse for them, and by supplying their bodily needs. And the ascetics andbrahmins, thus ministered to by him as the zenith, will reciprocate in fiveways: they will restrain him from evil, encourage him to do good, bebenevolently compassionate toward him, teach him what he has not heard, andpoint out to him the way to heaven. In this way the zenith is covered, making itat peace and free from fear.”(from DN 31: Sigālaka Sutta; III 180–81, 187–91)2. THE FAMILY(1) PARENTS AND CHILDREN(A) RESPECT FOR PARENTS“Monks, those families dwell with Brahmā where at home the parents arerespected by their children. Those families dwell with the ancient teacherswhere at home the parents are respected by their children. Those families dwellwith the ancient deities where at home the parents are respected by thechildren. Those families dwell with the holy ones where at home the parents arerespected by their children.“‘Brahmā,’ monks, is a term for father and mother. ‘The ancient teachers’ is aterm for father and mother. ‘The ancient deities’ is a term for father andmother. ‘The holy ones’ is a term for father and mother. And why? Parents are ofgreat help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them theworld.”(AN 4:63; II 70)(B) REPAYING ONE’S PARENTS“Monks, I declare that there are two persons one can never repay. What two?One’s mother and father.“Even if one should carry about one’s mother on one shoulder and one’s father onthe other, and while doing so should live a hundred years, reach the age of ahundred years; and if one should attend to them by anointing them with balms, bymassaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, and they should even void theirexcrements there—even by that would one not do enough for one’s parents, norwould one repay them. Even if one were to establish one’s parents as the supremelords and rulers over this earth so rich in the seven treasures, one would notdo enough for them, nor would one repay them. For what reason? Parents are ofgreat help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them theworld.“But, monks, one who encourages his unbelieving parents, settles and establishesthem in faith; who encourages his immoral parents, settles and establishes themin moral discipline; who encourages his stingy parents, settles and establishesthem in generosity; who encourages his ignorant parents, settles and establishesthem in wisdom—such a one, monks, does enough for his parents: he repays themand more than repays them for what they have done.”(AN 2: iv, 2; I 61–62)(2) HUSBANDS AND WIVES(A) DIFFERENT KINDS OF MARRIAGESOn one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the highway between Madhurāand Verañjā, and a number of householders and their wives were traveling alongthe same road. Then the Blessed One left the road and sat down on a seat at thefoot of a tree. The householders and their wives saw the Blessed One sittingthere and approached him. Having paid homage to him, they sat down to one side,and the Blessed One then said to them:“Householders, there are these four kinds of marriages. What four? A wretchlives together with a wretch; a wretch lives together with a goddess; a godlives together with a wretch; a god lives together with a goddess.“And how does a wretch live together with a wretch? Here, householders, thehusband is one who destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexualmisconduct, speaks falsely, and indulges in wines, liquor, and intoxicants, thebasis for negligence; he is immoral, of bad character; he dwells at home with aheart obsessed by the stain of stinginess; he abuses and reviles ascetics andbrahmins. And his wife is exactly the same in all respects. It is in such a waythat a wretch lives together with a wretch.“And how does a wretch live together with a goddess? Here, householders, thehusband is one who destroys life … who abuses and reviles ascetics and brahmins.But his wife is one who abstains from the destruction of life ... from wines,liquor, and intoxicants; she is virtuous, of good character; she dwells at homewith a heart free from the stain of stinginess; she does not abuse or revileascetics and brahmins. It is in such a way that a wretch lives together with agoddess.“And how does a god live together with a wretch? Here, householders, the husbandis one who abstains from the destruction of life ... who does not abuse orrevile ascetics and brahmins. But his wife is one who destroys life ... whoabuses and reviles ascetics and brahmins. It is in such a way that a god livestogether with a wretch.“And how does a god live together with a goddess? Here, householders, thehusband is one who abstains from the destruction of life … from wines, liquor,and intoxicants; he is virtuous, of good character; he dwells at home with aheart free from the stain of stinginess; he does not abuse or revile asceticsand brahmins. And his wife is exactly the same in all respects. It is in such away that a god lives together with a goddess.“These, householders, are the four kinds of marriages.”(AN 4:53; II 57–59)(B) HOW TO BE UNITED IN FUTURE LIVESOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhagga people, nearSuṃsumāragiri, in the Deer Park of the Bhesakalā Grove. One morning theBlessed One dressed, took his upper robe and bowl, and went to the dwelling ofthe householder Nakulapitā.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en70] Having arrived there, he satdown on the seat prepared for him. Then the householder Nakulapitā and thehousewife Nakulamātā approached the Blessed One and, after paying homage tohim, sat down to one side. So seated, the householder Nakulapitā said to theBlessed One:“Venerable sir, ever since the young housewife Nakulamātā was brought home tome when I too was still young, I am not aware of having wronged her even in mythoughts, still less in my deeds. Our wish is to be in one another’s sight solong as this life lasts and in the future life as well.”Then Nakulamātā the housewife addressed the Blessed One thus: “Venerable sir,ever since I was taken to the home of my young husband Nakulapitā, while beinga young girl myself, I am not aware of having wronged him even in my thoughts,still less in my deeds. Our wish is to be in one another’s sight so long as thislife lasts and in the future life as well.”Then the Blessed One spoke thus: “If, householders, both wife and husband wishto be in one another’s sight so long as this life lasts and in the future lifeas well, they should have the same faith, the same moral discipline, the samegenerosity, the same wisdom; then they will be in one another’s sight so long asthis life lasts and in the future life as well.”When both are faithful and generous,Self-restrained, of righteous living,They come together as husband and wifeFull of love for each other. Many blessings come their way,They dwell together in happiness,Their enemies are left dejected,When both are equal in virtue.Having lived by Dhamma in this world,The same in virtue and observance,They rejoice after death in the deva-world,Enjoying abundant happiness.(AN 4:55; II 61–62)(C) SEVEN KINDS OF WIVESOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove,Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. In the morning the Blessed One dressed, took hisbowl and robe, and went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s house, where he sat down in a seatprepared for him. On that occasion people in the house were making an uproar anda racket. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paidhomage to him, and sat down to one side.4[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en71] The Blessed One then said tohim: “Why are people in your house making this uproar and racket, householder?One would think they were fishermen making a haul of fish.”“That, venerable sir, is our daughter-in-law Sujātā. She is rich and has beenbrought here from a rich family. She does not obey her father-in-law andmother-in-law, nor her husband. She does not even honor, respect, esteem, andvenerate the Blessed One.”Then the Blessed One called the daughter-in-law Sujātā, saying, “Come,Sujātā.”“Yes, venerable sir,” she replied, and she went to the Blessed One, paid homageto him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her: “There arethese seven kinds of wives, Sujātā. What seven? One like a slayer, one like athief, one like a tyrant, one like a mother, one like a sister, one like afriend, and one like a handmaid. These are the seven kinds of wives. Now whichof these seven are you?”“I do not understand in detail the meaning of the Blessed One’s brief statement.It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma insuch a way that I might understand the meaning in detail.”“Then listen, Sujātā, and attend carefully. I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” Sujātā replied. The Blessed One said this:“With hateful mind, cold and heartless,Lusting for others, despising her husband;Who seeks to kill the one who bought her—Such a wife is called a slayer. “When her husband acquires wealthBy his craft or trade or farm work,She tries to filch a little for herself—Such a wife is called a thief. “The slothful glutton, bent on idling,Harsh, fierce, rough in speech,A woman who bullies her own supporter—Such a wife is called a tyrant. “One who is always helpful and kind,Who guards her husband as a mother her son,Who carefully protects the wealth he earns—Such a wife is called a mother. “She who holds her husband in high regardAs younger sister holds the elder born,Who humbly submits to her husband’s will—Such a wife is called a sister. “One who rejoices at her husband’s sightAs one friend might welcome another,Well raised, virtuous, devoted—Such a wife is called a friend. “One without anger, afraid of punishment,Who bears with her husband free of hate,Who humbly submits to her husband’s will—Such a wife is called a handmaid.5[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en72] “The types of wives here called a slayer,A thief, and the wife like a tyrant,These kinds of wives, with the body’s breakup,Will be reborn deep in hell. “But wives like mother, sister, friend,And the wife called a handmaid,Steady in virtue, long restrained,With the body’s breakup go to heaven.“These, Sujātā, are the seven kinds of wives. Now which of these are you?”“Beginning today, venerable sir, you should consider me a wife who is like ahandmaid.”(AN 7:59; IV 91–94)3. PRESENT WELFARE, FUTURE WELFAREOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans where there wasa market town of the Koliyans named Kakkarapatta. Then the Koliyan family manDīghajānu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to oneside. So seated, he said to the Blessed One:“Venerable sir, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures, dwelling at homein a bed crowded with children, enjoying fine sandalwood, wearing garlands,scents, and unguents, accepting gold and silver. Let the Blessed One teach theDhamma to us in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness both in thepresent life and in the future life as well.”“There are, Byagghapajja, four things that lead to the welfare and happiness ofa family man in this very life. What four? The accomplishment of persistenteffort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.“And what is the accomplishment of persistent effort? Here, Byagghapajja,whatever may be the means by which a family man earns his living—whether byfarming, trade, cattle raising, archery or civil service, or by some othercraft—he is skillful and diligent; he investigates the appropriate means, and isable to act and arrange everything properly. This is called the accomplishmentof persistent effort.“And what is the accomplishment of protection? Here, Byagghapajja, a family mansets up protection and guard over the wealth acquired by energetic striving,amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteouswealth righteously gained, thinking: ‘How can I prevent kings and bandits fromtaking this away, fire from burning it, floods from sweeping it off, and unlovedheirs from taking it?’ This is called the accomplishment of protection.“And what is good friendship? Here, Byagghapajja, in whatever village or town afamily man dwells, he associates with householders or their sons, whether youngor old, who are of mature virtue, accomplished in faith, moral discipline,generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions withthem. He emulates them in regard to their accomplishment in faith, moraldiscipline, generosity, and wisdom. This is called good friendship.“And what is balanced living? Here, Byagghapajja, a family man knows his incomeand expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither extravagant nor miserly, sothat his income exceeds his expenditures rather than the reverse. Just as agoldsmith or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows, ‘By so much it hasdipped down, by so much it has tilted up,’ so a family man leads a balancedlife.“The wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation: womanizing,drunkenness, gambling, and evil friendship. Just as in the case of a tank withfour inlets and outlets, if one should close the inlets and open the outlets,and there would not be adequate rainfall, a decrease rather than an increase ofthe water could be expected in the tank, so these four things bring about thedissipation of amassed wealth.“Similarly, there are four sources for the increase of amassed wealth:abstinence from womanizing, from drunkenness, from gambling, and from evilfriendship. Just as in the case of a tank with four inlets and outlets, if oneshould open the inlets and close the outlets, and there would be adequaterainfall, an increase rather than a decrease of the water could be expected inthe tank, so these four things bring about the increase of amassed wealth.“These four things, Byagghapajja, lead to a family man’s welfare and happinessin the present life.“Four other things lead to a family man’s welfare and happiness in the futurelife. What four? Accomplishment in faith, moral discipline, generosity, andwisdom.“And how is a family man accomplished in faith? Here, Byagghapajja, a family manhas faith; he places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata: ‘So theBlessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledgeand conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to betamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ Inthis way a family man is accomplished in faith.“And how is a family man accomplished in moral discipline? Here, Byagghapajja, afamily man abstains from the destruction of life, from stealing, from sexualmisconduct, from false speech, and from wines, liquors, and intoxicants, thebasis for negligence. In this way a family man is accomplished in moraldiscipline.“And how is a family man accomplished in generosity? Here, Byagghapajja, afamily man dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freelygenerous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity,delighting in giving and sharing. In this way a family man is accomplished ingenerosity.“And how is a family man accomplished in wisdom? Here, Byagghapajja, a familyman possesses the wisdom that sees into the arising and passing away ofphenomena, that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destructionof suffering. In this way a family man is accomplished in wisdom.“These four things, Byagghapajja, lead to a family man’s welfare and happinessin the future life.”(AN 8:54; IV 281–85)4. RIGHT LIVELIHOOD(1) AVOIDING WRONG LIVELIHOOD“These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: tradingin weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants,trading in poison.”(AN 5:177; III 208)(2) THE PROPER USE OF WEALTH[The Blessed One addressed the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:] “With the wealthacquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned bythe sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, the noble discipleundertakes four worthy deeds. What four?“With the wealth thus gained he makes himself happy and pleased and properlymaintains himself in happiness; he makes his parents happy and pleased andproperly maintains them in happiness; he makes his wife and children, hisslaves, workers, and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them inhappiness; he makes his friends and colleagues happy and pleased and properlymaintains them in happiness. This is the first case of wealth gone to good use,fruitfully applied and used for a worthy cause.“Further, householder, with the wealth thus gained the noble disciple makesprovisions against the losses that might arise on account of fire and floods,kings and bandits and unloved heirs; he makes himself secure against them. Thisis the second case of wealth gone to good use.…“Further, householder, with the wealth thus gained the noble disciple makes thefive kinds of offerings: to relatives, guests, ancestors, the king, and thedevas. This is the third case of wealth gone to good use.…“Further, householder, with the wealth thus gained the noble discipleestablishes a lofty offering of alms to those ascetics and brahmins who refrainfrom vanity and negligence, who are settled in patience and gentleness, who aredevoted to taming themselves, to calming themselves, and to attainingNibbāna—an offering that is heavenly, resulting in happiness, conducive toheaven. This is the fourth case of wealth gone to good use, fruitfully employedand used for a worthy cause.“These, householder, are the four worthy deeds that the noble discipleundertakes with the wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by thestrength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealthrighteously gained.“For anyone whose wealth is expended on other things apart from these fourworthy deeds, that wealth is said to have gone to waste, to have been squanderedand used frivolously. But for anyone whose wealth is expended on these fourworthy deeds, that wealth is said to have gone to good use, to have beenfruitfully employed and used for a worthy cause.”(AN 4:61; II 65–68)(3) A FAMILY MAN’S HAPPINESSThe Blessed One said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: “There are,householder, these four kinds of happiness which may be achieved by a laypersonwho enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. What four? Thehappiness of possession, the happiness of enjoyment, the happiness of freedomfrom debt, and the happiness of blamelessness.“And what, householder, is the happiness of possession? Here, a family manpossesses wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of hisarms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. Whenhe thinks, ‘I possess wealth acquired by energetic striving … righteouslygained,’ he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness ofpossession.“And what, householder, is the happiness of enjoyment? Here, with the wealthacquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned bythe sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a family man enjoyshis wealth and does meritorious deeds. When he thinks, ‘With the wealth acquiredby energetic striving … righteously gained, I enjoy my wealth and do meritoriousdeeds,’ he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness ofenjoyment.“And what, householder, is the happiness of freedom from debt? Here, a familyman is not indebted to anyone to any degree, whether small or great. When hethinks, ‘I am not indebted to anyone to any degree, whether small or great,’ heexperiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of freedom fromdebt.“And what, householder, is the happiness of blamelessness? Here, householder, anoble disciple is endowed with blameless conduct of body, speech, and mind. Whenhe thinks, ‘I am endowed with blameless conduct of body, speech, and mind,’ heexperiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of blamelessness.“These, householder, are the four kinds of happiness that a layperson who enjoyssensual pleasures may achieve, depending on time and occasion.”(AN 4:62; II 69–70)5. THE WOMAN OF THE HOMEOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park,in the Mansion of Migāra’s Mother. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, approachedthe Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.6[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en73] The Blessed One then said toher:“Visākhā, when a woman possesses four qualities she is heading for victory inthe present world and is successful in this world. What four?“Here, Visākhā, a woman is capable at her work; she manages her domestic help;she behaves in a way that is agreeable to her husband; and she safeguards hisearnings.“And how is a woman capable at her work? Here, Visākhā, she is skillful anddiligent in regard to her husband’s household chores, whether with wool orcotton; she investigates the appropriate means and is able to act and arrangeeverything properly. In this way a woman is capable at her work.“And how is a woman one who manages the domestic help? Here, Visākhā, inregard to her husband’s domestic helpers—slaves, servants, or workers—she knowsby direct inspection what they have done and failed to do; she knows when theyare sick and healthy; and she distributes to each the appropriate share of food.In this way a woman manages the domestic help.“And how does a woman behave in a way that is agreeable to her husband? Here,Visākhā, a woman would not commit any misdeed that her husband would considerdisagreeable, even at the cost of her life. In this way a woman behaves in a waythat is agreeable to her husband.“And how does a woman safeguard her husband’s earnings? Here, Visākhā,whatever her husband brings home—whether money or grain, silver or gold—shesucceeds in protecting and guarding it, and she is not a spendthrift, thief,wastrel, or squanderer of his wealth. In this way a woman safeguards herhusband’s earnings.“When, Visākhā, a woman possesses these four qualities, she is heading forvictory in the present world and is successful in this world. But when shepossesses four other qualities, she is heading for victory in the other worldand is successful in regard to the other world. What four?“Here, Visākhā, a woman is accomplished in faith, moral discipline,generosity, and wisdom.“And how is a woman accomplished in faith? Here, Visākhā, a woman has faith;she places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: ‘So the BlessedOne is an arahant ... [as in Text IV,3] … teacher of devas and humans, theEnlightened One, the Blessed One.’ In this way a woman is accomplished in faith.“And how is a woman accomplished in moral discipline? Here, Visākhā, a womanabstains from the destruction of life, from stealing, from sexual misconduct,from false speech, and from wines, liquors, and intoxicants, the basis fornegligence. In this way a woman is accomplished in moral discipline.“And how is a woman accomplished in generosity? Here, Visākhā, a woman dwellsat home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous,open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting ingiving and sharing. In this way a woman is accomplished in generosity.“And how is a woman accomplished in wisdom? Here, Visākhā, a woman possessesthe wisdom that sees into the arising and passing away of phenomena, that isnoble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.“When a woman possesses these four qualities, she is heading for victory in theother world and is successful in regard to the other world.”(AN 8:49; IV 269–71)6. THE COMMUNITY(1) SIX ROOTS OF DISPUTE6. “There are, Ānanda, these six roots of disputes. What six? Here, Ānanda, amonk is angry and resentful. Such a monk dwells without respect and deferencetoward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill thetraining. A monk who dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher,the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and who does not fulfill the training, creates adispute in the Saṅgha, which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, forthe loss, harm, and suffering of devas and humans. Now if you see any such rootof dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should strive to abandon thatsame evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of dispute eitherin yourselves or externally, you should practice in such a way that that sameevil root of dispute does not erupt in the future. Thus there is the abandoningof that evil root of dispute; thus there is the non-eruption of that evil rootof dispute in the future.7–11. “Again, a monk is contemptuous and insolent ... envious and niggardly …deceitful and fraudulent … has evil wishes and wrong view … adheres to his ownviews, holds on to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty. Sucha monk dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, andthe Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. A monk who dwells withoutrespect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and whodoes not fulfill the training, creates a dispute in the Saṅgha, which would befor the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and suffering of devasand humans. Now if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves orexternally, you should strive to abandon that same evil root of dispute. And ifyou do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, youshould practice in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not eruptin the future. Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute; thusthere is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute in the future. These arethe six roots of dispute.”(from MN 104: Sāmagāma Sutta; II 245–47)(2) SIX PRINCIPLES OF CORDIALITY21. “Ānanda, there are these six principles of cordiality that create love andrespect, and conduce to cohesion, nondispute, concord, and unity. What are thesix?“Here a monk maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness both in public and inprivate toward his companions in the holy life. This is a principle ofcordiality that creates love and respect, and conduces to cohesion, nondispute,concord, and unity.“Again, a monk maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness both in public and inprivate toward his companions in the holy life. This too is a principle ofcordiality that creates love and respect, and conduces to … unity.“Again, a monk maintains mental acts of loving-kindness both in public and inprivate toward his companions in the holy life. This too is a principle ofcordiality that creates love and respect, and conduces to … unity.“Again, a monk enjoys things in common with his virtuous companions in the holylife; without making reservations, he shares with them any righteous gain thathas been obtained in a righteous way, including even the mere content of hisalms bowl. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates love and respect,and conduces to … unity.“Again, a monk dwells both in public and in private possessing in common withhis companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken, untorn,unblemished, unmottled, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading toconcentration. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates love andrespect and conduces to … unity.“Again, a monk dwells both in public and in private possessing in common withhis companions in the holy life that view that is noble and emancipating, andleads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction ofsuffering. This too is a principle of cordiality that creates love and respect,and conduces to cohesion, to nondispute, to concord, and to unity.“These are the six principles of cordiality that create love and respect, andconduce to cohesion, to nondispute, to concord, and to unity.(from MN 104: Sāmagāma Sutta; II 250–51)(3) PURIFICATION IS FOR ALL FOUR CASTES1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were staying atSāvatthī for some business or other. Then those brahmins thought: “Thisascetic Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Who is there ableto dispute with him about this assertion?”3. Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalāyana was staying atSāvatthī. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of thethree Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and thehistories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed innatural philosophy and in the marks of a great man. So the brahmins thought hewould be able to debate with the Blessed One.4. They went to the brahmin student Assalāyana and said to him: “MasterAssalāyana, this ascetic Gotama describes purification for all the four castes.Let Master Assalāyana come and dispute with the ascetic Gotama about thisassertion.”When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana replied: “Sirs, the asceticGotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the Dhamma aredifficult to dispute with. I cannot dispute with the ascetic Gotama about thisassertion.”A second time and a third time the brahmins urged him to go. A second time thebrahmin student Assalāyana refused, but after the third urging he consented.5. Then the brahmin student Assalāyana went with a large number of brahmins tothe Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous andamiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:“Master Gotama, the brahmins say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste, those ofany other caste are inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any othercaste are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone arethe sons of Brahmā, the offspring of Brahmā, born of his mouth, born ofBrahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’ What does Master Gotama sayabout that?”“Now, Assalāyana, the brahmin women are seen having their periods, becomingpregnant, giving birth, and nursing.7[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en74] And yet those brahmins,though born from the womb, say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste ...brahmins alone are the sons of Brahmā, the offspring of Brahmā, born of hismouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’”6. “Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus: ‘Brahminsare the highest caste ... heirs of Brahmā.’”“What do you think, Assalāyana? Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en75] and in other outlandcountries there are only two castes, masters and slaves, and that masters becomeslaves and slaves become masters?”“So I have heard, sir.”“Then on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what [authority]do the brahmins in this case say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirsof Brahmā’?”7. “Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus: ‘Brahminsare the highest caste ... heirs of Brahmā.’”“What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose a khattiya were to kill living beings,take what is not given, commit sexual misconduct, speak falsely, speakmaliciously, speak harshly, gossip, be covetous, have a mind of ill will, andhold wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, would only he bereborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, inhell—and not a brahmin?

Whether it be a khattiya, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or aworker—those of all four castes who kill living beings … and hold wrong view,with the breakup of the body, after death, would be reborn in a state of misery,in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.”“Then on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what [authority]do the brahmins in this case say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirsof Brahmā’?”8. “Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus: ‘Brahminsare the highest caste ... heirs of Brahmā.’”“What do you think, Assalāyana?

And also let any who have been born into an outcast clan, a trapper clan,a wicker workers’ clan, a cartwrights’ clan, or a scavengers’ clan take an upperfire-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, from a pig’s trough, from adustbin, or from castor-oil wood and light a fire and produce heat.’“What do you think, Assalāyana? When a fire is lit and heat is produced bysomeone in the first group, would that fire have a flame, a color, and radiance,and would it be possible to use it for the purposes of fire, while when a fireis lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group, that fire would haveno flame, no color, and no radiance, and it would not be possible to use it forthe purposes of fire?”“No, Master Gotama. When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of thefirst group, that fire would have a flame, a color, and radiance, and it wouldbe possible to use it for the purposes of fire. And when a fire is lit and heatis produced by someone of the second group, that fire too would have a flame, acolor, and radiance, and it would be possible to use it for the purposes offire.

Suppose a brahmin youth here were to unitewith a khattiya girl, and a son were to be born from their union.

Should the foal be called ahorse after the mother or a donkey after the father?”“It is a mule, Master Gotama, since it does not belong to either kind. I see thedifference in this last case, but I see no difference in either of the formercases.”15. “What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose there were two brahmin students whowere brothers, born of the same mother, one studious and intelligent, and oneneither studious nor intelligent. Which of them would brahmins feed first at afuneral feast, or at a ceremonial offering, or at a sacrificial feast, or at afeast for guests?”“On such occasions, brahmins would feed first the one who was studious andintelligent, Master Gotama; for how could what is given to one who is neitherstudious nor intelligent bring great fruit?”16. “What do you think, Assalāyana?

Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Rājagaha on MountVulture Peak. Now just then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wanted toattack the Vajjians.9 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en76] Hesaid: “I will strike the Vajjians who are so powerful and strong, I will cutthem off and destroy them, I will bring them to ruin and destruction!”1.2. And King Ajātasattu said to his chief minister, the brahmin Vassakāra:“Brahmin, go to the Blessed One, worship him with your head to his feet in myname, ask if he is free from sickness or disease, if he is living at ease,vigorously and comfortably, and then say: ‘Lord, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta ofMagadha wishes to attack the Vajjians and says: “I will strike the Vajjians …bring them to ruin and destruction!”’ And whatever the Blessed One declares toyou, report that faithfully back to me, for Tathāgatas never lie.”1.3. “Very good, Sire,” said Vassakāra, and having had the state carriagesharnessed, he mounted one of them and drove in state from Rājagaha to Vultures’Peak, riding as far as the ground would allow, then continuing on foot to wherethe Blessed One was. He exchanged courtesies with the Blessed One, then sat downto one side and delivered the king’s message.1.4. Now the Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Blessed One, fanning him.And the Blessed One said:(1) “Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequentassemblies?”—“I have heard, venerable sir, that they do.”“Ānanda, as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies, they maybe expected to prosper and not decline.(2) “Have you heard that the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, andcarry on their business in harmony?”—“I have heard, venerable sir, that theydo.”“Ānanda, as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, andcarry on their business in harmony, they may be expected to prosper and notdecline.(3) “Have you heard that the Vajjians do not authorize what has not beenauthorized already, and do not abolish what has been authorized, but proceedaccording to what has been authorized by their ancient tradition?”—“I have,venerable sir.”… (4) “Have you heard that they honor, respect, revere, andsalute the elders among them, and consider them worth listening to?… (5) thatthey do not forcibly abduct others’ wives and daughters and compel them to livewith them?… (6) that they honor, respect, revere, and salute the Vajjian shrinesat home and abroad, not withdrawing the proper support made and given before?…(7) that proper provision is made for the safety of arahants, so that sucharahants may come in future to live there and those already there may dwell incomfort?”—“I have, Lord.”“Ānanda, so long as such proper provision is made ... the Vajjians may beexpected to prosper and not decline.”1.5. Then the Lord said to the brahmin Vassakāra: “Once, brahmin, when I was atthe Sārandada Shrine in Vesāli, I taught the Vajjians these seven principlesfor preventing decline, and as long as they keep to these seven principles, aslong as these principles remain in force, the Vajjians may be expected toprosper and not decline.”At this, Vassakāra replied: “Master Gotama, if the Vajjians keep to even one ofthese principles, they may be expected to prosper and not decline—far less allseven. Certainly the Vajjians will never be conquered by King Ajātasattu byforce of arms, but only by means of propaganda and setting them against oneanother. And now, Master Gotama, I must depart. I am busy and have much to do.”“Brahmin, do as you think fit.” Then Vassakāra, rejoicing and delighted at theBlessed One’s words, rose from his seat and departed.1.6. Soon after Vassakāra had gone, the Blessed One said: “Ānanda, go towhatever monks there are living around Rājagaha, and summon them to theassembly hall.”“Yes, venerable sir,” said Ānanda, and he did so. Then he came to the BlessedOne, saluted him, stood to one side, and said: “Venerable sir, the Saṅgha ofmonks is assembled. Now is the time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit.”Then the Blessed One rose from his seat, went to the assembly hall, sat down onthe prepared seat, and said: “Monks, I will teach you seven things that areconducive to welfare. Listen, pay careful attention, and I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” said the monks, and the Blessed One said:“As long as the monks hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may be expectedto prosper and not decline. As long as they meet in harmony, break up inharmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they may be expected to prosperand not decline. As long as they do not authorize what has not been authorizedalready, and do not abolish what has been authorized, but proceed according towhat has been authorized by the rules of training…; as long as they honor,respect, revere, and salute the elders of long standing who are long ordained,fathers and leaders of the order…; as long as they do not fall prey to thecraving that arises in them and leads to rebirth…; as long as they are devotedto forest-lodgings…; as long as they preserve their mindfulness regarding thebody, so that in future the good among their companions will come to them, andthose who have already come will feel at ease with them…; as long as the monkshold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be expected toprosper and not decline.”(from DN 16: Mahāparinibbāna Sutta; II 72–77)(5) THE WHEEL-TURNING MONARCH3. “And, after many hundreds and thousands of years, King Daḷhanemi said to acertain man: ‘My good man, whenever you see that the sacred wheel-treasure hasslipped from its position, report it to me.’ ‘Yes, Sire,’ the man replied. Andafter many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacredwheel-treasure had slipped from its position. Seeing this, he reported the factto the king. Then King Daḷhanemi sent for his eldest son, the crown prince, andsaid: ‘My son, the sacred wheel-treasure has slipped from its position. And Ihave heard say that when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he has notmuch longer to live. I have had my fill of human pleasures, now is the time toseek heavenly pleasures. You, my son, take over control of this land. I willshave off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and go forth from the householdlife into homelessness.’ And, having installed his eldest son in due form asking, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, andwent forth from the household life into homelessness. And, seven days after theroyal sage had gone forth, the sacred wheel-treasure vanished.4. “Then a certain man came to the consecrated khattiya king and said: ‘Sire,you should know that the sacred wheel-treasure has disappeared. ’ At this theking was grieved and felt sad. He went to the royal sage and told him the news.And the royal sage said to him: ‘My son, you should not grieve or feel sad atthe disappearance of the wheel-treasure. The wheel-treasure is not an heirloomfrom your fathers. But now, my son, you must turn yourself into a noblewheel-turner. And then it may come about that, if you perform the duties of anoble wheel-turning monarch, on the uposatha day of the fifteenth,10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en77] when you have washed yourhead and gone up to the verandah on top of your palace for the uposatha day, thesacred wheel-treasure will appear to you, thousand-spoked, complete with rim,hub, and all accessories.’5. “‘But what, Sire, is the duty of a noble wheel-turning monarch?’—‘It is this,my son: Yourself depending on the Dhamma, honoring it, revering it, cherishingit, doing homage to it, and venerating it, having the Dhamma as your badge andbanner, acknowledging the Dhamma as your master, you should establish righteousguard, ward, and protection for your own household, your troops, your khattiyasand vassals, for brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics andbrahmins, for beasts and birds. Let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and tothose who are in need, give wealth. And whatever ascetics and brahmins in yourkingdom have renounced the life of sensual infatuation and are devoted toforbearance and gentleness, each one taming himself, each one calming himself,and each one striving for the end of craving, from time to time you shouldapproach them and ask: “What, venerable sirs, is wholesome and what isunwholesome, what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what is to be followedand what is not to be followed? What action will in the long run lead to harmand sorrow, and what to welfare and happiness?”11[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en78] Having listened to them, youshould avoid what is unwholesome and do what is wholesome. That, my son, is theduty of a noble wheel-turning monarch.’ “‘Yes, Sire,’ said the king, and heperformed the duties of a noble wheel-turning monarch. And as he did so, on theuposatha day of the fifteenth, when he had washed his head and gone up to theverandah on top of his palace for the uposatha day, the sacred wheel-treasureappeared to him, thousand-spoked, complete with rim, hub, and all accessories.Then the king thought: ‘I have heard that when a duly anointed khattiya kingsees such a wheel on the uposatha day of the fifteenth, he will become awheel-turning monarch. May I become such a monarch?’6. “Then, rising from his seat, covering one shoulder with his robe, the kingtook a gold vessel in his left hand, sprinkled the wheel with his right hand,and said: ‘May the noble wheel-treasure turn, may the noble wheel-treasureconquer!’ The wheel turned to the east, and the king followed it with hisfourfold army. And in whatever country the wheel stopped, the king took upresidence with his fourfold army. And those who opposed him in the easternregion came and said: ‘Come, Your Majesty, welcome. We are yours, Your Majesty.Rule us, Your Majesty.’ And the king said: ‘Do not take life. Do not take whatis not given. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drinkintoxicating drinks. Enjoy your possessions as before.’12[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en79] And those who had opposedhim in the eastern region became his subjects.7. “Then the wheel turned south, west, and north ... [as section 6] ... Then thewheel-treasure, having conquered the lands from sea to sea, returned to theroyal capital and stopped before the king’s palace as he was trying a case, asif to adorn the royal palace.”(from DN 26: Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta; III 59–63)(6) BRINGING TRANQUILLITY TO THE LAND9. Sitting to one side, the brahmin Kūṭadanta addressed the Blessed One:“Master Gotama, I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully thetriple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. Now I do not understand all this,but I want to make a big sacrifice. It would be good if Master Gotama wouldexplain this to me.”“Then listen, brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain.”“Yes, sir,” replied Kūṭadanta, and the Blessed One continued:10. “Brahmin, once upon a time there was a king called Mahāvijita. He was rich,of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold and silver, ofpossessions and requisites, of money and money’s worth, with a full treasury andgranary. And when King Mahāvijita was reflecting in private, the thought cameto him: ‘I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms, I occupy a wide extentof land which I have conquered. Let me now make a great sacrifice that would beto my benefit and happiness for a long time.’ And calling his chaplain,13[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_004.html#en80] he told him his thought. ‘Iwant to make a great sacrifice. Instruct me, venerable sir, how this may be tomy lasting benefit and happiness.’11. “The chaplain replied: ‘Your Majesty’s country is beset by thieves. It isravaged; villages and towns are being destroyed; the countryside is infestedwith brigands. If Your Majesty were to tax this region, that would be the wrongthing to do. Suppose Your Majesty were to think: “I will get rid of this plagueof robbers by executions and imprisonment, or by confiscation, threats, andbanishment,” the plague would not be properly ended. Those who survived wouldlater harm Your Majesty’s realm. However, with this plan you can completelyeliminate the plague. To those in the kingdom who are engaged in cultivatingcrops and raising cattle, let Your Majesty distribute grain and fodder; to thosein trade, give capital; to those in government service assign proper livingwages. Then those people, being intent on their own occupations, will not harmthe kingdom. Your Majesty’s revenues will be great; the land will be tranquiland not beset by thieves; and the people, with joy in their hearts, playing withtheir children, will dwell in open houses.’ “And saying: ‘So be it!,’ the kingaccepted the chaplain’s advice: he gave grain and fodder to those engaged incultivating crops and raising cattle, capital to those in trade, proper livingwages to those in government service. Then those people, being intent on theirown occupations, did not harm the kingdom. The king’s revenues became great; theland was tranquil and not beset by thieves; and the people, with joy in theirhearts, playing with their children, dwelled in open houses.”(from DN 5: Kūṭadanta Sutta; I 134–36)"},{"pageContent":"V. The Way to a Fortunate Rebirth010 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_010_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONIn his account of his “noble quest,” the Buddha says that when he gazed out uponthe world soon after his enlightenment, he saw that sentient beings are likelotus flowers at various stages of growth within a pond (see p. 71). While somebeings are like lotuses at or near the surface of the pond, capable of awakeningmerely by being exposed to his world-transcending teachings, the vast majorityof people who encounter the Dhamma are like the lotuses growing deep below thesurface. These lotuses benefit from the sunlight and use its energy to sustaintheir life, yet still need time to reach the surface and blossom. So too, thegreat multitude of people who hear the Buddha’s teachings and establish faithmust still nurture their wholesome qualities with the radiant energy of theDhamma before their mindstreams become mature enough to attain directrealization. This process ordinarily requires many lives, and thus such peoplehave to take a long-term approach to their spiritual development. Whilepracticing the way to liberation, they must avoid a rebirth in the unfortunaterealms and win successive rebirths blessed with material security, happiness,and opportunities for further spiritual progress.These benefits, the enhancing conditions for spiritual development in theDhamma, come about by the acquisition of puñña or “merit,” a word that signifiesthe capacity of wholesome action to yield beneficial results within the cycle ofrebirths. According to the Buddha’s teaching, the cosmos, with its many realmsof sentient existence, is governed at all levels by immutable laws, physical,biological, psychological, and ethical. The process by which sentient beingsmigrate from one state of existence to another is likewise lawful. It isregulated by a law that works in two principal ways: first, it connects ouractions with a particular realm of rebirth that corresponds to our actions; andsecond, it determines the relations between our actions and the quality of ourexperience within the particular realm into which we have been reborn.The governing factor in this process, the factor that makes the entire process alawful one, is a force called kamma (Skt: karma). The word “kamma” literallymeans action, but technically it refers to volitional action. As the Buddhasays: “It is volition (cetanā) that I call kamma; for having willed(cetayitvā), one acts by body, speech, and mind.”1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en81] Kamma thus denotes deedsthat originate from volition. Such volition may remain purely mental, generatingmental kamma that occurs as thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may come toexpression outwardly through manifest bodily and verbal actions.It may seem that our deeds, once performed, perish and vanish without leavingbehind any traces apart from their visible impact on other people and ourenvironment. However, according to the Buddha, all morally determinatevolitional actions create a potential to bring forth results (vipāka) or fruits(phala) that correspond to the ethical quality of those actions. This capacityof our deeds to produce the morally appropriate results is what is meant bykamma. Our deeds generate kamma, a potential to produce fruits that correspondto their own intrinsic tendencies. Then, when internal and external conditionsare suitable, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits. In ripening,the kamma rebounds upon us for good or for harm depending on the moral qualityof the original action. This may happen either later in the same life in whichthe action was done, in the next life, or in some distant future life.2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en82] The one thing that iscertain is that as long as we remain within saṃsāra any stored-up kamma ofours will be capable of ripening so long as it has not yet produced its dueresults.On the basis of its ethical quality, the Buddha distinguishes kamma into twomajor categories: the unwholesome (akusala) and the wholesome (kusala).Unwholesome kamma is action that is spiritually detrimental to the agent,morally reprehensible, and potentially productive of an unfortunate rebirth andpainful results. The criterion for judging an action to be unwholesome is itsunderlying motives, the “roots” from which it springs. There are threeunwholesome roots: greed, hatred, and delusion. From these there arises a widevariety of secondary defilements—states such as anger, hostility, envy,selfishness, arrogance, pride, presumption, and laziness—and from the rootdefilements and secondary defilements arise defiled actions.Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that is spiritually beneficial andmorally commendable; it is action that ripens in happiness and good fortune. Itsunderlying motives are the three wholesome roots: nongreed, nonhatred, andnondelusion, which may be expressed more positively as generosity,loving-kindness, and wisdom. Whereas actions springing from the unwholesomeroots are necessarily bound to the world of repeated birth and death, actionsspringing from the wholesome roots may be of two kinds, mundane andworld-transcending. The mundane (lokiya) wholesome actions have the potential toproduce a fortunate rebirth and pleasant results within the round of rebirths.The world-transcending or supramundane (lokuttara) wholesome actions—namely, thekamma generated by developing the Noble Eightfold Path and the other aids toenlightenment—lead to enlightenment and to liberation from the round ofrebirths. This is the kamma that dismantles the entire process of karmiccausation.The correlation between kamma and its results is indicated in a general way inText V,1(1). This sutta refers to unwholesome action as “dark kamma” and mundanewholesome action as “bright kamma.” It also refers to a type of kamma that isboth dark and bright. Strictly speaking, this does not denote a single actionthat simultaneously partakes of both unwholesome and wholesome characteristics;technically such a thing is impossible, for an action must be one or the other.The combined kamma refers to the conduct of a person who intermittently engagesin both unwholesome and wholesome behavior. Finally, the sutta speaks of afourth type of kamma that is neither dark nor bright. This is the action ofdeveloping the Noble Eightfold Path, the wholesome world-transcending kamma.It cannot be emphasized strongly enough that for Early Buddhism an understandingand acceptance of this principle of kamma and its fruit is an essentialcomponent of right view. Right view has two aspects, the world-bound or mundaneaspect, which pertains to life within the world, and the supramundane orworld-transcending aspect, which pertains to the path to liberation.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en83] The world-transcending rightview includes an understanding of the Four Noble Truths, dependent origination,and the three marks of impermanence, suffering, and nonself. For Early Buddhismthis world-transcending right view cannot be taken up in isolation from mundaneright view. Rather, it presupposes and depends upon the sound support of mundaneright view, which means a firm conviction in the validity of the law of kammaand its unfolding through the process of rebirths.To accept the law of kamma entails a radical transformation in our understandingof our relationship to the world. The twin doctrines of kamma and rebirth enableus to see that the world in which we live is, in important respects, an externalreflection of the internal cosmos of the mind. This does not mean that theexternal world can be reduced to a mental projection in the way proposed bycertain types of philosophical idealism. However, taken in conjunction, thesetwo doctrines do show that the conditions under which we live closely correspondto the karmic tendencies of our minds. The reason why a living being is reborninto a particular realm is because in a previous life that being has generatedthe kamma, or volitional action, that leads to rebirth into that realm. Thus, inthe final analysis, all the realms of existence have been formed, fashioned, andsustained by the mental activity of living beings. As the Buddha says: “Forbeings obstructed by ignorance and hindered by craving, kamma is the field,consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture, for consciousness to beestablished in a new realm of existence—either inferior, middling, or superior”(AN 3:76; I 223).4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en84]The next selection, Text V,1(2), draws a finer distinction among the types ofunwholesome and wholesome kamma. The text enumerates ten primary instances ofeach class. Here they are called respectively “unrighteous conduct, conduct notin accordance with the Dhamma” and “righteous conduct, conduct in accordancewith the Dhamma” but they are usually known as the ten pathways of unwholesomeand wholesome kamma.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en85] Theten are subdivided by way of the three “doors of action”—body, speech, and mind.Taking the unwholesome first, there are three kinds of bodily misconduct:killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; four kinds of verbal misconduct:lying, malicious speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter (or gossip); and threekinds of mental misconduct: covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. The tencourses of wholesome action are their exact opposites: abstinence from the threekinds of bodily misconduct; abstinence from the four kinds of verbal misconduct;and noncovetousness, goodwill, and right view. According to the sutta, the tentypes of unwholesome kamma are the reason that beings are reborn in the baddestinations after death; the ten types of wholesome kamma are the reason thatbeings are reborn in the good destinations after death. As the sutta shows, theten types of wholesome kamma are the support, not only for a heavenly rebirth,but also for “the destruction of the taints,” the attainment of liberation.The concluding paragraphs of this sutta give us a brief survey of Buddhistcosmology. The Buddhist cosmos is divided into three broad realms—thesense-sphere realm (kāmadhātu), the form realm (rūpadh̄tu ), and the formlessrealm (arūpadhātu)—each comprising a range of subsidiary planes.The sense-sphere realm, our realm, is so called because the beings reborn hereare strongly driven by sensual desire. The realm is divided into two levels, thebad destinations and the good destinations. The bad destinations or “states ofmisery” (apāya) are three in number: the hells, states of intense torment (seeMN 129 and 130, not included in this anthology); the animal kingdom; and thesphere of spirits (pettivisaya ), beings afflicted with incessant hunger,thirst, and other sufferings. These are the realms of retribution for the tenunwholesome paths of kamma.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en86]The good destinations in the sense-sphere realm are the human world and the sixsensual heavenly planes. The latter are: the devas in the heaven of the FourGreat Kings, who are presided over by four powerful devas (namely, the FourGreat Kings); the Tāvatiṃsa devas presided over by Sakka, a devotee of theBuddha who is faithful but prone to negligence (see the Sakkasaṃyutta, SNchapter 11); the Yāma devas; the devas of the Tusita heaven, the abode of abodhisatta before his final birth; the Nimmānaratī devas (“the gods whodelight in creating”); and the Paranimmitavasavattī devas (“the gods whocontrol what is created by others”). The karmic cause for rebirth into the gooddestinations of the sense-sphere realm is the practice of the ten courses ofwholesome action.In the form realm the grosser types of material form are absent. Its denizens,known as brahmās, enjoy bliss, power, luminosity, and vitality far superior tothe beings in the sense-sphere realm. The form realm consists of sixteen planes.These are the objective counterparts of the four jhānas. Attainment of thefirst jhāna leads to rebirth among Brahmā’s assembly, the ministers ofBrahmā, and the Mahābrahmās, according to whether it is developed to aninferior, middling, or superior degree. The second jhāna, attained in the samethree degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among the devas of limitedradiance, of measureless radiance, and of streaming radiance. The third jhāna,attained in the same three degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among thedevas of limited glory, of measureless glory, and of refulgent glory. The fourthjhāna ordinarily leads to rebirth among the devas of great fruit, but ifdeveloped with a feeling of disgust for perception, it will conduce to rebirthamong the “nonpercipient beings,” beings who lack perception. The form realmalso comprises five planes reserved exclusively for the rebirth of nonreturners(see pp. 379–80), called the pure abodes: aviha, atappa, sudassa, sudassī, andakaniṭṭha. In each of the subtle form planes, the lifespan is said to be ofenormous duration and to increase significantly with each higher plane.7[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en87]In the third realm of existence, material form is nonexistent and bare mentalprocesses exist; hence it is called the formless realm. This realm consists offour planes, which are the objective counterparts of the four formlessmeditative attainments, after which they are named: the base of the infinity ofspace, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, andthe base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception. The lifespans ascribed tothese realms are respectively 20,000; 40,000; 60,000; and 84,000 great eons.(For the duration of one eon, see Text I,4(3).)For Buddhist cosmology, existence in every realm, being the product of a kammawith a finite potency, is necessarily impermanent. Beings take rebirth into arealm appropriate for their kamma or deeds, experience the good or bad results,and then, when the generative kamma has spent its force, they pass away to takerebirth elsewhere as determined by still another kamma that has found theopportunity to ripen. Hence the torments of hell as well as the joys of heaven,no matter how long they may last, are bound to pass. The Buddha guides thosewhose spiritual faculties are still tender to aspire for a human or heavenlyrebirth and teaches them the lines of conduct that conduce to the fulfillment oftheir aspirations. But he urges those with mature faculties to make a determinedeffort to put an end to the aimless wandering of saṃsāra and reach theDeathless, Nibbāna, which transcends all conditioned planes of being.While the first two texts in this chapter establish a general correlationbetween kamma and spheres of rebirth, Text V,1(3) specifies the underlyingkarmic causes for the manifest differences in human life. It does so withreference to a well-known saying of the Buddha: “Beings are owners of theirkamma, heirs of their kamma; they originate from their kamma, are bound to theirkamma, have their kamma as their refuge. It is kamma that distinguishes beingsas inferior and superior.” The sutta proposes to explain this statement withregard to seven pairs of contrasting qualities observed among people. This textalso introduces a distinction between two types of consequences that anunwholesome kamma can have: the more powerful is rebirth in a bad destination;the other is unpleasant fruits within the human state, for example, a shortlifespan for one who in an earlier life killed living beings. An analogousdistinction obtains among the consequences that a wholesome kamma can have: themore powerful is rebirth in a heavenly world; the other is pleasant fruitswithin the human state.The next section deals with merit (puñña), wholesome kamma capable of yieldingfavorable results within the cycle of rebirths. Merit produces mundane benefits,such as a good rebirth, wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as anenhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stagesalong the path to enlightenment. Hence, as seen in Text V,2(1), the Buddha urgeshis disciples to cultivate merit, referring to his own cultivation of merit overmany previous lives as an example.The Nikāyas concisely organize the types of merit into three “bases ofmeritorious deeds” (puññakiriyavatthu): giving, moral discipline, andmeditation. Text V,2(2) connects the bases of merit with the types of rebirth towhich they lead. In the Indian religious context, the practice of meritoriousdeeds revolves around faith in certain objects regarded as sacred andspiritually empowering, capable of serving as a support for the acquisition ofmerit. For followers of the Buddha’s teaching these are the Three Jewels: theBuddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Text V,2(3) extols these as each supreme inits particular sphere: the Buddha is supreme among persons, the Dhamma amongteachings, and the Saṅgha among religious communities. The text proposes aninteresting twofold distinction of the Dhamma Jewel: among all conditionedthings (dhammā saṅkhatā), the Noble Eightfold Path is supreme; among allthings conditioned or unconditioned (dhamm̄ saṅkhatā vā asaṅkhatā vā),Nibbāna is supreme. Merely having confidence in the Three Jewels, that is,reverential trust and devotion toward them, is itself a basis of merit; but asthe verses attached to the sutta make clear, the Buddha and the Saṅghaadditionally function as the recipients of gifts, and in this role they furtherenable donors to acquire merit leading to the fulfillment of their virtuouswishes. More will be said about this aspect of merit just below.The following sections of this chapter elaborate on the three bases of meritindividually, beginning in section 3 with giving or generosity (dāna). TheBuddha often treated giving as the most rudimentary virtue of the spirituallife, for giving serves to break down the egocentric frame of mind on the basisof which we habitually interact with others. Contrary to what a Western readermight expect, however, “giving” for Early Buddhism does not mean simplyphilanthropic charity directed toward the poor and disadvantaged. While itincludes this, the practice of giving has a more context-specific meaning rootedin the social structure of Indian religiosity. In India during the Buddha’stime, those who sought to fathom the deepest truths of existence and attainrelease from the round of birth and death usually renounced home and family,relinquished their secure place in the cohesive Indian social order, and adoptedthe precarious life of the homeless wanderer. With shaved heads or matted locks,clad in ochre or white robes or going naked, they would move from place to placewithout fixed abode, except during the three months of the rainy season, whenthey would settle in simple huts, caves, or other lodgings. Such homelesswanderers, known as samaṇas (“ascetics”) or paribbājakas (“wanderers”), didnot perform any remunerative services but depended upon the charity ofhouseholders for their livelihood. The lay devotees provided them with theirmaterial requisites—robes, food, lodgings, and medicines—doing so in theconfidence that such services were a source of merit that would help themadvance a few steps farther in the direction of final emancipation.When the Buddha appeared on the scene, he adopted this mode of life for himself.Once he commenced his work as a spiritual teacher, he established his Saṅgha onthe same principle: the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, the monks and nuns, woulddepend on the charity of others for their material support, and they wouldreciprocate by offering their donors the more precious gift of the Dhamma, theteaching of the lofty path that leads to happiness, peace, and final liberation.Text V,3(5) testifies to this principle of mutual support. By accepting thegifts of lay people, the monastics give them the opportunity to acquire merit.Since the volume of merit generated by the act of giving is considered to beproportional to the worthiness of the recipient, when the recipients are theBuddha and those following in his footsteps, the merit becomes immeasurable (seeMN 142, not included in this anthology). For this reason, the sāvakasaṅgha,the spiritual community of noble disciples, is called “the unsurpassed field ofmerit for the world” (anuttaraṃ puññakhettạ lokassa).8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en88] Gifts to the Saṅgha, it issaid, conduce to great blessings; they lead to one’s welfare and happiness for along time and can bring rebirth in the heavenly worlds. But as Text V,3(6)reminds us, this is true “only for the morally pure, not for the immoral.”This leads to the next base of merit, “moral discipline” (sīla), which forEarly Buddhism requires the undertaking of precepts. The most basic moralguidelines inculcated in the Nikāyas are the five precepts, the training rulesto abstain from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and theuse of intoxicants. These are mentioned in Text V,4(1), which, by an interestingtwist in terminology, speaks of them as “pristine, traditional, ancient gifts,”thus implicitly subsuming sīla under dāna. The reason the observance ofprecepts is a form of giving is because one who undertakes precepts will be“giving to immeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression,”and as a karmic consequence “he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom fromfear, hostility, and oppression.”While the Buddha enjoins observance of the five precepts upon lay followers as afull-time obligation, he recommends a more stringent type of moral practice forthe uposatha, the observance days determined by the lunar calendar: thefull-moon day, the new-moon day, and the two half-moon days. (Of the four, inBuddhist countries today it is the full-moon day that is given priority.) Onthese occasions, devout lay Buddhists undertake eight precepts: the usual five,but with the third changed to complete sexual abstinence, augmented by threeother precepts that emulate the training rules of a novice monk or nun. Theeight precepts, enumerated in Text V,4(2), augment the training in sīla as amoral observance with a training in self-restraint, simplicity, and contentment.In this respect they prepare the disciple for the training of the mindundertaken in the practice of meditation, the third base of merit.The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to liberation but asource of merit in its own right. Wholesome meditation practices, even thosethat do not directly lead to insight, help to purify the grosser levels ofmental defilement and uncover deeper dimensions of the mind’s potential purityand radiance. Text V,5(1) declares that the type of meditation that is mostfruitful for the production of mundane merit is the development ofloving-kindness (mettābhāvanā). The practice of loving-kindness, however, isonly one among a set of four meditations called the “divine abodes”(brahmavih̄ra) or “immeasurable states” (appamaññ̄): the development ofloving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity, which are to beextended boundlessly to all sentient beings. Briefly, loving-kindness (mett̄) isthe wish for the welfare and happiness of all beings; compassion (karuṇā), thefeeling of empathy for all those afflicted with suffering; altruistic joy(muditā), the feeling of happiness at the success and good fortune of others;and equanimity (upekkh̄), a balanced reaction to joy and misery, which protectsone from emotional agitation.These meditations are said to be the means to rebirth in the brahma world; seeText V,5(2). While the brahmins regarded the brahma world as the highestattainment, for the Buddha it was just one exalted sphere of rebirth. Theconcentration arisen from these meditations, however, can also be used as abasis for cultivating the wisdom of insight, and insight culminates inliberation. Text V,5(3), the last selection of this chapter, thus grades thedifferent types of merit according to their fruits: from giving (with thevarious kinds of gifts ranked according to the spiritual status of therecipients) through the going for refuge and the five precepts to the meditationon loving-kindness. Then, at the very end, it declares that the most fruitfuldeed among them all is the perception of impermanence. The perception ofimpermanence, however, belongs to a different order. It is so fruitful notbecause it yields pleasant mundane results within the round of rebirths, butbecause it leads to the wisdom of insight that cuts the chains of bondage andbrings the realization of complete emancipation, Nibbāna.V. THE WAY TO A FORTUNATE REBIRTH1. THE LAW OF KAMMA(1) FOUR KINDS OF KAMMA“There are, O monks, these four kinds of kamma declared by me after I hadrealized them for myself by direct knowledge. What four?“There is dark kamma with dark results; there is bright kamma with brightresults; there is kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright results;there is kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither dark nor brightresults, which leads to the destruction of kamma.“And what, monks, is dark kamma with dark results? Here, monks, someonegenerates an afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Havingdone so, he is reborn in an afflictive world. When he is reborn in an afflictiveworld, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, heexperiences an afflictive feeling, extremely painful, as for example the beingsin hell experience. This is called dark kamma with dark results.“And what, monks, is bright kamma with bright results? Here, monks, someonegenerates a non-afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Havingdone so, he is reborn in a non-afflictive world. When he is reborn in anon-afflictive world, non-afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched bynon-afflictive contacts, he experiences a non-afflictive feeling, extremelypleasant, as for example the devas of refulgent glory experience.9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en89] This is called bright kammawith bright results.“And what, monks, is dark and bright kamma with dark and bright results? Here,monks, someone generates both an afflictive volitional formation of body,speech, or mind and a non-afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, ormind. Having done so, he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive andnon-afflictive. When he is reborn in such a world, both afflictive andnon-afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by such contacts, heexperiences both an afflictive feeling and a non-afflictive feeling, a mixtureand conglomeration of pleasure and pain, as for example human beings and somedevas and some beings in the lower world experience. This is called dark andbright kamma with dark and bright results.“And what, monks, is kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither darknor bright results, which leads to the destruction of kamma? The volition toabandon this dark kamma with dark results, and to abandon the bright kamma withbright results, and to abandon the dark and bright kamma with dark and brightresults—this is called the kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neitherdark nor bright results, which leads to the destruction of kamma.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en90]“These, monks, are the four kinds of kamma declared by me after I had realizedthem for myself by direct knowledge.”(AN 4:232; II 230–32)(2) WHY BEINGS FARE AS THEY DO AFTER DEATH1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering by stages inthe Kosalan country with a large Saṅgha of monks, and eventually he arrived ata Kosalan brahmin village named Sālā.2. The brahmin householders of Sālā heard: “It is said that the asceticGotama, the Sakyan son who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering inthe Kosalan country with a large Saṅgha of monks and has come to Sālā. Now agood report of Master Gotama has been circulating thus: ‘That Blessed One is anarahant ... [as in Text III,2] … that is perfectly complete and purified.’ Nowit is good to see such arahants.”3. Then the brahmin householders of Sālā went to the Blessed One. Some paidhomage to him and sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with him and,after their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side; some saluted himreverentially and sat down to one side; some remained silent and sat down to oneside.4. When they were seated, they said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, what isthe cause and condition why some beings here, on the breakup of the body, afterdeath, are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lowerworld, in hell? And what is the cause and condition why some beings here, on thebreakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in aheavenly world?”5. “Householders, it is by reason of unrighteous conduct, conduct not inaccordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body,after death, are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lowerworld, in hell. It is by reason of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance withthe Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body, after death, arereborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”6. “We do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama’s statement,which he has spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning. It wouldbe good if Master Gotama would teach us the Dhamma so that we might understandthe detailed meaning of his statement.”“Then, householders, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:7. “Householders, there are three kinds of unrighteous bodily conduct, conductnot in accordance with the Dhamma. There are four kinds of unrighteous verbalconduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma. There are three kinds ofunrighteous mental conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma.8. “And how, householders, are there three kinds of unrighteous bodily conduct,conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone kills living beings; heis murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to livingbeings. He takes what is not given; he takes by way of theft the wealth andproperty of others in the village or forest. He commits sexual misconduct; hehas intercourse with women who are protected by their mother, father, mother andfather, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband, who are protected bylaw, and even with those already engaged. That is how there are three kinds ofunrighteous bodily conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma.9. “And how, householders, are there four kinds of unrighteous verbal conduct,conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone speaks falsehood; whensummoned to a court, or to a meeting, or to his relatives’ presence, or to hisguild, or to the royal family’s presence, and questioned as a witness thus: ‘So,good man, tell what you know,’ not knowing, he says, ‘I know,’ or knowing, hesays, ‘I do not know’; not seeing, he says, ‘I see,’ or seeing, he says, ‘I donot see’; in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends, or foranother’s ends, or for some trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously; herepeats elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] fromthese, or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order todivide [these people] from those; thus he is one who divides those who areunited, a creator of divisions, who enjoys discord, rejoices in discord,delights in discord, a speaker of words that create discord. He speaks harshly;he utters such words as are rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others,bordering on anger, not conducive to concentration. He engages in idle chatter;he speaks at the wrong time, speaks what is not fact, speaks what is useless,speaks contrary to the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the wrong time he speakssuch words as are worthless, unreasonable, immoderate, and unbeneficial. That ishow there are four kinds of unrighteous verbal conduct, conduct not inaccordance with the Dhamma.10. “And how, householders, are there three kinds of unrighteous mental conduct,conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone is covetous; he covetsthe wealth and property of others thus: ‘Oh, may what belongs to another bemine!’ Or he has a mind of ill will and intentions of hate thus: ‘May thesebeings be slain and slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or beannihilated!’ Or he has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: ‘There is nothinggiven, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and badactions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who arereborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous ascetics and brahmins in the worldwho have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declare this world and theother world.’11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en91] That is howthere are three kinds of unrighteous mental conduct, conduct not in accordancewith the Dhamma. So, householders, it is by reason of such unrighteous conduct,such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here on thebreakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, in a baddestination, in the lower world, in hell.11. “Householders, there are three kinds of righteous bodily conduct, conduct inaccordance with the Dhamma. There are four kinds of righteous verbal conduct,conduct in accordance with the Dhamma. There are three kinds of righteous mentalconduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma.12. “And how, householders, are there three kinds of righteous bodily conduct,conduct in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone, abandoning the destructionof life, abstains from the destruction of life; with rod and weapon laid aside,conscientious, merciful, he dwells compassionate to all living beings.Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is notgiven; he does not take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in thevillage or in the forest. Abandoning sexual misconduct, he abstains from sexualmisconduct; he does not have intercourse with women who are protected by theirmother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have ahusband, who are protected by law, or with those already engaged. That is howthere are three kinds of righteous bodily conduct, conduct in accordance withthe Dhamma.13. “And how, householders, are there four kinds of righteous verbal conduct,conduct in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone, abandoning false speech,abstains from false speech; when summoned to a court, or to a meeting, or to hisrelatives’ presence, or to his guild, or to the royal family’s presence, andquestioned as a witness thus: ‘So, good man, tell what you know,’ not knowing,he says, ‘I do not know,’ or knowing, he says, ‘I know’; not seeing, he says, ‘Ido not see,’ or seeing, he says, ‘I see’; he does not in full awareness speakfalsehood for his own ends, or for another’s ends, or for some trifling worldlyend. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech; he does notrepeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] fromthese, nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere in orderto divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who aredivided, a promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord,delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harshspeech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle,pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired bymany, and agreeable to many. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idlechatter; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what isgood, speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks suchwords as are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial. That is howthere are four kinds of righteous verbal conduct, conduct in accordance with theDhamma.14. “And how, householders, are there three kinds of righteous mental conduct,conduct in accordance with the Dhamma? Here someone is not covetous; he does notcovet the wealth and property of others thus: ‘Oh, may what belongs to anotherbe mine!’ His mind is without ill will, and he has intentions free from hatethus: ‘May these beings be free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety! May theylive happily!’ He has right view, undistorted vision, thus: ‘There is what isgiven and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result ofgood and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is motherand father; there are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are good andvirtuous ascetics and brahmins in the world who have themselves realized bydirect knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ That is how thereare three kinds of righteous mental conduct, conduct in accordance with theDhamma. So, householders, it is by reason of such righteous conduct, suchconduct in accordance with the Dhamma that some beings here, on the breakup ofthe body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, even in a heavenlyworld.15. “If, householders, one who observes righteous conduct, conduct in accordancewith the Dhamma, should wish: ‘Oh, that on the breakup of the body, after death,may I be reborn in the company of well-to-do nobles!’ it is possible that, onthe breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the company ofwell-to-do nobles. Why is that? Because he observes righteous conduct, conductin accordance with the Dhamma.16–17. “If, householders, one who observes righteous conduct, conduct inaccordance with the Dhamma, should wish: ‘Oh, that on the breakup of the body,after death, may I be reborn in the company of well-to-do brahmins!… in thecompany of well-to-do householders!’ it is possible that, on the breakup of thebody, after death, he will be reborn in the company of well-to-do householders.Why is that? Because he observes righteous conduct, conduct in accordance withthe Dhamma.18–42. “If, householders, one who observes righteous conduct, conduct inaccordance with the Dhamma, should wish: ‘Oh, that on the breakup of the body,after death, may I be reborn in the company of the devas of the realm of theFour Great Kings!… in the company of the Tāvatiṃsa devas … the Yāma devas …the Tusita devas … the devas who delight in creating … the devas who wield powerover others’ creations … the devas of Brahmā’s company ... the devas ofradiance12 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en92] ... the devas oflimited radiance ... the devas of immeasurable radiance … the devas of streamingradiance … the devas of glory … the devas of limited glory … the devas ofimmeasurable glory ... the devas of refulgent glory ... the devas of great fruit... the aviha devas ... the atappa devas ... the sudassa devas … the sudassīdevas … the akaniṭṭha devas … the devas of the base of the infinity of space... the devas of the base of the infinity of consciousness … the devas of thebase of nothingness … the devas of the base ofneither-perception-nor-non-perception!’ it is possible that on the breakup ofthe body, after death, he will be reborn in the company of the devas of the baseof neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Why is that? Because he observesrighteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma.43. “If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,righteous conduct, should wish: ‘Oh, by realizing it for myself with directknowledge, may I in this very life enter upon and dwell in the liberation ofmind, liberation by wisdom, that is taintless with the destruction of thetaints!’ it is possible that, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge,in this very life he will enter upon and dwell in the liberation of mind,liberation by wisdom, that is taintless with the destruction of the taints. Whyis that? Because he observes righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with theDhamma.”13 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en93]44. When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sālā said to the BlessedOne: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama hasmade the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what hadbeen overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost,or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms.We now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha ofmonks. Let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who have gone for refugefrom today until life’s end.”(MN 41: Sāleyyaka Sutta; I 286–90)(3) KAMMA AND ITS FRUITS1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, went to the Blessed One andexchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished,he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:3. “Master Gotama, why is it that human beings are seen to be inferior andsuperior? For people are seen to be short-lived and long-lived, sickly andhealthy, ugly and beautiful, without influence and influential, poor andwealthy, low born and high born, stupid and wise. Why is it, Master Gotama, thathuman beings are seen to be inferior and superior?”4. “Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions; theyoriginate from their actions, are bound to their actions, have their actions astheir refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior.”“I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama’s statement, whichhe spoke in brief without expounding the meaning in detail. It would be good ifMaster Gotama would teach me the Dhamma so that I might understand in detail themeaning of his statement.”“Then, student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, sir,” Subha replied. The Blessed One said this:5. “Here, student, some man or woman kills living beings and is murderous,bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. Becauseof performing and undertaking such action, on the breakup of the body, afterdeath, he is reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lowerworld, in hell. But if on the breakup of the body, after death, he is not rebornin a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell, butinstead comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he isshort-lived.14 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en94] This is theway, student, that leads to short life, namely, one kills living beings and ismurderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to livingbeings.6. “But here, student, some man or woman, abandoning the destruction of life,abstains from the destruction of life; with rod and weapon laid aside,conscientious, merciful, he dwells compassionate to all living beings. Becauseof performing and undertaking such action, on the breakup of the body, afterdeath, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. But if on thebreakup of the body, after death, he is not reborn in a good destination, in aheavenly world, but instead comes back to the human state, then wherever he isreborn he is long-lived. 15 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en95]This is the way, student, that leads to long life, namely, abandoning thedestruction of life, one abstains from the destruction of life; with rod andweapon laid aside, conscientious, merciful, one dwells compassionate to allliving beings.7. “Here, student, some man or woman is given to injuring beings with the hand,with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife. Because of performing andundertaking such action, on the breakup of the body, after death, he is rebornin a state of misery.… But if instead he comes back to the human state, thenwherever he is reborn he is sickly. This is the way, student, that leads tosickliness, namely, one is given to injuring beings with the hand, with a clod,with a stick, or with a knife.8. “But here, student, some man or woman is not given to injuring beings withthe hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife.

This is the way, student, that leads tohealth, namely, one is not given to injuring beings with the hand, with a clod,with a stick, or with a knife.9. “Here, student, some man or woman is of an angry and irritable character;even when criticized a little, he is offended, becomes angry, hostile, andresentful, and displays anger, hate, and bitterness. Because of performing andundertaking such action ... he is reborn in a state of misery.… But if insteadhe comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is ugly.

It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior.”21. When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, said to theBlessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!… [as inpreceding text] … Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has gone forrefuge from today until life’s end.”(MN 135: Cūḷakammavibhaṅga Sutta; III 202–6)2. MERIT: THE KEY TO GOOD FORTUNE(1) MERITORIOUS DEEDS“Monks, do not fear meritorious deeds. This is an expression denoting happiness,what is desirable, wished for, dear, and agreeable, that is, meritorious deeds.For I know full well, monks, that for a long time I experienced desirable,wished for, dear, and agreeable results from often performing meritorious deeds.“Having cultivated for seven years a mind of loving-kindness, for seven eons ofcontraction and expansion I did not return to this world. Whenever the eoncontracted I reached the plane of streaming radiance, and when the eon expandedI arose in an empty divine mansion. And there I was Brahmā, the great Brahmā,the unvanquished victor, the all-seeing, the all-powerful. Thirty-six times Iwas Sakka, ruler of the devas. And many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turningmonarch, righteous, a king of righteousness, conqueror of the four regions ofthe earth, maintaining stability in the land, in possession of the seventreasures. What need is there to speak of mere local kingship?“It occurred to me, monks, to wonder: ‘Of what kind of deed of mine is this thefruit? Of what deed’s ripening am I now of such great accomplishment and power?’And then it occurred to me: ‘It is the fruit of three kinds of deeds of mine,the ripening of three kinds of deeds that I am now of such great accomplishmentand power: deeds of giving, of self-mastery, and of refraining.’”(It 22; 14–15)(2) THREE BASES OF MERIT“There are, O monks, three ways of making merit. What three? There are ways ofmaking merit by giving, by moral discipline, and by the development ofmeditation.“There is a person who has practiced the making of merit by giving only to alimited degree; and, likewise to a limited degree, he has practiced the makingof merit by moral discipline; but he has not undertaken the making of merit bymeditation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn amonghumans in an unfavorable condition.“Another person has practiced the making of merit by giving as well as by moraldiscipline to a high degree; but he has not undertaken the making of merit bymeditation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he will be reborn amonghumans in a favorable condition.“Or he will be reborn in the company of the devas of the Four Great Kings. Andthere, the Four Great Kings, who had practiced to a very high degree the makingof merit by giving and by moral discipline, surpass the devas of their realm inten respects: in divine lifespan, divine beauty, divine happiness, divine fame,divine power; and in divine sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.“Or he will be reborn in the company of the Tāvatiṃsa devas. And there, Sakka,ruler of the devas, who had practiced the making of merit by giving and by moraldiscipline to a very high degree, surpasses the devas of their realm in tenrespects: in divine lifespan, divine beauty, divine happiness, divine fame,divine power; and in divine sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.[Similar statements are made for rebirth among the Yāma devas, Tusita devas,the devas who delight in creating, the devas who wield power over others’creations, and for the respective rulers of these realms.]“These, monks, are the three ways of making merit.”(AN 8:36; IV 241–43)(3) THE BEST KINDS OF CONFIDENCE“Monks, there are these four best kinds of confidence. What four?“To whatever extent there are beings, whether footless or with two feet, fourfeet, or many feet, whether having form or formless, whether percipient,non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathāgata, theArahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the best among them. Thosewho have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best, and for those whohave confidence in the best, the result is best.“To whatever extent there are things that are conditioned, the Noble EightfoldPath is declared the best among them. Those who have confidence in the NobleEightfold Path have confidence in the best, and for those who have confidence inthe best, the result is best.“To whatever extent there are things whether conditioned or unconditioned,dispassion is declared the best among them, that is, the crushing of pride, theremoval of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the termination of the round,the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna. Those who haveconfidence in the Dhamma have confidence in the best, and for those who haveconfidence in the best, the result is best.“To whatever extent there are communities or groups, the Tathāgata’s Saṅgha ofdisciples is declared the best among them, that is, the four pairs of persons,the eight types of individuals—this Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples isworthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy ofreverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Those whohave confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best, and for those whohave confidence in the best, the result is best.”For those who have confidence as the best,For those who understand the best Dhamma,For those who have confidence in the Buddha,The unsurpassed one worthy of offerings;For those who have confidence in the Dhamma,In blissful dispassion, perfect peace;For those who have confidence in the Saṅgha,The field of merit unsurpassed;For those giving gifts to the best,The best kind of merit increases:The best lifespan, beauty, and fame,Good reputation, happiness, and strength.Whether he becomes a deva or a human being,The wise one who gives of the best,Concentrated upon the best Dhamma,Rejoices when he has attained to the best.(AN 4:34; II 34–35)3. GIVING(1) IF PEOPLE KNEW THE RESULT OF GIVING“O monks, if people knew, as I know, the result of giving and sharing, theywould not eat without having given, nor would they allow the stain ofniggardliness to obsess them and take root in their minds. Even if it were theirlast morsel, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared it,if there were someone to share it with. But, monks, as people do not know, as Iknow, the result of giving and sharing, they eat without having given, and thestain of niggardliness obsesses them and takes root in their minds.”(It 26; 18–19)(2) REASONS FOR GIVING“There are, O monks, eight reasons for giving. What eight? People may give outof affection; or in an angry mood; or out of stupidity; or out of fear; or withthe thought: ‘Such gifts have been given before by my father and grandfather andit was done by them before; hence it would be unworthy of me to give up this oldfamily tradition’; or with the thought, ‘By giving this gift, I shall be rebornin a good destination, in a heavenly world, after death’; or with the thought,‘When giving this gift, my heart will be glad, and happiness and joy will arisein me’; or one gives because it ennobles and adorns the mind.”(AN 8:33; IV 236–37)(3) THE GIFT OF FOODOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans, at a towncalled Sajjanela. One morning the Blessed One dressed, took his upper robe andbowl, and went to the dwelling of Suppavāsā, a Koliyan lady. Having arrivedthere, he sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Koliyan lady Suppavāsāattended to the Blessed One personally and served him with various kinds ofdelicious food. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had withdrawn hishand from the bowl, the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā sat down to one side, and theBlessed One addressed her as follows:“Suppavāsā, a noble female disciple, by giving food, gives four things tothose who receive it. What four? She gives long life, beauty, happiness, andstrength. By giving long life, she herself will be endowed with long life, humanor divine. By giving beauty, she herself will be endowed with beauty, human ordivine. By giving happiness, she herself will be endowed with happiness, humanor divine. By giving strength, she herself will be endowed with strength, humanor divine. A noble female disciple, by giving food, gives those four things tothose who receive it.”(AN 4:57; II 62–63)(4) A SUPERIOR PERSON’S GIFTS“There are, O monks, these five gifts of a superior person. What five?“He gives a gift out of faith; he gives a gift respectfully; he gives a gift atthe right time; he gives a gift with a generous heart; he gives a gift withoutdenigration.“Because he gives a gift out of faith, wherever the result of that gift ripenshe becomes rich, affluent, and wealthy, and he is handsome, comely, graceful,endowed with supreme beauty of complexion.“Because he gives a gift respectfully, wherever the result of that gift ripenshe becomes rich, affluent, and wealthy, and his children and wives, his slaves,messengers, and workers are obedient, lend their ears to him, and apply theirminds to understand him.“Because he gives a gift at the right time, wherever the result of that giftripens he becomes rich, affluent, and wealthy, and benefits come to him at theright time, in abundant measure.“Because he gives a gift with a generous heart, wherever the result of that giftripens he becomes rich, affluent, and wealthy, and his mind inclines to theenjoyment of excellent things among the five cords of sensual pleasure.“Because he gives a gift without denigrating himself and others, wherever theresult of that gift ripens he becomes rich, affluent, and wealthy, and no lossof his wealth takes place from any quarter, whether from fire, floods, the king,bandits, or unloved heirs.“These, monks, are the five gifts of a superior person.”(AN 5:148; III 172–73)(5) MUTUAL SUPPORT“Monks, brahmins and householders are very helpful to you. They provide you withthe requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines in time of sickness.And you, monks, are very helpful to brahmins and householders, as you teach themthe Dhamma that is good in the beginning, the middle, and the end, with thecorrect meaning and wording, and you proclaim the spiritual life in itsfulfillment and complete purity. Thus, monks, this spiritual life is lived withmutual support for the purpose of crossing the flood and making a complete endof suffering.”(It 107; 111)(6) REBIRTH ON ACCOUNT OF GIVING“There are, O monks, eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving. What eight?“Here, monks, a certain person makes a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin, offeringhim food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents;bedding, lodging, and lighting. In making the gift, he hopes for a reward. Henow notices affluent nobles, brahmins, or householders enjoying themselvesprovided and furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure, and he thinks:‘Oh, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn among them!’ Andhe sets his mind on that thought, keeps to it firmly, and fosters it. Thisthought of his aims at what is low, and if not developed to what is higher itwill lead him to just such a rebirth. With the breakup of the body, after death,he will be reborn among affluent nobles, brahmins, or householders. This,however, I declare only for the morally pure, not for the immoral; for it is dueto his purity, monks, that the heart’s desire of the morally pure succeeds.16[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en96]“Then again, a certain person makes a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin, offeringhim food ... or lighting. In making the gift, he hopes for a reward. He nowhears of the long life, the beauty, and the great happiness of the devas in therealm of the Four Great Kings ... the Tāvatiṃsa devas … the Yāma devas … theTusita devas … the devas who delight in creating … the devas who wield powerover others’ creations, and he wishes to be reborn among them. He sets his mindon that thought, keeps to it firmly, and fosters it. This thought of his aims atwhat is low, and if not developed to what is higher, it will lead him to justsuch a rebirth. After his death, when his body breaks up, he will be rebornamong the devas in the realm of the Four Great Kings ... or among the devas whowield power over others’ creations. This, however, I declare only for themorally pure, not for the immoral; for it is due to his purity, monks, that theheart’s desire of the morally pure succeeds.“Then again, a certain person makes a gift to an ascetic or a brahmin, offeringhim food ... or lighting. He now hears of the long life, the beauty, and thegreat happiness of the devas of Brahmā’s company, and he wishes to be rebornamong them. He sets his mind on that thought, keeps to it firmly, and fostersit. This thought of his aims at what is low, and if not developed to what ishigher, it will lead him to just such a rebirth. After his death, when his bodybreaks up, he will be reborn among the devas of Brahmā’s company. This,however, I declare only for the morally pure, not for the immoral; only for onefree of lust, not for one who is lustful.17[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en97] Because he is without lust,monks, the heart’s desire of the morally pure succeeds.“These, monks, are the eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving.”(AN 8:35; IV 239–41)4. MORAL DISCIPLINE(1) THE FIVE PRECEPTS“There are, O monks, eight streams of merit, streams of the wholesome,nourishments of happiness, that are heavenly, ripening in happiness, conduciveto heaven, and that lead to whatever is wished for, loved, and agreeable, toone’s welfare and happiness. What are the eight? “Here, monks, a noble disciplehas gone for refuge to the Buddha.This is the first stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nourishment ofhappiness, that is heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven, andthat leads to whatever is wished for, loved, and agreeable, to one’s welfare andhappiness.“Further, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Dhamma. This is the secondstream of merit ... that leads to whatever is wished for, loved, and agreeable,to one’s welfare and happiness.“Further, a noble disciple has gone for refuge to the Saṅgha. This is the thirdstream of merit ... that leads to whatever is wished for, loved, and agreeable,to one’s welfare and happiness.“There are further, monks, these five gifts—pristine, of long standing,traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated, that are notbeing adulterated and that will not be adulterated, not despised by wiseascetics and brahmins. What are these five gifts?“Here, monks, a noble disciple gives up the destruction of life and abstainsfrom it. By abstaining from the destruction of life, the noble disciple gives toimmeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression. By giving toimmeasurable beings freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression, he himselfwill enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, hostility, and oppression. This isthe first of those great gifts and the fourth stream of merit.“Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up the taking of what is not given andabstains from it. By abstaining from taking what is not given, the nobledisciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear.… This is the second ofthose great gifts and the fifth stream of merit.“Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up sexual misconduct and abstains fromit. By abstaining from sexual misconduct, the noble disciple gives toimmeasurable beings freedom from fear.… This is the third of those great giftsand the sixth stream of merit.“Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up false speech and abstains from it. Byabstaining from false speech, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beingsfreedom from fear.… This is the fourth of those great gifts and the seventhstream of merit.“Further, monks, a noble disciple gives up wines, liquors, and intoxicants, thebasis for negligence, and abstains from them. By abstaining from wines, liquors,and intoxicants, the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom fromfear, hostility, and oppression. By giving to immeasurable beings freedom fromfear, hostility, and oppression, he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom fromfear, hostility, and oppression. This is the fifth of those great gifts and theeighth stream of merit.“These, monks, are the eight streams of merit, streams of the wholesome,nourishments of happiness, which are heavenly, ripening in happiness, conduciveto heaven, and which lead to whatever is wished for, loved, and agreeable, toone’s welfare and happiness.”(AN 8:39; IV 245–47)(2) THE UPOSATHA OBSERVANCE“When, O monks, the uposatha observance is complete in eight factors, it is ofgreat fruit and benefit, luminous and pervasive. And how is the uposathaobservance complete in eight factors?18[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en98]“Here, monks, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘As long as they live the arahantsabandon the destruction of life, abstain from the destruction of life; with therod and weapon laid aside, they are conscientious and merciful and dwellcompassionate toward all living beings. Today I too, for this day and night,will do likewise. I will imitate the arahants in this respect, and the uposathaobservance will be fulfilled by me.’ This is the first factor it possesses.“Further, he reflects: ‘As long as they live the arahants abandon the taking ofwhat is not given, abstain from taking what is not given; they accept only whatis given, expect only what is given, and dwell with honest hearts devoid oftheft. Today I too, for this day and night, will do likewise.…’ This is thesecond factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon sexual relations and observecelibacy, living apart, refraining from the coarse practice of sexualintercourse. Today I too, for this day and night, will do likewise. …’ This isthe third factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon false speech, abstain from falsespeech; they are speakers of truth, adherents of truth, trustworthy andreliable, no deceivers of the world. Today I too, for this day and night, willdo likewise.…’ This is the fourth factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon wines, liquors, and intoxicants, thebasis of negligence, and abstain from them. Today I too, for this day and night,will do likewise.…’ This is the fifth factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants eat only one meal a day and refrain fromeating at night, outside the proper time.19[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en99] Today I too, for this dayand night, will do likewise.…’ This is the sixth factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, instrumentalmusic, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning themselves by wearing garlandsand applying scents and ointments. Today I too, for this day and night, will dolikewise.…’ This is the seventh factor it possesses.“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon the use of high and luxurious bedsand seats and abstain from using them; they make use of low resting places,either small beds or straw mats. Today I too, for this day and night, will dolikewise. I will imitate the arahants in this respect, and the uposathaobservance will be fulfilled by me.’ This is the eighth factor it possesses.“When, monks, the uposatha observance is complete in these eight factors, it isof great fruit and benefit, luminous and pervasive. And to what extent is it ofgreat fruit and benefit, luminous and pervasive?“Suppose, monks, someone were to exercise sovereignty and dominion over thesesixteen great countries abounding in the seven precious treasures, that is,Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, the Vajjis, the Mallas, the Cetis, Vaṃsa, theKurus, the Pañcālas, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka,Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja:20[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en100] this would not be worth asixteenth part of the uposatha observance complete in those eight factors. Forwhat reason? Because human kingship is poor compared to divine happiness.“For the devas in the realm of the Four Great Kings a single day and night isequivalent to fifty human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelvesuch months make up a year. The lifespan of the devas in the realm of the FourGreat Kings is five hundred such celestial years. It is possible, monks, that ifsome man or woman here observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors,with the breakup of the body, after death, they will be reborn in the company ofthe devas in the realm of the Four Great Kings. It was with reference to thisthat I said human kingship is poor compared to divine happiness.“For the Tāvatiṃsa devas a single day and night is equivalent to a hundredhuman years.… The lifespan of the Tāvatiṃsa devas is a thousand such celestialyears…. For the Yāma devas a single day and night is equivalent to two hundredhuman years.… The lifespan of the Yāma devas is two thousand such celestialyears…. For the Tusita devas, a single day and night is equivalent to fourhundred human years.… The lifespan of the Tusita devas is four thousand suchcelestial years…. For the devas who delight in creating, a single day and nightis equivalent to eight hundred human years.… The lifespan of the devas whodelight in creating is eight thousand such celestial years…. For the devas whowield power over others’ creations a single day and night is equivalent tosixteen hundred human years; thirty such days make up a month, and twelve suchmonths make up a year. The lifespan of the devas who wield power over others’creations is sixteen thousand celestial years. It is possible, monks, that ifsome man or woman here observes the uposatha complete in these eight factors,with the breakup of the body, after death, they will be reborn in the company ofthe devas who wield power over others’ creations. It was with reference to thisthat I said human kingship is poor compared to divine happiness.”(AN 8:41; IV 248–51)5. MEDITATION(1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOVING-KINDNESS“Monks, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a futurebirth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind byloving-kindness. The liberation of mind by loving-kindness surpasses them andshines forth, bright and brilliant.“Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a sixteenth part of themoon’s radiance, but the moon’s radiance surpasses them and shines forth, brightand brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making merit productiveof a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation ofmind by loving-kindness. The liberation of mind by loving-kindness surpassesthem and shines forth, bright and brilliant.“Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when the sky isclear and free of clouds, the sun, on ascending, dispels the darkness of spaceand shines forth, bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are formaking merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenthpart of the liberation of mind by loving-kindness. The liberation of mind byloving-kindness surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.“And just as in the night, at the moment of dawn, the morning star shines forth,bright and brilliant, even so, whatever grounds there are for making meritproductive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of theliberation of mind by loving-kindness. The liberation of mind by loving-kindnesssurpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.”(It 27; 19–21)(2) THE FOUR DIVINE ABODES22. The brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, said to the Blessed One: “MasterGotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama knows the path to the company ofBrahmā.”“What do you think, student? Is the village of Naḷakāra near here, not farfrom here?”“Yes, sir, the village of Naḷakāra is near here, not far from here.”“What do you think, student? Suppose there was a man born and raised in thevillage of Naḷakāra, and as soon as he had left Naḷakāra they asked himabout the path to the village. Would that man be slow or hesitant in answering?”“No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that man has been born and raised inNaḷakāra, and is well acquainted with all the paths to the village.”“Still, a man born and raised in the village of Naḷakāra might be slow orhesitant in answering when asked about the path to the village, but aTathāgata, when asked about the brahma world or the way leading to the brahmaworld, would never be slow or hesitant in answering. I understand Brahmā, and Iunderstand the brahma world, and I understand the way leading to the brahmaworld, and I understand how one should practice to be reborn in the brahmaworld.”23. “Master Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama teaches the path to thecompany of Brahmā. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the path tothe company of Brahmā.”“Then, student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, sir,” he replied. The Blessed One said this:24. “What, student, is the path to the company of Brahmā? Here a monk dwellspervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise thesecond, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, andeverywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the all-encompassingworld with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,without hostility, and without ill will. When the liberation of mind byloving-kindness is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, nonepersists there. Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard withoutdifficulty in the four quarters, so too, when the liberation of mind byloving-kindness is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, nonepersists there.21 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en101] This isthe path to the company of Brahmā.25–27. “Again, a monk dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued withcompassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued withequanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; soabove, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwellspervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity,abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will.

Just as a vigorous trumpeter couldmake himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters, so too, when theliberation of mind by equanimity is developed in this way, no limiting actionremains there, none persists there. This too is the path to the company ofBrahmā.”(from MN 99: Subha Sutta; II 206–8)(3) INSIGHT SURPASSES ALL[The Buddha said to Anāthapiṇḍika:] “In the past, householder, there was abrahmin named Velāma. He gave such a great alms offering as this: eighty-fourthousand bowls of gold filled with silver; eighty-four thousand bowls of silverfilled with gold; eighty-four thousand bronze bowls filled with bullion;eighty-four thousand elephants, chariots, milch cows, maidens, and couches, manymillions of fine cloths, and indescribable amounts of food, drink, ointment, andbedding.“As great as was the alms offering that the brahmin Velāma gave, it would beeven more fruitful if one would feed a single person possessed of right view.22[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en102] As great as the brahminVelāma’s alms offering was, and though one would feed a hundred personspossessed of right view, it would be even more fruitful if one would feed asingle once-returner. As great as the brahmin Velāma’s alms offering was, andthough one would feed a hundred once-returners, it would be even more fruitfulif one would feed a single nonreturner. As great as the brahmin Velāma’s almsoffering was, and though one would feed a hundred nonreturners, it would be evenmore fruitful if one would feed a single arahant. As great as the brahminVelāma’s alms offering was, and though one would feed a hundred arahants, itwould be even more fruitful if one would feed a single paccekabuddha.23[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_005.html#en103] As great as the brahminVelāma’s alms offering was, and though one would feed a hundred paccekabuddhas,it would be even more fruitful if one would feed a single Perfectly EnlightenedBuddha ... it would be even more fruitful if one would feed the Saṅgha of monksheaded by the Buddha and build a monastery for the sake of the Saṅgha of thefour quarters … it would be even more fruitful if, with a trusting mind, onewould go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and wouldundertake the five precepts: abstaining from the destruction of life, fromtaking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and fromthe use of intoxicants. As great as all this might be, it would be even morefruitful if one would develop a mind of loving-kindness even for the time ittakes to pull a cow’s udder. And as great as all this might be, it would be evenmore fruitful still if one would develop the perception of impermanence just forthe time it takes to snap one’s fingers.”(AN 9:20, abridged; IV 393–96)"},{"pageContent":"VI. Deepening One’s Perspective on the World011 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_011_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONIn interpreting suttas, we have to take account of the circumstances under whichthey were spoken and the persons to whom they were addressed. During the courseof his long ministry, the Buddha had to adjust his teaching to people withdifferent capacities and needs. He taught those given to reckless behavior toabandon their self-defeating ways and engage in wholesome actions that yieldpleasant fruits. He taught those inclined to resign themselves to fate thatpresent effort determines our present quality of life as well as our futuredestiny. He taught those convinced that personal existence ceases with bodilydeath that living beings survive the breakup of the body and re-arise inaccordance with their kamma. He taught those not yet ripe enough for higherattainments to aspire for rebirth among the devas, the celestial beings, and toenjoy the bliss and glory of the heavens.A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which theBuddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. Theultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, nomatter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering. According tothe Buddha’s teaching, all states of existence within the round of rebirths,even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus theultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means totalrelease from the round of birth and death.What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state calledNibbāna. Nibbāna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attainedwithin conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as theextinction of suffering. The Buddha realized Nibbāna through his enlightenment,and for the next forty-five years of his life he endeavored to help othersrealize it for themselves. The realization of Nibbāna comes with the blossomingof wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling ofthe mind’s compulsive drives. Nibbāna is the destruction of thirst, the thirstof craving. It is also the island of safety amid the raging currents of old age,sickness, and death.To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward Nibbāna, the Buddha had tosteer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life byperforming wholesome deeds. He did so through the “world-transcending” facets ofhis teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the “triple world”of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence. Againand again throughout the discourses, the Buddha offered an uncompromising,razor-sharp exposure of the dangers inherent in all conditioned states of being.He sounded a clear warning signal that all states of existence are perilous andfraught with pain. He insisted, unambiguously, that the one hope of lastingsecurity lies in complete purification and liberation of the mind. He presenteda path that cuts through ignorance and craving in their entirety and dispelsattachment even to the most refined states of meditative absorption.In his “graduated discourse on the Dhamma,” given to introduce receptivenewcomers to his teaching, the Buddha regularly began by discussing suchpractices as giving and moral discipline. He would extol the beauty of suchvirtues as generosity, harmlessness, honesty, and self-restraint, explaining howsuch meritorious deeds lead to the joys of a heavenly rebirth. At this point, hewould reveal “the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures andthe blessings of renunciation.” Having thus gradually “ripened” the minds of hisaudience, he would next expound the doctrine distinctive of his own teaching,the Four Noble Truths: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Whenthe Buddha himself taught the Four Noble Truths, his purpose was not to give hislisteners an introductory course in “basic Buddhism,” but to awaken in them the“vision of the Dhamma,” the first direct realization of the transcendent truththat sets the disciple on the irreversible path to liberation.Though we sometimes read in the suttas that disciples attained their firstexperience of awakening merely by listening to the Buddha preach, this does notmean that the Dhamma is easy to understand. Such disciples could penetrate thetruth with such apparent ease because their faculties were mature, perhaps toobecause they had accumulated sufficient supporting conditions from previouslives. But by its very nature, the world-transcending Dhamma goes against thegrain of the mundane mind. The Buddha describes the Dhamma as “subtle, deep, anddifficult to see,” and one of the things that makes it so difficult to see isits thesis that the highest happiness cannot be won by yielding to the longingsof the heart but only by subduing them. This thesis runs utterly counter to thethought, attitudes, and actions of people fully immersed in the world. As longas we are infatuated with the seductive lures of sensual enjoyment, as long aswe take delight in being this or becoming that, we will regard the sublimeDhamma as a mystery and a puzzle. The Buddha therefore realized that the firstmajor challenge he would face in establishing his world-transcending Dhamma wasto break the grip that sensual pleasure and worldly attachment have upon themind. He had to knock the mind out of its accustomed ruts and set it moving inan altogether different direction. He had to steer his disciples away from thelures of sensuality and worldly attachment and guide them toward disenchantment,complete dispassion, and awakening.The requirements of this task drew upon all the Buddha’s skills as a teacher. Itdemanded that he make ample use of his ability to precisely adjust his teachingto the mental proclivities of the people who came to him for instruction. Itdemanded that he speak up frankly and candidly, even when candor bredresentment. It demanded that he enter the fray of debate, even though he muchpreferred the peace of seclusion. It demanded that he use similes, metaphors,and parables whenever concrete illustrations could give his arguments strongerappeal. It demanded that he uphold his principles strongly whether hisadversaries were hostile ascetics or miscreant monks within the ranks of his ownorder (see the opening sections of MN 22 and MN 38, not included in thisanthology). That the Buddha succeeded so well in fulfilling this difficult taskis counted among his truly wonderful and marvelous accomplishments. This is apoint to which Text VI,1 bears eloquent testimony.The Buddha’s task at this stage in the unfolding of his doctrine is to impart tous a radically new education in the art of seeing. To follow the Buddha in thedirection he wants to lead us, we have to learn to see beneath the surfaceglitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at thesame time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception,thought, and views that habitually cloak our vision. Ordinarily, we representthings to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases. Thesebiases are shaped by our craving and attachments, which they in turn reinforce.We see things that we want to see; we blot out things that threaten or disturbus, that shake our complacency, that throw into question our comfortingassumptions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process involves acommitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run provesexhilarating and liberating.The education that the Buddha imparts to us brings about a deepening of ourperspective on the world. To help us transform our understanding and deepen ourperspective on the world, he offers us three standpoints from which we canappraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints alsorepresent three “moments” or steps in an unfolding process of insight thatstarts from our common-sense attitudes and moves strategically toward higherknowledge, enlightenment, and release. The three moments are: gratification(ass̄da), danger (ādīnava), and escape (nissarạa). In Texts VI,2(1)–(3), thisscheme is applied to the world as a whole. Elsewhere in the Nikāyas, the schemeis applied more specifically to the four material elements (SN 14:31–33), thefive aggregates (SN 22:26–28), and the six internal and external sense bases (SN35:13–18). The Buddha underscores the importance of this scheme with the boldpronouncement that until he was able to fully evaluate the world (or, in thetexts referred to just above, the elements, aggregates, and sense bases) in thisway, he did not claim that he had attained the unsurpassed perfectenlightenment.In advancing systematically through this scheme, one begins by recognizing theindubitable fact that such worldly phenomena as sense objects, forms, andfeelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists inthe pleasure and joy (sukha-somanassa) we experience when we succeed infulfilling our desires. Once we acknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeperby asking whether such pleasure and joy are entirely satisfactory. If we addressthis question with utter honesty, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we willrealize that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory. To the contrary,they are saddled with drawbacks and defects ranging from the trifling to thecatastrophic, defects that we perpetually hide from ourselves so that we cancontinue unhindered in our quest for gratification. This is their danger, thesecond moment or step of observation. The most pervasive danger lurking behindthe innocent façade of our worldly pleasures is their inherent nature of beingimpermanent (anicca), bound up with suffering and discontent (dukkha), andsubject to inevitable change and decay (vipariṇāmadhamma).The third moment, the moment of escape, follows from the second. “Escape” hereis not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’sproblems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. Trueescape is quite the opposite: the sanest, most rational, most judicious courseof action we can take when we accurately recognize a genuine danger. It is oursearch for an exit from a burning building, our visit to the doctor when we’rebeset by a persistent fever, our decision to give up smoking when we understandhow it jeopardizes our health. Once we see that the objects of our attachmentare flawed, beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way of escapelies in dropping our attachment to them. This is “the removal of desire andlust, the abandoning of desire and lust” (chandar̄ga-vinaya,chandarāga-pahāna) referred to in the texts.The Pāli commentators, not surprisingly, connect these three moments with theFour Noble Truths. “Gratification” implies the second noble truth, for pleasureand joy arouse craving, the origin of suffering. “Danger” is the truth ofsuffering itself. And “escape” is the truth of the cessation of suffering, whichalso implies the Noble Eightfold Path, the fourth truth, the way to thecessation of suffering.In Text VI,3 the Buddha uses this threefold scheme to make a detailed appraisalof three major objects of attachment: sensual pleasures, bodily form, andfeelings. The major portion of the sutta is devoted to an examination of thedangers in sensual pleasures. It begins with a close-up view of the tribulationsthat a “clansman”—a young householder pursuing the ancient Indian counterpart ofa professional career—might undergo in his quest for sensual gratification. Asthe discourse unfolds, the scope of the examination widens from the personal tothe collective, encompassing the broader social and political consequences ofthis quest. It reaches its climax in striking images of the warfare and humandevastation that follow from the frenzied mass drive for sensual gratification.“Form” is the physical body. The Buddha begins his treatment of form by askingthe monks to consider a beautiful young girl. He then traces the progressivestages of her physical decay, through old age, sickness, death, and the eventualdisintegration of the corpse until it is reduced to powdered bone. To show thedanger in “feeling,” the Buddha selects the feelings of a meditating monk in thejhānas, the meditative absorptions, the most refined mundane experiences ofpleasure and peace. He points out that even these lofty feelings areimpermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.Although the following texts do not explicitly apply the threefold scheme, itsunderlying presence is obvious. Emphasis falls on the aspect of danger. The twotexts presented in section 4 again accentuate the pitfalls in sensual pleasures,but do so differently from the text of the preceding section. In Text VI,4(1),the Buddha appears in dialogue with a pompous householder who imagines that hehas “cut off all worldly affairs.” To dispel his complacency, the Buddha uses aseries of similes that expose the deceptiveness of sensual pleasures to show himwhat the “cutting off of affairs” means in his own system of training. The useof similes prevails in Text VI,4(2) as well, which pits the Buddha against ahedonist named Māgandiya. The Buddha here contends that sensual pleasures seemto be pleasurable only through a distortion of perception, but when seen rightlyare like the fire in a burning charcoal pit—“painful to touch, hot, andscorching.” This passage includes some of the most powerful similes in theNikāyas, and there can be little doubt that the Buddha has not used themlightly.The use of imagery also figures prominently in Text VI,5, whose theme is thetransience of human life. Buddhist literature frequently advises us tocontemplate the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time of itsarrival. This recommendation is not made to induce an attitude of chronicmorbidity but to help us break our infatuation with life and develop detachment.For this reason, recollection of death has become one of the most importantsubjects of Buddhist meditation. The Buddha elsewhere says that the recollectionof death “when developed and cultivated, gains a foothold in the Deathless andculminates in the Deathless” (AN 7:46; IV 47–48). Here the transience of life isunderscored by counting up the number of days, seasons, and even meals in asingle life.Text VI,6 is an excerpt from the Raṭṭhapāla Sutta, which recounts the life ofthe disciple the Buddha called “the foremost of those who have gone forth out offaith.” Raṭṭhapāla was a young man from a well-established family who was sodeeply stirred upon hearing the Buddha preach that he at once decided to embracethe homeless life of a monk. The Buddha asked him to obtain his parents’permission, but his parents, being strongly attached to their only son,adamantly refused to give their consent. Raṭṭhapāla thereupon lay down on theground and refused to eat or drink, determined to die right there or receive thegoing forth. His parents finally relented and permitted him to become a monk onthe condition that he later return to visit them. Years later, when he visitedhis parents, they tried to entice him back to the household life, but since hehad already attained arahantship he was now beyond any possibility of disrobing.After leaving their home, he went to the royal pleasure garden, where he gave adiscourse to King Koravya on “four summaries of the Dhamma.” This discourseconveys his profound insights into the depth and universality of suffering,explaining in simple and lucid words why he, like countless other capable menand women in the prime of life, chose to leave the comforts of the household forthe uncertainties of the homeless state.Craving for sensual pleasures is one trap that keeps beings bound to the roundof rebirths. Another major trap is attachment to views. Thus, to clear the pathto Nibbāna, the Buddha not only had to dispel infatuation with sensualpleasures but also to expose the danger in views. This is the theme of section7.The most dangerous of wrong views are those that deny or undermine thefoundations of ethics. Text VI,7(1) draws together a number of perils posed bythis type of wrong view; prominent among them is rebirth in the lower realms.Views also lead to one-sided, biased interpretations of reality that we cling toas accurate and complete. People who cling tenaciously to their own views of aparticular situation often come into conflict with those who view the samesituation in a different light. Views thus give rise to conflicts and disputes.Perhaps no text in all of world literature has depicted this danger in dogmaticclinging more succinctly than the famous parable of the blind men and theelephant, included here as Text VI,7(2).Text VI,7(3) draws a contrast between the pair of distorted views known aseternalism (sassatav̄da) and annihilationism (ucchedav̄da), also called,respectively, the view of existence (bhavadiṭṭhi) and the view of nonexistence(vibhavadiṭṭhi). Eternalism affirms an eternal component in the individual, anindestructible self, and an eternal ground of the world, such as an all-powerfulcreator God. Annihilationism denies that there is any survival beyond death,holding that the individual comes to a complete end with the demise of thephysical body. Eternalism, according to the Buddha, leads to delight inexistence and binds beings to the cycle of existence. Annihilationism is oftenaccompanied by a disgust with existence that, paradoxically, binds its adherentsto the same existence that they loathe. As we will see below, the Buddha’steaching of dependent origination avoids both these futile ends (see IX, pp.356–57).Text VI,8 highlights a particular problem posed by eternalist views. Such viewscan inspire meditators to attain states of deep meditative bliss, which theyinterpret as union with a divine reality or realization of an eternal self. Fromthe perspective of the Buddha’s teaching, however, such attainments merelycreate the karmic potential for rebirth into a realm in which that meditativeexperience becomes the fundamental condition of consciousness. In other words,the attainment of these states in the human realm generates rebirth into thecorresponding planes in the realm of subtle form or the formless realm. Whilemany religions point to a divine realm as the final answer to the humanpredicament, the Buddha’s teaching holds that these worlds offer no final outletfrom the impermanence and misery of saṃsāra.The text cited here shows that certain meditators attain the four “divineabodes” and take rebirth in the corresponding planes of the brahma world, wherethey might abide even for as long as five hundred great eons. Eventually,however, they must inevitably pass away and may then fall into the unfortunaterealms of rebirth. Similar texts not included here (AN 3:114, 4:124) say thesame respectively about realms of rebirth corresponding to the jhānas and theformless attainments.The two suttas that constitute the final section of this chapter again take upthe unsatisfactoriness and insecurity of conditioned existence, reinforcingtheir message with dramatic imagery. In Text VI,9(1), the Buddha declares thatthe amount of tears we have shed while wandering through the round of rebirthsis greater than the water in the four great oceans. In Text VI,9(2), he tells agroup of thirty monks that the amount of blood they have shed when they wereslaughtered and executed in the round of rebirths is greater than the water inthe four great oceans. According to the compilers of the sutta, the impact ofthis discourse upon the thirty monks was so powerful that all attained fullliberation on the spot.VI. DEEPENING ONE’S PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD1. FOUR WONDERFUL THINGS“Monks, on the manifestation of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One, four wonderful and marvelous things appear. What four?“People for the most part delight in attachment, take delight in attachment,rejoice in attachment. But when the Dhamma of nonattachment is taught by theTathāgata, people wish to listen to it, lend an ear, and try to understand it.This is the first wonderful and marvelous thing that appears on themanifestation of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.“People for the most part delight in conceit, take delight in conceit, rejoicein conceit. But when the Dhamma is taught by the Tathāgata for the abolition ofconceit, people wish to listen to it, lend an ear, and try to understand it.This is the second wonderful and marvelous thing that appears on themanifestation of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.“People for the most part delight in restlessness, take delight in restlessness,rejoice in restlessness. But when the Dhamma of peace is taught by theTathāgata, people wish to listen to it, lend an ear, and try to understand it.This is the third wonderful and marvelous thing that appears on themanifestation of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.“People for the most part live in ignorance, are blinded by ignorance, fetteredby ignorance. But when the Dhamma is taught by the Tathāgata for the abolitionof ignorance, people wish to listen to it, lend an ear, and try to understandit. This is the fourth wonderful and marvelous thing that appears on themanifestation of a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.“On the manifestation of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly EnlightenedOne, these four wonderful and marvelous things appear.”(AN 4:128; II 131–32)2. GRATIFICATION, DANGER, AND ESCAPE(1) BEFORE MY ENLIGHTENMENT“Before my enlightenment, O monks, while I was still a bodhisatta, it occurredto me: ‘What is the gratification in the world, what is the danger in the world,what is the escape from the world?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘Whatever pleasureand joy there is in the world, this is the gratification in the world; that theworld is impermanent, bound up with suffering, and subject to change, this isthe danger in the world; the removal and abandoning of desire and lust for theworld, this is the escape from the world.’“So long, monks, as I did not directly know, as they really are, thegratification in the world as gratification, its danger as danger, and theescape from the world as escape, for so long I did not claim to have awakened tothe unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, andBrahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas andhumans.“But when I directly knew all this, then I claimed to have awakened to theunsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with … its devas and humans. Theknowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakable is the liberation of my mind; thisis my last birth; there is now no renewed existence.’”(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)(2) I SET OUT SEEKING“O monks, I set out seeking the gratification in the world. Whatevergratification there is in the world, that I have found. I have clearly seen withwisdom just how far the gratification in the world extends.“I set out seeking the danger in the world. Whatever danger there is in theworld, that I have found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far thedanger in the world extends.“I set out seeking an escape from the world. Whatever escape there is from theworld, that I have found. I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far theescape from the world extends.”(AN 3:101 §3; I 259)(3) IF THERE WERE NO GRATIFICATION“If, monks, there were no gratification in the world, beings would not becomeenamored with the world. But because there is gratification in the world, beingsbecome enamored with it.“If there were no danger in the world, beings would not become disenchanted withthe world. But because there is danger in the world, beings become disenchantedwith it.“If there were no escape from the world, beings could not escape from it. But asthere is an escape from the world, beings can escape from it.”(AN 3:102; I 260)3. PROPERLY APPRAISING OBJECTS OF ATTACHMENT1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Then, when it was morning, a number of monks dressed, and taking their bowlsand outer robes, went into Sāvatthī for alms. Then they thought: “It is stilltoo early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Suppose we went to the park of thewanderers of other sects.” So they went to the park of the wanderers of othersects and exchanged greetings with the wanderers. When this courteous andamiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side. The wanderers said tothem:3. “Friends, the ascetic Gotama describes the full understanding of sensualpleasures, and we do so too; the ascetic Gotama describes the full understandingof form, and we do so too; the ascetic Gotama describes the full understandingof feelings, and we do so too. What then is the distinction here, friends, whatis the variance, what is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching ofthe Dhamma and ours, between his instructions and ours?”1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en104]4. Then those monks neither approved nor disapproved of the wanderers’ words.Without doing either they rose from their seats and went away, thinking: “Weshall come to understand the meaning of these words in the Blessed One’spresence.”5. When they had wandered for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from theiralmsround, after the meal they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homageto him, they sat down at one side and told him what had taken place. [TheBlessed One said:]6. “Monks, wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be questioned thus:‘But, friends, what is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is theescape in the case of sensual pleasures? What is the gratification, what is thedanger, and what is the escape in the case of form? What is the gratification,what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of feelings?’ If they arequestioned thus, wanderers of other sects will fail to account for the matter,and what is more, they will get into difficulties. Why is that? Because it isnot their province. Monks, I see no one in the world with its devas, Māra, andBrahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas andhumans, who could satisfy the mind with a reply to these questions except forthe Tathāgata or his disciple or one who has learned it from them.[SENSUAL PLEASURES]7. (i) “And what, monks, is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures?Monks, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the five? Formscognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable,connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by theear.… Odors cognizable by the nose.… Flavors cognizable by the tongue.… Tactileobjects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable andlikeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. These are thefive cords of sensual pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent onthese five cords of sensual pleasure are the gratification in the case ofsensual pleasures.8. (ii) “And what, monks, is the danger in the case of sensual pleasures? Here,monks, on account of the craft by which a clansman makes a living—whetherchecking, accounting, calculating, farming, trading, husbandry, archery, theroyal service, or whatever craft it may be—he has to face cold and heat; he isinjured by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things; herisks death by hunger and thirst. Now this is a danger in the case of sensualpleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life, having sensualpleasures as its cause, source, and basis, the cause being simply sensualpleasures.9. “If no property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes aneffort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast andbecomes distraught, crying: ‘My work is in vain, my effort is fruitless!’ Nowthis too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of sufferingvisible in this present life, having sensual pleasures as its cause, source, andbasis, the cause being simply sensual pleasures.10. “If property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes aneffort thus, he experiences pain and grief in protecting it: ‘How shall neitherkings nor thieves make off with my property, nor fire burn it, nor water sweepit away, nor unloved heirs make off with it?’ And as he guards and protects hisproperty, kings or thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweepsit away, or unloved heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, andlaments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘I nolonger have my property!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensualpleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life, having sensualpleasures as its cause, source, and basis, the cause being simply sensualpleasures.11. “Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... kings quarrel with kings,khattiyas with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, householders withhouseholders; mother quarrels with son, son with mother, father with son, sonwith father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister withbrother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls, and disputesthey attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, whereby they incurdeath or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensualpleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life, having sensualpleasures as its cause, source, and basis, the cause being simply sensualpleasures.12. “Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take swords and shieldsand buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge into battle massed in doublearray with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing; and there they arewounded by arrows and spears, and their heads are cut off by swords, wherebythey incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case ofsensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life, havingsensual pleasures as its cause, source, and basis, the cause being simplysensual pleasures.13. “Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take swords and shieldsand buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge slippery bastions, with arrowsand spears flying and swords flashing; and there they are wounded by arrows andspears and splashed with boiling liquids and crushed under heavy weights, andtheir heads are cut off by swords, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering.Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of sufferingvisible in this present life, having sensual pleasures as its cause, source, andbasis, the cause being simply sensual pleasures.14. “Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men break into houses,plunder wealth, commit burglary, ambush highways, seduce others’ wives, and whenthey are caught, kings have many kinds of torture inflicted on them ... wherebythey incur death or deadly suffering.

Having done so, on the breakup of the body, afterdeath, they are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lowerworld, in hell.

(iii) “And what, monks, is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures? Itis the removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust forsensual pleasures. This is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures.17. “That those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as it really is thegratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escapein the case of sensual pleasures, can either themselves fully understand sensualpleasures or instruct others so that they can fully understand sensualpleasures—that is impossible.

(i) “And what, monks, is the gratification in the case of form? Supposethere were a girl of the khattiya class or the brahmin class or of householderstock, in her fifteenth or sixteenth year, neither too tall nor too short,neither too thin nor too fat, neither too dark nor too fair. Is her beauty andloveliness then at its height?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Now the pleasure and joythat arise in dependence on that beauty and loveliness are the gratification inthe case of form.19. (ii) “And what, monks, is the danger in the case of form? Later on one mightsee that same woman here at eighty, ninety, or a hundred years, aged, as crookedas a roof bracket, doubled up, supported by a walking stick, tottering, frail,her youth gone, her teeth broken, gray-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled,with limbs all blotchy. What do you think, monks? Has her former beauty andloveliness vanished and the danger become evident?”—“Yes, venerablesir.”—“Monks, this is a danger in the case of form.20. “Again, one might see that same woman afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill,lying fouled in her own urine and excrement, lifted up by some and set down byothers. What do you think, monks? Has her former beauty and loveliness vanishedand the danger become evident?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Monks, this too is adanger in the case of form.21. “Again, one might see that same woman as a corpse thrown aside in a charnelground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter. What doyou think, monks? Has her former beauty and loveliness vanished and the dangerbecome evident?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Monks, this too is a danger in the caseof form.22–29. “Again, one might see that same woman as a corpse thrown aside in acharnel ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, orvarious kinds of worms ... a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together withsinews ...a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews...a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews ...disconnectedbones scattered in all directions—here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here athigh-bone, there a rib-bone, here a hip-bone, there a back-bone, here the skull… bones bleached white, the color of shells ... bones heaped up … bones morethan a year old, rotted and crumbled to dust.

This is theescape in the case of form.31. “That those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as it really is thegratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escapein the case of form, can either themselves fully understand form or instructothers so that they can fully understand form—that is impossible.

(i) “And what, monks, is the gratification in the case of feelings? Here,monks, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states,a monk enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied bythought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. On suchan occasion he does not choose for his own affliction, or for another’saffliction, or for the affliction of both. On that occasion he feels onlyfeeling that is free from affliction. The highest gratification in the case offeelings is freedom from affliction, I say.33–35. “Again, with the stilling of thought and examination, a monk enters uponand dwells in the second jhāna.… With the fading away as well of rapture ... heenters upon and dwells in the third jhāna.... With the abandoning of pleasureand pain he enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna.… On such an occasion hedoes not choose for his own affliction, or for another’s affliction, or for theaffliction of both. On that occasion he feels only feeling that is free fromaffliction. The highest gratification in the case of feelings is freedom fromaffliction, I say.36. (ii) “And what, monks, is the danger in the case of feelings? Feelings areimpermanent, suffering, and subject to change. This is the danger in the case offeelings.37. (iii) “And what, monks, is the escape in the case of feelings? It is theremoval of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust for feelings.This is the escape in the case of feelings.38. “That those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as it really is thegratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escapein the case of feelings, can either themselves fully understand feelings orinstruct others so that they can fully understand feelings—that is impossible.That those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is thegratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escapein the case of feelings, can themselves fully understand feelings and instructothers so that they can fully understand feelings—that is possible.”That is what the Blessed One said. The monks were satisfied and delighted in theBlessed One’s words.(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)4. THE PITFALLS IN SENSUAL PLEASURES(1) CUTTING OFF ALL AFFAIRS[The householder Potaliya asked the Blessed One:] “Venerable sir, how is thecutting off of affairs3 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en106] inthe Noble One’s discipline achieved entirely and in all ways? It would be good,venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma, showing me how thecutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s discipline is achieved entirely and inall ways.”“Then listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One saidthis:15. “Householder, suppose a dog, overcome by hunger and weakness, was waiting bya butcher’s shop. Then a skilled butcher or his apprentice would toss the dog awell-hacked, clean-hacked skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood. What doyou think, householder? Would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness bygnawing such a well-hacked, clean-hacked skeleton of meatless bones smeared withblood?”“No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because that was a skeleton of well-hacked,clean-hacked meatless bones smeared with blood. Eventually that dog would reapweariness and disappointment.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to a skeleton by the Blessed One; they provide much suffering andmuch despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thus asit really is with proper wisdom, he avoids the equanimity that is diversified,based on diversity, and develops the equanimity that is unified, based onunity,4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en107] where clinging tothe carnal things of the world utterly ceases without remainder.16. “Householder, suppose a vulture, a heron, or a hawk seized a piece of meatand flew away, and then other vultures, herons, and hawks pursued it and peckedand clawed it. What do you think, householder? If that first vulture, heron, orhawk does not quickly let go of that piece of meat, wouldn’t it thereby incurdeath or deadly suffering?”“Yes, venerable sir.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to a piece of meat by the Blessed One; they provide much sufferingand much despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thusas it really is with proper wisdom … clinging to the carnal things of the worldutterly ceases without remainder.17. “Householder, suppose a man took a blazing grass torch and went against thewind. What do you think, householder? If that man does not quickly let go ofthat blazing grass torch, wouldn’t that blazing grass torch burn his hand or hisarm or some other part of his body, so that he might incur death or deadlysuffering because of that?”“Yes, venerable sir.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to a grass torch by the Blessed One; they provide much sufferingand much despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thusas it really is with proper wisdom … clinging to the carnal things of the worldutterly ceases without remainder.18. “Householder, suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s heightfull of glowing coals without flame or smoke. Then a man came who wanted to liveand not to die, who wanted pleasure and recoiled from pain, and two strong menseized him by both arms and dragged him toward that charcoal pit. What do youthink, householder? Would that man twist his body this way and that?” “Yes,venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man knows that if he falls into thatcharcoal pit, he will incur death or deadly suffering because of that.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to a charcoal pit by the Blessed One; they provide much sufferingand much despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thusas it really is with proper wisdom … clinging to the carnal things of the worldutterly ceases without remainder.19. “Householder, suppose a man dreamed about lovely parks, lovely groves,lovely meadows, and lovely lakes, and on waking he saw nothing of them. So too,householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures have beencompared to a dream by the Blessed One; they provide much suffering and muchdespair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thus as itreally is with proper wisdom ... clinging to the carnal things of the worldutterly ceases without remainder.20. “Householder, suppose a man borrowed goods on loan—a fancy carriage and finejewel earrings—and preceded and surrounded by those borrowed goods he went tothe marketplace. Then people, seeing him, would say: ‘Sirs, that is a rich man!That is how the rich enjoy their wealth!’ Then the owners, whenever they sawhim, would take back their things. What do you think, householder? Would that beenough for that man to become dejected?”“Yes, venerable sir. Why is that? Because the owners took back their things.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to borrowed goods by the Blessed One; they provide much sufferingand much despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seen this thusas it really is with proper wisdom ... clinging to carnal things of the worldutterly ceases without remainder.21. “Householder, suppose a dense grove not far from some village or town had afruit-laden tree, none of whose fruit had fallen to the ground. Then a man cameneeding fruit, seeking fruit, wandering in search of fruit, and he entered thegrove and saw the tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought: ‘This tree isladen with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground. I know how toclimb a tree, so let me climb this tree, eat as much fruit as I want, and fillmy bag.’ And he did so. Then a second man came needing fruit, seeking fruit,wandering in search of fruit, and taking a sharp axe, he too entered the groveand saw that tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought: ‘This tree is ladenwith fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground. I do not know how toclimb a tree, so let me cut this tree down at its root, eat as much fruit as Iwant, and fill my bag.’ And he did so. What do you think, householder? If thatfirst man who had climbed the tree doesn’t come down quickly, when the treefalls, wouldn’t he break his hand or foot or some other part of his body, sothat he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that?”“Yes, venerable sir.”“So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures havebeen compared to fruits on a tree by the Blessed One; they provide muchsuffering and much despair, while the danger in them is still more.’ Having seenthis thus as it really is with proper wisdom, he avoids the equanimity that isdiversified, based on diversity, and develops the equanimity that is unified,based on unity, where clinging to the carnal things of the world utterly ceaseswithout remainder.”(from MN 54: Potaliya Sutta; I 364–66)(2) THE FEVER OF SENSUAL PLEASURES10. “Māgandiya, formerly when I lived the household life, I enjoyed myself,provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure: with formscognizable by the eye ... with sounds cognizable by the ear ... with odorscognizable by the nose ... with flavors cognizable by the tongue ... withtactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable,and likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust.5[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en108] I had three palaces, onefor the rainy season, one for the winter, and one for the summer. I lived in therains’ palace for the four months of the rainy season, enjoying myself withmusicians, none male, and I did not go down to the lower palace.6[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en109]“On a later occasion, having understood as they really are the origin, thepassing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case ofsensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures, I removed thefever of sensual pleasures, and I dwell without thirst, with a mind inwardly atpeace. I see other people who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures beingdevoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with the fever of sensualpleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not envy them, nor do Idelight therein. Why is that? Because there is, Māgandiya, a delight apart fromsensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divinebliss.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en110] Since I takedelight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do I delight therein.11. “Suppose, Māgandiya, a householder or a householder’s son was rich,affluent, and wealthy, and being provided and endowed with the five cords ofsensual pleasure, he might enjoy himself with forms cognizable by the eye ...with sounds cognizable by the ear ... with odors cognizable by the nose ... withflavors cognizable by the tongue ... with tactile objects cognizable by the bodythat are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensualdesire and provocative of lust. Having conducted himself well in body, speech,and mind, on the breakup of the body, after death, he might be reborn in a gooddestination, in a heavenly world in the retinue of the Tāvatiṃsa devas; andthere, surrounded by a group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove,8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en111] he would enjoy himselfprovided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure. Suppose hesaw a householder or a householder’s son enjoying himself, provided and endowedwith the five cords of [human] sensual pleasure. What do you think, Māgandiya?Would that young deva surrounded by the group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove,enjoying himself provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensualpleasure, envy the householder or the householder’s son for the five cords ofhuman sensual pleasure or would he be enticed by human sensual pleasures?”“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because divine sensual pleasures are more excellentand sublime than human sensual pleasures.”12. “So too, Māgandiya, formerly when I lived the household life, I enjoyedmyself, provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure: with formscognizable by the eye ... with tactile objects cognizable by the body that arewished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire andprovocative of lust. On a later occasion, having understood as they really arethe gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures,I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures, I removed the fever of sensualpleasures, and I dwell without thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace. I seeother people who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured bycraving for sensual pleasures, burning with the fever of sensual pleasures,indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not envy them nor do I delight therein.Why is that? Because there is, Māgandiya, a delight apart from sensualpleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do I delighttherein.13. “Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on hislimbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of hiswounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit. Thenhis friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physicianto treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of thatmedicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy,independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then he might seeanother leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms,scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterizinghis body over a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, Māgandiya? Would thatman envy that leper for his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine?” “No,Master Gotama. Why is that? Because when there is sickness, there is need formedicine, and when there is no sickness there is no need for medicine.”14. “So too, Māgandiya, formerly when I lived the household life ... [as in§12] … Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do Idelight therein.15. “Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on hislimbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of hiswounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit.

The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of thatmedicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy,independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong menwould seize him by both arms and drag him toward a burning charcoal pit. What doyou think, Māgandiya? Would that man twist his body this way and that?” “Yes,Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, hot,and scorching.” “What do you think, Māgandiya? Is it only now that that fire ispainful to touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful totouch, hot, and scorching?” “Master Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch,hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, andscorching. For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs,being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his woundswith his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actuallypainful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.”16. “So too, Māgandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch,hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch,hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch,hot, and scorching. But these people who are not free from lust for sensualpleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with thefever of sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, thoughsensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistakenperception of them as pleasant.9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en112]17. “Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on hislimbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of hiswounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit; themore he scratches the scabs and cauterizes his body, the fouler, moreevil-smelling, and more infected the openings of his wounds would become, yet hewould find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching theopenings of his wounds. So too, Māgandiya, people who are not free from lustfor sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, whoburn with the fever of sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual pleasures;the more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensualpleasures increases and the more they are burned by the fever of sensualpleasures, yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment independence on the five cords of sensual pleasure.”(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)5. LIFE IS SHORT AND FLEETING“Long ago, O monks, there lived a religious teacher named Araka, who was free ofsensual lust. He had many hundreds of disciples, and this was the doctrine hetaught to them:“‘Short is the life of human beings, O brahmins, limited and brief; it is fullof suffering, full of tribulation. This one should wisely understand. One shoulddo good and live a pure life; for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as a dew drop on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish atsunrise and will not last long; even so, brahmins, is human life like a dewdrop. It is short, limited, and brief; it is full of suffering, full oftribulation. This one should wisely understand. One should do good and live apure life; for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as, when rain falls from the sky in thick drops, a bubble appearing onthe water will quickly vanish and will not last long; even so, brahmins, ishuman life like a water bubble. It is short ... for none who is born can escapedeath.“‘Just as a line drawn on water with a stick will quickly vanish and will notlast long; even so, brahmins, is human life like a line drawn on water. It isshort ... for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as a mountain stream, coming from afar, swiftly flowing, carrying alongmuch flotsam, will not stand still for a moment, an instant, a second, but willrush on, swirl and flow forward; even so, brahmins, is human life like amountain stream. It is short … for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as a strong man might form a lump of spittle at the tip of his tongue andspit it out with ease; even so, brahmins, is human life like a lump of spittle.It is short ... for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as a piece of meat thrown into an iron pan heated all day will quicklyburn up and will not last long; even so, brahmins, is human life like this pieceof meat. It is short ... for none who is born can escape death.“‘Just as, when a cow to be slaughtered is led to the shambles, whenever shelifts a leg she will be closer to slaughter, closer to death; even so, brahmins,is human life like cattle doomed to slaughter; it is short, limited, and brief.It is full of suffering, full of tribulation. This one should wisely understand.One should do good and live a pure life; for none who is born can escape death.’“But at that time, O monks, the human lifespan was 60,000 years, and at 500years girls were ready for marriage. In those days people had but sixafflictions: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, excrement, and urine. Though peoplelived so long and had so few afflictions, that teacher Araka gave to hisdisciples such a teaching: ‘Short is the life of human beings.…’“But nowadays, O monks, one could rightly say, ‘Short is the life of humanbeings …’; for today one who lives long lives for a hundred years or a littlemore. And when living for a hundred years, it is just for three hundred seasons:a hundred winters, a hundred summers, and a hundred rains. When living for threehundred seasons, it is just for twelve hundred months: four hundred wintermonths, four hundred summer months, and four hundred months of the rains. Whenliving for twelve hundred months, it is just for twenty-four hundred fortnights:eight hundred fortnights of winter, eight hundred of summer, and eight hundredof the rains.“And when living for twenty-four hundred fortnights, it is just for 36,000 days:12,000 days of winter, 12,000 of summer, and 12,000 of the rains. And whenliving for 36,000 days, he eats just 72,000 meals: 24,000 meals in winter,24,000 in summer, and 24,000 in the rains. And this includes the taking ofmother’s milk and the times without food. These are the times without food: whenagitated or grieved or sick, when observing a fast, or when not obtaininganything to eat.“Thus, O monks, I have reckoned the life of a centenarian: the limit of hislifespan, the number of seasons, years, months, and fortnights, of days andnights, of his meals and foodless times.“Whatever should be done by a compassionate teacher who, out of compassion,seeks the welfare of his disciples, that I have done for you. These are theroots of trees, O monks, these are empty huts. Meditate, monks, do not benegligent, or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”(AN 7:70; IV 136–39)6. FOUR SUMMARIES OF THE DHAMMA26. The Venerable Raṭṭhapāla went to King Koravya’s Migācīra garden and satdown at the root of a tree to pass the day.27. Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus: “Good gamekeeper, tidy upthe Migācīra Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasingspot.”—“Yes, sire,” he replied. Now while he was tidying up the MigācīraGarden, the gamekeeper saw the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla seated at the root of atree for the day’s abiding. When he saw him, he went to King Koravya and toldhim: “Sire, the Migācīra Garden has been tidied up. The clansman Raṭṭhapālais there, the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakoṭṭhita, of whom youhave always spoken highly; he is seated at the root of a tree for the day’sabiding.”“Then, good gamekeeper, enough of the pleasure garden for today. Now we shall goto pay respects to that Master Raṭṭhapāla.”28. Then, saying: “Give away all the food that has been prepared there,” KingKoravya had a number of state carriages prepared, and mounting one of them,accompanied by the other carriages, he drove out from Thullakoṭṭhita with thefull pomp of royalty to see the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla. He drove thus as far asthe road was passable for carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriageand went forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to wherethe Venerable Raṭṭhapāla was. He exchanged greetings with the VenerableRaṭṭhapāla, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stoodat one side and said: “Here is an elephant rug. Let Master Raṭṭhapāla beseated on it.”“There is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat.”King Koravya sat down on a seat made ready and said:29. “Master Raṭṭhapāla, there are four kinds of loss. Because they haveundergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off their hair andbeard, put on the ochre robe, and go forth from the household life intohomelessness. What are the four? They are loss through aging, loss throughsickness, loss of wealth, and loss of relatives.30. “And what is loss through aging? Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, someone is old,aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage. Heconsiders thus: ‘I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come tothe last stage. It is no longer easy for me to acquire new wealth or to augmentwealth already acquired. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochrerobe, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.’ Because he hasundergone that loss through aging, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on theochre robe, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. This iscalled loss through aging. But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now still young, ablack-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life.Master Raṭṭhapāla has not undergone any loss through aging. What has heknown, seen, or heard that he has gone forth from the household life intohomelessness?31. “And what is loss through sickness? Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, someone isafflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. He considers thus: ‘I am afflicted,suffering, and gravely ill. It is no longer easy for me to acquire new wealth... into homelessness.’ Because he has undergone that loss through sickness … hegoes forth from the household life into homelessness. This is called lossthrough sickness. But Master Raṭṭhapāla now is free from illness andaffliction; he possesses a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warmbut medium. Master Raṭṭhapāla has not undergone any loss through sickness.What has he known, seen, or heard that he has gone forth from the household lifeinto homelessness?32. “And what is loss of wealth? Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, someone is rich,affluent, and wealthy. Gradually his wealth dwindles away. He considers thus:‘Formerly I was rich, affluent, and wealthy. Gradually my wealth has dwindledaway. It is no longer easy for me to acquire new wealth ... into homelessness.’Because he has undergone that loss of wealth ... he goes forth from thehousehold life into homelessness. This is called loss of wealth. But MasterRaṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakoṭṭhita.Master Raṭṭhapāla has not undergone any loss of wealth. What has he known,seen, or heard that he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness?33. “And what is loss of relatives? Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, someone has manyfriends and companions, kinsmen and relatives. Gradually those relatives of hisdwindle away. He considers thus: ‘Formerly I had many friends and companions,kinsmen and relatives. Gradually those relatives of mine have dwindled away. Itis no longer easy for me to acquire new wealth ... into homelessness.’ Becausehe has undergone that loss of relatives … he goes forth from the household lifeinto homelessness. This is called loss of relatives. But Master Raṭṭhapālahas many friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives, in this sameThullakoṭṭhita. Master Raṭṭhapāla has not undergone any loss of relatives.What has he known, seen, or heard that he has gone forth from the household lifeinto homelessness?34. “Master Raṭṭhapāla, these are the four kinds of loss. Because they haveundergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off their hair andbeard, put on the ochre robe, and go forth from the household life intohomelessness. Master Raṭṭhapāla has not undergone any of these. What has heknown, seen, or heard that he has gone forth from the household life intohomelessness?”35. “Great king, there are four summaries of the Dhamma that have been taught bythe Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went forth from the household life intohomelessness. What are the four?36. (1) “‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is swept away’: this is the firstsummary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant,the Perfectly Enlightened One. Knowing and seeing and hearing this, I went forthfrom the household life into homelessness.(2) “‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no protector’: this is the secondsummary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees.…(3) “‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one has to leave all and passon’: this is the third summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knowsand sees.…(4) “‘[Life in] any world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving’: thisis the fourth summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who knows andsees.…37. “Great king, these are the four summaries of the Dhamma that have beentaught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One. Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went forth from thehousehold life into homelessness.”38. “Master Raṭṭhapāla said: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is sweptaway.’ How should the meaning of that statement be understood?”“What do you think, great king? When you were twenty or twenty-five years old,were you an expert rider of elephants, an expert horse-man, an expertcharioteer, an expert archer, an expert swordsman, strong in thighs and arms,sturdy, capable in battle?”“I certainly was, Master Raṭṭhapāla. Sometimes I wonder if I had supernormalpower then. I do not see anyone who could equal me in strength.”“What do you think, great king? Are you now as strong in thighs and arms, assturdy and as capable in battle?”“No, Master Raṭṭhapāla. Now I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced inlife, come to the last stage; my years have turned eighty. Sometimes I mean toput my foot here and I put my foot somewhere else.”“Great king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees,the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, said: ‘[Life in] any world isunstable, it is swept away’; and when I knew, saw, and heard this, I went forthfrom the household life into homelessness.”“It is wonderful, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvelous how well that has beenexpressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is swept away.’ It isindeed so!39. “Master Raṭṭhapāla, there exist in this court elephant troops and cavalryand chariot troops and infantry, which will serve to subdue any threats to us.Now Master Raṭṭhapāla said: ‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and noprotector.’ How should the meaning of that statement be understood?”“What do you think, great king? Do you have any chronic ailment?”“I have a chronic wind ailment, Master Raṭṭhapāla. Sometimes my friends andcompanions, kinsmen and relatives, stand around me, thinking: ‘Now King Koravyais about to die, now King Koravya is about to die!’”“What do you think, great king? Can you command your friends and companions,your kinsmen and relatives: ‘Come, my good friends and companions, my kinsmenand relatives. All of you present share this painful feeling so that I may feelless pain’? Or do you have to feel that pain yourself alone?”“I cannot command my friends and companions, my kinsmen and relatives thus,Master Raṭṭhapāla. I have to feel that pain alone.”“Great king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees,the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, said: ‘[Life in] any world has noshelter and no protector’; and when I knew, saw, and heard this, I went forthfrom the household life into homelessness.”“It is wonderful, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvelous how well that has beenexpressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One: ‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no protector.’ It isindeed so!40. “Master Raṭṭhapāla, there exist in this court abundant gold coins andbullion stored away in vaults and lofts. Now Master Raṭṭhapāla said: ‘[Lifein] any world has nothing of its own; one has to leave all and pass on.’ Howshould the meaning of that statement be understood?”“What do you think, great king? You now enjoy yourself provided and endowed withthe five cords of sensual pleasure, but can you be certain that in the life tocome you will likewise enjoy yourself provided and endowed with these same fivecords of sensual pleasure? Or will others take over this property, while youwill have to pass on according to your actions?”“I cannot be certain of what will happen in the life to come, MasterRaṭṭhapāla. On the contrary, others will take over this property while Ishall have to pass on according to my actions.”“Great king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees,the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, said: ‘[Life in] any world hasnothing of its own; one has to leave all and pass on’; and when I knew, saw, andheard this, I went forth from the household life into homelessness.”“It is wonderful, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvelous how well that has beenexpressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One: ‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one has to leaveall and pass on.’ It is indeed so!41. “Now Master Raṭṭhapāla said: ‘[Life in] any world is incomplete,insatiate, the slave of craving.’ How should the meaning of that statement beunderstood?”“What do you think, great king? Do you reign over the rich Kuru country?”“Yes, Master Raṭṭhapāla, I do.”“What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came toyou from the east and said: ‘Please know, great king, that I have come from theeast, and there I saw a large country, powerful and rich, very populous andcrowded with people. There are plenty of elephant troops there, plenty ofcavalry, chariot troops, and infantry; there is plenty of ivory there, andplenty of gold coins and bullion both unworked and worked, and plenty of womenfor wives. With your present forces you can conquer it. Conquer it then, greatking.’ What would you do?”“We would conquer it and reign over it, Master Raṭṭhapāla.”“What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came toyou from the west ... from the north ... from the south ... from across the seaand said: ‘Please know, great king, that I have come from across the sea, andthere I saw a large country, powerful and rich.… Conquer it then, great king.’What would you do?”“We would conquer it too and reign over it, Master Raṭṭhapāla.”“Great king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees,the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, said: ‘[Life in] any world isincomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving’; and when I knew, saw, and heardthis, I went forth from the household life into homelessness.”“It is wonderful, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvelous how well that has beenexpressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One: ‘[Life in] any world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave ofcraving.’ It is indeed so!”(from MN 82: Raṭṭhapāla Sutta; II 65–82)7. THE DANGER IN VIEWS(1) A MISCELLANY ON WRONG VIEW“Monks, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisenunwholesome qualities of mind arise and arisen unwholesome qualities of mindincrease and expand so much as on account of wrong view.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en113] For one of wrong view,unarisen unwholesome qualities of mind arise and arisen unwholesome qualities ofmind increase and expand.“Monks, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen wholesomequalities of mind do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities of mind diminishso much as on account of wrong view. For one of wrong view, unarisen wholesomequalities of mind do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities of mind diminish.“Monks, I do not see even one other thing on account of which, with the breakupof the body, after death, beings are reborn in a state of misery, in a baddestination, in the lower world, in hell, so much as on account of wrong view.Possessing wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, beings arereborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.“Monks, for a person of wrong view, whatever bodily, verbal, or mental conducthe undertakes in accordance with that view, and whatever volition, aspiration,wish, and volitional formations he engenders in accordance with that view, alllead to what is undesirable, unwanted, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering.For what reason? Because the view is bad. Just as, when a seed of neem, bittercucumber, or bitter gourd is planted in moist soil, it transforms any nutrimentit obtains from the soil and the water into a fruit with a bitter, harsh, anddisagreeable taste, even so is it for a person of wrong view. For what reason?Because the view is bad.”(AN 1: xvii, 1, 3, 7, 9; I 30–32)(2) THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANTOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove,Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now at that time a number of ascetics and brahmins,wanderers of other sects, were living around Sāvatthī. They held variousviews, beliefs, and opinions, and propagated various views. And they werequarrelsome, disputatious, wrangling, wounding each other with verbal darts,saying, “The Dhamma is like this, the Dhamma is not like that! The Dhamma is notlike this, the Dhamma is like that!”Then a number of monks entered Sāvatthī on almsround. Having returned, aftertheir meal they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to oneside, and told him what they had seen. [The Blessed One said:]“Monks, wanderers of other sects are blind and sightless. They do not know whatis beneficial and harmful. They do not know what is the Dhamma and what is notthe Dhamma, and thus they are so quarrelsome and disputatious.“Formerly, monks, there was a king in Sāvatthī who addressed a man and askedhim to round up all the persons in the city who were blind from birth. When theman had done so, the king asked the man to show the blind men an elephant. Tosome of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant, to some the ear, toothers a tusk, the trunk, the body, a foot, the hindquarters, the tail, or thetuft at the end of the tail. And to each one he said, ‘This is an elephant.’“When he reported to the king what he had done, the king went to the blind menand asked them, ‘Tell me, blind men, what is an elephant like?’“Those who had been shown the head of the elephant replied, ‘An elephant, yourmajesty, is just like a water jar.’ Those who had been shown the ear replied,‘An elephant is just like a winnowing basket.’ Those who had been shown the tuskreplied, ‘An elephant is just like a plowshare.’ Those who had been shown thetrunk replied, ‘An elephant is just like a plow pole.’ Those who had been shownthe body replied, ‘An elephant is just like a storeroom.’ And each of the otherslikewise described the elephant in terms of the part they had been shown.“Then, saying, ‘An elephant is like this, an elephant is not like that! Anelephant is not like this, an elephant is like that!’ they fought each otherwith their fists. And the king was delighted. Even so, monks, are the wanderersof other sects blind and sightless, and thus they become quarrelsome,disputatious, and wrangling, wounding each other with verbal darts.”(Ud 6:4; 67–69)(3) HELD BY TWO KINDS OF VIEWS“Monks, held by two kinds of views, some devas and human beings hold back andsome overreach; only those with vision see.“And how, monks, do some hold back? Devas and human beings delight in existence,are delighted with existence, rejoice in existence. When the Dhamma is taught tothem for the cessation of existence, their minds do not enter into it, acquireconfidence in it, settle upon it, or resolve upon it. Thus, monks, do some holdback.“And how, monks, do some overreach? Now some are troubled, ashamed, anddisgusted by this very same existence and they rejoice in nonexistence, saying,‘In as much as this self, good sirs, is annihilated and destroyed with thebreakup of the body and does not exist after death, this is peaceful, this isexcellent, this is just so!’ Thus, monks, do some overreach.“And how, monks do those with vision see? Here, a monk sees what has come to beas having come to be. Having seen it thus, he practices the course fordisenchantment, for dispassion, for the cessation of what has come to be. Thus,monks, do those with vision see.”(It 49; 43–44)8. FROM THE DIVINE REALMS TO THE INFERNAL“Monks, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. Whatfour?“Here, monks, some person dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued withloving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third, and the fourth. Thusabove, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwellspervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast,exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill will. He relishes it, takesa liking to it, and is thrilled by it. If he is firm in it, resolves upon it,often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn incompanionship with the devas of Brahmā’s company. The lifespan of those devasis an eon. The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completedthe entire lifespan of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, and tothe domain of spirits. But the Blessed One’s disciple remains there all hislife, and when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he attainsfinal Nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the difference, thedisparity, the distinction between the instructed noble disciple and theuninstructed worldling, that is, with regard to destination and rebirth.“Here, monks, some person dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued withcompassion, likewise the second quarter, the third, and the fourth. Thus above,below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading theentire world with a mind imbued with compassion, vast, exalted, measureless,without hostility, without ill will.

If he is firm in it, resolves upon it,often dwells in it, and has not lost it when he dies, he is reborn incompanionship with the devas of refulgent glory. The lifespan of those devas isfour eons.

THE PERILS OF SAMSĀRA(1) THE STREAM OF TEARS“Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is notdiscerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fetteredby craving. What do you think, monks, which is more: the stream of tears thatyou have shed as you roamed and wandered through this long course, weeping andwailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from theagreeable—this or the water in the four great oceans?” “As we understand theDhamma taught by the Blessed One, venerable sir, the stream of tears that wehave shed as we roamed and wandered through this long course, weeping andwailing because of being united with the disagreeable and separated from theagreeable—this alone is more than the water in the four great oceans.” “Good,good, monks! It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in such away. The stream of tears that you have shed as you roamed and wandered throughthis long course, weeping and wailing because of being united with thedisagreeable and separated from the agreeable—this alone is more than the waterin the four great oceans. For a long time, monks, you have experienced the deathof a mother; as you have experienced this, weeping and wailing because of beingunited with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable, the stream oftears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceans.“For a long time, monks, you have experienced the death of a father ... thedeath of a brother ... the death of a sister ... the death of a son ... thedeath of a daughter ... the loss of relatives ... the loss of wealth ... lossthrough illness; as you have experienced this, weeping and wailing because ofbeing united with the disagreeable and separated from the agreeable, the streamof tears that you have shed is more than the water in the four great oceans. Forwhat reason? Because, monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning….It is enough to experience revulsion toward all formations, enough to becomedispassionate toward them, enough to be liberated from them.”(SN 15:3; II 179–80)(2) THE STREAM OF BLOODWhile the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, thirtymonks from Pāvā approached him—all forest dwellers, almsfood eaters, rag-robewearers, three-robe users, yet all still with fetters.11[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en114] Having approached, theypaid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Then it occurred to theBlessed One: “These thirty monks from Pāvā are all forest dwellers, almsfoodeaters, rag-robe wearers, three-robe users, yet all are still with fetters. Letme teach them the Dhamma in such a way that while they are sitting in these veryseats their minds will be liberated from the taints by nonclinging.”12[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_006.html#en115]Then the Blessed One addressed those monks thus: “Monks!”“Venerable sir!” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is notdiscerned of beings roaming and wandering on, hindered by ignorance and fetteredby craving. What do you think, monks, which is more: the stream of blood thatyou have shed when you were beheaded as you roamed and wandered through thislong course—this or the water in the four great oceans?”“As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, venerable sir, thestream of blood that we have shed when we were beheaded as we roamed andwandered through this long course—this alone is more than the water in the fourgreat oceans.”“Good, good, monks! It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me insuch a way. The stream of blood that you have shed as you roamed and wanderedthrough this long course—this alone is more than the water in the four greatoceans. For a long time, monks, you have been cows, and when as cows you werebeheaded, the stream of blood that you shed is greater than the waters in thefour great oceans. For a long time you have been buffalo, sheep, goats, deer,chickens, and pigs…. For a long time you have been arrested as burglars,highwaymen, and adulterers, and when you were beheaded, the stream of blood thatyou shed is greater than the water in the four great oceans. For what reason?Because, monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first pointis not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on, hindered by ignorance andfettered by craving. For such a long time, monks, you have experiencedsuffering, anguish, and disaster, and swelled the cemetery. It is enough tobecome disenchanted with all formations, enough to become dispassionate towardthem, enough to be liberated from them.”This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those monks delighted in the BlessedOne’s statement. And while this exposition was being spoken, the minds of thethirty monks from Pāvā were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.(SN 15:13; II 187–89)"},{"pageContent":"VII. The Path to Liberation012 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_012_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONIn this chapter, we come to the unique distinguishing feature of the Buddha’steaching, its “supramundane” or “world-transcending” (lokuttara) path toliberation. This path builds upon the transformed understanding and deepenedperspective on the nature of the world that arise from our recognition of theperils in sensual pleasures, the inevitability of death, and the vicious natureof saṃsāra, themes that we surveyed in the previous chapter. It aims to leadthe practitioner to the state of liberation that lies beyond all realms ofconditioned existence, to the same sorrowless and stainless bliss of Nibbānathat the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenment.This chapter presents texts that offer a broad overview of the Buddha’sworld-transcending path; the following two chapters will bring together textsthat focus more finely on the training of the mind and the cultivation ofwisdom, the two major branches of the world-transcending path. I begin, however,with several suttas that are intended to clarify the purpose of this path,illuminating it from different angles. Text VII,1(1), The Shorter Discourse toMāluṅkyāputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed toprovide theoretical answers to philosophical questions. In this sutta the monkMāluṅkyāputta approaches the Buddha and demands answers to ten speculativequestions, threatening to leave the Saṅgha if this demand is not satisfied.Scholars have debated whether the Buddha refused to answer such questionsbecause they are in principle unanswerable or simply because they are irrelevantto a practical resolution of the problem of suffering. Two collections of suttasin the Saṃyutta Nikāya—SN 33:1–10 and SN 44:7–8—make it clear that theBuddha’s “silence” had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns. These suttasshow that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption thatexistence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the selfis situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms ofthese premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questionsthemselves.However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer thesequestions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with theirsolutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering. This reasonis the evident point of the discourse to Māluṅkyāputta, with its well-knownsimile of the man shot by the poisoned arrow. Whether any of these views is trueor not, the Buddha says, “there is birth, there is aging, there is death, thereare sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, the destruction of whichI prescribe here and now.” Against the picture of the saṃsāric backgroundsketched at the end of the previous chapter, this statement now takes on anexpanded meaning: the “destruction of birth, aging, and death” is not merely theend of suffering in a single lifetime, but the end of the immeasurable sufferingof repeated birth, aging, and death that we have undergone in the countless eonsof saṃsāra.Text VII,1(2), The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood (MN 29),clarifies from a different angle the Buddha’s purpose in expounding hisworld-transcending Dhamma. The sutta is about a “clansman” who has gone forthfrom the household life into homelessness intent on reaching the end ofsuffering. Though earnest in purpose at the time of his ordination, once heattains some success, whether a lower achievement like gain and honor or asuperior one like concentration and insight, he becomes complacent and neglectshis original purpose in entering the Buddha’s path. The Buddha declares thatnone of these stations along the way—not moral discipline, concentration, oreven knowledge and vision—is the final goal of the spiritual life. The goal, itsheartwood or essential purpose, is “unshakable liberation of the mind,” and heurges those who have entered the path not to be satisfied with anything less.Text VII,1(3) is a selection of suttas from “The Connected Discourses on thePath” (Maggasạyutta). These suttas state that the purpose of practicing thespiritual life under the Buddha is “the fading away of lust, … final Nibbānawithout clinging,” the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each ofthese aims.The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation,as is already clear from the Buddha’s first sermon, in which he calls theEightfold Path the way to the cessation of suffering. Text VII,2 gives formaldefinitions of the individual path factors but does not show concretely howtheir practice is to be integrated into the life of a disciple. The detailedapplication will be filled out later in this chapter and in chapters VIII andIX.Text VII,3 throws a different spotlight on the path than we are accustomed tohear in standard Buddhist rhetoric. While we are often told that the practice ofthe Buddhist path depends entirely on personal effort, this sutta emphasizes theimportance of spiritual friendship. The Buddha declares that spiritualfriendship is not merely “half the spiritual life” but the whole of it, for theendeavor to attain spiritual perfection is not a purely solitary enterprise butoccurs in dependence on close personal ties. Spiritual friendship gives thepractice of the Dhamma an inescapably human dimension and welds the body ofBuddhist practitioners into a community united both vertically by therelationship of teacher to students and horizontally by friendships among peerstreading a shared path.Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to befollowed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately describedas components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be presentsimultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eightinterwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength. However,until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the pathexhibit some degree of sequence in their development. The eight factors arecommonly distributed into three groups as follows:1. the moral discipline group (sīlakkhandha), made up of right speech, rightaction, and right livelihood;2. the concentration group (sam̄dhikkhandha), made up of right effort, rightmindfulness, and right concentration;3. the wisdom group (paññākkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.Within the Nikāyas, however, this correlation occurs only once (at MN 44; I301), where it is ascribed to the nun Dhammadinnā, not to the Buddha himself.It might be said that the two wisdom factors are placed at the beginning becausea preliminary right view and right intention are required at the outset of thepath, right view providing the conceptual understanding of Buddhist principlesthat guides the development of the other path factors, right intention theproper motivation and direction for the development of the path.In the Nikāyas, the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradualtraining (anupubbasikkhā) that unfolds in stages from the first step to thefinal goal. This gradual training is a finer subdivision of the threefolddivision of the path into moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.Invariably in the suttas the exposition of the gradual training begins with thegoing forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, aBuddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of themonastic life in the Buddha’s pragmatic vision. In principle the entire practiceof the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic orlay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplishedin the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four stages of awakening,up to nonreturning (an̄ḡm̄; Theravāda commentators say that lay followers canalso attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but they do so either on the verge ofdeath or after attainment immediately seek the going forth). The fact remains,however, that the household life inevitably fosters a multitude of mundaneconcerns and personal attachments that impede the single-hearted quest forliberation. Thus when the Buddha set out on his own noble quest he did so bygoing into homelessness, and after his enlightenment, as a practical way to helpothers, he established the Saṅgha, the order of monks and nuns, for those whowant to devote themselves fully to the Dhamma unhindered by the cares ofhousehold life.The gradual training occurs in two versions: a longer version in the DīghaNikāya and a middle-length version in the Majjhima Nikāya. The principaldifferences are: (1) the longer version has a more detailed treatment of theobservances that pertain to monastic etiquette and ascetic self-restraint; (2)the longer version includes eight types of higher knowledge while themiddle-length version has three types. However, as these three types are theones mentioned in the Buddha’s account of his own enlightenment (see TextII,3(2)), they are by far the most important. The main paradigm for the longerversion of the gradual training is found at DN 2; the middle-length version isat MN 27 and MN 51, with variants at MN 38, MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, and MN 125.Here, Text VII,4 includes the whole of MN 27, which embeds the training in thesimile of the elephant’s footprint that gives the sutta its name. Text VII,5, anexcerpt from MN 39, repeats the higher stages of the training as described in MN27, but includes the impressive similes not included in the latter version.The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world and hisexposition of the Dhamma. Having heard this, the disciple acquires faith andfollows the Teacher into homelessness. He then undertakes the rules ofdiscipline that promote the purification of conduct and the right livelihood ofan ascetic. The next three steps—contentment, restraint of the sense faculties,and mindfulness and clear comprehension—internalize the process of purificationand thereby bridge the transition from moral discipline to concentration.The section on the abandonment of the five hindrances deals with the preliminarytraining in concentration. The five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will,dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—are the principalobstacles to meditative development, and thus they must be removed for the mindto become collected and unified. The stock passage on the gradual trainingtreats the overcoming of the hindrances only schematically, but other texts inthe Nikāyas provide more practical instructions, while the Pāli commentariesoffer even more details. The similes in the version of MN 39—see TextVII,5—illustrate the joyful sense of freedom that one wins by overcoming thehindrances.The next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhānas, profoundstates of concentration in which the mind becomes fully absorbed in its object.The Buddha enumerates four jhānas, named simply after their numerical positionin the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor. The jhānasare always described by the same formulas, which in several suttas are augmentedby similes of great beauty; again, see Text VII,5. Although wisdom rather thanconcentration is the critical factor in the attainment of enlightenment, theBuddha invariably includes the jhānas in the gradual training for at least tworeasons: first, because they contribute to the intrinsic perfection of the path;and second, because the deep concentration they induce serves as a basis for thearising of insight. The Buddha calls the jhānas the “footsteps of theTathāgata” (MN 27.19–22) and shows them to be precursors of the bliss ofNibbāna that lies at the end of the training.From the fourth jhāna three alternative lines of further development becomepossible. In a number of texts outside the stock passage on the gradual trainingthe Buddha mentions four meditative states that continue the mental unificationestablished by the jhānas. These states, described as “the liberations that arepeaceful and formless,” are further refinements of concentration. Distinguishedfrom the jhānas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that servesas the object in the jhānas, they are named the base of the infinity of space,the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the baseof neither-perception-nor-nonperception.A second line of development is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge. TheBuddha frequently refers to a set of six types, which come to be called the sixkinds of direct knowledge (chaḷabhiññā). The last of these, the knowledge ofthe destruction of the taints, is “supramundane” or world-transcending and thusmarks the culmination of the third line of development. But the other five areall mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful mental concentrationachieved in the fourth jhāna: the supernormal powers, the divine ear, theability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and theknowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings (see Text VIII,4).The jhānas and the formless attainments by themselves do not issue inenlightenment and liberation. Though lofty and peaceful, they can only silencethe defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them. Touproot the defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby arrive atenlightenment and liberation, the meditative process must be directed to a thirdline of development. This is the contemplation of “things as they really are,”which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence andculminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship.This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the passage on thegradual training. He prefaces it with descriptions of two of the directknowledges, the recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing awayand rebirth of beings. The three together figured prominently in the Buddha’sown enlightenment—as we saw in Text II,3(2)—and are collectively called thethree true knowledges (tevijjā). Although the first two are not essential tothe realization of arahantship, the Buddha probably includes them here becausethey reveal the truly vast and profound dimensions of suffering in saṃsāra,thereby preparing the mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths by whichthat suffering is diagnosed and surmounted.The passage on the gradual training does not explicitly show the process ofcontemplation by which the meditator develops insight. The whole process is onlyimplied by the mention of its final fruit, called the knowledge of thedestruction of the taints (āsavakkhayañāṇa). The āsavas or taints are aclassification of defilements considered in their role of sustaining the forwardmovement of the process of birth and death. The commentaries derive the wordfrom a root su meaning “to flow.” Scholars differ as to whether the flow impliedby the prefix ā is inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as “influxes”or “influences,” others as “outflows” or “effluents.” A stock passage in thesuttas indicates the term’s real significance independently of etymology when itdescribes the āsavas as states “that defile, bring renewal of existence, givetrouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, aging, and death” (MN36.47; I 250). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, haverendered it “cankers,” “corruptions,” or “taints.” The three taints mentioned inthe Nikāyas are respectively synonyms for craving for sensual pleasures,craving for existence, and ignorance. When the disciple’s mind is liberated fromthe taints by the completion of the path of arahantship, he reviews his newlywon freedom and roars his lion’s roar: “Birth is destroyed, the spiritual lifehas been lived, what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming backto any state of being.”VII. THE PATH TO LIBERATION1. WHY DOES ONE ENTER THE PATH?(1) THE ARROW OF BIRTH, AGING, AND DEATH1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Then, while the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta was alone in meditation, thefollowing thought arose in his mind:“These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One, set asideand rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the world is noteternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world is infinite’; ‘the soul is thesame as the body’ and ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘afterdeath a Tathāgata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist’ and‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ and ‘after death aTathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en116] The Blessed One does notdeclare these to me, and I do not approve of and accept this fact, so I shall goto the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of this. If he declares to me either‘the world is eternal’ … or ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor doesnot exist,’ then I will lead the spiritual life under him; if he does notdeclare these to me, then I will abandon the training and return to the lowerlife.”3. Then, when it was evening, the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta rose frommeditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat downat one side and told him:“Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the following thoughtarose in my mind: ‘These speculative views have been left undeclared by theBlessed One.… If he does not declare these to me, then I will abandon thetraining and return to the lower life.’ If the Blessed One knows ‘the world iseternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to me ‘the world is eternal’; if theBlessed One knows ‘the world is not eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to me‘the world is not eternal.’ If the Blessed One does not know either ‘the worldis eternal’ or ‘the world is not eternal,’ then it is straightforward for onewho does not know and see to say: ‘I do not know and see.’“If the Blessed One knows ‘the world is finite,’ … ‘the world is infinite, ’ ...‘the soul is the same as the body,’ ... ‘the soul is one thing and the bodyanother,’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata exists,’ … ’after death a Tathāgata doesnot exist.’… If the Blessed One knows ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists anddoes not exist,’ let the Blessed One declare that to me; if the Blessed Oneknows ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ let theBlessed One declare that to me. If the Blessed One does not know either ‘afterdeath a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ or ‘after death a Tathāgataneither exists nor does not exist,’ then it is straightforward for one who doesnot know and see to say: ‘I do not know and see.’”4. “How then, Māluṅkyāputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, Māluṅkyāputta,lead the spiritual life under me and I will declare to you “the world iseternal” … or “after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does notexist”’?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“Did you ever tell me: ‘I will lead the spirituallife under the Blessed One, and the Blessed One will declare to me “the world iseternal” … or “after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does notexist”’?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“That being so, misguided man, who are you andwhat are you abandoning?5. “If anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the spiritual life under theBlessed One until the Blessed One declares to me “the world is eternal” … or“after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,”’ that would stillremain undeclared by the Tathāgata and meanwhile that person would die.Suppose, Māluṅkyāputta, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared withpoison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought asurgeon to treat him. The man would say: ‘I will not let the surgeon pull outthis arrow until I know whether the man who wounded me was a khattiya, abrahmin, a merchant, or a worker.’ And he would say: ‘I will not let the surgeonpull out this arrow until I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me;…until I know whether the man who wounded me was tall, short, or of middleheight;… until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark, brown, orgolden-skinned;… until I know whether the man who wounded me lives in such avillage, town, or city;… until I know whether the bow that wounded me was a longbow or a crossbow;… until I know whether the bowstring that wounded me wasfiber, reed, sinew, hemp, or bark;… until I know whether the shaft that woundedme was wild or cultivated;… until I know with what kind of feathers the shaftthat wounded me was fitted—whether those of a vulture, a heron, a hawk, apeacock, or a stork;… until I know with what kind of sinew the shaft thatwounded me was bound—whether that of an ox, a buffalo, a deer, or a monkey; …until I know what kind of arrowhead it was that wounded me—whether spiked orrazor-tipped or curved or barbed or calf-toothed or lancet-shaped.’“All this would still not be known to that man, and meanwhile he would die. Sotoo, Māluṅkyāputta, if anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the spirituallife under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me: “the world iseternal” … or “after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,”’that would still remain undeclared by the Tathāgata and meanwhile that personwould die.6. “Māluṅkyāputta, if there is the view ‘the world is eternal,’ the spirituallife cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘the world is not eternal, ’ thespiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view ‘the world is eternal’or the view ‘the world is not eternal,’ there is birth, there is aging, there isdeath, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, thedestruction of which I prescribe here and now.“If there is the view ‘the world is finite’ ... ‘the world is infinite’ ‘thesoul is the same as the body’ ... ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’ …‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist,’the spiritual life cannot be lived.… If there is the view ‘after death aTathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived;and if there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does notexist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view ‘afterdeath a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ or the view ‘after death aTathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ there is birth, there is aging,there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, thedestruction of which I prescribe here and now.7. “Therefore, Māluṅkyāputta, remember what I have left undeclared asundeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared. And what have I leftundeclared? ‘The world is eternal’—I have left undeclared. ‘The world is noteternal’—I have left undeclared. ‘The world is finite’—I have left undeclared.‘The world is infinite’—I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is the same as thebody’—I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’—Ihave left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathāgata exists’—I have left undeclared.‘After death a Tathāgata does not exist’—I have left undeclared. ‘After death aTathāgata both exists and does not exist’—I have left undeclared. ‘After deatha Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—I have left undeclared.8. “Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it does notbelong to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it does not lead todisenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, toenlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why I have left it undeclared.9. “And what have I declared? ‘This is suffering’—I have declared. ‘This is theorigin of suffering’—I have declared. ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—Ihave declared. ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—I havedeclared.10. “Why have I declared that? Because it is beneficial, it belongs to thefundamentals of the spiritual life, it leads to disenchantment, to dispassion,to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. Thatis why I have declared it.“Therefore, Māluṅkyāputta, remember what I have left undeclared asundeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared.”That is what the Blessed One said. The Venerable Māluṅkyāputta was satisfiedand delighted in the Blessed One’s words.2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en117](MN 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)(2) THE HEARTWOOD OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha onMount Vulture Peak; it was soon after Devadatta had left.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en118] There, referring toDevadatta, the Blessed One addressed the monks thus:2. “Monks, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the household lifeinto homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth, aging, and death, ofsorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, aprey to suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can beknown.’ When he has gone forth thus, he acquires gain, honor, and renown. He ispleased with that gain, honor, and renown, and his intention is fulfilled. Onaccount of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: ‘I obtain gain andrenown, but these other monks are unknown, of no account.’ He becomesintoxicated with that gain, honor, and renown, grows negligent, falls intonegligence, and being negligent, he lives in suffering.“Suppose a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search ofheartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood. Passing overits heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark, he would cut offits twigs and leaves and take them away thinking they were heartwood. Then a manwith good sight, seeing him, might say: ‘This good man did not know theheartwood, the sapwood, the inner bark, the outer bark, or the twigs and leaves.Thus, while needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search ofheartwood, he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and passingover its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark, he cut offits twigs and leaves and took them away thinking they were heartwood. Whateverit was this good man had to make with heartwood, his purpose will not beserved.’ So too is it with this monk who becomes intoxicated with that gain,honor, and renown. This monk is called one who has taken the twigs and leaves ofthe spiritual life and stopped short with that.3. “Here, monks, some clansman goes forth out of faith from the household lifeinto homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth, aging, and death, ofsorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, aprey to suffering.

The monks were satisfied and delighted in theBlessed One’s words.(MN 29: Mahāsāropama Sutta; I 192–97)(3) THE FADING AWAY OF LUST“Monks, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is thespiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you shouldanswer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust7[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en122] that the spiritual life islived under the Blessed One.’“Then, monks, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there apath, a way for the fading away of lust?’—being asked thus, you should answerthem thus: ‘There is a path, friends, a way for the fading away of lust.’“And what, monks, is that path, that way for the fading away of lust? It is thisNoble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, rightaction, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.This is the path, the way for the fading away of lust.“Being asked thus, monks, you should answer those wanderers of other sects insuch a way.“[Or else you may answer them:] ‘It is, friends, for the abandoning of thefetters … for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies … for the fullunderstanding of the course [of saṃsāra] … for the destruction of the taints …for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation … for the sakeof knowledge and vision … for the sake of final Nibbāna without clinging thatthe spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.’“Then, monks, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there apath, a way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging?’—being asked thus,you should answer them thus: ‘There is a path, friends, a way for attainingfinal Nibbāna without clinging.’“And what, monks, is that path, that way for attaining final Nibbāna withoutclinging? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … rightconcentration. This is the path, the way for attaining final Nibbāna withoutclinging.“Being asked thus, monks, you should answer those wanderers of other sects insuch a way.”(SN 45:41–48, combined; V 27–29)2. ANALYSIS OF THE EIGHTFOLD PATH“Monks, I will teach you the Noble Eightfold Path, and I will analyze it foryou. Listen and attend closely; I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“And what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path? Right view, right intention,right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,and right concentration.“And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the originof suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, knowledge of the wayleading to the cessation of suffering: this is called right view.“And what, monks, is right intention? Intention of renunciation, intention ofnon–ill will, intention of harmlessness: this is called right intention.“And what, monks, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence frommalicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle chatter:this is called right speech.“And what, monks, is right action? Abstinence from the destruction of life,abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from sexual misconduct:this is called right action.“And what, monks, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple, having abandoned awrong mode of livelihood, earns his living by a right livelihood: this is calledright livelihood.“And what, monks, is right effort? Here, monks, a monk generates desire for thenonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arousesenergy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning ofarisen evil unwholesome states…. He generates desire for the arising of unarisenwholesome states…. He generates desire for the continuation of arisen wholesomestates, for their nondecline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment bydevelopment; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives.This is called right effort.“And what, monks is right mindfulness? Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removedlonging and dejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelingsin feelings, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing anddejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent,clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regardto the world. He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearlycomprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to theworld. This is called right mindfulness.“And what, monks, is right concentration? Here, monks, secluded from sensualpleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters and dwells in thefirst jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture andhappiness born of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, heenters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence andunification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture andhappiness born of concentration. With the fading away as well of rapture, hedwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experienceshappiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which thenoble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ Withthe abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joyand dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neitherpainful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.This is called right concentration.”(SN 45:8; V 8–10)3. GOOD FRIENDSHIPThus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among theSakyans where there was a town of the Sakyans named Nāgaraka. Then theVenerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down toone side, and said:“Venerable sir, this is half of the spiritual life, that is, good friendship,good companionship, good comradeship.”8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en123]“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This is the entire spiritual life, Ānanda,that is, good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. When a monk hasa good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, it is to be expected that hewill develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.“And how, Ānanda, does a monk with a good friend, a good companion, a goodcomrade, develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, Ānanda, a monkdevelops right view, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation,maturing in release. He develops right intention … right speech … right action …right livelihood … right effort ... right mindfulness … right concentration,which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.It is in this way, Ānanda, that a monk with a good friend, a good companion, agood comrade, develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.“By the following method too, Ānanda, it may be understood how the entirespiritual life is good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship: byrelying upon me as a good friend, Ānanda, beings subject to birth are freedfrom birth; beings subject to aging are freed from aging; beings subject todeath are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair are freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, anddespair. By this method, Ānanda, it may be understood how the entire spirituallife is good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship.”(SN 45:2; V 2–3)4. THE GRADUATED TRAINING1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.2. Now on that occasion the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi was driving out of Sāvatthīin the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by white mares. He sawthe wanderer Pilotika coming in the distance and asked him: “Now where is MasterVacchāyana coming from in the middle of the day?”9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en124]“Sir, I am coming from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”“What does Master Vacchāyana think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?He is wise, is he not?”“Sir, who am I to know the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? One would surelyhave to be his equal to know the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom.”“Master Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with high praise indeed.” “Sir,who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? The ascetic Gotama is praised by thepraised as best among devas and humans.” “What reasons does Master Vacchāyanasee that he has such firm confidence in the ascetic Gotama?”3. “Sir, suppose a wise elephant hunter were to enter an elephant wood and wereto see in the elephant wood a big elephant’s footprint, long in extent and broadacross. He would come to the conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull elephant.’So too, when I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama, I came to theconclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened, the Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the good way.’ What arethe four?4. “Sir, I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever, knowledgeableabout the doctrines of others, as sharp as hairsplitting marksmen; they wanderabout, as it were, demolishing the views of others with their sharp wits. Whenthey hear: ‘The ascetic Gotama will visit such and such a village or town,’ theyformulate a question thus: ‘We will go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him thisquestion. If he is asked like this, he will answer like this, and so we willrefute his doctrine in this way; and if he is asked like that, he will answerlike that, and so we will refute his doctrine in that way.’ “They hear: ‘Theascetic Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or town.’ They go tothe ascetic Gotama, and the ascetic Gotama instructs, urges, rouses, andgladdens them with a talk on the Dhamma. After they have been instructed, urged,roused, and gladdened by the ascetic Gotama with a talk on the Dhamma, they donot so much as ask him the question, so how should they refute his doctrine? Inactual fact, they become his disciples. When I saw this first footprint of theascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened, the Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha ispracticing the good way.’5. “Again, I have seen certain learned brahmins who were clever.… In actualfact, they too become his disciples. When I saw this second footprint of theascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened.…’6. “Again, I have seen certain learned householders who were clever.… In actualfact, they too become his disciples. When I saw this third footprint of theascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened.…’7. “Again, I have seen certain learned ascetics who were clever.… They do not somuch as ask him the question, so how should they refute his doctrine? In actualfact, they ask the ascetic Gotama to allow them to go forth from the householdlife into homelessness, and he gives them the going forth. Not long after theyhave gone forth, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, byrealizing it for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter uponand dwell in that supreme goal of the spiritual life for the sake of whichclansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. They saythus: ‘We were very nearly lost, we very nearly perished, for formerly weclaimed that we were ascetics though we were not really ascetics; we claimedthat we were brahmins though we were not really brahmins; we claimed that wewere arahants though we were not really arahants. But now we are ascetics, nowwe are brahmins, now we are arahants.’ When I saw this fourth footprint of theascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened.…’“When I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama, I came to theconclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened, the Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the good way.’”8. When this was said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi got down from his all-whitechariot drawn by white mares, and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, heextended his hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One and utteredthis exclamation three times: “Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, thePerfectly Enlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One! Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the PerfectlyEnlightened One! Perhaps some time or other I might meet Master Gotama and havesome conversation with him.”9. Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetingswith him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to oneside and related his entire conversation with the wanderer Pilotika. Thereuponthe Blessed One told him: “At this point, brahmin, the simile of the elephant’sfootprint has not yet been completed in detail. As to how it is completed indetail, listen and attend carefully to what I shall say.”—“Yes, sir,” thebrahmin Jāṇussoṇi replied. The Blessed One said this:10. “Brahmin, suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant wood and wereto see in the elephant wood a big elephant’s footprint, long in extent and broadacross. A wise elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion: ‘Indeed,this is a big bull elephant.’ Why is that? In an elephant wood there are smallshe-elephants that leave a big footprint, and this might be one of theirfootprints. He follows it and sees in the elephant wood a big elephant’sfootprint, long in extent and broad across, and some scrapings high up. A wiseelephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a bigbull elephant. ’ Why is that? In an elephant wood there are tall she-elephantsthat have prominent teeth and leave a big footprint, and this might be one oftheir footprints. He follows it further and sees in the elephant wood a bigelephant’s footprint, long in extent and broad across, and some scrapings highup, and marks made by tusks. A wise elephant hunter would not yet come to theconclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull elephant.’ Why is that? In an elephantwood there are tall she-elephants that have tusks and leave a big footprint, andthis might be one of their footprints. He follows it further and sees in theelephant wood a big elephant’s footprint, long in extent and broad across, andsome scrapings high up, and marks made by tusks, and broken-off branches. And hesees that bull elephant at the root of a tree or in the open, walking about,sitting, or lying down. He comes to the conclusion: ‘This is that big bullelephant.’11. “So too, brahmin, here a Tathāgata appears in the world, an arahant,perfectly enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knowerof the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas andhumans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized with his owndirect knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this populationwith its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and humans, he makes it known toothers. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle,and good in the end, with the right meaning and expression; he reveals a holylife that is perfectly complete and purified.12. “A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hearsthat Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata.Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty;life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to leadthe spiritual life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shaveoff my hair and beard, put on the ochre robe, and go forth from the householdlife into homelessness.’ On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a largefortune, abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off hishair and beard, puts on the ochre robe, and goes forth from the household lifeinto homelessness.13. “Having thus gone forth and possessing the monk’s training and way of life,abandoning the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life;with rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious, merciful, he dwells compassionateto all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstainsfrom taking what is not given; taking only what is given, expecting only what isgiven, by not stealing he dwells in purity. Abandoning sexual relations, heobserves celibacy, living apart, refraining from the coarse practice of sexualintercourse.“Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth,adheres to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of theworld. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech; he doesnot repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people]from these, nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere inorder to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those whoare divided, a promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord,delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harshspeech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle,pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired bymany and agreeable to many. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idlechatter; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what isgood, speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks suchwords as are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial.“He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He eats only one meal a day,abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en125] He abstains from dancing,singing, music, and unsuitable shows. He abstains from wearing garlands,smartening himself with scent, and embellishing himself with unguents. Heabstains from high and large couches. He abstains from accepting gold andsilver. He abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting rawmeat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting menand women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains fromaccepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses,and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land. He abstains from going onerrands and running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstainsfrom false weights, false metals, and false measures. He abstains from acceptingbribes, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding,murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.14. “He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood tomaintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these withhim. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden,so too the monk becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfoodto maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only thesewith him. Possessing this aggregate of noble moral discipline, he experienceswithin himself the bliss of blamelessness.15. “On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs andfeatures.11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en126] Since, if heleft the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of longing and dejectionmight invade him, he practices the way of its restraint, he guards the eyefaculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound withthe ear ... On smelling an odor with the nose ... On tasting a flavor with thetongue … On feeling a tactile object with the body ... On cognizing a mentalphenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, ifhe left the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of longing anddejection might invade him, he practices the way of its restraint, he guards themind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing thisnoble restraint of the sense faculties, he experiences within himself anunsullied bliss.16. “He becomes one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward andreturning; who acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and lookingaway; who acts with clear comprehension when flexing and extending his limbs;who acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outerrobe and bowl; who acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, chewing,and tasting; who acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating;who acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, fallingasleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.17. “Possessing this aggregate of noble moral discipline, and this noblerestraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and clearcomprehension, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of atree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket,an open space, a heap of straw.18. “On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding hislegs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness before him.Abandoning longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; hepurifies his mind from longing.12[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en127] Abandoning ill will andhatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfareof all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoningdullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipientof light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullnessand drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he dwells free fromagitation with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessnessand remorse. Abandoning doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexedabout wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.19. “Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind thatweaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesomestates, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied bythought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. This,brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata, something scraped by theTathāgata, something marked by the Tathāgata, but a noble disciple does notyet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened, theDhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the goodway.’13 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en128]20. “Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwellsin the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, iswithout thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born ofconcentration. This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata … buta noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One isperfectly enlightened.…’21. “Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and,mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; heenters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He isequanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ This too, brahmin, is called afootprint of the Tathāgata … but a noble disciple does not yet come to theconclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened.…’22. “Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previouspassing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna,which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification ofmindfulness by equanimity. This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of theTathāgata … but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘TheBlessed One is perfectly enlightened.…’23. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects hismanifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births,five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fiftybirths, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, manyeons of world-contraction, many eons of world-expansion, many eons ofworld-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, withsuch an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure andpain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere;and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such wasmy nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; andpassing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus with their aspects andparticulars he recollects his manifold past lives. This too, brahmin, is calleda footprint of the Tathāgata … but a noble disciple does not yet come to theconclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened.…’24. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With thedivine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passingaway and being reborn, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate andunfortunate. He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus:‘These beings who behaved wrongly by body, speech, and mind, who reviled thenoble ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions based on wrong view, with thebreakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, in abad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who behaved wellby body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held rightview, and undertook action based on right view, with the breakup of the body,after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’ Thuswith the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beingspassing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunateand unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to theiractions. This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata … but anoble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One isperfectly enlightened.…’25. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as itreally is: ‘This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is thecessation of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’He understands as it really is: ‘These are the taints. This is the origin of thetaints. This is the cessation of the taints. This is the way leading to thecessation of the taints.’ “This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of theTathāgata, something scraped by the Tathāgata, something marked by theTathāgata, but a noble disciple still has not yet come to the conclusion: ‘TheBlessed One is perfectly enlightened, the Dhamma is well expounded by theBlessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the good way.’ Rather, he is in theprocess of coming to this conclusion.14[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en129]26. “When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint ofsensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance.When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is liberated. ’ Heunderstands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had tobe done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’“This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata, something scrapedby the Tathāgata, something marked by the Tathāgata. It is at this point thata noble disciple has come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectlyenlightened, the Dhamma is well expounded by theBlessed One, the Saṅgha is practicing the good way.’15[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_007.html#en130] And it is at this point,brahmin, that the simile of the elephant’s footprint has been completed indetail.”27. When this was said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Blessed One:“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has madethe Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had beenoverthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, orholding up a lamp in the dark so those with good eyesight can see forms. I nowgo for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks. LetMaster Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from todayuntil life’s end.”(MN 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)5. THE HIGHER STAGES OF TRAINING WITH SIMILES12. “Here, monks, a monk resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, theroot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, ajungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.13. “On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding hislegs crosswise, setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him.Abandoning longing for the world … [as in preceding text, §18] … he purifies hismind from doubt.14. “Monks, suppose a man were to take a loan and undertake business, and hisbusiness were to succeed so that he could repay all the money of the old loan,and there would remain enough extra to maintain a wife; on considering this, hewould be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were afflicted, suffering andgravely ill, and his food would not agree with him and his body had no strength,but later he would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with himand his body would regain strength; on considering this, he would be glad andfull of joy. Or suppose a man were imprisoned, but later he would be released,safe and secure, with no loss to his property; on considering this, he would beglad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were a slave, not self-dependent butdependent on others, unable to go where he wants, but later on he would bereleased from slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a free man able togo where he wants; on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. Orsuppose a man with wealth and property were to enter a road across a desert, butlater on he would cross over the desert, safe and secure, with no loss to hisproperty; on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. So too, monks,while these five hindrances have not yet been abandoned in himself, a monk seesthem respectively as a debt, illness, a prison, slavery, and a road across adesert. But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself, he seesthat as freedom from debt, recovery from illness, release from prison, freedomfrom slavery, and a land of safety.15. “Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weakenwisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, heenters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought andexamination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. He makes the raptureand happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, sothat there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture andhappiness born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath man or a bath man’sapprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually withwater, kneads it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it, andpervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, a monkmakes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, andpervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is notpervaded by the rapture and happiness born of seclusion.16. “Again, monks, with the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters anddwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification ofmind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born ofconcentration. He makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench,steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole bodythat is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. Just asthough there were a lake whose waters welled up from below and it had no inflowfrom east, west, north, or south, and would not be replenished from time to timeby showers of rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake wouldmake the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that therewould be no part of the whole lake that is not pervaded by cool water; so too, amonk makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill,and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is notpervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration.17. “Again, monks, with the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimousand, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body;he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He isequanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ He makes the happiness divested ofrapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part ofhis whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. Justas, in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born andgrow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, andcool water drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and theirroots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses that is not pervaded bycool water; so too, a monk makes the happiness divested of rapture drench,steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole bodythat is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture.18. “Again, monks, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with theprevious disappearance of joy and dejection, a monk enters upon and dwells inthe fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulnessdue to equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so thatthere is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind.Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth,so that there would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by thewhite cloth; so too, a monk sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, sothat there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure brightmind.19. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilements, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects hismanifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births … [as in preceding text,§23] … Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold pastlives. Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and thenback again to his own village, he might think: ‘I went from my own village tothat village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in sucha way, kept silent in such a way; and from that village I went to that othervillage, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such away, kept silent in such a way; and from that village I came back again to myown village.’ So too, a monk recollects his manifold past lives.… Thus withtheir aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.20. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilements, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings ... [as inpreceding text, §24] ... Thus with the divine eye, which is purified andsurpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior andsuperior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands howbeings pass on according to their actions. Just as though there were two houseswith doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw peopleentering the houses and coming out and passing to and fro, so too, with thedivine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a monk sees beingspassing away and being reborn ... and he understands how beings pass onaccording to their actions.21. “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid ofdefilements, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, hedirects it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as itactually is: ‘This is suffering’ ... [as in preceding text, §§25–26] … Heunderstands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had tobe done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’“Just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, andundisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could seeshells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting,he might think: ‘There is this lake, clear, limpid, and undisturbed, and thereare these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimmingabout and resting.’ So too, a monk understands as it actually is: ‘This issuffering.’… He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state ofbeing.’”(from MN 39: Mahā Assapura Sutta; I 274–80)"},{"pageContent":"VIII. Mastering the Mind013 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_013_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONHaving presented a broad overview of the world-transcending path in the previouschapter, in this chapter and the next I intend to focus more specifically on twoaspects of this path as described in the Nikāyas, meditation and wisdom. As wehave seen, the gradual training is divided into the three sections of moraldiscipline, concentration, and wisdom (see pp. 225–26). Moral discipline beginswith the observance of precepts, which anchor one’s actions in principles ofconscientious behavior and moral restraint. The undertaking of precepts—for theNikāyas, particularly the full code of monastic precepts—is called the trainingin the higher moral discipline (adhisīlasikkhā). Moral discipline,consistently observed, infuses the mind with the purifying force of moralvirtue, generating joy and deeper confidence in the Dhamma.Established upon moral discipline, the disciple takes up the practice ofmeditation, intended to stabilize the mind and clear away the obstacles to theunfolding of wisdom. Because meditation elevates the mind beyond its normallevel, this phase of practice is called the training in the higher mind(adhicittasikkhā). Because it brings inner stillness and quietude, it is alsocalled the development of serenity (samathabh̄van̄). Successful practice resultsin deep concentration or mental unification (samādhi), also known as internalserenity of mind (ajjhattạ cetosamatha ). The most eminent types ofconcentration recognized in the Nikāyas are the four jhānas, which constituteright concentration (samm̄ sam̄dhi) of the Noble Eightfold Path. Beyond thejhānas lie the four formless attainments (ar̄pasam̄patti), which carry theprocess of mental unification to still subtler levels.The third stage of practice is the training in the higher wisdom(adhipaññāsikkhā), designed to awaken direct insight into the true nature ofthings as disclosed by the Buddha’s teaching. This will be dealt with in detailin the following chapter.The first selection below, Text VIII,1, is a miscellany of short epigrams thatstress the need for mental cultivation. The sayings occur in pairs. In eachpair, the first member signals the dangers of the uncultivated mind, the secondextols the benefits of the cultivated mind. The uncultivated mind is easy preyto the defilements—greed, hatred, and delusion and their offshoots. Thedefilements generate unwholesome kamma, which brings painful results both inthis life and in future lives. Since the defilements are the cause of oursuffering and bondage, the path to liberation necessarily involves a meticulousprocess of mental training intended to subdue them and ultimately uproot themfrom their nesting place in the deep recesses of the mind. From development ofthe mind arise happiness, freedom, and peace.Development of the mind, for the Nikāyas, means the development of serenity(samatha) and insight (vipassanā). Text VIII,2(1) says that when serenity isdeveloped, it leads to concentration and the liberation of the mind from suchemotional defilements as lust and ill will. When insight is developed, it leadsto the higher wisdom of insight into the true nature of phenomena andpermanently liberates the mind from ignorance. Thus the two things most neededto master the mind are serenity and insight.Since concentration is the basis for wisdom, the Nikāyas usually treat thedevelopment of serenity as the precursor to the development of insight. However,because the aptitudes of meditators differ, several suttas allow for alternativeapproaches to this sequence. Text VIII,2(2) speaks of four approaches to mentalcultivation:1. The first approach, the classical one, is to develop serenity first andinsight afterward. By “serenity” is meant the jhānas or (according to the Pālicommentaries) a state bordering on the jhānas called “access” or “threshold”concentration (upacārasamādhi).2. A second approach is to develop insight first and serenity afterward. Sincethere can be no real insight without concentration, such meditators—presumablypeople with sharp intellectual faculties—must initially use concentration as thebasis for acquiring insight into the true characteristics of phenomena. However,it seems that such concentration, though sufficient for insight, is not strongenough to allow for a breakthrough to the supramundane path. These meditatorsmust therefore return to the task of unifying the mind before resuming the workof insight. Such insight, based on concentration, culminates in the supramundanepath.3. A third approach is to develop serenity and insight in tandem. Meditators whotake this approach first attain a particular level of concentration, such as ajh̄na or formless attainment, and then employ it as a basis for insight. Havingdeveloped insight, they then return to concentration, attain a different jhānaor formless attainment, and use that as a basis for insight. Thus they proceeduntil they reach the supramundane path.4. The description of the fourth approach is somewhat obscure. The sutta saysthat “a monk’s mind is seized by agitation about the teachings,” and then, sometime later, he gains concentration and attains the supramundane path. Thisstatement suggests a person initially driven by such intense desire tounderstand the Dhamma that he or she cannot focus clearly upon any meditationobject. Later, with the aid of certain supporting conditions, this personmanages to subdue the mind, gain concentration, and attain the supramundanepath.Text VIII,2(3) again confirms that both serenity and insight are necessary, andalso indicates the skills needed for their respective practice. The cultivationof serenity requires skill in steadying, composing, unifying, and concentratingthe mind. The cultivation of insight requires skill in observing, investigating,and discerning conditioned phenomena, spoken of as “formations” (saṅkhārā).In line with the preceding text, this sutta confirms that some meditators beginby developing internal serenity of mind, others by developing the higher wisdomof insight into phenomena, others by developing both in tandem. But whilemeditators may start off differently, eventually they must all strike a healthybalance between serenity and insight. The exact point of balance between the twowill differ from one person to another, but when a meditator achieves theappropriate balance, serenity and insight join forces to issue in the knowledgeand vision of the Four Noble Truths. This knowledge and vision—theworld-transcending wisdom—occurs in four distinct “installments,” the fourstages of realization which, in sequence, permanently destroy ignorance alongwith the affiliated defilements.1 Text VIII,2(2) subsumes these defilementsunder the expression “the fetters and underlying tendencies.”The main impediments to the development of serenity and insight are collectivelycalled the “five hindrances,” which we already met in the extended account ofthe gradual training (see Text VII,4 §18). Text VIII,3 states that just asdifferent impurities of water prevent us from clearly seeing the reflection ofour face in a bowl of water, so the five hindrances prevent us from properlyunderstanding our own good and the good of others. A meditator’s initial effortstherefore have to be devoted to the task of overcoming the hindrances. Oncethese are overcome, success is assured in the practice of serenity and insight.Text VIII,4 compares the successive stages in the purification of the mind tothe refinement of gold. The meditating monk begins by removing the grossimpurities of bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; this is achieved by moraldiscipline and vigilant introspection. Then he eliminates the middle-levelimpurities of unwholesome thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, ill will, andharmfulness. Next come the subtle impurities of meandering thoughts. Finally, hemust eliminate thoughts about the Dhamma, the subtlest obstacle. When all suchdistracting thoughts are removed, the monk attains “mental unification”(ekodibhāva), the basis for the six “direct knowledges” (abhiññā) culminatingin arahantship, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints.The Nikāyas sometimes compare the process of training the mind to the taming ofa wild animal. Just as an animal trainer has to use various techniques to bringthe animal under control, the meditator has to draw upon various methods tosubdue the mind. It is not enough to be acquainted with one meditationtechnique; one must be skilled in a number of methods intended as antidotes tospecific mental obstructions. In Text VIII,5 the Buddha explains five ancillarytechniques—here called “signs” (nimitta)—that a monk might deploy to eliminateunwholesome thoughts connected with lust, hatred, and delusion. One who succeedsin overcoming distracting thoughts by the use of these techniques is called “amaster of the courses of thought.”The suttas teach various techniques of meditation aimed at inducingconcentration. One popular formula pits specific meditation subjects against theunwholesome mental states they are intended to rectify. Thus the meditation onthe unattractive nature of the body (see Text VIII,8 §10) is the remedy forsensual lust; loving-kindness is the remedy for ill will; mindfulness ofbreathing is the remedy for restlessness; and the perception of impermanence isthe remedy for the conceit “I am.”2 The perception of impermanence is a subjectof insight meditation, the other three subjects of serenity meditation.Loving-kindness is the first of the four divine abodes (brahmavihāra) orimmeasurable states (appamaññā) briefly discussed in chapter V: boundlessloving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. These arerespectively the antidotes to ill will, harmfulness, discontent, and partiality.Since we already introduced the standard canonical passage on the divine abodesin connection with meditation as a basis for merit—see Text V,5(2)—to shed adifferent spotlight on this practice I have included here, as Text VIII,6, thefamous Simile of the Saw, a passage that shows loving-kindness in action.Through the centuries the most popular meditation subjects among lay Buddhistshave probably been the six recollections (anussati): of the Buddha, the Dhamma,the Saṅgha, morality, generosity, and the devas. Text VIII,7 is an importantcanonical source for these meditations. Their themes are especially close to thehearts and everyday experiences of people living household lives in a cultureimbued with Buddhist values. These meditation practices in turn enrich anduplift their lives, bringing them into closer spiritual contact with the idealsof religious faith. The first three are primarily devotional recollections thatbuild upon confidence in the Three Jewels; but while they begin with faith, theytemporarily cleanse the mind of defilements and conduce to sustainedconcentration. The meditation on moral discipline develops from one’s observanceof the precepts, a practice aimed at self-benefit; the recollection ofgenerosity builds upon one’s practice of giving, an altruistic practice; therecollection of the devas is a contemplation of the fruits of one’s faith,morality, generosity, and wisdom as they mature in future lives.The discourse generally considered to offer the most comprehensive instructionson meditation practice is the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.3 Two versions of this suttaexist, a longer version in the Dīgha Nikāya, a middle-length version in theMajjhima Nikāya. The former differs from the latter only by its extendedanalysis of the Four Noble Truths, which may have originally been an earlycommentary incorporated into the discourse. The middle-length version isincluded here as Text VIII,8. An entire chapter in the Saṃyutta Nikāya, theSatipaṭṭhānasaṃyutta, is also devoted to this system of meditation.The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta does not recommend a single meditation subject noreven a single method of meditation. Its purpose, rather, is to explain how toestablish the mode of contemplation needed to arrive at realization of Nibbāna.The appropriate frame of mind to be established, as implied by the title of thesutta, is called an “establishment of mindfulness.” The word satipaṭṭhānashould probably be understood as a compound of sati, mindfulness, andupaṭṭhāna, establishment; hence “establishment of mindfulness” would be therendering that best captures the original meaning. According to the standardformula that accompanies each exercise, a satipaṭṭhāna is a mode of dwelling(viharati). This mode of dwelling involves observation of objects in the properframe of mind. The frame of mind consists of three positive qualities: energy(ātāpa, “ardor”), mindfulness (sati), and clear comprehension (sampajañña).The word sati originally meant memory, but in the present context it signifiesrecollection of the present, a sustained awareness of what is happening to usand within us on each occasion of experience. Mindfulness, in its initialstages, is concerned with keeping the contemplative mind continually on itsobject, which means keeping the object continually present to the mind.Mindfulness prevents the mind from slipping away, from drifting off under thesway of random thoughts into mental proliferation and forgetfulness. Mindfulnessis often said to occur in close conjunction with “clear comprehension,” a clearknowledge and understanding of what one is experiencing.The opening formula of the sutta says that one engages in this practice after“having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world” (vineyya lokeabhijjhā-domanassaṃ). The expression “having subdued” need not be taken toimply that one must first overcome longing and dejection—which, according to thecommentary, signify greed and aversion and thus represent the fivehindrances—before one can start to practice satipaṭṭhāna. The expressionmight be understood to mean that the practice is itself the means of overcominglonging and dejection. Thus, while subduing the obstructive influences of greedand aversion, the meditator arouses the positive qualities of energy,mindfulness, and clear comprehension, and contemplates four objective domains:the body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena. It is these four objectivedomains that differentiate mindful observation into four establishments ofmindfulness.The four objective domains divide the expository portion of the SatipaṭṭhānaSutta into four major sections. Two of these sections, the first and the fourth,have several subdivisions. When the divisions are added up, we obtain altogethertwenty-one meditation subjects. Several of these can be used as means to developserenity (samatha), but the satipaṭṭhāna system as a whole seems especiallydesigned for the development of insight. The main sections with their divisionsare as follows:1. Contemplation of the body (kāyānupassanā). This comprises fourteensubjects of meditation: mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the fourpostures; clear comprehension of activities; attention to the unattractivenature of the body (viewed by way of its organs and tissues); attention to theelements; and nine charnel ground contemplations, contemplations based oncorpses in different stages of decomposition.2. Contemplation of feeling (vedanānupassanā). Feeling is differentiated intothree primary types—pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant—whichare each further distinguished into carnal and spiritual feelings. However,because these are all merely different types of feeling, the contemplation offeeling is considered one subject.3. Contemplation of mind (cittānupassanā). This is one subject ofcontemplation—the mind—differentiated into eight pairs of contrasting states ofmind.4. Contemplation of phenomena (dhammānupassanā). The word dhammā hereprobably signifies phenomena, which are classified into five categories governedby the Buddha’s teaching, the Dhamma. Thus dhammānupassanā has a dual meaning,“dhammas (phenomena) contemplated by way of the Dhamma (the teaching).” The fivecategories are: the five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six internal andexternal sense bases, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the Four NobleTruths.Although not specified in the sutta, a progressive sequence seems to be impliedby the terms describing each contemplation. In mindfulness of breathing onemoves to subtler levels of quiescence; in contemplation of feeling, one movestoward noncarnal feelings that are neither painful nor pleasant; incontemplation of mind, one moves toward states of mind that are concentrated andliberated. These all suggest that progressive contemplation brings enhancedconcentration. In the contemplation of phenomena, the emphasis shifts towardinsight. One begins by observing and overcoming the five hindrances. Theovercoming of the hindrances marks success in concentration. With theconcentrated mind, one contemplates the five aggregates and the six sense bases.As contemplation gains momentum, the seven factors of enlightenment becomemanifest, and the development of the seven enlightenment factors culminates inknowledge of the Four Noble Truths. Knowledge of the Four Noble Truths liberatesthe mind from the defilements and thus leads to the attainment of Nibbāna. Thusthis system of meditation fulfills the potential ascribed to it by the Buddha ofleading directly to the realization of Nibbāna.Each major contemplative exercise is supplemented by an auxiliary section, a“refrain” with four subdivisions. The first states that the meditatorcontemplates the object internally (within his or her own experience),externally (reflectively considering it as occurring within the experience ofothers), and both; this ensures that one obtains a comprehensive and balancedview of the object. The second portion states that the meditator contemplatesthe object as subject to origination, as subject to vanishing, and as subject toboth origination and vanishing; this brings to light the characteristic ofimpermanence and thus leads to insight into the three characteristics:impermanence, suffering, and nonself (anicca, dukkha, anattā). The third statesthat the meditator is simply aware of the bare object to the extent necessaryfor constant mindfulness and knowledge. And the fourth describes the meditatoras dwelling in a state of complete detachment, not clinging to anything in theworld.In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati) isincluded as merely one meditation subject among others, but the Nikāyas assignit a position of fundamental importance. The Buddha said that he usedmindfulness of breathing as his main meditation subject for the attainment ofenlightenment (see SN 54:8; V 317). During his teaching career he occasionallywent into seclusion to devote himself to “the concentration gained throughmindfulness of breathing” and he confers on it a unique honor by calling it “theTathāgata’s dwelling” (SN 54:11; V 326).Mindfulness of breathing is the subject of an entire chapter in the SaṃyuttaNikāya (SN 54, Ānāpānasaṃyutta). Whereas the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta explainsmindfulness of breathing by a four-step formula, the suttas in this collectionexpand its practice to sixteen steps. Text VIII,9, from the Ānāpānasaṃyutta,describes the sixteen steps. Since these steps are not necessarily sequentialbut partly overlap, they might be thought of as facets rather than actual steps.The sixteen facets are grouped into four tetrads each of which corresponds toone of the four establishments of mindfulness. The first tetrad contains thefour facets mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta in its section oncontemplation of the body, but the other tetrads extend the practice to thecontemplations of feelings, mind, and phenomena. Thus the development ofmindfulness of breathing can fulfill not just one but all four establishments ofmindfulness. The four establishments of mindfulness, based on mindfulness ofbreathing, in turn fulfill the seven factors of enlightenment; and these in turnfulfill true knowledge and liberation. This exposition thus shows mindfulness ofbreathing to be a complete subject of meditation that begins with simpleattention to the breath and culminates in the permanent liberation of the mind.Finally, in Text VIII,10, the Buddha’s chief disciple, the Venerable Sāriputta,testifies to his own achievement of mastery over the mind. In reply to questionsfrom the Venerable Ānanda, he explains how he is able to dwell for a whole dayin each of the jhānas and formless attainments, as well as in the specialattainment called the cessation of perception and feeling(saññāvedayitanirodha). In each case, because he is an arahant, he can do sowithout grasping these attainments with thoughts of “I” and “mine.”VIII. MASTERING THE MIND1. THE MIND IS THE KEY1. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that is so unwieldy as anundeveloped mind. An undeveloped mind is truly unwieldy.2. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that is so wieldy as adeveloped mind. A developed mind is truly wieldy.3. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that leads to such greatharm as an undeveloped mind. An undeveloped mind leads to great harm.4. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that leads to such greatbenefit as a developed mind. A developed mind leads to great benefit.9. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that when undeveloped anduncultivated entails such great suffering as the mind. The mind when undevelopedand uncultivated entails great suffering.10. “I do not perceive even one other thing, O monks, that when developed andcultivated entails such great happiness as the mind. The mind when developed andcultivated entails great happiness.”1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en131]2[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en132]3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en133](AN 1: iii, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10; I5–6)2. DEVELOPING A PAIR OF SKILLS(1) SERENITY AND INSIGHT“Two things, O monks, partake of true knowledge. What two? Serenity and insight.“When serenity is developed, what benefit does one experience? The mind isdeveloped. When the mind is developed, what benefit does one experience? Alllust is abandoned.4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en134]“When insight is developed, what benefit does one experience? Wisdom isdeveloped. When wisdom is developed, what benefit does one experience? Allignorance is abandoned.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en135]“A mind defiled by lust is not liberated; and wisdom defiled by ignorance is notdeveloped. Thus, monks, through the fading away of lust there is liberation ofmind; and through the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdom.”6[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en136](AN 2: iii, 10; I 61)(2) FOUR WAYS TO ARAHANTSHIPThus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling atKosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the monksthus:“Friends!”“Yes, friend,” the monks replied. Thereupon the Venerable Ānanda said:“Friends, whatever monks or nuns declare before me that they have attained thefinal knowledge of arahantship, all these do so in one of four ways. What four?“Here, friends, a monk develops insight preceded by serenity.7[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en137] While he thus developsinsight preceded by serenity, the path arises in him. He now pursues, develops,and cultivates that path, and while he is doing so the fetters are abandoned andthe underlying tendencies eliminated.8[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en138]“Or again, friends, a monk develops serenity preceded by insight.9[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en139] While he thus developsserenity preceded by insight, the path arises in him. He now pursues, develops,and cultivates that path, and while he is doing so the fetters are abandoned andthe underlying tendencies eliminated.“Or again, friends, a monk develops serenity and insight joined in pairs.10[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en140] While he thus developsserenity and insight joined in pairs, the path arises in him. He now pursues,develops, and cultivates that path, and while he is doing so the fetters areabandoned and the underlying tendencies eliminated.“Or again, friends, a monk’s mind is seized by agitation about the teaching.11[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en141] But there comes a time whenhis mind becomes internally steadied, composed, unified, and concentrated; thenthe path arises in him. He now pursues, develops, and cultivates that path, andwhile he is doing so the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencieseliminated.“Friends, whatever monks or nuns declare before me that they have attained thefinal knowledge of arahantship, all these do so in one of these four ways.”(AN 4:170; II 156–57)(3) FOUR KINDS OF PERSONS“These four kinds of persons, O monks, are found existing in the world. Whatfour?“Here, monks, a certain person gains internal serenity of mind but does not gainthe higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.12[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en142] Another person gains thehigher wisdom of insight into phenomena but does not gain internal serenity ofmind. Another person gains neither internal serenity of mind nor the higherwisdom of insight into phenomena. And another person gains both internalserenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.“Therein, monks, the person who gains internal serenity of mind but not thehigher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains the higherwisdom and inquire of him: ‘How, friend, should formations be seen? How shouldformations be explored? How should formations be discerned with insight?’13[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en143] The other then answers himas he has seen and understood the matter thus: ‘Formations should be seen insuch a way; they should be explored in such a way; they should be discerned withinsight in such a way.’ At a later time this one gains both internal serenity ofmind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.“Therein, monks, the person who gains the higher wisdom of insight intophenomena but not internal serenity of mind should approach one who gainsinternal serenity and inquire of him: ‘How, friend, should the mind be steadied?How should the mind be composed? How should the mind be unified? How should themind be concentrated? ’ The other then answers him as he has seen and understoodthe matter thus: ‘The mind should be steadied in such a way, composed in such away, unified in such a way, concentrated in such a way.’ At a later time thisone gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight intophenomena.“Therein, monks, the person who gains neither internal serenity of mind nor thehigher wisdom of insight into phenomena should approach one who gains both andinquire of him: ‘How, friend, should the mind be steadied?… How, friend, shouldformations be seen?…’ The other then answers him as he has seen and understoodthe matter thus: ‘The mind should be steadied in such a way…. Formations shouldbe seen in such a way.…’ At a later time this one gains both internal serenityof mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.“Therein, monks, the person who gains both internal serenity of mind and thehigher wisdom of insight into phenomena should establish himself in just thesewholesome states and make a further effort for the destruction of the taints.”(AN 4:94; II 93–95)3. THE HINDRANCES TO MENTAL DEVELOPMENTThen the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetingswith him, sat down to one side, and said:“Master Gotama, why is it that sometimes even those texts that have been recitedover a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not beenrecited? And why is it that sometimes those texts that have not been recitedover a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been recited?”“Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sensual lust, overwhelmed bysensual lust, and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisensensual lust,14 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en144] on thatoccasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is one’s own good, or the goodof others, or the good of both.

So too,brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed by doubt ... even those texts thathave been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone thosethat have not been recited.“This, brahmin, is the reason why even those texts that have been recited over along period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not beenrecited.“Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind that is not obsessed by sensual lust, illwill, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt, on thatoccasion even those texts that have not been recited over a long period recur tothe mind, let alone those that have been recited.“Suppose, brahmin, there is a bowl of water that is not mixed with dyes; notbubbling and boiling; not covered over with water plants and algae; not stirredby the wind and churned into wavelets; clear, serene, limpid, set out in thelight. If a man with good sight were to examine his own facial reflection in it,he would know and see it as it really is. So too, brahmin, when one dwells witha mind that is not obsessed by sensual lust, ill will, dullness and drowsiness,restlessness and remorse, and doubt on that occasion even those texts that havenot been recited over a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that havebeen recited.“This, brahmin, is the reason why even those texts that have not been recitedover a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been recited.”…When this was said, the brahmin Saṅgārava said to the Blessed One:“Magnificent, Master Gotama!… Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower whohas gone for refuge from today until life’s end.”(SN 46:55, abridged; V 121–26)4. THE REFINEMENT OF THE MIND“There are, O monks, gross impurities in gold, such as earth and sand, graveland grit. Now the goldsmith or his apprentice first pours the gold into a troughand washes, rinses, and cleans it thoroughly. When he has done this, there stillremain moderate impurities in the gold, such as fine grit and coarse sand. Thenthe goldsmith or his apprentice washes, rinses, and cleans it again. When he hasdone this, there still remain minute impurities in the gold, such as fine sandand black dust. Now the goldsmith or his apprentice repeats the washing, andthereafter only the gold dust remains.“He now pours the gold into a melting pot, smelts it, and melts it together. Buthe does not yet take it out from the vessel, as the dross has not yet beenentirely removed and the gold is not yet quite pliant, workable, and bright; itis still brittle and does not yet lend itself easily to molding. But a timecomes when the goldsmith or his apprentice repeats the melting thoroughly, sothat the flaws are entirely removed. The gold is now quite pliant, workable, andbright, and it lends itself easily to molding. Whatever ornament the goldsmithnow wishes to make of it, be it a diadem, earrings, a necklace, or a goldenchain, the gold can now be used for that purpose.“It is similar, monks, with a monk devoted to the training in the higher mind:there are in him gross impurities, namely, bad conduct of body, speech, andmind. Such conduct an earnest, capable monk abandons, dispels, eliminates, andabolishes.“When he has abandoned these, there are still impurities of a moderate degreethat cling to him, namely, sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughtsof harming.15 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en145] Such thoughtsan earnest, capable monk abandons, dispels, eliminates, and abolishes.“When he has abandoned these, there are still some subtle impurities that clingto him, namely, thoughts about his relatives, his home country, and hisreputation. Such thoughts an earnest, capable monk abandons dispels, eliminates,and abolishes.“When he has abandoned these, there still remain thoughts about the teaching.16[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en146] That concentration is notyet peaceful and sublime; it has not attained to full tranquillity, nor has itachieved mental unification; it is maintained by strenuous suppression of thedefilements.“But there comes a time when his mind becomes inwardly steadied, composed,unified, and concentrated. That concentration is then calm and refined; it hasattained to full tranquillity and achieved mental unification; it is notmaintained by strenuous suppression of the defilements.“Then, to whatever mental state realizable by direct knowledge he directs hismind, he achieves the capacity of realizing that state by direct knowledge,whenever the necessary conditions obtain.17[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en147]“If he wishes: ‘May I wield the various kinds of spiritual power: having beenone, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I appear andvanish; go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain asif through space; dive in and out of the earth as if it were water; walk onwater without sinking as if it were earth; travel through the sky like a birdwhile seated cross-legged; touch and stroke with my hand the moon and sun, sopowerful and mighty; exercise mastery with my body even as far as the brahmaworld’—he achieves the capacity of realizing that state by direct knowledge,whenever the necessary conditions obtain.“If he wishes: ‘With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses thehuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are faras well as near’—he achieves the capacity of realizing that state by directknowledge, whenever the necessary conditions obtain.“If he wishes: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings, of other persons,having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand a mind with lust as amind with lust; a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatredas a mind with hatred; a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mindwith delusion as a mind with delusion; a mind without delusion as a mind withoutdelusion; a contracted mind as contracted, and a distracted mind as distracted;an exalted mind as exalted, and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassablemind as surpassable, and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentratedmind as concentrated, and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberatedmind as liberated, and an unliberated mind as unliberated’—he achieves thecapacity of realizing that state by direct knowledge, whenever the necessaryconditions obtain.“If he wishes, ‘May I recollect my manifold past lives … [see Text II,3(2)§38] …with their modes and details’—he achieves the capacity of realizing that stateby direct knowledge, whenever the necessary conditions obtain.“If he wishes, ‘With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,may I see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautifuland ugly, fortunate and unfortunate … [see Text II,3(2)§40] … and understand howbeings fare on in accordance with their action’—he achieves the capacity ofrealizing that state by direct knowledge, whenever the necessary conditionsobtain.“If he wishes, ‘By the destruction of the taints, may I in this very life enterand dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizingit for myself with direct knowledge’—he achieves the capacity of realizing thatstate by direct knowledge, whenever the necessary conditions obtain.”(AN 3:100 §§1–10; I 253–56)5. THE REMOVAL OF DISTRACTING THOUGHTS1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the monks thus:“Monks.”—“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:2. “Monks, when a monk is pursuing the higher mind, from time to time he shouldgive attention to five signs.18[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en148] What are the five?3. (i) “Here, monks, when a monk is giving attention to some sign, and owing tothat sign there arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,hate, and delusion, then he should give attention to some other sign connectedwith what is wholesome.19 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en149]When he gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome,then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion areabandoned in him and subside. With their abandoning his mind becomes steadiedinternally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as a skilled carpenter orhis apprentice might knock out, remove, and extract a coarse peg by means of afine one, so too ... when a monk gives attention to some other sign connectedwith what is wholesome … his mind becomes steadied internally, composed,unified, and concentrated.4. (ii) “If, while he is giving attention to some other sign connected with whatis wholesome, there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected withdesire, hate, and delusion, then he should examine the danger in those thoughtsthus: ‘These thoughts are unwholesome, reprehensible, resulting in suffering.’When he examines the danger in those thoughts, then any evil unwholesomethoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion are abandoned in him andsubside. With their abandoning his mind becomes steadied internally, composed,unified, and concentrated. Just as a man or a woman, young, youthful, and fondof ornaments, would be horrified, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcass of asnake or a dog or a human being were hung around his or her neck, so too ...when a monk examines the danger in those thoughts … his mind becomes steadiedinternally, composed, unified, and concentrated.5. (iii) “If, while he is examining the danger in those thoughts, there stillarise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hate, anddelusion, then he should try to forget those thoughts and should not giveattention to them. When he tries to forget those thoughts and does not giveattention to them, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,hate, and delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With their abandoning hismind becomes steadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as aman with good eyes who did not want to see forms that had come within range ofsight would either shut his eyes or look away, so too ... when a monk tries toforget those thoughts and does not give attention to them ... his mind becomessteadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.6. (iv) “If, while he is trying to forget those thoughts and is not givingattention to them, there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connectedwith desire, hate, and delusion, then he should give attention to stilling thethought-formation of those thoughts.20[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en150] When he gives attention tostilling the thought-formation of those thoughts, then any evil unwholesomethoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion are abandoned in him andsubside. With their abandoning his mind becomes steadied internally, composed,unified, and concentrated. Just as a man walking fast might consider: ‘Why am Iwalking fast? What if I walk slowly?’ and he would walk slowly; then he mightconsider: ‘Why am I walking slowly? What if I stand?’ and he would stand; thenhe might consider: ‘Why am I standing? What if I sit?’ and he would sit; then hemight consider:‘Why am I sitting? What if I lie down?’ and he would lie down. By doing so hewould substitute for each grosser posture one that was subtler. So too ... whena monk gives attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts … hismind becomes steadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated.7. (v) “If, while he is giving attention to stilling the thought-formation ofthose thoughts, there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connectedwith desire, hate, and delusion, then, with his teeth clenched and his tonguepressed against the roof of his mouth, he should beat down, constrain, and crushmind with mind. When, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against theroof of his mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind, thenany evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion areabandoned in him and subside. With their abandoning his mind becomes steadiedinternally, composed, unified, and concentrated. Just as a strong man mightseize a weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down, constrain him,and crush him, so too ... when, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressedagainst the roof of his mouth, a monk beats down, constrains, and crushes mindwith mind ... his mind becomes steadied internally, composed, unified, andconcentrated.8. “Monks, when a monk is giving attention to some sign, and owing to that signthere arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hate, anddelusion, then when he gives attention to some other sign connected with what iswholesome, any such evil unwholesome thoughts are abandoned in him and subside,and with their abandoning his mind becomes steadied internally, composed,unified, and concentrated. When he examines the danger in those thoughts ... hismind becomes steadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. When hetries to forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them ... his mindbecomes steadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. When he givesattention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts … his mind becomessteadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. When, with his teethclenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, he beats down,constrains, and crushes mind with mind, any such evil unwholesome thoughts areabandoned in him and subside, and with their abandoning, his mind becomessteadied internally, composed, unified, and concentrated. This monk is thencalled a master of the courses of thought. He will think whatever thought hewishes to think and he will not think any thought that he does not wish tothink. He has severed craving, flung off the fetters, and with the completepenetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering.”That is what the Blessed One said. The monks were satisfied and delighted in theBlessed One’s words.(MN 20: Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta; I 118–22)6. THE MIND OF LOVING-KINDNESS11. “Monks, there are these five courses of speech that others may use when theyaddress you: their speech may be timely or untimely, true or untrue, gentle orharsh, connected with good or with harm, spoken with a mind of loving-kindnessor in a mood of hate. When others address you, their speech may be timely oruntimely; when others address you, their speech may be true or untrue; whenothers address you, their speech may be gentle or harsh; when others addressyou, their speech may be connected with good or with harm; when others addressyou, their speech may be spoken with a mind of loving-kindness or in a mood ofhate. Herein, monks, you should train thus: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected,and we shall utter no bitter words; we shall abide compassionate for theirwelfare, with a mind of loving-kindness, never in a mood of hate. We shall abidepervading that person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, and starting withthat person,21 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en151] we shallabide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued withloving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and withoutill will.’ That is how you should train, monks….20. “Monks, even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb with atwo-handled saw, he who gave rise to a mind of hate toward them would not becarrying out my teaching. Herein, monks, you should train thus: ‘Our minds willremain unaffected, and we shall utter no bitter words; we shall abidecompassionate for their welfare, with a mind of loving-kindness, never in a moodof hate. We shall abide pervading them with a mind imbued with loving-kindness;and starting with them, we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing world witha mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, withouthostility, and without ill will.’ That is how you should train, monks.21. “Monks, if you keep this advice on the simile of the saw constantly in mind,do you see any course of speech, trivial or gross, that you could notendure?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“Therefore, monks, you should keep this advice onthe simile of the saw constantly in mind. That will lead to your welfare andhappiness for a long time.”(from MN 21: Kakacūpama Sutta; I 126–27, 129)7. THE SIX RECOLLECTIONSOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan-treeMonastery. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage tohim, sat down to one side, and said: 22[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en152]“Venerable sir, in what way does a noble disciple often dwell when he hasarrived at the fruit and understood the teaching?”23[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en153]“When, Mahānāma, a noble disciple has arrived at the fruit and understood theteaching, he often dwells in such a way as this. Here, a noble disciplerecollects the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectlyenlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower ofthe world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas andhumans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ When a noble disciple recollectsthe Tathāgata thus, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred,or delusion; his mind is straight, with the Tathāgata as its object. A nobledisciple whose mind is straight gains the inspiration of the meaning, theinspiration of the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he isgladdened rapture arises; for one uplifted by rapture the body becomes calm; onecalm in body feels happy; for one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated.This is called a noble disciple who dwells evenly amid an uneven population, whodwells without affliction amid an afflicted population, who has entered upon thestream of the Dhamma and develops recollection of the Buddha.“Further, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhammais well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting oneto come and see, worthy of application, to be personally experienced by thewise.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus, on that occasion hismind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; his mind is straight, withthe Dhamma as its object.… This is called a noble disciple who dwells evenlyamid an uneven population, who dwells without affliction amid an afflictedpopulation, who has entered upon the stream of the Dhamma and developsrecollection of the Dhamma.“Further, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha thus: ‘The Saṅghaof the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, practicing thestraight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, thefour pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this Saṅgha of theBlessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy ofofferings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit forthe world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha thus, on that occasionhis mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; his mind is straight,with the Saṅgha as its object.… This is called a noble disciple who dwellsevenly amid an uneven population, who dwells without affliction amid anafflicted population, who has entered upon the stream of the Dhamma and developsrecollection of the Saṅgha.“Further, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own moral discipline thus:‘I possess the moral virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken, untorn,unblemished, unmottled, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading toconcentration.’ When a noble disciple recollects his own moral discipline thus,on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; his mindis straight, with virtue as its object.… This is called a noble disciple whodwells evenly amid an uneven population, who dwells without affliction amid anafflicted population, who has entered upon the stream of the Dhamma and developsrecollection of moral discipline.“Further, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own generosity thus: ‘Itis a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that in a population obsessed by thestain of stinginess, I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain ofstinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, onedevoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. ’ When a noble disciplerecollects his own generosity thus, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed bylust, hatred, or delusion; his mind is straight, with generosity as its object.…This is called a noble disciple who dwells evenly amid an uneven population, whodwells without affliction amid an afflicted population, who has entered upon thestream of the Dhamma and develops recollection of generosity.“Further, Mahānāma, a noble disciple develops the recollection of the devasthus: ‘There are devas in the various heavenly realms.24[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en154] There is found in me suchfaith, moral discipline, learning, generosity, and wisdom as those devaspossessed because of which, when they passed away from this world, they werereborn there.’ When a noble disciple recollects his own faith, moral discipline,learning, generosity, and wisdom, as well as those of the devas, on thatoccasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; his mind isstraight, with the devas as its object.… This is called a noble disciple whodwells evenly amid an uneven population, who dwells without affliction amid anafflicted population, who has entered upon the stream of the Dhamma and developsrecollection of the devas.“A noble disciple, Mahānāma, who has arrived at the fruit and understood theteaching often dwells in just this way.”(AN 6:10; III 284–88)8. THE FOUR ESTABLISHMENTS OF MINDFULNESS1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kurucountry where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There headdressed the monks thus: “Monks.”—“Venerable sir,” they replied. The BlessedOne said this:2. “Monks, this is the one-way path25[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en155] for the purification ofbeings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away ofpain and dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization ofNibbāna—namely, the four establishments of mindfulness.3. “What are the four? Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the body in thebody, ardent, clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing anddejection in regard to the world.26[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en156] He dwells contemplatingfeelings in feelings, ardent, clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subduedlonging and dejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating mind inmind, ardent, clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing anddejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating phenomena inphenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longingand dejection in regard to the world.27[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en157][CONTEMPLATION OF THE BODY][1. MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING]4. “And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating the body in the body? Here amonk, gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down;having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body, and establishedmindfulness in front of him, just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathesout. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing outlong, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands:‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe outshort.’28 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en158] He trains thus:‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I will breatheout experiencing the whole body.’29[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en159] He trains thus: ‘I willbreathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I will breatheout tranquilizing the bodily formation.’30[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en160] Just as a skilledlathe-worker or his apprentice, when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make along turn’; or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’; sotoo, breathing in long, a monk understands: ‘I breathe in long’ ... he trainsthus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation.’5. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or hedwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplatingthe body in the body both internally and externally.31[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en161] Or else he dwellscontemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating inthe body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body itsnature of both arising and vanishing.32[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en162] Or else mindfulness that‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bareknowledge and repeated mindfulness. And he dwells independent, not clinging toanything in the world. That is how a monk dwells contemplating the body in thebody.[2. THE FOUR POSTURES]6. “Again, monks, when walking, a monk understands: ‘I am walking’; whenstanding, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when sitting, he understands: ‘I amsitting’; when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understandsaccordingly however his body is disposed.33[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en163]7. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally,externally, and both internally and externally.… And he dwells independent, notclinging to anything in the world. That too is how a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body.[3. CLEAR COMPREHENSION]8. “Again, monks, a monk is one who acts with clear comprehension when goingforward and returning;34 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en164]who acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking away; who actswith clear comprehension when bending and stretching his limbs; who acts withclear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl;who acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting;who acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating; who acts withclear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up,talking, and keeping silent.9. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally,externally, and both internally and externally.… And he dwells independent, notclinging to anything in the world. That too is how a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body.[4. UNATTRACTIVENESS OF THE BODY]10. “Again, monks, a monk reviews this same body up from the soles of the feetand down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin, as full of many kinds ofimpurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth,skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm,spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood,sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.’35[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en165] Just as though there were abag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as hill rice,red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyes were toopen it and review it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these arebeans, these are peas, this is millet, this is white rice’; so too, a monkreviews this same body … as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this bodythere are head-hairs … and urine.’11. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally,externally, and both internally and externally.… And he dwells independent, notclinging to anything in the world. That too is how a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body.[5. ELEMENTS]12. “Again, monks, a monk reviews this same body, however it is placed, howeverdisposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are the earthelement, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’36[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en166] Just as though a skilledbutcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroadswith it cut up into pieces; so too, a monk reviews this same body … asconsisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, thewater element, the fire element, and the air element.’13. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally,externally, and both internally and externally.… And he dwells independent, notclinging to anything in the world. That too is how a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body.[6–14. THE NINE CHARNEL GROUND CONTEMPLATIONS]14. “Again, monks, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnelground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter, a monkcompares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, itwill be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’37[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en167]15. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally,externally, and both internally and externally.… And he dwells independent, notclinging to anything in the world. That too is how a monk dwells contemplatingthe body in the body.16. “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground,being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or various kinds ofworms, a monk compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of thesame nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’17. “…That too is how a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body.18–24. “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnelground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews…afleshlessskeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews…a skeleton without fleshand blood, held together with sinews … disconnected bones scattered in alldirections—here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there athigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a back-bone, here the skull—a monk comparesthis same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will belike that, it is not exempt from that fate.’38[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en168]25. “…That too is how a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body.26–30. “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnelground, bones bleached white, the color of shells … bones heaped up … bones morethan a year old, rotted and crumbled to dust, a monk compares this same bodywith it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it isnot exempt from that fate.’31. “In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or hedwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplatingthe body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwellscontemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating inthe body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body itsnature of both arising and vanishing.

MINDFULNESS OF BREATHINGAt Sāvatthī, the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage tohim, sat down to one side, and said: “Venerable sir, is there one thing which,when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things? And four things which, whendeveloped and cultivated, fulfill seven things? And seven things which, whendeveloped and cultivated, fulfill two things?”“There is, Ānanda, one thing which, when developed and cultivated, fulfillsfour things; and four things which, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seventhings; and seven things which, when developed and cultivated, fulfill twothings.”“But, venerable sir, what is the one thing which, when developed and cultivated,fulfills four things; and the four things which, when developed and cultivated,fulfill seven things; and the seven things which, when developed and cultivated,fulfill two things?”“Concentration by mindfulness of breathing, Ānanda, is the one thing which,when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four establishments of mindfulness.The four establishments of mindfulness, when developed and cultivated, fulfillthe seven factors of enlightenment.

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MASTERYOn one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthī inJeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.62[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_008.html#en192] Then one morning he dressedand, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. When he had walked foralms in Sāvatthī and had returned from the almsround, after his meal he wentto the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the BlindMen’s Grove, he sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion and wentto Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Shining the Light of Wisdom014 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_014_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONThe texts cited in the last chapter treated meditation as a discipline of mentaltraining aimed at a twofold task: stilling the mind and generating insight. Thestill mind, calm and collected, is the foundation for insight. The still mindobserves phenomena as they arise and pass away, and from sustained observationand probing exploration arises “the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena”(adhipaññādhammavipassanā ). As wisdom gathers momentum, it penetrates moreand more deeply into the nature of things, culminating in the full andcomprehensive understanding called enlightenment (sambodhi).The Pāli word translated here as “wisdom” is paññā, the Pāli equivalent ofSanskrit prajñā, which gives its name to the voluminous prajñāpāramitāsūtras of Mahāyāna Buddhism. The idea of paññā/prajñā as the principal toolon the path to enlightenment, however, did not originate with theprajñāpāramitā literature but is already deeply embedded in the teachings ofEarly Buddhism. The Nikāyas take paññā not only as a point of doctrine but asa rich theme for imagery. Thus, Texts IX,1(1)–(2) speak of paññā respectivelyas a light and a knife. It is the supreme light because it illuminates the truenature of things and dispels the darkness of ignorance. It is a knife—a sharpbutcher’s knife—because it cuts through the tangled mass of the defilements andthereby opens the way to liberation.The Pāli word paññā is derived from the verbal root ñā (Skt: jñā), meaning“to know,” preceded by the prefix pa (Skt: pra), which merely gives the rootmeaning a more dynamic nuance. So paññā/prajñā means knowing or understanding,not as a possession, but as an action: the act of knowing, the act ofunderstanding, the act of discerning. In Pāli, the verb pajānāti, “oneunderstands,” conveys this sense more effectively than the correlative nounpaññā.1 What is meant by paññā, however, is a type of understanding superiorto that which occurs when one understands, for instance, a difficult passage inan economics textbook or the implications of a legal argument. Paññā signifiesthe understanding that arises through spiritual training, illuminates the realnature of things, and culminates in the mind’s purification and liberation. Forthis reason, despite its drawbacks, I continue to use the familiar “wisdom.”Contemporary Buddhist literature commonly conveys two ideas about paññā thathave become almost axioms in the popular understanding of Buddhism. The first isthat paññā is exclusively nonconceptual and nondiscursive, a type of cognitionthat defies all the laws of logical thought; the second, that paññā arisesspontaneously, through an act of pure intuition as sudden and instantaneous as abrilliant flash of lightning. These two ideas about paññā are closelyconnected. If paññā defies all the laws of thought, it cannot be approached byany type of conceptual activity but can arise only when the rational,discriminative, conceptual activity of the mind has been stultified. And thisstopping of conceptualization, somewhat like the demolition of a building, mustbe a rapid one, an undermining of thought not previously prepared for by anygradual maturation of understanding. Thus, in the popular understanding ofBuddhism, paññā defies rationality and easily slides off into “crazy wisdom,”an incomprehensible, mind-boggling way of relating to the world that dances atthe thin edge between super-rationality and madness.Such ideas about paññā receive no support at all from the teachings of theNikāyas, which are consistently sane, lucid, and sober. To take the two pointsin reverse order: First, far from arising spontaneously, paññā in the Nikāyasis emphatically conditioned, arisen from an underlying matrix of causes andconditions. And second, paññā is not bare intuition, but a careful,discriminative understanding that at certain stages involves precise conceptualoperations. Paññā is directed to specific domains of understanding. Thesedomains, known in the Pāli commentaries as “the soil of wisdom” (paññābhūmi),must be thoroughly investigated and mastered through conceptual understandingbefore direct, nonconceptual insight can effectively accomplish its work. Tomaster them requires analysis, discrimination, and discernment. One must be ableto abstract from the overwhelming mass of facts certain basic patternsfundamental to all experience and use these patterns as templates for closecontemplation of one’s own experience. I will have more to say about this as wego along.The conditional basis for wisdom is laid down in the three-tier structure of theBuddhist training. As we have seen, in the three divisions of the Buddhist path,moral discipline functions as the basis for concentration and concentration asthe basis for wisdom. Thus the immediate condition for the arising of wisdom isconcentration. As the Buddha often says: “Develop concentration, monks. One whois concentrated sees things as they really are.”2 To “see things as they reallyare” is the work of wisdom; the immediate basis for this correct seeing isconcentration. Since concentration depends on proper bodily and verbal conduct,moral discipline too is a condition for wisdom.Text IX,2 gives a fuller list of eight causes and conditions for obtaining “thewisdom fundamental to the spiritual life” and for bringing such wisdom tomaturity. Of particular interest is the fifth condition, which not onlyemphasizes the contribution that study of the Dhamma makes to the development ofwisdom but also prescribes a sequential program of education. First one “learnsmuch” of those “teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle,and good in the end.” Then one memorizes them; then recites them aloud; theninvestigates them with the mind; and finally “penetrates them well by view.” Thelast step can be equated with direct insight, but such insight is prepared forby the preceding steps, which provide the “information” necessary for thoroughpenetration to occur. From this, we can see that wisdom does not ariseautomatically on the basis of concentration but depends upon a clear and preciseconceptual understanding of the Dhamma induced by study, reflection, and deepcontemplation of the teachings.As a factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, wisdom is known as right view(sammādiṭṭhi). Text IX,3, a slightly abridged version of the SammādiṭṭhiSutta, the Discourse on Right View (MN 9), gives an excellent overview of the“soil of wisdom.” The Venerable Sāriputta, the Buddha’s disciple who excelledin wisdom, spoke the discourse to a group of his fellow monks. Since ancienttimes, the text has served as a primer of Buddhist studies in the monasteries ofsouthern Asia. According to the classical commentary on this sutta, right viewis twofold: conceptual right view, a clear intellectual grasp of the Dhamma; andexperiential right view, the wisdom that directly penetrates the Dhamma.Conceptual right view, called “right view in conformity with the truths”(saccānulomika-sammādiṭṭhi), is a correct understanding of the Dhammaarrived at by studying and examining the Buddha’s teachings in depth. Suchunderstanding, though conceptual rather than experiential, is by no means dryand sterile. When rooted in faith in the Buddha’s enlightenment and driven by astrong determination to realize the truth of the Dhamma, it serves as the germfrom which experiential right view evolves and thus becomes a critical step inthe growth of wisdom.Experiential right view is the realization of the truth of the Dhamma—above all,of the Four Noble Truths—in one’s own immediate experience. For this reason itis called “right view that penetrates the truths”(saccapaṭivedha-sammādiṭṭhi). To arrive at direct penetration, one beginswith correct conceptual understanding of the teaching and, by practice,transforms this understanding into direct perception. If conceptual right viewis compared to a hand—a hand that grasps the truth with the aid of concepts—thenexperiential right view might be compared to an eye. It is the eye of wisdom,the vision of the Dhamma, that sees directly into the ultimate truth, hiddenfrom us for so long by our greed, hatred, and delusion.The Discourse on Right View is intended to elucidate the principles that shouldbe comprehended by conceptual right view and penetrated by experiential rightview. Sāriputta expounds these principles under sixteen headings: the wholesomeand the unwholesome, the four nutriments of life, the Four Noble Truths, thetwelve factors of dependent origination, and the taints. It should be noted thatfrom the second section to the end of the sutta, he frames all his expositionsin accordance with the same pattern, a pattern that reveals the principle ofconditionality to be the scaffolding for the entire teaching. Whateverphenomenon he takes up, he expounds by bringing to light its individual nature,its arising, its cessation, and the way to its cessation. Since this is thepattern that underlies the Four Noble Truths, I shall call it “the four-truthpattern.” This pattern recurs throughout the Nikāyas as one of the majortemplates through which phenomena are to be viewed to arrive at true wisdom. Itsapplication makes it clear that no entity is isolated and self-enclosed but is,rather, inherently linked to other things in a complex web of dependentlyoriginated processes. The key to liberation lies in understanding the causesthat sustain this web and bringing them to an end within oneself. This is doneby practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, the way to extinguish those causes.The world-transcending right view, arrived at by penetrating any of the sixteensubjects expounded in the sutta, occurs in two main stages. The first stage isthe right view of the trainee (sekha), the disciple who has entered irreversiblyupon the path to liberation but has not yet reached its end. This stage isindicated by the words that open each section, “(one) who has perfect confidencein the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.” These words signify rightview as a vision of true principles, an insight that has initiated a radicaltransformation in the disciple but has not yet reached completion. The secondstage is the world-transcending right view of the arahant, described by theclosing words of each section. These words indicate that the disciple has usedright view to eradicate the remaining defilements and has attained completeemancipation.In section 4 we arrive at what I call “the domain of wisdom,” the areas to beexplored and penetrated by insight. Many of the texts in this section come fromthe Saṃyutta Nikāya, whose major chapters are devoted to the principaldoctrines of Early Buddhism. I include selections here on the five aggregates;the six sense bases; the elements (in different numerical sets); dependentorigination; and the Four Noble Truths. As we survey these selections we willnotice certain recurrent patterns.IX,4(1) The Five Aggregates. The five aggregates (pañcakkhandha) are the maincategories the Nikāyas use to analyze human experience. The five are: (1) form(rūpa), the physical component of experience; (2) feeling (vedanā), the“affective tone” of experience—either pleasant, painful, or neutral; (3)perception (saññā), the identification of things through their distinctivemarks and features; (4) volitional formations (saṅkhārā), a term for themultifarious mental factors involving volition, choice, and intention; and (5)consciousness (viññāṇa), cognition arisen through any of the six sensefaculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.Examination of the five aggregates, the topic of the Khandhasaṃyutta (SaṃyuttaNikāya, chapter 22), is critical to the Buddha’s teaching for at least fourreasons. First, the five aggregates are the ultimate referent of the first nobletruth, the noble truth of suffering (see the exposition of the first truth inText II,5), and since all four truths revolve around suffering, understandingthe aggregates is essential for understanding the Four Noble Truths as a whole.Second, the five aggregates are the objective domain of clinging and as suchcontribute to the causal origination of future suffering. Third, clinging to thefive aggregates must be removed to attain liberation. And fourth, the kind ofwisdom needed to remove clinging is precisely clear insight into the true natureof the aggregates. The Buddha himself declares that so long as he did notunderstand the five aggregates in terms of their individual nature, arising,cessation, and the way to their cessation, he did not claim to have attainedperfect enlightenment. The full understanding of the five aggregates is a taskhe likewise enjoins on his disciples. The five aggregates, he says, are thethings that must be fully understood; their full understanding brings thedestruction of greed, hatred, and delusion (SN 22:23).The word khandha (Skt: skandha) means, among other things, a heap or mass(rāsi). The five aggregates are so called because they each unite under onelabel a multiplicity of phenomena that share the same defining characteristic.Thus whatever form there is, “past, future, or present, internal or external,gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near,” is incorporated into theform aggregate; whatever feeling there is, “past, future, or present, internalor external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near,” isincorporated into the feeling aggregate; and so for each of the otheraggregates. Text IX,4(1)(a) enumerates in simple terms the constituents of eachaggregate and shows that each aggregate arises and ceases in correlation withits own specific condition; the Noble Eightfold Path is the way to bring eachaggregate to an end. Here we find the “four-truth pattern” applied to the fiveaggregates, an application that follows quite logically from the role that thefive aggregates play in representing the first noble truth.This sutta makes a distinction between trainees and arahants similar to thatmade by the Discourse on Right View. Trainees have directly known the fiveaggregates by way of the four-truth pattern and are practicing for their fadingaway and cessation; they have thereby “gained a foothold (gādhanti) in thisDhamma and Discipline.” Arahants too have directly known the five aggregates byway of the four-truth pattern, but they have gone further than the trainees.They have extirpated all attachment to the aggregates and are liberated bynonclinging; thus they are called “consummate ones” (kevalino) who cannot bedescribed by way of the round of rebirths.A detailed catechism on the aggregates, treating them from diverse angles, canbe found in Text IX,4(1) (b). Because the five aggregates that make up ourordinary experience are the objective domain of clinging (upādāna), they arecommonly called the five aggregates subject to clinging(pañc’upādānakkhandhā). Clinging to the five aggregates occurs in twoprincipal modes, which we might call appropriation and identification. Oneeither grasps them and takes possession of them, that is, one appropriates them;or one uses them as the basis for views about one’s self or for conceit (“I ambetter than, as good as, inferior to others”), that is, one identifies withthem. As the Nikāyas put it, we are prone to think of the aggregates thus:“This is mine, this I am, this is my self” (etaṃ mama, eso ’ham asmi, eso meattā). In this phrase, the notion “This is mine” represents the act ofappropriation, a function of craving (taṇhā). The notions “This I am” and“This is my self” represent two types of identification, the former expressingconceit (māna), the latter views (diṭṭhi).3The Five Aggregates (based on SN 22:56–57 and 22:95)015 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_015_r1.gif]Giving up craving is so difficult because craving is reinforced by views, whichrationalize our identification with the aggregates and thus equip craving with aprotective shield. The type of view that lies at the bottom of all affirmationof selfhood is called identity view (sakkāyadiṭṭhi). The suttas often mentiontwenty types of identity view, obtained by considering one’s self to stand inany of four relations to each of the five aggregates: either as identical withit, as possessing it, as containing it, or as contained within it. The“uninstructed worldling” holds some kind of identity view; “the instructed nobledisciple,” having seen with wisdom the selfless nature of the aggregates, nolonger regards the aggregates as a self or the belongings of a self. Adoptingany of these views is a cause of anxiety and distress. It is also a leash thatkeeps us bound to the round of rebirths—see above, Text I,2(3) and Text I,4(5).All the defilements ultimately stem from ignorance, which thus lies at thebottom of all suffering and bondage. Ignorance weaves a net of three delusionsaround the aggregates. These delusions are the notions that the five aggregatesare permanent, a source of true happiness, and a self. The wisdom needed tobreak the spell of these delusions is the insight into the five aggregates asimpermanent (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and nonself (anattā). This is calledthe direct knowledge of the three characteristics of existence (tilakkhaṇa).Some suttas seem to make insight into one or another of the threecharacteristics alone sufficient for reaching the goal. However, the threecharacteristics are closely interwoven, and thus the most common formula foundin the Nikāyas builds upon their internal relationship. First enunciated in theBuddha’s second discourse at Bārāṇasī—Text IX,4(1)(c)—the formula uses thecharacteristic of impermanence to reveal the characteristic of suffering, andboth together to reveal the characteristic of nonself. The suttas take thisindirect route to the characteristic of nonself because the selfless nature ofthings is so subtle that often it cannot be seen except when pointed to by theother two characteristics. When we recognize that the things we identify as ourself are impermanent and bound up with suffering, we realize that they lack theessential marks of authentic selfhood and we thereby stop identifying with them.The different expositions of the three characteristics all thus eventuallyconverge on the eradication of clinging. They do so by showing, with regard toeach aggregate, “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.” Thismakes the insight into nonself the culmination and consummation of thecontemplation of the three characteristics. While the characteristic of nonselfis usually approached through the other two characteristics, as in TextIX,4(1)(d), it is sometimes disclosed directly. An example of the directapproach to nonself is Text IX,4(1)(e), the discourse on “the lump of foam,”which uses five memorable similes to reveal the empty nature of the fiveaggregates. According to the standard formula, insight into the five aggregatesas impermanent, suffering, and nonself induces disenchantment (nibbidā),dispassion (virāga), and liberation (vimutti). One who attains liberationsubsequently wins “the knowledge and vision of liberation,” the assurance thatthe round of rebirths has indeed been stopped and nothing more remains to bedone.Another pattern that the suttas often apply to the five aggregates, and to theother groups of phenomena, is the triad of gratification, danger, and escape.Texts VI,2(1)–(3), from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, apply this triad to the world asa whole. The Saṃyutta Nikāya applies the same scheme individually to theaggregates, sense bases, and elements. The pleasure and joy each aggregate,sense base, and element offers is its gratification; its impermanence, pervasionby suffering, and nature to change is its danger; and the abandoning of desireand lust for it is the escape from it.IX,4(2) The Six Sense Bases. The Saḷāyatanasaṃyutta, the Connected Discourseson the Six Sense Bases (Saṃyutta Nikāya, chapter 35), contains over twohundred short suttas on the sense bases. The six internal and external sensebases provide a perspective on the totality of experience different from, butcomplementary to, the perspective provided by the aggregates. The six pairs ofbases are the sense faculties and their corresponding objects, which support thearising of the respective type of consciousness. Because they mediate betweenconsciousness and its objects, the internal sense bases are spoken of as the“bases for contact” (phassāyatana), “contact” (phassa) being the comingtogether of sense faculty, object, and consciousness.The Six Internal and External Sense Bases016 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_016_r1.gif]What the first five sense bases and their objects signify is obvious enough, butthe sixth pair, mind (mano) and phenomena (dhammā), presents some difficulty.If we treat the two terms as parallel to the other internal and external bases,we would understand the mind base to be the support for the arising ofmind-consciousness (manoviññāṇa) and the phenomena base to be the objectivesphere of mind-consciousness. On this interpretation, “mind” might be taken asthe passive flow of consciousness from which active conceptual consciousnessemerges, and “phenomena” as purely mental objects such as those apprehended byintrospection, imagination, and reflection. The Abhidhamma and the Pālicommentaries, however, interpret the two terms differently. They hold that themind base comprises all classes of consciousness, that is, they include withinit all six types of consciousness. They also hold that all actual entities notcomprised in the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomenabase, then, includes the other three mental aggregates—feeling, perception, andvolitional formations—as well as types of subtle material form not implicated inexperience through the physical senses. Whether this interpretation conforms tothe meaning intended in the oldest Buddhist texts is an open question.Text IX,4(2)(a) testifies that for Early Buddhism, liberation requires directknowledge and full understanding of the internal and external sense bases andall the phenomena that arise from them. This seems to establish an apparentcorrespondence between Buddhism and empirical science, but the type of knowledgesought by the two disciplines differs. Whereas the scientist seeks impersonal,“objective” information, the Buddhist practitioner seeks direct insight into thenature of these phenomena as components of lived experience.The Nikāyas suggest an interesting difference between the treatment given tothe aggregates and the sense bases. Both serve as the soil where clinging takesroot and grows, but while the aggregates are primarily the soil for views abouta self, the sense bases are primarily the soil for craving. A necessary step inthe conquest of craving is therefore restraint of the senses. Monks and nuns inparticular must be vigilant in their encounters with desirable and undesirablesense objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariablybecomes a trigger for craving: lust for pleasant objects, aversion towarddisagreeable objects (and a craving for pleasant escape routes), and a dullattachment to neutral objects.In one of his earliest discourses popularly known as “The Fire Sermon”—TextIX,4(2)(b)—the Buddha declared that “all is burning.” The “all” is just the sixsenses, their objects, the types of consciousness arisen from them, and therelated contacts and feelings. The way to liberation is to see that this “all”is burning with the fires of defilements and suffering. TheSaḷāyatanasaṃyutta repeatedly states that to dispel ignorance and generatetrue knowledge, we must contemplate all the sense bases and the feelings thatarise through them as impermanent, suffering, and nonself. This, according toText IX,4(2)(c), is the direct way to the attainment of Nibbāna. An alternativeroute, commended by Text IX,4(2)(d), is to see that the six senses areempty—empty of a self or of anything belonging to a self. Since consciousnessarises via the six sense bases, it too is devoid of self—Text IX, 4(2)(e).IX,4(3) The Elements. The elements are the subject of the Dhātusaṃyutta(Saṃyutta Nikāya, chapter 14). The word “elements” (dhātu) is applied toseveral quite disparate groups of phenomena, and thus the suttas in this chapterfall into separate clusters with little in common but their concern withentities called elements. The most important groups consist of eighteen, four,and six elements.The eighteen elements are an elaboration of the twelve sense bases. They consistof the six sense faculties, the six sense objects, and the six types of senseconsciousness. Since six types of consciousness have been extracted from themind base, the mind element that remains must be a simpler type of cognitiveevent. The Nikāyas do not specify its precise function. The Abhidhammaidentifies it with a type of consciousness that fulfills more rudimentary rolesin the process of cognition than the more discriminative mind-consciousnesselement. IX,4(3)(a) contains a simple enumeration of the eighteen elements.Contemplation of these elements helps to dispel the notion that an abidingsubject underlies the changing contents of experience. It shows how experienceconsists of different types of consciousness, each of which is conditioned,arisen in dependence on its own specific sense faculty and object. Thus toascertain the composite, diversified, conditioned nature of experience dispelsthe illusion of unity and solidity that ordinarily obscures correct cognition.The four elements are earth, water, heat, and air. These represent four“behavioral modes” of matter: solidity, fluidity, energy, and distension. Thefour are inseparably united in any unit of matter, from the smallest to thelargest and most complex. The elements are not merely properties of the externalworld, however, but also of one’s own body. Thus one must contemplate them inrelation to one’s body, as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta teaches (see Text VIII, 8§12). The three suttas combined in Text IX,4(3)(b) show that these elements canbe viewed: as impermanent and conditioned; from the triple standpoint ofgratification, danger, and escape; and by way of the four-truth pattern.The six elements include the four physical elements, the space element, and theelement of consciousness. Text IX,4(3)(c), a long excerpt from MN 140, explainsin detail how to contemplate the six elements in relation to the physical body,the external world, and conscious experience.IX,4(4) Dependent Origination. Dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda ) is socentral to the Buddha’s teaching that the Buddha said: “One who sees dependentorigination sees the Dhamma, and one who sees the Dhamma sees dependentorigination” (MN 28; I 190–91). The ulitmate purpose of the teaching ondependent origination is to reveal the conditions that sustain the round ofrebirths and thereby to show what must be done to gain release from the round.To win deliverance is a matter of unraveling the causal pattern that underliesour bondage, and this process begins with understanding the causal patternitself. It is dependent origination that defines this causal pattern.An entire chapter of the Saṃyutta Nikāya, the Nidānasaṃyutta (chapter 12),is devoted to dependent origination. The doctrine is usually expounded as asequence of twelve factors joined into a chain of eleven propositions; see TextIX,4(4)(a). A Buddha discovers this chain of conditions; after hisenlightenment, his mission is to explain it to the world. Text IX,4(4)(b)declares the sequence of conditions to be a fixed principle, a stable law, thenature of things. The series is expounded in two ways: by way of origination(called anuloma or forward order), and by way of cessation (called paṭiloma orreverse order). Sometimes the presentation proceeds from the first factor to thelast; sometimes it begins at the end and traces the chain of conditions back tothe first. Other suttas pick up the chain somewhere in the middle and workeither backward to the end or forward to the front.The Nikāyas themselves do not give any systematic explanation of dependentorigination in the way one might expect a college textbook to do. Thus, for aclear explanation, we must rely on the commentaries and expository treatisesthat have come down from the Early Buddhist schools. Despite minor differencesin details, these concur on the general meaning of this ancient formula, whichmight be briefly summarized as follows: Because of (1) ignorance (avijjā), lackof direct knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, we engage in wholesome andunwholesome activities of body, speech, and mind; these are (2) volitionalformations (saṅkhārā), in other words, kamma. Volitional formations sustainconsciousness from one life to the next and determine where it re-arises; inthis way volitional formations condition (3) consciousness (viññāṇa). Alongwith consciousness, beginning from the moment of conception, comes (4)“name-and-form” (nāmarūpa), the sentient organism with its physical form(rūpa) and its sensitive and cognitive capacities (nāma). The sentientorganism is equipped with (5) six sense bases (saḷāyatana), the five physicalsense faculties and the mind as organ of cognition. The sense bases allow (6)contact (phassa) to occur between consciousness and its objects, and contactconditions (7) feeling (vedanā). Called into play by feeling, (8) craving(taṇhā) arises, and when craving intensifies it gives rise to (9) clinging(upādāna), tight attachment to the objects of desire through sensuality andwrong views. Impelled by our attachments, we again engage in volitional actionspregnant with (10) a new existence (bhava). At death this potential for newexistence is actualized in a new life beginning with (11) birth (jāti) andending in (12) aging-and-death (jarāmaraṇa).4From the above, we can see that the commentarial interpretation treats thetwelve factors as spread out over a span of three lives, with ignorance andvolitional formations pertaining to the past, birth and aging-and-death to thefuture, and the intermediate factors to the present. The segment fromconsciousness through feeling is the resultant phase of the present, the phaseresulting from past ignorance and kamma; the segment from craving throughexistence is the karmically creative phase of the present, leading to renewedexistence in the future. But existence is distinguished into two phases: one,called kamma-existence (kammabhava), constitutes the active side of existenceand belongs to the causal phase of the present life; the other, calledrebirth-existence (upapattibhava), constitutes the passive side of existence andbelongs to the resultant phase of the future life. The twelve factors are alsodistributed into three “rounds”: the round of defilements (kilesavaṭṭa)includes ignorance, craving, and clinging; the round of action (kammavaṭṭa)includes volitional formations and kamma-existence; and all the other factorsbelong to the round of results (vipākavaṭṭa). Defilements give rise todefiled actions, actions bring forth results, and results serve as the soil formore defilements. In this way the round of rebirths revolves without discerniblebeginning.This method of dividing up the factors should not be misconstrued to mean thatthe past, present, and future factors are mutually exclusive. The distributioninto three lives is only an expository device which, for the sake of concision,has to resort to some degree of abstraction. As many suttas in theNidānasaṃyutta show, groups of factors separated in the formula are inevitablyinterwoven in their dynamic operation. Whenever there is ignorance, craving andclinging invariably accompany it; and whenever there is craving and clinging,ignorance stands behind them. The formula demonstrates how rebirth can takeplace without the presence of a substantial self that maintains its identity asit transmigrates from one life to the next. Without a self to hold the sequencetogether, what connects one life to the next is nothing other than the principleof conditionality. Conditions in one existence initiate the arising of theconditioned phenomena in the next existence; these serve as conditions for stillother phenomena, which condition still other phenomena, and so on indefinitelyinto the future. The whole process ends only when its underlyingsprings—ignorance, craving, and clinging—are extirpated by wisdom.Dependent origination is not a mere theory but a teaching that should bedirectly known by personal experience, a point clearly made by Text IX,4(4)(c).This sutta instructs the disciple to understand each factor by way of thefour-truth pattern: one should understand the factor itself, its origin, itscessation, and the way to its cessation. First one understands this pattern inrelation to one’s personal experience. Then, on this basis, one infers that allthose who correctly understood these things in the past understood them inexactly the same way; then that all those who will correctly understand thesethings in the future will understand them in exactly the same way. In this way,dependent origination acquires a timeless and universal significance.Several suttas hold up dependent origination as a “teaching by the middle”(majjhena tathāgato dhammaṃ deseti). It is a “teaching by the middle” becauseit transcends two extreme views that polarize philosophical reflection on thehuman condition. One extreme, the metaphysical thesis of eternalism(sassatavāda), asserts that the core of human identity is an indestructible andeternal self, whether individual or universal. It also asserts that the world iscreated and maintained by a permanent entity, a God or some other metaphysicalreality. The other extreme, annihilationism (ucchedavāda), holds that at deaththe person is utterly annihilated. There is no spiritual dimension to humanexistence and thus no personal survival of any sort. For the Buddha, bothextremes pose insuperable problems. Eternalism encourages an obstinate clingingto the five aggregates, which are really impermanent and devoid of a substantialself; annihilationism threatens to undermine ethics and to make suffering theproduct of chance.Dependent origination offers a radically different perspective that transcendsthe two extremes. It shows that individual existence is constituted by a currentof conditioned phenomena devoid of a metaphysical self yet continuing on frombirth to birth as long as the causes that sustain it remain effective. Dependentorigination thereby offers a cogent explanation of the problem of suffering thaton the one hand avoids the philosophical dilemmas posed by the hypothesis of apermanent self, and on the other avoids the dangers of ethical anarchy to whichannihilationism eventually leads. As long as ignorance and craving remain, theprocess of rebirth continues; kamma yields its pleasant and painful fruit, andthe great mass of suffering accumulates. When ignorance and craving aredestroyed, the inner mechanism of karmic causation is deactivated, and onereaches the end of suffering in saṃsāra. Perhaps the most elegant expositionof dependent origination as the “middle teaching” is the famous KaccānagottaSutta, included here as Text IX,4(4)(d).Though the twelve-factor formula is the most familiar version of the doctrine ofdependent origination, the Nidānasaṃyutta introduces a number of little-knownvariants that help to illuminate the standard version. One such variant, TextIX,4(4)(e), speaks about the conditions for “the continuance of consciousness”(viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā), in other words, how consciousness passes on to a newexistence. The causes are said to be the underlying tendencies, namely,ignorance and craving, and “what one intends and plans,” namely, the volitionalformations. Once consciousness becomes established, the production of a newexistence begins; thus we here proceed directly from consciousness (the usualthird factor) to existence (the usual tenth factor). Text IX,4(4)(f) says thatfrom the six internal and external sense bases (the former being the usual fifthfactor), consciousness (the third factor) arises, followed by contact, feeling,craving, and all the rest. These variants make it plain that the sequence offactors should not be regarded as a linear causal process in which eachpreceding factor gives rise to its successor through the simple exercise ofefficient causality. Far from being linear, the relationship among the factorsis always complex, involving several interwoven strands of conditionality.IX,4(5) The Four Noble Truths. As we have seen in both the “gradual path toliberation” and in the “contemplation of phenomena” section of the Discourse onthe Establishment of Mindfulness, the path to liberation culminates in therealization of the Four Noble Truths: see Text VII,4 §25 and Text VIII,8 §44.These were the truths that the Buddha discovered on the night of hisenlightenment and enunciated in his first discourse: see Text II,3(2) §42 andText II,5. The First Discourse is tucked away almost inconspicuously in theSaccasaṃyutta (Saṃyutta Nikāya, chapter 56), the Connected Discourses on theTruths, a chapter replete with many other pithy and thought-provoking suttas.To highlight the wide-ranging significance of the Four Noble Truths, theSaccasaṃyutta casts them against a universal background. According to TextIX,4(5)(a), not only the Buddha Gotama, but all the Buddhas past, present, andfuture awaken to these same four truths. These four truths, says TextIX,4(5)(b), are truths because they are “actual, unerring, not otherwise.”According to Text IX,4(5)(c), the things the Buddha teaches are as few as ahandful of leaves in the forest, and what he teaches are just these Four NobleTruths, taught precisely because they lead to enlightenment and Nibbāna.Sentient beings roam and wander in saṃsāra because they have not understoodand penetrated the Four Noble Truths—Text IX,4(5)(d). As the chain of dependentorigination shows, what lies at the base of the causal genesis of suffering isignorance (avijjā), and ignorance is unawareness of the Four Noble Truths. Thusthose who fail to understand the four truths generate volitional formations andfall down the precipice of birth, aging, and death—Text IX,4(5)(e).The antidote to ignorance is knowledge (vijjā), which accordingly is defined asknowledge of the Four Noble Truths. The first penetration of the Four NobleTruths occurs with the attainment of stream-entry, called the breakthrough tothe Dhamma (dhammābhisamaya). To make this breakthrough is by no means easy,but without doing so it is impossible to put an end to suffering—TextIX,4(5)(f). Hence the Buddha again and again urges his disciples to “make anextraordinary effort” to achieve the breakthrough to the truths.Once the disciple makes the breakthrough and sees the Four Noble Truths, morework still lies ahead, for each truth imposes a task that must be fulfilled inorder to win the final fruit. The truth of suffering, which ultimately consistsof the five aggregates, must be fully understood (pariññeyya). The truth of itsorigin, craving, must be abandoned (pahātabba). The truth of cessation,Nibbāna, must be realized (sacchikātabba ). And the truth of the way, theNoble Eightfold Path, must be developed (bhāvetabba). Developing the pathbrings to completion all four tasks, at which point one reaches the destructionof the taints. This process begins with penetration of the same Four NobleTruths, and thus Text IX,4(5)(g) says that the destruction of the taints is forthose who know and see the Four Noble Truths.IX,5 The Goal of Wisdom. The Four Noble Truths not only serve as the objectivedomain of wisdom but also define its purpose, which is enshrined in the thirdnoble truth, the cessation of suffering. The cessation of suffering is Nibbāna,and thus the goal of wisdom, the end toward which the cultivation of wisdommoves, is the attainment of Nibbāna. But what exactly is meant by Nibbāna? Thesuttas explain Nibbāna in a number of ways. Some, such as Text IX,5(1), defineNibbāna simply as the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion. Others, suchas the series comprised in Text IX,5(2), employ metaphors and images to convey amore concrete idea of the ultimate goal. Nibbāna is still the destruction oflust, hatred, and delusion, but as such it is, among other things, peaceful,deathless, sublime, wonderful, and amazing. Such descriptions indicate thatNibbāna is a state of supreme happiness, peace, and freedom to be experiencedin this present life.A few suttas, most notably a pair in the Udāna—included here as Texts IX,5(3)and IX,5(4)—suggest that Nibbāna is not simply the destruction of defilementsand an exalted feeling of psychological well-being. They speak of Nibbānaalmost as if it were a transcendent state or dimension of being. Text IX,5(3)refers to Nibbāna as a “base” (āyatana) beyond the world of common experiencewhere none of the physical elements or even the subtle formless dimensions ofexperience are present; it is a state completely quiescent, without arising,perishing, or change. Text IX,5(4) calls it the state that is “unborn, unmade,unbecome, [and] unconditioned” (ajātaṃ, akataṃ, abhūtaṃ, asaṅkhataṃ), theexistence of which makes possible deliverance from all that is born, made,come-to-be, and conditioned.How are we to correlate these two perspectives on Nibbāna found in theNikāyas, one treating it as an experiential state of inward purity and sublimebliss, the other as an unconditioned state transcending the empirical world?Commentators, both Buddhists and outsiders, have tried to connect these twoaspects of Nibbāna in different ways. Their interpretations generally reflectthe proclivity of the interpreter as much as they do the texts themselves. Theway that seems most faithful to both aspects of Nibbāna delineated in the textsis to regard the attainment of Nibbāna as a state of freedom and happinessattained by realizing, with profound wisdom, the unconditioned and transcendentelement, the state that is intrinsically tranquil and forever beyond suffering.The penetration of this element brings the destruction of defilements,culminating in complete purification of mind. Such purification is accompaniedby the experience of perfect peace and happiness in this present life. With thebreakup of the body at physical death, it brings irreversible release from thebeginningless round of rebirths.The suttas speak of two “elements of Nibbāna,” the Nibbāna element withresidue remaining (sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu) and the Nibbāna elementwithout residue remaining (anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu ). Text IX,5(5) explainsthe Nibbāna element with residue remaining to be the destruction of lust,hatred, and delusion attained by an arahant while still alive. The “residue”that remains is the composite of the five aggregates that was brought into beingby the ignorance and craving of the past life and that must continue on untilthe end of the lifespan. As to the Nibbāna element without residue remaining,the same text says only that when the arahant passes away, all that is felt, notbeing delighted in, will become cool right here. Since there is no more clingingto the five aggregates, and no more craving for fresh experience through a newset of aggregates, the occurrence of the aggregates comes to an end and cannotcontinue. The process of the five aggregates is “extinguished” (the literalmeaning of Nibbāna).5The Buddha says nothing at all, however, in terms either of existence ornonexistence, about the condition of the arahant after death. It might seemlogical to suppose that since the five aggregates that constitute experiencecompletely cease with the attainment of the Nibbāna element without residue,this element must itself be a state of complete nonexistence, a state ofnothingness. Yet no text in the Nikāyas ever states this. To the contrary, theNikāyas consistently refer to Nibbāna by terms that refer to actualities. Itis an element (dhātu), a base (āyatana), a reality (dhamma), a state (pada),and so on. However, though so designated, it is qualified in ways that indicatethis state ultimately lies beyond all familiar categories and concepts.In Text IX,5(6), the wanderer Vacchagotta asks the Buddha whether theTathāgata—here signifying one who has attained the supreme goal—is reborn(upapajjati) or not after death. The Buddha refuses to concede any of the fouralternatives. To say that the Tathāgata is reborn, is not reborn, both is andis not reborn, neither is nor is not reborn—none of these is acceptable, for allaccept the term Tathāgata as indicative of a real being, while from an internalpoint of view a Tathāgata has given up all clinging to notions of a real being.The Buddha illustrates this point with the simile of an extinguished fire. Justas a fire that has been extinguished cannot be said to have gone anywhere butmust simply be said to have “gone out,” so with the breakup of the body theTathāgata does not go anywhere but has simply “gone out.” The past participlenibbuta, used to describe a fire that has been extinguished, is related to thenoun nibbāna, which literally means “extinguishing.”6Yet, if this simile suggests a Buddhist version of the “annihilationist” view ofthe arahant’s fate after his demise, this impression would rest on amisunderstanding, on a wrong perception of the arahant as a “self” or “person”that is annihilated. Our problem in understanding the state of the Tathāgataafter death is compounded by our difficulty in understanding the state of theTathāgata even while alive. The simile of the great ocean underscores thisdifficulty. Since the Tathāgata no longer identifies with the five aggregatesthat constitute individual identity, he cannot be reckoned in terms of them,whether individually or collectively. Freed from reckoning in terms of the fiveaggregates, the Tathāgata transcends our understanding. Like the great ocean,he is “deep, immeasurable, [and] hard to fathom.”7IX. SHINING THE LIGHT OF WISDOM1. IMAGES OF WISDOM(1) WISDOM AS A LIGHT“There are, O monks, these four lights. What four? The light of the moon, thelight of the sun, the light of fire, and the light of wisdom. Of these fourlights, the light of wisdom is supreme.”(AN 4:143; II 139)(2) WISDOM AS A KNIFE11. “Sisters, suppose a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to kill a cow andcarve it up with a sharp butcher’s knife. Without damaging the inner mass offlesh and without damaging the outer hide, he would cut, sever, and carve awaythe inner tendons, sinews, and ligaments with the sharp butcher’s knife. Thenhaving cut, severed, and carved all this away, he would remove the outer hideand cover the cow again with that same hide. Would he be speaking rightly if hewere to say: ‘This cow is joined to this hide just as it was before’?”“No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because if that skilled butcher or hisapprentice were to kill a cow … and cut, sever, and carve all that away, eventhough he covers the cow again with that same hide and says: ‘This cow is joinedto this hide just as it was before,’ that cow would still be disjoined from thathide.”12. “Sisters, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning. This is themeaning: ‘The inner mass of flesh’ is a term for the six internal bases. ‘Theouter hide’ is a term for the six external bases. ‘The inner tendons, sinews,and ligaments’ is a term for delight and lust. ‘The sharp butcher’s knife’ is aterm for noble wisdom—the noble wisdom that cuts, severs, and carves away theinner defilements, fetters, and bonds.”(from MN 146: Nandakovāda Sutta; III 274–75)2. THE CONDITIONS FOR WISDOM“There are, O monks, these eight causes and conditions for obtaining the wisdomfundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and for bringingabout the increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development of the wisdomthat has already been obtained. What eight?(1) “Here, a monk lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monkin the position of a teacher, and he has set up toward him a keen sense of shameand moral dread and regards him with affection and respect. This is the firstcause and condition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…(2) “As he is living in dependence on such teachers, he approaches them fromtime to time and inquires: ‘How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning ofthis?’ Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed,clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about many perplexingpoints. This is the second cause and condition for obtaining the wisdomfundamental to the spiritual life.…(3) “Having learned the Dhamma, he dwells withdrawn by way of two kinds ofwithdrawal: withdrawal of body and withdrawal of mind. This is the third causeand condition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…(4) “He is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha,8 perfect inconduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Having undertaken thetraining rules, he trains himself in them. This is the fourth cause andcondition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…(5) “He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates whathe has learned. Such teachings that are good in the beginning, good in themiddle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and whichaffirm a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure—such teachings asthese he has learned much of, memorized, recited verbally, investigated with themind, and penetrated well by view. This is the fifth cause and condition forobtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…(6) “He is energetic; he lives with energy set upon the abandoning of everythingunwholesome and the acquiring of everything wholesome; he is steadfast andstrong in his effort, not shirking his task in regard to wholesome qualities.This is the sixth cause and condition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental tothe spiritual life.…(7) “When he is in the midst of the Saṅgha, he does not engage in rambling andpointless talk. Either he himself speaks on the Dhamma or he requests others todo so, or he does not shun noble silence. This is the seventh cause andcondition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…(8) “He dwells contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregates subject toclinging thus: ‘Such is form, such its arising, such its passing away; such isfeeling ... such is perception … such are volitional formations … such isconsciousness, such its arising, such its passing away.’ This is the eighthcause and condition for obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.…“For these eight reasons his fellow monks esteem him as one who truly knows andsees, and these qualities lead to affection, esteem, concord, and unity.“These, monks, are the eight causes and conditions for obtaining the wisdomfundamental to the spiritual life when it has not been obtained and for bringingabout the increase, maturation, and fulfillment by development of the wisdomthat has already been obtained.”(AN 8:2, abridged; IV 151–55)3. A DISCOURSE ON RIGHT VIEW1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthīin Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Venerable Sāriputtaaddressed the monks thus: “Friends, monks.”—“Friend,” they replied. TheVenerable Sāriputta said this:2. “‘One of right view, one of right view,’ is said, friends. In what way is anoble disciple one of right view, whose view is straight, who has confirmedconfidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma?”9“Indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn from the VenerableSāriputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the VenerableSāriputta would explain the meaning of this statement. Having heard it fromhim, the monks will remember it.”“Then, friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”“Yes, friend,” the monks replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:[THE WHOLESOME AND THE UNWHOLESOME]3. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root ofthe unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, in that way he isone of right view, whose view is straight, who has confirmed confidence in theDhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.4. “And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome,what is the wholesome, what is the root of the wholesome? The destruction oflife is unwholesome; taking what is not given is unwholesome; sexual misconductis unwholesome; false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is unwholesome;harsh speech is unwholesome; idle chatter is unwholesome; covetousness isunwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome. This is calledthe unwholesome.105. “And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the unwholesome;hatred is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of the unwholesome. Thisis called the root of the unwholesome.6. “And what is the wholesome? Abstention from destruction of life is wholesome;abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome; abstention from sexualmisconduct is wholesome; abstention from false speech is wholesome; abstentionfrom malicious speech is wholesome; abstention from harsh speech is wholesome;abstention from idle chatter is wholesome; uncovetousness is wholesome; non–illwill is wholesome; right view is wholesome. This is called the wholesome.7. “And what is the root of the wholesome? Nongreed is a root of the wholesome;nonhatred is a root of the wholesome; nondelusion is a root of the wholesome.This is called the root of the wholesome.8. “When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome and the root ofthe unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome,11 he entirelyabandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying tendencyto aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘Iam,’ and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and nowmakes an end of suffering.12 In that way too a noble disciple is one of rightview, whose view is straight, who has confirmed confidence in the Dhamma and hasarrived at this true Dhamma.”[NUTRIMENT]9. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.10. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin ofnutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation ofnutriment, in that way he is one of right view ... and has arrived at this trueDhamma.11. “And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is thecessation of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation of nutriment?There are four kinds of nutriment for the sustenance of beings that already havecome to be and for the support of those about to come to be. What four? Theyare: physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mentalvolition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth.13 With the arising ofcraving there is the arising of nutriment. With the cessation of craving thereis the cessation of nutriment. The way leading to the cessation of nutriment isjust this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, rightspeech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, andright concentration.12. “When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the origin ofnutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation ofnutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust ... he here andnow makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one of rightview, whose view is straight, who has confirmed confidence in the Dhamma and hasarrived at this true Dhamma.”[THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS]13. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.14. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands suffering, the origin ofsuffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation ofsuffering, in that way he is one of right view ... and has arrived at this trueDhamma.15. “And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is thecessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering?Birth is suffering; aging is suffering; illness is suffering; death issuffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair are suffering; notto get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject toclinging are suffering. This is called suffering.16. “And what is the origin of suffering? It is this craving that leads torenewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here andthere; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, cravingfor extermination. This is called the origin of suffering.17. “And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading awayand cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it,freedom from it, nonattachment.18. “And what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is just thisNoble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration. This iscalled the way leading to the cessation of suffering.19. “When a noble disciple has thus understood suffering, the origin ofsuffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation ofsuffering … he here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a nobledisciple is one of right view ... and has arrived at this true Dhamma.”[AGING AND DEATH]20. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.21. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands aging and death, the origin ofaging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the way leading to thecessation of aging and death, in that way he is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma.1422. “And what is aging and death, what is the origin of aging and death, what isthe cessation of aging and death, what is the way leading to the cessation ofaging and death? The aging of beings in the various orders of beings, their oldage, brokenness of teeth, grayness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life,weakness of faculties—this is called aging. The passing of beings out of thevarious orders of beings, their passing away, breakup, disappearance, dying,completion of time, the breakup of the aggregates, laying down of the body—thisis called death. So this aging and this death are what is called aging anddeath. With the arising of birth there is the arising of aging and death. Withthe cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging and death. The wayleading to the cessation of aging and death is just this Noble Eightfold Path;that is, right view ... right concentration.23. “When a noble disciple has thus understood aging and death, the origin ofaging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the way leading to thecessation of aging and death ... he here and now makes an end of suffering. Inthat way too a noble disciple is one of right view ... and has arrived at thistrue Dhamma.”[BIRTH]24. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.25. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands birth, the origin of birth, thecessation of birth, and the way leading to the cessation of birth, in that wayhe is one of right view ... and has arrived at this true Dhamma.26. “And what is birth, what is the origin of birth, what is the cessation ofbirth, what is the way leading to the cessation of birth? The birth of beings inthe various orders of beings, their coming to birth, precipitation [in a womb],generation, manifestation of the aggregates, obtaining the bases forcontact—this is called birth. With the arising of existence there is the arisingof birth. With the cessation of existence there is the cessation of birth. Theway leading to the cessation of birth is just this Noble Eightfold Path; thatis, right view ... right concentration.27. “When a noble disciple has thus understood birth, the origin of birth, thecessation of birth, and the way leading to the cessation of birth ... he hereand now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one ofright view … and has arrived at this true Dhamma.”[EXISTENCE]28. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view ... and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.29. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands existence, the origin ofexistence, the cessation of existence, and the way leading to the cessation ofexistence, in that way he is one of right view ... and has arrived at this trueDhamma.30. “And what is existence, what is the origin of existence, what is thecessation of existence, what is the way leading to the cessation of existence?There are these three kinds of existence: sense-sphere existence, form-sphereexistence, and formless-sphere existence.15 With the arising of clinging thereis the arising of existence. With the cessation of clinging there is thecessation of existence. The way leading to the cessation of existence is justthis Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration.31. “When a noble disciple has thus understood existence, the origin ofexistence, the cessation of existence, and the way leading to the cessation ofexistence … he here and now makes an end of suffering.

There arethese four kinds of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views,clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self.16 Withthe arising of craving there is the arising of clinging. With the cessation ofcraving there is the cessation of clinging. The way leading to the cessation ofclinging is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view... rightconcentration.35. “When a noble disciple has thus understood clinging, the origin of clinging,the cessation of clinging, and the way leading to the cessation of clinging … hehere and now makes an end of suffering.

There are thesesix classes of craving: craving for forms, craving for sounds, craving forodors, craving for flavors, craving for tactile objects, craving for mentalphenomena.17 With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving. Withthe cessation of feeling there is the cessation of craving. The way leading tothe cessation of craving is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view... right concentration.39. “When a noble disciple has thus understood craving, the origin of craving,the cessation of craving, and the way leading to the cessation of craving ... hehere and now makes an end of suffering.

Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words.

There are these six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness,ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness,mind-consciousness.20 With the arising of volitional formations there is thearising of consciousness. With the cessation of volitional formations there isthe cessation of consciousness. The way leading to the cessation ofconsciousness is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... rightconcentration.59. “When a noble disciple has thus understood consciousness, the origin ofconsciousness, the cessation of consciousness, and the way leading to thecessation of consciousness … he here and now makes an end of suffering. In thatway too a noble disciple is one of right view … and has arrived at this trueDhamma.”[VOLITIONAL FORMATIONS]60. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view … and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.61. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands volitional formations, theorigin of volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, and theway leading to the cessation of volitional formations, in that way he is one ofright view … and has arrived at this true Dhamma.62. “And what are volitional formations, what is the origin of volitionalformations, what is the cessation of volitional formations, what is the wayleading to the cessation of volitional formations? There are these three kindsof volitional formations: the bodily volitional formation, the verbal volitionalformation, the mental volitional formation.21 With the arising of ignorancethere is the arising of volitional formations. With the cessation of ignorancethere is the cessation of volitional formations. The way leading to thecessation of volitional formations is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is,right view … right concentration.63. “When a noble disciple has thus understood volitional formations, the originof volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, and the wayleading to the cessation of volitional formations … he here and now makes an endof suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view … and hasarrived at this true Dhamma.”[IGNORANCE]64. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view … and hasarrived at this true Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.65. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands ignorance, the origin ofignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way leading to the cessation ofignorance, in that way he is one of right view … and has arrived at this trueDhamma.66. “And what is ignorance, what is the origin of ignorance, what is thecessation of ignorance, what is the way leading to the cessation of ignorance?Not knowing about suffering, not knowing about the origin of suffering, notknowing about the cessation of suffering, not knowing about the way leading tothe cessation of suffering—this is called ignorance. With the arising of thetaints there is the arising of ignorance. With the cessation of the taints thereis the cessation of ignorance. The way leading to the cessation of ignorance isjust this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration.67. “When a noble disciple has thus understood ignorance, the origin ofignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way leading to the cessation ofignorance … he here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a nobledisciple is one of right view … and has arrived at this true Dhamma.”[TAINTS]68. Saying, “Good, friend,” the monks delighted and rejoiced in the VenerableSāriputta’s words. Then they asked him a further question: “But, friend, mightthere be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view, whose viewis straight, who has confirmed confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at thistrue Dhamma?”—“There might be, friends.69. “When, friends, a noble disciple understands the taints, the origin of thetaints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading to the cessation of thetaints, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who hasconfirmed confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.70. “And what are the taints, what is the origin of the taints, what is thecessation of the taints, what is the way leading to the cessation of the taints?There are these three taints: the taint of sensual desire, the taint ofexistence, and the taint of ignorance. With the arising of ignorance there isthe arising of the taints.22 With the cessation of ignorance there is thecessation of the taints. The way leading to the cessation of the taints is justthis Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech,right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and rightconcentration.71. “When a noble disciple has thus understood the taints, the origin of thetaints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading to the cessation of thetaints, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes theunderlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to theview and conceit ‘I am,’ and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledgehe here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple isone of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in theDhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.”That is what the Venerable Sāriputta said. The monks were satisfied anddelighted in the Venerable Sāriputta’s words.(MN 9: Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta; I 46–55)4. THE DOMAIN OF WISDOM(1) BY WAY OF THE FIVE AGGREGATES(A) PHASES OF THE AGGREGATESAt Sāvatthī, the Blessed One said: “Monks, there are these five aggregatessubject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, thefeeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject toclinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, theconsciousness aggregate subject to clinging.“So long as I did not directly know as they really are the five aggregatessubject to clinging in four phases,23 I did not claim to have awakened to theunsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, andBrahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas andhumans. But when I directly knew all this as it really is, then I claimed tohave awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with ...its devas and humans.“And how, monks, are there four phases? I directly knew form, its origin, itscessation, and the way leading to its cessation. I directly knew feeling ...perception ... volitional formations … consciousness, its origin, its cessation,and the way leading to its cessation.“And what, monks, is form? The four great elements and the form derived from thefour great elements: this is called form. With the arising of nutriment there isthe arising of form. With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation ofform. This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of form;that is, right view ... right concentration.“Whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known form, its origin,its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, are practicing for thepurpose of disenchantment with form, for its fading away and cessation, they arepracticing well. Those who are practicing well have gained a foothold in thisDhamma and Discipline.24“And whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known form, itsorigin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, throughdisenchantment with form, through its fading away and cessation, are liberatedby nonclinging, they are well liberated. Those who are well liberated areconsummate ones. As to those consummate ones, there is no round for theirmanifestation.25“And what, monks, is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling: feelingborn of eye-contact, feeling born of ear-contact, feeling born of nose-contact,feeling born of tongue-contact, feeling born of body-contact, feeling born ofmind-contact. This is called feeling. With the arising of contact there is thearising of feeling. With the cessation of contact there is the cessation offeeling. This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation offeeling; that is, right view ... right concentration.“Whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known feeling, its origin,its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, are practicing for thepurpose of disenchantment with feeling, for its fading away and cessation, theyare practicing well. Those who are practicing well have gained a foothold inthis Dhamma and Discipline.“And whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known feeling ... andthe way leading to its cessation … As to those consummate ones, there is noround for their manifestation.“And what, monks, is perception? There are these six classes of perception:perception of forms, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception oftastes, perception of tactile objects, perception of mental phenomena. This iscalled perception. With the arising of contact there is the arising ofperception. With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of perception.This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of perception;that is, right view ... right concentration.“Whatever ascetics and brahmins … As to those consummate ones, there is no roundfor their manifestation.“And what, monks, are volitional formations? There are these six classes ofvolition:26 volition regarding forms, volition regarding sounds, volitionregarding odors, volition regarding tastes, volition regarding tactile objects,volition regarding mental phenomena. These are called volitional formations.With the arising of contact there is the arising of volitional formations. Withthe cessation of contact there is the cessation of volitional formations. ThisNoble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitionalformations; that is, right view … right concentration.“Whatever ascetics and brahmins … As to those consummate ones, there is no roundfor their manifestation.“And what, monks, is consciousness? There are these six classes ofconsciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness,tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. This is calledconsciousness. With the arising of name-and-form there is the arising ofconsciousness.27 With the cessation of name-and-form there is the cessation ofconsciousness. This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation ofconsciousness; that is, right view ... right concentration.“Whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known consciousness, itsorigin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, are practicing forthe purpose of disenchantment with consciousness, for its fading away andcessation, they are practicing well. Those who are practicing well have gained afoothold in this Dhamma and Discipline.“And whatever ascetics and brahmins, having thus directly known consciousness,its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, throughdisenchantment with consciousness, through its fading away and cessation, areliberated by nonclinging, they are well liberated. Those who are well liberatedare consummate ones. As to those consummate ones, there is no round for theirmanifestation.”(SN 22:56; III 58–61)(B) A CATECHISM ON THE AGGREGATESOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park,in the Mansion of Migāra’s Mother, together with a great Saṅgha of monks. Nowon that occasion—the uposatha day of the fifteenth, a full-moon night—theBlessed One was sitting out in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.Then a certain monk rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over oneshoulder, raised his joined hands in reverential salutation toward the BlessedOne, and said to him: “Venerable sir, I would ask the Blessed One about acertain point, if the Blessed One would grant me the favor of answering myquestion.”“Well then, monk, sit down in your own seat and ask whatever you wish.”“Yes, venerable sir,” that monk replied. Then he sat down in his own seat andsaid to the Blessed One:“Aren’t these the five aggregates subject to clinging, venerable sir: that is,the form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject toclinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitionalformations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject toclinging?”“They are, monk.”Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” that monk delighted and rejoiced in the BlessedOne’s statement. Then he asked the Blessed One a further question:“But, venerable sir, in what are these five aggregates subject to clingingrooted?”“These five aggregates subject to clinging, monk, are rooted in desire.”28“Venerable sir, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates subject toclinging, or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subject toclinging?”“Monk, that clinging is neither the same as the five aggregates subject toclinging, nor is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates subjectto clinging. But rather, the desire and lust for them, that is the clingingthere.”29Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” that monk ... asked the Blessed One a furtherquestion:“But, venerable sir, can there be diversity in the desire and lust for the fiveaggregates subject to clinging?”“There can be, monk,” the Blessed One said. “Here, monk, it occurs to someone:‘May I be of such form in the future! May I be of such feeling in the future!May I be of such perception in the future! May I be of such volitionalformations in the future! May I be of such consciousness in the future!’ Thus,monk, there can be diversity in the desire and lust for the five aggregatessubject to clinging.”Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” that monk ... asked the Blessed One a furtherquestion:“In what way, venerable sir, does the designation ‘aggregates’ apply to theaggregates?”“Whatever kind of form there is, monk, whether past, future, or present,internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: thisis called the form aggregate. Whatever kind of feeling there is, whether past,future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior,far or near: this is called the feeling aggregate. Whatever kind of perceptionthere is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross orsubtle, inferior or superior, far or near: this is called the perceptionaggregate. Whatever kind of volitional formations there are, whether past,future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior,far or near: this is called the volitional formations aggregate. Whatever kindof consciousness there is, whether past, future, or present, internal orexternal, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: this is called theconsciousness aggregate. It is in this way, monk, that the designation‘aggregates’ applies to the aggregates.”Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” that monk ... asked the Blessed One a furtherquestion:“What is the cause and condition, venerable sir, for the manifestation of theform aggregate? What is the cause and condition for the manifestation of thefeeling aggregate?… for the manifestation of the perception aggregate?… for themanifestation of the volitional formations aggregate?… for the manifestation ofthe consciousness aggregate?”“The four great elements, monk, are the cause and condition for themanifestation of the form aggregate. Contact is the cause and condition for themanifestation of the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, and thevolitional formations aggregate. Name-and-form is the cause and condition forthe manifestation of the consciousness aggregate.”“Venerable sir, how does identity view come to be?”“Here, monk, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones andis unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superiorpersons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form asself, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. Heregards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations as self... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousnessas in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view comes to be.”“But, venerable sir, how does identity view not come to be?”“Here, monk, the instructed noble disciple, who is a seer of the noble ones andis skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who is a seer of superior personsand is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as self, orself as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He does notregard feeling as self ... perception as self … volitional formations as self... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousnessas in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view does not cometo be.”“What, venerable sir, is the gratification, the danger, and the escape in thecase of the five aggregates?”“The pleasure and joy, monk, that arise in dependence on form: this is thegratification in form. That form is impermanent, suffering, and subject tochange: this is the danger in form. The removal and abandonment of desire andlust for form: this is the escape from form. The pleasure and joy that arise independence on feeling ... in dependence on perception ... in dependence onvolitional formations ... in dependence on consciousness: this is thegratification in consciousness. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering,and subject to change: this is the danger in consciousness. The removal andabandonment of desire and lust for consciousness: this is the escape fromconsciousness.”Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” that monk delighted and rejoiced in the BlessedOne’s statement. Then he asked the Blessed One a further question:“Venerable sir, how should one know and see so that, in regard to this body withconsciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, andthe underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within?”30“Any kind of form whatsoever, monk, whether past, future, or present, internalor external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—one sees allform as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not,this is not my self.’“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever ... Any kindof volitional formations whatsoever . . . Any kind of consciousness whatsoever,whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,inferior or superior, far or near—one sees all consciousness as it really iswith correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself.’“When one knows and sees thus, monk, then in regard to this body withconsciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, andthe underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within.”(from SN 22: 82, abridged; 100–103 = MN 109, abridged; III 15–19)(C) THE CHARACTERISTIC OF NONSELFThus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasīin the Deer Park at Isipatana.31 There the Blessed One addressed the monks ofthe group of five thus: “Monks!”“Venerable sir!” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“Monks, form is nonself. For if, monks, form were self, this form would not leadto affliction, and it would be possible to determine form: ‘Let my form be thus;let my form not be thus.’ But because form is nonself, form leads to affliction,and it is not possible to determine form: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form notbe thus.’32“Feeling is nonself…. Perception is nonself…. Volitional formations arenonself…. Consciousness is nonself. For if, monks, consciousness were self, thisconsciousness would not lead to affliction, and it would be possible todetermine consciousness: ‘Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness notbe thus.’ But because consciousness is nonself, consciousness leads toaffliction, and it is not possible to determine consciousness: ‘Let myconsciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be thus.’“What do you think, monks, is form permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent,venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—“Suffering,venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit tobe regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”—“No, venerablesir.”“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?… Is perception permanent or impermanent?…Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent? … Is consciousness permanentor impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent sufferingor happiness?”—“Suffering, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent, suffering,and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this ismy self’?”—“No, venerable sir.”“Therefore, monks, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, orpresent, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far ornear, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This isnot mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever ... Any kindof volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever,whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it reallyis with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself.’“Seeing thus, monks, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted withform, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted withvolitional formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Becoming disenchanted,he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it isliberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands:‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done hasbeen done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”That is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those monks delighted in the BlessedOne’s statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of themonks of the group of five were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.(SN 22:59; III 66–68)(D) IMPERMANENT, SUFFERING, NONSELF“Monks, form is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering. What is sufferingis nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdomthus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees thisthus as it really is with correct wisdom, the mind becomes dispassionate and isliberated from the taints by nonclinging.“Feeling is impermanent…. Perception is impermanent…. Volitional formations areimpermanent…. Consciousness is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering.What is suffering is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really iswith correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself.’ When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, the mindbecomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.“If, monks, a monk’s mind has become dispassionate toward the form element, itis liberated from the taints by nonclinging. If his mind has becomedispassionate toward the feeling element ... toward the perception element ...toward the volitional formations element ... toward the consciousness element,it is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.“By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by beingcontent, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what hadto be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”(SN 22:45; III 44–45)(E) A LUMP OF FOAMOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ayojjhā on the bank of theriver Ganges. There the Blessed One addressed the monks thus:“Monks, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foam.A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it,and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substancecould there be in a lump of foam? So too, monks, whatever kind of form there is,whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefullyinvestigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.For what substance could there be in form?33“Suppose, monks, that in the autumn, when it is raining and big rain drops arefalling, a water bubble arises and bursts on the surface of the water. A manwith good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, andit would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substancecould there be in a water bubble? So too, monks, whatever kind of feeling thereis, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefullyinvestigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.For what substance could there be in feeling?34“Suppose, monks, that in the last month of the hot season, at high noon, ashimmering mirage appears. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it,and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow,insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a mirage? So too, monks,whatever kind of perception there is, whether past, future, or present, internalor external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspectsit, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to bevoid, hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception?35“Suppose, monks, that a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering insearch of heartwood, would take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There he wouldsee the trunk of a large banana tree, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core.He would cut it down at the root, cut off the crown, and unroll the coil. As heunrolls the coil, he would not find even softwood, let alone heartwood. A manwith good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, andit would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substancecould there be in the trunk of a banana tree? So too, monks, whatever kind ofvolitional formations there are, whether past, future, or present, internal orexternal, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspectsthem, ponders them, and carefully investigates them. As he investigates them,they appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substance couldthere be in volitional formations?36 “Suppose, monks, that a magician or amagician’s apprentice would display a magical illusion at a crossroads. A manwith good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, andit would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substancecould there be in a magical illusion? So too, monks, whatever kind ofconsciousness there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external,gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, pondersit, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void,hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in consciousness?37“Seeing thus, monks, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted withform, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted withvolitional formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Becoming disenchanted,he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it isliberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands:‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done hasbeen done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”(SN 22:95; III 140–42)(2) BY WAY OF THE SIX SENSE BASES(A) FULL UNDERSTANDING“Monks, without directly knowing and fully understanding the all, withoutdeveloping dispassion toward it and abandoning it, one is incapable ofdestroying suffering.“And what, monks, is that all? Without directly knowing and fully understandingthe eye, without developing dispassion toward it and abandoning it, one isincapable of destroying suffering. Without directly knowing and fullyunderstanding forms … eye-consciousness ... eye-contact ... and whatever feelingarises with eye-contact as condition … without developing dispassion toward itand abandoning it, one is incapable of destroying suffering.“Without directly knowing and fully understanding the ear ... the mind ... andwhatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … without developingdispassion toward it and abandoning it, one is incapable of destroyingsuffering.“This, monks, is the all. Without directly knowing and fully understanding thisall ... one is incapable of destroying suffering.“Monks, by directly knowing and fully understanding the all, by developingdispassion toward it and abandoning it, one is capable of destroying suffering.“And what, monks, is that all? By directly knowing and fully understanding theeye ... the mind ... and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition… by developing dispassion toward it and abandoning it, one is capable ofdestroying suffering.“This, monks, is the all by directly knowing and fully understanding which ...one is capable of destroying suffering.”(SN 35:26; IV 17–18)(B) BURNINGOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayā, at Gayā’s Head, togetherwith a thousand monks. There the Blessed One addressed the monks thus:38“Monks, all is burning. And what, monks, is the all that is burning? The eye isburning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact isburning, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whetherpleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is burning. Burningwith what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fireof delusion; burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair, I say.“The ear is burning ... The mind is burning ... and whatever feeling arises withmind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful orneither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burningwith the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion;burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection,and despair, I say.“Seeing thus, monks, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with theeye, with forms, with eye-consciousness, with eye-contact, with whatever feelingarises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful orneither-painful-nor-pleasant; becomes disenchanted with the ear ... with themind ... with whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition…. Becomingdisenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind] isliberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ Heunderstands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had tobe done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those monks delighted in the BlessedOne’s statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of thethousand monks were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.(SN 35:28; IV 19–20)(C) SUITABLE FOR ATTAINING NIBBĀNA“Monks, I will teach you the way that is suitable for attaining Nibbāna.Listen….“And what, monks, is the way that is suitable for attaining Nibbāna? Here, amonk sees the eye as impermanent, he sees forms as impermanent, he seeseye-consciousness as impermanent, he sees eye-contact as impermanent, he sees asimpermanent whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition, whetherpleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant.“He sees the ear as impermanent … He sees the mind as impermanent, he seesmental phenomena as impermanent, he sees mind-consciousness as impermanent, hesees mind-contact as impermanent, he sees as impermanent whatever feeling ariseswith mind-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful orneither-painful-nor-pleasant. This, monks, is the way that is suitable forattaining Nibbāna.”“He sees the eye as suffering ... he sees as suffering whatever feeling ariseswith mind-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful orneither-painful-nor-pleasant. This, monks, is the way that is suitable forattaining Nibbāna.“He sees the eye as nonself … he sees as nonself whatever feeling arises withmind-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful orneither-painful-nor-pleasant. This, monks, is the way that is suitable forattaining Nibbāna.”(SN 35:147–49, combined; IV 133–35)(D) EMPTY IS THE WORLDThen the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Empty is the world, empty is the world.’ In whatway, venerable sir, is it said, ‘Empty is the world’?”“It is, Ānanda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that itis said, ‘Empty is the world.’ And what is empty of self and of what belongs toself? The eye, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Forms areempty of self and of what belongs to self. Eye-consciousness is empty of selfand of what belongs to self. Eye-contact is empty of self and of what belongs toself…. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasantor painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is empty of self and of whatbelongs to self.“It is, Ānanda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that itis said, ‘Empty is the world.’”(SN 35:85; IV 54)(E) CONSCIOUSNESS TOO IS NONSELFThe Venerable Udāyī asked the Venerable Ānanda: “Friend Ānanda, in many ways[the nature of] this body has been declared, disclosed, and revealed by theBlessed One thus: ‘For such a reason this body is nonself.’ Is it possible toexplain [the nature of] this consciousness in a similar way—to teach, proclaim,establish, disclose, analyze, and elucidate it thus: ‘For such a reason thisconsciousness is nonself’?”“It is possible, friend Udāyī. Doesn’t eye-consciousness arise in dependenceon the eye and forms?”“Yes, friend.”“If the cause and condition for the arising of eye-consciousness would ceasecompletely and totally without remainder, could eye-consciousness be discerned?”“No, friend.”“In this way, friend, this has been declared, disclosed, and revealed by theBlessed One thus: ‘For such a reason this consciousness is nonself.’“Doesn’t ear-consciousness arise in dependence on the ear and sounds?… Doesn’tmind-consciousness arise in dependence on the mind and mental phenomena?”“Yes, friend.”“If the cause and condition for the arising of mind-consciousness would ceasecompletely and totally without remainder, could mind-consciousness bediscerned?”“No, friend.”“In this way too, friend, this has been declared, disclosed, and revealed by theBlessed One thus: ‘For such a reason this consciousness is nonself.’“Suppose, friend, a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering insearch of heartwood, would take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There he wouldsee the trunk of a large banana tree, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core.He would cut it down at the root, cut off the crown, and unroll the coil. As heunrolls the coil, he would not find even softwood, let alone heartwood.“So too, a monk does not recognize either a self or anything belonging to a selfin these six bases for contact. Since he does not recognize anything thus, hedoes not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Beingunagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth,the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there isno more coming back to any state of being.’”(SN 35:234; IV 166–68)(3) BY WAY OF THE ELEMENTS(A) THE EIGHTEEN ELEMENTS“Monks, I will teach you the diversity of elements. The eye element, formelement, eye-consciousness element; the ear element, sound element,ear-consciousness element; the nose element, odor element, nose-consciousnesselement; the tongue element, taste element, tongue-consciousness element; thebody element, tactile-object element, body-consciousness element; the mindelement, mental-phenomena element, mind-consciousness element. This, monks, iscalled the diversity of elements.”(SN 14:1; II 140)(B) THE FOUR ELEMENTS“Monks, there are these four elements. What four? The earth element, the waterelement, the heat element, the air element.“Those ascetics or brahmins, monks, who do not understand as they really are thegratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these four elements:these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins amongbrahmins, and these venerable ones do not, by realizing it for themselves withdirect knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism orthe goal of brahminhood.“But, monks, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are thegratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these four elements:these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, andthese venerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, inthis very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal ofbrahminhood.”“Those ascetics or brahmins, monks, who do not understand as they really are theorigin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape inthe case of these four elements: these I do not consider to be ascetics amongascetics….“But, monks, those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things: these Iconsider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, and thesevenerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in thisvery life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal ofbrahminhood.”“Monks, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand the earth element, itsorigin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who do notunderstand the water element ... the heat element ... the air element, itsorigin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation: these I do notconsider to be ascetics among ascetics….“But, monks, those ascetics and brahmins who understand these things: these Iconsider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, and thesevenerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in thisvery life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal ofbrahminhood.”(SN 14:37–39, combined; II 175–77)(C) THE SIX ELEMENTS13. “How, monk, does one not neglect wisdom?39 There are these six elements: theearth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element, the spaceelement, and the consciousness element.14. “What, monk, is the earth element? The earth element may be either internalor external. What is the internal earth element? Whatever internally, belongingto oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung-to, that is, head-hairs, body-hairs,nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver,diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, or whateverelse internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung-to: thisis called the internal earth element. Now both the internal earth element andthe external earth element are simply earth element. And that should be seen asit really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this isnot my self.’ When one sees it thus as it really is with correct wisdom, onebecomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionatetoward the earth element.15. “What, monk, is the water element? The water element may be either internalor external. What is the internal water element? Whatever internally, belongingto oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to, that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood,sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whateverelse internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to: this iscalled the internal water element. Now both the internal water element and theexternal water element are simply water element. And that should be seen as itreally is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this isnot my self.’ When one sees it thus as it really is with correct wisdom, onebecomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind dispassionatetoward the water element.16. “What, monk, is the fire element? The fire element may be either internal orexternal. What is the internal fire element? Whatever internally, belonging tooneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to, that is, that by which one is warmed,ages, and is consumed, and that by which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, andtasted gets completely digested, or whatever else internally, belonging tooneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element.Now both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply fireelement. And that should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘Thisis not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees it thus as itreally is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire elementand makes the mind dispassionate toward the fire element.17. “What, monk, is the air element? The air element may be either internal orexternal. What is the internal air element? Whatever internally, belonging tooneself, is air, airy, and clung-to, that is, up-going winds, down-going winds,winds in the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through the limbs,in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, isair, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now both theinternal air element and the external air element are simply air element. Andthat should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine,this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees it thus as it really is withcorrect wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the minddispassionate toward the air element.18. “What, monk, is the space element? The space element may be either internalor external. What is the internal space element? Whatever internally, belongingto oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to, that is, the holes of the ears, thenostrils, the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is eaten,drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects, and wherebyit is excreted from below, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, isspace, spatial, and clung-to: this is called the internal space element. Nowboth the internal space element and the external space element are simply spaceelement. And that should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘Thisis not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees it thus as itreally is with correct wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the space elementand makes the mind dispassionate toward the space element.19. “Then there remains only consciousness, purified and bright.40 What does onecognize with that consciousness? One cognizes: ‘[This is] pleasant’; onecognizes: ‘[This is] painful’; one cognizes: ‘[This is]neither-painful-nor-pleasant.’ In dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasantthere arises a pleasant feeling.41 When one feels a pleasant feeling, oneunderstands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’ One understands: ‘With the cessationof that same contact to be felt as pleasant, its corresponding feeling—thepleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt aspleasant—ceases and subsides.’ In dependence on a contact to be felt as painfulthere arises a painful feeling. When one feels a painful feeling, oneunderstands: ‘I feel a painful feeling. ’ One understands: ‘With the cessationof that same contact to be felt as painful, its corresponding feeling—thepainful feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt aspainful—ceases and subsides. ’ In dependence on a contact to be felt asneither-painful-nor-pleasant there arises a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling. When one feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, one understands:‘I feel a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’ One understands: ‘With thecessation of that same contact to be felt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, itscorresponding feeling—the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that arose independence on that contact to be felt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant—ceases andsubsides.’ Monk, just as from the contact and friction of two fire-sticks heatis generated and fire is produced, and with the separation and disjunction ofthese two fire-sticks the corresponding heat ceases and subsides; so too, independence on a contact to be felt as pleasant … to be felt as painful … to befelt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant there arises a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling. … One understands: ‘With the cessation of that same contact to be feltas neither-painful-nor-pleasant, its corresponding feeling ... ceases andsubsides.’”(from MN 140: Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta; III 240–43)(4) BY WAY OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION(A) WHAT IS DEPENDENT ORIGINATION?“Monks, I will teach you dependent origination. Listen to that and attendclosely, I will speak.”—“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. The BlessedOne said this:“And what, monks, is dependent origination? With ignorance as condition,volitional formations [come to be]; with volitional formations as condition,consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; withname-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases ascondition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling ascondition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging ascondition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth ascondition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despaircome to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, monks, iscalled dependent origination.“But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comescessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations,cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation ofname-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sensebases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with thecessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling,cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; withthe cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation ofexistence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death,sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair cease. Such is the cessationof this whole mass of suffering.”(SN 12:1; II 1–2)(B) THE STABLENESS OF THE DHAMMA“Monks, I will teach you dependent origination and dependently arisen phenomena.Listen and attend closely, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“And what, monks, is dependent origination? ‘With birth as condition,aging-and-death [comes to be]’: whether there is an arising of Tathāgatas or noarising of Tathāgatas, that element still persists, the stableness of theDhamma, the fixed course of the Dhamma, specific conditionality.42 A Tathāgataawakens to this and breaks through to it. Having done so, he explains it,teaches it, proclaims it, establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it, elucidatesit. And he says: ‘See! With birth as condition, monks, aging-and-death arises.’“‘With existence as condition, birth’ … ‘With clinging as condition, existence’… ‘With craving as condition, clinging’ … ‘With feeling as condition, craving’ …‘With contact as condition, feeling’ … ‘With the six sense bases as condition,contact’ ... ‘With name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases’ … ‘Withconsciousness as condition, name-and-form’ ... ‘With volitional formations ascondition, consciousness’ ... ‘With ignorance as condition, volitionalformations’: whether there is an arising of Tathāgatas or no arising ofTathāgatas, that element still persists, the stableness of the Dhamma, thefixed course of the Dhamma, specific conditionality. A Tathāgata awakens tothis and breaks through to it. Having done so, he explains it, teaches it,proclaims it, establishes it, discloses it, analyzes it, elucidates it. And hesays: ‘See! With ignorance as condition, monks, volitional formations arise.’“Thus, monks, the actuality, the inerrancy, the invariability, the specificconditionality in this: this is called dependent origination. 43 “And what,monks, are the dependently arisen phenomena? Aging-and-death, monks, isimpermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing,fading away, and cessation. Birth is impermanent … Existence is impermanent …Clinging is impermanent . . . Craving is impermanent ... Feeling is impermanent... Contact is impermanent ... The six sense bases are impermanent ...Name-and-form is impermanent ... Consciousness is impermanent ... Volitionalformations are impermanent … Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependentlyarisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and cessation. These,monks, are called the dependently arisen phenomena.“When, monks, a noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom as it reallyis this dependent origination and these dependently arisen phenomena, it isimpossible that he will run back into the past, thinking: ‘Did I exist in thepast? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in thepast? Having been what, what did I become in the past?’ Or that he will runforward into the future, thinking: ‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not existin the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? Havingbeen what, what will I become in the future?’ Or that he will now be inwardlyconfused about the present thus: ‘Do I exist? Do I not exist? What am I? How amI? This being—where has it come from, and where will it go?’“For what reason? Because the noble disciple has clearly seen with correctwisdom as it really is this dependent origination and these dependently arisenphenomena.”(SN 12:20; II 25–27)(C) FORTY-FOUR CASES OF KNOWLEDGE“Monks, I will teach you forty-four cases of knowledge. Listen to that andattend closely, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“Monks, what are the forty-four cases of knowledge? Knowledge ofaging-and-death, knowledge of its origin, knowledge of its cessation, knowledgeof the way leading to its cessation. Knowledge of birth … Knowledge of existence… Knowledge of clinging … Knowledge of craving . . . Knowledge of feeling ...Knowledge of contact ... Knowledge of the six sense bases … Knowledge ofname-and-form … Knowledge of consciousness … Knowledge of volitional formations,knowledge of their origin, knowledge of their cessation, knowledge of the wayleading to their cessation. These, monks, are the forty-four cases of knowledge.“And what, monks, is aging-and-death?… [definition as in Text IX,3 §22] … Thusthis aging and this death are together called aging-and-death. With the arisingof birth there is the arising of aging-and-death. With the cessation of birththere is the cessation of aging-and-death. This Noble Eightfold Path is the wayleading to the cessation of aging-and-death; that is, right view … rightconcentration.“When, monks, a noble disciple thus understands aging-and-death, its origin, itscessation, and the way leading to its cessation, this is his knowledge of theprinciple.44 By means of this principle that is seen, understood, immediatelyattained, fathomed, he applies the method to the past and the future thus:‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew aging-and-death, itsorigin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, all these directlyknew it in the very same way that I do now. Whatever ascetics and brahmins inthe future will directly know aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, andthe way leading to its cessation, all these will directly know it in the verysame way that I do now.’ This is his knowledge of entailment.45“When, monks, a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds ofknowledge—knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment—he is thencalled a noble disciple who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, whohas arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses atrainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the stream ofthe Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely beforethe door to the Deathless.“And what, monks, is birth?… What are the volitional formations?… [definitionsas in Text IX,3] … This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessationof volitional formations; that is, right view ... right concentration.“When, monks, a noble disciple thus understands volitional formations, theirorigin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation, this is hisknowledge of the principle. By means of this principle that is seen, understood,immediately attained, fathomed, he applies the method to the past and to thefuture…. This is his knowledge of entailment.“When, monks, a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds ofknowledge—knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment—he is thencalled a noble disciple who is accomplished in view ... one who stands squarelybefore the door to the Deathless.”(SN 12:33; II 56–59)(D) A TEACHING BY THE MIDDLEAt Sāvatthī, the Venerable Kaccānagotta approached the Blessed One, paidhomage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, it issaid, ‘right view, right view.’ In what way, venerable sir, is there rightview?”“This world, Kaccāna, for the most part depends upon a duality—upon the idea ofexistence and the idea of nonexistence.46 But for one who sees the origin of theworld as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no idea of nonexistence inregard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as itreally is with correct wisdom, there is no idea of existence in regard to theworld.47“This world, Kaccāna, is for the most part shackled by engagement, clinging,and adherence. But this one [with right view] does not become engaged and clingthrough that engagement and clinging, mental standpoint, adherence, underlyingtendency; he does not take a stand about ‘my self.’ He has no perplexity ordoubt that what arises is only suffering arising, what ceases is only sufferingceasing.48 His knowledge about this is independent of others. It is in this way,Kaccāna, that there is right view.“‘All exists’: Kaccāna, this is one extreme. ‘All does not exist’: this is thesecond extreme. Without veering toward either of these extremes, the Tathāgatateaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitionalformations [come to be]; with volitional formations as condition,consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with theremainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation ofvolitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation ofconsciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’”(SN 12:15; II 16–17)(E) THE CONTINUANCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS“Monks, what one intends and what one plans and whatever one has a tendencytoward: this becomes a basis for the continuance of consciousness. When there isa basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. Whenconsciousness is established and has come to growth, there is the production offuture renewed existence. When there is the production of future renewedexistence, future birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection,and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.49“If, monks, one does not intend and does not plan but still has a tendencytoward something, this becomes a basis for the continuance of consciousness.When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing ofconsciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. 50“But, monks, when one does not intend and does not plan and does not have atendency toward anything, no basis exists for the continuance of consciousness.When there is no basis, there is no support for the establishing ofconsciousness. When consciousness is unestablished and does not come to growth,there is no production of future renewed existence. When there is no productionof future renewed existence, future birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass ofsuffering.”51(SN 12:38; II 65–66)(F) THE ORIGIN AND PASSING OF THE WORLD“Monks, I will teach you the origin and the passing away of the world. Listenand attend closely, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” the monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“And what, monks, is the origin of the world? In dependence on the eye andforms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. Withcontact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving;with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; withexistence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow,lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair come to be. This, monks, is the originof the world.“In dependence on the ear and sounds ... In dependence on the nose and odors ...In dependence on the tongue and tastes ... In dependence on the body and tactileobjects ... In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousnessarises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling[comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition,clinging … existence … birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow,lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair come to be. This, monks, is the originof the world.“And what, monks, is the passing away of the world? In dependence on the eye andforms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. Withcontact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving.But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comescessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence;with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation ofbirth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair cease.Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This, monks, is thepassing away of the world.“In dependence on the ear and sounds ... In dependence on the mind and mentalphenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. Withcontact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving.But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comescessation of clinging ... cessation of existence ... cessation of birth; withthe cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection,and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This,monks, is the passing away of the world.”(SN 12:44; II 73–74)(5) BY WAY OF THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS(A) THE TRUTHS OF ALL BUDDHAS“Monks, whatever Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas in the past fully awakened tothings as they really are, all fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as theyreally are. Whatever Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas in the future will fullyawaken to things as they really are, all will fully awaken to the Four NobleTruths as they really are. Whatever Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas at presenthave fully awakened to things as they really are, all have fully awakened to theFour Noble Truths as they really are.“What four? The noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin ofsuffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, the noble truth of theway leading to the cessation of suffering. Whatever Perfectly EnlightenedBuddhas fully awakened … will fully awaken … have fully awakened to things asthey really are, all have fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as theyreally are.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’ An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the origin ofsuffering.’ An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the cessation ofsuffering.’ An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:24; V 433–34)(B) THESE FOUR TRUTHS ARE ACTUAL“Monks, these four things are actual, unerring, invariable.52 What four?“‘This is suffering’: this, monks, is actual, unerring, invariable. ‘This is theorigin of suffering’: this is actual, unerring, invariable. ‘This is thecessation of suffering’: this is actual, unerring, invariable. ‘This is the wayleading to the cessation of suffering’: this is actual, unerring, invariable.“These four things, monks, are actual, unerring, invariable.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:20; V 430–31)(C) A HANDFUL OF LEAVESOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in a siṃsapā grove.Then the Blessed One took up a few siṃsapā leaves in his hand and addressedthe monks thus: “What do you think, monks, which is more numerous: these fewleaves that I have taken up in my hand or those in the grove overhead?”“Venerable sir, the leaves that the Blessed One has taken up in his hand arefew, but those in the grove overhead are numerous.”“So too, monks, the things I have directly known but have not taught you arenumerous, while the things I have taught you are few. And why, monks, have I nottaught those many things? Because they are without benefit, irrelevant to thefundamentals of the spiritual life, and do not lead to disenchantment, todispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, toNibbāna. Therefore I have not taught them.“And what, monks, have I taught? I have taught: ‘This is suffering’; I havetaught: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; I have taught: ‘This is the cessationof suffering’; I have taught: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation ofsuffering.’ And why, monks, have I taught this? Because this is beneficial,relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, and leads to disenchantment,to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, toNibbāna. Therefore I have taught this.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:31; V 437–38)(D) BECAUSE OF NOT UNDERSTANDINGOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Koṭigāma.There the Blessed One addressed the monks thus: “Monks, it is because of notunderstanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I haveroamed and wandered through this long course of saṃsāra. What four?“It is, monks, because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truthof suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course ofsaṃsāra. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating the nobletruth of the origin of suffering … the noble truth of the cessation of suffering… the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering that you andI have roamed and wandered through this long course of saṃsāra.“That noble truth of suffering, monks, has been understood and penetrated. Thatnoble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated. Thatnoble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated.That noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has beenunderstood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduitto existence53 has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence.”(SN 56:21; V 431–32)(E) THE PRECIPICEOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak.Then the Blessed One addressed the monks thus: “Come, monks, let us go toInspiration Peak for the day’s abiding.”“Yes, venerable sir,” those monks replied. Then the Blessed One, together with anumber of monks, went to Inspiration Peak. A certain monk saw the steepprecipice off Inspiration Peak and said to the Blessed One: “That precipice isindeed steep, venerable sir; that precipice is extremely frightful. But isthere, venerable sir, a precipice steeper and more frightful than that one?”“There is, monk.”“But what precipice, venerable sir, is steeper and more frightful than thatone?”“Those ascetics and brahmins, monk, who do not understand as it really is: ‘Thisis suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is the cessation ofsuffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they delightin volitional formations that lead to birth, aging, and death; they delight involitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, anddespair. Delighting in such volitional formations, they generate volitionalformations that lead to birth, aging, and death; they generate volitionalformations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair.Having generated such volitional formations, they tumble down the precipice ofbirth, aging, and death; they tumble down the precipice of sorrow, lamentation,pain, dejection, and despair. They are not freed from birth, aging, and death;not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; not freed fromsuffering, I say.“But, monk, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is: ‘This issuffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do notdelight in volitional formations that lead to birth, aging, and death; they donot generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair. Not delighting in such volitional formations, they donot generate volitional formations that lead to birth, aging, and death; they donot generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair. Not having generated such volitional formations, they donot tumble down the precipice of birth, aging, and death; they do not tumbledown the precipice of sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair. Theyare freed from birth, aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain,dejection, and despair; freed from suffering, I say.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:42; V 448–50)(F) MAKING THE BREAKTHROUGH“Monks, if anyone should speak thus: ‘Without having made the breakthrough tothe noble truth of suffering as it really is, without having made thebreakthrough to the noble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is,without having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation ofsuffering as it really is, without having made the breakthrough to the nobletruth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is, I willcompletely make an end to suffering’—this is impossible.“Just as, monks, if someone should speak thus: ‘Having made a basket of acacialeaves or of pine needles or of myrobalan leaves,54 I will bring water or a palmfruit,’ this would be impossible; so too, if anyone should speak thus: ‘Withouthaving made the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is…Iwill completely make an end to suffering’—this is impossible.“But, monks, if anyone should speak thus: ‘Having made the breakthrough to thenoble truth of suffering as it really is, having made the breakthrough to thenoble truth of the origin of suffering as it really is, having made thebreakthrough to the noble truth of the cessation of suffering as it really is,having made the breakthrough to the noble truth of the way leading to thecessation of suffering as it really is, I will completely make an end tosuffering’—this is possible.“Just as, monks, if someone should speak thus: ‘Having made a basket of lotusleaves or of kino leaves or of māluva leaves, I will bring water or a palmfruit,’ this would be possible; so too, if anyone should speak thus: ‘Havingmade the breakthrough to the noble truth of suffering as it really is…I willcompletely make an end to suffering’—this is possible.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:32; V 442–43)(G) THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TAINTS“Monks, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees,not for one who does not know and does not see. For one who knows what, for onewho sees what, does the destruction of the taints come about? The destruction ofthe taints comes about for one who knows and sees: ‘This is suffering. This isthe origin of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the wayleading to the cessation of suffering.’ It is for one who knows thus, for onewho sees thus, that the destruction of the taints comes about.“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This issuffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leadingto the cessation of suffering.’”(SN 56:25; V 434)5. THE GOAL OF WISDOM(1) WHAT IS NIBBĀNA?On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling in Magadha atNālakagāma. Then the wanderer Jambukhādaka55 approached the VenerableSāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded theirgreetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the VenerableSāriputta:“Friend Sāriputta, it is said, ‘Nibbāna, Nibbāna.’ What now is Nibbāna?”“The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction ofdelusion: this, friend, is called Nibbāna.“But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the realization of thisNibbāna?”“There is a path, friend, there is a way for the realization of this Nibbāna.”“And what, friend, is that path, what is that way for the realization of thisNibbāna?”“It is, friend, this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention,right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,right concentration. This is the path, friend, this is the way for therealization of this Nibbāna.”“Excellent is the path, friend, excellent is the way for the realization of thisNibbāna. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for diligence.”(SN 38:1; IV 251–52)(2) THIRTY-THREE SYNONYMS FOR NIBBĀNA“Monks, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to theunconditioned. Listen ….“And what, monks, is the unconditioned? The destruction of lust, the destructionof hatred, the destruction of delusion: this is called the unconditioned.“And what, monks, is the path leading to the unconditioned?

These are the roots of trees, monks, these are empty huts.Meditate, monks, do not be negligent, lest you regret it later. This is myinstruction to you.”(SN 43:1–44, combined; IV 359–73)(3) THERE IS THAT BASEThus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī inJeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One wasinstructing, rousing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a Dhamma talkconnected with Nibbāna, and those monks were receptive and attentive,concentrating their whole mind, intent on listening to the Dhamma.Then, on realizing its significance, the Blessed One on that occasion utteredthis inspired utterance:“There is, monks, that base where there is neither earth, nor water, nor heat,nor air; neither the base of the infinity of space, nor the base of the infinityof consciousness, nor the base of nothingness, nor the base ofneither-perception-nor-non-perception; neither this world nor another world;neither sun nor moon.57 Here, monks, I say there is no coming, no going, nostanding still; no passing away and no being reborn. It is not established, notmoving, without support. Just this is the end of suffering.”(Ud 8:1; 80)(4) THE UNBORNThus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī inJeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One wasinstructing … the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Nibbāna, and thosemonks were receptive … intent on listening to the Dhamma.Then, on realizing its significance, the Blessed One on that occasion utteredthis inspired utterance:“There is, monks, an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned. If, monks, therewere no unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, no escape would be discernedfrom what is born, become, made, conditioned. But because there is an unborn,unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, therefore an escape is discerned from what isborn, become, made, conditioned.”(Ud 8:3; 80–81)(5) THE TWO NIBBĀNA ELEMENTS“There are, monks, these two Nibbāna elements. What are the two? The Nibbānaelement with residue remaining and the Nibbāna element without residueremaining.“And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element with residue remaining? Here, a monkis an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, donewhat had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterlydestroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through finalknowledge. However, his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, by which hestill experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure andpain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is calledthe Nibbāna element with residue remaining.“And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residue remaining? Here, amonk is an arahant, … one completely liberated through final knowledge. For him,here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will becomecool right here. That, monks, is called the Nibbāna element without residueremaining.“These, monks, are the two Nibbāna elements.”(It 44; 38)(6) THE FIRE AND THE OCEAN15. [The wanderer Vacchagotta asked the Blessed One:] “Then does Master Gotamahold any speculative view at all?” “Vaccha, ‘speculative view’ is something thatthe Tathāgata has put away. For the Tathāgata, Vaccha, has seen58 this: ‘Suchis form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling, such itsorigin, such its passing away; such is perception, such its origin, such itspassing away; such are volitional formations, such their origin, such theirpassing away; such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away.’Therefore, I say, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, andrelinquishing of all conceiving, all rumination, all I-making, mine-making, andthe underlying tendency to conceit, the Tathāgata is liberated through notclinging.”16. “When a monk’s mind is liberated thus, Master Gotama, where is he reborn[after death]?”“‘Is reborn’ does not apply, Vaccha.”“Then he is not reborn, Master Gotama?”“‘Is not reborn’ does not apply, Vaccha.”“Then he both is reborn and is not reborn, Master Gotama?”“‘Both is reborn and is not reborn’ does not apply, Vaccha.”“Then he neither is reborn nor is not reborn, Master Gotama?”“‘Neither is reborn nor is not reborn’ does not apply, Vaccha.”17. “When Master Gotama is asked these four questions, he replies: ‘“Is reborn”does not apply, Vaccha; “is not reborn” does not apply, Vaccha; “both is rebornand is not reborn” does not apply, Vaccha; “neither is reborn nor is not reborn”does not apply, Vaccha.’ Here I have fallen into bewilderment, Master Gotama,here I have fallen into confusion, and the measure of confidence I had gainedthrough previous conversation with Master Gotama has now disappeared.”18. “It is enough to cause you bewilderment, Vaccha, enough to cause youconfusion. For this Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see and hard tounderstand, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to beexperienced by the wise. It is hard for you to understand it when you holdanother view, accept another teaching, approve of another teaching, pursue adifferent training, and follow a different teacher. So I shall question youabout this in return, Vaccha. Answer as you choose.19. “What do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you. Wouldyou know: ‘This fire is burning before me’?”“I would, Master Gotama.”“If someone were to ask you, Vaccha: ‘What does this fire burning before youburn in dependence on?’—being asked thus, what would you answer?”“Being asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer: ‘This fire burning before meburns in dependence on grass and sticks.’”“If that fire before you were to be extinguished, would you know: ‘This firebefore me has been extinguished’?”“I would, Master Gotama.”“If someone were to ask you, Vaccha: ‘When that fire before you wasextinguished, to which direction did it go: to the east, the west, the north, orthe south?’—being asked thus, what would you answer?”“That does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on its fuelof grass and sticks. When that is used up, if it does not get any more fuel,being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.”20. “So too, Vaccha, the Tathāgata has abandoned that form by which onedescribing the Tathāgata might describe him; he has cut it off at the root,made it like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer subject tofuture arising. Liberated from reckoning in terms of form, the Tathāgata isdeep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the ocean. ‘Is reborn’ does not apply;‘is not reborn’ does not apply; ‘both is reborn and is not reborn’ does notapply; ‘neither is reborn nor is not reborn’ does not apply. The Tathāgata hasabandoned that feeling by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him… has abandoned that perception by which one describing the Tathāgata mightdescribe him … has abandoned those volitional formations by which one describingthe Tathāgata might describe him … has abandoned that consciousness by whichone describing the Tathāgata might describe him; he has cut it off at the root,made it like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer subject tofuture arising. Liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness, theTathāgata is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the ocean. ‘Is reborn’does not apply; ‘is not reborn’ does not apply; ‘both is reborn and is notreborn’ does not apply; ‘neither is reborn nor is not reborn’ does not apply.”(from MN 72: Aggivacchagotta Sutta; I 486–88)"},{"pageContent":"X. The Planes of Realization017 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_017_r1.jpg]INTRODUCTIONThe cultivation of wisdom, as we have seen, aims at the realization of Nibbāna.The Nikāyas stipulate a fixed series of stages through which a person passes onthe way toward the attainment of Nibbāna. In passing through these stages oneevolves from an “uninstructed worldling,” blind to the truths of the Dhamma,into an arahant, a liberated one, who has attained full comprehension of theFour Noble Truths and realized Nibbāna in this present life. I have alreadyreferred to several of these stages in the earlier chapters of this book. In thepresent chapter we will explore them in a more systematic manner.On entering the irreversible path to the attainment of Nibbāna, one becomes anoble person (ariyapuggala), the word “noble” (ariya) here denoting spiritualnobility. There are four major types of noble persons. Each stage is dividedinto two phases: the path (magga) and its fruition (phala).1[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en195] In the path phase, one issaid to be practicing for the attainment of a particular fruition, which one isbound to realize within that same life; in the resultant phase, one is said tobe established in that fruition. Thus the four major types of noble personsactually comprise four pairs or eight types of noble individuals. As enumeratedin Text X,1(1), these are: (1) one practicing for the realization of the fruitof stream-entry, (2) the stream-enterer, (3) one practicing for the realizationof the fruit of once-returning, (4) the once-returner, (5) one practicing forthe realization of the fruit of nonreturning, (6) the nonreturner, (7) onepracticing for arahantship, (8) the arahant. Text X,1(2) grades these eightaccording to the relative strength of their spiritual faculties, so that thoseat each subsequent stage possess stronger faculties than those at the precedingstage. The first seven persons are collectively known as sekhas, trainees ordisciples in the higher training; the arahant is called the asekha, the onebeyond training.The four main stages themselves are defined in two ways: (1) by way of thedefilements eradicated by the path leading to the corresponding fruit; and (2)by way of the destiny after death that awaits one who has realized thatparticular fruit. Text X,1(3) gives standard definitions of the four types thatmention both the defilements abandoned and their future destiny.The Nikāyas group the defilements abandoned into a set of ten fetters(saṃyojana). The stream-enterer abandons the first three fetters: identity view(sakkāyadiṭṭhi), that is, the view of a truly existent self either asidentical with the five aggregates or as existing in some relation to them;doubt (vicikicchā) about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, and the training;and the wrong grasp of rules and observances (sīlabbataparāmāsa ), the beliefthat mere external observances, particularly religious rituals and asceticpractices, can lead to liberation. The stream-enterer is assured of attainingfull enlightenment in at most seven more existences, which will all take placeeither in the human realm or the heavenly worlds. The stream-enterer will neverundergo an eighth existence and is forever freed from rebirth in the three lowerrealms—the hells, the realm of afflicted spirits, and the animal realm.The once-returner (sakadāgāmī) does not eradicate any new fetters. He or shehas eliminated the three fetters that the stream-enterer has destroyed andadditionally attenuates the three unwholesome roots—lust, hatred, anddelusion—so that they do not arise often and, when they do arise, do not becomeobsessive.2 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en196] As the nameimplies, the once-returner will come back to this world only one more time andthen make an end to suffering.The nonreturner (anāgāmī) eradicates the five “lower fetters.” That is, inaddition to the three fetters eliminated by the stream-enterer, the nonreturnereradicates two additional fetters, sensual lust and ill will. Becausenonreturners have eradicated sensual lust, they have no ties binding them to thesensual realm of existence. They thus take birth in the form realm(rūpadhātu), generally in one of five planes called the “pure abodes”(suddhāvāsa) reserved exclusively for the rebirth of nonreturners. They attainfinal Nibbāna there, without ever returning to the sensual realm.The nonreturner, however, is still bound by the five “higher fetters”: desirefor existence in the form realm, desire for existence in the formless realm,conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Those who cut off the five higher fettershave no more ties binding them to conditioned existence. These are the arahants,who have destroyed all defilements and are “completely liberated through finalknowledge.”The Four Classes of Noble Disciples By Way of Fetters Eliminated and Types ofRebirth RemainingClass of discipleFetters newly eliminatedRemaining types ofrebirthstream-entereridentity view, doubt, wrong grasp of rules andobservancesat most seven more births among humans and devasonce-returnernone,but weakens lust, hatred, and delusionone more birth in the sensesphererealmnonreturnersensual lust and ill willspontaneous birth in the formrealmarahantdesire for existence in form realm, desire for formless existence,conceit, restlessness, ignorancenoneBesides the four main classes of noble persons, the Nikāyas sometimes mention apair ranked just below the stream-enterer—see Text X,1(3). These two—called theDhamma-follower (dhammānusārī) and the faith-follower (saddhānusārī)—areactually two types belonging to the eighth category of noble disciples, theperson practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry. The Nikāyasinclude this pair to show that those on the way to stream-entry can bedistinguished into two classes by way of their dominant faculty. TheDhamma-follower is one for whom wisdom is dominant, the faith-follower one forwhom faith is dominant. It may be significant that at this stage prior to thefirst fruition, it is only faith and wisdom and not the other threefaculties—energy, mindfulness, and concentration—that serve to distinguishdisciples into different types.3[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en197]The explanation of the classes of noble disciples found in the above text, anextract from the Alagaddūpama Sutta (MN 22), may convey the impression that allthose who attain these stages are monks. This, however, is by no means the case.The Alagaddūpama extract is worded in this way only because it is addressed tomonks. Text X,1(4) corrects this impression and provides a clearer picture ofhow the classes of noble disciples are distributed among the groups of theBuddha’s followers. As an abiding state, arahantship is reserved for monks andnuns. This does not mean that only monks and nuns can attain arahantship; thesuttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining thefinal goal. However, such disciples either attain arahantship on the brink ofdeath or enter the monastic order very soon after their attainment. They do notcontinue to dwell at home as arahant householders, for dwelling at home isincompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving.In contrast, nonreturners can continue to dwell as householders. While theycontinue to live as lay disciples, they have eradicated sensual desire and thusnecessarily observe celibacy. They are described as “lay followers ... clothedin white, leading lives of celibacy, who, with the destruction of the five lowerfetters, will be reborn spontaneously [in the pure abodes] and there attainfinal Nibbāna without ever returning from that world.” Though the suttas do notexplicitly say this, it is reasonable to suppose that those disciples practicingto attain the fruit of nonreturning also observe full-time celibacy. Laystream-enterers and once-returners, however, are not necessarily celibate. Inthe sutta the Buddha describes them as “lay followers … clothed in white,enjoying sensual pleasures, who carry out my instruction, respond to my advice,have gone beyond doubt, become free from perplexity, gained intrepidity, andbecome independent of others in the Teacher’s dispensation.” Thus, while somestream-enterers and once-returners may observe celibacy, this is by no meanstypical of these two classes.The Nikāyas occasionally employ another scheme for classifying noble disciples,one that makes the dominant faculty rather than the level of attainment alonethe basis for differentiation. The main source for this scheme is a passage inthe Kīṭāgiri Sutta included here as Text X,1(5). This method ofclassification divides arahants into two categories: those liberated in bothways (ubhatobhāgavimutta) and those liberated by wisdom (paññāvimutta). Theformer are called “liberated in both ways” because they are liberated from formby their mastery over the formless meditations and liberated from alldefilements by their attainment of arahantship. Those arahants “liberated bywisdom” have not mastered the formless attainments but have gained the finalfruit by the power of their wisdom combined with degrees of concentration lowerthan the formless states.Those who have attained any of the lower stages, from stream-entry up to andincluding the path to arahantship, are divided into three categories. The“body-witness” (kāyasakkhī) is one at any of these stages who has mastered theformless attainments; the “one attained-to-view” (diṭṭhippatta), one at any ofthese stages who lacks the formless attainments and gives prominence to wisdom;and the “one liberated by faith” (saddhāvimutta), one at any of these stageswho lacks the formless attainments and gives prominence to faith. The last twopersons in this typology are the Dhamma-follower and the faith-followerexplained above.It should be noted that this scheme does not mention a person at the path ofstream-entry who possesses the formless attainments. This should not be taken tomean that such a type is in principle excluded but only that such a type wasconsidered irrelevant for purposes of classification. It seems that at thispreparatory stage, the allotment of a separate category to one with outstandingskills in concentration was deemed unnecessary.In the selection of texts, I next take up the main types for individualconsideration. I begin with the stream-enterer, but first some preliminarycomments are necessary. In the Nikāyas, the great majority of human beings arecalled “uninstructed worldlings” (assutavā puthujjana ). Uninstructedworldlings have no regard for the Buddha and his teaching, no understanding ofthe Dhamma or dedication to the practice. The purpose of the Buddha’s path is tolead uninstructed worldlings to the attainment of the Deathless, and the stagesof realization are the steps toward the completion of this process. The processof transformation generally begins when one encounters the Buddha’s teaching andgains confidence in the Buddha as the Enlightened One. One must then acquire aclear understanding of the Dhamma, undertake the precepts, and enter upon thesystematic practice of the path. In the suttas such a person is called a nobledisciple (ariyasāvaka) in a broad sense of the term, not necessarily in thenarrow, technical sense of one who has already reached the paths and fruits.Later tradition calls a person who has faith in the Dhamma and aspires to reachthe state of stream-entry a virtuous worldling (kalyāṇaputhujjana). To reachthe attainment of stream-entry, the aspiring disciple should cultivate the “fourfactors leading to stream-entry.” As Text X,2(1) explains, these are:associating with wise and virtuous spiritual guides; listening to the trueDhamma; attending carefully to things (for example, by way of gratification,danger, and escape); and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma (byundertaking the threefold training in moral discipline, concentration, andwisdom). The peak of the training undertaken by the aspiring disciple is thedevelopment of insight: the thorough contemplation of the aggregates, sensebases, and elements as impermanent, bound up with suffering, and devoid of asubstantial self. At a certain point, when insight reaches its peak, thedisciple’s understanding will undergo a major transition, which marks the entryupon “the fixed course of rightness,” the true Noble Eightfold Path that leadsirreversibly to Nibbāna. As Text X,2(2) puts it, such a disciple has risen upfrom the plane of worldlings and reached the plane of the noble ones. Though notyet a stream-enterer, a person at this stage cannot pass away without havingrealized the fruit of stream-entry.As we have already seen, among disciples who attain the path there is adistinction between those who arrive through faith, called faith-followers, andthose who arrive through wisdom, called Dhamma-followers. But whilefaith-followers and Dhamma-followers differ by way of their dominant faculty,they are alike in that both must further cultivate the path they have entered.Once they know and see the essence of the Dhamma—when they “obtain the vision ofthe Dhamma” and “make the breakthrough to the Dhamma”—they becomestream-enterers, bound to reach full enlightenment and attain final Nibbāna ina maximum of seven more lives; see Text X,2(3). Stream-enterers eradicate thefirst three fetters and acquire the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.They also have “four factors of stream-entry”: confirmed confidence in theBuddha, the Dhamma, and Saṅgha, and “the moral virtues dear to the noble ones,”that is, firm adherence to the five precepts; see Texts X,2(4)–(5).Having seen the truth of the Dhamma, the stream-enterer faces the challenge ofcultivating this vision in order to eliminate the remaining defilements. Thenext major milestone, the attainment of the plane of the once-returner, does noteliminate any defilements completely. However, it does attenuate the three rootdefilements—lust, hatred, and delusion—to a degree sufficient to ensure that thedisciple will return to “this world,” the sense-sphere realm of existence, onlyone more time and then make an end to suffering.A disciple who attains either of the first two stages, stream-enterer oronce-returner, need not remain fixed there but can advance to the two higherstages. Descriptions of attainment in the Nikāyas suggest that it is alsopossible for a virtuous worldling with extremely sharp faculties to advancedirectly to the stage of nonreturner. The state of nonreturner is always said tobe attained simply through the destruction of the five lower fetters, the threefetters eradicated by the stream-enterer along with sensual lust and ill will.From the Nikāyas, it appears that one with extremely sharp wisdom can achievethis stage at a single stroke. The commentaries, however, explain that in such acase the person actually passes through the first two paths and fruits in veryquick succession before reaching the third path and fruit.According to Text X,3(1), to abandon the five lower fetters, a monk firstattains one of the four jhānas or one of the three lower formless attainments;the constituent factors of the fourth formless attainment are too subtle toserve as objects of insight. Directing his attention to the factors constitutingthe jhāna or formless attainment,4[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en198] he subsumes them under thefive aggregates: as included in form (omitted in relation to the formlessattainments), feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness.Having done so, he contemplates these factors, now classified into the fiveaggregates, as marked by the three characteristics: impermanence, suffering, andnonself (expanded into eleven headings). As contemplation advances, at a certainpoint his mind turns away from all conditioned things and focuses upon thedeathless element, Nibbāna. If he has sharp faculties and can relinquish allattachments on the spot, he attains arahantship, the destruction of the taints;but if he cannot yet give up all attachments, he attains the state ofnonreturning.The Buddha recognized differences in the approaches individuals take toachieving the final goal, and in Text X,3(2) he divides persons into fourcategories with respect to its attainment. The four are obtained through thepermutations of two pairs. He first distinguishes disciples on the basis of thestrength of their spiritual faculties. Those with strong faculties reach finalNibbāna in this very life. Those with relatively weak faculties attain finalNibbāna in the next life, and thus presumably expire as nonreturners. The otherpair distinguishes disciples by their mode of development. One class takes the“difficult” approach, which uses meditation subjects that generate sharp wisdomand lead directly to disenchantment and dispassion. The other class takes thesmoother and more pleasant route leading through the four jhānas. These twotypes correspond roughly to those who give emphasis to insight and those whogive emphasis to serenity.A short sutta in the Sotāpattisaṃyutta, Text X,3(3), relates the story ofDīghāvu, a youth who took the difficult route emphasizing insight to the stageof nonreturner. Dīghāvu was lying on his deathbed when the Buddha came to himand asked him to train in the four factors of stream-entry. Dīghāvu said thathe was already endowed with these factors, indicating thereby that he was astream-enterer. The Buddha then instructed him to develop “six things thatpartake of true knowledge.” He evidently heeded the Buddha’s advice, for shortlyafter he died the Buddha declared him to have expired as a nonreturner. Thoughit is possible that Dīghāvu had already gained the jhānas and thus did notneed to be instructed in their practice, it is also possible that he attainedthe stage of nonreturner entirely through the power of the deep insight arisenfrom these six contemplations.Text X,3(4) makes further distinctions among those who attain arahantship andthe stage of nonreturner. Such suttas point to the great variety that can existeven among those at the same spiritual level. It is because he was able to makesuch distinctions that the Buddha was said to possess perfect understanding ofthe diversity in the faculties of sentient beings.Since nonreturners have eradicated the five lower fetters, they are no longerbound to the sensual realm of existence. However, they are still not entirelyliberated from the cycle of rebirths but are still bound by the five higherfetters: desire for existence in the form realm, desire for existence in theformless realm, the conceit “I am,” subtle restlessness, and ignorance. Theconceit “I am” (asmim̄na) differs from identity view, the view of self(sakkāyadiṭṭhi), to which it is partly akin. The view of self affirms anenduring self existing in relation to the five aggregates, either as identicalwith them, or as their inner core, or as their owner and master. But the conceit“I am” lacks a clear conceptual content. It lurks at the base of the mind as avague, shapeless, but imperious sense of the “I” as a concrete reality. Thoughthe view of self is already eliminated at the stage of stream-entry, the conceit“I am” persists in noble disciples even up to the stage of nonreturner. This isthe point of the incisive Khemaka Sutta—Text X,4(1)—with its two beautifulsimiles of the flower’s scent and the laundered cloth. The noble disciplesdiffer from ordinary people in that they do not buy into the conceit “I am.”They recognize the conceit “I am” as a mere figment of the imagination, a falsenotion that does not point to a self, to a truly existent “I.” But they have notcompletely overcome it.The subtle attachment and the residual sense of “I am” that persist in thenonreturner both stem from ignorance. To reach the end of the path, thenonreturner must obliterate the remaining segment of ignorance and dispel alltraces of craving and conceit. The critical point when ignorance, craving, andconceit are eradicated marks the transition from the stage of nonreturner toarahantship. The difference between the two can be a subtle one, and thereforestandards for distinguishing them are necessary. In Text X,4(2) the Buddhaproposes several criteria by which a trainee and an arahant can determine theirrespective standings. One of particular interest concerns their relationship tothe five spiritual faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, andwisdom. The trainee sees with wisdom the goal in which the facultiesculminate—namely, Nibbāna—but cannot dwell in it. The arahant sees with wisdomthe supreme goal and can also dwell in that goal.The texts that follow offer different perspectives on the arahant. Text X,4(3)characterizes the arahant with a series of metaphors, elucidated in the samepassage. Text X,4(4) enumerates nine things that an arahant cannot do. In TextX,4(5), the Venerable Sāriputta describes the arahant’s imperturbability in theface of powerful sense objects, and in Text X,4(6) he enumerates the ten powersof an arahant. Text X,4(7), an excerpt from the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta, begins asan account of the attainment of arahantship through the contemplation of theelements; the relevant passage was included in the previous chapter as TextIX,4(3)(c). The exposition then turns to the “four foundations” (cattāroadhiṭṭhāna) of the arahant, here spoken of as “the sage at peace” (munisanto). Text X,4(8), the last in this section, is a poem extolling the arahant’sdistinguished qualities.The first and foremost of the arahants is the Buddha himself, to whom the lastsection of this chapter is devoted. The section is titled “The Tathāgata,” theword the Buddha used when referring to himself in his archetypal role as thediscoverer and bringer of liberating truth. The word can be resolved in twoways: taken as tathā āgata, “Thus Come,” it implies that the Buddha has comein accordance with an established pattern (which the commentaries interpret tomean the fulfillment of the ten spiritual perfections—the pāramīs—and thethirty-seven aids to enlightenment); taken as tathā gata, “Thus Gone,” itimplies that he has gone in accordance with an established pattern (which thecommentaries interpret to mean that he has gone to Nibbāna by the completepractice of serenity, insight, the paths, and the fruits).Later forms of Buddhism draw extreme distinctions between Buddhas and arahants,but in the Nikāyas this distinction is not as sharp as one might expect if onetakes later texts as the benchmark of interpretation. On the one hand, theBuddha is an arahant, as is evident from the standard verse of homage to theBlessed One (iti pi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammā sambuddho ...); on the other,arahants are buddha, in the sense that they have attained full enlightenment,sambodhi, by awakening to the same truths that the Buddha himself realized. Theproper distinction, then, is that between a sammā sambuddha or PerfectlyEnlightened Buddha, and an arahant who has attained enlightenment and liberationas a disciple (s̄vaka) of a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha. However, to avoid suchcomplex locutions, we will resort to the common practice of phrasing thedistinction as that between a Buddha and an arahant.What then is the relationship between the two? Is the difference between themprimarily one of temporal sequence, with perhaps a few additional capacitiesspecific to a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha? Or is the difference between them sovast that they should be considered distinct types? The Nikāyas display aninteresting, even tantalizing, ambivalence on this question, as the textsincluded here illustrate. Text X,5(1) raises the question about the differencebetween “the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One” and “a monkliberated by wisdom”; apparently the expression bhikkhu paññāvimutta is usedhere in a sense applicable to any arahant disciple rather than solely to one wholacks the formless attainments (that is, in an inclusive sense, not as awisdom-liberated arahant contrasted with a both-ways liberated arahant). Theanswer the text gives expresses the difference in terms of role and temporalpriority. A Buddha has the function of discovering and expounding the path, andhe also possesses a unique familiarity with the intricacies of the path notshared by his disciples. His disciples follow the path he reveals and attainenlightenment afterward, under his guidance.The polemical literature of later Buddhism sometimes depicts the Buddha asmotivated by great compassion and his arahant disciples as cool and aloof,indifferent to the plight of their fellow beings. As if to forestall thiscriticism, Text X,5(2) states that not only the Buddha but arahants as well aslearned and virtuous disciples still in training arise for the welfare of manypeople, live their lives out of compassion for the world, and teach the Dhammafor the good, well-being, and happiness of their fellow beings, devas as well ashumans. Thus, if this text is taken as authoritative, it cannot be claimed thatcompassion and altruistic concern are qualities that distinguish Buddhas fromarahants.Yet Text X,5(3) gives us another perspective on this question. Here, the Buddhachallenges the Venerable Sāriputta’s “bellowing utterance” by asking himwhether he fully knows the moral discipline, qualities (perhaps concentration),wisdom, meditative dwellings, and liberation of the Buddhas of the past,present, and future. To this the great disciple can only answer in the negative.But Sāriputta declares that he knows that all the Buddhas of the three periodsof time attain perfect enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, byestablishing their minds in the four establishments of mindfulness, and bydeveloping correctly the seven factors of enlightenment.These, however, are aspects of the path that Buddhas have fulfilled in commonwith arahant disciples. Beyond this, the Buddhas possess certain qualities thatelevate them above even the foremost of the arahants. From the Nikāyas, theirsuperiority seems to rest on two main pillars: first, their being is essentially“for others” in a way that the most altruistic of the arahant disciples can onlyemulate but never equal; and second, their knowledges and spiritual powers aremuch greater than those of the arahant disciples.The Buddha states that even monks fully liberated in mind, who possess“unsurpassable vision, practice, and liberation,” venerate the Tathāgata,because his attainment of enlightenment helps others to attain enlightenment,his deliverance helps others gain deliverance, his realization of Nibbānaenables others to realize Nibbāna (MN 35.26; I 235). In Text X,5(4), weencounter two sets of qualities considered special endowments of a Buddha,enabling him to “roar his lion’s roar in the assemblies” and set rolling thewheel of Dhamma. These are the ten Tathāgata’s powers and the four grounds ofself-confidence. Though several of these powers are shared by disciples, intheir totality these two sets are distinctive of a Buddha and equip him to guideand instruct beings in accordance with their individual aptitudes anddispositions. The four grounds of self-confidence confer upon the Buddha aboldness of authority, a magnitude of mission, that only the founder of areligion can exercise. Text X,5(5) compares the Tathāgata to the sun and moon,for his appearance in the world is the manifestation of great light and dispelsthe darkness of ignorance. Text X,5(6) compares him to a man who rescues a herdof deer from calamity, thus portraying him as the great benefactor of humanity.With Text X,5(7) we return to the metaphor of the lion’s roar, introducedearlier, with a lengthy simile that compares the Buddha’s proclamation ofuniversal impermanence to the roar of a lion when he emerges from his den. Likethe closing passage of the First Sermon (see Text II,5), this text draws ourattention to the cosmic scope of the Buddha’s mission. His message extends notonly to human beings, but reaches up to the high heavenly realms, shaking thedelusions of the deities.Finally, Text X,5(8) offers us a series of brief explanations why the Buddha iscalled the Tathāgata. He is called the Tathāgata because he has fully awakenedto the nature of the world, its origin, its cessation, and the way to itscessation; because he has fully comprehended all phenomena within the world,whether seen, heard, sensed, or cognized; because his speech is invariably true;because he acts in conformity with his words; and because he wields suprememastery within the world. The text ends with an inspired poem, probably attachedby the compilers of the canon, which celebrates the Buddha as the supreme refugefor the world.The personal devotion toward the Tathāgata expressed by both the prose text andthe poem introduces us to the warm current of religious feeling that runsthrough Early Buddhism, always present just beneath its cool and composedexterior. This religious dimension makes the Dhamma more than just a philosophyor an ethical system or a body of meditative techniques. Animating it fromwithin, drawing its followers upward and onward, it makes the Dhamma a completespiritual path—a path rooted in faith in a particular person who is at once thesupreme teacher of liberating truth and the foremost example of the truth heteaches.X. THE PLANES OF REALIZATION1. THE FIELD OF MERIT FOR THE WORLD(1) EIGHT PERSONS WORTHY OF GIFTS“Monks, these eight persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthyof offerings, worthy of reverential salutations, the unsurpassed field of meritfor the world. What eight?“The stream-enterer, the one practicing for the realization of the fruit ofstream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for the realization of thefruit of once-returning; the nonreturner, the one practicing for the realizationof the fruit of the nonreturning; the arahant, the one practicing forarahantship.“Monks, these eight persons are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthyof offerings, worthy of reverential salutations, the unsurpassed field of meritfor the world.”(AN 8:59; IV 292)(2) DIFFERENTIATION BY FACULTIES“Monks, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of faith, thefaculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, thefaculty of wisdom. These are the five faculties.“One who has completed and fulfilled these five faculties is an arahant. If theyare weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit ofarahantship; if still weaker, one is a nonreturner; if still weaker, one ispracticing for the realization of the fruit of nonreturning; if still weaker,one is a once-returner; if still weaker, one is practicing for the realizationof the fruit of once-returning; if still weaker, one is a stream-enterer; ifstill weaker, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit ofstream-entry.“But, monks, I say that one in whom these five faculties are completely andtotally absent is ‘an outsider, one standing amid the worldlings.’”(SN 48:18; V 202)(3) IN THE DHAMMA WELL EXPOUNDED42. “Monks, the Dhamma well expounded by me thus is clear, open, evident, andfree of patchwork.

Here, monks, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence 23[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en217] in the Buddha thus: ‘TheBlessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledgeand conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to betamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ Hepossesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhamma is well expoundedby the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see,worthy of application, to be personally experienced by the wise.’ He possessesconfirmed confidence in the Saṅgha thus: ‘The Saṅgha of the Blessed One’sdisciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicingthe true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, theeight types of individuals—this Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthyof gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverentialsalutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’ He possesses themoral virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled,freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration.“A noble disciple, monks, who possesses these four things is a stream-enterer,no longer bound to the lower world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as hisdestination.”(SN 55:2; V 343–44)(5) BETTER THAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE EARTH“Monks, although a wheel-turning monarch, having exercised supreme sovereigntyover the four continents, with the breakup of the body, after death, is rebornin a good destination, in a heavenly world, in the company of the devas of theTāvatiṃsa realm, and there in the Nandana Grove, accompanied by a retinue ofcelestial nymphs, he enjoys himself supplied and endowed with the five cords ofcelestial sensual pleasure, still, as he does not possess four things, he is notfreed from hell, the animal realm, and the domain of afflicted spirits, notfreed from the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower world.24[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en218] Although, monks, a nobledisciple maintains himself by lumps of almsfood and wears rag-robes, still, ashe possesses four things, he is freed from hell, the animal realm, and thedomain of afflicted spirits, freed from the plane of misery, the baddestinations, the lower world.

NONRETURNING(1) ABANDONING THE FIVE LOWER FETTERS7. “There is a path and way, Ānanda, to the abandoning of the five lowerfetters. That anyone, without relying on that path and way, might know or see orabandon the five lower fetters—this is not possible. Just as when there is agreat tree standing possessed of heartwood, it is not possible that anyone mightcut out its heartwood without cutting through its bark and sapwood, so too, inthe case of abandoning the five lower fetters.“There is a path and way, Ānanda, to the abandoning of the five lower fetters.That someone, by relying on that path and way, might know and see and abandonthe five lower fetters—this is possible. Just as, when there is a great treestanding possessed of heartwood, it is possible that someone might cut out itsheartwood by cutting through its bark and sapwood, so too, in the case ofabandoning the five lower fetters.8. “Suppose, Ānanda, the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brimso that crows could drink from it, and then a feeble man came thinking: ‘Byswimming across the stream with my arms, I shall get safely across to thefurther shore of this river Ganges’; yet he would not be able to get safelyacross. So too, when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation ofidentity, if his mind does not enter into it and acquire confidence, steadiness,and resolution, then he can be regarded as like the feeble man.25[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en219]“Suppose, Ānanda, the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim sothat crows could drink from it, and then a strong man came thinking: ‘Byswimming across the stream with my arms, I shall get safely across to thefurther shore of this river Ganges’; and he would be able to get safely across.So too, when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation ofidentity, if his mind enters into it and acquires confidence, steadiness, andresolution, then he can be regarded as like the strong man.9. “And what, Ānanda, is the path and way to the abandoning of the five lowerfetters?

But if he doesnot attain the destruction of the taints, then through that very desire for theDhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, with the destruction of the five lowerfetters he becomes one due to be reborn spontaneously [in the pure abodes] andthere attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world.

Whatfour?“Here, monks, in this very life a person attains Nibbāna through volitionalexertion. Here, with the breakup of the body, a person attains final Nibbānathrough volitional exertion. Here, in this very life a person attains finalNibbāna without volitional exertion. Here, with the breakup of the body, aperson attains final Nibbāna without volitional exertion.“And how, monks, does a person, in this very life, attain Nibbāna throughvolitional exertion? Here, a monk dwells contemplating the unattractiveness ofthe body, perceiving repulsiveness in food, perceiving discontent with theentire world, contemplating impermanence in all formations; and the perceptionof death is well established within him.31[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en225] He dwells relying uponthese five powers of a trainee: the powers of faith, moral shame, fear ofwrongdoing, energy, and wisdom. These five faculties are extremely strong inhim: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.Because of the strength of these five faculties, in this very life he attainsNibbāna through volitional exertion. This is how a person, in this very life,attains Nibbāna through volitional exertion.“And how, monks, does a person, with the breakup of the body, attain Nibbānathrough volitional exertion? Here, a monk dwells contemplating theunattractiveness of the body ... and the perception of death is well establishedwithin him. He dwells relying upon these five powers of a trainee: the powers offaith ... and wisdom. These five faculties are relatively feeble in him: thefaculties of faith ... and wisdom. Because of the feebleness of these fivefaculties, with the breakup of the body, he attains Nibbāna through volitionalexertion. This is how a person, with the breakup of the body, attains Nibbānathrough volitional exertion.“And how, monks, does a person, in this very life, attain Nibbāna withoutvolitional exertion?

Now on that occasion the lay follower Dīghāvu wassick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the lay follower Dīghāvu addressed hisfather, the householder Jotika, thus: “Come, householder, approach the BlessedOne, pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet, and say:‘Venerable sir, the lay follower Dīghāvu is sick, afflicted, gravely ill; hepays homage to the Blessed One with his head at the Blessed One’s feet.’ Thensay: ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would come to theresidence of the lay follower Dīghāvu out of compassion.’”“Yes, dear,” the householder Jotika replied, and he approached the Blessed One,paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered his message. The BlessedOne consented by silence.Then the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the residence ofthe lay follower Dīghāvu. He then sat down in the appointed seat and said tothe lay follower Dīghāvu: “I hope you are bearing up, Dīghāvu, I hope youare getting better. I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and notincreasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned.”“Venerable sir, I am not bearing up, I am not getting better. Strong painfulfeelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not theirsubsiding, is to be discerned.”“Therefore, Dīghāvu, you should train yourself thus: ‘I will be one who hasconfirmed confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and whoobserves the moral virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken, untorn,unblemished, unmottled, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading toconcentration.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourself.”“Venerable sir, as to these four factors of stream-entry that have been taughtby the Blessed One, these things exist in me, and I live in conformity withthose things. For, venerable sir, I have confirmed confidence in the Buddha, theDhamma, and the Saṅgha, and I observe the moral virtues dear to the nobleones.”“Therefore, Dīghāvu, established upon these four factors of stream-entry, youshould develop further six things that partake of true knowledge. Here,Dīghāvu, dwell contemplating impermanence in all formations, perceivingsuffering in what is impermanent, perceiving nonself in what is suffering,perceiving abandonment, perceiving fading away, perceiving cessation.32[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en226] It is in such a way thatyou should train yourself.”“Venerable sir, as to these six things that partake of true knowledge that havebeen taught by the Blessed One, these things exist in me, and I live inconformity with those things. For, venerable sir, I dwell contemplatingimpermanence in all formations, perceiving suffering in what is impermanent,perceiving nonself in what is suffering, perceiving abandonment, perceivingfading away, perceiving cessation. However, venerable sir, I hope that after Iexpire, my father won’t be distressed.”“Don’t be concerned about this, dear Dīghāvu. Come now, dear Dīghāvu, payclose attention to what the Blessed One is saying to you.”Then the Blessed One, having given this exhortation to the lay followerDīghāvu, rose from his seat and departed. Then, not long after the Blessed Onehad left, the lay follower Dīghāvu died.Then a number of monks approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat downto one side, and said: “Venerable sir, the lay follower Dīghāvu has died. Whatis his destination? Where was he reborn?”“Monks, the lay follower Dīghāvu was wise. He practiced in accordance with theDhamma and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma. With the utterdestruction of the five lower fetters, the lay follower Dīghāvu has become oneof spontaneous birth [in the pure abodes], due to attain Nibbāna there withoutreturning from that world.”(SN 55:3; V 344–46)(4) FIVE KINDS OF NONRETURNERS“Monks, when these seven factors of enlightenment have been developed andcultivated in this way, seven fruits and benefits may be expected. What are theseven fruits and benefits?“One attains final knowledge (of arahantship) early in this very life.“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life, then oneattains final knowledge at the time of death.“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life or at the timeof death, then with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters one attainsNibbāna in the interval.33 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en227]“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life ... or attainNibbāna in the interval, then with the utter destruction of the five lowerfetters one attains Nibbāna upon landing.“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life ... or attainNibbāna upon landing, then with the utter destruction of the five lower fettersone attains Nibbāna without volitional exertion.“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life ... or attainNibbāna without volitional exertion, then with the utter destruction of thefive lower fetters one attains Nibbāna with volitional exertion.“If one does not attain final knowledge early in this very life ... or attainNibbāna with volitional exertion, then with the utter destruction of the fivelower fetters one becomes one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭharealm.“When, monks, the seven factors of enlightenment have been developed andcultivated in this way, these seven fruits and benefits may be expected.”(SN 46:3; V 69–70)4. THE ARAHANT(1) REMOVING THE RESIDUAL CONCEIT “I AM”On one occasion a number of elder monks were dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’sPark. Now on that occasion the Venerable Khemaka was living at Jujube Tree Park,sick, afflicted, gravely ill.Then, in the evening, those elder monks emerged from seclusion and addressed theVenerable Dāsaka thus: “Come, friend Dāsaka, approach the monk Khemaka and sayto him: ‘The elders say to you, friend Khemaka: We hope that you are bearing up,friend, we hope that you are getting better. We hope that your painful feelingsare subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase,is to be discerned.’”“Yes, friends,” the Venerable Dāsaka replied, and he approached the VenerableKhemaka and delivered his message.[The Venerable Khemaka answered:] “I am not bearing up, friend, I am not gettingbetter. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and theirincrease, not their subsiding, is to be discerned.”Then the Venerable Dāsaka approached the elder monks and reported what theVenerable Khemaka had said. They told him: “Come, friend Dāsaka, approach themonk Khemaka and say to him: ‘The elders say to you, friend Khemaka: These fiveaggregates subject to clinging have been spoken of by the Blessed One; that is,form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Does theVenerable Khemaka regard anything as self or as belonging to self among thesefive aggregates subject to clinging?’”“Yes, friends,” the Venerable Dāsaka replied, and he approached the VenerableKhemaka and delivered his message.[The Venerable Khemaka replied:] “These five aggregates subject to clinging havebeen spoken of by the Blessed One; that is, form, feeling, perception,volitional formations, and consciousness. Among these five aggregates subject toclinging, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self.”Then the Venerable Dāsaka approached the elder monks and reported what theVenerable Khemaka had said. They replied: “Come, friend Dāsaka, approach themonk Khemaka and say to him: If the Venerable Khemaka does not regard anythingamong these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then he is anarahant, one whose taints are destroyed.’”34[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en228]“Yes, friends,” the Venerable Dāsaka replied, and he approached the VenerableKhemaka and delivered his message.[The Venerable Khemaka replied:] “These five aggregates subject to clinging havebeen spoken of by the Blessed One; that is, form, feeling, perception,volitional formations, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among thesefive aggregates subject to clinging as self or as belonging to self, yet I amnot an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed. Friends, [the notion] ‘I am’ hasnot yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject to clinging,but I do not regard [anything among them] as ‘This I am.’”35[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en229]Then the Venerable Dāsaka approached the elder monks and reported what theVenerable Khemaka had said. They replied: “Come, friend Dāsaka, approach themonk Khemaka and say to him: ‘The elders say to you, friend Khemaka: FriendKhemaka, when you speak of this “I am”—what is it that you speak of as “I am”?Do you speak of form as “I am,” or do you speak of “I am” apart from form? Doyou speak of feeling ... of perception ... of volitional formations ... ofconsciousness as “I am,” or do you speak of “I am” apart from consciousness?When you speak of this “I am,” friend Khemaka, what is it that you speak of as“I am”?’”“Yes, friends,” the Venerable Dāsaka replied, and he approached the VenerableKhemaka and delivered his message.“Enough, friend Dāsaka! Why keep running back and forth? Bring me my staff,friend. I’ll go to the elder monks myself.”Then the Venerable Khemaka, leaning on his staff, approached the elder monks,exchanged greetings with them, and sat down to one side. The elder monks thensaid to him: “Friend Khemaka, when you speak of this ‘I am’ ... what is it thatyou speak of as ‘I am’?”“Friends, I do not speak of form as ‘I am,’ nor do I speak of ‘I am’ apart fromform. I do not speak of feeling as ‘I am’ ... nor of perception as ‘I am’ ...nor of volitional formations as ‘I am’ ... nor of consciousness as ‘I am,’ nordo I speak of ‘I am’ apart from consciousness. Friends, although [the notion] ‘Iam’ has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregates subject toclinging, still I do not regard [anything among them] as ‘This I am.’“Suppose, friends, there is the scent of a blue, red, or white lotus. Would onebe speaking rightly if one would say, ‘The scent belongs to the petals,’ or ‘Thescent belongs to the stalk,’ or ‘The scent belongs to the pistils’?”“No, friend.”“And how, friends, should one answer if one is to answer rightly?”“Answering rightly, friend, one should answer: ‘The scent belongs to theflower.’”“So too, friends, I do not speak of form as ‘I am,’ nor do I speak of ‘I am’apart from form. I do not speak of feeling as ‘I am’ … nor of perception as ‘Iam’ ... nor of volitional formations as ‘I am’ ... nor of consciousness as ‘Iam,’ nor do I speak of ‘I am’ apart from consciousness. Friends, although [thenotion] ‘I am’ has not yet vanished in me in relation to these five aggregatessubject to clinging, still I do not regard [anything among them] as ‘This I am.’“Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters,still, in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging, there lingers inhim a residual conceit ‘I am,’ a desire ‘I am,’ an underlying tendency ‘I am’that has not yet been uprooted. Sometime later he dwells contemplating rise andfall in the five aggregates subject to clinging: ‘Such is form, such its origin,such its passing away; such is feeling ... such is perception ... such arevolitional formations … such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passingaway.’ As he dwells thus contemplating rise and fall in the five aggregatessubject to clinging, the residual conceit ‘I am,’ the desire ‘I am,’ theunderlying tendency ‘I am’ that had not yet been uprooted—this comes to beuprooted.“Suppose, friends, a cloth has become soiled and stained, and its owners give itto a laundryman. The laundryman would scour it evenly with cleaning salt, lye,or cow dung, and rinse it in clean water. Even though that cloth would becomepure and clean, it would still retain a residual smell of cleaning salt, lye, orcow dung that had not yet vanished. The laundryman would then give it back tothe owners. The owners would put it in a sweet-scented chest, and the residualsmell of cleaning salt, lye, or cow dung that had not yet vanished wouldvanish.36 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en230]“So too, friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lowerfetters, still, in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging, therelingers in him a residual conceit ‘I am,’ a desire ‘I am,’ an underlyingtendency ‘I am’ that has not yet been uprooted…. As he dwells thus contemplatingrise and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging, the residual conceit‘I am,’ the desire ‘I am,’ the underlying tendency ‘I am’ that had not yet beenuprooted—this comes to be uprooted.”When this was said, the elder monks said to the Venerable Khemaka: “We did notask our questions in order to trouble the Venerable Khemaka, but we thought thatthe Venerable Khemaka would be capable of explaining, teaching, proclaiming,establishing, disclosing, analyzing, and elucidating the Blessed One’s teachingin detail. And the Venerable Khemaka has explained, taught, proclaimed,established, disclosed, analyzed, and elucidated the Blessed One’s teaching indetail.”Thus the elder monks were elated and delighted in the Venerable Khemaka’sstatement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty eldermonks and of the Venerable Khemaka were liberated from the taints bynonclinging.(SN 22:89; III 126–32)(2) THE TRAINEE AND THE ARAHANTAt Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park the Blessed One addressed the monks thus:“There is a method, monks, by means of which a monk who is a trainee, standingon the plane of a trainee, might understand: ‘I am a trainee,’ while a monkbeyond training, standing on the plane of one beyond training, might understand:‘I am one beyond training.’“And what, monks, is the method by means of which a monk who is a trainee,standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: ‘I am a trainee’?“Here, monks, a monk who is a trainee understands as it really is: ‘This issuffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering.This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This is a method bymeans of which a monk who is a trainee, standing on the plane of a trainee,understands: ‘I am a trainee.’“Again, monks, a monk who is a trainee considers thus: ‘Is there outside here37[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en231] another ascetic or brahminwho teaches a Dhamma so real, true, and actual as the Blessed One does?’ Heunderstands thus: ‘There is no other ascetic or brahmin outside here who teachesa Dhamma so real, true, and actual as the Blessed One does.’ This too is amethod by means of which a monk who is a trainee, standing on the plane of atrainee, understands: ‘I am a trainee.’“Again, monks, a monk who is a trainee understands the five spiritualfaculties—the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, andwisdom. He does not yet dwell having contacted with the body that which is theirdestination, their culmination, their fruit, their final goal; but havingpierced it through with wisdom, he sees.38[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en232] This too is a method bymeans of which a monk who is a trainee, standing on the plane of a trainee,understands: ‘I am a trainee.’“And what, monks, is the method by means of which a monk beyond training,standing on the plane of one beyond training, understands: ‘I am one beyondtraining’? Here, monks, a monk beyond training understands the five spiritualfaculties—the faculties of faith ... wisdom. He dwells having contacted with thebody that which is their destination, their culmination, their fruit, theirfinal goal; and having pierced it through with wisdom, he sees. This is a methodby means of which a monk beyond training, standing on the plane of one beyondtraining, understands: ‘I am one beyond training.’“Again, monks, a monk beyond training understands the six faculties—the eyefaculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the bodyfaculty, the mind faculty. He understands: ‘These six faculties will ceasecompletely and totally without remainder, and no other six faculties will ariseanywhere in any way.’ This too is a method by means of which a monk beyondtraining, standing on the plane of one beyond training, understands: ‘I am onebeyond training.’”(SN 48:53: V 229–30)(3) A MONK WHOSE CROSSBAR HAS BEEN LIFTED30. “Monks, an arahant is called one whose crossbar has been lifted, whosetrench has been filled in, whose pillar has been uprooted, one who has no bolt,a noble one whose banner is lowered, whose burden is lowered, who is unfettered.31. “And how is the arahant one whose crossbar has been lifted? Here the arahanthas abandoned ignorance, has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump,done away with it, so that it is no longer subject to future arising. That ishow he is one whose crossbar has been lifted.32. “And how is the arahant one whose trench has been filled in? Here thearahant has abandoned the round of rebirths, the process of renewed existence,has cut it off at the root ... so that it is no longer subject to futurearising. That is how he is one whose trench has been filled in.33. “And how is the arahant one whose pillar has been uprooted? Here the arahanthas abandoned craving, has cut it off at the root ... so that it is no longersubject to future arising. That is how he is one whose pillar has been uprooted.34. “And how is the arahant one who has no bolt? Here the monk has abandoned thefive lower fetters, has cut them off at the root ... so that they are no longersubject to future arising. That is how he is one who has no bolt.35. “And how is the arahant a noble one whose banner is lowered, whose burden islowered, who is unfettered? Here the arahant has abandoned the conceit ‘I am,’has cut it off at the root ... so that it is no longer subject to futurearising. That is how he is a noble one whose banner is lowered, whose burden islowered, who is unfettered.”(from MN 22: Alagaddūpama Sutta; I 139–40)(4) NINE THINGS AN ARAHANT CANNOT DO“In the past, and also now, I declare that a monk who is an arahant with taintsdestroyed—one who has lived the spiritual life, done his task, laid down theburden, attained his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, andbecome liberated by final knowledge—is incapable of transgression in regard tonine things: he is incapable of destroying life, of taking what is not given, ofengaging in the sexual act, of telling a deliberate lie, and of making use ofstored-up enjoyments as he did in the past when he was a householder; further,he is incapable of taking a wrong course of action on account of desire, onaccount of hatred, on account of delusion, or on account of fear. In the past,and also now, I declare that a monk who is an arahant is incapable oftransgression in regard to these nine things.”(from AN 9:7; IV 370–71)(5) A MIND UNSHAKEN[The Venerable Sāriputta said:] “When, friend, a monk is thus liberated inmind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of his eye,they do not obsess his mind; his mind remains uncontaminated, steady, attainedto imperturbability, and he contemplates their fall. Even if powerful soundscognizable by the ear … smells cognizable by the nose … flavors cognizable bythe tongue … tactile objects cognizable by the body … mental phenomenacognizable by the mind come into range of his mind, they do not obsess his mind;his mind remains uncontaminated, steady, attained to imperturbability, and hecontemplates their fall. Suppose, friend, there were a stone pillar sixteenmeters long, eight meters sunk in the ground and eight meters above the ground.Then a powerful rainstorm would come from the east: the pillar would not budge,would not shake, would not tremble. Then a powerful rainstorm would come fromthe north ... from the west ... from the south: the pillar would not budge,would not shake, would not tremble. Why not? Because of the depth of the baseand because the stone pillar has been deeply planted. So too for a monk thusliberated in mind, if powerful sense objects come into range, they do not obsesshis mind; his mind remains uncontaminated, steady, attained to imperturbability,and he contemplates their fall.”(from AN 9:26; IV 404–5)(6) THE TEN POWERS OF AN ARAHANT MONKThe Buddha asked the Venerable Sāriputta: “How many powers does an arahant monkhave, Sāriputta, possessing which he claims that he has attained thedestruction of the taints?”“The arahant monk has ten powers, venerable sir, possessing which he claims thathe has attained the destruction of the taints. What ten?“Here, venerable sir, for an arahant monk all formations have been well seen asthey really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. This is a power of anarahant monk on the basis of which he claims that he has attained thedestruction of the taints.“Again, venerable sir, for an arahant monk sensual pleasures have been well seenas they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit. This too isa power of an arahant monk ...“Again, venerable sir, the mind of an arahant monk slants, slopes, and inclinesto seclusion; it dwells in seclusion, delights in renunciation, and is entirelyfinished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This too is a power ofan arahant monk.…“Further, venerable sir, for an arahant monk the four establishments ofmindfulness have been developed to the point that they are well developed. Thistoo is a power of an arahant monk.…“Further, venerable sir, for an arahant monk the four right kinds of striving …the four bases for spiritual power … the five spiritual faculties ... the fivepowers ... the seven factors of enlightenment ... the Noble Eightfold Path hasbeen developed to the point that it is well developed. This too is a power of anarahant monk on the basis of which he claims that he has attained thedestruction of the taints.”39[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en233](AN 10:90; V 174–75)(7) THE SAGE AT PEACE20. [The Buddha further addressed Pukkusāti thus:] “Then [after contemplatingthe six elements], there remains only equanimity, purified and bright,malleable, wieldy, and radiant.40[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en234] ...21. “He understands thus: ‘If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified andbright, to the base of the infinity of space and to develop my mind accordingly,then this equanimity of mine, supported by this base, clinging to it, wouldremain for a very long time.41[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en235] If I were to direct thisequanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of the infinity of consciousness… to the base of nothingness … to the base ofneither-perception-nor-non-perception and to develop my mind accordingly, thenthis equanimity of mine, supported by this base, clinging to it, would remainfor a very long time.’22. “He understands thus: ‘If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified andbright, to the base of the infinity of space and to develop my mind accordingly,this would be conditioned.42[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en236] If I were to direct thisequanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of the infinity of consciousness… to the base of nothingness … to the base ofneither-perception-nor-non-perception and to develop my mind accordingly, thiswould be conditioned.’ He does not construct or generate any volition tendingtoward either existence or non-existence.43[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en237] Since he does not constructor generate any volition tending toward either existence or nonexistence, hedoes not cling to anything in this world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Notbeing agitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Birth isdestroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done,there is no more coming back to any state of being.’44[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en238]23. “If he feels a pleasant feeling,45[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en239] he understands: ‘It isimpermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.’ If he feelsa painful feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent; there is no holding toit; there is no delight in it.’ If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent; there is no holding to it; there isno delight in it.’24. “If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painfulfeeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasantfeeling, he feels it detached. When he feels a feeling terminating with thebody, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with the body.’ When hefeels a feeling terminating with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feelingterminating with life.’ He understands: ‘On the dissolution of the body, withthe ending of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become coolright here.’46 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en240] Monk, justas an oil-lamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick, and when the oil and wickare used up, if it does not get any more fuel, it is extinguished from lack offuel; so too when he feels a feeling terminating with the body ... a feelingterminating with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with life.’He understands: ‘On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, allthat is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’47[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en241]25. “Therefore a monk possessing [this wisdom] possesses the supreme foundationof wisdom. For this, monk, is the supreme noble wisdom, namely, the knowledge ofthe destruction of all suffering.26. “His liberation, being founded upon truth, is unshakable. For that is false,monk, which has a deceptive nature, and that is true which has an undeceptivenature—Nibbāna. Therefore a monk possessing [this truth] possesses the supremefoundation of truth. For this, monk, is the supreme noble truth, namely,Nibbāna, which has an undeceptive nature.48[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en242]27. “Formerly, when he was ignorant, he undertook and accepted acquisitions;49[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en243] now he has abandoned them,cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them sothat they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a monk possessing[this relinquishment] possesses the supreme foundation of relinquishment. Forthis, monk, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely, the relinquishing ofall acquisitions.28. “Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced covetousness, desire, andlust; now he has abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palmstump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced anger, ill will, and hate; now hehas abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, doneaway with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Formerly,when he was ignorant, he experienced ignorance and delusion; now he hasabandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done awaywith them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a monkpossessing [this peace] possesses the supreme foundation of peace. For this,monk, is the supreme noble peace, namely, the pacification of lust, hate, anddelusion.29. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not neglectwisdom, should preserve truth, should cultivate relinquishment, and should trainfor peace.’30. “‘The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these[foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he iscalled a sage at peace.’50 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en244]So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?31. “Monk, ‘I am’ is a conceiving; ‘I am this’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be’ isa conceiving; ‘I shall not be’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall have a physical form’is a conceiving; ‘I shall be formless’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be percipient’is a conceiving; ‘I shall be nonpercipient’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall beneither-percipient-nor-nonpercipient’ is a conceiving.51[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en245] Conceiving is a disease,conceiving is a tumor, conceiving is a dart. By overcoming all conceivings,monk, one is called a sage at peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does notage, does not die; he is not shaken and does not yearn. For there is nothingpresent in him by which he might be born.52[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en246] Not being born, how couldhe age? Not aging, how could he die? Not dying, how could he be shaken? Notbeing shaken, why should he yearn?32. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The tides of conceivingdo not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides ofconceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.’”(from MN 140: Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta; III 244–47)(8) HAPPY INDEED ARE THE ARAHANTSHappy indeed are the arahants!No craving can be found in them.Cut off is the conceit “I am,”Burst asunder is delusion’s net. They have reached the unstirred state,Limpid are their minds;They are unsullied in the world—The holy ones, without taints.Having fully understood the five aggregates,Ranging in the seven good qualities,53[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en247]Those praiseworthy superior personsAre the Buddha’s bosom offspring.

Above, across, and below,Delight is no more found in them.They boldly sound their lion’s roar:“The enlightened are supreme in the world.”(from SN 22:76; III 83–84)5. THE TATHĀGATA(1) THE BUDDHA AND THE ARAHANT“Monks, through disenchantment with form, feeling, perception, volitionalformations, and consciousness, through their fading away and cessation, theTathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is liberated bynonclinging; he is called a Perfectly Enlightened One. Through disenchantmentwith form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness,through their fading away and cessation, a monk liberated by wisdom is liberatedby nonclinging; he is called one liberated by wisdom.57[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en251]“Therein, monks, what is the distinction, the disparity, the difference betweenthe Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and a monk liberatedby wisdom?”“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by theBlessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the BlessedOne would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, themonks will remember it.”“Then listen and attend closely, monks, I will speak.”“Yes, venerable sir,” the monks replied. The Blessed One said this:“The Tathāgata, monks, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is theoriginator of the path unarisen before, the producer of the path unproducedbefore, the declarer of the path undeclared before. He is the knower of thepath, the discoverer of the path, the one skilled in the path. And his disciplesnow dwell following that path and become possessed of it afterward.“This, monks, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between theTathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and a monk liberated bywisdom.”(SN 22:58; III 65–66)(2) FOR THE WELFARE OF MANY“Monks, these three persons arise in the world for the welfare of the multitude,for the happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for thegood, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. What three?“Here, monks, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectlyenlightened … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.He teaches the Dhamma that is good at the beginning, good in the middle, good atthe end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals the spiritual life thatis utterly perfect and pure. This, monks, is the first person that arises in theworld for the welfare of the multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, outof compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas andhumans.“Then, monks, a disciple of that teacher is an arahant with taints destroyed [asin Text X,1(3), §42} … completely liberated through final knowledge. He teachesthe Dhamma that is good at the beginning … he reveals the spiritual life that isutterly perfect and pure. This, monks, is the second person that arises in theworld for the welfare of the multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, outof compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas andhumans.“Then, monks, a disciple of that teacher is a trainee practicing the path,learned and endowed with precepts and observances. He too teaches the Dhammathat is good at the beginning … he reveals the spiritual life that is utterlyperfect and pure. This, monks, is the third person that arises in the world forthe welfare of the multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, out ofcompassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas andhumans.“These, monks, are the three persons that arise in the world for the welfare ofthe multitude, for the happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for theworld, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.”(It 84; 78–79)(3) SĀRIPUTTA’S LOFTY UTTERANCEThe Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, satdown to one side, and said: “Venerable sir, I have such confidence in theBlessed One that I believe there has not been, nor ever will be, nor exists atpresent another ascetic or brahmin more knowledgeable than the Blessed One withrespect to enlightenment.”58[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en252]“Lofty indeed is this bellowing utterance of yours, Sāriputta, you have roareda definitive lion’s roar. Have you now, Sāriputta, encompassed with your mindthe minds of all the Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, arisen in thepast and known thus: ‘Those Blessed Ones were of such moral discipline, or ofsuch qualities, or of such wisdom, or of such meditative dwellings, or of suchliberation’?”59 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en253]“No, venerable sir.”“Then, Sāriputta, have you encompassed with your mind the minds of all theArahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, who will arise in the future and knownthus: ‘Those Blessed Ones will be of such moral discipline, or of suchqualities, or of such wisdom, or of such meditative dwellings, or of suchliberation’?”“No, venerable sir.”“Then, Sāriputta, have you encompassed with your mind my own mind—I being atpresent the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One—and known thus: ‘The BlessedOne is of such moral discipline, or of such qualities, or of such wisdom, or ofsuch meditative dwellings, or of such liberation’?”“No, venerable sir.”“Sāriputta, when you do not have any knowledge encompassing the minds of theArahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past, the future, and thepresent, why do you utter this lofty, bellowing utterance and roar thisdefinitive lion’s roar: ‘Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the BlessedOne that I believe there has not been, nor ever will be, nor exists at presentanother ascetic or brahmin more knowledgeable than the Blessed One with respectto enlightenment’?”“I do not have, venerable sir, any knowledge encompassing the minds of theArahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past, the future, and thepresent, but still I have understood this by inference from the Dhamma. Suppose,venerable sir, a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts, walls, andarches, and a single gate. The gatekeeper posted there would be wise, competent,and intelligent; one who keeps out strangers and admits acquaintances. While heis walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or anopening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through. He might think:‘Whatever large creatures enter or leave this city, all enter and leave throughthis one gate.’“So too, venerable sir, I have understood this by inference from the Dhamma:Whatever Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones arose in the past, all thoseBlessed Ones had first abandoned the five hindrances, defilements of the mindthat weaken wisdom; and then, with their minds well established in the fourestablishments of mindfulness, developed correctly the seven factors ofenlightenment; and thereby they had awakened to the unsurpassed perfectenlightenment. And, venerable sir, whatever Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Oneswill arise in the future, all those Blessed Ones will first abandon the fivehindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom; and then, with theirminds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, will developcorrectly the seven factors of enlightenment; and thereby they will awaken tothe unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. And, venerable sir, the Blessed One, atpresent the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, first abandoned the fivehindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom; and then, with his mindwell established in the four establishments of mindfulness, developed correctlythe seven factors of enlightenment; and thereby he has awakened to theunsurpassed perfect enlightenment.”“Good, good, Sāriputta! Therefore, Sāriputta, you should repeat this Dhammaexposition frequently to the monks and the nuns, to the male lay followers andthe female lay followers. Even though some foolish people may have perplexity oruncertainty regarding the Tathāgata, when they hear this Dhamma expositiontheir perplexity or uncertainty will be abandoned.”(SN 47:12; V 159–61)(4) THE POWERS AND GROUNDS OF SELF-CONFIDENCE9. “Sāriputta, the Tathāgata has these ten Tathāgata’s powers, possessingwhich he claims the place of the chief of the herd, roars his lion’s roar in theassemblies, and sets rolling the wheel of Brahmā.60[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en254] What are the ten?10.

(7) “Again, the Tathāgata correctly understands the defilement, thecleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, liberations,concentrations, and attainments.

(9) “Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior,fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass onaccording to their actions. That too is a Tathāgata’s power…19. (10) “Again, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, theTathāgata in this present life enters upon and dwells in the liberation ofmind, liberation by wisdom, that is taintless with the destruction of thetaints. That too is a Tathāgata’s power that the Tathāgata has, by virtue ofwhich he claims the place of the leader of the herd, roars his lion’s roar inthe assemblies, and sets rolling the wheel of Brahmā.20. “The Tathāgata has these ten Tathāgata’s powers, possessing which heclaims the place of the leader of the herd, roars his lion’s roar in theassemblies, and sets rolling the wheel of Brahmā.…22. “Sāriputta, the Tathāgata has these four grounds of self-confidence, 67[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en261] possessing which he claimsthe place of the leader of the herd, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies,and sets rolling the wheel of Brahmā. What are the four?23. “Here, I see no ground on which any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra orBrahmā or anyone else at all in the world could, in accordance with the Dhamma,accuse me thus: ‘While you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are notperfectly enlightened about these things.’ And seeing no ground for that, Idwell in safety, fearlessness, and self-confidence.24. “I see no ground on which any ascetic... or anyone at all could accuse methus: ‘While you claim to be one who has destroyed the taints, you have notdestroyed these taints.’ And seeing no ground for that, I dwell in safety,fearlessness, and self-confidence.25. “I see no ground on which any ascetic... or anyone at all could accuse methus: ‘Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one whoengages in them.’ And seeing no ground for that, I dwell in safety,fearlessness, and self-confidence.26. “I see no ground on which any ascetic... or anyone at all could accuse methus: ‘When you teach the Dhamma to someone, it does not lead him when hepractices it to the complete destruction of suffering.’ And seeing no ground forthat, I dwell in safety, fearlessness, and self-confidence.27. “A Tathāgata has these four kinds of self-confidence, possessing which heclaims the place of the leader of the herd, roars his lion’s roar in theassemblies, and sets rolling the wheel of Brahmā.”(from MN 12: Mahāsīhanāda Sutta; I 70–72)(5) THE MANIFESTATION OF GREAT LIGHT“Monks, so long as the sun and moon have not arisen in the world, for just solong there is no manifestation of great light and radiance, but then blindingdarkness prevails, a dense mass of darkness; for just so long day and night arenot discerned, the month and fortnight are not discerned, the seasons and theyear are not discerned. But, monks, when the sun and moon arise in the world,then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance; then there is noblinding darkness, no dense mass of darkness; then day and night are discerned,the month and fortnight are discerned, the seasons and year are discerned.“So too, monks, so long as a Tathāgata has not arisen in the world, an Arahant,a Perfectly Enlightened One, for just so long there is no manifestation of greatlight and radiance, but then blinding darkness prevails, a dense mass ofdarkness; for just so long there is no explaining, teaching, proclaiming,establishing, disclosing, analyzing, or elucidating of the Four Noble Truths.But, monks, when a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, a PerfectlyEnlightened One, then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance;then no blinding darkness prevails, no dense mass of darkness; then there is theexplaining, teaching, proclaiming, establishing, disclosing, analyzing, andelucidating of the Four Noble Truths.”(SN 56:38; V 442–43)(6) THE MAN DESIRING OUR GOOD25. “Suppose, monks, that in a wooded range there were a great low-lying marshnear which a large herd of deer lived. Then a man appeared desiring their ruin,harm, and bondage, and he closed off the safe and good path to be traveledjoyfully, and he opened up a false path, and he put out a decoy and set up adummy so that the large herd of deer might later come upon calamity, disaster,and loss. But another man came desiring their good, welfare, and protection, andhe reopened the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully, and he closed offthe false path, and he removed the decoy and destroyed the dummy, so that thelarge herd of deer might later come to growth, increase, and fulfillment.26. “Monks, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning. This is themeaning: ‘The great low-lying marsh’ is a term for sensual pleasures. ‘The largeherd of deer’ is a term for beings. ‘The man desiring their ruin, harm, andbondage’ is a term for Māra the Evil One. ‘The false path’ is a term for thewrong eightfold path, that is: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrongaction, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrongconcentration. ‘The decoy’ is a term for delight and lust. ‘The dummy’ is a termfor ignorance. ‘The man desiring their good, welfare, and protection’ is a termfor the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. ‘The safe andgood path to be traveled joyfully’ is a term for the Noble Eightfold Path, thatis: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood,right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.“So, monks, the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully has been reopened byme, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed.”(from MN 19: Dvedhāvitakka Sutta; I 117–18)(7) THE LION“Monks, in the evening the lion, the king of beasts, comes out from his lair. Hethen stretches himself, surveys the four quarters all around, and roars hislion’s roar three times, after which he sets out in search of game.“When the lion, the king of beasts, roars its lion’s roar, most of the animalsthat hear the sound are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror. Thosewho live in holes enter their holes; those who live in the water enter thewater; those who live in the woods enter the woods; and the birds fly up intothe air. Even those royal bull elephants, bound by strong thongs in thevillages, towns, and capital cities, burst and break their bonds asunder;frightened, they urinate and defecate and flee here and there. So powerful amongthe animals, monks, is the lion, the king of beasts, so majestic and mighty.“So too, monks, when the Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectlyenlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower ofthe world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas andhumans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, he teaches the Dhamma thus: ‘Suchis form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling... such isperception... such are volitional formations... such is consciousness, such itsorigin, such its passing away.’“Then, monks, when those devas who are long-lived, beautiful, abounding inhappiness, dwelling for a long time in lofty palaces, hear the Tathāgata’steaching of the Dhamma, most68[edit_9780861719969_oeb_nts_r1_split_010.html#en262] are filled with fear, asense of urgency, and terror, [saying]: ‘It seems, though we thought ourselvespermanent, that we are impermanent; it seems, though we thought ourselvesstable, that we are unstable; it seems, though we thought ourselves eternal,that we are transient.

The origin of the world has been fully awakened toby the Tathāgata; the Tathāgata has abandoned the origin of the world. Thecessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata; theTathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The way to the cessation ofthe world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata; the Tathāgata hasdeveloped the way to the cessation of the world.“In the world, monks, with its devas, with Māra, with Brahmā, in thispopulation with its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and humans, whateverthere is that is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examinedby the mind, all that has been awakened to by the Tathāgata; therefore he iscalled the Tathāgata.“From the night he fully awakened, monks, until the night he attains finalNibbāna, in this interval, whatever he speaks, talks of, and expounds, all thatis just so, not otherwise; therefore he is called the Tathāgata.“As he speaks, monks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks. Since he does as hespeaks and speaks as he does, therefore he is called the Tathāgata.“In this world, monks, with its devas, with Māra, with Brahmā, in thispopulation with its ascetics and brahmins, with its devas and humans, theTathāgata is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielderof mastery; therefore he is called the Tathāgata.”Having directly known all the world,All in the world exactly as it is,He is detached from all the world,Unengaged with all the world. He indeed is the all-vanquishing sage,The one released from all the knots,Who has reached the supreme state of peace,Nibbāna, without fear from any side. He is the Buddha, with taints destroyed,Untroubled, with all doubts cut off,Who has attained the destruction of all kamma,Liberated in the extinction of acquisitions. He is the Blessed One, the Buddha,He is the lion, unsurpassed,In this world together with its devas,He set in motion the wheel of Brahmā.Thus those devas and human beingsWho have gone for refuge to the Buddha,Having assembled, pay homage to him,The great one free from diffidence. “Tamed, he is supreme among those who tame;At peace, he is the sage among those who bring peace;Freed, he is the chief of those who set free;Delivered, he is the best of those who deliver.” Thus indeed they pay homage to him,The great one free from diffidence.In this world together with its devas,There is no one who can rival you.(AN 4:23; II 23–24 = It 112; 121–23)"},{"pageContent":"NOTESGENERAL INTRODUCTION1 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_itr_r1.html#Ref-en1] The exact years of the Buddha’slife are still a matter of conjecture among scholars. Until recently, the mostcommonly cited figures were 566–486 B.C.E., but in recent years a growing numberof Indologists have come to question these figures and the current preference isto place his death closer to 400 B.C.E.2 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_itr_r1.html#Ref-en2] See, e.g., MN 22.10 (I 133).

The rains retreat (vassāvāsa) is athree-month period coinciding with the Indian rainy season when Buddhist monksmust refrain from wandering and remain at fixed residences. The retreatgenerally lasts from the day after the full-moon day of July until the full-moonday of October.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_itr_r1.html#Ref-en5] See Nyanaponika and Hecker, GreatDisciples of the Buddha, chapter 4.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_itr_r1.html#Ref-en6] In the Theravāda tradition, thewriting down of the canon occurred in Sri Lanka in the first century B.C.E. Atthat time the monks, apprehensive that the orally preserved teachings might belost, collectively inscribed the texts on palm leaves and bound these intovolumes, the prototypes of books. Up to this point, while individual texts mighthave been written down by monks as aids to memory, officially recognizedtranscriptions of the teaching did not exist. On the writing down of the canon,see Adikaram, Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon , p. 79; and Malalasekera, ThePāli Literature of Ceylon, pp. 44–47.

Jetavana, the grove of PrinceJeta, was also known as Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park because it was purchased for theBuddha by the wealthy philanthropist, Anāthapiṇḍika. The Nikāyas depictPasenadi as one of the Buddha’s most devoted lay followers, though they nevershow him as attaining any stage of realization. An entire chapter of theSaṃyutta Nikāya—the Kosalasaṃyutta (chapter 3)—records his conversations withthe Buddha.2 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en12] When speaking of the arahant,the Buddha does not describe his destiny as “aging and death,” but as a merebreaking up and discarding of the body. This is because the arahant, being freefrom all notions of “I” and “mine,” does not conceive the decay and dissolutionof the body as the aging and death of an “I.”3 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en13] Devadūta. According to legend,while the Bodhisatta was still a prince living in the palace, he encountered anold man, a sick man, and a corpse, sights he had never seen before. Theseencounters shattered his worldly complacency and stirred him to seek a way toliberation from suffering. The commentaries say that these three figures weredeities in disguise sent to awaken the Bodhisatta to his mission. Hence old age,illness, and death are called “divine messengers.”4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en14] Yama is the legendary god of theunderworld, who passes judgment on the dead and assigns them to their futuredestiny. According to some accounts, he does so merely by holding before thedead spirits a mirror which reflects back their good and bad deeds.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en15] The underlying tendencies(anusaya) are dispositions toward the defilements that lie dormant in the mindand become active when provoked. Some texts, such as the present one, mentionthree underlying tendencies: the tendency to lust (rāgānusaya) for pleasantfeeling; to aversion (paṭighānusaya) for painful feeling; and to ignorance(avijjānusaya) in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Other textsmention seven underlying tendencies: to sensual lust, aversion, views, doubt,conceit, attachment to existence, and ignorance.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en16] Spk: The escape isconcentration, the path, and the fruit. He does not know this; the only escapehe knows is sensual pleasure.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en17] These five terms constitute amajor pattern for contemplation. “The origin and the passing away” (samudaya,atthaṅgama) point to the characteristic of impermanence. On the triad ofgratification, danger, and escape (assāda, ādīnava, nissaraṇa ), see pp.186–87.8 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en18] The sequel will make it clearthat “the instructed noble disciple” being described here is the arahant, whoalone is entirely free from the tendencies to aversion, lust, and ignorance.However, while the arahant alone may be capable of maintaining perfectequanimity toward physical pain, an ordinary practitioner can still emulate thearahant by attempting to overcome dejection and despondency when experiencingpainful bodily feelings. Everyone with a body, including the Buddha, is subjectto bodily pain. A mark of spiritual maturity is the ability to endure painwithout being overwhelmed by it.9 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en19] The noun paritassanā is derivedfrom the verb paritassati, which represents Skt paritṛṣyati, “to crave, tothirst for”; it is connected etymologically with taṇhā, craving. However, inPāli the verbal stem has become conflated with tasati = to fear, to tremble,and thus its noun derivatives such as paritassanā and paritasita also acquiremeanings derived from tasati. This convergence of meanings, already evident inthe Nikāyas, is made explicit in the commentaries. I have tried to capture bothnuances by rendering the verb paritassati “to be agitated” and the nounparitassanā “agitation.” Though Spk understands paritassanā here in the senseof craving, the text seems to be emphasizing bhaya-paritassanā, “agitation asfear.”10 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c01_r1.html#Ref-en20] The uninstructed worldling isone who lacks both doctrinal knowledge of the Dhamma (underscored by the wordakovida, “unskilled”) and practical training in the Dhamma (underscored byavinīta, “undisciplined”). The worldling is not a “seer of the noble ones,”that is, of the Buddha and the noble disciples, because he or she lacks the eyeof wisdom that discerns the truth they have seen. “Noble ones” (ariya) and“superior persons” (sappurisa) are synonyms.The text here enumerates the twenty types of identity view (sakkāyadiṭṭhi),obtained by positing a self in four ways in relation to the five aggregates thatconstitute personal identity (sakkāya). Identity view is one of the threefetters to be eradicated at stream-entry, the first of the four stages ofrealization.Spk: He regards form as self (rūpaṃ attato samanupassati), by regarding formand the self as indistinguishable, just as the flame of an oil lamp and itscolor are indistinguishable.

Thus, his standing withhis feet (pāda) firmly on the ground was a foretoken of his attaining the fourbases for spiritual power (iddhipāda); his facing the north, of his going aboveand beyond the multitude; his seven steps, of his acquiring the sevenenlightenment factors; the white parasol, of his acquiring the parasol ofliberation; his surveying the quarters, of his acquiring the unobstructedknowledge of omniscience; his uttering the words of the “leader of the herd” (anepithet for an eminent person), of his setting in motion the irreversible wheelof the Dhamma; his statement “This is my last birth,” of his passing away intothe Nibbāna element with no residue remaining (see Text IX,5(5)).9 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en39] This statement seems to be theBuddha’s way of calling attention to the quality he regarded as the true wonderand marvel.10 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en40] In the unabridged version ofthis text, gold and silver are excluded from the things subject to sickness,death, and sorrow, but they are subject to defilement, according to Ps, becausethey can be alloyed with metals of lesser worth.11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en41] Ākiñcaññāyatana. This is thethird formless meditative attainment; preceded by the four jhānas, it is theseventh of the eight attainments (samāpatti) in the scale of concentration.These attainments, though spiritually exalted, are still mundane and, divorcedfrom insight, are not directly conducive to Nibbāna.12 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en42] That is, it leads to rebirth inthe plane of existence called the base of nothingness, the objective counterpartof the seventh meditative attainment. Here the lifespan is said to be 60,000eons, but when that has elapsed one must pass away and return to a lower world.Thus one who attains this is still not free from birth and death.13 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en43] N’eva saññānāsaññāyatana.This is the fourth and highest formless attainment. It should be noted thatUddaka Rāmaputta is Rāma’s son (putta), not Rāma himself. The text gives theimpression that while Rāma had attained the base ofneither-perception-nor-nonperception, Uddaka himself had not done so. Theattainment of this base leads to rebirth in the base ofneither-perception-nor-nonperception, the highest plane of rebirth in saṃsāra.The lifespan there is said to be 84,000 eons, but being conditioned andimpermanent, it is still ultimately unsatisfactory.14 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en44] Text II,3(2) continues fromthis point with an extended account of the Bodhisatta’s extreme asceticpractices followed by his discovery of the middle way.15 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en45] Saccaka was a debater whom, onan earlier occasion, the Buddha had defeated in a discussion. Aggivessana, thename by which the Buddha addresses him just below, is probably his clan name.The present discourse begins with a discussion about pleasant and painfulfeeling, which gives the cue for Saccaka to pose these questions to the Buddha.16 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en46] It is puzzling that in thefollowing paragraphs the Bodhisatta is shown engaging in self-mortificationafter he comes to the conclusion—in this passage—that such practices are uselessfor the attainment of enlightenment. This anomaly raises a suspicion that thenarrative sequence of the sutta has become jumbled. The appropriate place forthe simile of the fire-sticks, it seems, would be at the end of the Bodhisatta’speriod of ascetic experimentation, when he has acquired a sound basis forrejecting self-mortification as a way to enlightenment.17 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en47] This sentence, repeated at theend of each of the following sections as well, answers the second of the twoquestions posed by Saccaka in §11.18 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en48] Ps explains that when theBodhisatta was a child, his father brought him along to attend the ceremonialplowing festival of the Sakyans. The young prince’s attendants left him under arose-apple tree and went to watch the plowing ceremony. Finding himself allalone, the Bodhisatta spontaneously sat up in the meditation posture andattained the first jhāna through mindfulness of breathing. Though the sunmoved, the shade of the tree remained over the Bodhisatta. When the attendantsreturned and found the boy seated in meditation, they reported this to the king,who came and bowed in veneration to his son.19 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en49] This sentence answers the firstof the two questions posed by Saccaka in §11. This passage shows a change in theBodhisatta’s evaluation of pleasure. When pleasure arises from seclusion anddetachment, it is no longer something to be feared and banished by the practiceof austerities but becomes an adjunct of the higher stages along the path toenlightenment.20 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en50] In the usual formula ofdependent origination, consciousness is said to be conditioned by volitionalformations (saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ). This variant reveals the interplayof consciousness and name-and-form to be the “hidden vortex” underlying allexistence within the round of rebirths.21 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en51] Spk: “To this extent one may beborn, age, and die: With consciousness as a condition for name-and-form, andwith name-and-form as a condition for consciousness, to this extent one may beborn and undergo rebirth. What is there beyond this that can be born or undergorebirth? Isn’t it just this that is born and undergoes rebirth?”22 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en52] Note that the Buddha discoversthe path to enlightenment by realizing the cessation of consciousness,name-and-form, and the other links of dependent origination. Cessation isrealized with the experience of Nibbāna, the deathless element.23 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en53] At this point the textintroduces volitional formations. Its principal condition is ignorance, and thusby mentioning its origin, ignorance too is implied. In this way, all twelvefactors of the usual formula of dependent origination are included, at least byimplication.24 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en54] Ālaya. The word signifies boththe objects of clinging and the subjective attitude of clinging.25 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en55] By mentioning these twothemes—dependent origination and Nibbāna—in his reflections immediately afterhis enlightenment, the Buddha underscores their importance for understanding thecontent of his enlightenment. The enlightenment thus involved a comprehension,first, of the dependent origination of suffering, and second, of Nibbāna as thestate of ultimate liberation that transcends all phenomena involved in thedependent origination of suffering. The Buddha first had to comprehend dependentorigination, and only when he had done so could he arrive at the realization ofNibbāna. The “acquisitions” (upadhi) that are relinquished can be understood astwofold: in terms of the object, as the five aggregates or, more broadly, as allobjects of appropriation; and subjectively, as the craving that motivates actsof appropriation.26 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en56] Ps raises the question why,when the Bodhisatta had long ago made an aspiration to attain Buddhahood inorder to liberate others, his mind now inclined toward inaction. The reason, itsays, is that only now, after becoming enlightened, did he recognize howprofound the Dhamma was and how difficult it would be for those with strongdefilements to understand it. Also, he wanted Brahmā to ask him to teach sothat people who venerate Brahmā would respect the Dhamma and wish to hear it.27 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en57] These five monks attended onthe Bodhisatta during his period of self-mortification, convinced that he wouldattain enlightenment and teach them the Dhamma.

Among the criteria he proposes is the opinion of the wise, which shows thatfar from rejecting the opinions of others, the Buddha includes the opinions ofthe right sort of person among the standards for determining proper conduct.Other suttas tell us how we can judge who is truly wise; see Text III,4 and TextIII,5.2. Mp explains that this town was located at the edge of a forest. Variousgroups of wanderers and ascetics would stop there to spend the night beforecrossing the forest. During their stay they would give talks to the Kālāmas,and the Kālāmas were thus exposed to a wide range of philosophical theories.The conflicts between the different views caused them doubt and perplexity.3. The above is a stock passage in the Nikāyas.4. These ten inadequate criteria of truth can be grouped into three classes: (1)The first comprises the first four criteria, all positions based on reverencefor tradition. Of these, (i) “oral tradition” (anussava) refers to the Vedictradition, which, according to the brahmins, had originated with the primaldeity and came down orally through successive generations. (ii) “Lineage”(paramparā) signifies an unbroken succession of teachings or teachers. (iii)“Hearsay” (or “report,” itikirā) may mean popular opinion or general consensus.And (iv) “a collection of texts” (piṭakasampadā) refers to religious textsregarded as infallible. (2) The second set, also made up of four terms, iscomprised of four types of reasoning recognized by thinkers in the Buddha’s age;their differences need not detain us here. (3) The third set, made up of thelast two items, refers to two types of personal authority: (i) the personalcharisma of the speaker (perhaps including his external qualifications, e.g.,that he is highly educated, has a large following, is respected by the king,etc.); and (ii) the speaker’s status as one’s own personal teacher (the Pāliword garu is identical with the Sanskrit guru). For a detailed analysis, seeJayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge , pp. 175–202, 271–75.5. Greed, hatred, and delusion are the three unwholesome roots. The aim of theBuddha’s teaching, Nibbāna, is defined as the destruction of greed (or lust),hatred, and delusion. Thus the Buddha is guiding the Kālāmas toward the heartof his teaching.6. Here the Buddha introduces the four divine abodes (brahmavihāra): boundlessloving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity.7. Mp: Because he does no evil and because no evil (i.e., suffering) will cometo him.8. This is a stock passage. “Going for refuge” is the act by which a new convertacknowledges the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha as guiding ideals. InBuddhist tradition, it has become the procedure by which one formally declaresoneself a Buddhist.9. Gāmaṇi. The word suggests that he is a person of some prominence in thetown.10. Note that the headman here ascribes to the Buddha, as a direct quotation, ageneral statement of the causal relationship between desire and suffering notfound in the Buddha’s words above. The statement is, however, clearly needed asthe referent of “this principle” (iminā dhammena). It is thus possible that thestatement was in the original text but had dropped out in the course of its oraltransmission. Just below the Buddha does make the generalization himself.11. Read, with Be and Ce, ajānantena, as against Ee’s ājānantena. Thenegative is clearly required here, since the monk who cannot directly know theBuddha’s mind must infer from his bodily and verbal behavior that he is fullypurified.12. “States cognizable through the eye” are bodily actions; “states cognizablethrough the ear” are words.13. “Mixed states” would mean the conduct of one who is trying to purify hisbehavior but is unable to do so consistently. Sometimes his conduct is pure,sometimes impure.14. Ps: The dangers are conceit, arrogance, etc. For some monks are calm andhumble as long as they have not become well known and popular; but when theybecome famous and popular, they go about acting improperly, attacking othermonks like a leopard pouncing on a herd of deer.15. Ps: This statement shows the Buddha’s impartiality. He does not extol someand disparage others.16. So tasmiṃ dhamme abhiññāya idh’ekaccaṃ dhammaṃ dhammesu niṭṭhaṃgacchati. In order to convey the intended meaning I have rendered the secondoccurrence of dhamma here as “teaching,” i.e., the particular doctrine taught tohim, the plural dhammesu as “teachings,” and tasmiṃ dhamme as “that Dhamma,” inthe sense of the total teaching. Ps and Ps-pṭ together explain the meaningthus: “When the Dhamma has been taught by the Master, the monk, by directlyknowing the Dhamma through penetration of the path, fruit, and Nibbāna, comesto a conclusion regarding the preliminary teaching of the Dhamma about the aidsto enlightenment (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā).”17. This refers to the faith of a noble person (ariyapuggala), who has seen theDhamma and thus can never acknowledge any teacher other than the Buddha.18. He was a prominent brahmin who ruled over Opasāda, a crown property in thestate of Kosala that had been granted to him by King Pasenadi.19. Apparently this is Kāpaṭhika’s clan name.20. These are the ancient rishis whom the brahmins regarded as the divinelyinspired authors of the Vedic hymns.21. In Pāli: saddhā, ruci, anussava, ākāraparivitakka,diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti. Of these five grounds for arriving at a conviction,the first two seem to be based primarily on emotion, the third to be anunquestioning acceptance of tradition, and the last two primarily rational orcognitive. The last three are included among the ten unacceptable grounds for abelief in Text III,2. The “two different ways” that each may turn out are trueor false.22. It is not proper for him to come to this conclusion because he has notpersonally ascertained the truth of his conviction but only accepts it on aground that is not capable of yielding certainty.23. Saccānurakkhana: or, the safeguarding of truth, the protection of truth.24. Saccānubodha: or, the awakening to truth.25. In this series, “he scrutinizes” (tūleti), according to Ps, means that heinvestigates phenomena as impermanent, suffering, and nonself. This is the stageof insight contemplation. “Applies the will” (ussahati) and “strives” (padahati)appear similar. We might understand the former as the effort leading to insight,the latter as the effort that leads from insight to world-transcendingrealization. This last step is signified by the expression, “he realizes withthe body the supreme truth.” The supreme truth (paramasacca) is Nibbāna.26. While the “discovery of truth” (saccānubodha) in this context seems to meanthe attainment of stream-entry, the final arrival at truth (saccānuppatti) mustmean the attainment of arahantship. Note that the final arrival at truth doesnot come about through any new measures, but simply through the repeateddevelopment of those same factors that led to the discovery of truth.27. Ps: The brahmins believed that they themselves were the offspring ofBrahmā’s mouth, the khattiyas of his breast, the mercantile class (vessa) ofhis belly, the workers (sudda) of his legs, and samaṇas of the soles of hisfeet."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV: THE HAPPINESS VISIBLE IN THIS PRESENT LIFE1 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c04_r1.html#Ref-en68] As the standard for thewheel-turning monarch, Dhamma is not the Buddha’s teaching but the moral law ofjustice and righteousness on the basis of which the righteous king rules hiscountry and gains sovereignty over the world.

In the old canon, the asuras are depicted as titanic beingsengaged in perpetual conflict with the devas but are not assigned to a separaterealm. Since their living conditions, as described in the canon, can hardly becalled unbearably miserable, the commentators identify the asuras thatconstitute the fourth bad destination—not with the asuras who battle against thedevas—but with a class of beings in the realm of afflicted spirits. Needless tosay, the picture of the realms that emerges when the asuras are considereddistinct becomes somewhat blurred: if they are the beings who fight against thedevas, they aren’t depicted as living in abject misery; if they are a class ofbeings in the spirit realm, there seems no reason to treat them as a separaterealm.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c05_r1.html#Ref-en87] I here describe the spheres ofrebirth corresponding to the fourth jhāna in accordance with the cosmology ofscholastic Theravāda Buddhism.

But if a wholesome kamma brings about a human rebirth—and rebirthas a human being is always the result of wholesome kamma—the kamma of killingwill operate in a manner contrary to that of the rebirth-generative kamma bycausing various adversities that may culminate in a premature death.

Ee seems to be mistaken in reading samaya in the two compoundsand ṭhānaṃ instead of aṭṭhānaṃ. Ps cites the Paṭisambhidāmagga for adefinition of asamayavimokkha (lit., non-temporary or “perpetual” emancipation)as the four paths, four fruits, and Nibbāna, and of samayavimokkha (temporaryemancipation) as the four jhānas and four formless attainments. See also MN122.4.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-en121] Ps says that “unshakableliberation of mind” (akuppā cetovimutti) is the fruit of arahantship. Thus“perpetual emancipation”—as including all four paths and fruits—has a widerrange than “unshakable liberation of mind.” The latter alone is declared to bethe goal of the holy life.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-en122] Rāgavirāgatthaṃ.

But it is onlywhen serenity is developed in conjunction with insight that it can give rise tothe noble path, which eradicates the underlying tendency to sensual lust (by thepath of nonreturning) and attachment to existence (by the path of arahantship).Mp interprets serenity here in this second sense, presumably on account of thelast sentence of the sutta.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en135] Mp: It is the wisdom of thesupramundane path (magga-paññā) that is developed.

Mp explains “liberation of mind”(cetovimutti) as the concentration connected with the fruit (of arahantship),“liberation by wisdom” (paññāvimutti) as the wisdom connected with the fruit.Mp is referring to the “meditative attainment of the fruit of arahantship”(arahattaphala-samāpatti ), a supramundane meditative absorption in which thearahant experiences the bliss of Nibbāna.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en137] Samathapubbaṅgamaṃvipassanaṃ.

In this mode of practice, one enters the first jhāna and then,after emerging from it, applies insight to that experience, i.e., one sees thefive aggregates of the jhāna (form, feeling, perception, etc.) as impermanent,bound up with suffering, and nonself. Then one enters the second jhāna andcontemplates it with insight. One applies the same procedure to the otherjhānas as well until the path of stream-entry, etc., is realized.11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en141] Dhammuddhaccaviggahitaṃmānasaṃ hoti. Mp says that “agitation” (uddhacca) arises here as a reaction tothe ten “corruptions of insight” (vipassanūpakkilesa) that one misunderstandsas indicating path-attainment. (On the corruptions of insight, see Vism 633–38;Ppn 20:105–28.) It is possible, however, that the “agitation about the teaching”is mental distress brought on by eagerness to realize the Dhamma. This state ofspiritual anxiety, when suddenly resolved, can sometimes precipitate aninstantaneous experience of awakening. For an example, see the story of BāhiyaDārucīriya at Ud 1:10.12 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en142] Mp explains internal serenityof mind (ajjhattaṃ cetosamatha) as the concentration of full absorption (i.e.,jhāna), and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena(adhipaññādhammavipassanā) as the insight knowledge discerning formations(saṅkhārapariggāhaka-vipassanāñāṇa).13 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en143] “Formations” (saṅkhārā) arethe conditioned phenomena comprised in the five aggregates. On the aggregates,see Texts IX,4(1)(a)–(e).14 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en144] Spk applies the scholasticdistinction of the three types of escape (nissaraṇa) to each hindrance. Oneescapes from the hindrance by suppression (vikkhambhananissaraṇa ) throughjhāna; one escapes in a particular respect (tadaṅganissaraṇa ) throughinsight; and one escapes by eradication (samucchedanissaraṇa) through thesupramundane path. Thus: (1) sensual desire is suppressed by the first jhānabased on the unattractive nature of the body (asubha; see Text VIII,8 §10) anderadicated by the path of arahantship (since kāmacchanda is here interpretedwidely enough to include desire for any object, not only sensual desire); (2)ill will is suppressed by the first jhāna based on loving-kindness anderadicated by the path of nonreturning; (3) dullness and drowsiness aresuppressed by the perception of light (i.e., visualization of a bright light,like the disc of the sun or the full moon) and eradicated by the path ofarahantship; (4) restlessness and remorse are suppressed by serenity, remorse iseradicated by the path of nonreturning and restlessness by the path ofarahantship; and (5) doubt is suppressed by the defining of phenomena(dhammavavatthāna; see Vism 587–89; Ppn 18:3–8) and eradicated by the path ofstream-entry.15 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en145] These are the three “wrongthoughts,” opposite of right thought or right intention, the second factor ofthe Noble Eightfold Path. See Text VII,2.16 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en146] Dhammavitakka. Mp takes thisto refer to the ten “corruptions of insight,” but it seems more natural tounderstand it simply as obsessive reflections about the Dhamma.17 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en147] This refers to the preliminaryconditions for the six direct knowledges (abhiññā), to be described just below.The preliminary condition for the five mundane direct knowledges is the fourthjhāna. The preliminary condition for arahantship, the sixth direct knowledge,is insight. This direct knowledge alone is supramundane.18 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en148] Ps says the higher mind(adhicitta) is the mind of the eight meditative attainments used as a basis forinsight; it is called “higher mind” because it is higher than the ordinary(good) mind of the ten wholesome courses of action. The five “signs” (nimitta)may be understood as practical methods for removing distracting thoughts. Theyshould be resorted to only when the distractions become persistent or obtrusive;at other times the meditator should remain with the primary subject ofmeditation.19 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en149] Ps: When thoughts of sensualdesire arise directed toward living beings, the “other sign” is the meditationon the unattractive nature of the body (see Text VIII,8 §10); when the thoughtsare directed to inanimate things, the “other sign” is attention to impermanence.When thoughts of hate arise directed toward living beings, the “other sign” isthe meditation on loving-kindness; when they are directed to inanimate things,the “other sign” is attention to the elements (see Text VIII,8 §12). The remedyfor thoughts connected with delusion is living under a teacher, studying theDhamma, inquiring into its meaning, listening to the Dhamma, and inquiring intocauses.20 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en150]Vitakka-saṅkhāra-saṇṭhānaṃ. Glossing saṅkhāra here as condition, cause,or root, Ps interprets the compound to mean “stopping the cause of the thought.”This is accomplished by inquiring, when an unwholesome thought has arisen: “Whatis its cause? What is the cause of its cause?” etc. Such an inquiry slows down,and eventually cuts off, the flow of unwholesome thoughts.21 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en151] Tadārammaṇaṃ, lit. “withthat (one) as the object.” Ps: First one develops loving-kindness toward theperson who addresses one with any of the five courses of wrong speech, then onedirects that mind of loving-kindness toward all beings, making the entire worldthe object.22 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en152] Mahānāma was a closerelative of the Buddha, a prominent member of the Sakyan clan.23 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en153] The phrases “arrived at thefruit” (āgataphala) and “understood the teaching” (viññātasāsana) indicatethat he is asking about the meditations of a noble disciple at the minimum levelof stream-enterer. However, such meditations can also be profitably practiced bypeople at any level, for they temporarily cleanse the mind of the defilementsand lead to concentration.24 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en154] I abridge the text, which hereenumerates the different heavenly realms.25 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en155] The Pāli reads ekāyano ayaṃbhikkhave maggo. Almost all translators have understood this statement to be adeclaration that satipaṭṭhāna is an exclusive path. Thus Soma Thera rendersit: “This is the only way, O bhikkhus,” and Nyanaponika Thera: “This is the soleway, monks.” However, at MN 12.37–42 ekāyana magga has the unambiguous meaningof “a path that goes in one way only,” and that seems the meaning that fits besthere as well. The point seems to be simply that satipaṭṭhāna goes in onedirection, toward “the purification of beings... the realization of Nibbāna.”26 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en156] Ps says the repetition“contemplating the body in the body” (kāye kāyānupassī) has the purpose ofprecisely determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that objectfrom others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice, the bodyshould be contemplated as such, and not one’s feelings, ideas, and emotionsconcerning it. The phrase also means that the body should be contemplated simplyas a body and not as a man, a woman, a self, or a living being. Parallelconsiderations apply to the repetitions with regard to each of the other threeestablishments of mindfulness. “Longing and dejection” (abhijjhā-domanassaṃ),according to Ps, imply sensual desire and ill will, the chief among the fivemental hindrances.27 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en157] On the structure of thediscourse to follow, see pp. 262–63.28 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en158] The practice of mindfulness ofbreathing (ānāpānasati) does not involves a deliberate attempt to regulatethe breath, as in hatha yoga, but an effort to fix awareness continuously on thebreath as one breathes at a natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at thenostrils or the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt mostdistinctly. The length of the breath is noted but not consciously controlled.The complete development of this meditation subject is explained in Text VIII,9.A detailed explanation of mindfulness of breathing according to the commentarialsystem is at Vism 266–93; Ppn 8:145–244. See too the collection of textstranslated by Ñāṇamoli, Mindfulness of Breathing.29 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en159] Ps, in line with other Pālicommentaries, explains “experiencing the whole body” (sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī)to mean that the meditator becomes aware of each in-breath and out-breaththrough its three phases of beginning, middle, and end. This interpretation isdifficult to square with the literal words of the original text, which may haveoriginally intended simply a global awareness of the entire body. It is alsodifficult to see how -paṭisaṃvedī could mean “is aware of”; this suffix isbased on the verb paṭisaṃvedeti meaning “to experience” or “to feel,” whichhas a different nuance from “awareness.”30 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en160] The “bodily formation”(kāyasaṅkhāra) is defined as in-and-out breathing at MN 44.13 (I 301) and SN41:6 (IV 293). Thus, as Ps explains, with the successful development of thispractice, the meditator’s breathing becomes increasingly more quiet, tranquil,and peaceful.31 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en161] Ps: “Internally”:contemplating the breathing in his own body. “Externally”: contemplating thebreathing taking place in the body of another. “Internally and externally”:contemplating the breathing in his own body and in the body of anotheralternately, with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to therefrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under thecontemplation of feeling, mind, and phenomena, the contemplation externally,apart from those possessing telepathic powers, must be inferential. It is alsoimpossible for those without telepathic powers to directly contemplate thebreathing of another, apart from observation of the expansion and contraction ofthe chest, so contemplation in this case too must be inferential.32 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en162] Ps explains that the arisingnature (samudayadhamma) of the body can be observed in its conditionedorigination through ignorance, craving, kamma, and food, as well as in themoment-by-moment origination of material phenomena in the body. In the case ofmindfulness of breathing, an additional condition is the physiological apparatusof respiration. The “vanishing nature” (vayadhamma) of the body is seen in thecessation of bodily phenomena through the cessation of their conditions as wellas in the momentary dissolution of bodily phenomena.33 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en163] The understanding of thebodily postures referred to in this exercise is not our normal knowledge of ourbodily activity, but a close, constant, and careful awareness of the body inevery position, coupled with an analytical examination intended to dispel thedelusion of a self as the agent of bodily movement.34 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en164] Sampajañña, clearcomprehension, is analyzed in the commentaries into four types: (1) clearcomprehension of the purpose of one’s action; (2) clear comprehension of thesuitability of one’s means to the achievement of one’s purpose; (3) clearcomprehension of the domain, that is, not abandoning the subject of meditationduring one’s daily routine; and (4) clear comprehension of reality, theawareness that behind one’s activities there is no abiding self. See Soma, TheWay of Mindfulness, pp. 60–100; Nyanaponika, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation,pp. 46–55.35 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en165] A detailed explanation of thispractice, according to the commentarial method, is at Vism 239–266; Ppn8:42–144. The mesentery is a fold of tissue that anchors the small intestine tothe back of the abdominal wall.36 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en166] These four elements are theprimary attributes of matter—the earth element (pathavīdhātu) is solidity; thewater element (āpodhātu), cohesion; the fire element (tejodhātu), heat; andthe air element (vāyodhātu), pressure or distension. For a more detailedaccount of the contemplation of elements, see Text IX,4(3)(c). For thecommentarial explanation, see Vism 347–72; Ppn 11:27–126.37 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en167] The phrase “as though”(seyyathāpi) suggests that this meditation, and those to follow, need not bebased upon actual observation of a decaying corpse but can be performedimaginatively. “This same body” is, of course, the meditator’s own body.38 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en168] Each of the four types ofcorpse mentioned here, and the three types below, may be taken as a separate andself-sufficient subject of meditation; or the entire set may be used as aprogressive series for impressing on the mind the idea of the body’s transienceand insubstantiality. The progression continues in §§26–30.39 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en169] Feeling (vedanā) signifiesthe affective quality of experience, bodily and mental, either pleasant,painful, or neither, i.e., neutral feeling. Examples of the “carnal” and“spiritual” varieties of these feelings are given at MN 137.9–15 (III 217–19)under the rubric of the six kinds of joy, grief, and equanimity basedrespectively on the household life and renunciation.40 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en170] The conditions for the arisingand vanishing of feeling are the same as those for the body (see p. 442 (chapterVIII, n. 32) except that food is replaced by contact, since contact is thecondition for feeling).41 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en171] Mind (citta) as an object ofcontemplation refers to the general state and level of consciousness. Sinceconsciousness itself is the bare knowing or cognizing of an object, the qualityof any state of mind is determined by its associated mental factors, such aslust, hate, and delusion or their opposites.42 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en172] The examples of citta given inthis passage contrast states of mind of wholesome and unwholesome, or developedand undeveloped character. The pair “contracted” and “distracted,” however,consists of unwholesome opposites, the former due to dullness and drowsiness,the latter to restlessness and remorse. Ps explains “exalted mind” and“unsurpassable mind” as the mind pertaining to the meditative attainments(jhānas and formless states), “unexalted mind” and “surpassable mind” as themind pertaining to sense-sphere consciousness. The commentary says “liberatedmind” should be understood as a mind temporarily and partly freed fromdefilements through insight or the jhānas. Since the practice ofsatipaṭṭhāna pertains to the preliminary phase of the path, the commentaryholds that this last category should not be understood as a mind liberated byattainment of the supramundane paths; perhaps, however, this interpretationshould not be excluded.43 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en173] The conditions for the arisingand vanishing of mind are the same as those for the body except that food isreplaced by name-and-form, the condition for consciousness.44 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en174] The five hindrances (pañcanīvaraṇā): the main inner impediments to the development of concentration andinsight.

This tetrad deals entirely withinsight, unlike the other three, which can be interpreted by way of bothserenity and insight.“Contemplating fading away” (virāgānupassī) and “contemplating cessation”(nirodhānupassī) can be understood both as the insight into the momentarydestruction and cessation of phenomena and as the supramundane path, whichrealizes Nibbāna as the fading away of lust (virāga, dispassion) and thecessation of formations. “Contemplating relinquishment” (paṭinissaggānupassī) is giving up (pariccāga) or abandoning (pahāna) defilements through insightand entering into (pakkhandana) Nibbāna by attainment of the path.58 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en188] Spk: Attention is not actuallyfeeling, but this is a heading of the teaching. In this tetrad, in the firstphrase feeling is spoken of indirectly under the heading of rapture (which isnot a feeling), in the second phrase it is referred to directly as happiness (=pleasant feeling). In the third and fourth phrases, feeling is included in themental formation.59 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en189] Spk: Having seen with wisdom,etc. Here, “longing” is just the hindrance of sensual desire; by “dejection” thehindrance of ill will is shown. This tetrad is stated by way of insight only.These two hindrances are the first among the five hindrances, the first sectionin the contemplation of mental phenomena. Thus he says this to show thebeginning of the contemplation of mental phenomena. By “abandoning” is meant theknowledge that effects abandoning, e.g., one abandons the perception ofpermanence by contemplation of impermanence. By the words “having seen withwisdom” he shows the succession of insights thus: “With one insight knowledge(he sees) the knowledge of abandonment consisting in the knowledges ofimpermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment; and that too (he sees)by still another.” He is one who looks on closely with equanimity: one is saidto look on with equanimity (at the mind) that has fared along the path [Spk-pṭ:by neither exerting nor restraining the mind of meditative development that hasproperly fared along the middle way], and by the presentation as a unity[Spk-pṭ: since there is nothing further to be done in that respect when themind has reached one-pointedness].

At SN 46:5, they are explained as the factorsthat lead to enlightenment.

AtSN 46:2 (V 66), the “nutriment” for the arising of this factor of enlightenmentis said to be frequently giving careful attention to wholesome and unwholesomemental phenomena, blamable and blameless states, inferior and superior states,dark and bright states with their counterparts. Although this factor ofenlightenment is identified with paññā or wisdom, the above passage suggeststhat its initial function is to discriminate between the good and bad mentalphenomena that become apparent with the deepening of mindfulness.62 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c08_r1.html#Ref-en192] Sāriputta was one of theBuddha’s two chief disciples, the one who excelled in wisdom.

For a detailed discussion according to thecommentarial system, see Vism 702–9; Ppn 23:16–52."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX: SHINING THE LIGHT OF WISDOM1. Unfortunately, the connection between the noun and the verb, so obvious inthe Pāli, is lost when paññā is translated as “wisdom” and the verb rendered“one understands.” To avoid this, other translators have preferred renderingsfor paññā that preserve a visible connection between the noun and the verb, forexample, “understanding” (Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli) or “discernment” (ThānissaroBhikkhu).2. E.g., at SN 22:5, 35:99, 35:160, 56:1.3. This correlation is commonly made in the commentaries when they comment onthis formula.4. The commentarial interpretation, detailed and highly technical, is found inVism, chapter 17.5. In the Pāli commentaries, these two elements of Nibbāna are calledrespectively kilesa-parinibbāna, the extinction of defilements, andkhandha-parinibbāna, the extinction of the aggregates.6. The two words are actually derived from different verbal roots. Nibbuta ispast participle of nir + vṛ; which has a corresponding noun nibbuti, used as asynonym for Nibbāna. Nibbāna is from nir + vā.7. For an amplification of the ocean simile, see SN 44:1.8. Pātimokkha: the code of training rules governing the conduct of a fullyordained monk.9. Ps: Right view is twofold: mundane (lokiya) and supramundane (lokuttara).Mundane right view is again twofold: the view that kamma produces its fruits,which may be held both by Buddhists and non-Buddhists, and the view inconformity with the Four Noble Truths, which is exclusive to the Buddha’steaching. Supramundane right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truthsattained by penetrating to the four paths and fruits (see p. 373). The questionposed by Sāriputta concerns the sekha, the disciple in higher training.10. These are the ten courses of unwholesome action. For a more detailedexplanation, see Text V,1(2). Their opposites, just below, are the ten coursesof wholesome action, also elaborated in the same text.11. Ps explains the disciple’s understanding of these four terms by way of theFour Noble Truths thus: all the courses of action (unwholesome and wholesome)are the truth of suffering; the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth ofthe origin; the non-occurrence of both actions and their roots is the truth ofcessation; and the noble path that realizes cessation is the truth of the path.To this extent a noble disciple at one of the first three planes has beendescribed—one who has arrived at supramundane right view but has not yeteliminated all defilements.12. Ps says that the passage from “he entirely abandons the underlying tendencyto lust” until “he makes an end of suffering” shows the work accomplished by thepaths of the nonreturner and arahantship. The path of the nonreturner eliminatesthe underlying tendencies to sensual lust and aversion; the path of arahantshipremoves the underlying tendency to the view and conceit “I am.” Ps says theexpression “underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’” (asmī tidiṭṭhimānānusaya) should be interpreted to mean the underlying tendency toconceit that is similar to a view because, like the view of self, it occursgrasping the notion “I am.”13. Nutriment (āhāra) is to be understood here in a broad sense as a prominentcondition for the individual life-process. Physical food is an importantcondition for the physical body, contact for feeling, mental volition forconsciousness, and consciousness for name-and-form, the psychophysical organismin its totality. Craving is called the origin of nutriment since the craving ofthe previous existence is the source of the present individuality with itsdependence upon and continual consumption of the four nutriments in thisexistence. For an annotated compilation of canonical and commentarial texts onthe nutriments, see Nyanaponika Thera, The Vision of Dhamma, pp. 211–28.14. The next twelve sections present, in reverse order, a factor-by-factorexamination of dependent origination. See too Texts IX, 4(4)(a)–(f).15. The three kinds of existence (bhava): on the three realms of existence, seepp. 149–50. In the formula of dependent origination, “existence” signifies boththe planes of rebirth and the types of kamma that produce rebirth into thoseplanes. The former is known technically as upapattibhava, “rebirth-existence,”the latter as kammabhava, “karmically active existence.”16. Clinging to rules and observances (sīlabbatupādāna) is the adherence tothe view that purification can be achieved by adopting certain external rules orfollowing certain observances, particularly of ascetic self-discipline; clingingto a doctrine of self (attavādupādāna) is holding one or another of the viewsof self that originate from identity view (see particularly the BrahmajālaSutta, DN 1); clinging to views (diṭṭhupādāna) is the clinging to any otherview (than one of the two enumerated separately). Clinging in any of itsvarieties is a strengthening of craving, its condition.17. Craving for phenomena (dhammataṇhā) is the craving for all objects ofconsciousness except the objects of the five classes of sense consciousness.Examples would be the craving associated with fantasies and mental imagery, withabstract ideas and intellectual gratification, and so forth.18. Contact (phassa) is the coming together (saṅgati) of internal sense base(sense faculty), external sense base (object), and consciousness.19. The term nāmarūpa was of pre-Buddhistic origins. It was used in theUpaniṣads to represent the differentiated manifestation of brahman, the nondualabsolute reality appearing in the guise of multiplicity. Brahman apprehended bythe senses as diversified appearances is form (rūpa); brahman apprehended bythought through diversified names or concepts is name (nāma). The Buddhaadopted this expression and gave it a meaning governed by his own system. Herename and form become, respectively, the cognitive and physical sides ofindividual existence.In the Buddha’s system, rūpa is defined as the four great elements and the formderived from them. Form is both internal to the person (= the body with itssenses) and external (= the physical world). The Nikāyas do not explain derivedform (upādāya rūpa), but the Abhidhamma analyzes it into twenty-four kinds ofsecondary material phenomena, which include the sensitive matter of the fivesense faculties and four of the five sense objects (the tactile object isidentified with three of the great elements—earth, heat, and air—which eachexhibit tangible properties).Though I render nāma as name, this should not be taken too literally. Nāma isthe assemblage of mental factors involved in cognition: feeling, perception,volition, contact, and attention (vedanā, saññā, cetanā, phassa,manasikāra). These are probably called “name” because they contribute to theconceptual designation of objects. It should be noted that in the Nikāyas,nāmarūpa does not include consciousness (viññāṇa). Consciousness is thecondition for nāmarūpa, just as the latter is the condition for consciousness,so that the two are mutually dependent (see Text II,3(3)).20. Mind-consciousness (manoviññāṇa) comprises all consciousness except thefive types of sense consciousness just mentioned. It includes consciousness ofmental images, abstract ideas, and internal states of mind, as well as theconsciousness that reflects upon sense objects.21. In the context of the doctrine of dependent origination, volitionalformations (saṅkhārā) are wholesome and unwholesome volitions. The bodilyformation is volition expressed through the body; the verbal formation, volitionexpressed by speech; and the mental formation, volition that does not reachbodily or verbal expression.22. It should be noted that while ignorance is a condition for the taints, thetaints—including the taint of ignorance—are in turn a condition for ignorance.Ps says that this conditioning of ignorance by ignorance implies that theignorance in any one existence is conditioned by the ignorance in the precedingexistence. Since this is so, the conclusion follows that no first point can bediscovered for ignorance, and thus that saṃsāra is without discerniblebeginning.23. The “four phases” (or “four turnings,” catuparivaṭṭa) are: aggregate,origin, cessation, and the way to cessation, as applied to each of the fiveaggregates.24. This passage describes the trainees (sekha). They have directly known theFour Noble Truths and are practicing for the ultimate cessation of the fiveaggregates, that is, for Nibbāna.25. This passage describes the arahants. According to DN II 63–64, the round ofexistence turns as a basis for manifestation and designation only in so far asthere is consciousness together with name-and-form; when both consciousness andname-and-form cease, there is no round to serve as a basis for manifestation anddesignation.26. Cha cetanākāyā. The fact that there is a difference between the name ofthe aggregate, saṅkhārakkhandha, and the term of definition, cetanā, suggeststhat this aggregate has a wider range than the others. In the Abhidhamma and thecommentaries, it is treated as an “umbrella category” for classifying all themental factors mentioned in the suttas apart from feeling and perception.Volition is mentioned in the definition because it is the most important factorin this aggregate, not because it is its exclusive constituent.27. It is significant that while contact is the condition for the arising of thethree aggregates of feeling, perception, and volitional formations,name-and-form is the condition for the arising of consciousness. This supportsthe statement in the ten-factored formula of dependent origination, found inText II,3(3), that name-and-form is the condition for consciousness.28. According to Spk, desire (chanda) here is synonymous with craving (taṇhā).This is said because the five aggregates in any given existence originate fromthe residual craving for new existence of the immediately preceding existence.29. Clinging is not the same as the “five aggregates subject to clinging”because the aggregates are not reducible to clinging. Yet clinging is notsomething apart from the “five aggregates subject to clinging” because there isno clinging that does not have the aggregates as its support and object.30. On “I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit,” see p.445 (chapter IX, n.63).31. This is the second discourse of the Buddha, according to the narrative ofthe Buddha’s teaching career at Vin I 13–14. The five bhikkhus are the firstfive disciples, who at this point are still trainees (sekha). The Buddha’spurpose in teaching this discourse is to lead them to arahantship.32. The sutta offers two “arguments” for the thesis of nonself. The firstcontends that the aggregates are nonself on the ground that we cannot exercisemastery over them. Since we cannot bend the aggregates to our will, they are all“subject to affliction” and therefore cannot be considered our self. The secondargument, introduced just below, posits the characteristic of nonself on thebasis of the other two characteristics. Whatever is impermanent is in some waybound up with suffering; whatever is impermanent and bound up with sufferingcannot be identified as our self.33. Spk explains at length how form (i.e., the body) is like a lump of foam(pheṇapiṇḍa). I give merely the highlights: As a lump of foam lacks anysubstance (sāra), so form lacks any substance that is permanent, stable, aself; as the lump of foam is full of holes and fissures and the abode of manycreatures, so too form; as the lump of foam, after expanding, breaks up, so doesform, which is pulverized in the mouth of death.34. Spk: A bubble (bubbuḷa) is feeble and cannot be grasped, for it breaks upas soon as it is seized; so too feeling is feeble and cannot be grasped aspermanent and stable. As a bubble arises and ceases in a drop of water and doesnot last long, so too with feeling: billions of feelings arise and cease in thetime of a fingersnap. As a bubble arises in dependence on conditions, so feelingarises in dependence on a sense base, an object, the defilements, and contact.35. Spk: Perception is like a mirage (marīcikā) in the sense that it isinsubstantial, for one cannot grasp a mirage to drink or bathe or fill apitcher. As a mirage deceives the multitude, so does perception, which enticespeople with the idea that the colorful object is beautiful, pleasurable, andpermanent.36. Spk: As a banana trunk (kadalikkhandha) is an assemblage of many sheaths,each with its own characteristic, so the aggregate of volitional formations isan assemblage of many phenomena, each with its own characteristic.37. Spk: Consciousness is like a magical illusion (māyā) in the sense that itis insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Consciousness is even more transient andfleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a personcomes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is differentin each of these activities. Consciousness deceives the multitude like a magicalillusion.38. This sutta, sometimes called “The Fire Sermon,” is the third discourserecorded in the narrative of the Buddha’s ministry, at Vin I 34–35. According tothis source, the thousand monks to whom the sutta was addressed had formerlybeen fire-worshipping ascetics, and thus the Buddha used this theme because itcorresponded with their background. For an account of how the Buddha convertedthem, see Ñāṇamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 54–60, 64–69.39. The Buddha is speaking to Pukkusāti, a monk who had gone forth out of faithin the Buddha without ever having seen him before. When the sutta opens, theBuddha arrives at a potter’s shed, intending to spend the night there.Pukkusāti has already been lodging in the shed and greets the Buddha in afriendly way, unaware that this is his master. Without revealing his identity toPukkusāti, the Buddha initiates a conversation, which turns into a discourse onthe development of wisdom.40. Ps: This is the sixth element, which “remains” in that it has yet to beexpounded by the Buddha and penetrated by Pukkusāti. Here it is explained asthe consciousness that accomplishes the work of insight contemplation on theelements. Under the heading of consciousness, the contemplation of feeling isalso introduced.41. This passage shows the conditionality of feeling and its impermanencethrough the cessation of its condition.42. Idappaccayatā. The word is a compound of idaṃ, this, with paccaya,condition, augmented by the abstract noun termination–tā.This is a synonym forpaṭiccasamuppāda . See Text II,4 §19, which likewise connects the realizationof dependent origination with the Buddha’s enlightenment.43. Spk: Actuality (tathatā) means the occurrence of each particular phenomenonwhen its assemblage of appropriate conditions is present. Inerrancy (avitathatā) means that once its conditions have reached completeness there is nonon-occurrence, even for a moment, of the phenomenon due to be produced fromthose conditions. Invariability (anaññathatā) means that there is no productionof one phenomenon by another’s conditions.44. Dhamme ñāṇa. This is the direct knowledge of the Four Noble Truths arisenthrough penetration of Nibbāna as the truth of cessation.45. Anvaye ñāṇa. This is an inference extending to the past and the future,based on the immediate discernment of the conditional relationship obtainingbetween any pair of factors.46. Spk: The idea of existence (atthitā) is eternalism (sassata); the idea ofnonexistence (natthitā) is annihilationism (uccheda). Spk-pṭ: The idea ofexistence is eternalism because it maintains that the entire world (of personalexistence) exists forever. The notion of nonexistence is annihilationism becauseit maintains that the entire world does not exist (forever) but is cut off.In view of these explanations it would be misleading to translate the two terms,atthitā and natthitā, simply as “existence” and “nonexistence.” In the presentpassage atthitā and natthitā are abstract nouns formed from the verbs atthiand natthi. It is thus the metaphysical assumptions implicit in suchabstractions that are at fault, not the ascriptions of existence andnonexistence themselves. I have tried to convey this sense of metaphysicalabstraction, conveyed in Pāli by the termination -tā, by rendering the twoterms “the idea of existence” and “the idea of nonexistence,” respectively.Unfortunately, atthitā and bhava both had to be rendered by “existence,” whichobscures the fact that in Pāli they are derived from different roots. Whileatthitā is the notion of existence in the abstract, bhava is concreteindividual existence in one or another of the three realms. For the sake ofmarking the difference, bhava might have been rendered “being,” but this Englishword is too likely to suggest “Being,” the absolute object of philosophicalspeculation. It does not sufficiently convey the sense of concreteness intrinsicto bhava.47. Spk: The origin of the world: the production of the world of formations.There is no idea of nonexistence in regard to the world: there does not occur inhim the annihilationist view that might arise in regard to phenomena producedand made manifest in the world of formations, holding “They do not exist.”Spk-pṭ: The annihilationist view might arise in regard to the world offormations thus: “On account of the annihilation and perishing of beings rightwhere they are, there is no persisting being or phenomenon.” It also includesthe wrong view, having those formations as its object, that holds: “There are nobeings who are reborn.” That view does not occur in him; for one seeing withright understanding the production and origination of the world of formations independence on such diverse conditions as kamma, ignorance, craving, etc., thatannihilationist view does not occur, since one sees the uninterrupted productionof formations.Spk: The cessation of the world: the dissolution of formations. There is no ideaof existence in regard to the world: There does not occur in him the eternalistview that might arise in regard to phenomena produced and made manifest in theworld of formations, holding “They exist.” Spk-pṭ: The eternalist view mightarise in regard to the world of formations, taking it to exist at all times,owing to the apprehension of identity in the uninterrupted continuum occurringin a cause-effect relationship. But that view does not occur in him; because hesees the cessation of the successively arisen phenomena and the arising ofsuccessively new phenomena, the eternalist view does not occur.Spk: Further, “the origin of the world” is direct-order conditionality(anulomapaccayākāra ); “the cessation of the world” is reverse-orderconditionality (paṭiloma-paccayākāra). [Spk-pṭ: “Direct-orderconditionality” is the conditioning efficiency of the conditions in relation totheir own effects; “reverse-order conditionality” is the cessation of theeffects through the cessation of their respective causes.] For in seeing thedependency of the world, when one sees the continuation of the conditionallyarisen phenomena owing to the continuation of their conditions, theannihilationist view, which might otherwise have arisen, does not occur. And inseeing the cessation of conditions, when one sees the cessation of theconditionally arisen phenomena owing to the cessation of their conditions, theeternalist view, which might otherwise have arisen, does not occur.48. Spk explains dukkha here as “the mere five aggregates subject to clinging”(pañc’upādānakkhandhamattam eva). Thus what the noble disciple sees, when hereflects upon his personal existence, is not a self or a substantially existentperson but a mere assemblage of conditioned phenomena arising and passing awaythrough the conditioning process of dependent origination.49. I interpret what one intends (ceteti) and what one plans (pakappeti) here asrepresenting volitional formations (saṅkhārā), the second factor in theformula of dependent origination. Whatever one has a tendency toward (anuseti)implies the underlying tendencies (anusaya), primarily the tendencies towardignorance and craving, hence the first and eighth factors in the formula. Whenone passes away with the tendencies toward ignorance and craving still intact,one’s intentions and plans—the concrete manifestations of craving in the form ofvolitional activities—become the basis for consciousness to continue on, becomeestablished in a fresh “name-and-form,” and initiate the production of a newexistence. This is the event of birth, followed by aging, death, and the othertypes of suffering between birth and death.50. Although it is not possible to have the underlying tendencies withoutintentions and plans, this passage might be seen to have the rhetorical purposeof emphasizing the role of the underlying tendencies in sustaining the processof rebirth. But according to Spk, the passage is intended to show that for aninsight meditator who has overcome unwholesome thoughts, the danger of rebirthstill exists as long as the underlying tendencies remain intact.51. This paragraph shows the arahant.52. Tathāni avitathāni anaññathāni. See pp. 449–50, note 43. Spk: ”Actual inthe sense of not departing from the real nature of things; for suffering isstated to be just suffering. Unerring, because of not falsifying its realnature; for suffering does not become nonsuffering. Invariable, because of notarriving at a different nature; for suffering does not arrive at the nature ofthe origin (of suffering), etc. The same method for the other truths.” Iunderstand anaññatha in the simpler and more straightforward sense that thetruths are “invariable” because they never vary from the way things really are.53. Bhavanetti. That which leads to new existence, i.e., craving for existence.54. All these leaves are small and delicate. The leaves mentioned in thecounterpart passage below are broad and sturdy.55. Spk identifies him as Sāriputta’s nephew.56. Nippapañcaṃ. Spk: Because it is not proliferated (elaborated) by craving,conceit, and views.57. The negation of the physical elements can be taken to deny, not only thepresence of matter in Nibbāna, but also the identification of Nibbāna with theexperiences of the jhānas, which still pertain to the realm of form. Thefollowing four items negate the objects of the four formless meditativeattainments in Nibbāna.58. In Pāli, diṭṭha, “seen,” is here clearly intended as an antithesis todiṭṭhi, “view.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X: THE PLANES OF REALIZATION1 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en195] The terminology of “path” and“fruition” is a commentarial way of drawing the distinction. The suttasthemselves do not use the scheme of four “paths” but speak only of one path, theNoble Eightfold Path that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is alsocalled the arahattamagga, the path to arahantship, but in a broad sense, as thepath to the highest goal, not in the narrow sense of the path preceding thefruit of arahantship. However, the suttas do make a distinction between theperson practicing for the attainment of a particular fruit(phala-sacchikiriyāya paṭipanna) and the person who has attained the stagethat results from this practice (see Text X,1(1)). Based on this distinction,the commentarial terminology of path and fruit is useful as a concise way ofreferring to the two phases of the Nikāya scheme.2 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en196] My explanation of theonce-returner’s attenuation of lust, hatred, and defilements is based on thecommentaries. Apart from the standard formula, the suttas themselves say verylittle about the once-returner.3 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en197] It is also important to notethat the suttas imply that the dhammānusārī and saddhānusārī remain thusfor an extended period of time. The position of the suttas seems to contradictthe commentarial idea that a path-attainer is such only for a singlemind-moment. If the latter were the case, this would mean that a dhammānusārīand saddhānusārī are such for only a single mind-moment, and this seems hardto square with sutta statements to the effect that they receive gifts, resort tolodgings in the forest, etc.4 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en198] The commentarial method ofexplanation stipulates that the meditator emerges from the jhāna attainment andpractices insight contemplation with a mind made sharp and supple by the jhāna.However, the suttas themselves say nothing about emerging from the jhāna. Ifone reads the suttas alone, without the commentaries, it seems as if themeditator examines the factors within the jhāna itself.5 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en199] As the arahants have achievedliberation from the round of existence, it is impossible to point to any placewithin the round where they might appear; hence they have no future round formanifestation.6 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en200] The “five lower fetters” (pañc’orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni) are: identity view, doubt, grasping of rules andobservances, sensual lust, and ill will. Those who are spontaneously reborn(opapātika) take rebirth without dependence on a mother and father.7 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en201] The “three fetters” are thefirst three of the five fetters, just above. “Fixed in destiny” (niyata) meansthat the stream-enterer is bound to reach liberation in at most seven more livespassed either in the human world or in celestial realms. Enlightenment(sambodhi) is the arahant’s full and final knowledge of the Four Noble Truths.8 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en202] On the distinction betweenthese two types, see below, Text X,1(5) §§20–21 and Text X,2(2).9 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en203] Ps says that this refers topersons devoted to the practice of insight who have not reached any supramundanerealization but possess strong conviction in the truth of the Dhamma. The wordssaddhāmattaṃ pemamattaṃ might have been translated “mere faith, mere love,”but such qualities could not guarantee a rebirth in heaven. It thus seemsnecessary to take the suffix–matta as implying a sufficient amount of thesequalities, not simply their mere existence.10 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en204] The Buddha is here speakingwith the wanderer Vacchagotta (see Text IX,5(6)). Ps says that Vacchagottathought the Buddha may have been the only one within his community to haveattained the final goal.11 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en205] This question and the one in§11 concern the nonreturner. Note that nonreturners observe celibacy.12 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en206] This question and the one in§12 concern stream-enterers and once-returners. Since they are described asenjoying sensual pleasures, this means that they are not obliged to observecelibacy.13 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en207] Ubhatobhāgavimutta. Ps: He isliberated in both ways because he is liberated from the form body by theformless attainments and from the mental body by the path of arahantship. Thedual liberation of the “both-ways-liberated” arahant should not be confused withthe “taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom” (anāsavā cetovimuttipaññāvimutti), which is shared by all arahants, regardless of whether or notthey attain the formless attainments.14 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en208] Paññāvimutta. Ps says thisincludes those who attain any of the four jhānas as well as the dry-insightarahant. A dry-insight arahant is not explicitly recognized in the Nikāyas.15 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en209] Kāyasakkhī. This includesall those from persons on the path to arahantship down to stream-enterers whoattain the formless attainments.16 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en210] Diṭṭhippatta. This includesthe same classes who do not attain the formless attainments and in whom wisdomis the dominant faculty.17 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en211] Saddhāvimutta. This includesthe same classes in whom faith is the dominant faculty.18 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en212] Dhammānusārī. This type andthe next, the saddhānusārī, are the two kinds of persons practicing forrealization of the fruit of stream-entry. See p. 375 and Text X,2(2).19 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en213] Sammattaniyāma: thesupramundane Noble Eightfold Path.20 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en214] Contrary to the commentaries,which hold that the path-attainer realizes the fruit immediately after attainingthe path, the Nikāyas say merely that one who reaches the stage ofDhamma-follower or faith-follower (corresponding to the commentarial notion ofpath-attainer) will realize the fruit within this same life—but not necessarilyin the next mind-moment. The two positions might be reconciled if we see thepath of the Dhamma-follower and faith-follower as extended in time but reachingits climax in an instantaneous breakthrough that is immediately followed byrealization of the fruit.21 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en215] This statement makes it clearhow the stream-enterer differs from those on the path to stream-entry. Thefaith-follower accepts the teaching on trust (with a limited degree ofunderstanding), the Dhamma-follower accepts it through investigation (with agreater degree of understanding); but the stream-enterer has directly known andseen the teaching.22 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en216] The breakthrough to the Dhamma(dhammābhisamaya) and the gaining of the vision of the Dhamma(dhammacakkhupaṭilābha) are synonyms signifying the attainment ofstream-entry.23 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en217] Aveccappasāda. Spk explainsthis as unshakable confidence gained through what has been attained, namely,stream-entry.24 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en218] The hells, the animal realm,and the sphere of afflicted spirits are themselves the plane of misery, the baddestinations, and the lower world.25 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en219] Identity (sakkāya) is thecomposite of the five aggregates that we identify as our “self.” The cessationof identity is Nibbāna.26 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en220] Upadhi. In the presentcontext, this word seems to mean material possessions.27 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en221] Of these eleven attributes,“impermanent” and “disintegrating” illustrate the characteristic ofimpermanence; “alien,” “empty,” and “nonself,” the characteristic of nonself;the other six, the characteristic of suffering.28 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en222] Ps: He turns his mind awayfrom the five aggregates included within the jhāna, which he has seen to bemarked with the three characteristics. The “deathless element” (amatadhātu) isNibbāna. First, he “directs his mind to it” with the insight consciousness,having heard it praised as “peaceful and sublime,” and so forth. Then, with thesupramundane path, he “directs his mind to it” by making it an object andpenetrating it as “peaceful and sublime,” and so forth.29 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en223] Dhammarāgena dhammanandiyā.It seems that this desire for the Dhamma and delight in the Dhamma do two thingssimultaneously: (1) because they are directed toward the Dhamma, they propel thedisciple to the destruction of the five lower fetters; (2) because they arestill desire and delight, they prevent the attainment of arahantship.30 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en224] Here, in the formlessattainments, the sutta mentions only the four mental aggregates. The aggregateof form is excluded.31 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en225] These are meditation subjectsthat lead to disenchantment and dispassion. The unattractiveness of the body isat Text VIII,8 §10; the reflection on the repulsiveness of food is explained atVism 341–47 (Ppn 11:1–26); the perception of death, at Vism 229–39 (Ppn 8:1–41);and the perception of discontent with the entire world, and the contemplation ofimpermanence in all formations, at AN 10:60; V 111.32 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en226] At AN V 110, the perception ofabandonment (pahānasaññā) is explained as the removal of defiled thoughts. AtAN V 110–11, the perception of dispassion (virāgasaññā) and the perception ofcessation (virāgasaññā) are both explained as reflections on the attributes ofNibbāna.33 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en227] Spk explains theantarāparinibbāyī (“one who attains Nibbāna in the interval”) as one rebornin the pure abodes who attains arahantship during the first half of thelifespan. This type is subdivided into three, depending on whether arahantshipis reached: (1) on the very day of rebirth; (2) after one or two hundred eonshave elapsed; or (3) after four hundred eons have elapsed. Theupahaccaparinibbāyī (“one who attains Nibbāna upon landing”) is explained asone who attains arahantship after passing the first half of the lifespan. ForSpk, the asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī (“one who attains without exertion”) and thesasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī (“one who attains with exertion”) then become twomodes in which the first two types of nonreturners attain the goal,respectively, easily and without strong effort, and with difficulty and strongeffort. However, this account of the first two types disregards the literalmeaning of their names and also overrides the sequential and mutually exclusivenature of the five types as delineated elsewhere in the suttas.If we understand the term antarāparinibbāyī literally, as it seems we should,it then means one who attains Nibbāna in the interval between two lives,perhaps while existing in a subtle body in the intermediate state. Theupahaccaparinibbāyī then becomes one who attains Nibbāna “upon landing” or“striking ground” in the new existence, i.e., almost immediately after takingrebirth. The next two terms designate two types who attain arahantship in thecourse of the next life, distinguished by the amount of effort they must make towin the goal. The last, the uddhaṃsota akaniṭṭhagāmī, is one who takesrebirth in successive pure abodes, completes the full lifespan in each, andfinally attains arahantship in the akaniṭṭha realm, the highest pureabode.This interpretation, though contrary to the Pāli commentaries, seems tobe confirmed by AN 7:52 (IV 70–74), in which the simile of the flaming chipsuggests that the seven types (including the three kinds ofantarāparinibbāyī) are mutually exclusive and have been graded according tothe sharpness of their faculties.34 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en228] In declaring that he does notrecognize a self or the belongings of a self among the five aggregates, Khemakahas implicitly declared that he has attained at least the level of astream-enterer. But the other monks did not realize that all the noble personsshare this understanding and assumed this was the unique realization of thearahant. Thus they misinterpreted Khemaka’s statement as insinuating that he hadattained arahantship.35 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en229] Although all three eds. of SNthat I consulted (Be, Ce, and Ee) and both eds. of Spk (Be and Ce) read asmī tiadhigataṃ, I suspect this is an archaic corruption that has gained currency. Ipropose reading asmī ti avigataṃ. The passage clarifies an essentialdifference between the trainee (sekha) and the arahant. While the sekha haseliminated identity view and thus no longer identifies any of the fiveaggregates as a self, he has not yet eradicated ignorance, which sustains aresidual conceit and desire “I am” (anusahagato asmī ti māno asmī ti chando)in relation to the five aggregates. The arahant, in contrast, has eradicatedignorance, the root of all misconceptions, and thus no longer entertains anyideas of “I” and “mine.” The other elders apparently had not yet attained anystage of awakening and thus did not understand this difference, but theVenerable Khemaka must have been at least a stream-enterer (some commentatorssay he was a nonreturner) and thus knew that the elimination of identity viewdoes not completely remove the sense of personal identity. Even for thenonreturner, an “odor of subjectivity” based on the five aggregates stilllingers over his experience.36 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en230] Spk: The worldling’s mentalprocess is like the soiled cloth. The three contemplations (of impermanence,suffering, and nonself) are like the three cleansers. The mental process of thenonreturner is like the cloth that has been washed with the three cleansers. Thedefilements to be eradicated by the path of arahantship are like the residualsmell of the cleansers. The knowledge of the path of arahantship is like thesweetly scented chest, and the destruction of all defilements by that path islike the vanishing of the residual smell of the cleansers from the cloth afterit has been placed in the chest.37 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en231] That is, outside the Buddha’steaching.38 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en232] As I understand it, “thatwhich is their destination … their final goal” is Nibbāna. We have here anotheressential difference between the trainee and the arahant: the trainee seesNibbāna, the destination of the five faculties, that in which they culminate,their fruit and final goal; however, he cannot “contact it with the body,”cannot enter upon the full experience of it. In contrast, the arahant both seesthe final goal and can fully experience it here and now.39 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en233] These are the thirty-sevenbodhipakkhiyā dhammā, lit. “states pertaining to enlightenment,” more freely:“aids to enlightenment.” On the four establishments of mindfulness, see TextVII,2 and Text VIII,8 for details and SN chapter 47. The four right kinds ofstriving are equivalent to right effort, for which see Text VII,2 and SN chapter49. The four bases for spiritual power are: concentration due to (1) desire, or(2) energy, or (3) mind, or (4) investigation, with volitional forces ofstriving; see SN chapter 51. The five faculties are at Text X,1(2); see SNchapter 48 for details. The five powers are the same five factors as thefaculties, but with greater strength. The seven factors of enlightenment are atText VIII,9; see SN chapter 46. The Noble Eightfold Path is at Text VII,2; seeSN chapter 45.40 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en234] Ps identifies this as theequanimity of the fourth jhāna. Ps says that Pukkusāti had already achievedthe fourth jhāna and was deeply attached to it. The Buddha first praises thisequanimity to inspire Pukkusāti’s confidence, and then gradually guides him tothe formless attainments and the supramundane paths and fruits.41 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en235] The sense is: If he attainsthe base of the infinity of space and passes away while still attached to it, hewould be reborn in the plane of the infinity of space and would live there forthe full lifespan of 20,000 eons specified for that plane. In the higher threeformless planes the lifespan is said to be, respectively, 40,000 eons, 60,000eons, and 84,000 eons.42 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en236] Ps: This is said in order toshow the danger in the formless attainments. By the one phrase, “This would beconditioned,” he shows: “Even though the lifespan there is 20,000 eons, it isconditioned, fashioned, built up. It is thus impermanent, unstable, not lasting,transient. It is subject to perishing, breaking up, and dissolution; it isinvolved with birth, aging, and death, founded upon suffering. It is not ashelter, a place of safety, a refuge. Having passed away there as a worldling,one can still be reborn in the four states of misery.”43 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en237] So n’eva abhisaṅkharotinābhisañcetayati bhavāya vā vibhavāya. The two verbs suggest the notion ofvolition as a constructive power that builds up and sustains conditionedexistence. Ceasing to will for either existence or nonexistence shows theextinction of craving for eternal existence and annihilation.44 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en238] Ps says that at this pointPukkusāti penetrated three paths and fruits, becoming a nonreturner. Herealized that his teacher was the Buddha himself, but he could not express thisrealization since the Buddha continued with his discourse.45 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en239] This passage shows thearahant’s abiding in the Nibbāna element with residue remaining (sa-upādisesanibbānadhātu); see Text IX,5(5). Though he continues to experience feelings,he is free from lust toward pleasant feeling, from aversion toward painfulfeeling, and from ignorance regarding neutral feeling.46 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en240] That is, he continues toexperience feeling only as long as the body with its life faculty continues, butnot beyond that.47 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en241] This refers to his attainmentof the Nibbāna-element with no residue remaining (anupādisesanibbānadhātu)—the cessation of all conditioned existence with his finalpassing away. See Text IX,5(5).48 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en242] This completes the expositionof the first foundation, the foundation of wisdom (paññādhiṭṭhāna). Ps saysthat the knowledge of the destruction of all suffering is the wisdom pertainingto the fruit of arahantship.49 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en243] Ps mentions four kinds ofacquisitions (upadhi) here: the five aggregates; defilements; volitionalformations; and sensual pleasures.50 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en244] The “tides of conceiving”(maññussavā), as the following paragraph will show, are thoughts and notionsoriginating from the three roots of conceiving—craving, conceit, and views. The“sage at peace” (muni santo) is the arahant.51 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en245] The thoughts “I shall be” and“I shall not be” imply the views of eternalism (continued existence after death)and annihilationism (personal extinction at death). The alternatives of havingphysical form and being formless represent two modes of existence in theafterlife, physical and disembodied; the triad of being percipient, etc., arethree other modes of existence in the afterlife, distinguished by theirrelationship to perception or awareness.52 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en246] That which is not present inhim is craving for existence, which leads to a new birth following death.53 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en247] Satta saddhammā. Faith, moralshame, fear of wrongdoing, learning, energy, mindfulness, and wisdom.

A muchmore elaborate version makes up DN 28.59 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en253] Spk identifies “of suchqualities” (evaṃdhammā) as “qualities pertaining to concentration”(samādhipakkhā dhammā).60 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en254] The ten Tathāgata’s powersare powers of knowledge. They are analyzed in detail at Vibh §§808–31. The“wheel of Brahmā” is the wheel of the Dhamma.61 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en255] For details, see MN 115.12–19.62 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en256] Ps explains possibility(ṭhāna) as the realm, circumstances, time, and effort, factors that can eitherimpede or reinforce the result. The cause (hetu) is the kamma itself. Thisknowledge of the Buddha is illustrated by Texts V,1(1)–(3).63 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en257] This signifies the Buddha’sknowledge of the types of conduct that lead to all future destinies within theround of existence as well as to final liberation. See MN 12.35–42.64 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en258] Vibh §813 explains that heunderstands that beings are of inferior and superior inclinations, and thatbeings naturally associate with those of similar inclinations.65 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en259] Vibh §§814–27 gives a detailedanalysis. Ps states more concisely that he knows the superior and inferiordisposition of the five faculties of other beings.66 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en260] Vibh §828: The defilement(saṅkilesa) is a factor causing decline; cleansing (vodāna) is a factorcausing excellence; emergence (vuṭṭhāna) is both cleansing and rising from anattainment. The eight emancipations (vimokkha) are at DN 15.35, DN 16.3.33, MN77.22, MN 137.26, etc.; the nine attainments (samāpatti) are the four jhānas,four formless attainments, and the cessation of perception and feeling.67 [edit_9780861719969_oeb_c10_r1.html#Ref-en261] Vesārajja.
