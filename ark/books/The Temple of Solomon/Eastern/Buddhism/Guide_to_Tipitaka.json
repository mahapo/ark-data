Three months after theparinibbæna of the Buddha, the great disciples recited together all theTeachings of their Master, after compiling them systematically andcarefully classifying them under different heads into specialized sections.The general discourses and sermons intended for both the bhikkhusand lay disciples, delivered by the Buddha on various occasions (togetherwith a few discourses delivered by some of his distinguished disciples), arecollected and classified in a great division known as the Suttanta Pi¥aka.The great division in which are incorporated injunctions andadmonitions of the Buddha on modes of conduct, and restraints on bothbodily and verbal actions of bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs, which form rulesof discipline for them, is called the Vinaya Pi¥aka.The philosophical aspect of the Buddha's Teaching, more profoundand abstract than the discourses of the Suttanta Pi¥aka, is classified underthe great division known as the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka. Abhidhamma dealswith ultimate Truths, expounds ultimate Truths and investigates Mindand Matter and the relationship between them.All that the Buddha taught forms the subject matter and substanceof the Pæ¹i Canon, which is divided into these three divisions calledPi¥akas — literally baskets. Hence Tipi¥aka means three baskets or threeseparate divisions of the Buddha's Teaching. Here the metaphor 'basket'signifies not so much the function of 'storing up' anything put into it asits use as a receptacle in which things are handed on or passed on fromone to another like carrying away of earth from an excavation site by aline of workers.The Tipi¥aka into which the Pæ¹i Canon is systematically dividedand handed down from generation to generation together withCommentaries forms the huge collection of literary works which the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"19bhikkhus of the Order have to learn, study and memorize in discharge oftheir gantha dhura, the duty of studying.AcknowledgementIt is a great privilege for me to have been entrusted with the task ofcompiling this 'Guide to Tipi¥aka'.

These rules embodyauthoritative injunctions of the Buddha on modes of conduct andrestraints on both physical and verbal actions. They deal withtransgressions of discipline, and with various categories of restraints andadmonitions in accordance with the nature of the offence.(a) Seven Kinds of Transgression or Offence, ÆpattiThe rules of discipline first laid down by the Buddha are calledMþlapaññatti (the root regulation); those supplemented later are knownas Anupaññatti. Together they are known as Sikkhæpadas, rules ofdiscipline. The act of transgressing these rules of discipline, therebyincurring a penalty by the guilty bhikkhu, is called Æpatti, which means'reaching, committing'.The offences for which penalties are laid down may be classifiedunder seven categories depending on their nature:(i) Pæræjika(ii) Saμghædisesa(iii)Thullaccaya(iv)Pæcittiya(v) Pæ¥idesanøya(vi)Dukka¥a(vii)Dubbhæsita.An offence in the first category of offences, Pæræjika, is classifiedas a grave offence, garukæpatti, which is irremediable, atekicchæ andentails the falling off of the offender from bhikkhuhood.An offence in the second category, Saμghædisesa, is also classifiedas a grave offence but it is remediable, satekicchæ. The offender is put ona probationary period of penance, during which he has to undertakecertain difficult practices and after which he is rehabilitated by theSaμgha assembly."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"22The remaining five categories consist of light offences, lahukæpatti,which are remediable and incur the penalty of having to confess thetransgression to another bhikkhu. After carrying out the prescribedpenalty, the bhikkhu transgressor becomes cleansed of the offence.(b) When and how the disciplinary rules were laid down.For twenty years after the establishment of the Order there wasneither injunction nor rule concerning Pæræjika and Saμghædisesaoffences. The members of the Order of the early days were all Ariyas, theleast advanced of whom was a Stream-winner, one who had attained thefirst Magga and Fruition, and there was no need for prescribing rulesrelating to grave offences.But as the years went by, the Saμgha grew in strength.Undesirable elements not having the purest of motives but attracted onlyby the fame and gain of the bhikkhus began to get into the Buddha'sOrder. Some twenty years after the founding of the Order, it becamenecessary to begin establishing rules relating to grave offences.It was through Bhikkhu Sudinna, a native of Kalanda Village nearVesælø, who committed the offence of having sexual intercourse with hisex-wife, that the first Pæræjika rule came to be promulgated. It was laiddown to deter bhikkhus from indulging in sexual intercourse.When such a grave cause had arisen for which the laying down ofa prohibitory rule became necessary, the Buddha convened an assemblyof the bhikkhus. It was only after questioning the bhikkhu concerned andafter the undesirability of committing such an offence had been madeclear that a certain rule was laid down in order to prevent future lapses ofsimilar nature.The Buddha also followed the precedence set by earlier Buddhas.Using his supernormal powers, he reflected on what rules the earlierBuddhas would lay down under certain given conditions. Then he adopt-ed similar regulations to meet the situation that had arisen in his time.(c) Admission of bhikkhunøs into the OrderAfter spending four vassas (residence period during the rains) afterhis Enlightenment, the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, his native royal city,at the request of his ailing father, King Suddhodana. At that time,Mahæpajæpati, Buddha's foster mother, requested him to admit her intothe Order. Mahæpajæpati was not alone in desiring to join the Order. Five"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"23hundred Sakyan ladies whose husbands had left the household life werealso eager to be admitted into the Order.After his father's death, the Buddha went back to Vesælø, refusingthe repeated request of Mahæpajæpati for admission into the Order. Thedetermined foster mother of the Buddha and widow of the recently de-ceased King Suddhodana, having cut off her hair and put on bark-dyedclothes, accompanied by five hundred Sakyan ladies, made her way to Vesæløwhere the Buddha was staying in the Mahævana, in the Kþ¥ægæra Hall.The Venerable Ænanda saw them outside the gateway of theKþ¥ægæra Hall, dust-laden with swollen feet, dejected, tearful, standingand weeping. Out of great compassion for the ladies, the VenerableÆnanda interceded with the Buddha on their behalf and entreated him toaccept them in the Order. The Buddha continued to stand firm. But whenthe Venerable Ænanda asked the Buddha whether women were notcapable of attaining Magga and Phala Insight, the Buddha replied thatwomen were indeed capable of doing so, provided they left the householdlife like their menfolk.Thereupon Ænanda made his entreaties again saying thatMahæpajæpati had been of great service to the Buddha waiting on him ashis guardian and nurse, suckling him when his mother died. And aswomen were capable of attaining the Magga and Phala Insight, sheshould be permitted to Join the Order and become a bhikkhunø.The Buddha finally acceded to Ænanda's entreaties: \"Ænanda, ifMahæpajæpati accepts eight special rules, garu-dhammæ, let suchacceptance mean her admission to the Order.\"The eight special rules1 are:(i) A bhikkhunø, even if she enjoys a seniority of a hundred years inthe Order, must pay respect to a bhikkhu though he may havebeen a bhikkhu only for a day.(ii) A bhikkhunø must not keep her rains-residence in a place wherethere are no bhikkhus.(iii) Every fortnight a bhikkhunø must do two things: To ask thebhikkhu Saμgha the day of uposatha, and to approach thebhikkhu Saμgha for instruction and admonition.(iv) When the rains-residence period is over, a bhikkhunø must attendthe paværa¼æ ceremony conducted at both the assemblies of 1 1. vide, Vinaya - II, 74-75."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs, in each of which she must invitecriticism on what has been seen, what has been heard or what hasbeen suspected of her.(v) A bhikkhunø who has committed a Saμghædisesa offence mustundergo penance for a half-month, pakkha mænatta, in eachassembly of bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs.(vi) Admission to the Order must be sought, from both assemblies, bya woman novice only after two year's probationary training as acandidate.(vii) A bhikkhunø should not revile a bhikkhu in any way, not evenobliquely.(viii) A bhikkhunø must abide by instructions given her by bhikkhus,but must not give instructions or advice to bhikkhus.Mahæpajæpati accepted unhesitatingly these eight conditionsimposed by the Buddha and was consequently admitted into the Order."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"25Chapter IIVINAYA PI¿AKAThe Vinaya Pi¥aka is made up of five books:(1) Pæræjika Pæ¹i(2) Pæcittiya Pæ¹i(3) Mahævagga Pæ¹i(4) Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i(5) Pariværa Pæ¹i1. Pæræjika Pæ¹iPæræjika Pæ¹i which is Book I of the Vinaya Pi¥aka gives anelaborate explanation of the important rules of discipline concerningPæræjika and Saμghædisesa, as well as Aniyata and Nissaggiya which areminor offences.(a) Pæræjika offences and penalties.Pæræjika discipline consists of four sets of rules laid down toprevent four grave offences. Any transgressor of these rules is defeated inhis purpose in becoming a bhikkhu. In the parlance of Vinaya, thePæræjika Æpatti falls upon him; he automatically loses the status of abhikkhu; he is no longer recognized as a member of the community ofbhikkhus and is not permitted to become a bhikkhu again. He has eitherto go back to the household life as a layman or revert back to the status ofa sæma¼era, a novice.One who has lost the status of a bhikkhu for transgression of anyof these rules is likened to (i) a person whose head has been cut off fromhis body; he cannot become alive even if the head is fixed back on thebody; (ii) leaves which have fallen off the branches of the tree; they willnot become green again even if they are attached back to the leaf-stalks;(iii) a flat rock which has been split; it cannot be made whole again; (iv) apalm tree which has been cut off from its stem; it will never grow again.Four Pæræjika offences which lend to loss of status as a bhikkhu.(i) The first Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should indulge in sexualintercourse loses his bhikkhuhood."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"26(ii) The second Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should take with intention tosteal what is not given loses his bhikkhuhood.(iii) The third Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should intentionally deprive ahuman being of life loses his bhikkhuhood.(iv) The fourth Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu claims to attainments he doesnot really possess, namely, attainments to jhæna or Magga and PhalaInsight loses his bhikkhuhood.The Pæræjika offender is guilty of a very grave transgression. Heceases to be a bhikkhu. His offence, Æpatti, is irremediable.(b) Thirteen Saμghædisesa offences and penalties.Saμghædisesa discipline consists of a set of thirteen rules whichrequire formal participation of the Saμgha from beginning to end in theprocess of making him free from the guilt of transgression.(i) A bhikkhu having transgressed these rules, and wishing to be freefrom his offence must first approach the Saμgha and confess havingcommitted the offence. The Saμgha determines his offence andorders him to observe the parivæsa penance, a penalty requiring himto live under suspension from association with the rest of the Saμgha,for as many days as he has knowingly concealed his offence.(ii) At the end of the parivæsa observance he undergoes a further periodof penance, mænatta, for six days to gain approbation of the Saμgha.(iii) Having carried out the mænatta penance, the bhikkhu requests theSaμgha to reinstate him to full association with the rest of the Saμgha.Being now convinced of the purity of his conduct as before, theSaμgha lifts the Æpatti at a special congregation attended by at leasttwenty bhikkhus, where ñatti, the motion for his reinstatement, is recitedfollowed by three recitals of kammavæcæ, procedural text for formal actsof the Saμgha.Some examples of the Saμghædisesa offences.(i) Kæyasaμsagga offence:If any bhikkhu with lustful, perverted thoughts engages in bodily contactwith a woman, such as holding of hands, caressing the tresses of hair ortouching any part of her body, he commits the KæyasaμsaggaSaμghædisesa offence."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"27(ii) Sañcaritta offence:If any bhikkhu acts as a go-between between a man and a woman fortheir lawful living together as husband and wife or for temporaryarrangement as man and mistress or woman and lover, he is guilty ofSañcaritta Saμghædisesa offence.(c) Two Aniyata offences and penalties.Aniyata means indefinite, uncertain. There are two Aniyataoffences the nature of which is uncertain and indefinite as to whether it isa Pæræjika offence, a Saμghædisesa offence or a Pæcittiya offence. It is tobe determined according to provisions in the following rules:(i) If a bhikkhu sits down privately alone with a woman in a placewhich is secluded and hidden from view, and convenient for animmoral purpose and if a trustworthy lay woman (i.e., an Ariya),seeing him, accuses him of any one of the three offences (1) aPæræjika offence (2) a Saμghædisesa offence (3) a Pæcittiya offence,and the bhikkhu himself admits that he was so sitting, he should befound guilty of one of these three offences as accused by thetrustworthy lay woman.(ii) If a bhikkhu sits down privately alone with a woman in a placewhich is not hidden from view and not convenient for an immoralpurpose but convenient for talking lewd words to her, and if atrustworthy lay woman (i.e., an Ariya), seeing him, accuses him ofany one of the two offences (1) a Saμghædisesa offence (2) aPæcittiya offence, and the bhikkhu himself admits that he was sositting, he should be found guilty of one of these two offences asaccused by the trustworthy lay woman.(d) Thirty Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offences and penalties.There are thirty rules under the Nissaggiya category of offencesand penalties which are laid down to curb inordinate greed in bhikkhusfor possession of material things such as robes, bowls etc. To give anexample, an offence is done under these rules when objects not permittedare acquired, or when objects are acquired in more than the permittedquantity. The penalty consists firstly of giving up the objects in respect ofwhich the offence has been committed. Then it is followed by confessionof the breach of the rule, together with an undertaking not to repeat thesame offence, to the Saμgha as a whole, or to a group of bhikkhus, or toan individual bhikkhu to whom the wrongfully acquired objects havebeen surrendered."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"28Some examples of the Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offences.(i) First Nissaggiya Sikkhæpada.If any bhikkhu keeps more than the permissible number of robes, namely,the lower robe, the upper robe and the great robe, he commits an offencefor which he has to surrender the extra robes and confess his offence.(ii) Cøvara Acchindana Sikkhæpada.If any bhikkhu gives away his own robe to another bhikkhu and after-wards, being angry or displeased, takes it back forcibly or causes it to betaken away by someone else, he commits a Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offence.Nissaggiya offences are light offences compared with the graveoffences of Pæræjika Æpatti or Saμghædisesa Æpatti.2. Pæcittiya Pæ¹iThe Pæcittiya Pæ¹i which is Book II of the Vinaya Pi¥aka deals withthe remaining sets of rules for the bhikkhus, namely, the Pæcittiya, thePæ¥idesanøya, Sekhiya, Adhikara¼asamatha and the correspondingdisciplinary rules for the bhikkhunøs. Although it is called in Pæ¹i justPæcittiya, it has the distinctive name of 'Suddha Pæcittiya', ordinaryPæcittiya, to distinguish it from Nissaggiya Pæcittiya, described above.(a) Ninety-two Pæcittiya offences and penalties.There are ninety-two rules under this class of offences classified innine sections. A few examples of this type of offences: (i) Telling a lie deliberately is a Pæcittiya offence. (ii) A bhikkhu who sleeps under the same roof and within the walls along with a woman commits a Pæcittiya offence. (iii) A bhikkhu who digs the ground or causes it to be dug commits aPæcittiya offence.A Pæcittiya offence is remedied merely by admission of theoffence to a bhikkhu."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"29(b) Four Pæ¥idesanøya offences and penalties.There are four offences under this classification and they all dealwith the bhikkhu's conduct in accepting and eating alms-food offered tohim. The bhikkhu transgressing any of these rules, in making admissionof his offence, must use a special formula stating the nature of his fault.The first rule of Pæ¥idesanøya offence reads: should a bhikkhu eathard food or soft food having accepted it with his own hand from abhikkhunø who is not his relation and who has gone among the houses foralms-food, it should be admitted to another bhikkhu by the bhikkhu saying,\"Friend, I have done a censurable thing which is unbecoming and whichshould be admitted. I admit having committed a Pætidesanøya offence.\"The events that led to the laying down of the first of these ruleshappened in Sævatthi, where one morning bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs weregoing round for alms-food. A certain bhikkhunø offered the food she hadreceived to a certain bhikkhu who took away all that was in her bowl.The bhikkhunø had to go without any food for the day. Three days insuccession she offered to give her alms-food to the same bhikkhu who onall the three days deprived her of her entire alms-food. Consequently shebecame famished. On the fourth day while going on the alms round shefainted and fell down through weakness. When the Buddha came to hearabout this, he censured the bhikkhu who was guilty of the wrong deedand laid down the above rule.(c) Seventy-five Sekhiya rules of polite behaviour.These seventy-five rules laid down originally for the properbehaviour of bhikkhus also apply to novices who seek admission to theOrder. Most of these rules were all laid down at Sævatthi on account ofindisciplined behaviour on the part of a group of six bhikkhus. The rulescan be divided into four groups. The first group of twenty-six rules isconcerned with good conduct and behaviour when going into towns andvillages. The second group of thirty rules deals with polite manners whenaccepting alms-food and when eating meals. The third group of sixteenrules contains rules which prohibit teaching of the Dhamma todisrespectful people. The fourth group of three rules relates tounbecoming ways of answering the calls of nature and of spitting.(d) Seven ways of settling disputes, Adhikara¼asamatha.Pæcittiya Pæ¹i concludes the disciplinary rules for bhikkhus with aChapter on seven ways of settling cases, Adhikara¼asamatha."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"30Four kinds of cases are listed:(i) Vivædædhikara¼a — Disputes as to what is dhamma, what is notdhamma; what is Vinaya, what is not Vinaya; what the Buddha said,what the Buddha did not say; and what constitutes an offence, whatis not an offence.(ii) Anuvædædhikara¼a — Accusations and disputes arising out of themconcerning the virtue, practice, views and way of living of a bhikkhu.(iii) Æpattædhikara¼a — Infringement of any disciplinary rule.(iv) Kiccædhikara¼a — Formal meeting or decisions made by the Saμgha.For settlement of such disputes that may arise from time to timeamongst the Order, precise and detailed methods are prescribed underseven heads:(i) Sammukhæ Vinaya — before coming to a decision, conducting anenquiry in the presence of both parties in accordance with the rulesof Vinaya.(ii) Sati Vinaya — making a declaration by the Saμgha of the innocenceof an Arahat against whom some allegations have been made, afterasking him if he remembers having committed the offence.(iii) Amþ¹ha Vinaya — making a declaration by the Saμgha when theaccused is found to be insane.(iv) Patiññæta Kara¼a — making a decision after admission by the partyconcerned.(v) Yebhuyyasika Kamma — making a decision in accordance with themajority vote.(vi) Tassapæpiyasika Kamma — making a declaration by the Saμghawhen the accused proves to be unreliable, making admissions only toretract them, evading questions and telling lies.(vii)Ti¼avatthæraka Kamma —‘'the act of covering up with grass'’ ——exonerating all offences except the offences of Pæræjika,Saμghædisesa and those in connection with laymen and laywomen,when the disputing parties are made to reconcile by the Saμgha.(e) Rules of Discipline for the bhikkhunøs.The concluding chapters in the Pæcittiya Pæ¹i are devoted to therules of Discipline for the bhikkhunøs.

Mahævagga Pæ¹i.The next two books, namely, Mahævagga Pæ¹i which is Book IIIand Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i which is Book IV of the Vinaya Pi¥aka, deal with allthose matters relating to the Saμgha which have not been dealt with inthe first two books.Mahævagga Pæ¹i, made up of ten sections known as Khandhakas,opens with an historical account of how the Buddha attained SupremeEnlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi Tree, how he discovered thefamous law of Dependent Origination, how he gave his first sermon tothe Group of Five Bhikkhus on the discovery of the Four Noble Truths,namely, the great Discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"32Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. This was followed by another greatdiscourse, the Anattalakkha¼a Sutta. These two suttas may be describedas the Compendium of the Teaching of the Buddha.The first section continues to describe how young men of goodfamilies like Yasa sought refuge in him as a Buddha and embraced hisTeaching; how the Buddha embarked upon the unique mission ofspreading the Dhamma 'for the welfare and happiness of the many' whenhe had collected round him sixty disciples who were well established inthe Dhamma and had become Arahats; how he began to establish theOrder of the Saμgha to serve as a living example of the Truth hepreached; and how his famous disciples like Særiputta, Moggallæna,Mahæ Kassapa, Ænanda, Upæli, A³gulimæla became members of theOrder. The same section then deals with the rules for formal admission tothe Order, (Upasampadæ), giving precise conditions to be fulfilled beforeany person can gain admission to the Order and the procedure to befollowed for each admission.Mahævagga further deals with procedures for an Uposathameeting, the assembly of the Saμgha on every full moon day and on thefourteenth or fifteenth waning day of the lunar month when Pætimokkha,a summary of the Vinaya rules, is recited. Then there are rules to beobserved for rains retreat (vassa) during the rainy season as well as thosefor the formal ceremony of paværa¼æ concluding the rains retreat, inwhich a bhikkhu invites criticism from his brethren in respect of what hasbeen seen, heard or suspected about his conduct.There are also rules concerning sick bhikkhus, the use of leatherfor footwear and furniture, materials for robes, and those concerningmedicine and food. A separate section deals with the Kathina ceremonieswhere annual making and offering of robes take place.4. Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹iCþ¹avagga Pæ¹i which is Book IV of the Vinaya Pi¥aka continues todeal with more rules and procedures for institutional acts or functionsknown as Saμghakamma. The twelve sections in this book deal withrules for offences such as Saμghædisesa that come before the Saμgha;rules for observance of penances such as parivæsa and mænatta and rulesfor reinstatement of a bhikkhu. There are also miscellaneous rulesconcerning bathing, dress, dwellings and furniture and those dealing withtreatment of visiting bhikkhus, and duties of tutors and novices. Some of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"33the important enactments are concerned with Tajjanøya Kamma, formalact of censure by the Saμgha taken against those bhikkhus who causestrife, quarrels, disputes, who associate familiarly with lay people andwho speak in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha;Ukkhepanøya Kamma, formal act of suspension to be taken against thosewho having committed an offence do not want to admit it; andPakæsanøya Kamma taken against Devadatta announcing publicly that\"Whatever Devadatta does by deed or word, should be seen asDevadatta's own and has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Dhammaand the Saμgha.\" The account of this action is followed by the story ofDevadatta's three attempts on the life of the Buddha and the schismcaused by Devadatta among the Saμgha.There is, in section ten, the story of how Mahæpajæpati, theBuddha's foster mother, requested admission into the Order, how theBuddha refused permission at first, and how he finally acceded to therequest because of Ænanda's entreaties on her behalf.The last two sections describe two important events of historicalinterest, namely, the holding of the first Synod at Ræjagaha and of thesecond Synod at Vesælø.5. Pariværa Pæ¹iPariværa Pæ¹i which is Book V and the last book of the VinayaPi¥aka serves as a kind of manual. It is compiled in the form of acatechism, enabling the reader to make an analytical survey of the VinayaPi¥aka. All the rules, official acts, and other matters of the Vinaya areclassified under separate categories according to subjects dealt with.Pariværa explains how rules of the Order are drawn up to regulatethe conduct of the bhikkhus as well as the administrative affairs of theOrder. Precise procedures are prescribed for settling of disputes andhandling matters of jurisprudence, for formation of Saμgha courts andappointment of well-qualified Saμgha judges. It lays down how SaμghaVinicchaya Committee, the Saμgha court, is to be constituted with abody of learned Vinayadharas, experts in Vinaya rules, to hear and decideall kinds of monastic disputes.The Pariværa Pæ¹i provides general principles and guidance in thespirit of which all the Saμgha Vinicchaya proceedings are to beconducted for settlement of monastic disputes."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"34Chapter IIIWHAT IS SUTTANTA PI¿AKA?The Suttanta Pi¥aka is a collection of all the discourses in theirentirety delivered by the Buddha on various occasions. (A few discoursesdelivered by some of the distinguished disciples of the Buddha, such asthe Venerable Særiputta, Mahæ Moggallæna, Ænanda, etc., as well assome narratives are also included in the books of the Suttanta Pi¥aka.)The discourses of the Buddha compiled together in the Suttanta Pi¥akawere expounded to suit different occasions, for various persons withdifferent temperaments. Although the discourses were mostly intendedfor the benefit of bhikkhus, and deal with the practice of the pure life andwith the exposition of the Teaching, there are also several other dis-courses which deal with the material and moral progress of the lay disciples.The Suttanta Pi¥aka brings out the meaning of the Buddha'steachings, expresses them clearly, protects and guards them againstdistortion and misconstruction. Just like a string which serves as a plumb-line to guide the carpenters in their work, just like a thread which protectsflowers from being scattered or dispersed when strung together by it,likewise by means of suttas, the meaning of Buddha's teachings may bebrought out clearly, grasped and understood correctly and given perfectprotection from being misconstrued.The Suttanta Pi¥aka is divided into five separate collections knownas Nikæyas. They are Døgha Nikæya, Majjhima Nikæya, Saμyutta Nikæya,A³guttara Nikæya and Khuddaka Nikæya.(a) Observances and Practices in the Teaching of the Buddha.In the Suttanta Pi¥aka are found not only the fundamentals of theDhamma but also pragmatic guidelines to make the Dhamma meaningfuland applicable to daily life. All observances and practices which formpractical steps in the Buddha's Noble Path of Eight Constituents lead tospiritual purification at three levels:Søla — moral purity through right conduct,Samædhi — purity of mind through concentration (Samatha),Paññæ — purity of Insight through Vipassanæ Meditation."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"35To begin with, one must make the right resolution to take refuge inthe Buddha, to follow the Buddha's Teaching, and to be guided by theSaμgha. The first disciples who made the declaration of faith in theBuddha and committed themselves to follow his Teaching were the twomerchant brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika. They were travelling with theirfollowers in five hundred carts when they saw the Buddha in the vicinityof the Bodhi Tree after his Enlightenment. The two merchants offeredhim honey rice cakes. Accepting their offering and thus breaking the fasthe had imposed on himself for seven weeks, the Buddha made them hisdisciples by letting them recite after him:\"Buddhaμ Saranaμ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Buddha).\"\"Dhammaμ Saranaμ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Dhammæ).\"This recitation became the formula of declaration of faith in theBuddha and his Teaching. Later when the Saμgha became established,the formula was extended to include the third commitment:\"Saμghaμ Saranaμ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Saμgha).\"(b) On the right way to give alms.As a practical step, capable of immediate and fruitful use bypeople in all walks of life, the Buddha gave discourses on charity, alms-giving, explaining its virtues and on the right way and the right attitude ofmind with which an offering is to be made for spiritual uplift.The motivating force in an act of charity is the volition, the will togive. Charity is a meritorious action that arises only out of volition.Without the will to give, there is no act of giving. Volition in giving almsis of three types:(i) The volition that starts with the thought 'I shall make an offering'and that exists during the period of preparations for making theoffering — Pubba Cetanæ, volition before the act.(ii) The volition that arises at the moment of making the offering whilehanding it over to the donee — Muñca Cetanæ, volition during the act.(iii) The volition accompanying the joy and rejoicing which arise duringrepeated recollection of or reflection on the act of giving — AparaCetanæ, volition after the act."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"36Whether the offering is made in homage to the living Buddha or toa minute particle of his relics after his passing away, it is the volition, itsstrength and purity that determine the nature of the result thereof.There is also explained in the discourses the wrong attitude ofmind with which no act of charity should be performed.A donor should avoid looking down on others who cannot make asimilar offering; nor should he exult over his own charity. Defiled bysuch unworthy thoughts, his volition is only of inferior grade.When the act of charity is motivated by expectations of beneficialresults of immediate prosperity and happiness, or rebirth in higherexistences, the accompanying volition is classed as mediocre.It is only when the good deed of alms-giving is performed out of aspirit of renunciation, motivated by thoughts of pure selflessness, aspiringonly for attainment to Nibbæna where all suffering ends, that the volitionthat brings about the act is regarded as of superior grade.Examples abound in the discourses concerning charity and modesof giving alms.(c) Moral Purity through right conduct, Søla.Practice of Søla forms a most fundamental aspect of Buddhism. Itconsists of practice of Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihoodto purge oneself of impure deeds, words and thoughts. Together with thecommitment to the Threefold Refuge (as described above) a Buddhist laydisciple observes the Five Precepts by making a formal vow:(i) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from killing.(ii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from stealing.(iii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from sexualmisconduct.(iv) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from telling lies.(v) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from alcoholicdrinks, drugs or intoxicants that becloud the mind.In addition to the negative aspect of the above formula whichemphasizes abstinence, there is also the positive aspect of Søla. Forinstance, we find in many discourses the statement: 'He refrains fromkilling, puts aside the cudgel and the sword; full of kindness and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"37compassion he lives for the welfare and happiness of all living things.'Every precept laid down in the formula has these two aspects.Depending upon the individual and the stage of one's progress,other forms of precepts, namely, Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts etc. may beobserved. For the bhikkhus of the Order, higher and advanced types ofpractices of morality are laid down. The Five Precepts are to be alwaysobserved by lay disciples who may occasionally enhance their self-discipline by observing the Eight or Ten Precepts. For those who havealready embarked on the path of a holy life, the Ten Precepts are essentialpreliminaries to further progress.Søla of perfect purity serves as a foundation for the next stage ofprogress, namely, Samædhi purity of mind through concentration-meditation.(d) Practical methods of mental cultivation for development ofconcentration, samædhi.Mental cultivation for spiritual uplift consists of two steps. Thefirst step is to purify the mind from all defilements and corruption and tohave it focused on a point. A determined effort (Right Exertion) must bemade to narrow down the range of thoughts in the wavering, unsteadymind. Then attention (Right Mindfulness or Attentiveness) must be fixedon a selected object of meditation until one-pointedness of mind (RightConcentration) is achieved. In such a state, the mind becomes freed fromhindrances, pure, tranquil, powerful and bright. It is then ready toadvance to the second step by which Magga Insight and Fruition may beattained in order to transcend the state of woe and sorrow.The Suttanta Pi¥aka records numerous methods of meditation tobring about one-pointedness of mind. In the Suttas of the Pi¥aka aredispersed these methods of meditation, explained by the Buddhasometimes singly, sometimes collectively to suit the occasion and thepurpose for which they are recommended. The Buddha knew thediversity of character and mental make-up of each individual, thedifferent temperaments and inclinations of those who approached him forguidance. Accordingly he recommended different methods to differentpersons to suit the special character and need of each individual.The practice of mental cultivation which results ultimately in one-pointedness of mind is known as Samædhi Bhævanæ. Whoever wishes todevelop Samædhi Bhævanæ must have been established in the observanceof the precepts, with the senses controlled, calm and self-possessed, and"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"38must be contented. Having been established in these four conditions heselects a place suitable for meditation, a secluded spot. Then he should sitcross-legged keeping his body erect and his mind alert; he should startpurifying his mind of five hindrances, namely, sensual desire, ill will,sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt, by choosing ameditation method suitable to him, practicing meditation with zeal andardour. For instance, with the Ænæpæna method he keeps watching theincoming and outgoing breath until he can have his mind fixed securelyon the breath at the tip of the nose.When he realizes that the five hindrances have been got rid of, hebecomes gladdened, delighted, calm and blissful. This is the beginning ofsamædhi, concentration, which will further develop until it attains one-pointedness of mind.Thus one-pointedness of mind is concentration of mind when it isaware of one object, and only one of a wholesome, salutary nature. Thisis attained by the practice of meditation upon one of the subjectsrecommended for the purpose by the Buddha.(e) Practical methods of mental cultivation for development of InsightKnowledge, paññæ.The subject and methods of meditation as taught in the suttas of thePi¥aka are designed both for attainment of samædhi as well as for develop-ment of Insight Knowledge, Vipassanæ Ñæ¼a, as a direct path to Nibbæna.As a second step in the practice of meditation, after achievingsamædhi, when the concentrated mind has become purified, firm andimperturbable, the meditator directs and inclines his mind to InsightKnowledge, Vipassanæ Ñæ¼a. With this Insight Knowledge he discernsthe three characteristics of the phenomenal world, namely,Impermanence (Anicca), Suffering (Dukkha) and Non-Self (Anatta).As he advances in his practice and his mind becomes more andmore purified, firm and imperturbable, he directs and inclines his mind tothe knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants, Æsavakkhaya Ñæ¼a.He then truly understands dukkha, the cause of dukkha, the cessation ofdukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha. He also comes tounderstand fully the moral intoxicants (æsavas) as they really are, thecause of æsavas, the cessation of æsavas and the path leading to thecessation of the æsavas."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"39With this knowledge of extinction of æsavas he becomes liberated.The knowledge of liberation arises in him. He knows that rebirth is nomore, that he has lived the holy life; he has done what he has to do for therealization of Magga; there is nothing more for him to do for suchrealization.The Buddha taught with only one object — the extinction ofSuffering and release from conditioned existence. That object is to beobtained by the practice of meditation (for Calm and Insight) as laiddown in numerous suttas of the Suttanta Pi¥aka."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"40Chapter IVSUTTANTA PI¿AKADøgha NikæyaCollection of Long Discourses of the BuddhaThis Collection in the Suttanta Pi¥aka, named Døgha Nikæya as itis made up of thirty-four long discourses of the Buddha, is divided intothree divisions: (a) Sølakkhandha Vagga, Division Concerning Morality(b) Mahæ Vagga, the Large Division (c) Pæthika Vagga, the Divisionbeginning with the discourse on Pæthika, the Naked Ascetic.(a) Sølakkhandha Vagga Pæ¹iDivision Concerning MoralityThis division contains thirteen suttas which deal extensively withvarious types of morality, namely, Minor Morality, basic moralityapplicable to all; Middle Morality and Major Morality which are mostlypractised by Sama¼as and Bræhma¼as. It also discusses the wrong viewsthen prevalent as well as brahmin views of sacrifice and caste, andvarious religious practices such as extreme self-mortification.(1) Brahmajæla Sutta, Discourse on the Net of Perfect Wisdom.An argument between Suppiya, a wandering ascetic, and his pupilBrahmadatta, with the teacher maligning the Buddha, the Dhamma andthe Saμgha and the pupil praising the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha,gave rise to this famous discourse which is listed first in this Nikæya.In connection with the maligning of the Buddha, the Dhamma andthe Saμgha, the Buddha enjoined his disciples not to feel resentment, nordispleasure nor anger, because it would only be spiritually harmful tothem. As to the words of praise for the Buddha, the Dhamma and theSaμgha, the Buddha advised his disciples not to feel pleased, delightedor elated, for it would be an obstacle to their progress in the Path.The Buddha said that whatever worldling, puthujjana, praised theBuddha he could not do full justice to the peerless virtues of the Buddha,namely, his Superior Concentration, samædhi, and Wisdom, paññæ. Aworldling could touch on only \"matters of a trifling and inferior nature,mere morality.\" The Buddha explained the three grades of morality and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"41said there were other dhammas profound, hard to see, subtle andintelligible only to the wise. Anyone wishing to praise correctly the truevirtues of the Buddha should do so only in terms of these dhammas.Then the Buddha continued to expound on various wrong views.There were sama¼as and bræhma¼as who, speculating on the past,adhered to and asserted their wrong views in eighteen different ways,namely:(i) Four Kinds of Belief in Eternity, Sassata Di¥¥hi,(ii) Four Kinds of Dualistic belief in Eternity and Non-eternity, EkaccaSassata Di¥¥hi,(iii) Four Views of the World being Finite or Infinite, Antænanta Di¥¥hi,(iv) Four Kinds of ambiguous evasion, Amarævikkhepa Væda,(v) Two Doctrines of Non-Causality, Adhiccasamuppanna Væda.There were sama¼as and bræhma¼as, who, speculating on thefuture, adhered to and asserted their wrong views in forty-four ways,namely:(i) Sixteen Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Saññæ after death,Uddhæmæghætanika Saññø Væda,(ii) Eight Kinds of Belief in the Non-Existence of Saññæ after death,Uddhamæghætanika Asaññø Væda,(iii)Eight Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Neither Saññæ Nor Non-saññæ after death, Uddhamæghætanika Nevasaññø Næsaññø Væda,(iv)Seven Kinds of Belief in Annihilation, Uccheda Væda,(v) Five Kinds of Mundane Nibbæna as realizable in this very life,Di¥¥hadhamma Nibbæna Væda.The Buddha said that whatever sama¼as and bræhma¼asspeculated on the past, or the future or both the past and the future, theydid so in these sixty-two ways or one of these sixty-two ways.The Buddha announced further that he knew all these wrongviews and also what would be the destination, the next existence, inwhich the one holding these views would be reborn.The Buddha gave a detailed analysis of these wrong viewsasserted in sixty-two ways and pointed out that these views had theirorigin in feeling which arose as a result of repeated contact through thesix sense bases.

The Buddha explained to him theadvantage of the life of a sama¼a by giving him the examples of a servantof his household or a landholder cultivating the King's own landbecoming a sama¼a to whom the King himself would show respect andmake offerings of requisites, providing him protection and security at thesame time.The Buddha provided further elucidation on other advantages,higher and better, of being a sama¼a by elaborating on (i) how ahouseholder, hearing the dhamma taught by a Buddha, leaves the homelife and becomes a sama¼a out of pure faith; (ii) how he becomesestablished in three categories of Søla, minor, middle and major; (iii) howhe gains control over his sense-faculties so that no depraved states ofmind as covetousness and dissatisfaction would overpower him; (iv) howhe becomes endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension andremains contented; (v) how, by dissociating himself from five hindrances,he achieves the four jhænas — the first, the second, the third and thefourth — as higher advantages than those previously mentioned; (vi) howhe becomes equipped with eight kinds of higher knowledge, namely,Insight Knowledge, the Power of Creation by Mind, the Psychic Powers,the Divine Power of Hearing, Knowledge of the Minds of others,Knowledge of Past Existences, Divine Power of Sight, Knowledge ofExtinction of moral intoxicants."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"43Thus when the knowledge of liberation arises in him, he knows hehas lived the life of purity. There is no other advantage of being asama¼a, personally experienced, more pleasing and higher than this.(3) Amba¥¥ha Sutta.Amba¥¥ha, a young disciple of Pokkharasæti, the learned brahmin,was sent by his master to investigate whether Gotama was a genuineBuddha endowed with thirty-two personal characteristics of a great man.His insolent behaviour, taking pride in his birth as a brahmin, led theBuddha to subdue him by proving that Khattiya is in fact superior toBræhma¼a. The Buddha explained further that nobleness in man stemmednot from birth but from perfection in three categories of morality,achievements of four jhænas, and accomplishments in eight kinds ofhigher knowledge.(4) So¼adanda Sutta.This discourse was given to the brahmin So¼adanda whoapproached the Buddha while he was residing near Lake Gaggaræ atCampæ in the country of A³ga. He was asked by the Buddha whatattributes one should possess to be acknowledged as a brahmin.So¼adanda enumerated high birth, learning in the Vedas, goodpersonality, morality and knowledge as essential qualities to be abrahmin. When further questioned by the Buddha, he said that theminimum qualifications were morality and knowledge without which noone would be entitled to be called a brahmin. On his request, the Buddhaexplained to him the meaning of the terms morality and knowledge,which he confessed to be ignorant of, namely, the three categories ofmorality, achievements of four jhænas and accomplishments in eightkinds of higher knowledge.(5) Kþ¥adanta SuttaOn the eve of offering a great sacrificial feast, the brahminKþ¥adanta went to see the Buddha for advice on how best to conduct thesacrifice. Giving the example of a former King Mahævijita, who alsomade a great sacrificial offering, the Buddha declared the principle ofconsent by four parties from the provinces, namely, noblemen, ministers,rich brahmins and householders; the eight qualities to be possessed by theking who would make the offerings; the four qualities of the brahmin"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"44royal adviser who would conduct the ceremonies and the three attitudesof mind towards the sacrifices. With all these conditions fulfilled, thefeast offered by the king was a great success, with no loss of life ofsacrificial animals, no hardship on the people, no one impressed intoservice, every one co-operating in the great feast willingly.The brahmin Kþ¥adanta then asked the Buddha if there was anysacrifice which could be made with less trouble and exertion, yetproducing more fruitful result. The Buddha told him of the traditionalpractice of offering the four requisites to bhikkhus of high morality. Lesstroublesome and more profitable again was donating a monastery to theOrder of Bhikkhus. Better still were the following practices in ascendingorder of beneficial effects: (i) going to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and theSaμgha for refuge; (ii) observance of the Five Precepts; (iii) going forthfrom the home life and leading the holy life, becoming established inmorality, accomplished in the four jhænas, and equipped with eight kindsof higher knowledge resulting in the realization of extinction of æsavas,the sacrifice which entails less trouble and exertion but which excels allother sacrifices.(6) Mahæli SuttaMahæli O¥¥haddha, a Licchavø ruler, once came to see the Buddhato whom he recounted what Sunakkhatta, a Licchavø prince, had told him.Sunakkhatta had been a disciple of the Buddha for three years after whichhe left the Teaching. He told Mahæli how he had acquired the DivinePower of Sight by which he had seen myriads of pleasant, desirable formsbelonging to the deva world but that he had not heard sounds belonging tothe deva world. Mahæli wanted to know from the Buddha whetherSunakkhatta did not hear the sounds of the deva world because they werenon-existent, or whether he did not hear them although they existed.The Buddha explained that there were sounds in the deva worldbut Sunakkhatta did not hear them because he had developedconcentration only for one purpose, to achieve the Divine Power of Sightbut not the Divine Power of Hearing.The Buddha explained further that his disciples practiced thenoble life under him not to acquire such divine powers but with a view tothe realization of dhammas which far excel and transcend these mundanekinds of concentrations. Such dhammas are attainments of the Four Statesof Noble Fruition — states of a stream-winner, a once-returner, a non-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"45returner, and the state of mind and knowledge of an Arahat freed of allæsavas that have been rendered extinct.The Path by which these dhammas can be realized is the NoblePath of Eight Constituents: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech,Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, RightConcentration.(7) Jæliya SuttaOnce when the Buddha was residing at Ghositæræma Monasterynear Kosambø, two wandering ascetics Mu¼ðiya and Jæliya approached himand asked whether the soul was the physical body, or the physical body thesoul, or whether the soul was one thing and the physical body another.The Buddha explained how a person who had finally realizedliberation would not even consider whether the soul was the physicalbody, or the physical body the soul or whether the soul was one thing andthe physical body another.(8) Mæhasøhanæda SuttaThis discourse defines what a true sama¼a is, what a truebræmna¼a is. The Buddha was residing in the Deer Park of Ka¼¼akathalaat Uruññæ. Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached him and said thathe had heard that Sama¼a Gotama disparaged all practices of self-mortification and that Sama¼a Gotama reviled all those who led anaustere life.The Buddha replied that they were slandering him with what wasnot said, what was not true. When the Buddha could see with hissupernormal vision the bad destinies as well as the good destinies ofthose who practiced extreme forms of self-mortification, and of thosewho practiced less extreme forms of self-mortification, how could herevile all systems of self-mortification?Kassapa then maintained that only those recluses who for thewhole of their life cultivated the practice of standing or sitting, who wereabstemious in food, eating only once in two days, seven days, fifteendays etc., were real sama¼as and bræhma¼as. The Buddha explained tohim the futility of extreme self-mortification and said that only when arecluse practiced to become accomplished in morality, concentration andknowledge; cultivated loving-kindness, and dwelt in the emancipation ofmind, and emancipation through knowledge that he would be entitled to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"46be called a sama¼a and bræhma¼a. Then the Buddha gave full expositionon morality, concentration and knowledge, resulting in Kassapa'sdecision to join the Order of the Buddha.(9) Po¥¥hapæda SuttaOnce when the Buddha was staying at the Monastery ofAnæthæpi¼ðika in the Jeta Grove at Sævatthi he visited the Ekasælaka Hallwhere various views were debated. At that time Po¥¥hapæda the wanderingascetic asked him about the nature of the cessation of Consciousness(saññæ). Po¥¥hapæda wanted to know how the cessation of Consciousnesswas brought about. The Buddha told him that it was through reason andcause that forms of Consciousness in a being arose and ceased. A certainform of Consciousness arose through practice (Adhicitta sikkhæ) and acertain form of Consciousness ceased through practice.The Buddha then proceeded to expound on these practicesconsisting of observance of søla and development of concentration whichresulted in arising and ceasing of successive jhænas. The meditatorprogressed from one stage to the next in sequence until he achieved theCessation of all forms of Consciousness (nirodha samæpatti).(10) Subha SuttaThis is a discourse given not by the Buddha but by his closeattendant, the Venerable Ænanda, on the request of young Subha. TheBuddha had passed away by then. And young Subha wanted to know fromthe lips of the Buddha's close attendant what dhammas were praised by theBuddha and what those dhammas were which he urged people to practise.Ænanda told him that the Buddha had words of praise for the threeaggregates of dhamma, namely, the aggregate of morality, the aggregate ofconcentration and the aggregate of knowledge. The Buddha urged peopleto practice these dhammas, dwell in them, and have them firmly estab-lished. Ænanda explained these aggregates of dhamma in great detail toyoung Subha, in consequence of which he became a devoted lay disciple.(11) Keva¥¥a SuttaThe Buddha was residing at Næ¹andæ in Pæværika's mango grove.A devoted lay disciple approached the Buddha and urged him to let one"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"47of his disciples perform miracles so that the City of Næ¹andæ wouldbecome ever so much devoted to the Buddha.The Buddha told him about the three kinds of miracles which hehad known and realized by himself through supernormal knowledge. Thefirst miracle, iddhi pæ¥ihæriya, was rejected by the Buddha because itcould be mistaken as the black art called Gandhærø magic. The Buddhaalso rejected the second miracle, ædesanæ pæ¥ihæriya which might bemistaken as practice of Cintæmani charm. He recommended theperformance of the third miracle, the anusænsanø pæ¥ihæriya, the miracleof the power of the Teaching as it involved practice in Morality,Concentration and Knowledge leading finally to the Extinction ofÆsavas, Æsavakkhaya Ñæ¼a.(12) Lohicca SuttaThe discourse lays down three types of blameworthy teachers:(i) The teacher who is not yet accomplished in the noble practice andteaches pupils who do not listen to him. (ii) The teacher who is not yetaccomplished in the noble practice and teaches pupils who practice asinstructed by him and attain emancipation. (iii) The teacher who is fullyaccomplished in the noble practice and teaches pupils who do not listento him.The praiseworthy teacher is one who has become fullyaccomplished in the three practices of Morality, Concentration andKnowledge and teaches pupils who become fully accomplished like him.(13) Tevijja SuttaTwo brahmin youths Væse¥¥ha and Bhæradvæja came to see theBuddha while he was on a tour through the Kingdom of Kosala. Theywanted the Buddha to settle their dispute as to the correct path that ledstraight to companionship with the Brahmæ. Each one thought only theway shown by his own master was the true one.The Buddha told them that as none of their masters had seen theBrahmæ, they were like a line of blind men each holding on to thepreceding one. Then he showed them the true path that really led to theBrahma realm, namely, the path of morality and concentration, anddevelopment of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy andequanimity towards all sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"48(b) Mahæ Vagga Pæ¹iThe Large DivisionThe ten suttas in this division are some of the most important onesof the Tipi¥aka, dealing with historical, and biographical aspects as wellas the doctrinal aspects of Buddhism. The most famous sutta is theMahæparinibbæna Sutta which gives an account of the last days and thepassing away of the Buddha and the distribution of his relics.Mahæpadæna Sutta deals with brief accounts of the last seven Buddhasand the life story of the Vipassø Buddha. Doctrinally important are thetwo suttas: the Mahænidæna Sutta which explains the Chain of Cause andEffect, and the Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta dealing with the four Methods ofSteadfast Mindfulness and practical aspects of Buddhist meditation.(1) Mahæpadæna SuttaThis discourse was given at Sævatthi to the bhikkhus who wereone day discussing the Buddha's knowledge of past existences. He toldthem about the last seven Buddhas, with a full life story of one of them,the Vipassø Buddha, recalling all the facts of the Buddhas, their socialrank, name, clan, life-span, the pairs of Chief Disciples, the assemblies oftheir followers, their attainments, and emancipation from defilements.The Buddha explained that his ability to remember and recall allthe facts of past existences was due to his own penetrating discernment aswell as due to the devas making these matters known to him.(2) Mahænidæna SuttaThis discourse was given at Kammæsadhamma market town to theVenerable Ænanda to correct his wrong view that the doctrine ofPa¥iccasamuppæda, although having signs of being deep and profound,was apparent and fathomable. The Buddha told him that this doctrine notonly appeared to be deep and profound but was actually deep andprofound on four counts: it was deep in meaning, deep as a doctrine, deepwith respect to the manner in which it was taught, and deep with regardto the facts on which it was established.He then gave a thorough exposition on the doctrine and said thatbecause of lack of proper understanding and penetrative comprehensionof this doctrine, beings were caught in and unable to escape from, themiserable, ruinous round of rebirth. He concluded that without a clear"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"49understanding of this doctrine, even the mind of those, accomplished inthe attainments of jhæna, would be beclouded with ideas of atta.(3) Mahæparinibbæna SuttaThis sutta is an important narrative of the Buddha's last days, adetailed chronicle of what he did, what he said and what happened to himduring the last year of his life. Compiled in a narrative form, it isinterspersed with many discourses on some of the most fundamental andimportant aspects of the Buddha's Teaching. Being the longest discourseof the Døgha Nikæya, it is divided into six chapters.On the eve of the last great tour, the Buddha while staying atRæjagaha gave the famous discourses on seven factors of Non-decline ofkings and princes and seven factors of Non-decline of the bhikkhus.Then he set out on his last journey going first to the village ofPæ¥ali where he taught on the consequences of an immoral and a morallife. He then proceeded to the village of Ko¥i where he expounded on theFour Noble Truths. Then the Buddha took up his residence at the villageof Nætika where the famous discourse on the Mirror of Truth was given.Next the Buddha went to Vesælø with a large company ofbhikkhus. At Vesælø he accepted the park offered by the CourtesanAmbapæ¹ø. From Vesælø, the Buddha travelled to a small village namedVe¹uva where he was overtaken by a severe illness that could haveproved fatal. But the Buddha resolved to maintain the life-process andnot to pass away without addressing his lay disciples and without takingleave of the Saμgha. When Ænanda informed the Buddha how worriedhe had been because of the Buddha's illness, the Buddha gave the famousinjunction: \"Let yourselves be your own support, your own refuge. Letthe Dhamma, not anything else, be your refuge.\"It was at Vesælø that the Buddha made the decision to pass awayand realize parinibbæna in three months' time. Upon his making thismomentous decision, there was great earthquake. Ænanda, on learningfrom the Buddha the reason of the earthquake, supplicated him to changethe decision, but to no avail.The Buddha then caused the Saμgha to be assembled to whom heannounced his approaching parinibbæna. He then went over all the funda-mental principles of his Teaching and exhorted them to be vigilant, alert,and to watch over one's own mind so as to make an end of suffering."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"50The Buddha then left Vesælø and went to Bhanða Village wherehe continued to give his discourses to the accompanying Saμgha on søla,samædhi and paññæ. Proceeding further on his journey to the north, hegave the discourse on the four great Authorities, Mahæpadesa, at the townof Bhoga.From there he went on to Pævæ and stayed in the Mango Grove ofCunda, the Goldsmith's son, who made an offering of food to the Buddhaand his community of bhikkhus. After eating the meal offered by Cunda,a severe illness came upon the Buddha who nevertheless continued on hisjourney till he reached Kusinæræ where in the Sal Grove of the Mallaprinces he urged Ænanda to lay out the couch for him. He lay down onthe couch with mindfulness and deliberation, awaiting the hour of hisparinibbæna.Even on his death-bed the Buddha continued to teach, explainingthat there are four places which arouse reverence and devotion, fourpersons worthy of a stupa, and answering Ænanda's questions on how toconduct oneself with regard to women, or on what should be doneregarding the remains of the Buddha. His last act of selflessness was toexpound the Truth and show the Path to Subhadda, the wandering ascetic.Then after ascertaining that there was not a single bhikkhu whohad perplexity or doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha,the Buddha uttered his last words: \"Inherent in all compounded things isdecay and dissolution. Strive well with full mindfulness.\"Then as the assembled bhikkhus, princes and people paid homageto him with deep reverence, the Buddha passed away, realizingparinibbæna.(4) Mahæsudassana SuttaThis discourse was given by the Buddha while he was lying onhis death-bed in the Sal Grove of the Mallas. When Ænanda imploredhim not to realize parinibbæna in an insignificant, barren, small town, theBuddha told him that Kusinæræ was not an insignificant, small place. Intimes long past, it was known as Kusævatø, the capital city of UniversalMonarchs who ruled over the four quarters of the world.The Buddha then described the magnificence and grandeur ofKusævatø when King Mahæsudassana was the ruler there. He also toldhow the King ruled over his dominions righteously and how finally"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"51abandoning all attachments and practicing jhæna he passed away andreached the blissful Brahma realm.The Buddha revealed that he himself was King Mahæsudassana ofthat time. He had cast off the body in this place (former Kusævati) for sixtimes as a Universal Monarch. Now he was casting it off for the seventhand last time. He ended the discourse reminding Ænanda that allcompounded things are indeed impermanent. Arising and decaying aretheir inherent nature. Only their ultimate cessation is blissful Nibbæna.(5) Janavasabha SuttaThis discourse is an extension of another discourse delivered bythe Buddha on his last Journey. Ænanda wanted to know the destinies oflay disciples from the country of Magadha. The Buddha told him thatinnumerable persons from Magadha had reached the deva world by virtueof their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha. Thisinformation was given him by Janavasabha Deva who was formerly KingBimbisæra. He informed the Buddha that there were regular assemblies ofdevas in the deva realm on uposatha days when the king of the devas andSana³kumæra Brahmæ taught the Dhamma on development of the Basesof Psychic Power, on the Three Opportunities, on the Four Methods ofSteadfast Mindfulness and the Seven Accessories of Concentration.(6) Mahægovinda SuttaIn this discourse, Pañcasikha, a gandhabba deva, told the deva assemblywhere Sana³kumæra Brahmæ taught the Dhamma as shown byMahægovinda, the Bodhisatta who had reached the Brahmæ world. TheBuddha said that Mahægovinda was none other than himself andexplained that the Dhamma he taught at that time could lead one only tothe Brahmæ World. With his Teaching now as Enlightened Buddha,higher attainments such as the Sotæpatti, Sakadægæmi, Anægæmi and thehighest achievement Arahatta phala were possible.(7) Mahæsamaya SuttaThe Buddha was residing in the Mahævana forest at Kapilavatthuwith a company of Arahats numbering five hundred. Then devas andBrahmæs from ten thousand Cakkava¹as came to see the Buddha and thecommunity of bhikkhus. The Buddha told his disciples the names of thedevas and Brahmæs as listed in this sutta."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"52(8) Sakkapañha SuttaOnce when the Buddha was residing at the Indasæla Cave nearRæjagaha, Sakka, the king of devas, came to him to ask certain questions.He wanted to know why there was hostility and violence among variousbeings. The Buddha told him it was envy and selfishness that broughtabout hostility among beings. He further explained that envy and selfish-ness were caused by likes and dislikes, which in turn had their roots indesire. And desire grew from mental preoccupation (vitakka) which hadits origin in saμsæra-expanding illusions (papañca-saññæ-sa³kha).The Buddha then gave an outline of practices to remove thesesaμsæra-expanding illusions including two types of quests, quests thatshould be pursued and quests that should not be pursued.(9) Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna SuttaThis sutta is one of the most important doctrinal discourses of theBuddha. It propounds the only way 'for the purification of beings, forovercoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete removal of painand grief, for the attainment of the right path, and for the realization ofNibbæna.' This discourse, given directly to the bhikkhus at the markettown of Kammæsadhamma, defines 'the only way' as the Four Methodsof Steadfast Mindfulness made up of fourteen ways of contemplating thebody, nine ways of contemplating sensation, sixteen ways of contemplat-ing the mind, and five ways of contemplating the dhamma. It ends with adefinite assurance of fruitful results: Arahatship in this very existence orthe state of an anægæmø within seven years, seven months or seven days.(10) Pæyæsi SuttaThis discourse recounts how the Venerable Kumærakassapashowed the right path to Governor Pæyæsi of Setabyæ town in Kosalacountry. Governor Pæyæsi held the wrong belief: \"There is no otherworld; no beings arise again after death; there are no consequences ofgood or bad deeds.\" The Venerable Kumærakassapa showed him the rightpath, illustrating his teaching with numerous illuminating similes.Ultimately Pæyæsi became full of faith and took refuge in the Buddha, theDhamma and the Saμgha. The Venerable Kumærakassapa taught himalso the right kind of offerings to be made and that these offerings shouldbe made with due respect, by one's own hands, with due esteem and notas if discarding them. Only under these conditions would the good deedof offerings bear splendid fruits."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"53(c) Pæthika Vagga Pæ¹iThis division is made up of eleven shorter discourses of amiscellaneous nature. They deal with the Buddha's rejection of wrongand severe asceticism practised by followers of many sects; they deal alsowith the periodical evolution and dissolution of the universe, the accountsof Universal Monarchs and the thirty-two physiognomic characteristicsof a great man. There is one discourse, Si³gæla Sutta, addressed to ayoung brahmin showing the duties to be performed by members of thehuman society. The last two suttas, Sa³gøti and Dasuttara, are discoursesgiven by the Venerable Særiputta and they contain lists of doctrinal termsclassified according to subject matter and numerical units. The style oftheir composition is different from the other nine suttas of the division.(1) Pæthika SuttaAt the time of the Buddha, there were many other teachers withtheir own disciples, holding different views on what constituted the holylife, on the origin and development of the universe, and on theperformance of wonders and miracles. Sunakkhatta, a Licchvø prince,became a disciple of the Buddha and was admitted into the Order.But he found the discipline and the Teaching to be beyond himand his comprehension; he became at the same time attracted to theteachings and practices of other sects. He left the Order after three years.Then becoming a follower of one of the sects he began to disparage theteachings of the Buddha, and made slanderous attacks on the Buddha andhis disciples. In Pæthika Sutta are short discourses in which are accountsof the Buddha's refutation and explanation with reference to many ofSunakkhatta's accusations.(2) Udumbarika SuttaThis discourse was given to Nigrodha the wandering ascetic andhis followers in the Park of the Queen Udumbarikæ near Ræjagaha, inorder to destroy their wrong doctrine and establish wholesome doctrine.So obsessed were the wandering ascetics with their own wrong beliefsthat they gave no response to the Buddha's invitation to follow hisTeaching assuring them fruitful results within seven days."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"54(3) Cakkavatti SuttaIn the town of Mætulæ, in the country of Magadha, bhikkhus wereenjoined by the Buddha to be their own support, their own refuge; relyingonly on the Dhamma and not on any other refuge. Then the Buddha toldthem the story of Dalhanemi, the Universal Monarch, who possessed theCelestial Wheel as one of his seven treasures. He and his successor ruledover the four continents, wielding the power and authority of theUniversal Monarch. Their life-span was long and as long as theyremained righteous and fulfilled the noble duties of Universal Monarch,making the Dhamma their only support, providing shelter and security,offering wealth and necessities to the needy, their dominions remained atpeace, prosperous and progressing.But when the Monarch failed to fulfill the noble duties of arighteous king, when the Dhamma was no longer held as a refuge, moralityof the people declines. The life-span dwindled down to ten years only. Thenten meritorious deeds productive of wholesome effects completelydisappeared and ten evil deeds giving unwholesome results flourishedexceedingly. People failed to show reverential regard for the leaders andelders, to fulfil their duties towards parents, sama¼as and bræhma¼as. Therealso developed intense mutual aversion, ill will, thoughts of killing oneanother, followed by fighting, devastation and carnage.A few who survived the holocaust agreed to give up their evilways, to live in a spirit of harmony, doing good deeds, showingreverential regard for the leaders and elders, fulfilling their duties towardsparents, sama¼as and bræhma¼as. In consequence of improved morality,their life-span expanded again until it reached eighty thousand yearswhen a Universal Monarch appeared once more to rule righteously.Bhikkhus were thus enjoined to keep within the confines of the Dhamma,making it their support, their refuge. The Dhamma would show the wayfor their physical and mental development until they attained Arahatship.(4) Aggañña SuttaThis discourse was given at Sævatthi to two novices undertraining, Væse¥¥ha and Bhæradvæja, pointing out the wrong beliefs ofbrahmins as regards caste.

For making this bold utterance on the virtues of theBuddha, the Buddha asked him whether he had personal knowledge ofthe minds of all the Buddhas, those of the past, of the future and of thepresent, their Morality, their Concentration, their Wisdom, and themanner of their emancipation.The Venerable Særiputta said he did not claim to have suchknowledge but justified himself by stating in detail the course of theDhamma taken by all the Buddhas — their accomplishment in søla,abandonment of five hindrances, establishment in the four Methods ofSteadfast Mindfulness and cultivation of the Seven Factors ofEnlightenment — the only course that could lead to unsurpassedSupreme Enlightenment.(6) Pæsædika SuttaThe Venerable Ænanda accompanied by bhikkhu Cunda went tosee the Buddha to give him the news about the death of Niga¼¥haNæ¥aputta, the leader of a well-known sect, and the schism that had arisenamongst his disciples.The Buddha told them that it was natural and to be expected tohappen in a Teaching which was not well taught, not well imparted, notconducive to emancipation, and not taught by one who was supremelyenlightened."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"56In contrast, the Buddha explained that when the Teaching waswell taught, well imparted by one who was supremely enlightened, therewere no wrong views, no speculations about past or future or about atta.In the Teaching of the Buddha, bhikkhus were taught the Four Methodsof Steadfast Mindfulness by which wrong views and speculations werelaid aside.(7) Lakkha¼a SuttaThis discourse on thirty-two bodily marks of a great man wasgiven by the Buddha at Sævatthi, in the Anæthapi¼ðika's Monastery.

The youth Si³gæla used toworship the six cardinal points, namely, the East, the South, the West, theNorth, the Nadir and the Zenith in obedience to the last advice given byhis dying father. The Buddha explained to the young man that according tohis Teaching, the six directions were: The East standing for parents; TheSouth standing for teachers; The West standing for the wife and children;The North standing for friends and associates; The Nadir standing forservants, employees; The Zenith standing for sama¼as, bræhma¼as.The Buddha explained further that the six social groupsmentioned in the discourse were to be regarded as sacred and worthy ofrespect and worship.

The death of Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta had taken place onlyrecently and his followers were left in dissension and strife, wranglingover doctrines.The Venerable Særiputta who delivered this discourse attributedthis schism among Næ¥aputta's followers to the fact that Næ¥aputta'sTeaching had not been well taught nor well imparted, and was notconducive to release from the round of existences, being taught by onewho was not supremely enlightened.But the Buddha's Teaching was well taught, well imparted,conducive to release from the round of existences, being taught by theBuddha who was supremely enlightened. He advised the bhikkhus torecite the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha, in concord and withoutdissension so that the teaching should last long.

The uninstructed worldling cannot perceive the true nature ofthese phenomena; only the enlightened ones can see them in trueperspective.(2) Sabbæsava SuttaIn this discourse, mental intoxicants that beset the uninstructedworldling are defined, and seven practices for eradicating them are explained.(3) Dhammadæyæda SuttaThis sutta contains two separate discourses, the first one givenby the Buddha, the second by the Venerable Særiputta. The Buddha urgedthe bhikkhus to receive as their legacy from him the BodhipakkhiyaDhamma only, and not material things like the four requisites.

Only the clean cloth will absorb dye; so also only the puremind will retain the dhamma.(8) Sallekha SuttaIn this discourse the Buddha explained to Mahæ Cunda howwrong views about atta and loka can be removed only by vipassanæinsight. Jhænic practice is not the austerity practice that removes moraldefilements; jhænic practice only leads to a blissful existence.Only refraining from forty-four kinds of bad deeds constitutesausterity practice for removing moral defilements.

The example of acowherd is given. When a cowherd is equipped with eleven skills ofmanaging and tending his cattle, there is progress and growth in his work.So also when the bhikkhu is skilled and accomplished in eleven factorssuch as knowledge of truth about the khandhas, practice of søla, samædhiand paññæ etc., the Teaching will grow and prosper.(4) Cþ¹agopælaka SuttaThis discourse deals with eleven factors, the failure to fulfil whichwould contribute to the downfall and ruin of the Teaching.

Saccaka maintained that rþpa, vedanæ, saññæ, sa³khæra and viññæ¼awere one's atta. It was atta which enjoyed the fruits of good deeds andsuffered the consequences of bad deeds. The Buddha refuted his theory,pointing out that none of the khandhas was atta, each being subjected tothe laws of anicca, dukkha, and anatta, and not amenable to anyone'scontrol.

Out of gratitude for such support, the Buddha urged thebhikkhus to make strenuous efforts in their training and practice ofDhamma, gradually going up stage by stage: starting from avoiding evildeeds by restraint of physical and vocal actions, to proceed to mentalrestraint through meditation, then progressing towards attainment of fourstages of jhæna, and finally to the stage where all moral defilements wereeliminated and Nibbæna was attained."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"68(10) Cþ¹a-assapura SuttaOut of gratitude for the support given by the lay devotees ofAssapura, a market town in the country of A³ga, the Buddha urged thebhikkhus to be worthy of the name of sama¼a and bræhma¼a.

Whatever view one may hold about them,there would still be birth, ageing, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,grief, distress. The Buddha said that he taught only about dukkha, thecause of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha and the way leading to thecessation of dukkha.(4) Mahæmælukya SuttaThis discourse was given to bhikkhu Mælukya at Sævatthi toexplain the five fetters, namely, personality belief, doubt, attachment towrong practice, sensual desires and ill will, which lead beings to lowerdestinations.(5) Bhaddæli SuttaThis discourse, given at Sævatthi, is an exhortation to bhikkhuBhaddæli who refused to obey the disciplinary rule of not eating aftermidday and in the evening; the Buddha explained why bhikkhus in theTeaching should respect the disciplinary rules laid down by him.(6) La¥ukikopama SuttaThis discourse was given to the Venerable Udæyi in connectionwith observance of disciplinary rules and precepts. When the fivestrengths (balas), namely, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration andinsight are not well developed, the bhikkhu finds even a paltry restraintlike refraining from eating meals in the afternoon and in the evening veryirksome and onerous.

The five hundredbhikkhus made a lot of noise while settling down. The Buddha refused tosee them at first, but later relented and taught them the dangers in the lifeof a bhikkhu. Just as there are dangers and hazards in a sea like stormywaves, crocodiles, whirlpools, and sharks, so also there are dangersagainst which the bhikkhu must be always on guard, namely, ill willagainst those who instruct them and guide them; dissatisfaction withtraining rules such as those concerning taking of meals or dealing withwomenfolk; and pleasures of senses.(8) Na¹akapæna SuttaThis discourse was given to the Venerable Anuruddha and to thevillagers of Na¹akapæna to explain that unless a bhikkhu had attained thehigher stages of Magga and Phala, accomplishments in supernormalpsychic powers may prove to be harmful to him.

Then he explained to him the dhamma in some detail.(3) Mahævaccha SuttaThis discourse was given by the Buddha to Vacchagotta atRæjagaha. On his Visit to the Buddha after a long interval, Vacchagottano longer troubled the Buddha with his speculations about atta, loka, etc.;instead, he requested to be taught on good and bad deeds (KusalækusalaμKammaμ) in brief.

Mæga¼ðiya gave up his wrongviews to become a disciple of the Buddha.(6) Sandaka SuttaThis discourse was given at Kosambø to Sandaka, the wanderingascetic, and his followers by the Venerable Ænanda. The VenerableÆnanda explained to them the four wrong views of sect-leaders who heldthere was no existence after death, that there was no evil nor good, nocause for any phenomena, and that there were only aggregates of sevenelements.

The Buddha rejected Udæyø'senumeration of his virtues which were mostly attributed to asceticpractices, and explained to him the real cause of the total venerationbestowed on him by his followers.(8) Sama¼amu¼ðika SuttaThe wandering ascetic Uggahamana, son of Sama¼amu¼ðika, wasteaching that any recluse who refrained from wrong deed, wrong word,wrong thought, and wrong livelihood was a fully accomplished Arahat.The Buddha rejected his assertion, saying that in that case, even an infantsleeping innocently upon his bed could claim to Arahatship.

There was also the account of howGha¥ikæra forcibly pulled along his friend, young Jotipæla, to whereKassapa Buddha was, to pay respect. After hearing the dhammadiscourses young Jotipæla left the household life to be admitted into theOrder by Kassapa Buddha. This interesting ancient episode that hadhappened in Kassapa Buddha's time many aeons ago was recounted tothe Venerable Ænanda by Gotama Buddha standing on the very spotwhere once stood, a long, long time ago, the house of Gha¥ikhæra, thepotter.

TheBuddha told the Venerable Ænanda about the noble tradition laid downby the righteous King Maghadeva. When his hair began to turn white, hegave up the household life leaving his dominions to his eldest son.

He refuted the brahmins' claim that only brahmins were nobleand superior, and that others were inferior. He explained to KingMadhura that it was one's morality, not birth that established one'snobility. Anyone whether Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa or Sudda, committ-ing a wrong deed would be born again in the states of woe; anyone doinga good deed would be born again in a happy realm.

The Buddha said he had also oncethought in a similar manner, and recounted the whole story of hisrenunciation, his struggles with wrong practices, frantic search for theTruth, and ultimate enlightenment. When asked by the prince how longwould it take a bhikkhu to achieve, in this very lifetime, the supreme goalof the holy life, Arahatship, the Buddha stipulated five attributes for theaspiring bhikkhu. If he was equipped with five attributes: faith, goodhealth, integrity (not being deceitful), unrelenting zeal, and sufficientintellect to understand the phenomena of 'arising and passing away', andhaving the Tathægata as his instructor and guide, a bhikkhu wouldachieve the Arahatship within seven years at most.

The householder was displeased withwhat the Buddha said. Gamblers playing with dice just close by theBuddha's monastery told him differently. They said that loved onessurely brought joy and happiness. King Pasenadi concurred with thegamblers but his queen Mallikæ maintained that only what the Buddhasaid must be true. She justified her faith in the Buddha by giving manyillustrations of the Buddha's penetrating and illuminating wisdom.

In this sutta too the Buddha rejected the brahminclassification of society into four classes claiming the highest position forthe brahmins. It was not only the brahmins who could develop loving-kindness, free from enmity and ill will. Members of other classes alsocould develop loving-kindness. It was not birth but the practice ofwholesome dhamma that made a person noble.(7) Dhanañjæni SuttaDhanañjæni was an old devoted lay disciple of the Buddha. Afterthe death of his first wife who had great faith in the Buddha, the Dhammaand the Saμgha, he was no longer diligent in and mindful of the practiceof dhamma.

When these bhikkhus informed the Buddha about the aura(obhæsa) and vision (dassana) of various shapes and forms they perceivedin the course of their meditation, the Buddha taught them aboutUpakkilesa, mental defilements, that appear at a certain stage inmeditation process. They should be on their guard not to be led astray bythese deceptive defilements.(9) Bælapa¼ðita SuttaThis discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi on fools andcharacteristic behaviour of fools; on how evil thoughts, words and deedsof fools harm themselves and others; and on how these evil actions leadfools to states of misery and woe. The utter wretchedness and intensesuffering in such states beggar description. Once a fool, through his evilactions, found himself in one of the nether regions, there was very littlelikelihood for him to rise again to the upper realms. The chances aremore remote than that of a blind turtle to get his head through a singlehole in a yoke which was being tossed about in a stormy sea.The discourse deals also with the wise and their characteristics; thewholesome thoughts, words and deeds of the wise, the wholesome effectsresulting from such meritorious actions and bliss enjoyed by them in therealms of happiness.(10) Devadþta SuttaThis is a discourse on evil results arising from evil action, givingdetails of suffering in realms of misery and woe.IV. Viba³ga Vagga(1) Bhaddekaratta SuttaThis sutta which means 'a discourse on a night of good meditation'gives a detailed description of Vipassanæ meditation. The Buddha urgedthe bhikkhus not to dwell in the past which was gone, nor to seek thefuture which was unattained yet, but to perceive the dhamma in thephenomena presently occurring, at the same time not becoming involvedin and attached to them."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"91(2) Ænanda-bhaddekaratta SuttaThis is a discourse in which the Venerable Ænanda repeated to thebhikkhus the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, for which performance he was highlycommended by the Buddha.(3) Mahækaccæna-bhaddekaratta SuttaThis is a detailed exposition by the Venerable Mahækaccæna onVipassanæ meditation of the five khandhas as explained by the Buddha inthe Bhaddekaratta Sutta.

The Buddha gave along discourse on kamma and its resultant effects. Deeds, words andthoughts have endless consequences of joy and sorrow to be experiencedin this very life and hereafter. Men depend on their own deeds andnothing else for their condition and status in life.(6) Mahækamma-vibha³ga SuttaThis is another discourse on kamma and its resultant effects whichare most difficult to foresee.

The Venerable Kaccæna gave anexposition on this subject which earned him praise from the Buddha.(9) Ara¼a-vibha³ga SuttaThis discourse is an exhortation on the practice of the Middle Path,avoiding the two extremes of indulgence in sensual pleasures andpractice of self-mortification, and on modes of conduct, not indulging inbackbiting; not keeping to colloquial vocabulary only and not spurningthe conventional usage of the language, but speaking gently, slowly.(10) Dhætu-vibha³ga SuttaThis is an important discourse taught to Pukkusæti, a recluse whohad left the homelife inspired by the fame of Gotama Buddha whom hehad not yet met and whom he was on his way to see. The Buddha wentpurposely to meet this recluse in a potter's hut to teach this discourse: Aman is made up of six elements, namely, solidity, fluidity, heat, motion,space and consciousness. On analysis, none of these elements is found tobe 'mine' or 'me' or 'my self '. All of them are subject to the law ofimpermanence, so are the three types of sensation.

He then urged thebhikkhus to seek guidance from the two theras, the Venerable Særiputtaand the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna, likening the Venerable Særiputta toa mother and the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna to a foster-mother.

The Buddha urged his foster-mother to make theoffering to the Saμgha, the community of bhikkhus. He enumeratedfourteen kinds of donations to individuals and seven kinds of donations tothe Saμgha, explaining the superior benefit accruing from offeringsmade to the Saμgha.V. Sa¹æyatana Vagga(1) Anæthapi¼ðikovæda SuttaThis discourse was given by the Venerable Særiputta toAnæthapi¼ðika on his death-bed. The Venerable Særiputta enjoined himnot to grasp at the six internal sense bases, nor the six external sensebases, nor the feelings that arise in relation to them, nor at the sixelements (including space and consciousness), nor at the five aggregates,nor the realms of Infinite Space, of Infinite Consciousness, ofNothingness, of Neither Consciousness Nor Non-Consciousness.

Each major vagga is dividedinto fifty-six groups known as saμyuttas — related subjects groupedtogether. The saμyuttas are named after the subjects they deal with, forexample, Bojjha³ga Saμyutta on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, orafter some principal personalities such as the Venerable Særiputta, KingPasenadi of Kosala, or Sakka. Kosala Saμyutta is a group of discoursesconcerning King Pasenadi of Kosala, and Devata Saμyutta deals withdevas like Sakka, Indra, Brahmæ, etc. Each saμyutta is further dividedinto sections which are made up of individual suttas. Thus the well-known Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is the first discourse (sutta) in thesecond section of Sacca Saμyutta which comes under the Mahævaggadivision of Saμyutta Nikæya. In the following excerpts from SaμyuttaNikæya, only a few suttas representing each major division are given.(a) Sagæthæ Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹iThis major division of Sagæthæ Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹i contains elevensaμyuttas with discourses grouped according to characters appearing inthem, the king of devas, the devas, the Brahmæ, Mæra, King of Kosala,bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs. The name of the Vagga, Sagæthæ, is derivedfrom the fact that various personalities appearing in the discoursesconducted their dialogues or interviews with the Buddha mostly in verse.Devatæ SaμyuttaOn the request of a Brahmæ, the Buddha explains in the Oghatara¼aSutta of this saμyutta that he crosses over the flood of sensuous desire, ofexistence, of wrong views and of ignorance neither by remaininginactive, nor by making strenuous efforts. By remaining inactive he willbe sucked into the whirlpool; by making frantic efforts he will be sweptaway in the current of the flood. He follows a middle course."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"97The Buddha also teaches in other suttas of this saμyutta that allbeings are entangled in the mesh of attachments brought about by sixinternal sense bases and six external sense objects. The way to escapefrom these entanglements is to become established in søla, to developConcentration Meditation and Insight Meditation in order to be fullyaccomplished in the higher knowledge of liberation.Until one becomes fully developed in the knowledge of the Path,tanhæ can still give rise to rebirth. This fact is borne out by the story of adeva named Sama¼a, given in Accharæ Sutta. A certain young manhaving faith in the Teaching of the Buddha gets himself admitted into theOrder. Then taking a meditation subject of his choice, he repairs to asolitary abode in the forest and devotes himself incessantly to the practiceof meditation.His efforts at meditation are very strenuous. Thus striving day andnight and getting enervated by lack of sufficient nourishing food, he issuddenly seized with a paralytic stroke which causes him instant death.Although he has put in a great deal of effort in the practice of meditation,he passes away without even attaining the stage of Sotæpanna, theStream-winner.Because of tanhæ which he has not yet eradicated, he has to gothrough the round of existences again; but in consequence of the merit hehas acquired in the practice of meditation, a magnificent celestial palaceawaits him in the celestial abode of the Tævatiμsa.By spontaneous manifestation, he appears as if just awakened fromsleep, at the entrance of the palace, a celestial being resplendent in fullcelestial attire. He does not realize that he has taken a new existence in anew world. He thinks he is still a bhikkhu of the human world. Thecelestial maidens, who are awaiting his arrival, bring a body-lengthmirror and place it in front of the deva. On seeing his reflection in themirror, he finally realizes that he has left the bhikkhus' existence and hasarisen in the celestial realm.The Sama¼a Deva is greatly perturbed then. He reflects that he hastaken up meditation not to be reborn in the celestial land but to attain thegoal of Arahatta Fruition. So without entering the palatial building, herepairs hastily to the presence of the Buddha. He asks of the Buddha howto avoid, and proceed past the Mohana garden, the Tævatiμsa celestialabode, full of celestial maidens who to him appear as demons. TheBuddha advises him that the straight path for a quick escape is the NoblePath of Eight Constituents using the two-wheeler Vipassanæ carriage,fitted with the two wheels of physical exertion and mental exertion."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"98While the Buddha is teaching the Dhamma in three verses, Sama¼a Devais able to develop quickly successive Vipassanæ Ñæ¼as step by step untilhe attains the first Path and Fruition.Devaputta SaμyuttaIn Rohitassa Sutta of this saμyutta, Rohitassa Deva comes to theBuddha with another problem. He tells the Buddha that he was in aformer existence a hermit endowed with supernormal psychic powerwhich enabled him to traverse throughout the universe with immensespeed. He had travelled with that speed for over one hundred years toreach the end of the world but he did not succeed. He wants to knowwhether it would be possible to know or see or reach the end of the worldwhere there is no birth nor death by travelling there. The Buddha says hedoes not declare that there is a world's end where there is no birth nordeath to be known or seen or reached by travelling there. Yet he does notsay that there is an ending of suffering without reaching Nibbæna. It is inthe fathom long body of oneself with its perception and its mind that theBuddha describes the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of theworld and the way leading to the cessation of the world. The Buddha'sway leading to the cessation of the world is the Noble Path of EightConstituents.Kosala SaμyuttaIn this saμyutta are interesting suttas which describe frequentmeetings of the Buddha with King Pasenadi of Kosala. The king hasheard of the fame of the Buddha from his queen Mallikæ but has not yetmet him. But when at last he meets the Buddha as described in theDahara Sutta, he puts a direct question whether the Venerable Gotamaclaims to have attained the Supreme Enlightenment. He says that thereare other religious teachers such as Pþra¼a Kassapa, Makkhali Gosæla,Nigap¥ha Næ¥aputta, Sañcaya, Pakudha and Ajita, with their own order,with their own followers, who are much older than the Buddha and aregenerally regarded to be Arahats. Even these teachers do not make claimto Supreme Enlightenment.The Buddha replies that if it can be rightly said of anyone to haveattained the Supreme Enlightenment, then it is only of himself that it can"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"99rightly be said. The Buddha adds that there are four things that should notbe looked down upon and despised because they are young. They are ayoung prince, a serpent, a fire and a bhikkhu. A young prince of nobleparentage should not be despised. He might one day become a powerfulruler and wreak royal vengeance. A writhing snake moves very fast; itmight attack and bite a heedless man. A small fire, when heedlesslyignored might grow in intensity and cause untold damage. A man treatinga virtuous bhikkhu with contempt might bring upon himselfunwholesome results such as dwindling prosperity and lack of offspringto inherit from him.Dutiya Aputtaka Sutta describes another occasion when KingPasenadi calls on the Buddha after he has just taken over an immenseaccumulation of wealth belonging to a multi-millionaire who has diedrecently. The dead man has left behind treasure worth over one hundredlakhs which, in the absence of any heirs to claim, becomes the king'sproperty. The king reports that the dead millionaire was a great miser, aniggardly person, begrudging even to himself the luxury of comfortableliving. He wore only very rough, thread-bare clothes, eating poor, coarsefood and travelled about in an old, roofless rickety carriage.The Buddha confirms that what the king says about the millionaireis quite true and tells the king the reason for the millionaire's miserliness.In one of his past existences, he met a Paccekabuddha going round foralms-food. He gave permission to his family to offer food to thePaccekabuddha and went out to attend to some business. On his wayback, he met the Paccekabuddha whom he asked whether he had beengiven any alms-food by his family, and looked into the bowl. On seeingthe delicious food in the bowl, an unwholesome thought suddenly arosein his mind that it would have been more profitable to feed his servantswith such food than to give it away to a Paccekabuddha.For his good deed of allowing his family to make the offering to aPaccekabuddha he was reborn in the deva world seven times and becamea millionaire seven times in the human world. But as a result of the illthought he had entertained in that previous existence he never had theinclination to live a luxurious life enjoying fine clothes, good food, andriding in comfortable carriages.The millionaire has now exhausted the good as well as the badeffects of his thoughts and actions with regard to the offering of food tothe Paccekabuddha. But unfortunately he has to face the consequences ofa more serious evil deed, that of causing the death of his own nephew in apast existence."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"100The Buddha tells the king that he is therefore reborn, after his deathin the human world, in the state of the most intense suffering,Mahæroruva.Bræhma¼a SaμyuttaMany brahmins of Bhæradvæja clan become devoted disciples of theBuddha, ultimately attaining Arahatship. At first, all of them are quiteunfriendly, if not openly hostile. Bhæradvæja Gotta, mentioned inDhanañjænø Sutta, is such a brahmin. Although his wife Dhanañjænø is adisciple of the Buddha, very much devoted to his Teaching, BhæradvæjaGotta and his brahmin teachers show great contempt for the Buddha andhis Teaching.On one occasion when Bhæradvæja is giving a feast to his brahminteachers, his wife while in the course of waiting upon these brahminsslips accidentally and, as she tries to regain her balance, blurts out threetimes in excitement the formula of adoration to the Buddha: 'Namo TassaBhagavato Arahato Sammæsambuddhassa'. Upon hearing the word'Buddha', the brahmin teachers rise up from their seats and run awayhelter-skelter in all directions just like a flock of crows in whose midst astone has been thrown.Telling his wife in a fury that he would defeat the Buddha in acontest of doctrines, Bhæradvæja goes to see the Buddha. The interviewends up with Bhæradvæja asking the Buddha's permission to enter hisOrder. He finally attains to Arahatship.Akkosa Sutta mentions about Bhæradvæja Gotta's younger brotherAkkosaka Bhæradvæja, who on hearing that his elder brother has joinedthe Buddha's Order is highly exasperated. Raging with fury, he stormsinto the presence of the Buddha whom he reviles and reproaches in themost vulgar, offensive, obscene, foul language.Very calmly and with great compassion the Buddha asks the youngBhæradvæja if he ever has given gifts to friends and relatives. When theyoung Bhæradvæja replies that he indeed has made offers of gifts to hisfriends and relatives, the Buddha asks him, \"What happens to the gifts ifyour friends and relatives do not accept them?\"\"Well then they remain with me as my own property,\" repliesBhæradvæja."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"101Then the Buddha says, \"You have heaped abusive language on uswho have not uttered a single word of abuse to you; you have been veryoffensive and quarrelsome with us who do not offend you nor quarrelwith you.

They remain with you as your ownproperty.\"Taken by surprise by this unexpected reaction, Bhæradvæja isfrightened with the thought that this might be a recluse's method ofcasting a spell on him by way of retaliation. He asks the Buddha if he isangry with him for his rude behaviour. The Buddha states that he haslong left anger behind. Being free from all mental defilements how couldhe take offence with him! To meet anger with anger is to sink lower thanthe original reviler. He is the conqueror who wins a hard won battle bynot retaliating anger with anger.At the end of the discourse, Akkosaka Bhæradvæja, the youngerbrother, also leaves homelife to join the Buddha's Order. In time, he toobecomes accomplished in higher knowledge and attains to Arahatship.In Kasi Bhæradvæja Sutta is an account of the Buddha's encounterwith the brahmin Kasi Bhæradvæja who is a rich landowner.It is sowing time and Kasi Bhæradvæja is preparing to startploughing operations with five hundred ploughs. It is made an auspiciousoccasion with distribution of food and with festivities. The Buddha goesto where food is being distributed and stands at one side. KasiBhæradvæja, seeing him waiting for food, says to him, \"I plough, sama¼a,and I sow. Having ploughed and sown, I eat. You too, sama¼a, shouldplough and sow; having ploughed and sown, you shall eat.\"The Buddha replies, \"I too plough, brahmin, and I sow, and havingploughed and sown, I eat.\"\"We see no yoke or plough or pole or oxen of yours. Yet you claimto be a ploughman. How do you explain yourself?\" asks the brahmin.\"The faith which I have had since the time of Sumedhæ, the hermit,is the seed. It will grow to hear the fruit of Nibbæna. The søla with which Ikeep control of my sense doors is the rain. The two kinds of knowledge,mundane and supramundane, I possess are my plough and yoke. Sense ofshame for doing evil and fear of evil deeds are the pole and the handle ofthe plough. My energy is the ox, and my concentration is the rope withwhich I put the ox to the yoke.

The Sakka himself shows respect and makesobeisance not only to sama¼as who have lived their holy life without anybreach of moral conduct for many years but also to the lay disciples ofthe Buddha who are well established in their faith and who have donemeritorious deeds of giving charity, observing the Five, the Eight or theTen Precepts, and dutifully maintaining their families.(b) Nidæna Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹iThis second major division of Nidæna Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹icontains ten saμyuttas, all dealing, with fundamental aspects of thedoctrine. The discourses are chiefly concerned with the principles ofconditionality and interdependence, explained in the detailed formulawhich is called 'Pa¥iccasamuppæda', Conditioned Genesis or DependentOrigination, consisting of twelve factors.Various aspects of Pa¥iccasamuppæda, together with expositions ondoctrinal matters concerning practice of the holy life form the maintheme of early suttas in these saμyuttas.Nidæna SaμyuttaIn Pa¥iccasamuppæda Sutta, the first sutta of this saμyutta, the law ofDependent Origination outlined in the form of a formula is briefly explainedby the Buddha to five hundred bhikkhus who are perceived by the Buddha tobe sufficiently developed and ripe for the attainment to Arahatship. In theVibha³ga Sutta, the second sutta of this saμyutta, the law of DependentOrigination is explained in fuller detail to the same bhikkhus."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"103In Pañcaverabhaya Sutta, the Buddha lays down the criteria bywhich the status of attainment of a noble bhikkhu may be judged. If abhikkhu is freed of the five dangers arising from five evil deeds, namely,killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, telling lies and taking intoxicatingliquor and drugs; if he is established in the four accomplishments of aSotæpanna, namely, firm faith and confidence in the virtues and attributesof the Buddha, of the Dhamma and of the Saμgha, and perfect purity insøla; and if he possesses comprehensive analytical knowledge of the lawof Dependent Origination, he is assured of a happy future, with no dangerof arising in states of woe and misery and is certain of furtheradvancement in the holy life.In Puttamaμsþpama Sutta, it is explained that four nutriments,æhæra, are 'conditions' necessary for the existence and continuity ofbeings: (i) ordinary material food (kabaløkæræhæra), (ii) contact of senseorgans (phassa) with sense objects, (iii) consciousness (viññæ¼a), and(iv) mental volitional or will (manosañcetanæ).This sutta is addressed especially to young bhikkhus recentlyadmitted into the Order. They are enjoined to take their meals with duereflection on the loathsome nature of food so as not to be overcome bygreed and attachment for it. A bhikkhu should take meals not with a viewto enjoy it or relish it, thereby augmenting craving, but just to sustainhimself in order that the holy life may be lived. A particularlyilluminating parable is used here by the Buddha: A man and his wife setout on a very long journey accompanied by their beloved son. Half-wayon their journey they ran short of food. With no means of fresh supply,they plodded on with starvation staring in their face. The little son soonsuccumbed to hunger and died. The man and his wife decided to savetheir lives by eating the flesh of their dead son. They ate with no relishnor enjoyment but only to sustain themselves for the rest of the journey.Other apt parables are given by the Buddha for the understanding ofthe remaining three nutriments. When one understands the real nature ofnutriments on which life depends, one understands the craving, ta¼hæ,responsible for all the suffering. Thereby the way is open to the supremeliberation, the Arahatship.Susima Paribbæjaka Sutta gives an account of the wandering asceticSusima who is one of those who join the Buddha's Order with ulteriormotives. After the rains residence many bhikkhus come to pay theirrespect to the Buddha to whom they report their attainment ofArahatship. When he learns from these Arahats that they possess nosupernormal powers such as the Divine Power of Vision, Divine Power"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"104of Hearing, or Knowing Other People's Mind, he is very disappointed.He has come into the Order just to acquire such powers with which towin fame and gain for himself.He approaches the Buddha and inquires how the bhikkhus couldclaim Arahatship when they possess no supernormal powers. The Buddhaexplains to him that their liberation is through pure Insight Knowledge,not associated with jhæna accomplishments. Through Vipassanæmeditation only they have seen the real nature of næma and rþpa (realitiesof nature, Dhamma¥¥hiti) followed by realization of Nibbæna throughMagga Ñæ¼a.The Buddha takes him through the same course of meditation,testing by means of questions his understanding of the five khandhas,their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, insubstantiality,finally establishing in him the insight that none of these khandhas is to beregarded as, \"This is mine, this is I, this is my self \". At the end of thediscourse he gains full understanding of the Dhamma with the attainmentof Arahatship. When he realizes Arahatship himself without coming intopossession of the supernormal powers, he confesses to the Buddha theulterior motive with which he had first joined the Order, and begs to bepardoned for such evil intentions.Dhætu SaμyuttaThe natural law of affinity is pointed out by the Buddha in theCa³kama Sutta of this saμyutta while he is staying at the Gijjhakþ¥a Hillnear Ræjagaha. He draws the attention of the bhikkhus to the sceneoutside, where his senior disciples are taking a stroll attended upon bytheir own group of followers. He says: \"Bhikkhus, those many bhikkhusunder the leadership of the Venerable Særiputta are all wise beingendowed with much deep knowledge of the Dhamma. Those surroundingthe Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna are well accomplished in supernormalpowers. The Venerable Mahækassapa and his followers are strictobservers of Dhuta³ga austerity practices. The bhikkhus led by theVenerable Anuruddha are fully endowed with the Divine Power ofVision. The Venerable Pu¼¼a and his disciples are adepts at teaching theDhamma. The Venerable Upæli with his followers are experts in Vinayarules of discipline and the bhikkhus under Ænanda's guidance are notedfor their knowledge in many fields. Devadatta and his many followers aredistinguished by their evil ways, thoughts and desires. Bhikkhus, in this"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"105way are beings grouped together in accordance with their natural bentsand tendencies. The law of affinity works in such a way that kindredspirits flock together, those of evil disposition in one group, those ofwholesome inclinations in another. This law of affinity has held true inthe past, as it is true now and will be true in the future.\"Anamatagga SaμyuttaIn the various suttas of this saμyutta, the Buddha teaches that thecycle of existence, the saμsæra, represents the continuous arising andpassing away of khandhas, æyatanas and dhætus. This incessant processof evolution and dissolution of dhætus (the fundamental elements ofmatter and mind) and khandhas (compounded of the dhætus) is endless.Blinded by avijjæ, ignorance, and by nøvara¼as, hindrances, and fetteredby ta¼hæ, craving, beings have been passing from one existence toanother round and round the cycle of saμsæra, for immeasurable periodsof time. To bring home this fact of immensity of suffering undergone bybeings, the Buddha has given many similes in this saμyutta, mostillustrative of which are those of the four oceans and the VepullaMountain given in the Assu Sutta. The tears shed through the ages byeach being on account of suffering due to disease, death, separation fromthe loved ones, association with the unloved ones would fill the fouroceans to the brim. The bones left behind by a being after death in eachexistence, if collected together at a certain place and preserved from lossand decay, would be as high as the Vepulla Mountain which lies north ofthe Gijjhakþ¥a Hill.The only way to escape from this round of endless suffering is toperceive the real nature of the khandhas by means of Vipassanæmeditation until one becomes disenchanted with them; and thus byabandoning craving for and attachment to them one attains liberationthrough realization of Nibbæna.The Buddha teaches in other suttas that one should in themeanwhile develop loving-kindness towards all sentient beings with therealization that, during the immeasurably long passage through thesaμsæra, there is no being who has not been one's mother, father, sister,brother or one's son or daughter, relative or friend."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"106Kassapa SaμyuttaIn the Candþpama Sutta of this saμyutta the Buddha lays downcodes of conduct for bhikkhus, giving the example of the moon. Just asthe moon sheds its light equally on every object or person so also abhikkhu should equally treat everyone, young or old or of middle age,showing favouritism to none, nor hostility to any. He must deal withthem with due regard, humility and meekness. Mindfulness should beever present in his relations with all classes of people. For example, whena certain person tries to obtain his drinking water from an old well orfrom a riverbank of loose sand or from down a precipice, he approachesthe source of water with great care, controlling his movements andactions. Much in the same way should a bhikkhu conduct himself withgreat mindfulness in his dealings with all classes of people.In teaching the Dhamma to lay disciples, if his motive is to wingain and fame for himself, then his teaching should be regarded asimpure. The Dhamma should always be taught only out of compassionand with pure thought so that the Dhamma which is excellent in thebeginning, excellent in the middle and excellent in the ending, namely,the Dhamma on søla, samædhi and paññæ, could be heard, understood andpractised by the listener.In the Saddhammappa¥irþpaka Sutta, the Buddha outlines theconditions under which the Teaching would decline or under which itwould prosper. The Buddha gives the discourse in answer to a questionasked by the Venerable Mahækassapa why it is that in former days whenthere were only a few disciplinary rules promulgated by the Buddha,there were a large number of Arahats; now that the disciplinary ruleshave multiplied, only a few attain to Arahatship.The Buddha explains that the number of disciplinary rulesincreases in proportion to the deterioration in the moral state of beings.So long as no spurious and false teaching appears in the three branches ofthe Teaching (pariyatti, theoretical learning; pa¥ipatti, practice; pa¥ivedha,fruits of the practice), so long will the Teaching remain genuine, pure,and untarnished. But when spurious and false teaching appears, thisTeaching with its three branches will decline gradually until it vanishesaltogether, much in the same way as genuine gold disappears whenimitation gold is introduced to take its place.The Buddha concludes: \"And Kassapa, just as iron is destroyed byrust, it is the members of the Order who are corrupt, immoral, whocannot hope to attain higher knowledge, who will bring about thedownfall of the Teaching.\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"107In the last few suttas of Nidæna Vagga are discourses that describethe fearful destiny of corrupt bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs and those laypeople who have done evil deeds in previous lives. The Venerable MahæMoggallæna sees them suffering intensely in the Peta world and describestheir conditions vividly. The Buddha confirms what the VenerableMoggallæna has recounted.(c) Khandha Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹iThe main theme of most suttas in this division is, as the nameimplies, khandhas, the five aggregates that constitute what is regarded asa being. Each of the components of these aggregates, namely, matter,sensation, perception, mental concomitants and consciousness is shownto be a bundle of dukkha, suffering. Made up of thirteen saμyuttas,Khandha Vagga forms an important collection of doctrinal discussions onsuch topics as atta, anatta, eternity, and annihilation.The Nakulapitu Sutta gives an account of the advice given toNakulapitæ, an ageing disciple of the Buddha. He asks for advice fromthe Buddha on how to conduct and keep himself free from the pains ofold age and disease. The Buddha explains that rþpakkhandha, thematerial body being a bundle of dukkha, is subjected constantly to thepains of old age and disease; but the mental complex could be kept freeof agony and pain by keeping it undefiled with impurities. A moredetailed exposition of this brief explanation of the Buddha is given toNakulapitæ by the Venerable Særiputta. The uninstructed commonworldling clings to the five aggregates through craving and conceit, andholds the wrong view that each of the aggregates (rþpa, vedanæ, saññæ,sa³khæra and viññæ¼a) is self, atta. Even as he clings to the fiveaggregates as atta these aggregates manifest their own oppressivecharacters by inflicting pain of old age, pain of disease, pain ofdefilements (kilesa). Because of these oppressive pains, the uninstructedcommon worldling is subjected to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief anddespair. But when the worldling becomes instructed and has becomeaccomplished in the Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment, he does notcling to the five aggregates through craving, conceit or holding wrongviews of self. Then even though the five aggregates manifest their owncharacteristics of being oppressive, he is no longer subjected to mentalafflictions of sorrow, lamentations, pain, grief and despair."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"108In the Bhæra Sutta, the five groups of grasping(Pañcupædænakkhandha) are designated as a burden, a heavy load. It iscraving for sense objects, craving for existence, craving for non-existencewhich is responsible for this heavy burden being borne along. Realizationof the Noble Truth of Cessation, Nibbæna, is where the craving iscompletely eradicated, where this heavy load is finally discarded.The Yamaka Sutta explains that the five aggregates are of animpermanent nature; they should be looked upon as one's enemies.Understanding their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness,insubstantiality, the twenty kinds of wrong views of self should bediscarded so that one may not be set upon by these enemies.The Vakkali Sutta gives an account of the Buddha's visit to the ailingBhikkhu Vakkali upon his request. The great compassion of the Buddhabecomes manifest in this account. When Vakkali informs the Buddha thatfor a long time he has been longing to set his eyes upon the Buddha, theBuddha gently reproaches him: \"Vakkali, what is there in seeing thedecomposing body of mine? It is enough to see the Dhamma. He who hasseen the Dhamma has seen me. This body of mine is like all else — alwaysrotting away, falling into decay.\" Then the Buddha teaches him thedhamma on the impermanence of all things, their unsatisfactoriness andinsubstantiality and finally shows him the way to liberation.Of the five aggregates, the Buddha says it is better for a person tomistake his physical body as atta, self, rather than mind or consciousness,because the physical body appears more solid and substantial thanthought or mind which constantly changes faster than the physical body.The Khemaka Sutta records an illuminating conversation between abhikkhu named Khemaka and a group of bhikkhus who want to verify thestage of his attainments. When the bhikkhus ask him if he sees self oranything pertaining to self in the five aggregates, Khemaka replies \"No.\"But when the bhikkhus suggest that, if so, he must be an Arahat free fromdefilements, Khemaka replies that though he does not find self oranything pertaining to self in the five khandhas, he is not an Arahat freeof taints. He still has a vague feeling \"I am\" although he does not clearlysee \"This is I\" with respect to matter, sensation, perception, mentalformations or consciousness.His vague feeling is likened to the smell of a flower: It is neitherthe smell of the petals, nor of the colour, nor of the pollen, but the smellof the flower. He then goes on to explain that even if a person retains thefeeling \"I am\" at the early stages of realization, as he progresses furtherand attains to higher stages, this feeling of \"I am\" disappears altogether,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"109just as the smell of soap lingers in a freshly washed cloth and disappearsafter a time when it is kept in a box.In the Puppha Sutta, the Buddha declares that he is not quarrellingor arguing with the world; it is only the world with its devas, mæras,kings and people that is disputing with him. To proclaim the truth is notengaging in disputes. He speaks only what wise men hold to be true.Wise men say that there is no corporeality, sensation, perception, mentalformations or consciousness which is stable, permanent, enduring. Hesays the same. Wise men say that there is only corporeality, sensation,perception, mental formations or consciousness which is unstable,impermanent, unenduring. He also says so.\"In this changing world, there are only things which are subject toconstant change and decay. Perceiving their real nature, I declare that theworld is compounded of things subject to decay and decomposition,namely, the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, mentalformations and consciousness, which are incessantly rising and passingaway. There is nothing else besides these perishing aggregates. Bhikkhus,I teach this dhamma in a brief manner. I also teach this dhamma morecomprehensively and completely. But if the uninstructed commonworldling remains unperceiving and unknowing in spite of veryenlightening discourses, how can I help? Bhikkhus, various kinds of lotusgrow in water, develop in water, rise above water, and remain thereunpolluted by water; so also I was born in this world, I grew up in thisworld. I developed in this world and rose high above it without beingattached to it, without being affected by it\".In the Phe¼api¼ðþpama Sutta, the aggregate of rþpa is likened tofroth; it is unstable, impermanent, constantly rising, and vanishing. It istherefore not self. The aggregate of vedanæ is likened to an air bubble.The various sensations are just like bubbles, disappearing fast,impermanent, untrustworthy, of the nature of anicca, dukkha and anatta.Sense perception which apprehends whatever is seen, heard, smelt,tested, touched or known, is likened to a mirage. What is considered by asama¼a as a being, a man, a woman or self is an optical illusion like amirage. In reality, it is merely a phenomenon of incessant arising andvanishing. Sa³khæræ, volitional activities, are likened to plantain trunks.A plantain trunk is made up of layers of fibrous material with nosubstantial, solid inner core. Sa³khæra is like the plantain trunk void ofinner substance. Consciousness is like a conjuror's trick. It arises andvanishes instantly. Consciousness arises not as one wishes, but asconditioned by its own cause and circumstance."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"110(d) Sa¹æyatana Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹iThis division is made up of ten saμyuttas or groups. It deals mainlywith the six sense organs or bases of contact named internal sense bases(eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind), six corresponding sense objects,known as external sense bases (visible form, sound, odour, taste, tangiblethings and mind-objects), and consciousness that arises in relation to eachpair of these internal and external sense bases. There are expositions onthe impermanent nature of these sense bases and how relinquishing ofattachment to them results in liberation. The sensation arising fromcoming together of the sense bases and consciousness is shown to be ofthree kinds: pleasant, unpleasant, indifferent, none of which ispermanent; each one of these is the cause of craving which in turn is theroot of all suffering. Concise but illuminating expositions on Nibbæna arefound in many suttas. So also are there practical guides for Vipassanæmeditation.In the very first two suttas, the Buddha explains that the six internalsense bases and six external sense bases have the nature ofimpermanence; being impermanent, they are really suffering and not self.\"Bhikkhus, realizing their true nature, you should not regard these twelvesense bases as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is my self '. Contemplateon them steadfastly, constantly, until Vipassanæ Insight into their realnature arises.\" The Buddha continues to explain that insight into the truenature of the twelve Æyatanas will develop dispassion anddisenchantment for them. Being disenchanted with them, there is nocraving, clinging, thereby achieving the Path and Fruition.In the famous Æditta Sutta, the fire sermon, delivered at Gayæsisa toone thousand ascetics formerly devoted to fire-worship but recently con-verted and admitted into the Order as bhikkhus, the Buddha explains thateach of the six sense bases and the six sense objects is burning; each isburning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of ignor-ance. Each is burning with the fire of birth, ageing and death; with thefire of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Six forms of conscious-ness arising in relation to the six sense bases are also burning; the sixcontacts and the six sensations resulting from them are also burning.The Buddha explains further that when a bhikkhu who has practisedthe dhamma develops Vipassanæ Insight and perceives that each of thebases is burning, he becomes disenchanted with it. Then craving fadesaway. With the fading of craving, he is liberated. And when liberated,there is knowledge that he is liberated. At the end of the discourse, onethousand former worshippers of fire attain Arahatship."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"111In the Pa¥hama Migajæla Sutta, the Buddha's definition of abhikkhu who lives in solitude is very edifying. When a bhikkhuunmindfully takes delight in the six sense objects, regards them wronglyas 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is my self ', craving for them arises inhim and he becomes attached to fetters. Such a bhikkhu in whom cravinghas arisen is regarded as one living with a companion, even if he livesalone deep in a forest away from towns and villages. When, however, hemindfully perceives the true nature of the six sense bases and objects, hedoes not wrongly hold on to them as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This ismy self ' and craving for them does not arise in him. Such a bhikkhu inwhom craving has not arisen is said to be living in solitude without anycompanion even if he lives in the midst of people, in towns or villages.The Pu¼¼a Sutta gives an account of a bhikkhu by the name ofPu¼¼a who asks for instruction from the Buddha on a suitable subject onwhich he can meditate in solitude. The Buddha advises him tocontemplate on the true nature of the six sense bases and objects. Whenhe perceives their true nature, no craving for them will arise in him.Eradication of craving will result in liberation and attainment ofArahatship. After receiving the instruction, the bhikkhu informs theBuddha of his intention to reside in a very distant and remote land. TheBuddha tells him that it is a wild country inhabited by savage tribes, andasks him how he intends to cope with the dangers and hazards that wouldface him. The answer given by the bhikkhu provides a model lesson infortitude and endurance.The bhikkhu says, if he were menaced with invectives and curses orattacked physically, or if he had stones thrown at him or if he were hitwith sticks or cut with swords, or pierced with spears, he would bearthem with endurance with no malice against the savage tribes. Even if hishead were to be chopped off he would feel he was luckier than thosenoble ones who had to commit suicide to be released from the sufferingsof the khandhas.The Buddha remarks, \"Well said, bhikkhu, well said. I believe youare qualified to lead a solitary life in that wild country. You willovercome all difficulties.\"As presaged by the Buddha, the bhikkhu is able to overcome allhostilities and difficulties in his new residence and to convert five hundredmen and five hundred women so that they come to take refuge in theBuddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha. And during the very first vassaresidence, practising the meditation as instructed by the Buddha, theBhikkhu Pu¼¼a attains Arahatship, fully accomplished in the three vijjæs."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"112In the Bhæradvæja Sutta, an interesting interview between KingUdena and the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja is described. King Udenaapproaches the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja while he is meditating atthe foot of a tree in the king's park. The king remarks that many youngmen have abandoned sensual pleasures and led the holy life. Theymaintain the holy practice throughout their life. The king enquires, \"Whatis the means by which they maintain the purity of their holy life?\" Thebhikkhu replies that they keep to the pure life by training themselves asinstructed by the Buddha to regard a woman of their mother's age as theirmother, a woman of their sister's age as their sister, and a girl of theirdaughter's age as their daughter.The king is not satisfied with the answer. He argues that even if abhikkhu trains himself in the said manner, it is no guarantee for the non-arising of impure thoughts in him in connection with a female person.The Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja explains further they practisemeditation on the foulness of a body by contemplating on the thirty-twoconstituent parts of the body. The king is still not convinced; hemaintains that, for older bhikkhus with more mature experience, who arewell established in mindfulness and concentration, contemplation on thethirty-two constituent parts of the body might prove to be salutory; butthis type of meditation for younger bhikkhus might have an adverseeffect, exciting lust and passion instead of aversion for the human body.Only when the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja tells him that the bhikkhuspractise restraint of the six faculties keeping a close watch on the doors ofthe six senses that the king agrees that purity of the holy life is possibleunder such circumstances.In the Pa¥hama Dærukkhandhopama Sutta, the discourse given bythe Buddha on the bank of the River Ganges at Kosambø, the Buddhauses the simile of a log floating down the river. He says that if the logdoes not get stranded on either of the two banks, nor sinks in the middleof the river, nor gets salvaged and deposited on the bank by some one,nor is retrieved by men or devas, nor sucked in by a whirlpool, and if itdoes not get decomposed on the way, it will be carried by the current tillits destination, the ocean, is reached.In this simile, the near bank means the six internal sense bases; thefar bank represents the six external sense objects; sinking in the mid-rivermeans getting immersed in sensuous desires; being salvaged anddeposited on a bank means being hindered by one's own conceit; beingretrieved by men means doing some services or running errands for men;being retrieved by devas means practising the holy life with the deva"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"113realm as one's objective; being sucked in a whirlpool means wallowingin sensual pleasures; getting decomposed on the way means becomingcorrupt, immoral, heedless of the disciplinary rules. If a bhikkhu managesto steer himself clear of all these obstacles, he will be carried along by thecurrent of Right View till he reaches his destination, Nibbæna.In the Chappæ¼akopama Sutta, the Buddha teaches that a bhikkhupractising the holy life must exercise control of his sense faculties. Thesix sense faculties may be likened to six animals, namely, a snake, acrocodile, a giant bird, a dog, a jackal and a monkey. Suppose eachanimal is bound by a rope and the ropes are tied together into a singleknot. When they are left in this state, each animal will try to get to itsown habitat, the snake to its underground hole, the crocodile to the river,etc. In this way they will pull and struggle against one another until theybecome exhausted and are dragged along by the strongest of them. Themind of a bhikkhu with unrestrained sense faculties will be impelled bythe senses towards corresponding sense objects.But suppose each animal is bound by a separate rope which isfastened to a pole firmly planted in the ground. Each animal will makefurious attempts to return to its home and becoming exhausted finallywill stand, sit, curl or lie down quietly near the post. Similarly bypractising contemplation of the body, Kæyagatæsati, the sense facultiesare placed well under control. Mindfulness of the body serves as the firmpost to which each of the faculties is tied down.Dukkarapañhæ Sutta states that in the Teaching of the Buddha, it isdifficult first to become a member of the Order as a novice and as abhikkhu. Secondly, it is difficult to be happy and comfortable in theOrder with its disciplinary rules. Thirdly, even if one stays the course andremains in the Order, it is difficult for one to practise concentrationmeditation and Vipassanæ meditation to attain to higher stages ofknowledge. When fully endowed with supporting pæramøs (perfections),a bhikkhu who gets instruction in the morning and starts practisingmeditation in the morning may be fully liberated by the evening; if hegets instruction in the evening and starts practising meditation in theevening he may be fully liberated by the morning.A wealthy householder by the name of Citta figures quiteprominently in some of the suttas of this division. In Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputtaSutta, Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta finds himself unable to accept the viewexpressed by the Buddha that there is jhæna and samædhi free fromvitakka and vicæra. He discusses this problem with Citta, the wealthyhouseholder, who is an Ariya disciple of the Buddha. Citta tells him: \"I"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"114believe there is jhæna and samædhi free from vitakka and vicæra, notbecause of my faith in the Buddha but because of my own achievementand realization.\" Citta explains that he has personally experienced jhænasamædhi unaccompanied by vitakka and vicæra and has no need to rely onothers for believing this.The same Citta used to have in his younger days a close friend wholater became the naked ascetic Kassapa. Each has gone his own separateway and the two friends meet again only after thirty years. Citta asks hisfriend whether by living the ascetic life he has gained any thing morethan what could be achieved by the wholesome dhamma of ordinarypeople. The ascetic Kassapa admits that he has nothing to show besideshis nakedness, his shaven head and accumulation of dust on his body.When asked in return what he himself has gained by being adisciple of the Buddha and following the Path as instructed by hisTeacher, Citta informs him that he has become fully accomplished in thefour jhænas, and having removed the five fetters, is now an Anægæmø, aNon-returner. The naked ascetic, impressed by his achievements, tellsCitta that he wants to be a disciple of the Buddha. Citta introduces him tothe leading bhikkhus and helps him to get admission into the Order. Withthe guidance of the theras and encouragement of his friend Citta, the ex-ascetic Kassapa puts in such an effort in the practice of meditation that inno time he gains the supreme goal of Arahatship.In the Sa³khadhama Sutta, the Buddha points out the wrong viewsheld by Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta on kamma and its resultant effects.According to the village headman Asibandhakaputta, his TeacherNiga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta teaches that every one who commits evil deeds ofkilling, lying, etc. is definitely bound to be reborn in states of woe.Whatever action is performed in a greater frequency, that action tends todetermine the destiny of a being. The Buddha points out the fallacy in thetwo statements, one contradicting the other. An individual does not oftencommit the evil deed, for instance, of killing. Other actions besideskilling are performed by him in a more frequent manner; hence,according to Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta, he will not be destined to states of woefor his evil act of killing.Then the Buddha explains that only very heinous acts such askilling of one's own parents, creating a schism in the Saμgha, etc. bringthe dire resultant effect of certain destiny in the states of woe. Othermisdeeds, physical, vocal or mental, cannot be regarded as to lead withcertainty to unhappy destinations. Instead of just feeling remorseful andpenitent over one's particular evil deed, one should recognize it to be"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"115evil, and resolve not to repeat a similar unwholesome action, and followit with the practice of concentration and Vipassanæ meditation.Thus abandoning all evil deeds and doing only wholesome deedstogether with development of Brahmavihæra Bhævanæ till accomplishedin jhæna, one can escape from the unhappy consequences of one's evilactions and look forward to a better future. This Sa³khadhama Suttaestablishes the fact that as in matter of practice so also in the matters ofviews, the Buddha takes the Middle Path.In the Bhadraka Sutta, the Buddha explains the origin of sufferingby giving illuminating examples. The village headman Bhadraka wants toknow the cause of suffering that afflicts mankind. In reply, the Buddhaasks him to think of his son and imagine that his son is meeting withunexpected misfortunes, or getting arrested by the king's order or facinga severe punishment. Bhadraka imagines as he is told and finds that suchthoughts give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, grief and despairin him. When he imagines a stranger to be placed in a similar situation,facing similar predicament, he finds that he is not troubled at all with anymental agony. He explains to the Buddha that the difference in his mentalreaction to the two situations lies in the fact that he loves his son with aparent's love and is very fond of his son, whereas he has no such feelingtowards the stranger.Next the Buddha asks him if any love, passion or desire arises inhim before he meets or sees or hears about the woman who has becomehis wife. Bhadraka replies that only when he meets, sees and hears abouther that he develops passion and attachment towards his wife. When theBuddha asks him further whether he will suffer from sorrow,lamentation, pain, distress, grief, despair, if anything untoward happensto his wife, he confesses that he will suffer more than these agonies; hemight even lose his life through intense suffering.The Buddha points out then that the root cause of suffering in theworld is craving, greed, passion and desire that engulf mankind. It hasbeen so in the past, as it is now and so it will be in the future.(e) Mahæ Vagga Saμyutta Pæ¹iThe last Vagga of Saμyutta Nikæya is made up of twelvesaμyuttas, the list of which gives a clear indication of the subjects dealtwith in this division: Magga Saμyutta, Bojjha³ga Saμyutta, Satipa¥¥hæna"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"116Saμyutta, Indriya Saμyutta, Sammappadhæna Saμyutta, Bala Saμyutta,Iddhipæda Saμyutta, Anuruddha Saμyutta, Jhæna Saμyutta, ÆnæpænaSaμyutta, Sotæpatti Saμyutta and Sacca Saμyutta. The main doctrineswhich form the fundamental basis of the Buddha's Teaching are reviewedin these saμyuttas, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects. Inthe concluding suttas of the vagga, the ultimate goal of the holy life,Arahatta Phala, Nibbæna, end of all suffering, is constantly kept in fullview together with a detailed description of the way of achieving it,namely, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents.In the opening suttas it is pointed out how friendship with the goodand association with the virtuous is of immense help for the attainment ofthe Path and Perfection. It is one of the supporting factors conducive tothe welfare of a bhikkhu. Not having a virtuous friend and good adviseris a great handicap for him in his endeavours to attain the Path.In the Ku¼ðaliya Sutta, the wandering ascetic Ku¼ðaliya asks theBuddha what his objective is in practising the holy life. When the Buddhareplies that he lives the holy life to enjoy the Fruits of the Path and thebliss of liberation by knowledge, the ascetic wants to know how to achievethese results. The Buddha advises him to cultivate and frequently practiserestraint of the five senses. This will establish the threefold good conductin deed, word and thought. When the threefold good conduct is cultivatedand frequently practised, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness will beestablished. When the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are wellestablished the Seven Factors of Enlightenment will be developed. Whenthe Seven Factors of Enlightenment are developed and frequently applied,the Fruits of the Path and liberation by knowledge will be achieved.In the Udæyi Sutta, there is an account of Udæyi who givesconfirmation of such achievements through personal experience. He tellshow he comes to know about the five khandhas from the discourses, howhe practises contemplation on the arising and ceasing of these khandhas,thereby developing Udayabbaya Ñæ¼a which, through frequentcultivation, matures into Magga Insight. Progressing still further bydeveloping and applying frequently the Seven Factors of Enlightenmenthe ultimately attains Arahatship. In many suttas are recorded the personalexperiences of bhikkhus and lay disciples who on being afflicted withserious illness are advised to cultivate and practise the Seven Factors ofEnlightenment. They recount how they are relieved, not only of pains ofsickness but also of suffering that arises from craving.In Saku¼agghi Sutta, the bhikkhus are exhorted by the Buddha tokeep within the confines of their own ground, i.e., the Four Foundations"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"117of Mindfulness, namely, contemplation of body, sensation, mind andmind-objects. They can roam freely in the safe resort guarded by theseoutposts of Four Foundations of Mindfulness, unharmed by lust, hate andignorance. Once they stray outside their own ground, they exposethemselves to the allurements of the sensuous world. The parable offalcon and skylark illustrates this point. A fierce falcon suddenly seizeshold of a tiny skylark which is feeding in an open field. Clutched in theclaws of its captor, the unfortunate young bird bemoans its foolishness inventuring outside of its own ground to fall a victim to the raiding falcon.\"If only I had stayed put on my own ground inherited from my parents, Icould easily have beaten off this attack by the falcon.\" Bemused by thischallenging soliloquy, the falcon asks the skylark where that groundwould be that it has inherited from its parents. The skylark replies, \"Theinterspaces between clods of earth in the ploughed fields are my groundinherited from my parents.\" \"All right, tiny tot, I shall release you now.See if you can escape my clutches even on your own ground.\"Then standing on a spot where three big clods of earth meet, theskylark derisively invites the falcon, \"Come and get me, you big brute.\"Burning with fury, the falcon sweeps down with fierce speed to grab themocking little bird in its claws. The skylark quickly disappears into theinterspaces of the earth clods, but the big falcon, unable to arrest its ownspeed, smashes into the hard protruding clods to meet its painful death.In Bhikkhunupassaya Sutta, the Buddha explains for Ænanda'sbenefit two methods of meditation. When established in the FourFoundations of Mindfulness, a bhikkhu will experience a beneficialresult, gradually increasing. But should his mind be distracted by externalthings during the contemplation on body, sensation, mind or mind-object,the bhikkhu should direct his mind to some confidence-inspiring object,such as recollection of the virtues of the Buddha. By doing so, heexperiences joy, rapture, tranquillity and happiness, which is conduciveto concentration. He can then revert back to the original object ofmeditation. When his mind is not distracted by external things, no needarises for him to direct his mind to any confidence-inspiring object. TheBuddha concludes his exhortation thus: \"Here are trees and secludedplaces, Ænanda. Practise meditation, Ænanda. Be not neglectful lest youregret it afterwards.\"As set out in the Cira¥¥hiti Sutta, the Venerable Ænanda takes thisinjunction to heart and regards the practice of the Four Methods ofSteadfast Mindfulness as of supreme importance. When a bhikkhu by thename of Badda asks the Venerable Ænanda, after the death of the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"118Buddha, what will bring about the disappearance of the Buddha'sTeaching, the Venerable Ænanda replies, \"So long as the practice of theFour Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness is not neglected, so long will theTeaching prosper; but when the practice of the Four Methods of SteadfastMindfulness declines, the Teaching will gradually disappear.\"Ænæpænassati meditation, one of the methods of body contem-plation, consists in watching closely one's in-breath and out-breath and israted highly as being very beneficial. In the Mahæ Kappina Sutta, thebhikkhus inform the Buddha, \"We notice, Venerable Sir, that bhikkhuMahæ Kappina is always calm and collected, never excited, whether he isin company or alone in the forest!\" \"It is so, bhikkhus. One who practisesÆnæpænassati meditation with mindfulness and full comprehensionremains calm in body and collected in mind, unruffled, unexcited.\"The Icchæna³gala Sutta describes how the Buddha himself oncestayed for the rains-residence of three months in Icchæna³gala forestgrove in solitude practising Ænæpænassati meditation most of the time.Ænæpænassati meditation is known as the abode of the Enlightened Ones,the abode of the Noble Ones.When fully accomplished in the cultivation of the Seven Factors ofEnlightenment, through practice of body contemplation or Ænæpænassatimeditation, one becomes firmly established in unshakable confidence inthe Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha. The moral conduct of such aperson, through observance of precepts, is also without blemish. He hasreached, in his spiritual development, the stage of the Stream-winner,Sotæpatti Magga, by virtue of which, he will never be reborn in states ofwoe and misery. His path only leads upwards, towards the three higherstages of accomplishment. He has only to plod on steadfastly withoutlooking backwards.This is explained in the Pa¥hama Mahænæma Sutta, by the simile ofan earthern pot filled partly with gravel and stones and partly with fat andbutter. By throwing this pot into water and smashing it with a stick, itwill be seen that gravel and stones quickly sink to the bottom while fatand butter rise to the surface of the water. Likewise, when a person whohas established himself in the five wholesome dhammas of faith, conduct,learning, charity and insight dies, his body remains to get decomposedbut his extremely purified mental continuum continues in higher states ofexistence as birth-linking consciousness, patisandhi citta.In the concluding suttas are expositions on the Middle Path, theFour Noble Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"119The Buddha's first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,appears in the last saμyutta, namely, Saccasaμyutta.The Buddha did not make his claim to supremely perfectenlightenment until he had acquired full understanding of the Four NobleTruths. \"As long, O bhikkhus, as my knowledge of reality and insightregarding the Four Noble Truths in three aspects and twelve ways wasnot fully clear to me, so long did I not admit to the world with its devas,mæras and brahmæs, to the mass of beings with its recluses, brahmins,kings and people that I had understood, attained and realized rightly bymyself the incomparable, the most excellent perfect enlightenment.\"The Buddha concluded his first sermon with the words \"This is mylast existence.

The first nipæta, Ekaka Nipæta, provides in eachsutta single items of dhamma called the Ones; the second nipæta, DukaNipæta, contains in each sutta two items of dhamma called the Twos, andthe last nipæta, Ekædasaka Nipæta, is made up of suttas with eleven itemsof dhamma in each, called the Elevens.A³guttara Nikæya constitutes an important source book on Buddhistpsychology and ethics, which provides an enumerated summary of all theessential features concerning the theory and practice of the Dhamma.

The miscellaneous nature of this collection,containing not only the discourses by the Buddha but compilations ofbrief doctrinal notes mostly in verse, accounts of personal struggles andachievements by theras and therøs also in verse, the birth stories, thehistory of the Buddha etc., may account for its title.The following is the list of treatises as approved by the SixthInternational Buddhist Synod.Khuddaka Nikæya(a) Vinaya (b) Abhidhamma (c) Suttas not Pi¥aka Pi¥aka included in the first four Nikæyas(1) Khuddaka Pæ¥ha (7) Petavatthu (13) Apadæna(2) Dhammapada (8) Theragæthæ (14) Buddhavaμsa(3) Udæna  (9) Therøgæthæ (15) Cariyæ Pi¥aka(4) Itivuttaka (10) Jætaka (16) Netti(5) Suttanipæta (11) Niddesa (17) Pe¥akopadesa (Mahæ, Cþ¹a)(6) Vimænavatthu (12) Pa¥isaμbhidæ (18) Milinda PañhæMagga"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"134(1) Khuddakapæ¥ha Pæ¹iFirst of the treatises in this Nikæya, Khuddakapæ¥ha, contains\"readings of mirror passages\" most of which are also found in other partsof Tipi¥aka.

It implies (i) one'shumility; (ii) acceptance of the Triple Gems as one's guiding principlesand ideals; (iii) acceptance of discipleship and (iv) homage.In the section on 'Kumæra pañha,' questions for young boys, thedhamma is tailored to suit the young intellect of novices:What is the One? — The Nutriment which sustains the life of beings.What are the Two? — Næma and Rþpa.What are the Three? — Pleasant, Unpleasant, Neutral Vedanæs.What are the Four? — The Four Noble Truths.What are the Five? — The five groups of grasping.What are the Six? — The six bases of senses.What are the Seven? — The seven factors of enlightenment.What are the Eight? — The Noble Path of Eight Constituents.What are the Nine? — The nine abodes or types of beings.What are the Ten? — The ten demeritorious courses of action.Mahæ Ma³gala Sutta, the discourse on the great blessings, is afamous sutta cherished highly in all Buddhist countries. It is acomprehensive summary of Buddhist ethics for the individual as well asfor society, composed in elegant verses.

The sutta was delivered for thepurpose of countering the plagues, by invocation of the truth of the specialqualities of the Three Gems, the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saμgha.The Metta Sutta was taught to a group of bhikkhus who were troubl-ed by non-human beings while sitting in meditation at the foot of secludedforest trees. The Buddha showed them how to develop loving-kindnesstowards all beings, the practice which will not only protect them fromharm but also will serve as a basis for insight through attainment of jhæna.The Khuddakapæ¥ha which is a collection of these nine formulaeand suttas appears to be arranged in such a way as to form a continuoustheme demonstrating the practice of the holy life: how a person acceptsthe Buddha's Teaching by taking refuge in the Three Gems; then how heobserves the Ten Precepts for moral purification. Next he takes up ameditation subject, the contemplation of thirty-two constituents of thebody, to develop non-attachment. He is shown next the virtues and meritsof giving and how one handicaps oneself by not performing acts of merit.In the meanwhile he safeguards himself by reciting the Ma³gala Suttaand provides protection to others by reciting the Ratana Sutta. Finally, hedevelops loving-kindness towards all beings, thereby keeping himselfsafe from harm, at the same time he achieves jhænic concentration whichwill eventually lead him to reach the goal of spiritual life, Nibbæna, bymeans of knowledge of Insight and the Path.(2) The Dhammapada Pæ¹iIt is a book of the Tipi¥aka which is popular and well-known notonly in Buddhist countries but also elsewhere. The 'Dhammapada' is acollection of the Buddha's words or basic and essential principles of theBuddha's Teaching. It consists of 423 verses arranged according to topicsin twenty-six vaggas or chapters.Verse 183 gives the teachings of the Buddha in a nutshell: Abstainfrom all evil; Promote (develop) what is good and purify your mind.

One can get much"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"136sustenance and encouragement from the Dhammapada not only forspiritual development but also for everyday living.The Dhammapada describes the path which a wayfarer shouldfollow. It states (in verses 277, 278 and 279) that all conditioned thingsare transitory and impermanent; that all conditioned things are subject tosuffering; and that all things (dhammas) are insubstantial, incapable ofbeing called one's own. When one sees the real nature of things with(Vipassanæ) insight, one becomes disillusioned with the charms andattractions of the Five Aggregates. Such disillusionment constitutes thepath of purity (Nibbæna).Verse 243 defines the highest form of impurity as ignorance (avijjæ)and states that the suffering in the world can be brought to an end only bythe destruction of craving or hankering after sensual pleasures. Greed, illwill and ignorance are described as dangerous as fire and unless they areheld under restraint, a happy life is impossible both now and thereafter.Avoiding the two extremes, namely, indulgence in a life ofsensuous pleasures and the practice of self-mortification, one must followthe Middle Path, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents to attain perfectPeace, Nibbæna. Attainment to the lowest stage (Sotæpatti Magga) on thisPath shown by the Buddha is to be preferred even to the possession of thewhole world (V. 178). The Dhammapada emphasizes that one makes ormars oneself, and no one else can help one to rid oneself of impurity.Even the Buddhas cannot render help; they can only show the way andguide; a man must strive for himself.The Dhammapada recommends a life of peace and non-violenceand points out the eternal law that hatred does not cease by hatred,enmity is never overcome by enmity but only by kindness and love (V.5).It advises to conquer anger by loving-kindness, evil by good, miserlinessby generosity, and falsehood by truth.The Dhammapada contains gems of literary excellence, replete withappropriate similes and universal truths and is thus found appealing andedifying by readers all the world over. It serves as a digest of the essentialprinciples and features of the Buddha Dhamma as well as of the wisdomof all the ages.(3) Udæna Pæ¹iAn udæna is an utterance mostly in metrical form inspired by aparticularly intense emotion. This treatise is a collection of eighty joyful"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"137utterances made by the Buddha on unique occasions of sheer bliss; eachudæna in verse is accompanied by an account in prose of thecircumstances that led to their being uttered.For example, in the first Bodhivagga Sutta are recorded the firstwords spoken aloud by the newly Enlightened Buddha in three stanzasbeginning with the famous opening lines: \"Yadæ have pætubhavantidhammæ, Ætæpino jhæyato bræhma¼assa.\"For seven days after his Enlightenment, the Buddha sat at the footof the Bodhi tree feeling the bliss of liberation. At the end of seven days,he emerged from this (Phala Samæpatti) sustained absorption in Fruition-Mind, to deliberate upon the principle of Dependent Origination: Whenthis is, that is (Imasmiμ sati, idaμ hoti); this having arisen, that arises(Imassuppædæ, idaμ uppajjati); when this is not, that is not (Imasmiμasati, idaμ na hoti); this having ceased, that ceases (Imassa nirodhæ, idaμnirujjhati).In the first watch of the night, when the principle of the origin ofthe whole mass of suffering was thoroughly grasped in a detailed mannerin the order of arising, the Buddha uttered the first stanza of joy:\"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardentlymeditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he understandswhat that nature is as well as its cause.\"In the second watch of the night, his mind was occupied with theprinciple of Dependent Origination in the order of ceasing. When themanner of cessation of suffering was thoroughly understood, the Buddhawas moved again to utter the second stanza of jubilation:\"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardentlymeditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he perceives thecessation of causes.\"In the third watch of the night, the Buddha went over the detailedformula of the principle of Dependent Origination, Pa¥icca Samuppæda,in both the orders of arising and ceasing. Then having mastered thedoctrine of Dependent Origination very thoroughly, the Buddha utteredthe third stanza of solemn utterance:\"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardentlymeditating recluse, then like the sun that illumines the sky, he standsrepelling the dark hosts of Mæra.\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"138(4) Itivuttaka Pæ¹iThe fourth treatise contains 112 suttas divided into four nipætaswith verses and prose mixed, one supplementing the other. Although thecollection contains the inspired sayings of the Buddha as in Udæna, eachpassage is preceded by the phrase 'Iti vuttaμ Bhagavatæ', 'thus was saidby the Buddha,' and reads like a personal note book in which arerecorded short pithy sayings of the Buddha.The division into nipætas instead of vaggas denotes that thecollection is classified in ascending numerical order of the categories ofthe dhamma as in the nipætas of the A³guttara. Thus in Lkaka Nipæta arepassages dealing with single items of the dhamma: \"Bhikkhus, abandoncraving; I guarantee attainment to the stage of an Anægæmø if youabandon craving.\" In Duka Nipæta, each passage deals with units of twoitems of the dhamma: There are two forms of Nibbæna dhætu, namely,Sa-upædisesa Nibbæna dhætu, with the five khandhas still remaining, andAnupædisesa Nibbæna dhætu, without any khandha remaining.(5) Suttanipæta Pæ¹iAs well-known as Dhammapada, Sutta Nipæta is also a work inverse with occasional introductions in prose.

Man's mind is defiled by self-interest. So, becoming disillusioned, roam alone like a rhinoceros.\" (Khaggavisæ¼a Sutta)\"Not by birth does one become an outcast, not by birth does one become a bræhma¼a;By one's action one becomes an outcast, by one's action one becomes a bræhma¼a.\"(Vasala Sutta) \"As a mother even with her life protects her only child, so let one cultivate immeasurable loving-kindness towards all living beings.\"(Mettæ Sutta)"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"139Pæræyana Vagga deals with sixteen questions asked by sixteenbrahmin youths while the Buddha is staying at Pæsænaka Shrine in thecountry of Magadha. The Buddha gives his answers to each of thequestions asked by the youths. Knowing the meaning of each questionand of the answers given by the Buddha, if one practises the Dhamma asinstructed in this sutta, one can surely reach the Other Shore, which isfree from ageing and death. The Dhamma in this sutta is known asPæræyana because it leads to the Other Shore, Nibbæna.(6) Vimæna Vatthu Pæ¹iVimæna means mansion. Here it refers to celestial mansions gainedby beings who have done acts of merit. In this text are eighty-five versesgrouped in seven vaggas; in the first four vaggas, celestial females givean account of what acts of merit they have done in previous existences ashuman beings and how they are reborn in deva realm where magnificentmansions await their appearance. In the last three vaggas, the celestialmales tell their stories.The Venerable Mahæ Moggalæna who can visit the deva realmbrings back these stories as told him by the deva concerned and recountsthem to the Buddha who confirms the stories by supplying morebackground details to them. These discourses are given with a view tobring out the fact that the human world offers plenty of opportunities forperforming meritorious acts. The other objective for such discourses is torefute the wrong views of those who believe that nothing exists after thislife (the annihilationists) and those who maintain that there is no resultanteffect to any action.Of the eighty-five stories described, five stories concern those whohave been reborn in deva world having developed themselves to the stageof Sotæpanna in their previous existences; two stories on those who havemade obeisance to the Buddha with clasped hands; one on those who hadexpressed words of jubilation at the ceremony of building a monasteryfor the Saμgha; two stories on those who had observed the moralprecepts; two stories on those who had observed the precepts and givenalms; and the rest deal with those who have been reborn in the devaworld as the wholesome result of giving alms only.The vivid accounts of the lives of the devas in various deva abodesserve to show clearly that the higher beings are not immortals, nor creators,but are also evolved, conditioned by the results of their previous meritorious"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"140deeds; that they too are subject to the laws of anicca, dukkha and anattaand have to strive themselves to achieve the deathless state of Nibbæna.(7) Peta Vatthu Pæ¹i\"The stories of petas\" are graphic accounts of the miserable statesof beings who have been reborn in unhappy existences as a consequenceof their evil deeds. There are fifty-one stories, divided into four vaggas,describing the life of misery of the evil doers, in direct contrast to themagnificent life of the devas.Emphasis is again laid on the beneficial effects of giving; whereasenvy, jealousy, miserliness, greed and wrong views are shown to be thecauses for appearance in the unhappy state of petas. The chief sufferingin this state is dire lack of food, clothing and dwelling for the condemnedbeing. A certain and immediate release from such miseries can be givento the unfortunate being if his former relatives perform meritorious deedsand share the merit with him. In Tiroku¥¥apeta Vatthu, a detailed accountis given on how King Bimbisæra brings relief to his former relatives whoare unfortunately suffering as petas, by making generous offer of food,clothing and dwelling places to the Buddha and his company of bhikkhusand sharing the merit, thus accrued, to the petas who have been his kithand kin in previous lives.(8) The Thera Gæthæ Pæ¹iand(9) The Therø Gæthæ Pæ¹iThese two treatises form a compilation of delightful verses utteredby some two hundred and sixty-four theras and seventy-three therøsthrough sheer exultation and joy that arise out of their religious devotionand inspiration These inspiring verses gush forth from the hearts ofbhikkhus and bhikkhunøs after their attainment of Arahatship as anannouncement of their achievement and also as statement of their effortwhich has led to their final enlightenment.It may be learnt from these jubilant verses how a trifling incident inlife, a trivial circumstance can become the starting point of spiritual effortwhich culminates in supreme liberation.

Thecrippling bonds of greed, hatred and ignorance have been broken asunderand they are freed. In sheer exultation, they utter forth these inspiringverses, proclaiming their freedom and victory. Some of these therasreach the sublime height of poetic beauty when they recount their solitarylife in the quiet glades and groves of forest, the beauteous nature thatforms their surroundings, and the peace and calm that have facilitatedtheir meditation.Although the verses in the Therø Gæthæ lack the poetic excellenceand impassioned expression of love of solitude that characterise theverses in the Thera Gæthæ, they nevertheless reflect the great piety andunflinching resolution with which the therøs have struggled to reach thegoal. One distinguishing feature of the struggle of the therøs is that manyof them receive the final impetus to seek solace in holy life throughemotional imbalance they have been subject to, for example, loss of thedear ones as in the case of Pa¥æcærø, or through intense personal sufferingover the death of a beloved son as suffered by Kisæ Gotamø.Both the Thera Gæthæ and the Therø Gæthæ provide us with shining,inspiring models of excellence, so consoling and so uplifting, so humanand true to life, leading us on to the path of the holy life, stimulating uswhen our spirit drops, our mind flags, and guiding us through internalconflicts and set-backs.These gæthæs may be enjoyed simply as beautiful poems withexquisite imagery and pleasing words or they may be contemplated on asinspiring messages with deep meaning to uplift the mind to the highestlevels of spiritual attainment.\"Rain god!

Helives thus comfortably, well shielded from the rain and storm of lust,craving and attachments. Undisturbed by the pouring rain, and whirlingwind of conceit, ignorance, hatred, he remains calm and composed,unpolluted.

The Jætaka is an extensive work inverses containing five hundred and forty-seven stories or previousexistences as recounted by the Buddha, (usually referred to in Burma as550 stories). The treatise is divided into nipætas according to the numberof verses concerning each story; the one verse stories are classified asEkaka Nipæta, the two verse stories come under Duka Nipæta etc. It is thecommentary to the verses which gives the complete birth-stories.In these birth-stories are embedded moral principles and practiceswhich the Bodhisatta had observed for self-development and perfectionto attain Buddhahood.(11) Niddesa Pæ¹iThis division of Khuddaka Nikæya consists of two parts: MahæNiddesa, the major exposition which is the commentary on the fourthvagga (A¥¥haka) of the Sutta Nipæta and Cþ¹a Niddesa, the minorexposition which is the commentary on the fifth vagga (Pæræyana) and onthe Khaggavisæ¼a Sutta in the first vagga.

It is a hugecollection of systematically arranged, tabulated and classified doctrinesof the Buddha, representing the quintessence of his Teaching.Abhidhamma means Higher Teaching or Special Teaching; it is unique inits abstruseness, analytical approach, immensity of scope andconduciveness to one's liberation.The Buddha dhamma has only one taste, the taste of liberation. Butin Suttanta discourses, the Buddha takes into consideration theintellectual level of his audience, and their attainments in pæramø. Hetherefore teaches the dhamma in conventional terms (vohæra vacana),making references to persons and objects as I, we, he, she, man, woman,cow, tree, etc. But in Abhidhamma the Buddha makes no suchconcessions; he treats the dhamma entirely in terms of the ultimate reality(Paramattha sacca). He analyses every phenomenon into its ultimateconstituents. All relative concepts such as man, mountain, etc. arereduced to their ultimate elements which are then precisely defined,classified and systematically arranged.Thus in Abhidhamma everything is expressed in terms of khandhas,five aggregates of existence; æyatanas, five sensory organs and mind, andtheir respective sense objects; dhætu, elements; indriya, faculties; sacca,fundamental truths; and so on. Relative conceptual objects such as man,woman, etc. are resolved into ultimate components of khandhas,æyatanas, etc. and viewed as an impersonal psycho-physicalphenomenon, which is conditioned by various factors and is impermanent(anicca), suffering (dukkha) and is without a permanent entity (anatta).Having resolved all phenomena into ultimate componentsanalytically (as in Dhammasa³ga¼ø and Vibha³ga) it aims at synthesis bydefining inter-relations (paccaya) between the various constituent factors(as in Pa¥¥hæna). Thus Abhidhamma forms a gigantic edifice ofknowledge relating to the ultimate realities which, in its immensity ofscope, grandeur, subtlety, and profundity, properly belongs only to theintellectual domain of the Buddha."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"147(b) The seven books of Abhidhamma.The Suttanta Pi¥aka also contains discourses dealings withanalytical discussions and conditional relationship of the five aggregates.Where the need arises subjects such as the five aggregates, æyatanas, etc.are mentioned in the sutta discourses. But they are explained only brieflyby what is known as the Sutta Method of Analysis (Suttanta bhæjanøya),giving bare definitions with limited descriptions. For example, khandhas,the five aggregates, are enumerated as the corporeal aggregate, theaggregate of sensation, the aggregate of perception; the aggregate ofmental formations (volitional activities) and the aggregate ofconsciousness. They may be dealt with a little more comprehensively; forinstance, the corporeal aggregate may be further defined as corporealityof the past, the present or the future; the corporeality which is internal orexternal, coarse or fine, inferior or superior, far or near. The SuttaMethod of Analysis does not usually go further than this definition.But the Abhidhamma approach is more thorough, more penetrating,breaking down each corporeal or mental component into the ultimate, themost infinitesimal unit. For example, Rþpakkhandha, corporealaggregate, has been analysed into twenty-eight constituents;Vedanækkhandha, the aggregate of sensation, into five; Saññækkhandha,the aggregate of perception, into six; Sankhærakkhandha, the aggregate ofmental formations, into fifty; and Viññænakkhandha, the aggregate ofconsciousness, into eighty-nine. Then each constituent part is minutelydescribed with its properties and qualities and its place in the wellarranged system of classification is defined.A complete description of things requires also a statement of howeach component part stands in relation to other component parts. Thisentails therefore a synthetical approach as well, to study the inter-relationship between constituent parts and how they are related to otherinternal or external factors.Thus the Abhidhamma approach covers a wide field of study,consisting of analytical and synthetical methods of investigation,describing and defining minutely the constituent parts of aggregates,classifying them under well ordered heads and well arranged systems andfinally setting out conditions in which they are related to each other. Sucha large scope of intellectual endeavour needs to be encompassed in avoluminous and classified compilation.

It is a minutely detailed study of the doctrine ofconditionality, based on twenty-four paccayas, conditions or relations.(c) Conventional Truth (Sammuti Sacca) and Ultimate Truth (ParamatthaSacca).Two kinds of Truth are recognised in the Abhidhamma according towhich only four categories of things namely, mind (consciousness),mental concomitants, Materiality and Nibbæna are classed as the UltimateTruth; all the rest are regarded as apparent truth. When we use suchexpressions as 'I', 'you', 'man', 'woman', 'person', 'individual', we arespeaking about things which do not exist in reality. By using suchexpressions about things which exist only in designation, we are nottelling a lie; we are merely speaking an apparent truth, making use ofconventional language, without which no communication will bepossible.But the Ultimate Truth is that there is no 'person', 'individual' or'I' in reality. There exist only khandhas made up of corporeality, mind(consciousness) and mental concomitants. These are real in that they arenot just designations, they actually exist in us or around us."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"149Chapter XABHIDHAMMA PI¿AKAI. The Dhammasa³ga¼ø Pæ¹iThe Dhammasa³ga¼ø, the first book of the Abhidhamma, and thePa¥¥hæna, the last book, are the most important of the seven treatises ofAbhidhamma, providing as they do the quintessence of the entireAbhidhamma.Scheme of Classification in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø(1) The MætikæThe Dhammasa³ga¼ø enumerates all the dhammas (phenomena)i.e., all categories of næma, namely, Consciousness and mentalconcomitant, and rþpa, Corporeality. Having enumerated the phenomena,they are arranged under different heads to bring out their exact nature,function and mutual relationship both internally (in our own being) andwith the outside world. The Dhammasa³ga¼ø begins with a complete listof heads called the Mætikæ. The Mætikæ serves as a classified table ofmental constituents treated not only in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø but in theentire system of the Abhidhamma.The Mætikæ consists altogether of one hundred and twenty-twogroups, of which the first twenty-two are called the Tikas or Triads, thosethat are divided under three heads; and the remaining one hundred arecalled the Dukas or Dyads, those that are divided under two heads.Examples of Triads are:(a) Kusala Tika: dhammas(i) that are moral, kusala,(ii) that are immoral, akusala,(iii) that are indeterminate, abyækata.(b) Vedanæ Tika: dhammas that(i) with pleasant feeling, are associated (ii) with painful feeling,(iii) with neutral feeling."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"150Examples of Dyads are:(a) Hetu Duka: dhammas(i) that are roots, hetus(ii) the are not roots, na-hetu.(b) Sahetuka Duka: dhammas(i) that are associated with the hetus(ii) that are not associated with the hetus.The Mætikæ concludes with a list of the categories of dhammaentitled Suttantika Mætikæ made up of forty-two groups of dhamma foundin the suttas.(2) The four DivisionsBased on these Mætikæs of Tikas and Dukas, the Dhammasa³ga¼øis divided into four Divisions: (i) Cittuppæda Ka¼ðaDivision on the arising of consciousness and mental concomitants. (ii) Rþpa Ka¼ðaDivision concerning corporeality. (iii) Nikkhepa Ka¼ðaDivision that avoids elaboration. (iv) A¥¥hakathæ Ka¼ðaDivision of Supplementary Digest.Of the four divisions, the first two, namely, Cittuppæda Ka¼ða andRþpa Ka¼ða form the main and essential portion of the book. They setthe model of thorough investigation into the nature, properties, functionand interrelationship of each of the dhammas listed in the Mætikæ, byproviding a sample analysis and review of the first Tika, namely, theKusala Tika of Kusala, Akusala and Abyækata Dhamma. CittuppædaKa¼ða deals with a complete enumeration of all the states of mind thatcome under the headings of Kusala and Akusala; the Rþpa Ka¼ða isconcerned with all states of matter that come under the heading ofAbyækata; mention is also made of Asa³khata Dhætu (Nibbæna) withoutdiscussing it.The Nikkhepa Ka¼ða the third division, gives, not too elaboratelynor too briefly, the summary of distribution of all the Tikas and Dukas, sothat their full contents and significance will become comprehensible andfully covered."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"151A¥¥hakathæ Ka¼ða, the last division of the book, is of the samenature as the third division, giving a summary of the dhammas under thedifferent heads of the Tika and the Duka groups. But it provides it in amore condensed manner, thus forming a supplementary digest of the firstbook of the Abhidhamma for easy memorizing.(3) Order and classification of the types of Consciousness as discussed inCittuppæda Ka¼ða.The Cittuppæda Ka¼ða first gives a statement of the types ofConsciousness arranged under the three heads of the first Tika, namely,(i) Kusala Dhamma i.e., Meritorious Consciousness and its concomitants(ii) Akusala Dhamma i.e., Demeritorious Consciousness and itsconcomitants (iii) Abyækata Dhamma i.e., Indeterminate Consciousnessand its concomitants. The list of mental concomitants for each dhamma isfairly long and repetitive.The statement of the types of Consciousness is followed byidentification of the particular type e.g. Kusala Dhamma, in the form ofquestion and answer, with regard to the plane or sphere (bhþmi) ofConsciousness: Kæmævacara, sensuous plane; Rþpævacara, plane of form;Arþpævacara, plane of no-form; Tebhþmaka, pertaining to all the threeplanes; or Lokuttara, supramundane, not pertaining to the three planes.The type of Consciousness for each plane is further divided intovarious kinds e.g., there are eight kinds of Kusala Dhamma for thesensuous plane: first Kusala Citta, second Kusala Citta etc; twelve kindsof Akusala Citta; eight kinds of Ahetuka Kusala Vipæka Citta and eightkinds of Sahetuka Vipæka Citta under the heading of Abyækata Dhamma.Then these various kinds are further analysed according to:(i) Dhamma Vavatthæna Vara e.g., the particular quality, whetheraccompanied by joy etc. i.e., somanassa, domanassa, sukha, dukkha, orupekkhæ.(ii) Ko¥¥hæsa Væra, the grouping of dhammas. There are twenty-threecategories of dhammas which result from synthetical grouping ofdhammas into separate categories such as khandhas, æyatanas, dhætus etc.(iii) Suññata Væra, which lays stress on the fact that there is no'self’' (atta) or jøva behind all these dhammas; they are only composites,causally formed and conditioned, devoid of any abiding substance.The same method of treatment is adopted for the akusala andabyækata types of Consciousness."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"152(4) Rþpa Ka¼ðaBecause Dhammasa³ga¼ø treats all the dhammas (næmas as well asrþpas) in the same uniform system of classification, Rþpa Ka¼ða is onlya continuation of the distribution of the Dhamma under the heads of thefirst Tika, which begins in the first division, Cittuppæda Ka¼ða. In theCittuppæda Ka¼ða, the enumeration of the Dhamma under the head'Abyækata' has been only partially done, because abyækata type ofDhamma includes not only all the states of mind which are neithermeritorious nor demeritorious but also all states of matter and theAsa³khata Dhætu or Nibbæna. The portion of Dhamma under the headingof Abyækata, which has been left out from Cittuppæda Ka¼ða, is attendedto in this ka¼ða.The method of treatment here is similar, with the difference thatinstead of mental concomitants, the constituents of matter, namely, thefour primary elements and the material qualities derived from them withtheir properties and their relationships are analysed and classified.II. Vibha³ga Pæ¹iBook of AnalysisThe second book of the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka, Vibha³ga, togetherwith the first book Dhammasa³ga¼ø and the third book Dhætukathæ,forms a closely related foundation for the proper and deep understandingof the Buddha's Dhamma. Whereas Dhammasa³ga¼ø provides a bird'seye view of the whole of the Tika and Duka groups with furthersystematic arrangements under classified heads, Vibha³ga andDhætukathæ give a closer view of selected portions of those groupsbringing out minute details.Thus, Ko¥¥hæsa Væra in Dhammasa³ga¼ø explains what and howmany khandha, æyatana, dhætu, æhæra, indriya, jhæna³ga etc. areincluded in the Tika and Duka groups. But it does not furnish completeinformation about these dhammas. It is Vibha³ga which provides fullknowledge concerning them, stating the exact nature of each dhamma, itsconstituents and its relationship to other dhammas.The Vibha³ga is divided into eighteen Chapters each dealing with aparticular aspect of the Dhamma; its full analysis and investigation intoeach constituent. The arrangement and classification into groups and"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"153heads follow the same system as in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø. Vibha³ga maytherefore be regarded as complementary to Dhammasa³ga¼ø.Vibha³ga explains comprehensively the following categories ofDhamma. (i) Khandha (x) Bojjha³ga(ii) Æyatana  (xi) Magga(iii) Dhætu  (xii) Jhæna(iv) Sacca  (xiii) Appammaññæ(v) Indriya  (xiv) Sikkhæpada(vi) Paticcasamuppæda (xv) Pa¥isaμbhidæ(vii) Satipa¥¥hæna (xvi) Ñæ¼a(viii) Sammappadhæna (xvii) Khuddhaka vatthu(ix) Iddhipæda (xviii) DhammahadayaEach category is analysed end discussed in two or all the three ofthe following methods of analysis: Suttanta bhæjanøya — the meaning ofthe terms and the classification of the dhammas determined according tothe Suttanta method; Abhidhamma bhæjanøya — the meaning of the termsand the classification of the dhammas determined according to theAbhidhamma method; Pañha pucchaka, discussions in the form ofquestions and answers.It may be seen from the above list of the eighteen categories thatthey may be divided into three separate groups. The first groupcontaining numbers (i)-(vi) deals with mental and corporeal constituentsof beings and two laws of nature to which they are constantly subjectedviz: the Law of Impermanence and the Law of Dependent Origination.The second group containing numbers (vii)-(xii) is concerned with thepractice of the holy life which will take beings out of suffering androunds of existence. The remaining six categories serve as a supplementto the first two groups, supplying fuller information and details wherenecessary."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"154III. Dhætukathæ Pæ¹iAlthough this third book of Abhidhamma Pi¥aka is a small treatise,it ranks with the first two books forming an important trilogy, which mustbe thoroughly digested for the complete understanding of theAbhidhamma. Vibha³ga, the second book, has one complete chapterdevoted to the analysis of dhætus, but the subject matter of dhætu is soimportant that this separate treatise is devoted to it for a thoroughconsideration. The method of analysis here is different from thatemployed in the Vibha³ga.Dhætukathæ studies how the dhammas listed in the Tikas and Dukasof the Mætikæ are related to the three categories of khandha, æyatana anddhætu in their complete distribution i.e., five khandhas, twelve æyatanasand eighteen dhætus. These are discussed in fourteen ways of analyticalinvestigations which constitute the fourteen chapters of Dhætukathæ.IV. Puggalapaññatti Pæ¹iAbhidhamma is mainly concerned with the study of abstract truthsin absolute terms. But in describing the dhammas in their various aspects,it is not possible to keep to absolute terms only. Inevitably, conventionalterms of every day language have to be employed in order to keep thelines of communication open at all. Abhidhamma states that there are twomain types of conventional usage; the first type is concerned with termswhich express things that actually exist in reality and the second typedescribes things which have no existence in reality.The first three books of the Abhidhamma investigate the absoluteTruth of Dhamma in a planned system of detailed analysis employingsuch terms as Khandha, Æyatana, Dhætu, Sacca and Indriya. These termsare mere designations which express things that exist in reality and aretherefore classed as the conventional usage of the first type. To thesecond type of conventional usage belong such expressions as man,woman, deva, individual etc., which have no existence in reality, butnevertheless are essential for communication of thoughts.It becomes necessary therefore to distinguish between these twotypes of apparent truths. But as the terms Khandha, Æyatana, Dhætu,Sacca and Indriya have been elaborately dealt with in the first threebooks, they are dealt with here only briefly. The terms used in the second"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"155type concerning individuals are given more weight and space in thetreatise, hence its title Puggalapaññatti, designation of individuals.Different types of individuals are classified, in ten chapters of the book,after the manner of enumeration employed in A³guttara Nikæya.V. Kathævatthu Pæ¹iKathævatthu, like Puggalapaññatti, falls outside the regular systemof the Abhidhamma. It does not directly deal with the abstruse nature ofthe Dhamma. It is mainly concerned with wrong views such as \"Personexists; Self exists; Jøva exists\" which were prevalent even in theBuddha's time, or wrong views such as \"Arahat falls away fromArahatship\" which arose after the Parinibbæna of the Buddha.About two hundred and eighteen years after the Parinibbæna of theBuddha there were altogether Eighteen Sects, all claiming to be followersof the Buddha's Teaching. Of these only the Theravædins were trulyorthodox, while the rest were all schismatic. The Emperor Asoka setabout removing the impure elements from the Order with the guidanceand assistance of the Elder Moggaliputtatissa who was an accomplishedArahat. Under his direction, the Order held in concord the Uposathaceremony which had not been held for seven years because of dissensionsand the presence of false bhikkhus in the Order.At that assembly, the Venerable Moggaliputtatissa expounded onpoints of views, made up of five hundred orthodox statements and fivehundred statements of other views, in order to refute the wrong views thathad crept into the Saμgha and that might in the future arise. He followedthe heads of discourses, Mætikæ, outlined by the Buddha himself andanalysed them in detail into one thousand statements of views. Thiscollection of statements of views was recited by one thousand selectedtheras who formed the Third Great Synod, to be incorporated into theAbhidhamma Pi¥aka.The style of compilation of this treatise is quite different from thatof other treatises, written as it is in the form of dialogue between twoimaginary debators, one holding the heterodox views of different sectsand the other representing the orthodox views."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"156VI. Yamaka Pæ¹iThe Dhammasa³ga¼ø, the Vibha³ga and the Dhætukathæ examinethe Dhamma and their classifications as they exist in the world of reality,named Sa³khæraloka. Puggalapaññatti and Kathævatthu deal with beingsand individuals which also exist in their own world of apparent reality,known as Sattaloka. Where the dhamma of Sa³khæraloka and beings ofthe Sattaloka co-exist is termed the Okæsaloka. Yamaka sets out to defineand analyse the interrelationship of dhammas and puggalas as they existin these three worlds.This is accomplished in the form of pairs of questions, which givesit the title of Yamaka. The logical process of conversion (anuloma) andcomplete inversion (pa¥iloma) is applied to determine the completeimport and limit of a term in its relationship with the others. Anequivocal nature of a term (saμsaya) is avoided by showing, throughsuch arrangement of questions, how other meanings of the term do not fitfor a particular consideration.The following pairs of questions may be taken as an example:To the question 'May all rþpa be called Rþpakkhanda?' the answeris 'Rþpa is also used in such expressions as piya rþpa (loveable nature),eva rþpa (of such nature), but there it does not mean Rþpakkhandha.'But to the question 'May all Rþpakkhandha be called rþpa?' theanswer is 'yes', because Rþpakkhandha is a very wide term and includessuch terms as piya rþpa, eva rþpa etc.VII. Pa¥¥hæna Pæ¹iPa¥¥hæna Pæ¹i, the seventh and last book of the Abhidhamma, iscalled the Mahæ Pakæra¼a, the 'Great Book' announcing the supremeposition it occupies and the height of excellence it has reached in itsinvestigations into the ultimate nature of all the dhammas in theUniverse.The Dhammasa³ga¼ø gives an enumeration of these dhammasclassifying them under the Tika and Duka groups.

The Great Treatise of Pa¥¥hæna arranges all conditioned things,(twenty-two Tikas and one hundred Dukas of the Mætikæ), under twenty-four kinds of relations, describes and classifies them into a completesystem for understanding the mechanics of the universe of Dhamma. Thewhole work is divided into four great divisions, namely:(i) Anuloma Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances in which paccaya relations do exist between the dhammas.(ii) Paccanøya Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances in which paccaya relations do not exist between the dhammas.(iii) Anuloma Paccanøya Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances in which some of the paccaya relations do exist between the dhamma s but the others do not.(iv) Paccanøya Anuloma Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances in which some of the paccaya relations do not exist between the dhammas, but the others do exist."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"158The twenty-four paccaya relations are applied to these four greatdivisions in the following six ways:(i) Tika Pa¥¥hæna The twenty-four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in their twenty-four Tika groups.(ii) Duka Pa¥¥hæna The twenty-four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in their one hundred Duka groups.(iii) Duka-Tika Pa¥¥hæna The twenty four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in their one hundred Dukas mixed with twenty-two Tika groups.(iv) Tika-Duka Pa¥¥hæna The twenty-four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in their twenty-two Tikas mixed with one hundred Duka groups.(v) Tika-Tika Pa¥¥hæna The twenty-four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in the twenty-two Tika groups mixed with one another.(vi) Duka-Duka Pa¥¥hæna The twenty-four paccayas are applied to the dhammas in their one hundred Duka groups mixed with one another.The four pa¥¥hænas of the four great divisions when permuted withthe six pa¥¥hænas of the six ways result in twenty-four treatises which con-stitute the gigantic compilation of abstract Abhidhamma known as theMahæpakæra¼a or as the commentary and sub-commentary name it \"Ananta-naya Samanta Pa¥¥hæna\" to denote its profundity and fathomless depth.THE END"}]
