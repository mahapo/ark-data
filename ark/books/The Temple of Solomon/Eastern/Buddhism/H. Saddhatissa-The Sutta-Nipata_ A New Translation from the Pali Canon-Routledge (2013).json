The present version is, therefore,presented for the consideration of readers who may find traditionalinterpretations inhibiting.During my time at the universities of Benares (India) and Toronto (Canada) Itaught the Sutta-Nipāta to undergraduates there. It was at this period that Ibegan the first draft of this work, the first four chapters of which have beenserialized in Buddhist Quarterly (now Buddhist Forum) the journal of the BritishMahābodhi Society. It should be understood that it is not a strict translationbut rather a rendering of the spirit of the suttas. In particular, I haveabbreviated where there are frequent repetitions in the original.In this task I must express indebtedness to three friends who polished thelanguage and helped prepare the final manuscript: Robert Barnett (grandson ofthe late L.D. Barnett, Professor of Sanskrit in the University of London andKeeper of Oriental Printed Books at the British Museum); Dr P.D. Premasiri ofthe Department of Philosophy, University of Peradeniya (Sri Lanka); and RussellWebb (Honorary Secretary of the British Mahābodhi Society, London BuddhistVihara).London, September 1985 H. SADDHĀTISSA"},{"pageContent":"Introduction [part0003.html#intro]The canonical texts of the Theravādin school of Buddhism (the predominantreligious tradition of South-East Asia and well represented in the West),collectively known as the Pali Canon, are divided into three main sections:Vinaya (the disciplinary rules and procedures governing the behaviour and dailylife of the monks), Sutta (the discourses of the Buddha or his foremost ordaineddisciples addressed to both monks and lay followers) and Abhidhamma (thedeveloped psychological writings which are generally acknowledged to post-datethe historical Buddha’s lifetime, c.560-c.480 B.C.). All these texts weretransmitted orally and only committed to ola leaf manuscripts in modern SriLanka (ancient Ceylon) in the first century B.C.The collection of suttas is, in turn, sub-divided into five sections: DīghaNikāya — which comprises long, mainly narrative discourses. Majjhima Nikāya —medium length discourses which are generally regarded as the most important fromthe standpoint of the practical application of the Dhamma (or Doctrine/Teachingof the Buddha). Saṃyutta Nikāya — detailed Dhamma prescriptions arranged insubject order.Aṅguttara Nikāya — compressed narrative discourses which expound the Dhamma innumerical sequences.Khuddaka Nikāya — which comprises fifteen individual books of which the bestknown is the Dhammapada (in over thirty English translations) and one of themost formative and influential, the Sutta-Nipāta.Vernacular translations from Pali (the common tongue related to a Prakritlanguage in which the Buddha was reputed to use) as opposed to Sanskrit, theone-time preserve of the Indian brahmins, have been produced in Indian andSouth-East Asian languages and, during the last 150 years, Japanese and Europeanlanguages. However, it is only in English that the Canon has appeared almost inits entirety, due primarily to the efforts of the Pali Text Society (f. 1881)which is currently arranging for the complete translation of the traditionalCommentaries.Despite the foregoing, no completely lucid English translation of theSutta-Nipāta has been made. A number of analytical studies have been produced byPali scholars who have carefully examined the text’s linguistic and historicalfeatures and its place in the Canon.From such researches we can recognize four stages of literary development:The (philosophical) Ascetic stageThe (disciplinary) Monastic stageThe (religious) Moralistic stageThe (commentarial) ‘Legendary’ stageThe first stage, embodied by the oldest strata of the Sutta-Nipāta (i.e. I 3, IVand V), was represented by the Buddha and his fellow ‘homeless ones’ who led aneremitic existence. His teaching was austere and stoical so as to lead tosteadfastness of purpose and endeavour which would culminate in the finalrelease from the unsatisfactoriness of mundane life — the mental state ofNibbāna (Nirvāna) — which could (and can) be attained here and now. Moderationand self-control were extolled; desire, prejudice and ill-will were repudiated;traditionalism was eschewed, despised, and rigid rules were regarded as fetters,as hindrances to that personal liberty of the spirit which is the hall mark ofpermanent Deliverance.The specific text under consideration combines numerous features which make fora timeless and wider appeal than has hitherto been allowed for it: an analysisof psychological motivations which provides a refreshingly modern insight intohuman nature; an emphasis on mental detachment from the distractions of life;empirically-orientated philosophy which is subject to verifiable realization;fundamental doctrines of the Dhamma presented in a non-scholastic,unsystematized form; rationally-based exhortations to lead a balanced, ethicallife; biographical sketches of the Light of Asia and vignettes of daily life inancient India. All these features are couched in dialogue form, narrative proseor devotional verse, devoid of pedantry, niggling rules and regulations,repetitive or stereotyped stock formulae which appear elsewhere in later strataof the canonical texts.The whole text conveys an atmosphere untrammelled by inhibiting conventions andwith an emphasis on positive striving towards the desired goals of spiritualfreedom and non-attachment. With its direct appeal to individual effort andself-discovery, as opposed to current commercialized and populist blandishments,this straightforward didactic work has a particular relevance today when a newgeneration is seeking a practical path leading to a purposeful life.The numbers in parenthesis at the right of each verse correspond with theconsecutive numbers of the stanzas as they appeared in the original text."},{"pageContent":"List of Suttas [part0003.html#l1]I.

In similar stanzas, thesecond and fourth similes have been given in the second part. On the analogy ofthese two stanzas, therefore, I feel that the reading has been corrupt, evenduring the Commentary period. I would suggest that it reads as saritaṃsīghasaraṃ va sosayitvā and have translated it accordingly.3 [part0007.html#en-1a_3] Sensuality, ill-will, physical and mental laziness, restlessness and worry,scepticism.2. Dhaniya Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_2]Dhaniya the Herdsman [part0006.html#s1_2]A dialogue between Dhaniya and the Buddha, the one rejoicing in his worldlysecurity and the other in his spiritual freedomDhaniya was a herdsman who lived at the time when the Buddha was staying atSāvatthi. It was the monsoon season, just before the onset of rain. He had builtstrong shelters for himself, his family and for the cattle on the bank of theRiver Mahī. The Buddha, however, realized that this family was in danger ofbeing overwhelmed by the flood and appeared in the cattle-keeper’s shelter justwhen he was rejoicing in his comfort and security:1 Dhaniya: I have cooked my rice and milked the cows. I dwell with my peoplenear the bank of the Mahī. My house is thatched, the fire is kindled. Therefore,rain, O cloud, if you like!(18)2 The Buddha: I am free from anger, free from passion. I abide for the nightnear the bank of the river Mahī. My house [body] is uncovered, the fire ofpassion is extinguished. Therefore, rain, O cloud, if you like!(19)3 Dhaniya: Gadflies and mosquitoes are not to be found. My meadows are aboundingwith grass on the marshy land. The cattle can endure the rain when it comes.Therefore, rain, O cloud, if you like!(20)4 The Buddha: By me is made a well-constructed raft [path]. I have passed overthe floods to Nibbāna. There is no further use of the raft. Therefore, rain, Ocloud, if you like!(21)5 Dhaniya: Gopi, my wife, is not wanton and is obedient to me. For a long timeshe has lived with me pleasantly. Of her, I do not hear any evil whatever.(22)6 The Buddha: My mind is obedient and is free from passion. For a long time ithas been trained and well subdued. So evil is not to be found in me.(23)7 Dhaniya: I am self-employed and support myself. My sons are all healthy. Aboutthem I do not hear any evil whatever.(24)8 The Buddha: I am no one’s servant. With the gaining of my object [Buddhahood]I wander through the world; there is no need for me to serve.(25)9 Dhaniya: I have young bulls and calves, also cows in calf and heifers, and abull who is leader of the herd.(26)10 The Buddha: I have neither young bulls nor calves, neither cows in calf norheifers, nor a bull who is leader of the herd.(27)11 Dhaniya: The stakes are firmly fixed. The ropes made of muimage[../images/00004.jpeg]ja grass are new and well made. Even the young calves arenot able to break them.(28)12 The Buddha: Having broken the fetters like a bull, as an elephant havingbroken the pūtilatā creepers, so there will be no more rebirth for me.(29)13 (Then all of a sudden a shower poured down, filling all the levels andhollows. Hearing the roaring of the storm Dhaniya spoke the following words:)(30)14 Great, indeed is the gain that we see the Blessed one, the Omniscient One, toyou we come for refuge, O Great Seer, be our refuge!(31)15 Both my wife and I will be obedient to you in the dispensation of Sugata, theWelcome One. We shall lead the Holy Life; overcoming birth and death we willmake an end of suffering.(32)16 Māra1 [part0007.html#en-1b_1] now appeared to tempt him: He who has childrendelights on account of the children. He who has cattle likewise delights onaccount of cattle. For the delights of man are on account of elements of sensoryexistence (upadhi) alone. He who has no upadhi has no delight.(33)17 The Buddha: He who has children has grief on account of his children. He whohas cattle has grief on account of cattle. For upadhi is the cause of thesorrows of men, but he who has no upadhi has no sorrow.(34)Note1 [part0007.html#en1b_1] Māra literally means ‘the killer’ or ‘bringer of death’. In Buddhist literature‘passion’, ‘anger’, ‘temptation’, ‘temper’ or ‘evils’ have been personified asMāra (the Evil One). From the time of the Buddha’s enlightenment until hisparinibbāna, Māra made his appearance on various occasions assuming divine,human or even animal forms. According to Buddhist literature there are fivekinds of Māra: (i) the five aggregates, (ii) kammic activities, (iii) death,(iv) mental defilements, and (v) a deity. In this instance the term is used inthe sense of ‘passion’ or ‘evils’ personified. His army consists of ten forces:(i) sense desire, (ii) discontent, (iii) hunger and thirst, (iv) craving, (v)lethargy and drowsiness, (vi) cowardice, (vii) uncertainty, (viii) distractionand obstinacy, (ix) gain, praise, honour and undeserved fame, and (x) theextolling of oneself whilst disparaging others.3.

Kasībhāradvāja Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_4]The farmer Bhāradvāja [part0006.html#s1_4]Kasībhāradvāja reproaches the Buddha with idleness but the latter convinces himthat he also worksThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was dwelling in a brahmin village calledEkanāḷā situated in the district of Dakkhiṇāgiri in the country of Magadha.At that time, being the sowing season, five hundred ploughs owned by the brahminKasībhāradvāja were set to work. In the morning then, the Buddha, having robedhimself and taking his bowl and (double-layered) robe, went to that place whereKasībhāradvāja’s work was in progress. It was lunch time and the food was beingdistributed by the brahmin. When the Buddha arrived at the place where the foodwas being distributed he stood aside. The brahmin, seeing the Buddha standingfor alms, said thus: ‘O recluse, I plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown,I eat. You also, recluse, should plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown,you should eat.’‘I too, brahmin, plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown, I eat.’‘We see neither yoke, nor plough, nor ploughshare, nor goad, nor oxen of theVenerable Gotama, and yet you say: “I too, brahmin, plough and sow; and havingploughed and sown, I eat.”’ There upon Kasībhāradvāja addressed the Buddha inthis stanza:1 ‘You claim to be a farmer, yet we do not see your ploughing. Being questionedby us about your ploughing, tell us in such a manner that we may know of it.’(76)2 ‘Confidence is the seed; self-control the rein; wisdom my yoke and plough;modesty is my pole; mind is the rope; mindfulness my ploughshare and goad.(77)3 ‘Bodily action is well-guarded, speech is well-guarded, moderate in food, Imake truth the destroyer of weeds and calm my release.(78)4 ‘Exertion is my yoked-oxen which carries me towards Nibbāna. It goes onwardwithout stopping; having gone there one has no regrets.(79)5 ‘In this way the ploughing is done; it bears the fruit of immortality. Havingaccomplished this ploughing, one becomes free from all suffering.’(80)Then Kasībhāradvāja filled a large golden bowl with milk-rice and offered it tothe Buddha, saying: ‘Let the Venerable Gotama eat the milk-rice. You are afarmer by reason of that ploughing; it bears indeed the fruit of immortality. ‘6 ‘What is obtained by chanting hymns is not to be eaten by me. This is,brahmin, not the practice of those who see rightly. The Buddhas refuse what isobtained by chanting hymns.(81)7 ‘You should serve other food and drink to an accomplished great sage who isfree from the mental impurities and remorse. That is the field for him who seeksmerits.’(82)‘Then, Venerable Gotama, to whom should I give this milk-rice?’‘Brahmin, in the world which includes gods, Māras, Brahmas, and among brahminsand men I do not see anyone except a Tathāgata1 [part0007.html#en1d_1] or adisciple of a Tathāgata, by whom this milk-rice, when eaten, can be properlydigested.‘Therefore, O brahmin, you had better cast this milk-rice either in a placewhere there is no grass or float it in water where there are no livingcreatures.’So Kasībhāradvāja floated the milk-rice in water which contained no lifewhereupon it made a hissing sound with much steam and smoke emanating from allsides, just as a ploughshare when heated all day and plunged into water producesa hissing sound and emits steam and smoke on all sides.Then Kasībhāradvāja, greatly excited and with hair standing on end, approachedthe Buddha and fell with his head at the Master’s feet, saying: ‘It is amazing,Venerable Gotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if one might raisewhat has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the wayto him who has gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so that those whohave eyes may see objects, so likewise has the Truth been explained by VenerableGotama in various ways. Therefore, I take refuge in him, his Dhamma and hisSangha.2 [part0007.html#en1d_2] I wish to enter the homeless life and to receivethe higher ordination near the Venerable Gotama.’Then Kasībhāradvāja received ordination as a novice and received the higherordination near the Buddha.Later, by leading a secluded life, diligently, energetically and with a resolutewill, in a short time he understood, experienced and attained that highestperfection of a noble life for which the sons of good families leave thehousehold life, harmoniously and take to the life of homelessness. Rebirth hadbeen ended; a noble life had been led; what was to be done had been done andthere was nothing else to be done in this earthly existence: Kasībhāradvāja hadbecome one of the arahants [perfected ones].Notes1 [part0007.html#en-1d_1] The term used by the Buddha when referring to himself.

Cunda Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_5]Cunda the Smith [part0006.html#s1_5]The Buddha describes the four kinds of monks1 Cunda: I ask the sage Buddha of great wisdom, Lord of Dhamma, who is free fromcraving, the noblest of men, the noblest of guides; how many kinds of monks arethere in the world? Please tell me.(83)2 The Buddha: Cunda, there are four kinds of monks, not a fifth. I shallelucidate them to you, since you ask me: (i) one kind has won the Path, (ii) oneexpounds the Path, (iii) one lives on the Path, and (iv) one defiles the Path.(84)3 Cunda: Whom does the Buddha describe as one who has won the Path? How does theone who expounds the Path become incomparable? Tell me about the one who liveson the Path and then explain to me the one who defiles the Path.(85)4 The Buddha: One who overcomes uncertainty, is freed from sorrow, delights inNibbāna, is detached, a guide of men and gods — such a person is said by theBuddhas to be one who has won the Path.(86)5 Here, one knows Nibbāna as the noblest (state) and expounds and explains theDhamma; that sage who destroys uncertainty, is desireless — this second of monksis called the one who expounds the Path.(87)6 One who has controlled himself mindfully, lives well on the Path according tothe words of Dhamma well expounded; one who practises correct principles — thisthird of monks is called the one who lives on the Path.(88)7 One who disguises himself by wearing the robes of the well-conducted ones,travels for gain, disgraces families, is impudent, deceitful, unrestrained, agossip and waffler pretending to be a real monk — he is one who defiles thePath.(89)8 Having comprehended these (four) he who is well-versed, house-holder, who is anoble, wise disciple and who has understood that ‘all of them are not alike’;seeing thus, he does not diminish his confidence. How could the defiled one andthe undefiled one, the pure and the impure one, be considered as equals?(90)6. Parābhava Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_6]Downfall [part0006.html#s1_6]A dialogue between a deity and the Buddha on the causes of spiritual declineThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was living near Sāvaṭṭhi in the Jeta Grove atAnāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, one beautiful night, a certain devatā, havingilluminated the whole Jeta Grove with surpassing splendour, came to the Buddhaand, making salutations, stood on one side and uttered these words:1 I wish to ask you, Gotama, about a person who suffers downfall. I haveapproached you in order to inquire as to the causes of downfall.(91)The Buddha:2 Easily known is the progressive one, easily known the one who declines. He wholoves Dhamma progresses, he who hates it declines.(92)1 [part0007.html#en-1e_1]4 One who loves the company of the vicious finds no delight with the virtuous;he prefers the doctrine of the vicious — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(94)6 Being fond of sleep, talkative, lethargic, lazy and irritable — this is acause of one’s downfall.(96)8 He who being sufficiently affluent does not support his father and mother whoare old and infirm — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(98)10 He who deceives by falsehood a priest, monk or any other spiritual preceptor— this is the cause of one’s downfall.(100)12 Having ample wealth, assets and property, enjoying them alone — this is acause of one’s downfall.(102)14 If a man is conceited through his birth, wealth or community and looks downon his own kith and kin — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(104)16 To be a womaniser, a drunkard, a gambler, and to squander all one earns —this is a cause of one’s downfall.(106)18 Not to be contented with one’s wife but to be seen with a prostitute or thewives of others — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(108)20 Being past one’s youth, to take a young wife and to be unable to sleep forjealousy of her — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(110)22 To place in authority a woman given to drink and squandering, or a man oflike behaviour — this is a cause of one’s downfall.(112)24 If a member of an influential family [or social or other grouping], with vastambition and of slender means, seeks power or control over others — this is acause of one’s downfall.(114)25 Reflecting thoroughly on those causes of downfall in the world, the wise one,endowed with insight, enjoys bliss in a happy state.(115)Notes1 [part0007.html#en1e_1] The questioning stanzas — 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111 and 113 —have been omitted.7. Vasala Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_7]1 [part0007.html#en1f_1]The Outcast [part0006.html#s1_7]The Buddha’s definition of a (spiritual) outcastThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was living near Sāvaṭṭhi in the Jeta Grove atAnāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, in the forenoon, having robed himself andtaking his bowl, he entered Sāvaṭṭhi for alms. At that time, in the house of theBrahmin Aggika-Bhāradvāja, the fire-worshipper, a fire was lit and the objectsfor sacrifice were made ready.Then the Buddha, going from house to house, came to that brahmin’s abode. Seeingthe Buddha approaching he shouted: ‘Stop there, shaveling, stop there, ascetic,stop there, outcast!’The Buddha (calmly replied): ‘O brahmin, can you recognize an outcast or knowthose things that constitute an outcast?’‘No, indeed, Master Gotama, I cannot recognize an outcast or know those thingsthat constitute an outcast. It would be profitable, therefore, Master Gotama, ifyou were to enlighten me on this matter’.The Buddha (continued): ‘Very well, brahmin, listen and bear well in your mindwhat follows:1 Whoever is angry, harbours ill-will, is evil-minded and envious; whose viewsare delusive, who is deceitful, he is to be known as an outcast.2[part0007.html#en1f_2](116)2 Whoever destroys life, whether bird or animal, insect or fish, has nocompassion for life. . .(117)3 Whoever is destructive or aggressive in town and country and is a known vandalor thug . . .(118)4 Whoever steals what is considered to belong to others, whether it be situatedin villages or the forest . . .(119)5 Whoever having contracted debts defaults when asked to pay, retorts, ‘I am notindebted to you!’ . . .(120)6 Whoever is desirous of stealing even a trifle and takes such a thing, havingkilled a man going along the road3 [part0007.html#en1f_3]. . .(121)7 Whoever commits perjury either for his own benefit, for that of others or forthe sake of profit . . .(122)8 Whoever has illicit affairs with the wives of his relatives or friends, eitherby force or through mutual consent . . .(123)9 Whoever does not support his father or mother, who are old and infirm, beinghimself in a prosperous position . . .(124)10 Whoever strikes or abuses by words either father, mother, brother, sister ormother-in-law . . .(125)11 Whoever being asked for good advice teaches what is misleading or speaks inobscure terms . . .(126)12 Whoever having committed an offence wishes to conceal it from others and is ahypocrite . . .(127)13 Whoever having gone to another’s house and taken advantage of the hospitalitythere does not reciprocate in like manner. . .(128)14 Whoever deceives a priest, monk or any other spiritual preceptor . . .(129)15 Whoever abuses by words and does not serve a priest or monk coming for a meal. . .(130)16 Whoever, being enmeshed in ignorance, makes untrue predictions for paltrygain . . .(131)17 Whoever exalts himself and despises others, smug in his self-conceit . . .(132)18 Whoever is a provoker (of quarrels) or is avaricious, has malicious desires,is envious, shameless and has no qualms in committing evil. . .(133)19 Whoever insults the Buddha or his disciples, whether renounced ones or laymen. . .(134)20 Whoever not being an arahant pretends to be one, he is indeed the greatestrogue in the whole world, the lowest outcast of all. Thus have I exposed thosewho are outcasts.(135)21 One does not become an outcast by birth, one does not become a brahmin bybirth. It is by deed that one becomes an outcast, it is by deed that one becomesa brahmin.(136)22 Now listen and I will give you an illustration. Once there was the son of anoutcast whose name was Mātaṅga of the Sopāka caste.(137)23 He attained the pinnacle of fame and when he had done so, warriors, brahminsand many others came to serve him.(138)24 Having destroyed worldly passions, he entered that Noble Path and reached theBrahmā world. Caste did not prevent him from being born in the heavenly realm.(139)25 Those brahmins who are familiar with the Vedas and who are born in a familywhich recites the Vedas, if they are addicted to evil deeds,(140)26 They are not only disgraced in this life itself but in the next they are bornin a state of suffering. Caste does not prevent them from disgrace or birth in apainful state.’(141)27 (Here, v.21 is repeated)(142)When the Buddha had spoken, the brahmin Aggika-Brāradvāja exclaimed: ‘It isamazing, Venerable Gotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if onemight raise what has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or pointout the way to him who has gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so thatthose who have eyes may see objects, so likewise has the Truth been explained byVenerable Gotama in various ways. Therefore, I take refuge in him, his Dhammaand his Sangha. May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower whohenceforth has taken refuge in him for the rest of his life!’Notes1 [part0007.html#en-1f_1] Also called the Aggika-Bhāradvāja Sutta.2 [part0007.html#en-1f_2] From 2 to 19 each stanza ends with the refrain, ‘he is to be known as anoutcast.’3 [part0007.html#en-1f_3] The earliest reference to ‘mugging’?8.

May all beings be happy and secure, may their hearts be wholesome!(145)4 – 5 Whatever living beings there be: feeble or strong, tall, stout or medium,short, small or large, without exception; seen or unseen, those dwelling far ornear, those who are born or those who are to be born, may all beings be happy!(146 – 7)6 Let none deceive another, not despise any person whatsoever in any place. Lethim not wish any harm to another out of anger or ill-will.(148)7 Just as a mother would protect her only child at the risk of her own life,even so, let him cultivate a boundless heart towards all beings.(149)8 Let his thoughts of boundless love pervade the whole world: above, below andacross without any obstruction, without any hatred, without any enmity.(150)9 Whether he stands, walks, sits or lies down, as long as he is awake, he shoulddevelop this mindfulness.

Thedivine night has approached. Let’s see Master Gotama, the teacher of perfectname.(153)2 The yakkha Hemavata says: Is the steadfast one’s mind well directed towardsall beings? Has he brought his thoughts as regards pleasant and unpleasantthings under his control?(154)3 Sātāgira: The steadfast one’s mind is well directed towards all beings.Moreover, he has brought his thoughts as regards pleasant and unpleasant thingsunder his control.(155)4 Hemavata: Does he not steal? Is he self-controlled towards living beings? Ishe far from being lethargic? Does he not give up meditation?(156)5 Sātāgira: He does not steal. His attitude is one of self-control towardsliving beings. He is far from being lethargic. The Enlightened One does notabandon meditation.(157)6 Hemavata: Does he not speak falsehood? Does he not use harsh words? Does henot say things which cause distress? Does he not indulge in frivolous talk?(158)7 Sātāgira: He does not speak falsehood. Neither does he use harsh words nordoes he say things which cause distress. He speaks [only] wise and usefulthings.(159)8 Hemavata: Is he not attached to worldly pleasures? Is his mind undisturbed?Has he overcome delusion? Has he acquired insight into all things?(160)9 Sātāgira: He is not attached to worldly pleasures. His mind is undisturbed?All his delusion has vanished. The Enlightened One possesses insight into allthings.(161)10 Hemavata: Is he endowed with knowledge? Is his conduct pure? Has he destroyedall passions? Has be brought to an end [the cycle of] rebirth?(162)11 Sātāgira: He is endowed with knowledge. His conduct is pure. He has destroyedall passions. He will not be subject to [further] rebirth.(163)12 Hemavata: The sage’s mind is filled with good speech and action. He possessesright knowledge and conduct. Let’s go and see Gotama!(164)13 The sage Gotama, limbed like the antelope, lean, firm, taking little food,not greedy, who meditates in the jungle. Let’s go and see him!(165)14 Having approached him, who is like a lion, who lives alone, who isindifferent to worldly pleasures, let’s ask for an escape from the snare ofdeath.(166)15 [Both speak] We ask Gotama, the Englightened One, who declares the Dhamma,who expounds the Dhamma, who has realized all truth, who has overcome hatred andfear.(167)16 Hemavata: Upon what is the world produced? With what is the world intimate;After having clung to what by what is the world troubled?(168)17 The Buddha: O Hemavata, in six is the world produced, with six is itintimate, after having clung to six by six the world is troubled.(169)18 Hemavata: What is that attachment by which the world is troubled? Please tellus the [means of] deliverance; how does the world escape from misery?(170)19 The Buddha: Having destroyed the desire of the five sensual pleasures in theworld, and that of mind, the sixth sense, one escapes from misery.(171)20 This is the salvation of the world — I have told you as it is. This alone Itell you: thus the world escapes from misery.(172)21 Hemavata: Who is the one who crosses the flood? Who is the one who crossesthe sea? Without a footing, and when not supported, who will not sink in thedeep ocean and sea?(173)22 The Buddha: One who is always virtuous, wise, well concentrated, reflectswithin himself, and mindful, he crosses the flood which is difficult to cross.(174)23 Abstaining from lustful thoughts and having broken all fetters, being one inwhom desire for existence is extinct, he will not sink into the deep.(175)24 Hemavata: Look at that great sage who possesses deep wisdom, who is subtle inrealizing the truth, passionless, not attached to worldly pleasures, free fromall fetters and who walks on the superhuman Path!(176)25 Look at that great sage of perfect name, who is subtle in realizing thetruth, who imparts wisdom, who is not attached to worldly pleasures, who is allknowing, whose wisdom is perfect, who walks on the noble Path!(177)26 A good sight indeed has arisen today, a good daybreak, a beautiful arising,for we have seen the perfectly Enlightened One, who has crossed the flood, whois free from passions.(178)27 These thousand spirits assembled here who possess supernatural power and fameall take refuge in you. You are our noble teacher.(179)28 Thus we shall wander from village to village and mountain to mountain payingour respects to the Enlightened One and to his doctrine which is well preached.(180)10. Āḷavaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec1_10]Āḷavaka [part0006.html#s1_10]Another demon first threatens the Buddha and then puts some questions to himwhich are answeredThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was dwelling in the residence of the yakkhaĀḷavaka near the town of Āḷavi. Then Āḷavaka came to the Buddha and shouted:‘Get out, recluse!’ The Buddha departed, saying: ‘Very well, friend.’ The yakkhathen ordered: ‘Come in, recluse!’ Saying, ‘Yes, friend’, the Buddha entered. Fora second time the yakkha shouted thus to the Buddha: ‘Get out, recluse!’ TheBuddha again departed, saying ‘Very well, friend.’ For a second time the yakkhaordered: ‘Come in, recluse!’ Saying, ‘Yes, friend’, the Buddha again entered.For a third time also the yakkha shouted: ‘Get out, recluse!’ And for a thirdtime the Buddha departed, saying ‘Very well, friend’. However, when Āḷavakashouted his orders to the Buddha yet again the Buddha retorted: ‘I will not obeyyou and you can do whatever you like about it!’ ‘I shall put a question to youthen, recluse, and if you do not answer I will pervert your mind or tear outyour heart or take you by the feet and throw you to the other side of theriver!’ ‘I do not see, friend, in the world of gods, Māras, Brahmas, or menanyone who could do to me such as you say. However, friend, proceed with yourquestion.’1 Āḷavaka: What is the best wealth to a man in this world? What is the goodpractice that brings happiness? What is the sweetest of all tastes? What mannerof living is said to be the noblest kind?(181)2 The Buddha: Confidence is the best wealth to a man in this world. Wellpractised Dhamma brings [the most] happiness. Truth is the sweetest of alltastes. Living with wisdom is said to be the noblest kind.(182)3 Āḷavaka: How does one cross the flood [of recurrent birth]? How does one crossthe sea [of existence]? How does one transcend unhappiness? How does one getpurified?(183)4 The Buddha: One crosses the flood [of cycles of birth and death = Samsāra] byconfidence. One crosses the sea [of existence] by vigilance. One transcendsunhappiness by strenuous effort. One purifies oneself by wisdom.(184)5 Āḷavaka: How does one acquire knowledge? How does one obtain wealth? How doesone attain fame? How does one gain friends? How does one not repent passing fromthis world to the next?(185)6 The Buddha: One acquires knowledge by reposing confidence and listening to theDhamma of the arahants for the attainment of Nibbāna, being diligent andattentive.(186)7 One who does what is proper, one who is resolute, one who is industriousacquires wealth. One attains fame by truth. One who gives gains friends.(187)8 The confident householder in whom there are four virtues — truthfulness,goodness, energy and generosity — will not repent after his death.(188)9 I challenge you to consult other ascetics and brahmins to ascertain whetherthere can be any other qualities higher than truth, self-control, generosity andpatience!(189)10 Āḷavaka: Why should I consult other ascetics and brahmins?

Āmagandha Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_2]Stench [part0006.html#s2_2]The spiritual meaning of ‘impurity’The ascetic Tissa addressed the Buddha Kassapa:1 Millet, cingula beans and peas, edible leaves and roots, the fruit of anycreeper; the virtuous who eat these, obtained justly, do not tell lies out ofsensuous delight.(239)2 O Kassapa, you who eat any food given by others, which is well-prepared,nicely arranged, pure and appealing; he who enjoys such food made with rice,eats [rotting flesh that emits a] stench.(240)3 O brahmin, although you say that the charge of stench does not apply to youwhilst eating rice with well-prepared fowl, yet I inquire the meaning of thisfrom you: of what kind is your stench?(241)4 The Buddha Kassapa: Taking life, beating, wounding, binding, stealing, lying,deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery; this is stench. Not the eating ofmeat.(242)5 In this world those individuals who are unrestrained in sensual pleasures, whoare greedy for sweet things, who are associated with impure actions, who are ofnihilistic views, crooked, difficult to follow; this is stench . . .1[part0008.html#en-2b_1](243)6 In this world those who are rude, arrogant, backbiting, treacherous, unkind,excessively egoistic, miserly, and do not give anything to anybody; this isstench . . .(244)7 Anger, pride, obstinacy, antagonism, deceit, envy, boasting, excessive egoism,association with the immoral; this is stench . . .(245)8 Those who are of bad morals, refuse to pay their debts, slanderous, deceitfulin their dealings, pretentious, those who in this world, being the vilest ofmen, commit such wrong things; this is stench . . .(246)9 Those persons who, in this world, are uncontrolled towards living beings, whoare bent on injuring others, having taken their belongings; immoral, cruel,harsh, disrespectful; this is stench . . .(247)10 Those who attack these living beings either out of greed or of hostility andare always bent upon evil, go to darkness after death, and fall headlong intowoeful states; this is stench . . .(248)11 Abstaining from fish and meat, nakedness, shaving of the head, matted hair,smearing with ashes, wearing rough deerskins, attending the sacrificial fire;none of the various penances in the world performed for unhealthy ends, neitherincantations, oblations, sacrifices nor seasonal observances, purify a personwho has not overcome his doubts.(249)12 He who lives with his senses guarded and conquered and is established in theDhamma, delights in uprightness and gentleness; who has gone beyond attachmentsand has overcome all sorrows; that wise man does not cling to what is seen andheard.(250)13 Thus the Buddha Kassapa preached this again and again. That ascetic who waswell-versed in the [Vedic] hymns understood it. The sage who is free fromdefilements, non-attached and difficult to follow, uttered this [discourse] inbeautiful stanzas.(251)14 Thus, having listened to the well-spoken words of the Buddha who is free fromdefilements, which end all misery, he worshipped the Tathāgata with humble mindand requested to be admitted into the Order at that very place.(252)Note1 [part0008.html#en2b_1] From 5 to 10 each stanza ends with the refrain, ‘Not the eating of meat.’3.

Mahāmaṅgala Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_4]The Auspicious Performance [part0006.html#s2_4]The definition of the highest blessingThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was living near Sāvaṭṭhi in the Jeta Grove atAnāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, one beautiful night, a certain devatā, havingillumined the whole Jeta Grove with surpassing splendour, came to the Buddhaand, making salutations, stood on one side and addressed the Buddha in [thefollowing] verse:1 Many gods and men, wishing for well-being, have pondered over those thingsthat constitute auspicious performances. Tell us what is the highest auspiciousperformance.1 [part0008.html#en-2d_1](258)The Buddha:2 Not to associate with fools, but to associate with the wise and to honourthose who are worthy of honour; this is the most auspicious performance.(259)3 To reside in a congenial environment, to have done meritorious deeds in thepast and to set oneself in the right course; this is the most auspiciousperformance.(260)4 A good, all-round, education, [appreciation of] the Arts, a highly-traineddiscipline and pleasant speech; this is the most auspicious performance.(261)5 Supporting one’s father and mother, cherishing wife and children and apeaceful occupation; this is the most auspicious performance.(262)6 Liberality, dutiful conduct, the helping of relatives and blameless actions;this is the most auspicious performance.(263)7 Ceasing and abstaining from evil, abstention from intoxicating drinks anddiligence in virtue; this is the most auspicious performance.(264)8 Reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude and timely hearing of the Dhamma;this is the most auspicious performance.(265)9 Forbearance, obedience, association with exemplars of the Dhamma-life andparticipation in religious discussions; this is the most auspicious performance.(266)10 Self-control, perception of the Noble Truths and the realization of Nibbāna;this is the most auspicious performance.(267)11 If one’s mind is sorrowless, stainless and secure [in Nibbāna] and is notdisturbed when affected by worldly vicissitudes;2 [part0008.html#en-2d_2] thisis the most auspicious performance.(268)12 Those who thus acting are everywhere unconquered, attain happiness everywhere— to them these are the most auspicious performances.(269)Notes1 [part0008.html#en2d_1] Highest performance, great happiness or blessing.2 [part0008.html#en2d_2] Primarily the following pairs of worldly vicissitudes or conditions areconnected with one’s life: gain and loss, success and defeat, praise and blame,happiness and sorrow.5. Sūciloma Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_5]Sūciloma [part0006.html#s2_5]A discourse similar to the Āḷavaka Sutta (above)Thus have I heard: Once when the Buddha was spending some time at Gayā on astone couch in the abode of the yakkha Sūciloma, the yakkhas Khara and Sūcilomawere passing nearby [and the former asked] ‘Is this man an ascetic?’ Sūcilomareplied: ‘He’s no ascetic but merely feigning his appearance. However, I’ll makesure.’ Then Sūciloma went up to the Buddha and tried to press himself againsthis body but the Buddha drew back from his touch. Thereupon Sūciloma asked theBuddha: ‘O ascetic, are you afraid of me?’ The Buddha replied: ‘Friend, I am notafraid of you, but your touch is unpleasant.’Sūciloma: I shall ask you a question, O ascetic; if you fail to answer it I’lldrive you out of your wits, or tear out your heart, or take you by your feet andfling you to the other side of the Ganges.The Buddha: I do not see, friend, in the world a person who could do so.However, friend, ask any question you like.1 Sūciloma: From where do passion and hate spring? From where do discontentment,attachment and terror spring? From where do evil speculations arise and harassthe mind as do boys a crow?(270)2 The Buddha: Passion and hatred spring from egoism. So do discontentment,attachment and terror. Speculative thoughts also spring therefrom and harass themind as do boys a crow.(271)3 They spring from desire, are in one’s self like the shoots which spring fromthe branches of a banyan tree. They are attached to sense desires like a māluvācreeper which overgrows the jungle.(272)4 Listen, O yakkha, those who know the source, overcome it. They cross the floodwhich is difficult to cross and which has never been crossed before, and are nomore reborn.(273)6. Dhammācariya Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_6]The Good Life [part0006.html#s2_6]The monks are recommended to expel those liable to detract from their leading apure life1 If one renounces household life, becomes a recluse and leads a pure andcelibate life; this is the worthiest1 [part0008.html#en-2f_1] jewel.(274)2 However, if he be, by nature, garrulous, and brutishly derives pleasure frominjuring others, the life of such a one becomes unprofitable and his defilementsincrease.(275)3 A monk who delights in quarrelling, being veiled by delusion, does notunderstand the doctrine preached by the Buddha even when explained.(276)4 Led by ignorance, he does not understand that injuring those whose minds arewell composed, is misconduct that leads to a woeful state.(277)5 That kind of monk, certainly, will experience misery after death, going toplaces of suffering from birth to birth, from darkness to [greater] darkness.(278)6 Like a cess-pool filled over a number of years, such an impure one isdifficult to be purified.(279)7 O monks, if you should know such a one who is attached to the worldly life,having unwholesome desires, ulterior motives, and of evil modes of behaviour.(280)8 Ostracise and oust him, all being united; as dust, sweep him out, as refuse,remove him.(281)9 Then remove those hollow ones who, not being monks, yet pretend to be so;eject those possessing the aforementioned undesirable traits of character.(282)10 Be pure and associate with the pure; being mindful, united and arise; put anend to suffering.(283)Note1 [part0008.html#en2f_1] I think vasu means wealth. The commentary also says vasuttaman ti uttamaratanaṃ.7. Brāhmaṇadhammika Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_7]The Good Conduct of the Brahmin [part0006.html#s2_7]The Buddha describes the ideal mode of life of brahmins in the ‘Golden Age’ andhow they degeneratedThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was living near Sāvaṭṭhi in the Jeta Grove atAnāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a great many wealthy brahmins of Kosala,decrepit, elderly, old, advanced in years, arrived at old age, went to where theBuddha was residing and were highly pleased with seeing him. Having exchangedfriendly speech causing delight and worthy of being remembered, They sat down onone side and asked the Buddha: ‘Venerable Gotama, are the brahmins of thepresent day found engaged in the priestly duties of the ancient brahmins?’‘The brahmins of the present day are not, indeed, found engaged in the priestlyduties of the ancient brahmins’.‘It will be good of you, Gotama, if you will explain them, if it is notinconvenient to you.’The Buddha:1 The sages of ancient times, possessed of self-control and restrained mind,abandoning the fivefold sensual pleasures, led a life for their own welfare.(284)2 The brahmins of ancient times had no cattle, neither gold nor corn. Learningwas wealth and corn for them; they protected this divine treasure.(285)3 Whatever food prepared for them was placed at the door — they considered thatit was prepared through devotion to those seekers.(286)4 Prosperous people from the provinces and outside countries worshipped thosebrahmins with garments of various colours, beds and dwellings.(287)5 The brahmins were neither injured nor conquered. They were protected byvirtue. No one ever opposed them at the entrance of any household.(288)6 Formerly the brahmins practised celibacy from their youth up to theirforty-eighth year. They were engaged in search of learning and good conduct.(289)7 The brahmins cohabited not with another’s wife nor did they buy a wife. Beingbrought by mutual love to love together, they were pleased with each other.(290)8 The brahmins cohabited not except with a wife whose menstrual discharge hadceased and at no other time but the right time.(291)9 They praised chastity, morality, integrity, amiability, penance, gentleness,non-violence and forbearance.(292)10 If there was any brahmin of great influence, who was the noblest of them,even he was chaste and did not even in dreams indulge in sexual intercourse.(293)11 Here, some wise men, following his precepts, praised chastity, morality andforbearance.(294)12 Having begged for rice, beds, cloth, butter, oil and collecting them by fairmeans, they offered such objects as these for sacrifice, and at the sacrificethey did not kill cows.(295)13 The cows by means of which medicinal drugs are produced are our greatfriends, like our mother, father, brother and other relations.(296)14 They give food, strength, beauty, health — knowing these benefits, they didnot kill cattle.(297)15 The brahmins were graceful, large-bodied, handsome and honoured, veryattentive to their duties and zealous as to what should be done and what shouldnot be done. This community thus prospered happily in the world as long as theylived accordingly.(298)16 Having seen worthless things such as wealth and well-adorned women, however,there was a change in them.(299)17–18 The brahmins coveted the great enjoyments of men surrounded by herds ofcows, groups of beautiful women, chariots with weil-trained horses, welldecorated with beautifui curtains and homes and dwelling places built to goodproportion.(300–1)19 Composing hymns, they then approached the king, Okkāka, and said: ‘You arepossessed of manifold wealth; offer us your vast riches; offer us your immensewealth.’(302)20 Then the king, the lord of chariots, persuaded by the brahmins, performedfreely the horse sacrifice, the human sacrifice, the water rites and thesacrifice of liquor. Having performed these sacrifices, he gave wealth to thebrahmins.(303)21 Cattle, beds, garments, adorned women, well-made chariots drawn by noblehorses and covers of various embroidery.(304)22 Beautiful houses, well planned into apartments, filling these with variouskinds of grain — thus gave this wealth to the brahmins.(305)23 And they having thus received wealth desired to hoard; and being overwhelmedby covetousness their greed increased. They composed hymns and again approachedOkkāka.(306)24 ‘Like water, earth, gold and corn — even so are the cattle, for they are thenecessary appendage of living beings. Therefore, offer us your immense wealth,give us your vast riches.’(307)25 Then the king, the lord of chariots, persuaded by the brahmins caused to bekilled many hundred thousand cattle in sacrifice.(308)26 Neither with their legs nor with their horns do the cows hurt anybody, beingobedient like lambs and yielding jars of milk. The king, seizing them by thehorns, had them killed by a sword.(309)27 Then the gods, the ancestors, Indra, the titans and the demons cried out asthe sword fell on the cows: ‘This is unjust!’(310)28 In ancient days there were only three diseases: desire, hunger and decay; butowing to the killing of animals, these sprang to ninety-eight.(311)29 This old injustice has come down. The innocent cows are killed. Thesacrificing priests have fallen from virtue.(312)30 Thus this ancient, mean practice is censured by the wise. Wherever such apractice is seen people blame the sacrificing priest.(313)31 Thus, dutiful conduct being destroyed, the workmen and traders were divided,the warriors were also widely separated. The wife disregarded her husband.(314)32 The warriors, brahmins and others who protected their castes, disregardingtheir caste, came under the influence of sensual pleasure.(315)It being thus spoken, the brahmins of great wealth said thus to the Buddha: ‘Itis amazing, Venerable Gotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if onemight raise what has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or pointout the way to him who has gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so thatthose who have eyes may see objects, so likewise has the Truth been explained byVenerable Gotama in various ways. Therefore, we take refuge in him, his Dhammaand his Sangha. May the Venerable Gotama accept us as lay followers whohenceforth have taken refuge in him for the rest of our lives.’8.

The learned person thus being venerated, being pleased with thedisciple, makes the Dhamma manifest.(316)2 Having paid attention to it and considered it, the wise man, putting theDhamma into practice, becomes learned, intelligent and accomplished and, beingvigilant, he associates with such a teacher.(317)3 One who follows an inferior and foolish teacher who has not realized themeaning, and who is jealous, approaches death without comprehending the Dhammaand unrelieved of doubt.(318)4 As a man who has fallen into an overflowing river with deep water and a rapidcurrent; carried away by a swift-flowing current, how can he help others tocross it?(319)5 Even so, he who has not comprehended the Dhamma, has not paid attention to itsmeaning as expounded by the learned, being himself without knowledge — how canhe make others understand?(320)6 As one who, having boarded a boat firmly equipped with oars and a rudder, andknowing the method, is skilful and wise, by means of it he causes many others tocross over.(321)7 Even so, he who has attained knowledge and has a well-trained mind, who islearned and unmoved; clearly knows he can help others to understand, who areattentive to listen and ready to comprehend.(322)8 Therefore, one should surely associate with a good man who is wise andlearned. He should know the meaning and practise accordingly and, gainingunderstanding of the Dhamma, will attain happiness.(323)Note1 [part0008.html#en2h_1] Boat or ship; Sutta-Nipāta Commentary: Dhamma, thus it is also called DhammaSuita.9.

Let him remember and practise the teaching, self-restraintand virtue.(326)4 One who rejoices and delights in the Dhamma and who is well-established in it;one who does not speak in opposition to the Dhamma; one who refrains fromunprofitable conversation, let him pass his time with true and well-spokenwords.(327)5 Having abandoned laughter, gossip, complaining, ill-will, deception,hypocrisy, greediness, spite, bad temper, impurity and attachment, let him livefree from pride, with steady mind.(328)6 The essence of well-spoken words is understanding. The essence of learning andunderstanding is concentration. The wisdom and learning of the man who is hastyand negligent do not increase.(329)7 Those who delight in the teaching taught by the Noble Ones are unique inspeech, mind and action; are established in peace, gentleness and meditation,and obtain the essence of learning and wisdom.(330)10.

The Saddhammopāyana,ed. R. Morris, Journal of the Pali Text Society, VI, London 1887 (repr. 1978),enumerates only 8 inopportune moments (see vv. 4 – 6).

Rāhula Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_11]Rāhula [part0006.html#s2_11]The Buddha recommends the life of a recluse to his son, RāhulaThe Buddha:1 Do you not despise the wise man by constantly living with him? Is the holderof the torch to mankind honoured by you?(335)Rāhula:2 I do not despise the wise man by constantly living with him. The holder of thetorch to mankind is always honoured by me.(336)The Buddha:3 Discarding the five pleasures of sense, enticing and delightful to the mind,renouncing the home through confidence, be one who puts an end to suffering.(337)4 Associate with good friends; resort to a remote dwelling place, which issecluded and quiet. Be moderate in eating.(338)5 Do not crave for these things; robes, food, medicines and dwelling. Do not beone who returns to the world.(339)6 Have restraint according to the disciplinary code. Be restrained in the fivesenses. Be mindful of the body and continually develop dispassion.(340)7 Avoid lustful signs which are connected with passion. Cultivate your mindwhich is concentrated and undisturbed on the impurities of the body.(341)8 Meditate on the Signless [Nibbāna]. Forsake the tendency of egoism. Therebyending such egoism you will live calmly.(342)Thus the Buddha constantly advised Venerable Rāhula by these stanzas.12. Vaṅgīsa Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_12]1 [part0008.html#en-2z_1]Vaṅgīsa [part0006.html#s2_12]Vaṅgīsa receives confirmation that his teacher has attained NibbānaOnce the Buddha resided near Āḷavi at a shrine called Aggāḷava. At that time theVenerable Nigrodhakappa, the preceptor of Venerable Vaṅgīsa, had passed awaythere not long before. Then a thought occurred to the Venerable Vaṅgīsa (wholived in solitude) during his private meditations as to whether his preceptorhad attained Nibbāna or not. Then, rising from his retirement in the evening,Venerable Vaṅgīsa [accompanied by his colleagues] approached the Buddha and withdue respect he questioned thus:1 We ask the Buddha of great wisdom, the remover of doubts in this world — thewell-known monk, possessor of glory and peaceful mind, who died at Aggāḷava.(343)2 O Buddha, the name Nigrodhakappa was given to him by you. Being strenuous, hewandered about venerating you, aspiring to liberation, firm in the perception ofthe Dhamma.(344)3 O Buddha, the All-seeing One, we all wish to know about that disciple. We areready to hear, you are our Master, you are incomparable.(345)4 Cut off our doubt, tell us about this. O you of extensive wisdom, make knownto us whether he has attained Nibbāna. O you, All-seeing One, speak in the midstof us as the thousand-eyed Indra, the king of gods.(346)5 Whatever knots there are in the world, leading to delusion, associated withignorance, causing doubt, all these are untied when one comes to the Tathāgata:indeed his eye is the greatest for all men.(347)6 If a man such as you, did not dispel passions as wind dispels the clouds, thewhole world would be covered with darkness; not even illustrious men wouldshine.(348)7 Wise men are the enlighteners. For certain I think you are a wise one. We havecome to you, endowed with insight and knowledge. Will you reveal the position ofVenerable Nigrodhakappa to us in the midst of this assembly?(349)8 O lovely one, quickly raise your sweet voice as a swan stretching forth itsneck with a rich and well-regulated voice. We will all listen to youattentively.(350)9 We earnestly request you, the pure one who has overcome birth and deathcompletely, to proclaim the Dhamma, for this is not a mere fulfilment of thedesire of those who are worldlings. Let the Tathāgata act with wisdom.(351)10 The explanations from you who are endowed with guileless wisdom have alwaysbeen accepted. This final folding of hands is well raised. O supreme sage, donot keep us in ignorance.(352)11 Knowing thoroughly the teaching of the noble ones, O you who are of untiringenergy, do not leave us in ignorance. As one suffering from heat in the hotseason longs for water, we long for your words, so please shower your words ofwisdom.(353)12 If Venerable Nigrodhakappa led a holy life, was this fruitful? Did he attainNibbāna with residue left behind? How was he liberated, that we long to hear.(354)13 The Buddha: He cut off the desire for mind and matter in this world which wasMāra’s stream flowing for a long time; he has crossed completely all births anddeaths. Thus said the Blessed One, the chief of the first five disciplines.2[part0008.html#en-2z_2](355)14 You are the noblest of the great sages. Hearing your words I am pleased. Myinquiry has not been in vain. The Buddha did not delude me.(356)15 The Buddha’s disciple was one who acted as you said. He has cut asunder theoutspread and strong net of deceitful Māra.(357)16 O Blessed One, the Venerable Nigrodhakappa saw the source of grasping andcertainly crossed the realm of death so difficult to cross.(358)Notes1 [part0008.html#en2z_1] Also called the Nigrodhakappa Sutta.2 [part0008.html#en2z_2] Paṅcaseṭṭho: in another sense, this implies that the Buddha overpowered the fivesenses.13. Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_13]The Correct Homeless Life [part0006.html#s2_13]Questioner:1 I ask the sage of great wisdom who has crossed [the flood of existence] andgone over to the other shore, who has attained Nibbāna and is steadfast: Howshould a monk properly lead a homeless life after going forth from the householdlife and having repelled the sense desires?(359)The Buddha:2 In him whom belief in the efficacy of omens like shooting stars, dreams andsigns is destroyed; that monk who has avoided the resulting consquences wouldproperly lead a homeless life.(360)3 Let the monk give up the desire for sense pleasure, either earthly or heavenlyand passing beyond existence and understanding the Teaching, he would . . .1[part0008.html#en-2m_1](361)4 Let the monk refrain from slander and give up anger and greed and be free fromattraction and repulsion.

Dhammika Sutta [part0006.html#sec2_14]Dhammika [part0006.html#s2_14]Synopses of the monk and lay livesThus have I heard: Once when the Buddha was dwelling near Sāvatthi in the JetaGrove at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the lay disciple, Dhammika, accompanied byfive hundred colleagues, visited him. After paying their respects they tooktheir seats and Dhammika addressed the Buddha:1 O Gotama of great wisdom, I ask you: Acting in what manner does a disciple whogoes from home to a homeless life, or one who is still a good lay devotee, actwell?(376)2 For you know the course of the world including that of the gods and also theway beyond [Nibbāna]. There are none comparable with you who see the subtlemeanings of things. They say that you are, indeed, the most excellent andEnglightened One.(377)3 Realizing all wisdom and being merciful to all sentient beings you expoundedthe Dhamma. You are the destroyer of the veil of ignorance. You are thepossessor of eyes on every aspect. Stainless, you illumine the whole world.(378)4 The king of elephants, Erāvaṇa, hearing you were the Conqueror, came near toyou. After listening, he made an utterance of delight and went away, saying‘Excellent’.(379)5 The king, Vessavaṇa Kuvera, called upon you to [ask a] question on the Dhamma.When you were so questioned by him, O Wise One, you spoke to him and he, also,after listening, was delighted.(380)6 None of those disputing heretics, whether fallacious reasoners (Ājīvikas) orbondless ascetics (Nigaṇṭhas) can overcome you by wisdom, as one who isstationary cannot overtake the one who walks swiftly.(381)7 Those disputing brahmins, whosoever they may be, who are experienced, andothers considered to be disputants, all of them expect some explanation fromyou.(382)8 Indeed, this Dhamma, subtle and pleasant, which has been well preached by you,O Blessed One, we all are longing to hear. O noble Buddha, will you speak to uswhen you are requested?(383)9 Let all these monks as well as lay disciples sitting down together hear theDhamma realized by the Stainless One, as gods hear the well-spoken words ofIndra.(384)The Buddha:10 O monks, listen to me, I shall make you hear the pure Dhamma. Will you bearit in mind! Let the wise man who is intent upon his own progress practise theway of deportment suitable for a renounced one.(385)11 The monk should not be wandering at the wrong time but should go to thevillage for alms at the right time. Temptations cling to him who wanders at animproper time. Therefore, the wise ones do not wander at the wrong time.(386)12 Forms, sounds, tastes, odours and contacts completely intoxicate people;putting away the desire for these things he should go at the right time for themorning meal.(387)13 The monk having thus obtained his meal and returned alone, should sit insolitude; reflecting within himself, he should be self-composed, avoidingdistractions.(388)14 If he speaks with a follower or with anybody else or with a fellow-monk, heshould speak of the excellent Dhamma. He should not slander nor speak ill ofothers.(389)15 Some put forward controversial arguments. We do not praise the people oflower understanding. Temptations from here and there ensnare them, for theirminds become deeply involved in them.(390)16 The follower of the noblest Wise One, on hearing the doctrine taught by him,should make use of food, lodging, bed, seat, water, and clean his robe with duecare.(391)17 Therefore, in being detached from these things, the monk must be as a drop ofwater on a lotus leaf.(392)18 Now I will tell you of the rules of conduct for a householder, actingaccording to which, he becomes a good disciple. If there be monk-duty to beperformed, such duty cannot be fulfilled by him who possesses householdproperty.(393)19 Let him not destroy life nor cause others to destroy life and, also, notapprove of others’ killing. Let him refrain from oppressing all living beings inthe world, whether strong or weak.(394)20 Then because the disciple knows that it belongs to others, stealing anythingfrom any place should be avoided. Let him not cause to steal, nor approve ofothers’ stealing. All stealing should be avoided.(395)21 The wise man should avoid non-celibate life as if it were a burning charcoalpit. If he is unable to lead a celibate life fully, let him not transgress withanother’s wife.(396)22 Whether he is in an assembly or in a public place let him not tell lies toanother. Let him not cause others to tell lies nor approve of others’ tellinglies.(397)23 The householder who delights in self-control, knowing that taking intoxicantsresults in its loss, should not indulge in taking intoxicants nor should hecause others to take them nor approve of others’ doing so.(398)24 Fools commit evil deeds as a result of drunkenness and cause other people,who are negligent, to act accordingly. One should avoid this sphere of evildeeds, this madness, this delusion, this delight of fools.(399)25 (i) One should not destroy life; (ii) should not take that which is notgiven; (iii) should not tell lies; (iv) should not be a drinker; (v) shouldrefrain from all unchastity; (vi) should not eat untimely food at night.(400)26 (vii) One should not wear ornaments nor use perfumes; (viii) should lie on amat spread on the ground. This they call an eightfold sacred observanceproclaimed by the Buddha who came to do away with sorrow.(401)27 Being happy-minded one should observe this virtue of eight precepts on thefourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the lunar fortnight [and during thePāṭihāriyapakkha — the three rainy months together with those preceding andfollowing this season, five months in all].(402)28 Then on the following morning, the wise one who has observed eight preceptsshould happily provide the Community of Monks with food and drink in a suitablemanner.(403)29 Let him support his father and mother in a proper manner and also pursue ablameless career. The householder observing these duties with diligence isreborn in the sphere of ‘self-luminant’ beings.(404)"},{"pageContent":"III. The Great Chapter [part0003.html#c3]1. Pabbajjā Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_1]The Going Forth [part0006.html#s3_1]of the Buddha and his encounter with King Bimbisāra1 I shall tell you about the renunciation, the manner in which the one withinsight renounced the world and the manner of his inquiry which led him tochoose the life of renunciation.(405)2 ‘In a home’, thought that man, ‘a life is stifled — impurity is everywherelike dust.’ ‘For the wanderer’, thought that man, ‘there is space — he lives outin the open, in the air.’ He saw this was so and set off.(406)3 He was now a wanderer. So he worked to purify his life: in everything he didand in everything he said he avoided the unwholesome and the bad.(407)4 And as he, the Buddha, the one full of noble characteristics, walked about insearch of food he came in time to Rājagaha, in Magadha.(408)5 The king, Bimbisāra, stood in his palace and, seeing the one possessing thenoble characteristics, called out to his followers:(409)6–7 ‘Look carefully, friends, he is handsome, shapely and of beautifulcomplexion. His gait is pleasing with his eyes cast at only a little distance;with downcast eyes he is mindful and he does not seem to be from a low family.Send out the palace messengers to find out where he’s going.’ (410–11)8 So the king’s men were sent out and they followed him inquiring, ‘Where is themonk going? Where is he planning to stay?’(412)9 The beggar walked on from house to house watching the sense doors, wellrestrained, alert and mindful. Soon his bowl was full.(413)10 When his begging-round was over he set off [for the hills] and made his waytowards mount Paņḍava. The messengers now knew that he would stay there.(414)11 Seeing that he was going to stay there, some sat down and watched whileanother messenger went back to inform the king.(415)12 ‘Your Majesty’, he said, ‘the monk has settled down on the east side of mountPaṇḍava. He’s sitting there in his mountain lair like a lion or a tiger or abull!’(416)13 Hearing the messenger’s words the warrior king had his special chariotprepared and then set off with the greatest haste to mount Paṇḍava.(417)14 The king went as far as he could go by the chariot and then got off andwalked up the mountain to the monk.(418)15 He sat down beside him, exchanged greetings and respects, and then spokethus:(419)16 ‘You are only a young man, sir, a lad in the prime of your life. You arehandsome and shapely. You appear to be a prince of noble birth.(420)17 Adorning a splendid army, esteemed by a council of nobles, enjoy wealth whichI can bestow upon you. However, can you please tell me what family you’re from?’(421)18 ‘King’, came the answer, ‘not far from Himavant, the snowland, is a countrycalled Kosala. The people of Kosala are rich and they are strong.(422)19 They come from the race of the sun and their family name is Sākya. That wasthe people I left when I walked away from the wish and the longing for pleasure.(423)20 I have seen the miseries of pleasure. I have seen the security involved inrenouncing them;So now I will go,I will go on into the struggle,This is to my mind delight;This is where my mind finds bliss.’(424)2. Padhāna Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_2]The Striving [part0006.html#s3_2]of the Buddha against temptation1 I was living on the bank of the Neraimage [../images/00004.jpeg]jara riverengaged in deep struggle, practising meditation with all my strength in theeffort to find freedom from bondage.(425)2 Māra came up to me and started talking to me in words appearing to be full ofsympathy: ‘You’re so thin and pale’, he said, ‘Why — you’re near to death!(426)3 I’ll bet a thousand to one you’re going to die — there’s only the slightestchance that you’ll survive! My dear sir, do live! It’s far better to live — youcould accumulate merit if you stayed alive.(427)4 You could lead the religious life, perform the offerings to the fire (god) —it’s a sure way to get lots of merit. What’s the point of all this exertion?(428)5 The path of exertion and struggle is difficult, hard and strenuous, and fullof troubles.’ Uttering these verses, Māra stood right next to the Buddha.(429)6 Then the Buddha told Māra who was uttering such words: ‘Why have you comehere, evil one, you friend of negligence?(430)7 I do not need the least merit you speak of. O Māra, you should preach aboutmerits to those who need them.(431)8 I have confidence and energy and knowledge as well. So have I engaged myselfin effort. Why do you inquire about my life?(432)9 When the wind blows, even rivers and streams are dried up. So why shouldn’t itdry up my blood while I am deep in struggle?(433)10 As the blood dries up, so too will bile and phlegm. The body may be wastingaway, but the mind gets more and more settled. More and more do mindfulness,wisdom and concentration get established in me.(434)11 While living in this manner experiencing the extremes of sensation my mind nolonger aspires for sensuous pleasures.(435)12 The foremost of your armies is that of Desire, the second is called Dislike.The third is Hunger-Thirst and the fourth is Craving.(436)13 The fifth is the army of Lethargy-Laziness and the sixth is Fear. The seventhis Doubt and the eighth is Obstinacy-Restlessness.(437)14 Then there are also material gain, praise, honour and fame obtained bywrongful means. One may also think highly of oneself and disparage others.(438)15 These, O Māra, are your forces, the attackers of the evil one. One less thana hero will not be victorious over them and attain happiness.(439)16 Look: do you see this strand of muimages [../images/00004.jpeg]ja grass I amwearing? I do not care for life. I would rather die in this conflict than bealive but defeated.(440)17 There are monks and hermits who have drowned [in defilements] and never seethat path which the well-conducted ones tread.(441)18 I can see the troops all around me, with Māra mounted on an elephant, and Igo forward into the struggle.(442)19 Even though the whole world, inclusive of its gods, cannot beat that army ofyours, I am going to destroy it with the power of wisdom like an unfired claypot with a stone.(443)20 With disciplined thought and firmly grounded mindfulness I shall travel fromcountry to country training numerous disciples.(444)21 Alert and energetic in the practice of my teaching, contrary to your wish,they will attain that which having attained they will not come to grief.’(445)22 I’ve followed the Blessed One for seven years’, said Māra, ‘and I’ve watchedevery step he’s made. And not once have I had access to him, who’s completelyenlightened and mindful.(446)23 I remember once seeing a crow hovering above a lump of fat on the groundbelow. “Ah, food!” it thought. But the lump turned out to be a rock, hard andinedible, and the crow flew away disgusted.(447)24 We’ve had enough; it’s like that crow eating rock for us; we’re going away,we’re finished with Gotama!’(448)25 Māra was so upset by his failure that he dropped the lute he was carrying,and at the moment it fell to the ground the evil-minded yakkha disappeared.(449)3. Subhāsita Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_3]Good Words [part0006.html#s3_3]Thus have I heard: Once, when the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove, nearSāvaṭṭhi, he said to his monks:‘Speech which has four characteristics is speech well spoken, blameless and notcensured by the wise; namely, the speech of a monk who speaks only what iswholesome and not what is unwholesome, who speaks only what is worthy and notwhat is unworthy, who speaks only what is pleasant and not what is unpleasant,who speaks only what is truthful and not what is untruthful. Speechcharacterized by these four factors is well spoken, and not ill spoken,blameless and not censured by the wise.’ That is what the Master said, andhaving said this he went on, as Teacher, to say this:1 ‘Wholesome speech, the saints say is the foremost.One should speak what is worthy and not what is unworthy and this is the second.One should speak what is pleasant and not what is unpleasant and this is thethird.One should speak what is truthful and not what is false and this is the fourth.’(450)Then a monk called Vangīsa got up from his seat and went up to the Buddha. Herespectfully placed his robe over one shoulder and with his hands placedtogether asked the Master for permission to speak. Having obtained it, he spokethese appropriate words of praise:2 ‘Let us use words that do not cause us pain.Let us use words that do not hurt each other:Those, truly, are wholesome words.(451)3 Let us use pleasant speech, where the words make people glad, Not resorting toevil speech, let us use pleasant speech on others.(452)4 The words of truth are immortal. This is an eternal nature. As the old sayinggoes, words of truth cannot die. And good people, they say, are well grounded intruth, welfare and virtue.(453)5 And the words which the Buddha speaks, words that lead to blowing out, puttingan end to suffering, are the worthiest words.’(454)4.

Nearby, a brahmin called Sundarika-Bhāradvāja was busyperforming sacred rituals and burning offerings on a fire. When the brahmin hadfinished his rituals, he got up from his seat and looked around. ‘Who shall Igive the remains of my offerings to?’ he asked. Then, not far away, he noticedthe Buddha sitting under a tree, completely covered by his robe. So, with theofferings in one hand and the water jar in the other, the brahmin walked over tothe Buddha. As he heard the brahmin’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head.‘Why’, thought the brahmin, ‘this man’s had his head shaved, he’s nothing but ashaveling!’, and he thought of turning back. But then he thought, ‘Some of thebrahmins have also shaved their heads. I had better go and ask him what familyhe’s from.’ So he went up to the Buddha and said, ‘What caste are you?’ And theBuddha made his answer to the brahmin:1 ‘I am not a brahmin. Nor am I a prince, or a farmer, or anything else. I havecome to understand clearly how worldly people are born; now I wander through theworld as a wise man, without possessions, with nothing.(455)2 I wear a double robe, I have shaved off my hair. And I wander, without a home,without the need to mix with people in this world; fully calmed. Your questionabout caste is irrelevant.’(456)3 ‘But, Sir’, said the brahmin, ‘When brahmins meet they always ask one anotherwhether or not they are brahmins.’The Buddha: ‘If you can say that you are a brahmin and that I am not, then Imust remind you of Sāvitrí’s mantra of three lines and twenty-four letters’.2[part0009.html#en-3a_2](457)4 The brahmin: ‘But why have wise men of all kinds, whether religious, militaryor secular, always made so many offerings to the gods here in this world?’The Buddha: ‘If the person who receives the offering is at the moment ofoffering perfect in understanding, fulfilled and accomplished, then, I wouldsay, the offering will be successful.’(458)5 ‘This offering will certainly be successful, then’, said the brahmin, ‘forhere in front of me is just such a man, a man perfect in understanding. If Ihadn’t seen you or someone like you, then I would have given the cake to someother person’.(459)6 The Buddha: ‘Since you are searching for something, brahmin, come here and askabout it. Perhaps you might find here an understanding that is clear, withoutanger or pain, or desire; one that is calm.’(460)7 The brahmin: ‘O Gotama, I very much like making offerings and I am anxious tomake more. But I do not understand them. Can you teach me, and tell me whatmakes an offering effective?’The Buddha: ‘Listen carefully then, brahmin, and I will teach you about it.(461)8 Do not ask about caste, but ask about conduct. Look at the flames of a fire.Where do they come from? From a piece of wood. In the same way a wise man maycome from a low caste; through his firmness and moral restraint he becomesnoble.(462)9 This sense of truth quietens him, he learns self-control and, living a life ofgood conduct, he comes to complete understanding. This is where offerings shouldbe given when offerings are due; this is where the brahmin, the man intent onpositive action, gives offerings.(463)10 There are wanderers who have given up homes and let sense pleasures go, whoare practised in restraint and whose movement is as straight as a shuttle. Thisis where . . .3 [part0009.html#en-3a_3](464)11 Those are those who are free from passion and with well composed faculties,who like the moon that has got free from the grip of Rāhu. This is where ...(465)12 There is no clinging to anything for these world-wanderers. They are alwaysmindful and self-thoughts have been left behind. This is where . . .(466)13 The wandering conqueror — who has let sense pleasures go — has seen wherebirth and death end. In the fullness of extinguishing he is cool like a lake: heis the One-Thus-Come [Tathāgata] and worthy of offerings.(467)14 On a par with his equals, the even-minded, and beyond comparison with theuneven, the One-Thus-Come has limitless understanding. Nothing in this world oranywhere can pollute him: the One-Thus-Come is worthy of offerings.(468)15 Pride and deceit do not exist; there is no trace of ignorance, ofself-thoughts, of desire. Anger has been lost, and in the utter calm of fullextinguishing the brahmin has removed the taint of grief. The One-Thus-Come isworthy of offerings.(469)16 Resting places for the mind have gone. Grasping is no longer there at all.Clinging to nothing in this world or anywhere, the One-Thus-Come is worthy ofofferings.(470)17 He has crossed the stream, the mind is composed. In the perfection ofknowledge he has realized the way things are. He is in his last body, and thepassions are burnt out. The One-Thus-Come is worthy of offerings.(471)18 The intoxication of being has been destroyed and eliminated, and so has abuseof speech; there is none of it. Liberated and fulfilled in every respect, theOne-Thus-Come is worthy of offerings.(472)19 He has shaken off ties, he is not tied down in any way, and there is neverany pride, even when he is amongst proud people. He has come to understand wheresuffering begins and how far it goes. The One-Thus-Come is worthy of offerings.(473)20 He seeks seclusion, not accepting desires and untouched by opinions. Noobjects of sense are clung to, none whatsoever: the One-Thus-Come is worthy ofofferings.(474)21 All ties of every description, thoroughly examined, are destroyed andeliminated; they have all gone. Calm in the freedom of extinguished attachmenthe is the One-Thus-Come and worthy of offerings.(475)22 He sees the end of birth, the end of habit-chains. He has left completely thepath of passion: pure, faultless, spotless, flawless, he is the One-Thus-Comeand worthy of offerings.(476)23 He does not see himself in terms of the self; poised, upright, firm, and freefrom desire, harshness and doubt, he is the One-Thus-Come and worthy ofofferings.(477)24 There is nothing in him that can lead to bewilderment; causes of ignoranceare gone, there are none whatsoever. He perceives with insight all phenomena. Hebears the last body. Full enlightenment is reached, ultimate and blissful, andpurification of the person takes place. This is the One-Thus-Come and is worthyof offerings.’(478)25 The brahmin: ‘I have met a being who is complete in understanding; may myoffering therefore be true! With Brahmā as my witness I ask the Buddha to acceptme; may the Buddha enjoy these offerings?’(479)26 The Buddha: ‘Now, brahmin, I do not accept gifts earned by chanting texts;this is not the way with people of clear knowledge. Enlightened beings rejectwhat is earned by chanting texts, and while Truth exists this will always be thepractice of Buddhas.(480)27 You may attend upon a great sage who is perfect, who is passion-free and whohas calmed anxiety with some other food and drink. That will be a field for theman intent on merit.’(481)28 The brahmin: ‘Very good, my Lord. But I should like to know to whom peoplelike me should offer gifts. Tell me, in the light of your teaching, whom Ishould look for when I am making sacrifices?’(482)29–30The Buddha:‘Where there is no quarrel,Where the mind is undisturbed,Where there is freedom from lust,Where lethargy is done away with,Where passions are conquered,Where birth and death are understood —Here is the man of wisdom, the muni,When a person like this is present at an offering.(483–4)31 You should welcome him and honour him with food and drink, without any traceof a frown. This is how a gift will be effective.’(485)32 The brahmin: ‘Buddha, you are worthy of a gift, unsurpassable field of merit,and a recipient of sacrifice! What is given to your reverence is of immensefruit.’(486)Then Sundarika-Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha: ‘It is amazing, Venerable Gotama,it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if one might raise what has beenoverturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the way to him who hasgone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so that those who have eyes may seeobjects, so likewise has the Truth been explained by Venerable Gotama in variousways. Therefore, I take refuge in him, his Dhamma and his Sangha. I wish toenter the homeless life and to receive the higher ordination near the ‘VenerableGotama.’Then Sundarika-Bhāradvāja received ordination as a novice and received thehigher ordination near the Buddha.Later, by leading a secluded life, diligently, energetically and with a resolutewill, in a short time he understood, experienced and attained that highestperfection of a noble life for which the sons of good families leave thehousehold life, harmoniously, and take to the life of homelessness. Rebirth hadbeen ended: a noble life had been led: what was to be done had been done andthere was nothing else to be done in this earthly existence:Sundarika-Bhāradvāja had become one of the arahants.Notes1 [part0009.html#en3a_1] Pūraḷāsa (Skt.

Māgha Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_5]Māgha [part0006.html#s3_5](Similar to the preceding Sutta)Thus have I heard: Once the Buddha was staying on Mount Vulture’s Peak, nearRājagaha.One day a young man, a brahmin called Māgha, came to see the Master. Theygreeted each other in the usual way and the young man sat down by the side ofthe Buddha.‘Gotama, sir’, he said, ‘I am a lay sponsor. I make donations, give financialsupport, presents, gifts, and such like. I am an approachable person and quiteopen to requests. The wealth I give away, I have made quite lawfully, and Idistribute these lawful profits to one or two people, or sometimes to twenty orthirty people, or sometimes to a hundred or more. What I would like to know,sir, is whether it’s worthwhile making all these gifts and offerings. Could youtell me if they produce merit for me?’‘Young man’, said the Master, ‘all these gifts and offerings you make arecertainly worthwhile and they do produce great merit. It is the same for any manwho makes donations and gives support, who stays approachable and open torequests, and who shares his lawful profits amongst one or two, or twenty orthirty, or a hundred people, or more. All these gifts will bring great merit tohim.’Then the young brahmin asked another question, and this time he spoke in verse:1 ‘Gotama, sir’, he said, ‘you are a yellow-robed wanderer, a man without ahome; you are a man who knows meaningful speech. Could you please answer thisquestion for me: If a layman who is a charitable person, one from whom a giftmay be expected makes an offering, desiring merit by giving food and drink toothers, then offering to whom will his offering be pure?’(487)2 ‘If this charitable layman’, said the Master, ‘is going to make an offering,or donate food and drink, and if he needs and wants to make merit, then to makethe offering successful he must give it to someone who can receive a sacrifice.He must give it to someone who is giftworthy.’(488)3 Then the brahmin asked the Buddha to tell him who these people were who couldreceive a sacrifice from charitable and well-intentioned laymen. ‘Which people’,asked the brahmin, ‘are giftworthy?’(489)4 And the Master replied:‘There are people who wander around in this world, without attachments,possessions, with nothing. They are whole and complete and they have control ofthe self.When the time comes for giving, these are the people to give to. These are thepeople whom the well-intentioned brahmin should give to.1[part0009.html#en-3b_1](490)5 Those who have cut off the fetters and bonds, who are tamed, free, passionlessand desireless.(491)6 Those who are freed from all fetters, have tamed the wild and become free,free from the rage of passion and from desire.(492)7 Getting rid of lust, hatred and delusion, they have eradicated the defilementsand have perfected the religious life.(493)8 There are people with no room for trickery or pride. They have no greed, nothoughts of ‘I’, no desire.(494)9 They have gone across the ocean, for they did not fall prey to the thirst ofcraving. And so now they can live and move around without thoughts of ‘I’.(495)10 They do not have longings or yearnings for anything in the world. They haveno longing to be something in this world and no longing to be in any otherworld.(496)11 They have given up pleasure that is sense-based and they have perfect andfine self-control. They walk from one place to another without homes to returnto and they move with directness, like a shuttle [pulling thread through aloom].(497)12 They are free from lust, their senses are well composed. They are free,slipped loose, like the moon easing free from the teeth of Rāhu [the Eclipse].(498)13 They are quietened and calm, with no passions or anger. They are not goinganywhere in this world once they die: they have given up rebirth.(499)14 They have given up birth and death with no remainder and they have gonebeyond all doubt and uncertainty.(500)15 They are islands unto themselves. They have nothing. They go from place toplace and in every way they are free.(501)16 They know precisely what this sentence means: “There will not be a rebirth:no more becoming. This is my last existence.”(502)17 In the enjoyment of meditation, in the fullness of knowledge and in thestrength of mindfulness a person has full enlightenment and is a shelter formany. When the time comes for giving gifts, this is the person to give to: thisis the person whom the well-intentioned brahmin gives to.’(503)18 ‘Master’, said Māgha, ‘my question has certainly brougnt full rewards for me!You’ve explained to me what giftworthy means, and who these people are, for youknow it as it really is — you have seen this in accordance with fact.(504)19 But tell me one thing, Master. When a charitable and well-intentioned laymanmakes an offering or gives away food and drink, how should he do it to make theoffering successful?’(505)20 ‘Make your offering, Māgha’, said the Master. ‘As you make it be pleased inmind. Make your mind completely calm and contented. Focus and fill theoffering-mind with the giving. From this secure position you can be free fromill-will.(506)21 If you have no rush of passions and can get rid of ill-will, and if youdevelop the mind of boundless loving-kindness with constant care and alertness,night and day, then the loving-kindness will spread infinitely in eachdirection.’(507)22 ‘O Master’, said Māgha, ‘tell me who can be pure, who can be free, who can beenlightened? How do you get to the Brahma-world on your own? O Master of wisdom,please tell me the answers! O Master, you yourself can witness that today I haveseen Brahmā, for you are the same as Brahmā to us — it’s true! O Master, ShiningLight, please tell me how a man can get to the Brahma-world!’(508)23 ‘Māgha’, said the Master, I will say this to you: when the third of the threequalities of perfect giving is completed by giving to a giftworthy person, then,Māgha, the completed act of giving itself takes the giver, the man whosepractice is giving, into the world of Brahma.’(509)Then Māgha the young brahmin spoke in praise of the Master. It is amazing,Venerable Gotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if one might raisewhat has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the wayto him who has gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so that those whohave eyes may see objects, so likewise has the Truth been explained by VenerableGotama in various ways. Therefore, I take refuge in him, his Dhamma and hisSangha. May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who henceforth hastaken refuge in him for the rest of his life.’Note1 [part0009.html#en3b_1] Repeated after vv. 5–16.6. Sabhiya Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_6]Sabhiya [part0006.html#s3_6]A wandering ascetic questions the Buddha and the six contemporary teachersThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was staying in the Bamboo Grove by thesquirrels’ feeding-ground at Rājagaha. Now at about this time a wandering holyman was visited by a deva. The wanderer’s name was Sabhiya and this deva had, inan earlier life, been a relative of his. The deva taught Sabhiya a list ofquestions that he should put to any holy man he met. ‘If you find any priest orhermit who can answer them, then’, said the deva, ‘you should take that man asyour teacher and commit yourself to a life of purity with him.’So Sabhiya the wanderer learnt the questions by heart and set off to find allthe great religious leaders of the time, all the famous teachers who had theirown groups of followers and monks. He saw, successively, Purāṇa Kassapa,Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesa-kambali, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Saimage[../images/00004.jpeg]jaya Belaṭṭhiputta and the Jain teacher Nātaputta[Mahāvīra], but none of them could answer his questions. Indeed, all of them gotangry or uneasy when they saw that they had failed and started asking Sabhiyaquestions in return.‘I might as well give up and go back to easy living and a life of pleasure’,thought Sabhiya. But then he thought of something else — there was one otherholy man famous for his teaching and the number of his followers, a young mannamed Gotama. Why not ask him? ‘But he’, thought Sabhiya, ‘is very young and hasnot been a holy man for long. How could he know more than the other, olderteachers I have seen?’ Another thought occurred to Sabhiya: a holy man should berespected for his power and his dignity, not for his age; so he decided afterall to go and see the holy man Gotama.Off he went on his pilgrimage until one day he came to Rāja-gaha. There, in theBamboo Grove by the squirrels’ feeding-ground, he found the Master. He greetedhim politely, paid his respects and, after sitting down to one side, spoke inverse to the Master:1 ‘I have come to you’, said Sabhiya, ‘full of confusion and doubt. I so muchwant to have these questions answered — please settle them for me once and forall and explain each answer to me one by one’.(510)2 ‘You have come a long way, Sabhiya’, said the Buddha, ‘with these questionsthat you so much want to have answered. I will settle them for you once and forall and explain each answer to you one by one.(511)3 Ask me whatever you want, Sabhiya, and I will explain it and clear up yourconfusion.’Sabhiya thought, ‘It is amazing, it is surprising; other recluses and brahminsdid not even permit me to raise the questions, but the ascetic Gotama has atlast permitted me to raise them.’ He was glad, elated and encouraged and so hequestioned the Buddha.(512)4 ‘What, Master, must you do to be called a monk [bhikkhu]. What does it mean tobe gentle? What is the meaning of restraint? And what does it mean to be aBuddha, to be enlightened? Please explain these four things to me, Master.’(513)And this is what the Master told him:5 ‘A monk, Sabhiya, is a person who has created a path for himself by which hehas attained complete tranquility, over coming doubt. He, having abandoned beingand non-being, has perfected the religious life and has destroyed re-becoming.(514)6 He is constantly equanimous and mindful. He does not harm anyone anywhere. Arecluse is one who has crossed over [to Nibbāna]. He is unconfused. He has noevil traits. Such a one is gentle: he has crossed the ocean [of Saṃsāra].(515)7 He whose senses are cultivated in connection with the whole world, bothinternal and external; with penetrative understanding of this and the otherworld, the cultivated and restrained person awaits with equanimity the time ofdeath.(516)8 He who has scrutinized the entirety of thoughts and cyclic existence,consisting of both birth and death, the dustless, stainless, pure one who hasattained the destruction of birth is called the Buddha [enlightened].’(517)Sabhiya was thrilled to hear these words and went on to ask another set ofquestions.9 ‘What do you have to do to be a brahmin? What does it mean to renounce, to bea holy man, a samana? What does it mean to be cleansed, and who can be called ahero? Please explain these things to me, Master.’(518)And so the Master replied:10 ‘A brahmin is a person who, having avoided all evil, is stainless, good,composed and poised. Overcoming the cycle of existence he has become perfect. Heis unattached and steadfast.(519)11 A holy man is a man who has calmed himself, is a man who has abandoned meritand demerit. Knowing this world and the other, he is dustless and has overcomebirth and death.(520)12 Washing away all evil connected with the whole world, both inner and outer,and with regard to men and gods he does not engage in conceptual thought. He iscalled the cleansed.(521)13 Someone who lives in the world without doing wrong, someone who has untiedall ties and chains, someone who does not hang on to anything anywhere, who isreleased, is called a steadfast hero.’(522)Sabhiya, thrilled with these answers, went on to ask more questions:14 ‘Who do enlightened men considered to be a world-winner? What does it mean tobe skilled? What does it mean to be a man of understanding, and who is entitledto be called a wise man? Please, Master, explain these things to me.’(523)And so the Master answered him:15 ‘You ask what a world-winner is. There are three worlds: the world of men,the world of gods and the world of Brahma-beings. A world-winner examines andunderstands all three. He has pulled up by the roots his links to these worldsand he is freed. This is the state called world-winner.(524)16 You ask what skill is. There are three kinds of treasures or stores: thosestocked by men, those stocked by gods and those stocked by Brahma-beings. Theman of skill examines and understands all three. He has pulled up by the rootshis links to these stocks and he is freed. This is the state called skill.(525)17 A man of understanding is a man who has looked at his senses. He hasunderstood how the senses work both in the mind and in the outside world. Hesees with clarity, he has gone beyond “black and white’’ and is steadfast.(526)18 And a man of wisdom? A wise man knows the Way of Distinguishing good from badin connection with both the inner and the outer world. Both gods and men respecthim: he has broken the chains and ropes.’(527)Sabhiya, thrilled with these answers, went on to ask another set of questions:19 ‘What do you have to achieve to be a man of knowledge? By what does onebecome an insightful person? How does one become an energetic man? And what doesthoroughbred mean? Please explain these things to me, Master.’(528)The Master told him this:20 ‘When a man has looked at knowledge and understood all that is known to holymen and priests, then all the longings and yearnings for sensations disappear.Going beyond all knowledge he is a man of knowledge.(529)21 Understanding the obsession of name and form [psycho-physical personality],the root of the disease both internal and external, he is freed from the ties toall roots of disease. Due to this reason he is called a steadfast, insightfulperson.(530)22 Here he is free from all evil and has overcome the misery of hell, hence heis energetic. He is zealous, energetic, steadfast.(531)23 You ask about the thoroughbred, the man of high birth: the thoroughbred snapschains. There are internal and external chains and ropes and bonds — nobilitymeans breaking them. It means pulling them up at the roots and being freed. Thisis the state called Thoroughbred.’(532)Sabhiya, thrilled with these answers and full of joy, asked the Master anotherset of questions:24 ‘What do you have to do to be a man of learning? What does it mean to be anAriya, a man of noble birth? What is a man of perfect action? And who isentitled to the name of Wanderer? Please Master, explain these things to me.’(533)And so the Master told him this:25 ‘Having listened to all views he knows with wisdom whatever is blameworthyand blameless. He is victorious, freed and beyond confusion and disturbance. Heis a man of learning.(534)26 The wise one has cut off defilements and attachments. He does not go intolying in a womb. He has got rid of the three drives [greed, hate and delusion)and he does not enter into the mud of conceptual thinking. He is called the manof noble birth.(535)27 Because a man of perfect action has lived and done correctly and with skillhe grasps the Way Things Are. He has no attachment anywhere; he is freed, he hasno [built-in] aversions: this is perfect action.(536)28 And you ask about the Wanderer. When you see which actions hurt and when youleave those actions and are not in those actions, or above or below or beyond orbetween or anywhere near those actions, then you are a Wanderer. When you movefrom place to place and never lose your power to understand, then you are aWanderer. When you lose your hating, wanting, delusion and pride, and when youend your sense of psychophysical individuality, then you have won success, andthen you are a Wanderer.’(537)Sabhiya the wanderer was thrilled at the Master’s words. Full of joy and delighthe got up from his seat and, with his hands folded and his shoulders bared, hespoke to the Master in verse:29 ‘Master, Wise One’, he said, ‘you have done away with the [traditional]sixty-three argumentative theses, the conclusions of recluses which are mereconventions and speculative ideas. You have crossed over the flood and reachedits end!(538)30 You’ve gone to the very furthest point of suffering, and then you’ve gonebeyond it. You, Master, are a Man of Worth; for you, I think, there are no moreinner drives. You are glowing with understanding, radiating wisdom, finishingsuffering and carrying me across!(539)31 You saw what I was looking for, you knew what I was unsure of, and youcarried me across! What mastery! What heights! — this is the ultimate in wisdom.I can give nothing but respect, nothing but honour to this power-house ofgentleness, this brother of the sun!(540)32 You have cleared up all my doubts with the eye of your perfect vision. Sothis is wisdom, this is Full Enlightenment! — this is what it’s like to havenothing in your way.(541)33 All worries have gone, disturbances cut out — and instead you have all thatis calm, controlled, firm and precise.(542)34 When you speak, the gods celebrate; when they hear you, they rejoice. You’rea hero amongst heroes and a power amongst the strong!(543)35 Nowhere in this world is there anyone like you — you are the best and thenoblest being! I salute you and I honour you!(544)36 You are the Buddha, the Enlightened. You are the Master, the Teacher. You arethe Māra-conquering wisdom. You’ve cut out inner bias, inner weighing, and youhave crossed over and you’re taking us, all of us, with you.(545)37 With the rebirth factors ended and the drives destroyed, you are at the endof clinging. You are a lion in the jungle, with nothing to frighten and nothingto fear.(546)38 It’s like a lotus flower on a lake! Good and evil roll off you, ineffective,like water drops off a lotus petal. Let me honour the feet of a conqueror: I amSabhiya the worshipper at the feet of his teacher!’(547)And so Sabhiya the wanderer bent down in respect at the feet of the Buddha andsaid: ‘It is amazing, Venerable Gotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Justas if one might raise what has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden,or point out the way to him who has gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the darkso that those who have eyes may see objects, so likewise has the Truth beenexplained by Venerable Gotama in various ways. Therefore, I take refuge in him,his Dhamma and his Sangha. I wish to enter the homeless life and to receive thehigher ordination near the Venerable Gotama.’Then Sabhiya the wanderer received ordination as a novice and received thehigher ordination near the Buddha.Later, by leading a secluded life, diligently, energetically and with a resolutewill, in a short time he understood, experienced and attained that highestperfection of a noble life for which the sons of good families leave thehousehold life, harmoniously, and take to the life of homelessness. Rebirth hadbeen ended; a noble life had been led: what was to be done had been done andthere was nothing else to be done in this earthly existence: Sabhiya thewanderer had become one of the arahants.7. Sela Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_7]Sela [part0006.html#s3_7]The Buddha convinces Sela and company of his enlightenmentThus have I heard: Once the Buddha was travelling in the company of over 1,250monks and reached a market town called Āpaṇa in Aṅguttarāpa.An ascetic with matted hair called Keṇiya heard thus: that the venerable Gotama,a descendant of the Sākyan clan, who had renounced his family, had arrived atĀpana. And he had also heard these words of praise: ‘That Blessed One is suchsince he is accomplished, fully-enlightened, endowed with wisdom and conduct,sublime, the knower of worlds, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed, theteacher of gods and men, enlightened and glorious.’ He (the Buddha) himselfhaving realized the Truth (Dhamma) makes it known to the world of men and godsincluding ascetics and brahmins. He teaches the Truth which is good in thebeginning, in the middle and at the end, full of meaning, rich in words andwholly complete. He teaches a perfect, pure life. Good, indeed, is the sight ofsuch saints!Then the ascetic Keṇiya went to see the Buddha and after exchanging greetingssat on one side. The Buddha made him very happy with a discourse whereuponKeṇiya invited the Buddha together with his retinue of monks for lunch on thefollowing day. However, the Buddha warned him of the large number of monks inhis company and alluded to Keṇiya’s close friendship with the brahmins.Undeterred, Keṇiya persisted with his invitation and on the third occasion ofasking, the Buddha assented to his request by keeping silent. Thereupon Keṇiyareturned to his hermitage and solicited the assistance of his friends, servantsand relations to help arrange the almsgiving. They all worked in variouscapacities, Keṇiya himself erecting a circular pavilion.At that time a brahmin called Sela lived in Āpaṇa. He was well versed in thethree Vedas, vocabulary, prosody, rhetoric, etymology, history, versed in metre,a grammarian, one not deficient in popular controversy and the science ofphysiognomy. He taught 300 young men. Since he was on friendly terms withKeṇiya, he visited his hermitage along with his pupils. Seeing the briskpreparations going on there he remarked to Keṇiya: ‘Will there be a marriage ofa son or daughter, is a great sacrifice about to take place, or has KingBimbisāra of Magadha been invited for lunch tomorrow together with his largearmy?’Keṇiya replied: ‘Nothing of that kind is going on here. Yet a great sacrifice ofmine is approaching; the ascetic Gotama the Buddha with his disciples has beeninvited for lunch tomorrow.’ ‘Do you say that he is a Buddha!’ ‘Yes, I do.’Then this thought occurred to Sela: ‘The word “Buddha” is, indeed, rare. But inour Vedas the thirty-two signs of a great man are found. There are but twoconditions to such a person and none other: if he leads a household life he willbecome a king, an emperor, a just ruler. If, however, he renounces the householdfor the homeless life he will become a saint, a fully-enlightened one, one whohas removed the covering of the defilements.’ ‘O Keṇiya, where does the Buddhadwell now?’ ‘Where, O Sela, lies the forest belt.’Then Sela, together with his 300 disciples, approached the Buddha and, noticingthe signs of a great man on his body, praised him in a suitable verse:1 O Buddha, you have a perfect body, you are resplendent, wellborn, handsome, ofgolden colour; you have white teeth and you are energetic.(548)2 If there be any signs of a man who is well-born, all those signs of a greatman are on your body.(549)3 You have bright eyes, a handsome countenance; you are great, straight,majestic; you shine like the sun in the midst of the assembly of monks.(550)4 You are a monk of lovely appearance; you have a skin like gold; what advantagecan there be in being an ascetic when you are possessed of such a splendidcomplexion?(551)5 You deserve to be a king, an emperor, the lord of chariots, whose conquestsreach to the limits of the four seas, lord of the Jambu grove [i.e. India].(552)6 Warrior and wealthy kings are devoted to you; O Gotama, exercise your royalpower as a king of kings, a chief of men!(553)The Buddha:7 I am a king, O Sela, supreme king of the Teaching of Truth; I turn the wheelby pure-means — this wheel is irresistible.(554)Sela:8 You maintain that you are a fully-enlightened one, a king of Truth; O Gotama,you say, ‘I turn the wheel by pure means’.(555)9 Who is your general, who is your disciple? Who is the follower of the teacher?Who, hereafter, will turn the wheel of Truth turned by you?(556)The Buddha:10 O Sela, Sāriputta will hereafter turn the incomparable wheel of Truth turnedby me; he walks after the Tathāgata.(557)11 What is to be known is known by me; what is to be cultivated is cultivated byme; what is to be destroyed has been destroyed by me. Therefore, O brahmin, I amthe Buddha.(558)12 O brahmin, subdue your doubts about me, have confidence in me! Rare is it toobtain the sight of fully-enlightened ones.(559)13 O brahmin, of those whose manifestation is rare for you to see, I am arepresentative, an incomparable physician.(560)14 Pre-eminent, matchless, the vanquisher of Māra and his army, having broughtunder subjection all enemies I rejoice, secure from all directions.(561)Sela:15 O friends, pay attention to what the seeing one says! He is a physician, agreat hero, and roars like a lion in the forest.(562)16 Having seen him, pre-eminent, matchless, the vanquisher of Māra and his army,who cannot be overcome even if he be of black origin?1 [part0009.html#en-3c_1](563)17 He who wishes, let him follow me; he who does not wish let him go away, for Ishall now enter the Order under the excellent, wise one.(564)The followers of Sela:18 If the Dispensation of the fully-enlightened one pleases you, we also shallenter the Order under the excellent, wise one!(565)Sela:19 These 300 brahmins, with clasped hands, state: ‘We will practise the purelife under the accomplished one’.(566)The Buddha:20 Sela, the pure life is well proclaimed by me: visible here and now; affordingresult without delay; it is not in vain that one may become a monk whereby onemay train himself diligently.(567)Then the brahmin Sela together with his assembly entered the Order and receivedthe higher ordination under the Buddha.Meanwhile, the ascetic Keṇiya informed the Buddha that lunch was ready.Consequently he went to Keṇiya’s hermitage together with his assembly of monkswhere they were served with sumptuous food. On completion of the meal, theBuddha delighted Keṇiya with these words:21 The principal item in the sacrifice is fire; the principal figure in thehymns is Sāvitri; the king is the principal amongst men; and, amongst rivers,the sea is principal.(568)22 Amongst the planets the moon is the principal; amongst burning objects thesun is principal: amongst those who make offerings, wishing for merit, thecommunity of monks indeed is principal.’(569)Then the Buddha, having delighted Keṇiya with these verses, went away. Then thevenerable Sela together with his assembly retired to a solitary place and ledsuch a strenuous, ardent and energetic existence that, within a short time, inthis present life, by his own understanding, ascertained and possessed himselfof that highest perfection of a pure life for the sake of which men of goodfamily renounce their home for homelessness. Becoming was destroyed; a pure lifehad been led; what had to be done was done and there was nothing else to be donein this existence. Thus the Venerable Sela together with his assembly becamearahants. Thereafter, they went to the Buddha and after making salutationaddressed him in verse:23 ‘On the eighth day previous to this we took refuge in you; O Venerable Sir,within seven nights we were trained in your Dispensation.(570)24 You are the Buddha; you are the teacher; you are the muni who conquered Māra;after cutting off latent inclinations you crossed over the stream of existenceand took over these beings to the other shore.(571)25 The objects of attachment have been overcome by you; the influxes have beendestroyed by you: you are a lion not seizing on “clinging”; you have left behindfear and terror.(572)26 These 300 monks stand here with clasped hands; O hero, stretch out your feetand let the Nāgas2 [part0009.html#en-3c_2] worship the teacher’s feet!’(573)Notes1 [part0009.html#en3c_1] The brahmin’s claim is that he alone is of a bright colour (varṇa) whilst theremaining three divisions of (Hindu) society-warrior (kṣatriya), tradesman(vaiśya) and labourer (sudra) — are black in complexion. The Buddha was born inthe warrior caste and hence the appellation, ‘black origin’ (kaṇābhįiāliko).2 [part0009.html#en3c_2] A kind of demon gifted with miraculous powers. In this instance the term is usedfiguratively in the sense of ‘saints’, ‘chiefs’ or ‘liberated ones’.8. Salla Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_8]The Dart [part0006.html#s3_8]A recollection on death1 Life is unpredictable and uncertain in this world. Life here is difficult,short and bound up with suffering.(574)2 A being, once born, is going to die, and there is no way out of this. When oldage arrives, or some other cause, then there is death. This is the way it iswith living beings.(575)3 When fruits become ripe, they may fall in the early morning. In just the sameway a being, once born, may die at any moment.(576)4 Just as the clay pots made by the potter tend to end up being shattered, so isit with the life of mortals.(577)5 Both the young and the old, whether they are foolish or wise, are going to betrapped by death. All beings move towards death.(578)6 They are overcome by death. They go to the other world. And then not even afather can save his son, or a family their relatives.(579)7 Look: while relatives are watching, tearful and groaning, men are carried offone by one, like cattle being led to the slaughter.(580)8 So death and ageing are endemic to the world. Therefore the wise do not grieveseeing the nature of the world.(581)9 You cannot know his path as to where he has come from, or where he is goingto. So it makes no sense to grieve for him.(582)10 The man who grieves gains nothing. He is doing no more than a foolish man whois trying to hurt himself. If a wise man does it, it is the same for him.(583)11 Peace of mind cannot come from weeping and wailing. On the contrary, it willlead to more suffering and greater pain.(584)12 The mourner will become pale and thin. He is doing violence to himself, andstill he cannot keep the dead alive; his mourning is pointless.(585)13 The man who cannot leave his sorrow behind him only travels further intopain. His mourning makes him a slave to sorrow.(586)14 Look at beings who are facing death, who are living out the results of theirprevious deeds; people are terrified when they see that they are trapped bydeath.(587)15 What people expect to happen is always different from what actually happens.From this comes great disappointment; this is the way the world works.(588)16 A man may live for a hundred years, or even more, but in the end he isseparated from his relatives, and he too leaves life in this world.(589)17 So we can listen and learn from the noble man as he gives up his grief. Whenhe sees that someone has passed away and lived out their life, he says ‘he willnot be seen by me again’.(590)18 When a house is burning, the fire is put out by water. In the same way thewise man, skilful, learned and self-reliant, extinguishes sorrow as soon as itarises in him. It is like the wind blowing away a tuft of cotton.(591)19 The person who is searching for his own happiness should pull out the dartthat he has stuck in himself, the arrow-head of grieving, of desiring, ofdespair.(592)20 The man who has taken out the dart, who has no clinging, who has obtainedpeace of mind, passed beyond all grief, this man, free from grief, is still.(593)9. Vāseṭṭha Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_9]Vāseṭṭha [part0006.html#s3_9]The correct definition of ‘brahmin ‘Thus have I heard: Once the Buddha was staying in the forest of Icchānańgala.Many brahmins were staying there too, famous men like Caimage[../images/00004.jpeg]kī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi and Todeyya — allwell-known, erudite and wealthy brahmins.Amongst these men were two young brahmins, one called Vāseṭṭha and the otherBhāradvāja. Now, one day, as these two young men were walking up and down, theystarted a conversation regarding the factors that make one a brahmin.Bhāradvāja said: ‘It’s to do with one’s family. If one’s family background ispure, and there has been no intermarriage with other castes for sevengenerations back, on either one’s mother’s or one’s father’s side, then one is abrahmin.’But Vāseṭṭha said: ‘If one’s actions are good and duties are observed, then oneis a brahmin.’Bhāradvāja stuck to his theory and Vāseṭṭha stuck to his: neither could convincethe other that he was right. So Vāseṭṭha suggested that they go and ask someoneelse’s advice. ‘Listen’, he said to Bhāradvāja, ‘There is a hermit calledGotama, a prince of the Sākyas, who has renounced his family and of whom it issaid: “That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished, fully-enlightened,endowed with wisdom and conduct, sublime, the knower of worlds, the incomparableleader of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men, enlightened andglorious”. He (the Buddha) himself having realized the Truth (Dhamma) makes itknown to the world of men and gods including ascetics and brahmins. He teachesthe Truth which is good in the beginning, in the middle and at the end, full ofmeaning, rich in words and wholly complete. He teaches a perfect, pure life.Good, indeed, is the sight of such saints!’‘Well, Bhāradvāja’, said Vāseṭṭha, ‘let’s go to this man Gotama, and ask him toclear up this question and we will take it as the recluse Gotama explains it.’‘Very well’, said Bhāradvāja, ‘Let’s go.’ So the two young men went off to lookfor this Master. When they found him they greeted him politely and sat down onone side. Then Vāseṭṭha spoke to the Master in these words:1 ‘Sir, we are both students of the orthodox teachings and we are bothrecognized and accepted as experts in the study of the Vedas. My teacher isPokkharasāti, and my friend here studies with Tārukkha.(594)2 We’ve studied all the commentaries on the three Vedas, and we’re qualified toteach the subjects of metre, grammar and chanting.(595)3 But even so, Gotama, there is one question about which we are in disagreement,namely, the importance of heredity. Bhāradvāja insists that a man is a brahminbecause he is born as one, but I am sure that it’s what a man does that counts.We want you, who have vision, to know about this argument.(596)4 Because we can’t settle it between ourselves, we have come to ask you aboutit. We’ve heard that you are called the fully-enlightened one.(597)5 You are treated with respect by men — they fold their hands when they see youin the same way they go forth to respect the waxing moon.(598)6 You are the eye of the world, Gotama, so we ask you to look at this question —what is it that makes a man a brahmin? Is it by birth or is it by what he does?We can’t work it out, Gotama, so please explain it to us and tell us what abrahmin is.’(599)7 The Buddha answered Vāseṭṭha in these words:‘I shall explain to you in proper order and in accordance with the fact thedifferent kinds of living things, since there are diverse species.(600)8 If you look at trees or grass, although they may not be conscious of it, thereare lots of different kinds and species. There are divergent species.(601)9 Then there are insects, large ones like moths and small ones like ants: withthese creatures too you can see that they are of different kinds and species.(602)10 And in four-footed animals, whatever the size, you can see that they are ofdifferent kinds and species.(603)11 Now look at the creatures that crawl on their bellies, the reptiles and thesnakes — you can see that they are of different kinds and species.(604)12 – 13 Look at the fish and water life — look at birds and the breeds that fly— you can see that they are of different kinds and species.(605–6)14 There is not among men different kinds and species in the manner that theyare found among other species.(607)15 Unlike in other species there is not among men differences in kind or specieswith regard to their eyes, ears, mouths, noses, lips, eyebrows and even theirhair — all are the same type.(608)16 From the neck to the groin, from the shoulder to the hip, from the back tothe chest — it is all of one kind with men.(609)17 Hands, feet, fingers, nails, calves and thighs are all standard, and so arethe features of voice and of colour. Unlike other creatures, men do not havecharacteristics which distinguished them at birth.(610)18 They do not have the variety of inherited features that other creatures have.In fact, in the case of humans, differences are differences only by convention.1[part0009.html#en-3e_1](611)19 For example, Vāseṭṭha, if a man keeps cows and lives off their produce, thenwe know that he is a farmer — we do not call him a brahmin.(612)20 Similarly, when a man lives by a particular craft, then we know he is acraftsman — we do not call him a brahmin.(613)21 If he supports himself by trading then we know he is a merchant not abrahmin.(614)22 When a man gets paid for serving other people, then we call him a servantrather than a brahmin.(615)23 A man who lives by taking other people’s things is known as a thief ratherthan a brahmin.(616)24 And a bowman who sells his skill is known as a soldier — we do not call him abrahmin.(617)25 A man whose work is performing rites and ceremonies is known as a priest andnot as a brahmin.(618)26 And the man who lives off the produce of countries and villages is known as alandlord or a king — we do not call him a brahmin.(619)27 I do not call a man a brahmin because of his mother or because of hisbreeding. Just because a man is entitled to be called “Sir”, it does not meanthat he is free from habit and attachment. He who is free from attachment, hewho is free from grasping is the person I call a brahmin.(620)28 When all the chains are shattered, when there is no more agitation, and a manhas freed himself and thrown off his shackles — that is the person I call abrahmin.(621)29 He who has cut off the strap [of ignorance] and harness [of false views], whohas removed obstacles and is enlightened, is one I call a brahmin.(622)30 He who, without getting annoyed, endures insults and violence, whose strengthand army is endurance, is one I call a brahmin.(623)31 There is no anger and there is no ignorance — there is only strength ofrestraint and the power of pure action. So there is no habitual repetition, norebirth. This is what I call [being] a brahmin.(624)32 Like a water drop on a lotus leaf, a mustard seed on the top of a needle,sense-desires roll off and leave no trace in him. It is such a person I call abrahmin.(625)33 Losing weight and dropping a chain — here, right here in this world, he cansee how even suffering has an end. This is whom I call a brahmin.(626)34 One who is deep in wisdom, wise, proficient in what the right or the wrongpath is, who has reached the ultimate goal, is one I call a brahmin.(627)35 No props, no dependency, no need to mix with other people, whether propertyowners or wandering monks — the minimum being good enough; this is what“brahmin” means.(628)36 To lay down the weapons of violence, to stop killing any being, to stopcausing others to kill any being; this is what “brahmin” means.(629)37 He who shows no anger towards those who are angry, peaceful towards those whoare violent, not grasping among those who are bent on grasping, is one I call abrahmin.(630)38 He whose wanting, hating, pride and envy have dropped away, like the mustardseed which has rolled off the needle top, is one I call a brahmin.(631)39 He who speaks words which are not harsh and words which are meaningful andtrue, words which do not rouse another’s anger, is one I call a brahmin.(632)40 No possessions, no things have been appropriated, whatever the size, quantityor value; this is what “brahmin” means.(633)41 No expectations, not a hankering for this world or for any other: he isuntied, released; this is what “brahmin” means.(634)42 An absence of wanting — questions and doubts disappear in knowledge and heplunges into the absence of death; this is what “brahmin” means.(635)43 He who has gone beyond the [impurity of both] merit and demerit, who is freefrom grief and defilement and is pure; this is what “brahmin” means.(636)44 The clear, calm, stainless, moonlike quality where the shackles of constantbecomings are cut and thrown away; this is what “brahmin” means.(637)45 He who has gone beyond the rough and dangerous road of cyclic existence anddelusion, who has crossed over and gone beyond, the contemplative, passionlessand doubt-free, one who is calmed without grasping, is one I call a brahmin.(638)46 Sense pleasures have gone — he lets them go for the life of a wandererwithout a home. The sensual pleasure of constant becoming has gone, thrown away;this is what “brahmin” means.(639)47 Craving-demandings have gone — he lets them go for the life of a wandererwithout a home. The hankering after constant becomings has gone, thrown away;this is what “brahmin” means.(640)48 The dead-weight on the backs of men, the loads that weigh down even gods —all these burdens are discarded, thrown off and overcome: he is untied from theyoke, released. This is what “brahmin” means.(641)49 Avoiding delight and aversion, he is cooled and free from the bases [thatlead to rebirth]. He is a hero who has overcome all the worlds and is one I calla brahmin.(642)50 He who has fully comprehended how beings come to be and how they cease to be,is unattached, faring rightly and enlightened, is one I call a brahmin.(643)51 He whose destiny cannot be known by gods and human beings, the person who haseradicated the passions, a worthy one, is one I call a brahmin.(644)52 As for possessions, he has nothing — nothing in the past, nothing in thefuture, nothing in the present. He does not hold on to anything at all; freedfrom clinging, this is what I call a brahmin.(645)53 A hero — a man of greatness, of prominence, of wisdom, a man of fearlessnessand victory. Non-attached; washed [in the waters of wisdom]; enlightened. Thisis what I call a brahmin.(646)54 He knows his earlier lives, he has seen the other forms of life, the woefulstates and the happy states. This is the attainment: reaching the end of thechain-links of births. This is what I call a brahmin.(647)55 So what of all these titles, names and races? They are mere worldlyconventions. They have come into being by common consent.(648)56 This false belief has been deeply ingrained in the minds of the ignorant fora long time and [still] these ignorant ones say to us: “One becomes a brahmin bybirth.”(649)57 [On the contrary,) no one is born a brahmin; no one is born a non-brahmin. Abrahmin is a brahmin because of what he does; a man who is not a brahmin is nota brahmin because of what he does. (650)58 A farmer is a farmer because of what he does and a craftsman is a craftsmanbecause of what he does.(651)59 A merchant, a servant, a thief, a soldier, a priest or a king: each of themis what he is because of what he does.(652)60 So the wise men see action as it has really come to be. They are proficientin the fruits of action and they are seers of dependent origination.(653)61 The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causalactions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixedlike the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the pin of its axle shaft.(654)62 A brahmin is as a result of self-restraint, wholesome living andself-control. This is the essence of Brahmin.(655)63 So, Vāseṭṭha, let this be clear: there are people who are wise andexperienced in all the three areas of knowledge [i.e. the Vedas], who are calmand have finished with the chain-links of repeated becoming. These people shouldbe known like Brahmā or Indra.’(656)Then Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha: ‘It is amazing, VenerableGotama, it is wonderful, Venerable Gotama! Just as if one might raise what hasbeen overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the way to him whohas gone astray, or hold out a lamp in the dark so that those who have eyes maysee objects, so likewise has the Truth been explained by Venerable Gotama invarious ways. Therefore, we take refuge in him, his Dhamma and his Sangha. Maythe Venerable Gotama accept us as lay followers who henceforth have taken refugein him for the rest of their lives.’Note1 [part0009.html#en3e_1] It should be borne in mind that, when describing the physical characteristics ofhuman beings, the Buddha only referred to his fellow Indians of the northeastand central parts of the subcontinent.The Buddha is here referring to observable differences from his own personalexperience and later explains that actions (kamma) and behaviour are the keys toperfection and enlightenment. The natural corollary of rebirth, however, canlead to people being born in ‘high’ or ‘low’ estates — i.e. environments thatcan either encourage or retard spiritual (or even material) growth. Thus,although the potentiality for understanding is present in every person, kammaensures a perpetual inequality of results.It would, therefore, be irrelevant to quote this passage out of context in anydebate on ‘racial equality’, as was done by K. N. Jayatilleke and G. P.Malalasekera in their essay, Buddhism and the Race Question (UNESCO, Paris,1958; repr. BPS, Kandy 1974). For a commonsense Buddhist approach to this issuesee Philip Eden Human Progress: Reality or Illusion? (BPS 1974).10. Kokālika Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_10]Kokālika [part0006.html#s3_10]The dire consequences of unwholesome speechOnce, when the Buddha was staying in the Jetavana Monastery at Sāvaṭṭhi, a monkcalled Kokālika came up to him and said:‘Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of unwholesome desires. They have beenquite taken over by unwholesome desires.’The Buddha answered:‘Kokālika, don’t say such a thing! Have confidence in your mind as far as theyare concerned; Sāriputta and Moggallāna are well behaved.’But Kokālika repeated his accusation against the two disciples. The Buddhareplied as before, but the monk again insulted the disciples in the same way.For a third time he was asked by the Buddha not to do so. Then Kokālika, makinga deep bow to the Buddha, got up and went away.He had only gone a short way when he started to feel ill. His whole body cameout in boils, boils the size of mustard seeds. These boils began to swell,growing bit by bit until they were as large as peas. Then they grew as large asbeans, as eggs, as crab apples and as quinces. At this point they burst open,oozing pus and blood. From the illness Kokālika died and, as a result of theill-will that he had shown, he was reborn in one of the states of misery whichis known as the Paduma or Lotus.Towards the end of that night the Brahmā Sahampati came to the Buddha and toldhim how Kokālika had died, and how his ill-will had caused rebirth to take placein the Paduma. Early next morning the Buddha called all the monks together toexplain what he had told him about Kokālika’s death: ‘Monks, the life of a beingin the Paduma state lasts so long that we can hardly describe it in numbers.Kokālika has taken birth there because of the ill-will he had for Sāriputta andMoggallāna.’And, as Teacher, the Buddha went on to say this:1 A person that is born is born with an axe in his mouth. He whose speech isunwholesome cuts himself with this axe.(657)2 When a man praises someone who should be blamed, or attacks someone worthy ofpraise, then this man is accumulating evil with his mouth and this evil will notlead to happiness.(658)3 It is little harm if one loses money in gambling with dice, even losingeverything, including oneself; but if one bears ill-will towards well-conductedones it is greater harm indeed.(659)4 Insulting men of real worth, bearing ill-will in thought and speech, leads toaeons upon aeons in the states of misery.(660)5 Lying leads to these states. Doing something and then saying, ‘I didn’t do it’— this is the same as lying. In terms of death and rebirth both actions areequivalent: at death you must face the consequences of unwholesome actions.(661)6 When a man attacks someome who is peaceful, pure and uncorrupted, then theattack turns back on the foolish man who started it as dust thrown against thewind.(662)7 The person who has a greedy disposition insults others with words. He isfaithless, greedy, miserly and slanderous.(663)8 If you are a man like this, untrue and unworthy, slanderous, evil andmisbehaved, mean, bad, you had better not talk too much or else you will come toa state of misery!(664)9 You are spreading pollution when you act like this. It is an insult to men whodo good, and it is a polluted action in itself. If you accumulate actions likethis you will fall into the pool of misery-states.(665)10 Why is this? It is because the things that men do just do not disappear intothe past. They will come back to us, they will return to their maker. A manwhose actions are polluted is foolish: in time he will feel the pain of ithimself.(666)11 The pain he will feel will be like the pain of iron bars that are thrashinghim and iron stakes that are piercing him. In a state like that, what he eatsfeels like red-hot balls of iron.(667)12 Nothing there is said that is not hard and painful. There are no pleasingwords of consolation, nothing offers escape for the sufferers in this state,this state where the world is a furnace, where even a bed is of red-hot ashes.(668)13 Tangled up in nets, crushed by hammer-blows, they are immersed in thickdarkness stretching out on all sides.(669)14 Then they find themselves in a cauldron, burning and boiling, bubbling up anddown in the heat of the furnace, heaving their bodies around.(670)15 The man of unwholesome deeds is in this state, stewing and boiling in bloodand rotten flesh. Wherever he moves to he rots from the touch of this putridmash.(671)16 Then the man of unwholesome deeds boils in water infested with worms. Hecannot stay still — the boiling pots, round and smooth like bowls, have nosurfaces which he can get hold of.(672)17 Then he is in the jungle of sword blades, limbs mangled and hacked, thetongue hauled by hooks, the body beaten and slashed.(673)18 Then he is in Vetaraṇī, a watery state difficult to get through, with its twostreams that cut like razors. The poor beings fall into it, living out theirunwholesome deeds of the past.(674)19 Gnawed by hungry jackals, ravens and black dogs, and speckled vultures andcrows, the sufferers groan.(675)20 Such a state is experienced by the man of unwholesome deeds. It is a state ofabsolute suffering. So a sensible person in this world is as energetic andmindful as he can be.(676)21 The Paduma state lasts a long time. The experts work out its length in termsof the number of cartloads of sesame seeds that would be emptied if one seedwere removed every hundred years. They say the cartloads would number fivethousand one hundred and twenty million.(677)22 And as long as the misery-states are called miserable by people in thisworld, for so long will people have to go on living through those states.Take care therefore and with pure, wholesome and friendly qualities constantlywatch the movements of mind and the movements of speech.(678)11. Nālaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_11]Nālaka [part0006.html#s3_11]The birth of the future Buddha and a description of the qualities ofenlightenment1 One day, during the afternoon siesta, the sage Asita noticed that the thirtygods had all gathered together. Full of joy and overflowing with praises toIndra, they were dressed in the purest white and waved their robes and bannerswith delight.(679)2 Seeing all this excitement, Asita respectfully asked the gods what it was thatthey were celebrating. ‘Why are you all so happy and joyful?’ he asked, ‘What’sall this waving and whirling of banners for?(680)3 I’ve never seen such excitement as this, not even when the gods won theirbattle against the Asuras. What can they have seen now? It must be somethingwonderful for there to be all this rejoicing.(681)4 They are singing and shouting, playing music, dancing around, clapping andwaving — tell me why, you people from the top of Mount Meru! Please answer myquestions, put my mind at rest!’(682)5 ‘In a village called Lumbinī, in the Sākyan country’, answered the gods, ‘abodhisatta has been born! A being set on Buddha-hood has been born, asuperlative being without comparison, a precious pearl of the health andgoodness of the human world. That’s why we’re so glad, so excited, so pleased.(683)6 Of all beings this one is perfect, this man is the pinnacle, the ultimate, thehero of creatures! This is the man who, from the forest of the Masters, will setthe wheel of Teaching turning — the roar of the lion, King of Beasts!’(684)7 When he heard this news, Asita left the Tusita heaven and went straight to thepalace of Suddhodana, King of the Sākyas. There, when he had sat down, he saidto the Sākyas: ‘Where is the prince? I would like to see him.’(685)8 So they took the hermit Asita, the ‘Unattached’, as he was called, and showedhim the new-born prince. He was shining, glowing and beautiful. It was likeseeing molten gold in the hands of a master craftsman as he takes it out of thefurnace.(686)9 To see the prince was to see brightness — the brightness of the flames of afire; the brightness of the star constellations crossing the night sky; thebrightness and clarity of the autumn sun shining on a cloudless day. It was asight that filled the hermit with joy, and he experienced great delight.(687)10 In the sky above, invisible beings were holding up a vast canopy out incircles from its centre and stretched over a thousand spokes. Other gods wavedyak-tailed fans on golden stems, and these gods too were invisible.(688)11 The long-haired sage, the ‘Dark Splendour’, as he was called, looked at thebaby lying on the orange clothes, shining like a golden coin, with the whitesunshade held up above him. With great joy he picked him up.(689)12 Now the lion of the Sākyas was in the arms of a man who had waited for him, aman who could recognize all the signs on his body — a man who now, filled withdelight, raised his voice to say these words: ‘There is nothing to compare withthis: this is the ultimate, this is the perfect man!’(690)13 Just then the hermit remembered that he was going to die quite soon — and hefelt so sad at this that he began to cry. The Sākyas asked him why he wascrying: ‘Is the prince in some danger?’ they asked.(691)14 To settle their worries, the sage explained to them why he felt sad. ‘No’, hesaid, ‘there will not be any danger or threat to the prince’s life, as far as Ican see. In fact, for him there won’t be any obstacles at all. There couldn’t befor him; he is not an ordinary being. [Listen carefully:](692)15 This prince will come to the fulfilment of perfect Englightenment; thisprince of supremely pure vision will start turning the wheel of Truth out ofcompassion for the well-being of many. The religious life will be fullyexpounded.(693)16 But for me there is a grain of sadness and pain in this. For I will not livemuch longer now and during his life I shall die. So I won’t be able to see thisman of such unparalleled strength teaching how things are — and that’s the onlyreason that I felt sad.’(694)17 The Sākyas were thrilled to hear what he said, and he left them, went outfrom the inner rooms of the palace and set out to follow the practices of a pureand virtuous life. But as he was leaving he began to think of his nephew,Nālaka, and, full of compassion, he stopped to tell him about this man ofunequalled strength and his teaching.(695)18 ‘One day’, he said to his nephew, ‘You will hear someone talking about “aBuddha”. You will hear of a man who has reached full enlightenment by followingthe correct path. When you hear this, go and find out all the details of thisteaching — go and live with this Master, this Lord, and follow the practices ofa pure life.’(696)19 And Nālaka, helped by the merit he had accumulated by many years of good andwholesome actions, remained alert and restrained, always moderating the play ofhis senses, looking forward to the appearance of this conquering hero.(697)20 In time, the news did come: the Buddha started to turn the teaching wheel. OnAsita’s advice Nālaka went off to find this noble sage and, having done so,asked the man of wisdom about the highest wisdom:(698)(The end of the verses of the prologue)21 ‘What Asita told me many years before has turned out true’, said Nālaka, ‘Ican see that now. You, Gotama, have reached the perfection of all things; may Inow put a question to you, Master?(699)22 I have lived for sometime as a wanderer and now I would like to live as amonk, so please, answer this question for me: What is the highest wisdom state?’(700)23 And the sublime Master replied, ‘I will explain the wisdom state to you, astate which is hard to get and hard to put into effect. Come, be alert and fullof effort.(701)24 Develop the mind of equilibrium. You will always be getting praise and blame,but do not let either affect the poise of the mind: follow the calmness, theabsence of pride.(702)25 Forms, both high and low come across, like tongues of flame from a log. Womentempt the sage but you should not develop the desire for them.(703)26–27 Being free from sensuous union, without aversion or attachment towardsbeings, however weak or strong they may be, comparing oneself to others in suchterms as “Just as I am so are they, just as they are so am I”, he should neitherkill nor cause others to kill. (704–5)28 The impulse “I want” and the impulse “I’ll have” — lose them! That is wheremost people get stuck — without those, you can use your eyes to guide youthrough this suffering state.(706)29 Eating little and moderate in food, with few wants and free from greed, he isunafflicted by wants. He is desireless and calmed.(707)30 [This is the pattern that the man of wisdom follows.) He goes roundcollecting gifts for his meals, and then he goes off to the edge of the woodsand sits down under a tree.(708)31 He applies himself to meditation practice. With his skill in this practice hecan find it pleasurable. He can make himself joyful, living under a tree on theedge of the wood, meditating.(709)32 He spends the night like this and in the morning sets off for the village. Hedoes not get distracted, he does not get excited by the gifts and invitationsthat people offer him there.(710)33 Once he has reached the village he does not rush from door to door, and whenhe is begging for food he does not talk about it or pass any hints.(711)34 He simply says, “This is what I’ve been given: that’s good”, or “I haven’tbeen given anything: that’s fine”. With this attitude towards begging he canreturn undisturbed to the tree.(712)35 So he wanders around with begging bowl in hand, although he is not dumb heseems to be dumb. He accepts even the smallest gift or the slightest giverwithout scorn and without pride.(713)36 The methods, both quick and slow, by which Nibbāna may be discerned haveindeed been expounded by the ascetic Gotama. It [Nibbāna] is never discernedtwice; this perceiving of the beyond is realized gradually [by the four stages1[part0009.html#en-3f_1]].(714)37 When a person is desireless, when a monk has extinguished the river ofbecomings, when he has given up all the activities of duty and obligation — he“ought to” and “ought not to” — then the fever is past.’(715)38 ‘Yes said the sublime Master, ‘I will explain the wisdom state to you. Berazor sharp. Keep your tongue relaxed so the tip is resting on the roof of yourmouth and your stomach is quiet and [your appetite] restrained.(716)39 Let go of the chained minds, the states involving attachment. Do not spendmuch time thinking about irrelevancies. No defilements, no ties, no dependency:only dedication to the practices of a pure life.(717)40 In the discipline of living alone, in the service of hermits, it is thesilence of solitude that is wisdom. When the solitude becomes a source ofpleasure,(718)41 Then it shines in all the ten directions. This is the sound of the meditationof wisdom, of those who have let sense pleasures go. When you, a follower, hearthis sound then you grow in confidence, modesty and strength of practice.(719)42 Listen to the sound of water. Listen to the water running through chasms androcks. It is the minor streams that make a loud noise; the great waters flowsilently.(720)43 The hollow resounds and the full is still. Foolishness is like a half-filledpot; the wise man is a lake full of water.(721)44 The hermit can talk of many things with good sense and precision. He candescribe the Way Things Are from a position of knowledge. There is much that hecan talk about from that position.(722)45 But when a man of knowledge retains his self-control, when a man of knowledgespeaks only a little, then you have found a man of wisdom, a man for whom thatsilence is appropriate and deserved. Such a man has found the Silence ofWisdom’.(723)Note1 [part0009.html#en-3f_1] See note 3 to the Ratana Sutta (above).12. Dvayatānupassanā Sutta [part0006.html#sec3_12]Origination and Cessation (of suffering) [part0006.html#s3_12]Thus have I heard: Once the Buddha was staying in the Eastern Park ofMigāramātu’s estate at Sāvatthi. One evening on a full-moon day he was sittingin the open air with all the monks gathered round him. He saw that they weresilent and so he spoke to them.‘Monks’, he said, ‘It sometimes happens in this world that things are saidconcerning skilful states, distinguished and liberating statements are made thatlead to full enlightenment.Now, monks, why should you bother to listen to those statements? People may askyou this same question, and, if they do, you should answer them like this:“It is for the purpose of knowing two things as they have come to be.”They may ask you what these two ideas are, if they do, you should answer themlike this:The first insight is this: this is suffering and this is what causes it. Thesecond insight is this: that is where suffering stops, and that is how you getthere.”These are the twofold insights; grasp them together and, in the course of a lifeof energy, dedication and care, you can expect one of two results; there willeither be the fruit of perfect knowledge, or, if any essential components arenot yet exhausted, there will at least be no further births.’When the Buddha had said this to the monks, he went on, as Teacher, to explain:1 There are people who do not understand suffering. They do not know where itcomes from, where it totally ends, or how to get to where it ends.(724)2 So, without a chance to emancipate the mind or achieve emancipation throughknowledge, they cannot effect an ending; they can only go on and on, being bornand getting old.(725)3 There are also people who comprehend suffering, who know how it happens, whereit totally ends and how to get to where it ends.(726)4 They have got the emancipation of mind and the emancipation through knowledge:now they can effect an ending: no more going on and on, being born and gettingold.(727)This is the proper twofold insight, but you may be asked to describe it inanother way and that you could do like this:‘One insight is that grasping is the basis of all suffering. The other insightis that by the complete cooling and cessation of all this grasping there is nomore arising of suffering.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.5 There are many kinds of suffering in this world and all of them grow from thesame source — grasping. When a man knows no better he gives way to this graspingand, slowed and dulled, he goes through one misery after another. So do notcreate it for yourselves — use your knowledge to see how suffering begins anddevelops in attachment.(728)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that ignorance is the basis of all suffering. The other is thatby the complete cooling and cessation of ignorance no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.6 Constant travelling from birth to birth, from this form to that form, againand again — this is what results from ignorance.(729)7 It is due to this ignorance that people [’s minds) become dulled and muddled,that they go on endlessly wandering from life to life. But if you walk towardsknowledge, you leave these rebirths behind, you do not go on becoming.(730)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that: impulses are the basis of all forms of suffering. Theother is that by the complete cooling and cessation of impulses no moresuffering is produced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.8 Every form of suffering grows out of a mental impulse. Eradicate the impulsesand no more suffering is produced.(731)9 Consider this harmful consequence of the impulses, that they are the basis ofsuffering. By the complete calming of the impulses and the stopping of the trainof perceptions, suffering disappears.(732)10 Wise men understand this in accordance with fact. With right knowledge thewise ones overcome the yoke of Māra. There is no more rebirth for them.(733)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that consciousness is the basis of all suffering. The other isthat by the complete cooling and cessation of consciousness no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.11 Every form of suffering grows out of consciousness. By the cessation ofconsciousness no more suffering is produced.(734)12 Consider this harmful consequence of consciousness, that it is the basis ofsuffering. But once consciousness is quietened, a person’s craving ends: totalcalm is realized.(735)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that contact is the basis of suffering. The other is that by thecomplete cooling and cessation of contact no more suffering is produced.’These are the two insights: grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.13 For some people, contact, the point where sense plus object meet, isenthralling. And so they are washed by the tides of being, drifting along anempty, pointless road. Nowhere is there any sign of broken chains.(736)14 But others come to understand their sense activity and because theyunderstand it, the stillness fills them with delight. They see just what contactdoes, and so their craving ends; they realize the total calm.(737)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that sensations are the basis of all suffering. The other isthat by the complete cooling and cessation of sensation no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.15 – 16 Whether it is pleasurable sensation or unpleasant sensation or neutralsensation, whatever is sensed internally or externally one should understand allthis as suffering, as deluding experience, as fragile experience; one should seewith insight its rising and falling nature and by this means should be detachedtowards it. The monk becomes free from craving and completely calmed by theelimination of sensations.(738–9)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that the thirst of craving is the basis of suffering. The otheris that by the complete cooling and cessation of this thirst no more sufferingis produced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.17 When a man walks hand in hand with the thirst of craving, he will wander frombirth to birth, now here, now there, and with never an end in sight.(740)18 Consider this harmful consequence of craving, that it is the basis ofsuffering, and with this knowledge you could let the thirst dissolve. Theclinging would go with it and you would be free to live, always mindful, as awanderer.(741)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that clinging is the basis of all suffering. The other is thatby the complete cooling and cessation of clinging no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.19 Becoming is dependent on clinging. When one becomes one comes to suffering. Aperson who is born dies also. This is the production of suffering.(742)20 And so, perfected in understanding, the wise dissipate all clinging. Theyhave seen how the forces of becoming can be stopped. So they do not go towardsmore births.(743)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that effort is the basis of all suffering. The other insight isthat by the complete cooling and cessation of effort no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.21 Every form of suffering grows out of effort. Eradicate effort and no moresuffering is produced.(744)22 Consider this evil consequence of effort, that it is the basis of suffering.But when all effort has been abandoned, there is the freedom of the effortless.(745)23 For the person whose feverish thirst to be is destroyed, and the mind hasbecome calm, the cycle of birth and rebirth is left behind and there is no morecoming back for rebirth.(746)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that nutrients are the basis of all suffering. The other is thatby the complete cooling and cessation of nutrients no more suffering isproduced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.24 Every form of suffering grows out of nutrients. Eradicate these nutrients andno more suffering is produced.(747)25 Look at the harmful consequences of nutrients, that they are the basis ofsuffering. When you have comprehended all nutrients you do not get attached tothem.(748)26 When someone fully understands what is healthy then he can do away with themental poisons. He can stand firm and clearsighted in the practice of theTeachings, as a person fulfilled, as a being beyond definition.(749)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that mental agitations are the basis of all suffering. The otheris that by the complete cooling and cessation of these agitations no moresuffering is produced.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.27 Every form of suffering grows out of agitation. Eradicate agitation and nomore suffering is produced.(750)28 Consider this harmful consequence of agitations, that they are productive ofmisery. Therefore, give up agitation, break the impulses and free from agitationand clinging, let the monk mindfully wander along.(751)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that there is trembling for one who is dependent. The other isthat the one independent does not tremble.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with effort, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.29 The independent man does not tremble or get confused. But a man who isdependent on something is clutching, grasping at existence in one form oranother, and he cannot escape from existences.(752)30 Consider this evil consequence, that there is grave danger in beingdependent. Therefore, relying on nothing, the mindful monk wanders on, free fromclinging.(753)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that there is more calm in the formless than in the formed. Theother is that there is more calm in cessation than in the formless’.These are the two points; grasp them together and, with effort, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.31 Beings who do not understand cessation will come back to the process ofrebecoming, whether those beings be those of the sphere of form or of the sphereof the formless.(754)32 But those beings who, having understood the nature of form, are wellestablished in the formless and free themselves in cessation are the ones wholeave death behind them.(755)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that what the world at large, inclusive of its māras, recluses,brahmins, as well as men and rulers, thinks of as truth, the higher beings, themen of worth, see quite clearly, through their superior wisdom, as false. Theother is that what the world at large, . . . thinks of as false, the higherbeings, the men of worth, see quite clearly as the truth.’These are the two insights; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.33 In the world, inclusive of its gods, substance is seen in what isinsubstantial. They are tied to their psychophysical beings and so they thinkthat there is some substance, some reality in them.(756)34 But whatever be the phenomenon through which they think of seeking their selfidentity, it turns out to be transitory. It becomes false, for what lasts for amoment is deceptive.(757)35 The state that is not deceptive is Nibbāna: that is what the men of worthknow as being real. With this insight into reality their hunger ends: cessation,total calm.(758)There is another way of describing this twofold insight:‘One insight is that what the world at large, . . . thinks of as pleasure, thehigher beings see quite clearly is suffering. The other is that what the worldat large, . . . thinks of as suffering, the higher beings see quite clearly withtheir superior wisdom as blissful.’These are the two points; grasp them together and, with energy, dedication andcare, you can expect one of those two results.36 Whatever there is which is said to be existent, the delightful, enticing andpleasant forms, sounds, tastes, odours, tactile sensations and thoughts, theseare all agreed upon by the world, inclusive of its gods, to be happiness.(759)37 In your world these things are thought of as pleasures, and yet, when theycease, they are thought of as sufferings.(760)38 To the higher beings when the individual body and personality comes to an endit is considered to be blissful. But this varies sharply from the way it is seenby the rest of the common world.(761)39 What is generally called blissful is called suffering by men of worth. Andwhat is generally called suffering is known to be blissful by them.(762)Be aware of this paradox: it is difficult to understand and the ignorant are inerror in this regard.40 It is dark where they are trapped; it is pitch dark for the blind and crystalclear for the wholesome; for those that can see it there is light.But if you are blind to the Teachings of the Way Things Are, if you know nothingof the path, then you will not be able to make out anything though you may beright on top of it.(763)41 This Teaching about the Way Things Are does not become a force of fullenlightenment for someone who is infected with desire, yearning to be, or forsomeome who is in the grip of Māra.(764)42 For who else can justifiably reach this state of full understanding exceptfor those beings of distinction? Who else has come to understand this state anddispersed all the forces of confusion?’(765)This is what the Buddha said on that occasion. The monks were full of gladnessand joy when they heard these things. Indeed, some sixty monks let go of allclinging and grasping during this talk and they were freed."},{"pageContent":"IV. The Chapter of the Eights [part0003.html#c4]1. Kāma Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_1]Sensual pleasure — to be avoided [part0006.html#s4_1]1 If he who desires sensual pleasures is successful, he will certainly begratified, having obtained what a mortal wishes for.(766)2 But if those sensual pleasures are denied to the person who desires and wishesfor them, he will suffer as one pierced with darts.(767)3 He who avoids sensual pleasures as he would avoid crushing the head of a snakewith his foot, such a one, being thoughtful, will conquer this desire.(768)4–5 He who desires different sense objects, such as estates, gardens, gold,money, horses, servants, relations, passions will overpower him, dangers willcrush him and pain will follow him as water leaks into a wrecked ship.(769 – 70)6 Therefore, let one always be thoughtful and avoid sensual pleasures; havingabandoned them let him cross the flood [of defilements] and, like baling out adamaged ship, go to the further shore [Nibbāna].(771)2. Guhaṭṭaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_2]The Cave [part0006.html#s4_2]1 That man who is greatly attached to the cave of the body and sunk in delusion,such a one is far from detachment.1 [part0010.html#en-4a_1] Sensual pleasuresare not easy to abandon in the world.(772)2 Those who are bound to worldly pleasures, conditioned by craving, aredifficult to liberate; they cannot be liberated by others. Perceiving their pastand future indulgence they hanker after sensuality.(773)3 Those who are greedy, engage in and are infatuated by sensual pleasures; whoremain stingy in a miserable state, wail: ‘What will happen to us after death?’(774)4 Therefore a person should train himself in the immediate present. If he knowsthat the world is wicked, he should not take the wicked way. Life is short, saythe wise.(775)5 I observe these trembling beings of the world given to desire for variousstates of becoming; they are wrecked who cringe at death, not being free fromcraving for repeated birth.(776)6 Look at those who struggle after their petty ambitions, like fish in a streamthat is fast drying up. Seeing this, let one fare unselfish in this life, whileceasing to worry about various states of becoming.(777)7 Overcoming desire alike for sensory enjoyment and their causes, comprehendingsense impressions, not hankering after enjoyments and not doing what is againstone’s conscience, the wise one does not get attached to what he sees or hears.(778)8 Having realized the [nature of] ideas, the sage is not attached to worldlyobjects. Having pulled out the dart of passion and faring heedfully, he does notcrave for this world or the next.(779)Note1 [part0010.html#en4a_1] Detachment is threefold, viz. (i) bodily detachment (kāyavịveka), (ii) mentaldetachment (cittaviveka) and (iii) psycho-ethical detachment (upadhiviveka).Niddesa I. 26f.3. Duṭṭhaṭṭhaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_3]Corruption [part0006.html#s4_3]1 Some people speak with malicious intentions and others with the convictionthat they are right. But the sage does not enter into any controversy that hasarisen. Therefore, the sage is free from all mental obstruction.(780)2 The person who is led by his impelling desire and continues according to hisinclination, finds it difficult to give up those views he adheres to. Coming toconclusions of his own, he speaks in accordance with his knowledge.(781)3 If a person, without being asked, praises his own virtue and practices toothers, or talks of himself, the good say he is ignoble.(782)4 The calm, disciplined one who abstains from praising himself for his virtues,declaring, ‘So I am’, the good call him a noble. In him there is no arroganceconcerning the world.(783)5 He whose views are mentally constructed, causally formed, highly esteemed butnot pure; views in which he sees personal advantage, will experience a calmwhich is unstable.(784)6 It is hard to go beyond preconceived ideas reached by passing judgmentregarding doctrines. Therefore, with regard to these views he rejects one andgrasps another.(785)7 For the person with spiritual excellence, nowhere in the world does he haveany mentally-constructed view about various spheres of becoming. As he haseradicated delusion and deceit, in what manner can he be reckoned? He cannot bereckoned in any manner whatsoever.(786)8 He who is attached enters into debate about doctrines. By what and how can anunattached person be characterized? He has nothing to grasp or reject; he haspurified all views here itself.(787)4. Suddhaṭṭhaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_4]Purity [part0006.html#s4_4]1 ‘I see a pure, noble and healthy man; a person’s purification emerges fromwhat he sees’ — thus, holding this opinion and having seen this view to be thebest, he considers knowledge to consist in the seeing of a pure being.(788)2 If a man’s purity comes from what is seen, or if by this knowledge he can befreed of sorrow, then something other than the Noble Path makes the persongrasping after things a pure one. This view itself reveals the nature of thisperson.(789)3 No brahmin claims purity from an external source such as what is seen, heard,or cognized, or from rule or rite. Unsullied by both merit and demerit he hasdiscarded the ego; he does not commit here any action productive of (rebecoming)results.(790)4 Those who leave one thing to take up another and follow attachment neverrelinquish desire. They are like monkeys who let go of one branch to graspanother, only to let it go again.(791)5 The man who, having undertaken certain holy practices himself, attached toideas, passes from superior to inferior states. But the wise man, havingunderstood the Truth by the [supreme] means of knowledge does not pass fromsuperior to inferior states.(792)6 He who has dissociated himself from whatever is seen, heard or cognized. Howcan one have doubts about such an insightful person who conducts himself openly?(793)7 They do not speculate, they do not esteem any views and say ‘This is thehighest purity’. They release the knot of dogmatic clinging and do not long foranything in the world.(794)8 The brahmin who has transcended the limits of mundane existence; he has nograsping after knowing or seeing. He delights neither in passion nor indispassion. For him there is nothing here to be grasped as the highest.(795)5. Paramaṭṭhaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_5]Perfection [part0006.html#s4_5]1 The person abiding by a certain dogmatic view, considering it is the highestin the world, claims ‘This is the most excellent’, and disparages other viewsdifferent from that as inferior. As a result, he is not free from disputes.(796)2 When he sees personal advantages from the things that he has seen, heard orcognized, or from rule or rite, he clings passionately to that alone and seeseverything else as inferior.(797)3 The experts say that it is a bond to depend on what one associates with and tosee everything else as inferior. Therefore, the disciplined one should not trustin things seen, heard or felt or in rules and rites.(798)4 A disciplined man does not engender dogmatic views in the world either byknowledge or by rule or rite. Therefore, he does not consider himself‘superior’, ‘inferior’ or ‘equal’.(799)5 The sage has abandoned the notion of self or ego and is free from clinging. Hedoes not depend even on knowledge; he does not take sides in the midst ofcontroversy; he has no dogmatic views.(800)6 For him there is no desire to strive for this or that, in this world or thenext. He has ceased to associate with dogmas for he no longer requires thesolace that dogmas offer.(801)7 To the sage there is not the slightest prejudiced view with regard to thingsseen, heard or felt. How can anyone in the world characterize by thought such apure one who does not dogmatically grasp any views?(802)8 They neither form any particular dogma nor prefer anything. Dogmatic views arenot esteemed by them. The brahmin is not led by rule and rite. Thus, thesteadfast one has gone to the further shore, never more to return.(803)6. Jarā Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_6]Decay [part0006.html#s4_6]1 Short indeed is this life; one dies within a hundred years, but if anyonesurvives longer than that he surely dies of decay.(804)2 People grieve for the things they are attached to as ‘mine’, but there is noenduring object of grasping. Comprehending this situation, the wise one shouldlead a homeless life.(805)3 What one grasps thinking, ‘this is mine’, is left behind by death. Recognizingthis fact, let not the wise one who follows the right path turn toacquisitiveness.(806)4 The awakened man does not see what he has dreamt in sleep; likewise one doesnot see the beloved that has passed away and is dead.(807)5 Seen and heard are those people whose particular names are mentioned; but onlythe name of a person remains when he has passed away.(808)6 The selfish, greedy ones do not give up sorrow, lamentation and miserliness.Hence, the sages, giving up objects of grasping, wander about with insight intotranquillity.(809)7 For the disciplined one who leads a contemplative life and cultivates a mindof seclusion, it is to be expected that he will not continue in existence.(810)8 The sage who is independent in all circumstances, does not exhibit like ordislike. Sorrow and avarice do not cling to him as water does not stick to thelotus leaf.(811)9 As a drop of water does not stick to a lotus leaf or as a lotus flower isuntainted by the water, so the sage does not cling to anything — seen, heard orthought.(812)10 The liberated one does not seek anything that is seen, heard or thought. Hedoes not seek purity through anything else for he has neither passion nordispassion.(813)7. Tissametteyya Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_7]Tissametteyya [part0006.html#s4_7]In praise of celibacyTissametteyya:1 Tell me, O gracious Sir, the mishaps for him who is given to sexualintercourse. By learning your admonition we will train ourselves in seclusion.(814)The Buddha:2 Both learning and the practice of the Teaching are lost to him who is given tosexual intercourse. He employs himself wrongly. That is what is ignoble in him.(815)3 He who formerly fared alone but is now given to sexual intercourse, they callthat uncontrolled one a low and ordinary being who is like a lurching chariot.(816)4 What fame and renown he had before is lost to him. Having seen this, he shouldtrain to give up sexual intercourse.(817)5 He who is overcome by thoughts, broods thereon like a miserable fellow and,having heard the reproach of others, he becomes depressed.(818)6 Tormented by the words of others, he injures his life by wrongdoing. Hebecomes attached and plunges into falsehood.(819)7 First they thought him ‘a wise one’ when he took up the solitary life, butsince he has given himself up to sexual intercourse, they call him ‘a fool’.(820)8 Realizing this danger in the world from beginning to the end, the sage keepsstrictly to his solitary life. He does not give himself up to sexualintercourse.(821)9 Let him train in the solitary life, for that is the noble life. Because ofthat he should not think himself the best. He, truly, is the person who is atthe threshold of liberation [Nibbāna].(822)10 The tranquil and solitary sage remains free from sensual desires and hascrossed the stream of such tendencies. He is indeed envied by those attached tocarnal bonds.(823)8. Pasūra Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_8]Disputation — and its futility [part0006.html#s4_8]1 They say that purity is theirs alone; they do not say that there is purity inthe teachings of others. Whatever teaching they have devoted themselves to, theyclaim that as the most excellent and thus separately hold diverse truths.(824)2 The debaters, having entered into the gathering, start disputes calling eachother fools; since they are depending on certain teachers, they seek praise,calling themselves the experts.(825)3 Engaged in disputations in the midst of a gathering, one becomes frustrated inone’s quest for praise. In defeat he becomes downcast and, seeking for flaws inothers, becomes enraged by their criticism.(826)4 When those who have tested his questions say that his talk is faulty, helaments, grieves and wails in his worthless disputes saying, They have defeatedme!’(827)5 These disputes arise among recluses and as a result of them there is elationand depression. Seeing this, avoid disputation. There is no value in it otherthan the praise won thereby.(828)6 He who is praised in the midst of a gathering for having successfully defendedhis view, will be thrilled with joy and be much elated in mind for having wonhis case.(829)7 Elation itself is the ground of his downfall; for still he talks with prideand arrogance. Seeing this, one should not dispute; for the wise never say thatpurification is achieved thereby.(830)8 Like the bold one nourished by good food, he goes forth roaring looking for arival. Wherever there is such a rival you may go there. But here, there isnothing left as before which could provoke a fight.(831)9 Those who have embraced a certain theory and argue over it maintaining thatthat alone is the truth, you may talk with such people. But here, ‘there is noopponent to battle with you’.(832)10 Those who fare on, having overcome opposition without countering any onetheory with another, what would you obtain, O bold one, from them? For themthere is nothing embraced as the highest.(833)11 Speculating in your mind on different philosophical views, you have comereflecting on them. But you cannot go along yoked together with the one who ispurified.(834)9. Māgandiya Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_9]Māgandiya [part0006.html#s4_9](Similar to the preceding Sutta)(The dialogue between Māgandiya and the Buddha on the occasion of the former’soffer of his daughter as a wife to the Buddha.)1 The Buddha: ‘Even seeing (Māra’s daughters1 [part0010.html#en-4i_1]) — Taṇhā(craving) Rati (attachment) and Ragā (passion) — there was not the least arisingof carnal desire in me for intercourse. What is this thing full of urine andexcrement? I would not like even to touch it with my foot!(835)2 Māgandiya: If you do not want such a jewel, a maiden desired by many kings,tell me what is your view, what is your way of life in accordance with virtueand practice, and your future destiny.(836)3 The Buddha: O Māgandiya, after studying what men hold fast to, I do not say‘This I declare’. Seeing all these views, but not grasping them and searchingfor the truth, I found inward peace.(837)4 Māgandiya: Noble sage, without grasping those judgments incorporated in thespeculative systems, you talk of inward peace. How is it described by the wise?(838)5 The Buddha: I do not say one attains ‘purification’ by view, tradition,knowledge, virtue or ritual, nor is it attained without view, tradition,knowledge, virtue or ritual. It is only taking these factors as the means andnot grasping them as ends in themselves that one so attains and consequentlydoes not crave for rebecoming.(839)6 Māgandiya: If you do not say that ‘purification’ is not attained by view,tradition, knowledge and ritual nor by absence of these — it seems to me thatyour lore is a nonsense, because some deem ‘purification’ is from view.(840)7 The Buddha: Because of your view you are continually asking these questions.It is because you are obsessed with your preconceived notions that you areholding fast. From this you have not perceived the least sense: that is why yousee this as nonsense.(841)8 He who thinks himself ‘equal’, ‘inferior’ or ‘superior’ to others, by thatvery reason enters disputation. But there are not such thoughts ‘equal’,‘inferior’ or ‘superior’ to him who is unmoved by these three measurements.(842)9 Why should the arahant argue with whom he contends saying ‘This is a truth’ or‘That is a lie’? If one has no such thoughts ‘equal’ or ‘unequal’, with whomshould he enter into dispute?(843)10 The sage who has forsaken his home, not entering upon intimate relations invillages, free from lust, not giving preference [to mundane desire] — he doesnot engage in disputatious talk with people.(844)11 The noble one who wanders in the world, liberated from views, does not graspthem and enter into arguments. As the thorny lotus rises on its stalk unsoiledby mud and water, so the sage, speaker of peace and free from desire, isunsoiled by the world and its carnal pleasures.(845)12 That wise one does not become conceited through views or knowledge, for he isnot attached to that sort. He is neither enticed by action nor by learning,being detached in every circumstance.(846)13 There are no ties to him who is free from ideas, there are no delusions tohim who is delivered by wisdom. Those who grasp ideas and views, wander aboutcoming into conflict in the world.(847)Note1 [part0010.html#en4i_1]Synonymous with tempting thoughts.10. Purābheda Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_10]Qualities of a Muni [part0006.html#s4_10]1 ‘Gotama, sir,’ a questioner said to the Buddha, ‘I want to ask you about theperfect man. There are those people whom we call “men who are calmed” — can youtell me how they see things and how they behave?’(848)2 ‘A man who is calmed, who has extinguished all his cravings before the timehis body disintegrates into nothing, who has no concern with how things began orwith how they will end and no fixation with what happens in between: such a manhas no preferences.(849)3 He has no anger, no fear and no pride. Nothing disturbs his composure andnothing gives him cause for regret. He is the wise man who is restrained inspeech.(850)4 He has no longing for the future and no grief for the past; there are no viewsor opinions that lead him. He can see detachment from the entangled world ofsense-impression.(851)5 He does not conceal anything and there is nothing he holds on to. Withoutacquisitiveness or envy, he remains unobtrusive; he has no disdain or insult foranyone.(852)6 He is not a man who is full of himself, or a man who is addicted to pleasure;he is a man who is gentle and alert, with no blind faith; he shows no aversion[to anything].(853)7 He is not a person who works because he wants something; if he gets nothing atall he remains unperturbed. There is no craving to build up the passion to tastenew pleasures.(854)8 His mindfulness holds him posed in a constant even-mindedness where arroganceis impossible; he makes no comparisons with the rest of the world as “superior”,“inferior” or “equal”.(855)9 Because he understands the Way Things Are, he is free from dependency andthere is nothing he relies on. For him there is no more craving to exist or notto exist.(856)10 This is what I call a man who is calmed. It is a man who does not seek afterpleasure, who has nothing to tie him down, who has gone beyond the pull ofattachment.(857)11 It is a man without sons, a man without wealth, without fields, without cows— a man with nothing in him that he grasps at as his and nothing in him that herejects as not his.(858)12 He is a man who receives false criticisms from other people, from priests andhermits but who remains undisturbed and unmoved by their words.(859)13 It is a man without greed and without possessiveness; it is a man who, as aman of wisdom, does not consider himself “superior”, “inferior” or “equal”. Itis a man who does not enter speculation a man who is free from speculations.(860)14 It is a man who has nothing in this world that he calls his own and who doesnot grieve for not having anything. He is calmed who does not take speculativeviews.’(861)11. Kalahavivāda Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_11]Disputes and Contention [part0006.html#s4_11](The causes of anger and attachment)1 ‘Sir’, said a questioner, ‘whenever there are arguments and quarrels there aretears and anguish, arrogance and pride and grudges and insults to go with them.Can you explain how these things come about? Where do they all come from?’(862)2 ‘The tears and anguish that follow arguments and quarrels’, said the Buddha,‘the arrogance and pride and the grudges and insults that go with them are allthe result of one thing. They come from having preferences, from holding thingsprecious and dear. Insults are born out of arguments and grudges are inseparablefrom quarrels.’(863)3 ‘But why, Sir, do we have these preferences, these special things? Why do wehave so much greed? And all the aspirations and achievements that we base ourlives on, where do we get them from?’(864)4 ‘The preferences, the precious things’, said the Buddha, ‘come from theimpulse of desire. So too does the greed and so too do the aspirations andachievements that make up people’s lives’.(865)5 ‘From where, Sir, comes this impulse of desire? From where do we derive ourtheories and opinions? And what about all the other things that you, theWanderer, have named — such as anger, dishonesty and confusion?’(866)6 ‘The impulse of desire arises when people think of one thing as pleasant andanother as unpleasant: that is the source of desire. It is when people see thatmaterial things are subject both to becoming and to disintegration that theyform their theories about the world.(867)7 Anger, confusion and dishonesty arise when things are set in pairs asopposites. The person with perplexity must train himself in the path ofknowledge. The recluse has declared the Truth after realization.’(868)8 ‘But why, Sir, is it that we find some things pleasant and some unpleasant?What could we do to stop that? And this idea of becoming and disintegration,could you explain where that comes from?’(869)9 ‘It is the action of contact, of mental impression, that leads to the feelingsof pleasant and unpleasant. Without the contact they would not exist. And, as Isee it, the idea of becoming and disintegration also comes from this source,from the action of contact.’(870)10 ‘So what, Sir, does this contact come from? And the grasping habit, what’sthe reason for that? Is there anything that can be done to get rid ofpossessiveness and anything that could be eliminated so that there would be nomore contact?’(871)11 ‘Contact exists because the compound of mind and matter exists. The habit ofgrasping is based on wanting things. If there were no wanting, there would be nopossessiveness. Similarly, without the element of form, of matter, there wouldbe no contact.’(872)12 ‘What pursuit leads a person to get rid of form? And how can suffering andpleasure cease to exist? This is what I want to know about.’(873)13 ‘There is a state where form ceases to exist’, said the Buddha. ‘It is astate without ordinary perception and without disordered perception and withoutno perception and without any annihilation of perception. It is perception,consciousness, that is the source of all the basic obstacles.’(874)14 ‘Sir, you have explained to us everything we have asked you about. There isone more question we would like you to answer for us: Do the learned scholars ofthe world say that this is the highest purification of the individual being ordo they say that there is some other kind of goal?’(875)15 ‘There are scholars and authorities’, replied the Buddha, ‘who say that thisis the highest and the purification of the individual. There are others whomaintain that the highest purity is to be found in the complete eradication ofthe five components of the person.(876)16 And there is also the muni, the wise man. He has realized which things aredependencies and he knows that these are only crutches and props. And when hehas realized this, he has become free. He does not enter into arguments and sodoes not enter the round of endless becomings.’(877)12. Cūlaviyūha Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_12]Minor Causes of Contention [part0006.html#s4_12]1 Questioner: Some who abide strictly to their own views alone, come intodispute with others, each claiming that they themselves are the only experts,declaring thus: ‘One who understands this, knows the Truth; whoever rejects thisis imperfect.’(878)2 So, having thus got into arguments, they dispute (amongst themselves). Theysay ‘the other person is a fool not an expert’. Since one and all are experttalkers, which is the true statement out of these?(879)3 The Buddha: If one who does not tolerate another’s view is a fool, a dolt andstupid, then all of them are fools without understanding, because all of themabide by their [own] views only.(880)4 If by reason of one’s view one becomes pure, pure in wisdom, expert andintelligent — then there is none among them who is of inferior wisdom, for theyhave all equally arrived at [dogmatic] views.(881)5 I do not say that whatever the fools separately advocate is true. They maketheir own individual views true. Therefore, they determine that another personis a fool.(882)6 Questioner: What some say is true and real, others say is empty and false.Thus they come to conflict and debate. Why do the recluses not propound onedoctrine?(883)7 The Buddha: The truth is indeed one and the knower of it does not dispute it.There is not a second [view]. Because diverse truths are proclaimed, theascetics do not say one and the same.(884)8 Questioner: Why do the disputants who assert themselves to be the expertsproclaim ‘truths’ so diverse? Are there in reality diverse truths or are theyfollowing their own reasoning?(885)9 The Buddha: There are not many diverse truths in the world except those whichare surmised by [faulty] perception. Assuming mere sophistry in their views,they claim a duality — ‘This is true and that is false.’(886)10 The fool depends on what is seen, heard or cognized, and rule or rite andlooks down upon others saying ‘The other person is a fool, an imperfect one’.making his own judgment and being happy with it.(887)11 Just because one who thinks another is a fool and therefore calls himself anexpert, such a person who calls himself an expert insults himself and others.(888)12 The one who is full of rigid, fixed views, puffed up with pride andarrogance, who deems himself ‘perfect’, becomes annointed in his own opinionbecause he holds firmly to his own view.(889)13 If one becomes low by another’s word, one becomes one of low wisdom alongwith the other. And if on one’s own one becomes learned and wise then there isnone among recluses who is a fool.(890)14 ‘Those who proclaim a doctrinal view different from this have misunderstood.’Thus the heretics proclaim many diverse views because they are attached to theirown views.(891)15 Those who are attached to their [own] views maintain that purity [of view] iswith them and they deny purity [of view] in other doctrines. Thus these hereticsare deeply attached to their own views.(892)16 The heretic who maintains firmly that his own view is right, who else wouldhe brand a fool? He who calls others ‘fool’ and ‘holder of impure doctrine’would indeed invite strife.(893)17 Standing rigidly to his own view and depending on his own criteria, he entersinto dispute in the world. Desisting from all theories the wise one does notenter into dispute in the world.(894)13. Mahāviyūha Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_13]Major Causes of Contention [part0006.html#s4_13]1 Those who, adhering to their views, dispute ‘this only is the truth’, eitherbring blame upon themselves or obtain praise thereby.(895)2 The result of the praise is trifling and not enough to bring abouttranquillity. I say there are two results of dispute [victory or defeat]; havingseen this, let no one dispute, realizing Nibbāna where there is no dispute.(896)3 The wise one does not embrace all those views that have arisen amongst worldlypeople. Should he who is free from views be pleased with what has been seen andheard and remain dependent on them?(897)4 Those who consider moral practices to be the highest say: ‘purity comesthrough restraint; having undertaken a holy practice, let us train in it whencepurity comes.’ But those so-called experts are still immersed in Saṃsāra.(898)5 If he falls away from moral conduct and holy practices, he trembles, havingfailed in his action; he longs here for purity like a traveller who has lost hiscaravan while he is away from his home.(899)6 Having abandoned formal religious practices altogether and actions both ‘good’and ‘bad’, neither longing for ‘purity’ nor ‘impurity’, he wanders aloofabstaining from both without adhering to either extreme.(900)7 Practising loathsome penances or adhering to what has been seen, heard orthought, they praise purity in high voices — but they are not free from cravingfor recurring existence.(901)8 For him who desires, more desires result; he trembles, deluded by imaginaryviews. For him who has overcome death and birth why should he tremble and whatwould he yearn for?(902)9 What some regard as the highest view others consider to be worthless. They allclaim to be experts: which of them indeed is right?(903)10 Each one claims that his own view is perfect and that the belief of others isinferior. Thus they enter into dispute; thus each of them says that his ownopinion is true.(904)11 If a view becomes worthless because it is censured by others, then no onewill be distinguished because each one firmly regards another’s view as lowwhilst one’s own alone is regarded as true.(905)12 Just as they honour their views, likewise they praise their ways. If alltheir views are true then their purity must also be peculiar to them.(906)13 To the noble one there is no lead from others, nothing to embrace afterinvestigation of views; he, therefore, has transcended disputation, for he doesnot see another’s view as the best.(907)14 ‘I know and see, this is just so’ — thus saying, some claim purity throughthat view. What is the point in saying that one has ‘seen’ (the truth) if rivalviews are put forward.(908)15 The man sees mind and matter and having seen he takes them as permanent. Lethim see either much or little for experts do not say: ‘purity comes by that’.(909)16 Not easy to discipline the dogmatist who says this is the truth, beingmisguided by views. Saying that good is in such preconceptions, he is given tosaying that purity is inherent as he has so seen.(910)17 The noble one having perceived things through knowledge, does not enter intospeculations. Having learnt of diverse theories that have arisen among others,he is indifferent to them whilst others labour to embrace them.(911)18 The sage, being freed from worldly ties, remains peaceful among the restless.He is indifferent among sectarian squabbles, not embracing them whilst othersremain attached.(912)19 Having abandoned former defilements, not inducing new ones, not becomingpartisan, he is free from dogmatic views. Being wise, he neither clings to theworld nor blames himself.(911)20 By overcoming all the theories based on seen, heard or thought he is a sagewho has released his burden and is liberated, not imaginative in views, notaspiring for anything — so said the Buddha.(914)14. Tuvaṭaka Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_14]The Way to Bliss [part0006.html#s4_14](A portrayal of the ideal monk)1 ‘Master of Wisdom, descendant of the Sun’, said a questioner to the Buddha, ‘Iwish to question you about the state of peace, the state of solitude and quietdetachment. With what manner of insight does a monk become calm, cooled and nolonger grasps at anything?’(915)2 ‘He achieves this’, replied the Master, ‘by cutting out the root obstacle, thedelusion: he eradicates all thought of “I am”. By being mindful all the time hetrains himself to let go of all the cravings that arise in him.(916)3 Whatever he may understand inwardly or outwardly, he has to avoid becomingproud of his convictions. For good men have said that this is not the state ofcalm.(917)4 He has to avoid thinking of himself as better or worse than, or equal toanyone. Coming into contact with various things, he should not embellish theself.(918)5 The monk must look for peace within himself and not in any other place. Forwhen a person is inwardly quiet, there is nowhere a self can be found; where,then, could a non-self be found?(919)6 There are no waves in the depths of the sea; it is still, unbroken. It is thesame with the monk. He is still, without any quiver of desire, without a remnanton which to build pride and desire.’(920)7 ‘Sir’, said the questioner, ‘you have explained with clear words and with openeyes the way that removes all dangers. Could you please tell me now about thepractices of the path, the rules that must be kept and also about thedevelopment of concentration?’(921)8 ‘The Master replied: ‘A monk keeps his eyes from wandering restlessly withdesire and his ears are deaf to chatter and gossip. He has no longing for newsweets to taste; nor has he any desire to possess things in the world as hisown.(922)9 Where he is in contact with sense impressions he should not become sorrowfulor sad. He should not begin to wish for some other kind of life or tremble whenconfronted with fearful things.(923)10 When he is given rice and other food to eat, or milk to drink, or clothes towear, then, as a monk, he should not begin to store them up. And he should notbe anxious if he does not get any of them.(924)11 He has to become a man of meditation, not a loiterer, and a man without anyregrets or laziness. He is a monk, and, sitting or lying down, he spends histime in his quiet living-place.(925)12 He should not sleep too much and he should make constant effort to bewatchful whilst he is awake. Laziness, deception, laughter, games, sexualintercourse, ornaments: all these he has to give up.(926)13 He does not study the practice of magic and spells. He does not analysedreams and signs in sleep and movements in the Zodiac. As one of my followers,he should not spend time interpreting bird-songs or curing infertility orselling medicines and cures.(927)14 The monk should not be perturbed by criticism or impressed by praise. Thereis no place for greed in him; hoarding, anger and slander are emotions he has todiscard.(928)15 He should not get involved in buying and selling, and he should learn not toblame anything on other people. When he meets people in the village he must notspeak to them in the hope of getting some reward.(929)16 He should not boast, should not speak carelessly, should not train himself inimpudence or utter quarrelsome talk.(930)17 The monk should not speak falsehood. He should not wilfully commit dishonestdeeds. He should not look down upon another, feeling proud of his livelihood,wisdom or observance of rule and rite.(931)18 And when he hears other wanderers and ordinary people using angry words, hedoes not retort with harsh speech; for men of goodness do not answer back.(932)19 Understanding this norm, the inquiring monk should train himself beingconstantly mindful. When the realization comes that peace can be found in thestate of calm, then he should apply himself completely to the teaching ofGotama.(933)20 He is the undefeated conqueror: he saw with his own eyes the Way Things Are;he did not borrow it from tradition. So, with constant diligence and respect,the monk should apply himself to the teaching of this Master.’(934)15. Attadaṇḍa Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_15]Violent Conduct [part0006.html#s4_15](A portrayal of perfect freedom similar to the preceding Sutta)1 Fear results from resorting to violence — just look at how people quarrel andfight! But let me tell you now of the kind of dismay and terror that I havefelt.(935)2 Seeing people struggling, like fish, writhing in shallow water with enmityagainst one another, I became afraid.(936)3 At one time, I had wanted to find some place where I could take shelter, but Inever saw any such place. There is nothing in this world that is solid at baseand not a part of it that is changeless.(937)4 I had seen them all trapped in mutual conflict and that is why I had felt sorepelled. But then I noticed something buried deep in their hearts. It was — Icould just make it out — a dart.(938)5 It is a dart that makes its victims run all over the place. But once it hasbeen pulled out all that running is finished and so is the exhaustion that comeswith it.(939)6 These are the things we can learn from this: The bonds of the world should notbe pursued. Disenchanted with all sense pleasures one should train oneself incalmness [Nibbāna].(940)7 A man of wisdom should be truthful, without arrogance, without deceit, notslanderous and not hateful. He should go beyond the evil of greed andmiserliness.(941)8 To have your mind set on calmness, you must take power over sleepiness,drowsiness and lethargy. There is no place for laziness and no recourse topride.(942)9 Do not be led into lying, do not be attached to forms. You must see throughall pride and fare along without violence.(943)10 Do not get excited by what is old, do not be contented with what is new. Donot grieve for what is lost or be controlled by desire.(944)11 I call this craving, the greed, a great flood, and the hankering I callattachment, hanging up. This bog of lust is difficult to cross.(945)12 But the man of wisdom stands on solid ground — he is like a brahmin, nevermoving from Truth, and when he has completely renounced then indeed is he calm.(946)13 He has wisdom, he has complete knowledge, he has understood the Way ThingsAre. He is completely independent. In his perfect wanderings from place toplace, he has no envy for anyone.(947)14 Desire is a chain, shackled to the world, and it is a difficult one to break.But once that is done, there is no more grief and no more longing: the streamhas been cut off and there are no more chains.(948)15 Let there be nothing behind you; leave the future to one side. Do not clutchat what is left in the middle; then you will become a wanderer and calm.(949)16 When a man does not identify himself with mind and matter at all, when hedoes not grieve for what does not exist, then he cannot sustain any loss in thisworld.(950)17 When he does not think, This is mine’ or That belongs to them’, then, sincehe has no egoism, he cannot grieve with the thought of ‘I do not have’.(951)18 If you ask me to describe a man who is unshakeable, I say that where there isno harshness, where there is no greed, no trace of desire, and when a man is thesame in all circumstances, then you have what I would call the praiseworthycondition of a man unshakeable.(952)19 A man of discernment, without a flutter of desire, does not accumulate — hehas no conditioning — he has stopped all effort of every kind; so everywhere hesees peace and happiness.(953)20 The wise man does not rate himself with the distinguished, the lowest, norwith ordinary people; calm and unselfish, he is free from possessiveness: heholds on to nothing and he rejects nothing.(954)16. Sāriputta Sutta [part0006.html#sec4_16]Sāriputta [part0006.html#s4_16]The training practice of a monkVenerable Sāriputta said:1 Neither have I seen, nor has anyone heard of such a sweet-tongued Mastercoming down from the Tusita heaven to the midst of the many.(955)2 The one with vision appears as he really is to the world of men and gods andafter having dispelled all darkness he alone attained happiness.(956)3 Here, from the many, I have come supplicatingly, with a question for theBuddha who is unattached, a guileless teacher who has arrived in the world.(957)4 –5 The monk who abhors the world will seek out a lonely lodging under trees,in mountain caves; to him who delights in these various lodgings what dangersare there? The monk does not tremble in his quiet dwelling. (958 – 9)6 How many dangers are there in the world to be overcome by a monk living insolitary dwellings and going towards the region of immortality?(960)7 What are his words, what are his objects in this world, what are the virtuesand practices of the energetic monk?(961)8 What is the training he has to undertake so that, being concentrated, wise andmindful, he may remove his own impurities as a smith removes the dross fromsilver?(962)The Buddha said:9 O Sāriputta, to you who are disgusted with the world, who delight in asolitary dwelling, and desire perfect enlightenment in accordance with theTruth, I will tell what I have realized.(963)10 The monk who is wise, mindful and who wanders in the limitations,1[part0010.html#en-4p_1] is not afraid of the five dangers, [viz.] gadflies andall other flies, snakes, men of ill-will or animals.(964)11 He is not afraid of heretics, even when he has seen the dangers from them.Furthermore, he who is a seeker of good, will overcome other dangers too.(965)12 He endures cold and excessive heat, even if he is affected by sickness andhunger. Affected by them in many ways, and being homeless, make strongexertions!(966)13 Let him not steal, let him not speak lies, let him touch with loving-kindnessthose who are feeble or strong. When he is aware that his mind is agitated letthat agitation be driven away by knowing that it belongs to the baser side.(967)14 Let him not fall under the influence of anger or arrogance; let him stay byhaving uprooted these and let him overcome both what is pleasant and what isunpleasant.(968)15 Guided by wisdom, with noble joy, overcoming dangers, let him dispeldiscontent in his distant solitude. Let him overcome the four lamentations:(969)16 ‘What shall I eat, or where shall I eat? I slept [last night] uncomfortablyindeed; where shall 1 sleep tonight?’ Let the aspirant who wanders abouthomeless subdue these lamentable thoughts.(970)17 Having received in due time both food and robes, he knows moderation inworldly matters for the sake of contentment. Guarded in these things andrestrained while wandering in the village, even if he is offended by people henever utters a harsh word.(971)18 He who walks about with downcast eyes, not loitering, devoted to meditation,should be very watchful. Having acquired equanimity with a composed mind heshould cut off base and discursive thoughts and remorse.(972)19 Let him welcome the words of reproof mindfully. With words of reproach lethim break stubbornness in his fellow monks. Let him utter wise words at a propertime. Let him not think detractingly of vulgar people.(973)20 Then let him mindfully train to discipline the five kinds of pollution in theworld, [namely] passion for forms, sounds, tastes, smells and touch.(974)21 Let the monk who is mindful with well-liberated mind subdue the desire forthese things. Then, investigating the Truth thoroughly and with concentration,he will destroy the darkness [of ignorance].(975)Note1 [part0010.html#en4p_1]The four limitations (pariyanta) are moralself-restraint (sīlasaṃvara), restraint of the senses (indriyasamvara),moderation in food (bhojanamattaññutā) and the applications of watchfulness(Jāgiriyānuyoga)."},{"pageContent":"V. The Chapter of the Way to the Beyond [part0003.html#c5]Vatthugāthā [part0006.html#sec5_1](Prologue) [part0006.html#s5_1]1 One day a man walked out of the beautiful city of Sāvatthi in Kosala. It wasBāvari the brahmin, one versed in the Vedic mantras. He had set out on thesouthern road in search of detachment.(976)2 He travelled till he came to the land of the Assakas and there, where it meetsthe Aḷaka’s land, on the banks of the River Godhāvari, he stayed, living offfruit and whatever else he could gather.(977)3 One day, begging in a rich village nearby, he was given such a quantity ofgifts that he was able to hold a great offering-ceremony.(978)4 He had just finished the rituals and got back to his hut when another brahminarrived at the door.(979)5 He was thirsty, covered with dust, with stains on his teeth and swellings onhis feet. He came up to the hermit and begged to be given 500 pence worth ofmoney.(980)6 As soon as the hermit saw the visitor he made him sit down. After he had askedafter his health and happiness he told the man he couldn’t help.(981)7 ‘You see, brahmin, I’ve given away everything I’ve been given. Please forgiveme, but I haven’t got 500 pence 1(982)8 ‘You have rejected the pleading of a beggar!’ said the visitor. May your headsplit into seven in seven days’ time as a result of this refusal!’(983)9 And then, before he left, the rascal chanted spells and laid a formal curse onBāvari, to the brahmin’s great distress.(984)10 In the days that followed the brahmin’s pain increased. The sadness and griefwere like darts in his side; he couldn’t eat, he just wasted away; he couldn’teven settle his mind in meditation.(985)11 But a friendly goddess-spirit saw him in his suffering and fear, and so shecame to his hut and talked to him.(986)12 ‘He was only an imposter, that man’, she said, ‘trying to make easy money.Besides he was ignorant — he knows nothing about the head and nothing abouthead-splitting.’(987)13 ‘Goddess’, said the brahmin, ‘if he doesn’t know, then who does? If youunderstand head-splitting then please tell me all about it. I have to understandit!’(988)14 ‘No’, said the spirit, ‘I can’t help you, I don’t know a thing about it. Theonly people who can know about things like that are Conquerors.’(989)15 ‘Well then, goddess’, said the brahmin, ‘you must tell me who in the world Ican go to who’ll know.’(990)16 And this is how the goddess replied:‘In the line of the great King Okkaka a boy has been born to the Sākyas. He hasgone out of their capital Kapilavatthu; he has gone into the world as a leaderand a light.(991)17 This man, brahmin, has total enlightenment. This man has total perfection.This man has the power of total knowledge, the eye of total vision. He has foundthe total ending, he has lost the basic grasping and is free.(992)18 He is enlightenment, he’s a Buddha. He’s a Lord, a Master of Blessings forthe world. He has the eye of vision and he teaches the Way Things Are. Go to himand ask your questions — he will explain it all’.(993)19 When Bāvari heard that word Sambuddha, the name for total enlightenment, hewas lifted to the heights of joy. As his sorrow quietened down, he felt immensedelight take him over.(994)20 The gladness and joy made him eager and deeply thrilled. ‘Where’, he askedthe goddess, ‘does this world-guide live? Which village is he in? Which town?Which state? Let’s go and honour this man, this ultimate being!’(995)21 ‘The Conqueror lives in Sāvatthi in Kosala’, said the goddess. ‘This Sākyanis a wealth of wisdom and a world of knowledge, he’s unharnessed and undefiled,he has the strength of a hero, of a bull. He’s the one to ask abouthead-splitting.’(996)22 So Bāvari the brahmin called his pupils together, all of them versed in Vedicmantras too. ‘Come here, brahmin students’, he said, ‘and listen to this — Ihave something to tell you!(997)23 Something has happened, something that rarely takes place in the world: ASambuddha has arrived. Yes, a man has been born in the world who is nowrecognized as fully enlightened! Brahmins, you must go immediately to Sāvatthito see this perfect being.’(998)24 ‘But brahmin Sir’, said the students, ‘how can we go if we don’t know whatenlightenment looks like? Tell us, Sir, how to recognize it.’(999)25 ‘The Ancient Teachings’, said the brahmin, ‘listed each one of the thirty-twomarks of greatness on a superman.(1000)26 When a person is born with these marks on his body, then we can say that oneof two things will happen to him, that he has two choices open to him, and nomore.(1001)27 He can choose the life of a layman, the home life. Then he will conquer theworld, not by force, but by virtue.(1002)28 Or he can choose to leave his home, to live as a homeless wanderer. And thenhe will become a Sambuddha, a man-of-worth, a fully-enlightened, incomparableone.(1003)29 Now, when you think you’ve found this man you must ask questions in your mindabout my age, my family, my body-marks, my rituals and my pupils — and ask abouthead-splitting too.(1004)30 If he is the Buddha with perfect penetrating vision, then he will answeraloud the questions you’ve asked in your minds.’(1005)31–33 As Bāvari talked his brahmin students listened. There were sixteen ofthem, all of them famous teachers in their own right, namely, Ajita,Tissa-Metteyya, Puṇṇaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, Hemaka, Todeyya,Kappa, Jatukaṇṇī the scholar, Badhrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāja the learnedand the great teacher Piṅgiya the wise — all of them were there. (1006–8)34 They were all well known as teachers and as men who found their enjoyment inlife through their meditation practice. They were men, it was said, who had notlost the scent of their previous good deeds.(1009)35 [When Bāvari had finished his instructions to them] they carefully paid theirrespects and walked past him to his right. With their hide robes and theirbraided plaits of hair they set off towards the north.(1010)36–38 They travelled through the land of the Aḷakas, coming first to Patiṭṭhāna,then to Mahussati, Ujjeni and Gonaddhā. On they went to Vedisā and Vanasa, toKosambí and Sāketa, until they came to the greatest of all cities, Sāvatthi.From there they set out again this time for the land of Magadha. They passed ontheir way through Setavya, Kapilavatthu and the town of Kusinārā. They went onthe Pāvā, to Bhoganāgara [the city of wealth], and then to Vesālí where theycame to the beautiful Pāsāṇaka-Cetiya, the Rock Temple.(1011 – 13)39 They climbed up the mountain path with the zeal and the haste of a merchantdrawn to wealth, or a thirsty man to cool water, or a man with sun-stroke toshade.(1014)40 And there, with the order of monks gathered all around him, sat the Lord, theBlessed One. He was explaining the Dhamma to them: the lion was roaring in thejungle.(1015)41 Ajita saw the man of full enlightenment. It was like the sun shining withoutburning, it was like the moon bright and full on a full-moon day.(1016)42 He could see all the signs of greatness clearly marked on his body.Astonished and overjoyed he stood respectfully to one side and silently thoughthis first question.(1017)43 ‘Tell me’, he asked in his mind, ‘how old my teacher is. Tell me what hisfamily name is, Tell me how many of the marks of greatness he has got, and howwell versed he is in the Vedic mantras. And how many does he teach?’(1018)44 ‘He is 120 years old’, said the Master aloud. ‘His family name is Bāvari. Hehas three of the body-marks. He has complete knowledge of the three Vedas,(1019)45 and also of the Commentaries, the Rituals and the Signs. He instructs 500 andhe has reached the ultimate stage according to his teaching.’(1020)46 ‘Describe Bāvari’s body-marks, master-man, desire-cutter’, said Ajitasilently, ‘so that we have no room at all for doubt.’(1021)47 ‘These are his three body-marks, young man’, said the Master. ‘His tongue islarge enough to cover his mouth. There is a tuft of hair growing between theeyebrows. And the foreskin completely covers the phallus.’(1022)48 – 49 Everybody could hear the Master talking to someone they could not see.Who was asking these questions they couldn’t hear? Was it some god? theywondered. Was it Indra, Brahmā, or Sakka? Who was the Master talking to?Astonished, they made the folded-hand gesture in respect. (1023–24)50 [Meanwhile Ajita was asking another mental question.] ‘Bāvari asked aboutheads, Master’, he thought, ‘and about how they’re split. Please great teacher,answer this question too.’(1025)51 ‘The head’, said the Master, ‘is Not-Understanding. The head is split inpieces and destroyed by Understanding, with its army of powers in support:confidence, mindfulness, meditation, and determination — energy. These are thepowers that split heads.’(1026)52 With the thrill of exultation stiffening every pore of his body the youngbrahmin student bared his shoulder from his hide and got down on to the groundat the feet of the Master.(1027)53 ‘Sir’, he said with this head bowed, ‘Lord, Seer, Bāvari the brahmin and allhis followers are filled with joy and delight! We have come to offer you honourand reverence here at your feet.’(1028)54 ‘May Bāvari the brahmin and all his followers be happy’, said the Master.‘May you too be happy, young man, and may your life be long!(1029)55 For Bāvari, for you and for all of your group there are many different doubtsand confusions. You now have the opportunity to ask about them. Ask now whateveryou want to know.’(1030)56 The Man of Full Enlightenment had given Ajita permission. So the brahminstudent respectfully sat down, made the folded-hand gesture, and addressed hisfirst question to the Thus-Gone [Tathāgata].(1031)1. Ajita’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_2]1 ‘What is it’, said Ajita, ‘that smothers the world? What makes the world sohard to see? What would you say pollutes the world, and what threatens it most?’(1032)2 ‘It is ignorance which smothers’, said the Master, ‘and it is carelessness andgreed which make the world invisible. The hunger of desire pollutes the world,and the great source of fear is the pain of suffering.’(1033)3 ‘In every direction’, said Ajita, ‘the rivers of desire are running. How canwe dam them and what will hold them back? What can we use to close theflood-gates?’(1034)4 ‘Any river can be stopped with the dam of mindfulness’, said the Buddha, ‘Icall it the flood-stopper. And with wisdom you can close the flood-gates.’(1035)5 ‘Sir’, said Ajita, ‘where there is wisdom and mindfulness there is also thehybrid of mind and matter [the generation of individuality]. What brings it allto a halt?’(1036)6 This is the answer to your question, Ajita’, said the Master. ‘Individualitycan be brought to a total end by the cessation of consciousness.’(1037)7 ‘Sir’, said Ajita, ‘there are people here who have mastered all the teachings,and there are students and apprentices, and ordinary people too. Tell me howthese people should live and work.’(1038)8 ‘Let them be like a wanderer, a monk’, said the Buddha. ‘Mindful and skilfulin everyway, they should free themselves from pleasure-hunger and make theirminds [calm and] undisturbed.’(1039)2. Tissa-Metteyya’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_3]Then the brahmin student Tissa-Metteyya asked the Master some questions:1 ‘Who in the world is happy?’ he asked.‘Is there anyone who isn’t full of agitation?‘Is there anyone who can understand the alternatives without getting stuck inhis thinking between them?And who would you say deserved the title “superbeing”?Who is there who isn’t caught up in the patchwork world of greed?’(1040)2 ‘There is a person who is not full of agitation’, answered the Buddha.It is the monk whose actions, in a sensuous world, are pure and good. He doesnot have the thirst of craving, he never loses mindfulness, and he has, by hisown decision, become extinguished, calm.(1041)3 He understands the alternatives without being stuck in the thinking betweenthem. This is whom I would call a superbeing: a man beyond the patchwork worldof greed.’(1042)3. Puṇṇaka’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_4]The brahmin student Puṇṇaka was the next to speak:1 ‘I have come’, he said, ‘to ask a question of the one without desire, the onewith root-depth vision. It is this, Master, that I would like you to explain:why is it that the wise men in the world, the brahmins, the rulers and others,have always offered sacrifices to the gods?’(1043)2 ‘These men’, said the Buddha, ‘were always making offerings to gods because,as they grew older, they wanted to preserve their lives as they were.’(1044)3 ‘But, Master’, said Puṇṇaka, ‘did they ever get beyond old age and birth bymaking all these careful offerings?’(1045)4 ‘Their prayers’, said the Buddha, ‘their praises, their offerings andaspirations were all made on a basis of possession, of reward: they longed forsensual pleasure. These men, these experts in offering, were delighting in thepassion for becoming. These men could not go beyond getting old and being born.’(1046)5 ‘You must explain this to me, Master’, said Puṇṇaka. ‘If all the offerings ofthe experts couldn’t get them beyond ageing and birth, then who of all men, whoof all the gods has ever managed to go beyond?’(1047)6 ‘When a person has assessed the world from top to bottom’, the Master said,‘when there is nothing in the world that raises a flicker of agitation, then hehas become a person free from the smoke-fumes, the tremblings and the hunger ofdesire. He has become calm. He has gone beyond getting old; he has gone beyondbeing born.’(1048)4. Mettagū’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_5]Then the brahmin student Mettagū asked his question:1 ‘Master’, he said, ‘you are clearly a mind of full development and a master ofknowledge. Where on earth do all the different kinds of suffering come from?’(1049)2 ‘This is a question’, said the Master, ‘about the birth and growth ofsuffering. I will answer it in the way that I myself have found it, which isthis: all the different forms of suffering develop from the basic clinging.(1050)3 When a person does not realize this he makes the basic attachment, thesluggish mind will undergo suffering. When a person realizes this he should notmake the basic attachment seeing where suffering starts and grows.’(1051)4 ‘That clearly answers what I asked, Sir’, said Mettagū. ‘Please answer thisone too for me because of your certain knowledge. How do wise men cross theocean? How can they get beyond the ageing process? How can they get beyondbirth? or sadness? or sorrow?’(1052)5 The Master replied: ‘I will explain to you the truth, not based on hearsay.First, realize that this Way is one which can be known here and now, as a resultof which a mindfully-living person releases his hold on the world.’(1053)6 ‘Master Teacher’, Mettagū said, ‘for me there can only be joy and delight tohear you talk about a supreme Way which when a mindfully-living person knows itreleases his hold on the world!’(1054)7 The Master continued: ‘In every direction there are things you know andrecognize, above, below, around and within. Leave them: do not look to them forrest or relief, do not let consciousness dwell on the products of existence, onthings that come and go.(1055)8 This is how the wandering monk lives. He goes from place to place mindful andresolute. He does without cherished objects and comes to understand the world.So he leaves ageing and birth behind; he leaves sadness and sorrow behind; andhe lets go of suffering here itself.’(1056)9 ‘These great words of wisdom are full of joy for me’, said Mettagū. ‘Gotama’sdescription of non-attachment is perfect. This master clearly has let go ofsuffering: he has found and understood just as it is the Way things work.(1057)10 The people whom you, the Wisdom Master, regularly teach will certainly losesuffering. As for me, I have come here to honour you, to bow down before you, ahero. I ask you, Master, to give me frequent teachings.’(1058)11 The Master answered: ‘When you are aware that a man is a brahmin, a master ofknowledge, a person with nothing, a creature with no ties to being or topleasure, then, Mettagū, you have found an ocean-crosser, a traveller beyond thedeserts and the doubts, a voyager who has reached the other shore.(1059)12 This is a knower, a master of knowledge, a hero who has dissipated the pullof constant becoming, a man who has lost the clinging, the trembling and thehunger of desire. This, I would say, is the man who has gone beyond getting old;he has gone beyond being born.’(1060)5. Dhotaka’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_6]The brahmin student Dhotaka was the next to speak:1 ‘Master’, he said, ‘I so much want to hear you speak. Please, Master Teacher,explain to me: can a student of your teachings find the calm of cessation[Nibbāna] for himself?’(1061)2 ‘Any student of my teaching’, said the Buddha, ‘who is eager, intelligent andaware, here and now, can find the calm of cessation for himself.’(1062)3 ‘I can see now’, said Dhotaka, ‘that there is, in this world, a man who hasnothing, a brahmin, a wanderer. I bow down and honour you, Sir, the eye thatsees everything. Please, Man of Sākya, free me from confusion!’(1063)4 ‘It is not in my practise to free anyone from confusion’, said the Buddha.‘When you have understood the most valuable teachings, then you yourself willcross this ocean’.(1064)5 ‘Have pity on me, brahmin, Sir’, said Dhotaka. ‘Please teach me the way ofdetachment, so that I can know it as it is, so that I can live, in this life, inthe peace and independence that is as free as the air in space.’(1065)6 ‘I will explain that peace which is not based on hearsay and is attainablehere and now. It is a peace which, when a mindful person understands it,releases his hold on the world.’(1066)7 ‘Master Teacher’, said Dhotaka, ‘it can only bring me joy to hear about anultimate peace which, when a mindful person understands it, releases his hold onthe world.’(1067)8 ‘In every direction’, said the Buddha, ‘above, below, around and within thereare things you know and recognize. When you realize that these are the thingswhich tie you to the world, then you can lose the thirst of craving, the desirefor constant becomings.’(1068)6. Upasīva’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_7]Then the brahmin student Upasīva asked a question:1 ‘Man of Sākya’, he said, ‘it is not possible for me to cross the massive oceanalone and without help. You are the eye that sees everything; please tell mewhat I can use to help me across the ocean.’(1069)2 The Master told Upasīva: ‘Use these two things to help you cross the ocean:the perception of Nothingness1 [part0011.html#en-5f_1] and the awareness that“there is nothing”. Give up sense pleasures and be free from doubts so you willbegin to see and to long for an end to craving.’(1070)3 ‘Master’, said Upsavīva, ‘When a man is free from attachment to all pleasuresand depends on nothingness, and everything else he lets go, he is freed in thesupreme freedom from perception. But will he permanently be there and not returnagain?’(1071)4 ‘When a man is free’, said the Buddha, ‘from all sense pleasures and dependson nothingness he is free in the supreme freedom from perception. He will staythere and not return again.’(1072)5 ‘Master, you have the eye that sees everything’, said Upasīva, ‘If this manstays many years in this state without returning, will be cooled and freed thereitself, say whether consciousness will still exist for such a person’.(1073)6 ‘It is like a flame struck by a sudden gust of wind’, said the Buddha. ‘In aflash it has gone out and nothing more can be known about it. It is the samewith a wise man freed from mental existence: in a flash he has gone out andnothing more can be known about him.’(1074)7 ‘Please explain this clearly to me, Sir’, said Upasíva. ‘You, a wise man, knowprecisely the way these things work: has the man disappeared, does he simply notexist, or is he in some state of perpetual well-being?’(1075)8 ‘When a person has gone out, then there is nothing by which you can measurehim. That by which he can be talked about is no longer there for him; you cannotsay that he does not exist. When all ways of being, all phenomena are removed,then all ways of description have also been removed.’(1076)Note1 [part0011.html#en5f_1] Third Formless-sphere consciousness (Arūpajjhāna) which is taken by the yogiconcentrating on it as Natthi kiimage [../images/00004.jpeg]ci, There is nothingwhatever’.7. Nanda’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_8]The next of the brahmin students to speak was Nanda. This is what he asked theBuddha:1 ‘Many people’, he said, ‘talk of Wise Men who, they say, are living in theworld. What do you think about this? When they call someone “wise” are theytalking about his knowledge or about the way he lives?’(1077)2 ‘To the experts’, said the Master, ‘the word “wise” has nothing to do with theway a person sees things, or with what he has been taught, or with what heunderstands. To me, Nanda, a wise man is one who has disarmed: he lives inseclusion, without the tremble or the hunger of desire.’(1078)3 ‘Then, Master’, said Nanda, ‘there is another question I must ask you. Allreligious teachers and brahmins have talked about the way to be pure. Some havesaid that purity comes from world-views and from teachings; some have said itcomes from good deeds and religious rituals; others have said it comes fromother things. Would you say, Sir, that these men, living in this world, who’vetaught these things, have gone beyond birth and ageing?’(1079)4 ‘I would say this about religious leaders who teach that views and teachings,or deeds and rituals, or anything else will make you pure; I would say thatthese men, living in this world, have not gone beyond birth and ageing.’(1080)5 ‘But Master’, said Nanda, ‘these men who teach that purity comes from viewsand teachings, or deeds and rituals and other things, these men are religiousleaders, and you say that they are not ocean-crossers. I must ask you anotherquestion Sir: Can you, a Wise Man, say who in the world has gone beyond birthand ageing?’(1081)6 ‘I do not say that all religious teachers and brahmins are wrapped in theshroud of birth and ageing’, said the Buddha. ‘There are some who have let go ofworld-views, of teaching traditions of thoughts. They have let go of religiouspractices and rituals, they have left all the different forms behind and theyhave a total understanding of attachments. For them there are no innerpoison-drives. These, truly, are the ocean-crossers.’(1082)7 ‘How perfect is the Wisdom Master’s explanation of non-attachment!’ saidNanda. ‘It fills me with joy to hear it, and to hear that there are people whohave let go of views, of traditions of thoughts; of religious practices andrituals; and of all the different forms. And these people have a totalunderstanding of attachment — they have lost the inner poison-drives! These arethe people whom I too will call the ocean-crossers!’(1083)8. Hemaka’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_9]Hemaka was the next to speak:1 ‘Before Gotama began to teach’, he said, ‘all teachings I had heard had onlysaid, “This is how things used to be” and “This is how they’re going to be?”Everything was based on tradition and hearsay which just increased my doubts.(1084)2 So please now, Wisdom Master, explain to me the way you teach to put an end tocraving. Explain to me the way you teach which, when a mindful-living personknows it, releases his hold on the world.’(1085)3 ‘The removal of desire and passion for pleasant things, seen, heard orcognized is the sure path for the realization of Nibbāna.(1086)4 Understanding this, those who are mindful have attained this tranquillity ofcomplete Nibbāna in this immediate life. They are calmed for ever. They havecrossed the attachment in this world.’(1087)9. Todeyya’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_10]The brahmin student Todeyya spoke next:1 ‘What, Sir, is the nature of freedom?’, he questioned the Master, ‘when onehas no more desire for pleasure, goes beyond doubt and lives without craving?’(1088)2 ‘A person who has no desires’, said the Buddha, ‘who has gone beyond doubt andwho lives without craving, has indeed found the final freedom. For him there isnothing more to be freed.’(1089)3 ‘All-seeing Sākyan’, said Todeyya, ‘please explain one other thing to me. Iwant to know how to recognize a wise man when I see him. Does the wise man stillhave any desires or is he completely wishless? Does he still need to learn or ishis wisdom complete?’(1090)4 ‘A wise man, Todeyya’, said the Buddha, ‘does not have desires, nor does heneed to learn. He is wishless, he has wisdom, and you can recognize him becausehe is a man of nothing: he is not hanging on to pleasure or to being.’(1091)10. Kappa’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_11]Next was the brahmin student Kappa:1 ‘Sir’, he said, ‘there are people stuck midstream in the terror and the fearof the rush of the river of being, and death and decay overwhelm them. For theirsakes, Sir, tell me where to find an island, tell me where there is solid groundbeyond the reach of all this pain.’(1092)2 ‘Kappa’, said the Master, ‘for the sake of those people stuck in the middle ofthe river of being, overwhelmed by death and decay, I will tell you where tofind solid ground.(1093)3 There is an island, an island which you cannot go beyond. It is a place ofnothingness, a place of non-possession and of non-attachment. It is the totalend of death and decay, and this is why I call it Nibbāna [the extinguished, thecool].(1094)4 There are people who, in mindfulness, have realized this and are completelycooled here and now. They do not become slaves working for Māra, for Death; theycannot fall into his power.’(1095)11. Jatukaṇṇī’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_12]Then the brahmin student Jatukaṇṇī spoke:1 ‘I had heard’, he said, ‘that there was an ocean-crosser, a hero, desiring thedesireless. And so I have come to ask a question of this man without desire.Tell me this, eye of instant seeing-knowing: what is the state of peace? Pleaseexplain it to me as it really is.(1096)2 You, Master, rule desire and pleasure like the sun, with heat and light, rulesand controls the earth. I have only a little understanding, Sir, and you are aglobe full of wisdom. Tell me how to find and know the Way of giving up thisworld of births and ageings.’(1097)The Buddha replied to Jatukaṇṇī:3 ‘Lose the greed for pleasure. See how letting go of the world is peacefulness.There is nothing that you need hold on to and there is nothing that you needpush away.(1098)4 Dry up the remains of your past and have nothing for your future. If you donot cling to the present then you can go from place to place in peace.(1099)5 There is a greed that fixes on the individual body-mind. When that greed hascompletely gone, then, brahmin, there will be no more inner poison-drives,without which you are immune from death.’(1100)12. Bhadrāvudha’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_13]The student brahmin Bhadrāvudha spoke next:1 ‘I have come, he said, ‘to ask a question. Thirst-breaker, wishless, free andwise, beyond time and home — life and pleasure — please, ocean-crosser,(1101)2 for all the different people here who have come from different places tolisten to your words. Tell us about the way that you have found and known.’(1102)The Master replied:3 There is, in taking things, a thirst, a clinging, a grasping. You must loseit. You must lose it altogether, above, below, around and within. It makes nodifference what it is you are grasping at: when a man grasps, Māra stands besidehim.(1103)4 Therefore, the monks, realizing this should not grasp at anything, beingmindful. He should see the beings that are creatures of attachment as tied tothe power of death.’(1104)13. Udaya’s Questions [part0006.html#sec5_14]Then the brahmin student Udaya spoke:1 ‘Gone beyond in every way’, he said, ‘the ultimate in everything. When he sitsin meditation there is no poison to infect him, no dust speck to impede him: Hehas done what has to be done.[This is the man I have come to with my question, and this, Sir, is it:) Can youtell me about the knowledge that frees? Can you tell me how to removeignorance?’(1105)2 ‘The removal of both the intense desire for sensuous things,’ said the Buddha,‘and the grief, the rejection of laziness and the resistance to worry’.(1106)3 The purity of perfect, balanced mindfulness, built on a basis of seeing theWay Things Are: this is liberation-knowledge and this is the destruction ofignorance.’(1107)[Udaya asked another question:]4 ‘What binds and ties down the world? What causes the wander ing? What is itthat you abandon in order to find Nibbāna?’(1108)5 ‘That which ties you down’, said the Buddha, ‘is the desire for pleasure. Thewandering is applied thought. And the way to Nibbāna is to abandon the thirst ofdesire.’(1109)6 ‘I have come with these questions, Master, and I hope you will answer onemore’, said Udaya. ‘How does the mindful wanderer bring his mind-flow to anend?’(1110)7 The Master replied: ‘The sensations that he feels from the inside have no morefascination for him. And the sensations that he feels from the outside no longerfascinate. The wanderer is mindful and brings his mind-flow to an end.’(1111)14. Posāla’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_15]Then the student, Posāla, got up to speak:1 ‘In everything’, he said to the Master, ‘you have reached perfection. There isnot a movement of desire nor a remnant of doubt left in you. And so I have cometo you, who can explain what has happened in the past, to ask this question.(1112)2 I want to ask you, Man of Sākya, about knowledge. If a man is no longerconfined to seeing forms, if he has discarded materialist limitations and hesees that there is neither inner nor outer substance to things, is there thenanything more for him to know?’(1113)3 To the Tathāgata, the man-thus-come’, replied the Buddha, ‘all the aspects andstages of mind are clear. And so, when a person who has set his sights onfreedom reaches his goal, the Tathāgata knows what stage he has reached.(1114)4 When he has realized that the binding power of pleasure is rooted innothingness, then he has come to a clear understanding of this process. Thisknowledge he, the completely accomplished brahmin, has achieved completely.’(1115)15. Mogharāja’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_16]The next to speak was the brahmin student Mogharāja:1 ‘Man of Sākya’, he said, ‘I have asked about this twice before withoutreceiving an answer from the Wisdom-Eye. But I have heard that if a wisdom-godis asked a third time, then, he will give an answer.(1116)2 I do not know, famous Gotama, what attitude you take towards this world andtowards the other world, the world of Brāhma and the gods.(1117)3 So, because of your insight into excellence, I have come to ask you aboutthis. What is the best way for a person to regard the world so that the King ofDeath won’t see him?’(1118)The Master replied:4 ‘If you are always aware, Mogharāja, you will look at the world and see itsemptiness. If you give up looking at yourself as a soul [as a fixed and specialidentity], then you will have given yourself a way to go beyond death. Look atthe world like this and the King of Death will not see you.’(1119)16. Pingiya’s Question [part0006.html#sec5_17]Then the brahmin Pirìgiya spoke:1 ‘I am old and decaying. My body is weak and my skin is pale. I can hardly seeand I only hear with difficulty. Don’t let me die while I am still in confusionbut teach me about the Way Things Are so that I shall know how to leave birthand ageing behind me.’(1120)2 ‘Look’, replied the Buddha, ‘look how many people are tormented by pain. Lookhow careless they are, and how greatly they suffer, because of body and forms.If you do not want to go on and on becoming, Piṅgiya, you must let go of thebody and of forms.’(1121)3 ‘In all the ten directions’, said Piṅgiya, ‘above, below, and in every quarterof the compass, there is not a thing that you have not heard, seen, known, orunderstood. Teach me about the Way Things Are so that I shall know how to leavebirth and ageing behind me.’(1122)4 ‘Can you see’, replied the Buddha, ‘how people are oppressed by desire? Canyou see how they are racked and worn by ageing? If you do not want to go on andon becoming, Piṅgiya, you must let go of craving.’(1123)Pārāyana Thuti Gāthā [part0006.html#sec5_18](Epilogue) [part0006.html#sec5_2]This is what the Master said when the sixteen brahmins came to the Rock Templein Magadha to ask him to answer their questions.If you know what each question means, see what each question implies and live inaccordance with the Way Things Are then you will go beyond. You will cross theocean of death and ageing and reach the other shore.These things lead to that other shore. That is why this teaching is calledPārāyana — ‘The Way to the Beyond’.1 There were sixteen of them who came to see the Buddha that time. There wasAjita, Tissa-Metteyya, Puņņaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasíva, Nanda and Hemaka;(1124)2 Todeyya, Kappa and Jatukaņņï the scholar; Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla,Mogharāja the learned, and the great Pińgiya the wise.(1125)3 These were the men who came to see the Buddha, the man of perfect action. Theycame to the Buddha to put their complex questions to this paragon ofunderstanding.(1126)4 The Buddha answered the questions with the exactness of truth, just as thingsare; the brahmins were pleased to hear the words of this wise man.(1127)5 And so, filled with pleasure by the clear-sighted vision of this Kinsman ofthe Sun,1 [part0011.html#en-5g_1] they settled down to a life of purity andgoodness spent in the shelter of the precious wisdom of the Buddha.(1128)6 Anyone whose life accords with what the Buddha taught in these answers goesacross the ocean. From here to the beyond,(1129)7 from this shore to the other: this is crossing the ocean, this is travellingon the highest path. It is a path that leads to that other shore; that is why itis called Pārāyana — The Way to the Beyond’.(1130)Piṅgiya’s Praises of The Way to the Beyond8 ‘I will sing you the praises of The Way to the Beyond’, said Pirìgiya (when hereturned to where the brahmin Bāvari lives on the banks of the River Godhāvari).‘It was described to us by this man exactly as he saw it. But then, there isn’tany reason why a man like him should lie — a mammoth of knowledge and completelypure, a man without desire.(1131)9 When a voice has none of the glibness of pride and none of the ingrainedstains of ignorance, then its words are full of sweetness and beauty. It is suchwords that I praise now.(1132)10 They call him Buddha, Enlightened, Awake, dissolving darkness, with totalvision, and knowing the world to its ends, he has gone beyond all the states ofbeing and of becoming. He has no inner poison-drives: he is the totalelimination of suffering. This man, brahmin Bāvari, is the man I follow.(1133)11 It is like a bird that leaves the bushes of the scrubland and flies to thefruit trees of the forest. I too have left the bleary half-light of opinions;like a swan I have reached a great lake.(1134)12 Up till now, before I heard Gotama’s teaching, people had always told methis: “This is how it has always been, and this is how it will always be”; onlythe constant refrain of tradition, a breeding ground for speculation.(1135)13 This prince, this beam of light, Gotama, was the only one who dissolved thedarkness. This man Gotama is a universe of wisdom and a world of understanding,(1136)14 a teacher whose Dhamma is the Way Things Are, instant, immediate and visibleall around, eroding desire without harmful side-effects, with nothing else quitelike it anywhere in the world.’(1137)15 ‘But Piṅgiya’, said Bāvari, ‘why then don’t you spend all your time, yourevery moment, with this man Gotama, this universe of wisdom, this world ofunderstanding,(1138)16 this teacher whose Dhamma is the Way Things Are, instant, immediate andvisible all around, eroding desire without harmful side-effects, and withnothing else quite like it anywhere in the world?’(1139)17 ‘Brahmin, Sir’, said Pińgiya, ‘there is no moment for me, however small, thatis spent away from Gotama, from this universe of wisdom, this world ofunderstanding,(1140)18 this teacher whose teaching is the Way Things Are, instant, immediate andvisible all around, eroding desire without harmful side effects, with nothingelse quite like it anywhere in the world.’(1141)19 ‘You see, Sir’, said Piṅgiya, ‘with constant and careful vigilance it ispossible for me to see him with my mind as clearly as with my eyes, in night aswell as day. And since I spend my nights revering him, there is not, to my mind,a single moment spent away from him.(1142)20 I cannot now move away from the teaching of Gotama: the powers of confidenceand joy, of intellect and awareness, hold me there. Whichever way this universeof wisdom goes it draws me with it.(1143)21 Physically, I cannot move like that — my body is decaying, I am old and weak— but the driving power of purposeful thought propels me with it without break.(1144)22 There was a time when, writhing in the mud of the swamps, I could only driftfrom one stone to the next. But then I saw the Sambuddha, fully awake and freefrom defilement.’(1145)Then the Buddha spoke:23 ‘Piṅgiya’, he said, ‘other people have freed themselves by the power ofconfidence. Vakkali, Bhadrāvudha and Āḷavi-Gotama have all done this. You tooshould let that strength release you; you too will go to the further shore,beyond the draw of death.’(1146)24 ‘These words’, said Piṅgiya, ‘are the words of a man of wisdom. As I hearthem I become more confident. This man is Sambuddha: he has opened the curtainsand woken up. There is nothing barren there; his mind is clear and luminous.(1147)25 Everything accessible to knowledge is known to him, even the ultimatesubtleties of godhood. There are no more questions for the doubtful who come tohim: the teacher has answered them all.(1148)26 Yes, I shall go there. I shall go beyond change, I shall go beyondformations; I shall go beyond comparison. There are no more doubts. You mayconsider this as mind released.’(1149)Note1 [part0011.html#en5g_1] Ādicca. This appellation has been used synonymously for the more frequent wordsuriya. The Buddha is sometimes styled the Kinsman of the Sun (ādiccabandhu)."},{"pageContent":"Bibliography [part0003.html#ref]Apart from complete translations in German, Italian and Swedish, together withindividual suttas to be found in Asian and Western Buddhist magazines, thefollowing complete translations and anthologies have been published in English:E.W.
