This vast body of scriptures, recorded in the ancient Indian language now known as Pali, is regarded by the Theravada school of Buddhism as the definitive recension of the Buddha-word, and among scholars too it is gen-erally considered our most reliable source for the original teach-ings of the historical Buddha Gotama. This translation is an extensively revised version of an original draft translation made by the distinguished English scholar-monk, Bhikkhu Nffi:\\amoli (1905-1960). During his eleven years' life in the Buddhist Order, passed entirely at the Island Hermitage in south Sri Lanka, Yen. Nffi:\\amoli had rendered into English some of the most difficult and intricate texts of Pali Buddhism, among them the encyclopaedic Visuddhimagga. Following his premature death at the age of 55, three thick hand-bound notebooks containing a handwritten translation of the entire Majjhima Nikaya were found among his effects. However, although all 152 suttas of the Majjhima had been trans-lated, the work was obviously still in an ongoing process of revi-sion, with numerous crossouts and overwritings and a fair num-ber of mrresolved inconsistencies. The translation also employed an experimental scheme of highly original renderings for Pali doctrinal terms that Yen. Nffi:\\amoli had come to prefer to his ear-lier scheme and had overwritten into the notebooks. He had used this new set of renderings in several of his final publications, offering an explanation for his choices in an appendix to The 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"14 The Majjhima Nikl1ya Minor Readings and The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning, his transla-tion of the Khuddakaplitha and its commentary. In 1976 Bhikkhu Khantipalo made a selection of ninety suttas from the notebooks, which he edited into a fairly consistent and readable version rearranged according to a topical sequence he himself devised. This was published in Thailand in three vol-umes under the title A Treasury of the Buddha's Words. In this edition Yen. Khantipalo had endeavoured to make as few changes as possible in the original translation by Yen. Nal).amoli, though he inevitably found it desirable to replace some of the latter's innovative renderings with better-known ~quivalents, generally choosing the terminology that Yen. Nal).amoli had used in The Path of Purification, his excellent translation of the Visuddhimagga. The present work contains finished translations of all 152 suttas. In editing the ninety suttas selected by Yen. Khantipalo, I have worked from the version found in A Treasury of the Buddha's Words, referring to Yen. Nal).amoli's notebooks when-ever questions arose or problematic passages were encountered. The other sixty-two suttas had to be freshly edited from the notebooks. The translations of all 152 suttas have been checked against the original Pali texts and I hope that all errors' and omissions have been rectified. My aim in editing and revising this material, I must frankly state, has not been to reconstruct the suttas in a way that would conform as closely as possible to the intentions of the original translator. My aim has been, rather, to tum out a translation of the Majjhima Nikaya that Simultaneously approaches two ideals: first, fidelity to the intended meaning of the texts them-selves; and second, the expression of that meaning in an idiom that would be intelligible to a modem reader seeking in the Pali suttas personal guidance in the proper understanding and con-duct of life. Terminological exactitude and internal consistency have been important guidelines underlying the endeavour to achieve those ideals, but care has been taken that their pursuit should leave the translation transparent as to the meaning. To produce a translation of the Majjhima Nikaya that is both technically precise and lucid in expression required numerous revisions in the manuscript version. Most were quite minor but a few were substantial. Numerous alterations were made in the , [ L Preface 15 rendering of Pali doctrinal terms, most of Yen. Khantipalo's changes having been incorporated. In place of Yen. Nal).amoli's novel renderings I have in most cases returned to the clearer and better established terminology he employed in The Path of Purification. When doubts arose I always turned for help to Yen. Nyanaponika Mahathera, whose wise advice helped to steer this translation closer towards its two guiding ideals. The han-dling of several important technical terms is discussed at the end of the Introduction, to which is attached a list showing the terminological changes that were made for this edition. By con-sulting the list the reader can obtain some idea of how the man-uscript translation read. A glossary in the back gives the English renderings used for the major Pali doctrinal terms found in the Majjhima Nikaya as well as Pali words and mean-ings not included in the Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary. The subject index also includes, for most entries, the Pali term after its chosen English rendering. Botanical names that could not be easily rendered by familiar English equiva-lents have been left untranslated. Yen. N~amoli's translation was based primarily on the Pali Text Society's roman-script edition of the Majjhima Nikaya, published in three volumes, the first edited by V. Trenckner (1888), the second two by Robert Chalmers (1898, 1899). This edition was also used to check the translation, but on problemat-ic passages I consulted as well two other editions: the Burmese Buddhasasana Samiti's Sixth Buddhist Council edition in Burmese script and the Sinhala-script Buddha Jayanti edition published in Sri Lanka. Instances are not unusual where the reading in one or the other of these editions was preferred to that of the PTS edition, though only occasionally are these men-tioned in the notes. Seldom too do the notes refer to I. B. Horner's long-standing English translation of the Majjhima Nikaya, The Collection of the Middle Length Sayings, with which I sometimes compared Yen. Nal).amoli's translation. Since the first volume of that translation was published in 1954, and the next two in 1957 and 1959, while Yen. N~amoli's manuscript indi-cates that he did his revised translation between 1953 and 1956, it seems unlikely that he had consulted Horner's version in preparing his own; at most, he might have had access to the first volume after he had completed his first volume."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 The Majjhima Nikaya The text of the translation is divided into numerical sections. These divisions were introduced by Yen. Nal)amoli into his manuscript version of the suttas and are not found in the PTS edition of the Majjhima Nikaya. Sometimes, when logic seemed to dictate it, I have made minor alterations in the divisions. The section numbers are included in the sutta references in the Introduction, Notes, and Indexes. Thus, for example, a reference to MN 26.18 means Majjhima Sutta No. 26, section 18. The numbers at the top of the pages refer to the volume and page number of the PTS edition of the Majjhima Nikaya, as do the bracketed numbers embedded in the text (except for MN 92 and MN 98, wherein the numbers refer to the PTS edition of the Sutta Nipata). The Introduction aims to provide the reader with a thorough study guide to the Majjhima Nikaya by systematically surveying the principal teachings of the Buddha contained in this collec-tion along with references to the suttas where fuller expositions of those teachings can be found. More elementary information on the Pali Canon and on Pali Buddhism in general will be found in Maurice Walshe's introduction to his recent translation of the complete Dlgha Nikaya, Thus Have I Heard, which the .pre-sent publication is intended to parallel. As a way of easing the reader's entrance into the canonical texts themselves, a sum-mary of the Majjhima's 152 suttas follows the Introduction. To clarify difficult passages in the suttas and to shed addition-al light on passages whose m~aning is richer than appears at first sight, a copious set of back notes has been provided. Many of these notes are drawn from the c:ommentaries on the Majjhima, of which there are two. One is the commentary prop-er, the Majjhima Niktiya Atthakatha, also known as the Papaficasudanr. This was composed in the fifth century by the great Buddhist commentator,.Acariya Buddhaghosa, who based it on the ancient commentaries (no longer extant) that had been preserved for centuries by the Sangha of the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. The commentary is of value not only for elucidating the meaning of the texts but also for filling in the background of events that led to the promulgation of the discourses. The other commentarial work is the subcommen-tary, the Majjhima Niktiya Tfkti, ascribed to Acariya Dhammapala, J Preface 17 who probably lived and worked in South India a century or more later than Acariya Buddhaghosa. The main purpose of the TIka is to clear up obscure or difficult points in the Atthakatha, but in doing so the author often sheds additional light on the meaning of the canonical text. In order to keep the notes as con-cise as possible, almost always the commentaries have been paraphrased rather than quoted directly. I am aware that the Notes sometimes repeat things already explained in the Introduction, but in a work of this nature such repetitions can be of use, particularly as novel ideas briefly treat-ed in the Introduction may slip the reader's memory at the time of reading a sutta to which they pertain. In conclusion I want to mention the contributions that others have made to the completion of this project. First, I wish to thank Yen. Nyanaponika Mahathera for first encouraging me to take up this task, which seemed so daunting at the outset, and then for providing valuable advice at every crucial turn along the way. Not only was he always ready to dis-cuss difficult points, but despite deteriorating vision, which drastically reduced the time he had available for reading, he still read through the Introduction, the Notes, and the knottier sut-tas, offering helpful suggestions. Second, I thank Yen. Khantipalo (now Laurence Mills) for per-mission to use his versions of the ninety suttas in A Treasury of the Buddha's Words as the working basis for this edition. The work he did on those suttas almost two decades ago greatly facilitated the preparation of this volume. Third, I must mention the tremendous help received from Ayya NyanasirI, who subedited the initial draft, made numer-ous suggestions for minor improvements, and typed out the entire manustript. Even though, as my conception of the editorial task changed, several suttas had. to be typed a second time, and a few a third time, this was always done with patience and understanding. Fourth, I thank two fellow bhikkhus, Yen. Thanissaro (U.s.A.) and Yen. DhammaviharI (Sri Lanka), for reading portions of the manuscript and suggesting minor improvements. Finally, I wish to express my appreciation to Dr. Nicholas Ribush for his encouragement and helpfulness and to Wisdom ________ . _______ \"\"1,'"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"18 The Majjhima Nikiiya Publications for doing such a fine job of production.

BHIKKHU BODHI Forest Hermitage Kandy, Sri Lanka 1 Introduction THE MAJJHIMA NIKA YA AS A COLLECTION THE MAJJHIMA NIKAYA is the second collection of the Buddha's discourses found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. Its title means literally the Middle Collection, and it is so called because the suttas it contains are generally of middle length, compared with the longer suttas of the Dlgha Nikaya, which precedes it, and the shorter suttas making up the two major collections that follow it, the Samyutta Nikaya and the Anguttara Nikaya. The Majjhima Nikaya consists of 152 suttas. These are divided into three parts called Sets of Fifty (pa1J.1J.iisa), though the last set actually contains fifty-two suttas. Within each part the suttas are further grouped into chapters or divisions (vagga) of ten suttas each, the next to the last division containing twelve suttas. The names assigned to these divisions are often derived solely from the titles of their opening sutta (Of, in some cases, pair of suttas) and thus are scarcely indicative of the material found within the divisions themselves. A partial exception is the Middle Fifty, where the division titles usually refer to the principal type of interlocutor or key figure in each of the suttas they contain. Even then the connection between the title and the contents is sometimes tenuous. The entire system of classification appears to have been devised more for the purpose of convenience than because of any essential homogeneity of subject matter in the suttas comprised under a single division. There is also no particular pedagogical sequence in the suttas, no unfolding development of thought. Thus while different suttas illuminate each other and one will fill in ideas merely suggested by another, virtually any sutta may be taken up for individual 19"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"20 The Majjhima Niktiya study and will be found comprehensible on its own. Of course, the study of the entire compilation will naturally yield the richest harvest of understanding. If the Majjhima Nikaya were to be characterised by a single phrase to distinguish it from among the other books of the Pali Canon, this might be done by describing it as the collection that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. Like the Dlgha Nikaya, the Majjhima is replete with drama and nar-rative, while lacking much of its predecessor's tendency towards imaginative embellishment and profusion of legend. Like the Samyutta, it contains some of the profoundest discourses in the Canon, disclosing the Buddha's radical insights into the nature of existence; and like the Anguttara, it covers a wide range of topics of practical applicability. In contrast to those two Nikayas, however, the Majjhima sets forth this material not in the form of short, self-contained utterances, but in the context of a fascinating procession of scenarios that exhibit the Buddha's resplendence of wisdom, his skill in adapting his teachings to the needs and proclivities of his interlocutors, his wit and gentle humour, his majestic sublimity, and his compassionate humanity. . Naturally the greatest number of discourses in the Majjhima are addressed to the bhikkhus -the monks - since they lived in closest proximity to the Master and had followed him into homelessness to take upon themselves his complete course of training. But in the Majjhima we do not meet t..he Buddha only in his role as head of the Order.. Repeatedly we see him engaged in living dialogue with people from the many different strata of ancient Indian society -with kings and princes, with brahmins and ascetics, with simple villagers and erudite philosophers, with earnest seekers and vain disputants. It is perhaps in this scripture above all others that the Buddha emerges in the role ascribed to him in the canonical verse of homage to the Blessed One as \"the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, the teacher of gods and humans.\" It is not the Buddha alone who appears in the Majjhima in the role of teacher. The work also introduces us to the accomplished disciples he produced who carried on the transmission of his teaching. Of the 152 suttas in the collection, nine are spoken by the venerable Sariputta, the General of the Dhamma; three of r Introduction 21 these (MN 9, MN 28, MN 141) have become basic texts for the study of Buddhist doctrine in monastic schools throughout the Theravada Buddhist world. The venerable Ananda, the Buddha's personal attendant during the last twenty-five years of his life, delivers seven suttas and participates in many more. Four suttas are spoken by the venerable Maha Kaccana, who excelled in elaborating upon the brief but enigmatic sayings of the Master, and two by the second chief disciple, the venerable Maha Moggallana, one of which (MN 15) has been recommended for a monk's daily reflections. A dialogue between the venerable Sariputta and the venerable PUJ).l).a Mantal).iputta (MN 24) explores a scheme of seven stages of purification that was to form the outline for Acariya Buddhaghosa's great treatise on the Buddhist path, the Visuddhimagga. Another dialogue (MN 44) introduces the bhikkhunI Dhammadinna, whose replies to a series of probing questions were so adroit that the Buddha sealed them for posterity with the words \"I would have explained it to you in the same way.\" The formats of the suttas are also highly variegated. The majority take the form of discourses proper, expositions of the teaching that pour forth uninterrupted from the mouth of the Enlightened One. A few among these are delivered in a series of unadorned instructional propositions or guidelines to practice, but most are interlaced with striking similes and parables, which flash through and light up the dense mass of doctrine in ways that impress it deeply upon the mind. Other suttas unfold in dialogue and discussion, and in some the dramatic or narra-tive element predominates. Perhaps the best known and most widely appreciated among these is the Angulimiila Sutta (MN 86), which relates how the Buddha subdued the notorious bandit Angulimala and transformed him into an enlightened saint. Equally moving, though in a different way, is the story of Ratthapala (MN 82), the youth of wealthy family whose preco-cious insight into the universality of suffering was so compelling that he was prepared to die rather than accept his parents' refusal to permit him to go forth into homelessness. Several sut-tas centre upon debate, and these highlight the Buddha's wit and delicate sense of irony as well as his dialectical skills. Particular mention might be made of MN 35 and MN 56, with their subtle humour leavening the seriousness of their contents."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"22 The Majjhima Nikiiya In a class of its own is the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (MN 49), in which the Buddha visits the Brahma-world to detach a deluded deity from his illusions of grandeur and soon finds himself locked in a gripping contest with Mara the Evil One -an incon-ceivable alliance of Divinity and Devil defending the sanctity of being against the Buddha's call for deliverance into Nibbana, the cessation of being. THE BUDDHA IN THE MAJJHlMA NlKA Y A Biographical information for its own sake was never an overrid-ing concern of the redactors of the Pali Canon, and thus the data the Majjhima provides on the life of the Buddha is scanty and uncoordinated, included principally because of the light it sheds on the Buddha as the ideal exemplar of the spiritual quest and the fully qualified teacher. Nevertheless, though it subordinates biography to other concerns, the Majjhima does give us the fullest canonical account of the Master's early life as a Bodhisatta, a seeker of enlightenment. With the DIgha it shares the miraculous story of his conception and birth (MN 123), but its version of his great renunciation has been stripped to bare essentials and related in the stark terms of existential realism. In his youth, having seen through the sensual delights to which his princely status entitled him (MN 75.10), the Bodhisatta decided that it was futile to pursue things subject like himself to ageing and death and thus, with his parents weeping, he left the home life and went in search of the ageless and deathless, Nibbana (MN 26.13). MN 26 tells of his discipleship under two accom-plished meditation teachers of the day, his mastery of their sys-tems, and his consequent disillusionment. MN 12 and MN 36 describe his ascetic practices during his six hard years of striv-ing, a path he pursued almost to the point of death. MN 26 and MN 36 both relate in lean and unembellished terms his attain-ment of enlightenment, which they view from different angles, while MN 26 takes us past the enlightenment to the decision to teach and the instruction of his first diSciples. From that point on connected biography breaks off in the Majjhima and can only be reconstructed partially and hypothetically. Again, despite the absence of any systematic account, the Majjhima offers a sufficient number of cameo portraits of the r Introduction 23 Buddha for us to obtain, with the aid of information provided by other sources, a fairly satisfactory picture of his daily activi-ties and annual routine during the forty-five years of his min-. istry. A commentarial text shows the Buddha's daily schedule as having been divided between periods of instructing the bhikkhus, giving discourses to the laity, and secluded medita-tion, during which he usually dwelt either in the \"abode of voidness\" (MN 121.3, MN 122.6) or in the attainment of great compassion. The day's single meal was always taken in the forenoon, either received by invitation or collected on alms-round, and his sleep was restricted to a few hours per night, except in the summer, when he rested briefly during the middle of the day (MN 36.46). The annual routine was determined by the Indian climate, which divided the year into three seasons-a cold season from November through February, a hot season from March through June, and a rainy season from July through October. As was customary among the ascetics of ancient India, the Buddha and his monastic community would remain at a fixed residence during the rainy season, when tor-rential rains and swollen rivers made travel almost impossible. During the rest of the year he would wander through the Ganges Valley expounding his teachings to all who were pre-pared to listen. The Buddha's main seats of residence for the rains retreat (vassa) were located at SavatthI in the state of Kosala and Raja-gaha in the state of Magadha. At SavatthI he would usually stay at Jeta's Grove, a park offered to him by the wealthy merchant AnathapiI:t9ika, and accordingly a great number of Majjhima discourses are recorded as having been given there. Occasionally at SavatthI he would reside instead at the Eastern Park, offered by the devout lay-woman Visakha, also known as \"Migara's mother.\" In Rajagaha he often stayed at the Bamboo Grove, offered by the king of Magadha, Seniya Bimbisara, or for greater seclusion, on Vulture Peak outside the city. His wander-ings, during which he was usually accompanied by a large ret-inue of bhikkhus, ranged from the Angan country (close to modern West Bengal) to the Himalayan foothills and the Kuru country (modern Delhi). Occasionally, when he saw that a spe-cial case required his individual attention, he would leave the Sangha and travel alone (see MN 75, MN 86, MN 140)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"24 The Majjhima Nikaya Although the Canon is precise and reliable in affording such details, for the early Buddhist community interest focuses upon the Buddha not so much in his concrete historical particularity as in his archetypal significance. Whereas outsiders might view him as merely one among the many spiritual teachers of the day - as \"the recluse Gotama\" - to his disciples \"he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the holy one, ... the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata\" (MN 18.12). The last term in this series is the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring to himself and it underscores his significance as the Great Arrival who brings to fulfilment a cos-mic, repetitive pattern of events. The Pali commentators explain the word as meaning \"thus come\" (tatha agata) and \"thus gone\" (tatha gata), that is, the one who comes into our midst bearing the message of deathlessness to which he has gone by his own prac-tice of the path. As the Tathagata he possesses the ten powers of knowledge and the four intrepidities, which enable him to roar his \"lion's roar\" in the assemblies (MN 12.9-20). He is not merely a wise sage or a benevolent moralist but the latest in the line of Fully Enlightened Ones, each of whom arises singly in an age of spiritual darkness, discovers the deepest truths about the nature of existence, and establishes a Dispensation (sasana) through which the path to deliverance again becomes accessible to the world. Even those of his disciples who have attained unsurpass-able vision, practice, and deliverance still honour and venerate the Tathagata as one who, e~lightened himself, teaches others for the sake of their enlightenment (MN 35.26). Looking back at him following his demise, the first generation of monks could say: \"The Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path,\" which is followed by and attained to afterwards by his disciples (MN 108.5). ' THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS The Buddha's teaching is called the Dhamma, a word that can signify both the truth transmitted by the teaching and the con-ceptual-verbal medium by which that truth is expressed in order that it can be communicated and made comprehensible. The r i ,i.-........... Introduction 25 Dhamma is not a body of immutable dogmas or a system of speculative thought. It is essentially a means, a raft for crossing over from the \"near shore\" of 'ignorance, craving, and suffering to the \"far shore\" of transcendental peace and freedom (MN 22.13). Because his aim in setting forth his teaching is a pragmatic one - deliverance from suffering -the Buddha can dismiss the whole gamut of metaphysical speculation as a futile endeavour. Those committed to it he compares to a man struck by a poisoned arrow who refuses the surgeon's help until he knows the details about his assailant and his weaponry (MN 63.5). Being struck by the arrow of craving, afflicted by ageing and death, humanity is in urgent need of help. The rem-edy the Buddha brings as the surgeon for the world (MN 105.27) is the Dhamma, which discloses both the truth of our existential plight and the means by which we can heal our wounds. The Dhamma that the Buddha discovered and taught consists at its core in Four Noble Truths: • the noble truth of suffering (dukkha) • the noble truth of the origin of suffering (dukkhasamudaya) • the noble truth of the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodha) • the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffer-ing (dukkhanirodhagaminl patipada) It is these four truths that the Buddha awakened to on the night of his enlightenment (MN 4.31, MN 36.42), made known to the world when he set rolling the matchless Wheel of the Dhamma at Benares (MN 141.2), and held aloft through the forty-five years of his ministry as \"the teaching special to the Buddhas\" (MN 56.18). In the Majjhima Nikaya the Four Noble Truths are expounded concisely at MN 9.14-18 and in detail in MN 141, while in MN 28 the venerable Sariputta develops an original exposition of the truths unique to that sutta. Yet, though they may be brought forth explicitly only on occasion, the Four Noble Truths structure the entire teaching of the Buddha, con-taining its many other principles just as the elephant's footprint contains the footprints of all other animals (MN 28.2). The pivotal notion around which the truths revolve is that of dukkha, translated here as \"suffering.\" The Pali word originally meant simply pain and suffering, a meaning it retains in the texts when it is used as a quality of feeling: in these cases it has"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26 The Majjhima Nikaya been rendered as \"pain\" or \"painful.\" As the first noble truth, however, dukkha has a far wider significance, reflective of a comprehensive philosophical vision. While it draws its affective colouring from its connection with pain and suffering, and cer-tainly includes these, it points beyond such restrictive meanings to the inherent unsatisfactoriness of everything conditioned. This unsatisfactoriness of the conditioned is due to its imperma-nence, its vulnerability to pain, and its inability to provide com-plete and lasting satisfaction. The notion of impermanence (aniccata) forms the bedrock for the Buddha's teaching, having been the initial insight that impelled the Bodhisatta to leave the palace in search of a path to enlightenment. Impermanence, in the Buddhist view, comprises the totality of conditioned existence, ranging in scale from the cosmic to the microscopic. At the far end of the spectrum the Buddha's vision reveals a universe of immense dimensions evolving and disintegrating in repetitive cycles throughout beginningless time -\"many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion\" (MN 4.27). In the middle range the mark of imper-manence comes to manifestation in our inescapable mortality, '. our condition of being bound to ageing, sickness, and death (MN 26.5), of possessing a body that is subject \"to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration\" (MN 74.9). And at the close end of the spe~trum, the Buddha's teaching dis-closes the radical imperman~nce uncovered only by sustained attention to experience in its living immediacy: the fact that all the constituents of our being, bodily and mental, are in constilllt process, arising and passing away in rapid succ~ssion from moment to moment without any persistent underlying sub-stance. In the very act of observation they are undergoing \"destruction, vanishing, fading away, and ceasing\" (MN 74.11). This characteristic of impermanence that marks everything conditioned leads directly to the recognition of the universality of dukkha or suffering. The Buddha underscores' this all-pervasive aspect of dukkha when, in his explanation of the first noble truth, he says, \"In short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering.\" The five aggregates affected by clinging (panc'upadanakkhandha).are a classificatory scheme that the Buddha had devised for demonstrating the composite nature of .,. Introduction 27 personality. The scheme comprises every possible type of condi-tioned state, which it distributes into five categories - material form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. The aggregate of material form (rupa) includes the physical body with its sense faculties as well as external material objects. The aggregate of feeling (vedana) is the affective element in experi-ence, either pleasant, painful, or neutral. Perception (sanna), the third aggregate, is the factor responsible for noting the qualities of things and also accounts for recognition and memory. The formations aggregate (sankhara) is an umbrella term that includes all volitional, emotive, and intellective aspects of men-tal life. And consciousness (vinnaIJa), the fifth aggregate, is the basic awareness of an object indispensable to all cognition. As the venerable Sariputta shows in his masterly analysis of the first noble truth, representatives of all five aggregates are pre-sent on every occasion of experience, arising in connection with each of the six sense faculties and their objects (MN 28.28). The Buddha's statement that the five aggregates are dukkha thus reveals that the very things we identify with and hold to as the basis for happiness, rightly seen, are the basis for the suffer-ing that we dread. Even when we feel ourselves comfortable and secure, the instability of the aggregates is itself a source of oppression and keeps us perpetually exposed to suffering in its more blatant forms. The whole situation becomes multiplied further to dimensions beyond calculation when we take into account the Buddha's disclosure of the fact of rebirth. All beings in whom ignorance and craving remain present wander on in the cycle of repeated existence, sarnsara, in which each turn brings them the suffering of new birth, ageing, illness, and death. All states of existence within samsara, being necessarily transitory and subject to change, are incapable of providing last-ing security. Life in any world is unstable, it is swept away, it has no shelter and protector, nothing of its own (MN 82.36). THE TEACHING OF NON-SELF Inextricably tied up with impermanence and suffering is a third principle intrinsic to all phenomena of existence. This is the characteristic of non-self (anatta), and the three together are called the three marks or characteristics (tilakkhaIJa). The Buddha"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"28 The Majjhima Niktiya teaches, contrary to our most cherished beliefs, that our person-ality -the five aggregates -cannot be identified as self, as an enduring and substantial ground of personal identity. The notion of self has only a conventional validity, as a convenient short-hand device for denoting a composite insubstantial situation. It does not signify any ultimate immutable entity subsisting at the core of our being. The bodily and mental factors are transitory phenomena, constantly arising and passing away, processes cre-ating the appearance of selfhood through their causal continuity and interdependent functioning. Nor does the Buddha posit a self outside and beyond the five aggregates. The notion of self-hood, treated as an ultimate, he regards as a product of igno-rance, and all the diverse attempts to substantiate this notion by identifying it with some aspect of the personality he describes as \"clinging to a doctrine of self.\" In several suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha gives forceful expression to his repudiation of views of self. In MN 102 he undertakes a far-reaching survey of the various propositions put forth about the self, declaring them all to be \"conditioned and gross.\" In MN 2.8 six views of self are branded as \"the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the contortion of views, the vacillation of views, the fetter of views.\" In MN 11 he compares his teaching point by point with those of other recluses and brahmins and shows that beneath their apparent similarities, they finally divefge on just this one crucial point -the rejection of views of self -which undermines the agree-ments. MN 22 offers a series of arguments agajnst the view\" of self, culminating in the Buddha's declaration that he does not see any doctrine of self that would not lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, -and despair. In his map of the steps to liberation, personality view (sakktiyaditthi), the positing of a self in relation to the five aggregates, is held to be the first fetter to be broken with the arising of the \"vision of the Dhamma.\" The principle of non-self is shown in the suttas to follow logi-cally from the two marks of impermanence and suffering. The standard formula states that what is impermanent is pain or suf-fering, and what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change cannot be regCl;rded as mine, I, or self (MN 22.26, MN 35.20, etc.). Other passages highlight the relationship among the three characteristics from different angles. MN 28 r L Introduction 29 points out that when the external physical elements -earth, water, fire, and air -vast as they are, are periodically destroyed in cosmic cataclysms, there can be no considering this transitory body as self. MN 148 demonstrates by a reductio ad absurdum argument that impermanence implies non-self: when all the fac-tors of being are clearly subject to rise and fall, to identify any-thing among them with self is to be left with the untenable thesis that self is subject to rise and fall. MN 35.19 connects the mark of non-self with that of dukkha by arguing that because we cannot bend the five aggregates to our will, they cannot be taken as mine, I, or self. THE ORIGIN AND CESSATION OF SUFFERING The second of the Four Noble Truths makes known the origin or cause of suffering, which the Buddha identifies as craving (ta1!hti) in its three aspects: craving for sensual pleasures; craving for being, that is, for continued existence; and craving for non-being, that is, for personal annihilation. The third truth states the converse of the second truth, that with the elimination of crav-ing the suffering that originates from it will cease without remainder. The Buddha's discovery of the causal link between craving and suffering accounts for the apparent \"pessimistic\" streak that emerges in several suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya: in MN 13 with its disquisition on the dangers in sensual pleasures, form, and feeling; in MN 10 and MN 119 with their cemetery medita-tions; in MN 22, MN 54, and MN 75 with their shocking similes for sensual pleasures. Such teachings are part of the Buddha's tactical approach to guiding his disciple? to liberation. By its own inherent nature craving springs up and thrives wherever it finds something that appears pleasant and delightful. It,prolifer-ates through mistaken perception -the perception of sense objects as enjoyable -and thus to break the grip of craving on the mind, exhortation is often not enough. The Buddha must make people see that the things they yearn for and frantically pursue are really suffering, and he does this by exposing the dangers concealed beneath their sweet and charming exteriors. Although the second and third noble truths have an immedi-ate psychological validity, they also have a deeper aspect"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"30 The Majjhima Nikttya brought to light in the suttas. The middle two truths as stated in the general formulation of the Four Noble Truths are actually telescoped versions of a longer formulation that discloses the origin and cessation of bondage in sarilsara. The doctrine in which this expanded version of the two truths is set forth is called paticca samuppada, dependent origination. In its fullest statement the doctrine spells out the origination and cessation of suffering in terms of twelve factors connected together in eleven propositions. This formulation, laid down schematically, will be found at :MN 38.17 in its order of arising and at :MN 38.20 in its order of ceasing. MN 115.11 includes both sequences together preceded by a statement of the general principle of conditionality that underlies the applied doctrine. A more elaborate version giving a factorial analysis of each term in the series is presented at MN 9.21-66, and a version exemplified in the course of an individual life at MN 38.26-40. Condensed versions are also found, notably 'at MN 1.171, :MN 11.16, and MN 75.24-25. The venerable Sariputta quotes the Buddha as saying that one who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma and one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent origination (MN 28.28). According to the usual interpretation, the series of twelve fac-tors extends over three lives and divides into causal and resul-tant phases. The gist of it can be briefly explained as follows. Because of ignorance (avijja) -defined as non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths - a person engages in volitional actions or kamma, which may be bodily, verbal, or mental, wholesome or unwholesome. These kammic actions are the formations (sankhara), and they ripen in states of consciousness (vififiaIJa) -first as the rebirth-consciousness at the moment of conception and thereafter as the passive states of consciousness resulting from kamma that matures in the course of a lifetime. Along with consciousness there arises mentality-materiality (namarupa), the psychophysical organism, which is equipped with the sixfold base (salayatana), the five physical sense faculties ru;td mind as the faculty of the higher cognitive functions. Via the sense facul-ties contact (phassa) takes place between consciousness and its objects, and contact conditions feeling (vedana). The links from consciousness through feeling are the products of past kamma, of the causal phase represented by ignorance and formations. With the next link the kammically active phase of the present • ,< Introduction 31 life begins, productive of a new existence in the future. Conditioned by feeling, craving (ta1Jha) arises, this being the sec-ond noble truth. When craving intensifies it gives rise to cling-ing (upadana), through which one again engages in volitional actions pregnant with a renewal of existence (bhava). The new existence begins with birth (jati), which inevitably leads to ageing and death (jaramaraIJa). The teaching of dependent origination also shows how the round of existence can be broken. With the arising of true knowledge, full penetration of the Four Noble Truths, ignorance is eradicated. Consequently the mind no longer indulges in craving and clinging, action loses its potential to generate rebirth, and deprived thus of its fuel, the round comes to an end. (, This marks the goal of the teaching signalled. by the third noble truth, the cessation of suffering. NIBBANA The state that supervenes when ignorance and craving have been uprooted is called Nibbana (Sanskrit, NirvaIJa), and no con-ception in the Buddha's teaching has proved so refractory to conceptual pinning down as this one. In a way such elusiveness is only to be expected, since Nibbana is described precisely as \"profound, hard to see and hard to understand, ... unattainable by mere reasoning\" (MN 26.19). Yet in this same passage the Buddha also says that Nibbana is to be experienced by the wise and in the suttas he gives enough indications of its nature to convey some idea of its desirability. The Pali Canon offers sufficient evidence to dispense with the opinion of some interpreters that Nibbana is'sheer annihilation; even the more sophisticated view that Nibbana is merely the destruction of defilements and the extinction of existence cannot stand up under scrutiny. Probably the most compelling testi-mony against that view is the well-known passage from the Udana that declares with reference to Nibbana that \"there is an \" unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned,\" the existence of which makes possible \"escape from the born, become, made, and conditioned\" (Ud 8:3/80). The Majjhima Nikaya characteris-es Nibbana in similar ways. It is \"the unborn, unageing, unail-ing, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled supreme security from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"32 The Majjhima Nikaya bondage,\" which the Buddha attained to on the night of his enlightenment (MN 26.18). Its pre-eminent reality is affirmed by., the Buddha when he calls Nibbana the supreme foundation of , truth, whose nature is undeceptive and which ranks as the supreme noble truth (MN 140.26). Nibbana cannot be perceived I by those who live in lust and hate, but it can be seen with the arising of spiritual vision, and by fixing the mind upon it in the depths of meditation, the disciple can attain the destruction of the taints (MN 26.19, MN 75.24, MN 64.9). The Buddha does not devote many words to a philosophical definition of Nibbana. One reason is that Nibbana, being uncon-ditioned, transcendent, and supra mundane, does not easily lend itself to definition in terms of concepts that are inescapably tied ! to the conditioned, manifest, and mundane. Another is that the Buddha's objective is the practical one of leading beings to release from suffering, and thus his principal approach to the characterisation of Nibbana is to inspire the incentive to attain it and to show what must be done to accomplish this. To show Nibbana as desirable, as the aim of striving, he describes it as the highest bliss, as the supreme state of sublime peace, as the ageless, deathless, and sorrowless, as the supreme security from bondage. To show what must be done to attain Nibbana, to indi-cate that the goal implies a definite task, he describes it as the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, i the destruction of craving, dispassion (MN 26.19). Above all, Nibbana is the cessation of suffering, and for those who seek an end to suffering such a designation is enough to beckon them , towards the path. THE WAY TO THE CESSATION OF SUFFERING The fourth noble truth completes the pattern established by the first three truths by revealing the means to eliminate crav-ing and thereby bring an end to suffering. This truth teaches ' the \"Middle Way\" discovered by the Budd~a, the Noble Eightfold Path: 1. right view (sammli ditthi) 2. right intention (sammil sankappa) 3. right speech (sammli Vilca) \"\";. ... Introduction 33 4. right action (sammli kammanta) 5. right livelihood (sammli lifiva) 6. right effort (sammli vliylima) 7. right mindfulness (sammli sati) 8. right concentration (sammil samlidhi) Mentioned countless times throughout the Majjhima Nikaya, the Noble Eightfold Path is explained in detail in two full suttas. MN 141 gives a factorial analysis of the eight components of the path using the definitions that are standard in the Pali Canon; MN 117 expounds the path from a different angle under the rubric of \"noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites.\" The Buddha there makes the important distinction between the mundane and supramundane stages of the path, defines the first five factors for both stages, and shows how the path factors function in unison in the common task of providing an outlet from suffering. Other suttas explore in greater detail individual components of the path. Thus MN 9 provides an in-depth exposition of right view, MN 10 of right mindfulness, MN 19 of right intention. MN 44.11 explains that the eight fac-tors can be incorporated into three \"aggregates\" of training. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood make up the aggregate of virtue or moral disciplirie (sfla); right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration make up the aggregate of concentration (samildhi); and right view and right intention make up the aggregate of understanding or wisdom (panna). This threefold sequence in turn serves as the basic outline for the gradual training, to be discussed later. In the Pali Canon the practices conducing to Nibbana are often elaborated into a more complex set comprising seven groups of intersecting factors. The later tradition designates them the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma), but the Buddha himself simply speaks of them without a collec-tive name as \"the things that I have taught you ,after directly knowing them\" (MN 103.3, MN 104.5). Towards the end of his life he stressed to the Sangha that the long duration of his teach-ing in the world depends upon the accurate preservation of these factors and their being practised by his followers in har-mony, free from contention."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34 The Majjhima Nikilya The constituents of this set are as follows: • the four foundations of mindfulness (satipatthana) • the four right kinds of striving (sammappadhana) • the four bases for spiritual power (iddhipada) • the five faculties (indriya) • the five powers (baZa) • the seven enlightenment factors (bojjhanga) • the Noble Eightfold Path (ariya atthangika magga) Each group is defined in full at MN 77.15-21. As examination will show, most of these groups are simply subdivisions or rearrangements of factors of the eightfold path made to high-light different aspects of the practice. Thus, for example, the four foundations of mindfulness are an elaboration of right mindful-ness; the four right kinds of striving, an elaboration of right effort. The development of the groups is therefore integral and not sequential. MN 118, for example, shows how the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness fulfils the development of the seven enlightenment factors, and MN 149.10 states that one engaged in insight meditation on the senses brings to maturity all thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment. Factorial analysis of the thirty-seven requisites of enlighten-ment brings to light the central importance of four factors among them - energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. From this a clear picture of the essential practice can be sketched. One begins with a conceptual understanding of the Dhamma and an intention to' achieve the goal, the first two path factors. Then, out of faith, one accepts the moral discipline regu-lating speech, action, and livelihood. With virtue as a basis one energetically applies the mind to cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness. As mindfulness matures it issues in deepened concentration, and the concentrated mind, by investigation, arrives at wisdom, a penetrative understanding of the principles originally grasped only conceptually. THEGRADUALTRA~G In the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkha), which unfolds in stages from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training r , i '--Introduction 35 is a finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into virtue, concentration, and wisdom. Invariably in the suttas the sequence on the gradual training is shown to start with the going forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of the monastic life in the Buddha's Dispensation. In principle the entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four supramundane stages (MN 68.18-23; MN 73.9-22; the Theravadin position is that lay followers can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but having done so they immediately seek the going forth or pass away). However, the fact remains that the household life inevitably tends to impede the single-hearted quest for deliverance by fostering a multitude of worldly concerns and personal attachments. Hence the Buddha himself went forth into homelessness as the preliminary step in his own noble quest, and after his enlightenment he established the Sangha, the order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunIs, as the resort for those who wish to devote themselves fully to the practice of his teaching undeflected by the cares of hQusehold life. The main paradigm for the gradual training found in the Majjhima Nikaya is that laid out in MN 27 and MN 51; alterna-tive versions are found at MN 38, MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, and MN 125, and some of the more important variations will be briefly noted. The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathagata in the world and his exposition of the Dhamma, hear-ing which the disciple acquires faith and follows the Teacher into homelessness. Having gone forth, he undertakes and observes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of conduct and livelihood. The next three steps -contentment, restraint of the sense faculties, and mindfulness and full aware-ness - are intended to internalise the process of purification and thereby bridge the transition from virtue to concentration. Alternative versions (MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, MN 125) insert two additional steps here, moderation in eating and devotion to wakefulness. The direct training in concentration comes to prominence in the section on the abandonment of the five hindrances. The five"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"36 The Majjhima Nikllya hindrances -sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restless-ness and remorse, and doubt - are the primary obstacles to med-itative development and their removal is therefore essential for the mind to be brought to a state of calm and unification. In the sequence on the gradual training the overcoming of the hin-drances is treated only schematically; other parts of the Canon provide more practical instruction, amplified still more in the commentaries. The passage on the hindrances is graced in MN 39 by a series of similes illustrating the contrast between the bondage imposed by the hindrances and the joyful sense of free-dom that is won when they are abandoned. The next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhiinas, profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully absorbed in its object. The Buddha enumerates four jhanas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor. The jhanas are always described by the same formulas, which in sev-eral suttas (MN 39, MN 77, MN 119) are augmented by similes of great beauty. Although in the Theravada tradition the jhanas are not regarded as indispensable to the attainment of enlighten-ment, the Buddha invariably includes them in the full gradual training because of the contribution they make to the intrinsic perfection of the path and because the deep concentration they induce provides a solid base for the cultivation of insight. While still mundane the jhanas are the \"footsteps of the Tathagata\" (MN 27.19-22) and foretokens of the bliss of Nibbana that lies at the training's end. ' From the fourth jhana three alternative lines of further devel-opment become possible. In a number of passages outside the sequence on the gradual training (MN 8, MN 25, MN 26, MN 66, etc.) the Buddha mentions four meditative states that c'ontinue the mental unification established by the jhanas. These states, described as \"the liberations that are peaceful and immaterial,\" are, like the jhanas, also mundane. Distinguished from the jhanas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that forms the object in the jhanas, they are named after their own exalted objects: the base of infinite space, the base of infinite conscious-ness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. In the Pali commentaries these states came to be called the immaterial or formless jhanas (arupajjhiina). r , I L Introduction 37 A second line of development disclosed by the suttas is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge. The Buddha frequent~y mentions six types as a group, which come to be called the SlX kinds of direct knowledge (chalabhififiii; the expression does not occur in the Majjhima). The last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is supramundane and thus properly belongs to the third line of development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful degree of mental concentration achieved in the fourth jhana: the super-normal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the divine eye (MN 6, MN 73, MN 77, MN 108). The jhanas and the mundane types of direct knowledge by themselves dQ not issue in enlightenment and liberation. As lofty and peaceful as these attainments are, they can only sup-press the defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them. To uproot the defilements at the most fundamen-tal level, and thereby yield the fruits of enlightenment and deliverance, the meditative process must be redirected along a third line of development, one which does not necessarily pre-suppose the former two. This is the contemplation of \"things as they actually are,\" which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship. This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the sequence on the gradual training, though he precedes it by descriptions of two of the direct knowledges, the recollection of past lives and the divine eye. The three together, which figured prominently in the Buddha's own enlightenment (MN 4.27-30), are collectively called the three true knowledges (tevijjii). Although the first two among these are not essential to the reali-sation of arahantship, we may assume that the Buddha includes them here because they reveal the truly vast and profound dimensions of suffering in samsara and thereby prepare the mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths, in which that \"suffering is diagnosed and surmounted. The process of contemplation by which the meditator devel-ops insight is not explicitly shown as such in the sequence on the gradual training. It is only implied by the exhibiting of its final fruit, here called the knowledge of the destruction of the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"38 The Majjhima Nikaya taints. The asavas or taints are a classification of defilements con-sidered in their role of sustaining the samsaric round. The commentaries derive the word from a root su meaning \"to flow.\" Scholars differ as to whether the flow implied by the pre-fix a is inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as \"influxes\" or \"influences,\" others as \"outflows\" or \"effluents.\" A stock passage in the suttas indicates the term's real signifi-cance independently of etymology when it describes the asavas as states \"that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death\" (MN 36.47, etc.). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, have rendered it \"cankers,\" \"corruptions,\" or \"taints,\" the latter being the choice of Yen. Na:r:tamoli. The three taints mentioned in the suttas are virtual synonyms for craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and the ignorance that appears at the head of the formula for dependent origination. When the disciple's mind has been liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of arahantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion's roar: \"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" APPROACHES TO MEDn'A nON The methods of meditation taught by the Buddha in the Pali Canon fall into two broad systems. One is the development of serenity (samatha), which 'aims at concentration (samadhi); the other is the development of insight (vipassana), which aims at understanding or wisdom (panna). In the Buddha's system of mental training the role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of samsaric bondage. The attainments possible through serenity meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages under his early teachers but found that they only led to higher planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15-16). However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of con-centration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha incor-porated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting r I j I Introduction 39 levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a foundation and preparation for insight and as a \"pleasant abid-ing here and now.\" The attainments reached by the practice of serenity meditation are, as mentioned in the preceding section, the eight absorptions - the four jhanas and the four immaterial states - each of which serves as the basis for the next. Strangely, the suttas do not explicitly prescribe specific meditation subjects as the means for attaining the jhanas, but the commentarialliterature such.as the Visuddhimagga enables us to make the connections. Among the meditation topics enumerated in the suttas, eight of the ten kasi/:zas (MN 77.24) are recognised as suitable for attaining all four jhanas, the last two being the respective supports for the first two immaterial attainments. The eight bases for transcendence seem to be a more finely differentiated treatment of meditation on the colour kasiI~as, as are the first three of the eight liberations (MN 77.22-23). Mindfulness of breathing, to which the Buddha devotes an entire sutta (MN 118), provides an ever accessible meditation subject that can be pursued through all four jhanas and also used to develop insight. Another method for attaining the jhanas mentioned in the suttas is the four divine abodes (brahmavihara) -boundless loving-kindness, compassion, appre-ciative joy (i.e., gladness at others' success), and equanimity (MN 7, MN 40, etc.). Tradition holds the first tllree to be capable of leading to the three lower jhanas, the last of inducing the fourth jhana. The immaterial attainments are to be reached by fixing the mind on the specific object of each attainment - infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and the state that can only be described as neither percipient nor as non-percipient. Whereas in serenity meditation the meditator attempts to focus upon a single uniform object abstracted from actual expe-rience, in insight meditation the endeavour is made to contem-plate, from a position of detached observation, the ever-shifting flux of experience itself in order to penetrate through to the essential nature of bodily and mental phenomena. The Buddha , teaches that the craving and clinging that hold us in bondage are sustained by a network of \"conceivings\" (mannita) -deluded Views, conceits, and suppositions that the mind fabricates by an internal process of mental commentary or \"proliferation\" (papanca) and then projects out upon .the world, taking them to"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"40 The Majjhima Nikilya possess objective validity. The task of insight meditation is to sever our attachments by enabling us to pierce through this net of conceptual projections in order to see things as they really are. To see things as they really are means to see them in terms of the three characteristics - as impermanent, as painful or suffer-ing, and as not self. Since the three characteristics are closely interlinked, anyone of them can be made the main portal for entering the domain of insight, but the Buddha's usual approach is to show all three together -impermanence implying suffering and the two in conjunction implying the absence of self. When the noble disciple sees all the factors of being as stamped with these three marks, he no longer identifies with them, no longer appropriates them by taking them to be mine, 1, or self. Seeing thus, he becomes disenchanted with all forma-tions. When he becomes disenchanted, his lust and attachment fade away and his mind is liberated from the taints. Instructions for the development of insight in the Majjhima Nikaya, though concise, are many and diverse. The single most important lesson on the practice conducing to insight is the Satipatthilna Sutta, the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness (MN 10; also found in the DIgha Nikaya with an amplified section on the Four Noble Truths). The sutta sets forth a comprehensive system called satipatthana designed to train the mind to see with microscopic precision the true nature of the body, feelings, states of mind, and mental objects. The system is sometimes taken to be the ,paradigm for the practice of \"bare insight\" -the direct contemplation of mental and bodily phe-nomena without a prior foundation of jhana -and, while several exercises described in the sutta can also lead to the jhanas, the arousing of insight is clearly the intent of the method. Other suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya describe approaches to developing insight that either elaborate upon the satipatthilna contemplations or reach them from a different starting point. Thus MN 118 shows how the practice of mindfulness of breath-ing fulfils all four foundations of mindfulness, not the first alone as shown in MN 10. Several suttas -MN 28, MN 62, MN 140-present more detailed instructions on the contemplation of the elements. MN 37, MN 74, and MN 140 contain illuminating pas-sages on the contemplation of feeling. In some suttas the Buddha uses the five aggregates as the groundwork for insight Introduction 41 contemplation (e.g., MN 22, MN 109); in some, the six sense bases (e.g., MN 137, MN 148, MN 149); in some, the two com-bined (MN 147). MN 112 has sections dealing with insight based on the five aggregates, the six elements, and the six sense bases, and as resulting from the gradual training. MN 52 and MN 64 show that insight can also be aroused with the jhanas, the imma-terial attainments, and the divine abodes as its objects: the disci-ple enters any of these states and co~te.mplates its constituent factors as subject to the three charactenstIcs. Several sequences of meditative states mentioned in the Majjhima culminate in an attainment called the cessation of per-ception and feeling (safifiilvedayitanirodha). Although this state always follows the last immaterial attainment, it is not, as ma~ be supposed, merely one higher step in the scale of concentratlOn. Strictly speaking, the attainment of cessation pertains neither to serenity nor to insight. It is a state reached by the combined pow-ers of serenity and insight in which all mental processes are tem-porarily suspended. The attainment is said to be accessible only to non-returners and arahants who have also mastered the jhanas and immaterial states. Detailed canonical discussions of it are found in MN 43 and MN 44. THE FOUR PLANES OF LIBERA nON The practice of the Buddhist path evolves in two distinct stages, a mundane (lokiya) or preparatory stage and a supramundane (lokuttara) or consummate stage. The mundane path is devel-oped when the disciple undertakes the gradual training in virtue, concentration, and wisdom. This reaches its peak in the practice of insight meditation, which deepens direct experience of the three characteristics of existence. When the practitioner's faculties have arrived at an adequate degree of maturity, the mundane path gives birth to the supramundane path, so called because it leads directly and infallibly out of (uttara) the world .. (ioka) comprising the three realms of existence to the attainment of \"the deathless element,\" Nibbana. Progress along the supramundane path is marked by four major breakthroughs, each of which ushers the disciple through two subordinate phases called the path (magga) and its fruit (phala). The phase of path has the special function of eliminating"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"42 The Majjhima Nikaya a determinate number of defilements to which it is directly opposed, the mental impediments that hold us in bondage to the round of rebirths. When the work of the path has been com-pleted, the disciple realises its corresponding fruit, the degree of liberation made accessible by that particular path. The canonical formula of homage to the Sangha refers obliquely to these four planes of liberation -each with its phase of path and fruit -when it extols the Blessed One's community of noble disciples as comprising \"the four pairs of persons, the eight types of indi-viduals\" (MN 7.7). These four pairs are obtained by taking, for each stage, the one who has entered upon the way to realisation of the fruit and the one who has attained the fruit. In the suttas the Buddha highlights the specific characteristics of each supramundane stage in two ways: by mentioning the defilements that are abandoned on each plane and the conse-quences its attainment bears on the process of rebirth (see, e.g., MN 6.11-13,19; MN 22.42-45, etc.). He handles the elimination of the defilements by classifying these into a tenfold group called the ten fetters (samyojana). The disciple enters upon the first supramundane path either as a Dhamma-follower (dhammanusarin) or as a faith-follower (saddhanusarin); the former is one in whom wisdom is the dominant faculty, the latter one who progresses by the impetus of faith. This path, the path of stream-entry, has the task of eradicating the grossest three fetters: personality view, i.e., the view of a self among the five aggre-gates; doubt in the Buddl)a and his teaching; and adherence to external rules and observances, either ritualistic or ascetic, in the belief that they can bring purification~ When the disciple realises the fruit of this path he becomes a stream-enterer (sotapanna), who has entered the \"stream\" of the Noble Eightfold Path that will carry him irreversibly to Nibbana. The stream-enterer is bound to reach final liberation in a maximum of seven more births, which all occur either in the human world or in the heavenly realms. The second supramundane path attenuates to a still greater degree the root defilements of lust, hatred, and delusion, though without yet eradicating them. On realising the fruit of this path the disciple becomes a once-returner (sakadagamin), who is due to return to this world (i.e., the sense-sphere realm) only one more time and then make an end of suffering. The third path eradicates the next two fetters, sensual desire and ill will; it i , Introduction 43 issues in the fruit of the non-returner (anagamin), who is due to reappear by spontaneous birth in one of the special celestial realms called the Pure Abodes, and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world. The fourth and last supramundane path is the path of ara-hantship. This path eradicates the five higher fetters: desire for rebirth in the fine-material realm and in the immaterial realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. By realisation of the fruit of this path the practitioner becomes an arahant, a fully liberated one, who \"here and now enters upon and abides in the deliver-ance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.\" The arahant will be discussed fur-ther in the next section. The commentaries (often referred to in the notes to this trans-lation) develop an interpretation of the paths and fruits based upon the systemisation of the Buddha's teachings known as the Abhidhamma. Drawing upon the Abhidhamma depiction of the mind as a sequence of discrete momentary acts of conscious-ness, called cittas, the commentaries understand each supra-mundane path to be a single occasion of consciousness arising at the climax of a series of insights into the Dhamma. Each of the four momentary path cittas eliminates its own fixed set of defile-ments, to be followed immediately by its fruition, which consists of a string of momentary cittas that enjoy the bliss of Nibbana made accessible by the breakthrough of the path. Though this conception of the paths and fruits is regularly employed by the commentators as an hermeneutical tool for interpreting the sut-tas, it is not explicitly formulated as such in the old Nikayas and at times there even appears to be a tension between the two (for example, in the passage at MN 142.5 describing the four persons on the path as distinct recipients of offerings). THE ARAHANT The ideal figure of the Majjhima Nikaya, as of the Pali Canon as 'whole, is the arahant. The word \"arahant\" itself derives from a root meaning \"to be worthy.\" Yen. NaI:\\amoli renders it \"accom-plished\" and \"Accomplished One\" when it is used as an epithet of the Buddha, probably to be consistent with his practice of translating all the Buddha's epithets. In its other occurrences he"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"44 The Majjhima Nikliya leaves it untranslated. The word seems to have been of pre-Buddhist coinage but was taken over by the Buddha to desig-nate the individual who has reached the final fruit of the path. The suttas employ a stock description of the arahant that summarises his accomplishments: he is \"one with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge\" (MN LSI, etc.). Variant descriptions emphasise dif-ferent aspects of the arahant's attainment. Thus one sutta offers a series of metaphorical epithets that the Buddha himself inter-prets as representing the arahant's abandoning of ignorance, craving, and conceit, his eradication of fetters, and his freedom from the round of births (MN 22.30-35). Elsewhere the Buddha ascribes a different set of epithets to the arahant -several of brahmanical currency -deriving these terms by imaginative ety-mology from the arahant's elimination of all evil unwholesome states (MN 39.22-29). The Majjhima records differences of type among the arahants, which are ascribed to the diversity in their faculties. In MN 70 the Buddha introduces a basic distinction between those ara-hants who are \"liberated-in-both-ways\" and those who are \"liberated-by-wisdom\", whereas the former are capable of abid-ing in the immaterial attainments, the latter lack that capacity. Arahants are further distinguished as those who possess, besides the knowledge of the destruction of the taints necessary to all arahants, all three of the true knowledges and all six of the direct knowledges. In MN 108 the venerable Ananda indicates that those arahants who possessed the six direct knowledges were accorded special veneration and authority in the Sangha following the Buddha's passing away. Beneath these incidental differences, however, all arahants alike share the same essential accomplishments - the destruction of all defilements and the freedom from future rebirths. They possess three unsurpassable qualities -unsurpassable vision, unsurpassable practice of the way, and unsurpassable deliver-ance (MN 35.26). They are endowed with the ten factors of one beyond training - the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path augmented by right knowledge and right deliverance (MN 65.34, MN 78.14). They possess the four foundations - the Introduction 45 foundations of wisdom, of truth, of relinquishment, and of eace (MN 140.11). And by the eradication of lust, hate, and p . d't t' delusion all arahants have access to a umque me I a lve attainment called the fruition attainment of arahantship, described as the unshakeable deliverance of mind, the immea-surable deliverance of mind, the void deliverance of mind, the deliverance of mind through nothingness, and the signless deliverance of mind (MN 43.35-37). KAMMA AND REBIRTH According to the Buddha's teaching, all beings except the ara-hants are subject to \"renewal of being in the future\" (punabbhava), that is, to rebirth. Rebirth, in the Buddhist conception, is not the transmigration of a self or soul but the continuation of a process, a flux of becoming in which successive lives are linked together by causal transmission of influence rather than by substantial identity. The basic causal pattern underlying the process is that defined by the teaching of dependent origination (see above, pp. 30-31), which also demonstrates how rebirth is possible without a reincarnating self. The process of rebirth, the Buddha teaches, exhibits a definite lawfulness essentially ethical in character. This ethical character is established by the fundamental dynamism that determines the states into which beings are reborn and the circumstances they encounter in the course of their lives. That dynamism is kamma, volitional action of body, speech, and mind. Those beings who engage in bad actions - actions motivated by the three unwholesome roots of greed, hate, and delusion - generate unwholesome kamma that leads them to rebirth into lower states of existence and, if it ripens in the human world, brings them pain and misfortune. Those beings who engage in good actions -actions motivated by the three wholesome roots of non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion -generate wholesome kamma that leads them to higher states of existence and ripens in the human world as pleasure and good fortune. Because the deeds a person performs in the course of a single life can be extremely varied, the type of rebirth that lies ahead of him can be very unpredictable, as the Buddha shows in MN 136. But despite this empirical variability, an invariable law governs the L"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"46 The Majjhima Nikaya direct relationship between types of actions and the types of results they yield, the basic correlations being sketched by the Buddha in MN 57 and laid out in greater detail in MN 135. In several suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha refers to various planes of existence into which rebirth can occur and he also gives some indication of the types of kamma that lead to those planes. This cosmological typography is not, from the Buddhist standpoint, the product of conjecture or fantasy but a matter directly known to the Buddha through his \"Tathagata's powers of knowledge\" (MN 12.36); to some extent the process is also verifiable by those who gain the divine eye (e.g., MN 39.20). A brief overview may be given here of the planes of rebirth recog-nised in Buddhist cosmology and of their kammic antecedents, as systematised in the developed Theravada tradition. The Buddhist cosmos is divided into three broad realms -the sense-sphere realm, the fine-material realm, and the immaterial realm. Each of these comprises a range of subsidiary planes, amounting to a total of thirty-one planes of existence. The sense-sphere realm, so called because sensual desire pre-dominates there, consists of eleven planes divided into two groups, the bad destinations and the good destinations. The bad destinations or \"states of deprivation\" (apaya) are four in num-ber: the hells, which are states of intense torment as described in MN 129 and MN 130; the animal kingdom; the sphere of ghosts (peta), beings afflicted with incessant hunger and thirst; and the sphere of titans (asura), beings involved in constant combat (not mentioned as a separate plane in the Majjhima). The courses of kamma leading to rebirth into these planes are classified into a set of ten -three of body, four of speech, and three of mind. These are enumerated briefly at MN 9.4 and explicated in MN 41. Gradations in the gravity of the evil intentions responsi-ble for these deeds account for specific differences in the mode of rebirth resulting from such actions. The good destinations in the sense-sphere realm are the human world and the heavenly planes. The latter are sixfold: the gods under the Four Great Kings; the gods of the Thirty-three (tiivatimsa), who are presided over by Sakka, a Buddhist meta-morphosis of Indra, depicted as a devotee of the Buddha, faith-ful, but prone to negligence (MN 37); the Yama gods; the gods of the Tusita heaven, the abode of the Bodhisatta before his final L Introduction 47 birth (MN 123); the gods who delight in creating; and the gods who wield power over others' creations. The last is ~aid to. be the abode of Mara, the Tempter in Buddhism, who beSIdes bemg a symbol for Desire and Death, is also regarded as a powerful deity with evil designs, keen to prevent beings from escaping the net of samsara. The kammic cause for rebirth into the good destinations of the sense-sphere realm is the practice of the ten courses of wholesome action, defined at MN 9.8 and in MN 41. In the fine-material realm the grosser types of matter are absent and the bliss, power, luminosity, and vitality of its denizens are far superior to those in the sense-sphere realm. The fine-material realm consists of sixteen planes, which are the objective counterparts of the four jhanas. Attainment of t~~ first jhana leads to rebirth among Brahma's Assembly, the Mmls~e~s of Brahma and the Maha Brahmas, according to whether It IS developed to an inferior, middling, or superior degree. Baka the Brahma (MN 49) and Brahma Sahampati (MN 26, MN 67) seem to be residents of the last-named plane. The suttas mention espe-cially the divine abodes as the path to the company of Brahma (MN 99.24-27). Attainment of the second jhana in the sam~ ~ee degrees leads respectively to rebirth among the gods of LIml.ted Radiance, of Immeasurable Radiance, and of Streammg Radiance; the third jhana to rebirth among the gods of Limited Glory, of Immeasurable Glory, and of Refulgent Glory. The fourth jhana ordinarily leads to rebirth among the gods of Great Fruit, but if it is developed with a desire to attain an insentient mode of existence, it will conduce to rebirth among the non-percipient beings, for whom consciousne~s is . tempor~ri1y sus-pended. The fine-material realm also con tams fIve speCIal planes that are exclusively for the rebirth of non-returners. These are the Pure Abodes -the Aviha, the Atappa, the Sudassa, the SudassI, and the Akanittha. In each of these planes in the fine-material realm the lifespan is said to be of enormous duration and to increase Significantly in each higher plane. The third realm of being is the immaterial realm, where matter has become n0'iexistent and only mental processes exist. This realm consist of four planes, which are the objective counterparts of the fo r immaterial meditative attainments, from which they result and whose names they share: the bases of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"48 The Majjhima Nikaya and. nei ther-perception-nor-non-perception. The lifespans ascnbed to them are respectively 20,000; 40,000; 60,000; and 84,000 great aeons. In Buddhist cosmology existence in every realm, being the product of a kamma with a finite potency, is necessarily imper-manent. Beings take rebirth in accordance with their deeds, experience the good or bad results, and then, when the genera-tive kamma has spent its force, they pass away to take rebirth elsewhere as determined by still another kamma that has found the opportunity to ripen. Hence the torments of hell as well as the bliss of heaven, no matter how long they may last, are bound to p~ss. For t.his reason the Buddha does not locate the final goal of hIS teachmg anywhere within the conditioned world. He guides those whose spiritual faculties are still tender to aspire for a heavenly rebirth and teaches them the lines of conduct that conduce to the fulfilment of their aspirations (MN 41, MN 120). But f~r those whose faculties are mature and who can grasp the m:-satlsfactory nature of everything conditioned, he urges deter-mmed effort to put an end to wandering in sarilsara and to reach Nibbana, which transcends all planes of being. THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES The Middle Country of India in which the Buddha lived and taught in the fifth century B.C. teemed with a luxuriant variety of religious and philosophi<;al beliefs propagated by teachers equally varied in their ways of life. The main division was into the brahmins and the non-brahmanic ascetics, the samarJas or \"recluses.\" The brahmins were the hereditary priesthood of India, the custodians of the ancient orthodoxy. They accepted the authority of the Vedas, which they studied, chanted at countless rituals, sacrifices, and ceremonies, and turned to as the source of their philosophical speculations. Thus they are charac-terised in the suttas as traditionalists (anussavika), who teach their doctrines on the basis of oral tradition (MN 100.7). The Pali Canon generally depicts them as living a comfortably settled life, as marrying and begetting progeny, and in some cases as enjoying royal patronage. The more learned among them gath-ered a company of students - all necessarily of brahmin birth -to whom they taught the Vedic hymns. • Introduction 49 The samanas on the other hand, did not accept the authority of the Veda~, f~r which reason from the perspective of the brah-mins they stood in the ranks of heterodoxy. They were usually celibate, lived a life of mendicancy, and acquired their status by voluntary renunciation rather than by birth. The samat:\\as roamed the Indian countryside sometimes in company, some-times as solitaries, preaching their doctrines to the populace, debating with other ascetics, engaging in their spiritual prac-tices, which often involved severe austerities (see MN 51.8) . Some teachers in the samaI)a camp taught entirely on the basis of reasoning and speculation, while others taught on the basis of their experiences in meditation. The Buddha placed himself among the latter, as one who teaches a Dhamma that he has directly known for himself (MN 100.7). The Buddha's encounters with brahmins were usually friend-ly, their conversations marked by courtesy and mutual reg~rd. Several suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya concern the brahmms' claim to superiority over those in other social classes. In the Buddha's age the caste system was only beginning to take shape in northeast India and had not yet spawned the countless subdivisions and rigid regulations that were to manacle Indian society through the centuries. Society was divided into four broad social classes: the brahmins, who performed the priestly functions; the khattiyas, the nobles, warriors, and administrators; the vessas, the merchants and agriculturalists; and the suddas, the menials and serfs. From the Pali suttas it appears that the brah-mins, while vested with authority in religious matters, had not yet risen to the position of unchallengeable hegemony they were to gain after the promulgation of the Laws of Manu. They had, however, already embarked on their drive for domination and did so by propagating the thesis that brahmins are the highest caste, the fairest caste, the divinely blessed offspring of Braluna who are alone capable of purification. Anxiety that this claim of the brahmins might actually be true seems to have spread among the royalty, who must have been fearful of the threat it posed to their own power (see MN 84.4, MN 90.9-10). Contrary to certain popular notions, the Buddha did not explic-itly repudiate the. clas~ diV~ of. In? ian society or appeal for the abolition of this SOCIal system. WIthin the Sangha, however, all caste distinctions were abrogated from the moment of ordination."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"50 The Majjhima Nikliya Thus people from any of the four castes who went forth under the Buddha renounced their class titles and prerogatives and instead became known simply as disciples of the Sakyan son (see Ud 5:5/55). Whenever the Buddha or his disciples were confronted with the brahmins' claim to superiority, they argued vigorously against them, maintaining that all such claims were groundless. Purification, they contended, was the result of con-duct, not of birth, and was thus accessible to those of all four castes (MN 40.13-14, MN 84, MN 90.12, MN 93). The Buddha even stripped the term ''brahmin'' of its hereditary accretions, and hearkening back to its original connotation of holy man, he defined the true brahmin as the arahant (MN 98). Those among the brahmins who were not yet hampered by class prejudice responded appreciatively to the Buddha's teaching. Some of the most eminent brahmins of t.11e time, in whom there still burned the ancient Vedic yearning for light, knowledge, and truth, recog-nised in the Buddha the All-Enlightened One for whom they longed and declared themselves his disciples (see especially MN 91.34). Several even renounced their class privileges and with their retinues entered the Sangha (MN 7.22, MN 92.15-24). The samaDas were a much more diversified group which, lacking a common scriptural authority, promulgated a plethora of philosophical doctrines ranging from the diabolical to the superdivine. The Pali Canon frequently mentions six teachers in particular as contemporaries of the Buddha, and as they are each described as \"the head.of an order ... regarded by many as a saint\" (MN 77.5), they must have been quite influential at the time. The Majjhima Nikaya mentions both the set of six and, separately, states their individual doctrines; it does not, however, correlate the names with the doctrines. The connections between names and doctrines are made in the Samannaphala Sutta of the Drgha Nikaya. PuraDa Kassapa, who is always mentioned first in the list, taught a doctrine of inaction (akiriyavada) that denied the validi-ty of moral distinctions (MN 60.13, MN 76.10). Makkhali Gosala was the leader of the sect known as the AjIvakas (or AjIvikas), which survived in India down into the medieval period. He taught a doctrine of fatalism that denied causality (ahetukavada) and claimed that the entire cosmic process is rigidly controlled by a principle called fate or destiny (niyati); beings have no Introduction 51 volitional control over their actions but move helplessly caught in the grip of fate (MN 60.21, MN 76.13). Ajita Kesakambalin was a moral nihilist (natthikavada) who propounded a material-ist philosophy that rejected the existence of an afterlife and kammic retribution (MN 60.5, MN 76.7); his doctrine is always cited by the Buddha as the paradigmatic instance of wrong view among the unwholesome courses of action. Pakudha Kaccayana advocated an atomism on the basis of which he repudiated the basic tenets of morality (MN 76.16). Safijaya Belatthiputta, a sceptic, refused to take a stand on the crucial moral and philosophical issues of the day, probably claiming that such knowledge was beyond our capacity for verification (MN 76.30). The sixth teacher, the NigaDtha Nataputta, is iden-tified with Mahavlra, the historical progenitor of Jainism. He taught that there exists a plurality of monadic souls entrapped in matter by the bonds of past kamma and that the soul is to be liberated by exhausting its kammic bonds through the practice of severe self-mortification. Whereas the Pali suttas are generally cordial but critical towards the brahmins, they are trencl1ant in their rejection of the rival doc-trines of the sam~as. In one sutta (MN 60) the Buddha contends that the firm adoption of any of the first three doctrines (and by implication the fourth) entails a chain of unwholesome states gen-erating evil kamma strong enough to bring a descent into the lower realms. Similarly the venerable Ananda describes these views as four \"negations of the holy life\" (MN 76). The scepticism of Safijaya, while not regarded as so pernicious, is taken as an indi-cation of its proponent's dullness and confusion; it is described as \"eel-wriggling\" (amaravikkhepa) because of its evasiveness and classified among the types of holy life that are without consolation (MN 76.30-31). The Jain doctrine, though sharing certain similari-ties with the Buddha's teaching, was held to be sufficiently mistaken in basic assumptions as to call for refutation, which the Buddha undertook on several occasions (MN 14, MN 56, MN 101). The repudiation of these erroneous views was seen, from the Buddhist perspective, to be a necessary measure not only to sound a clear warning against tenets that were4ritually detrimental, but also to cut away the obstacles agai1'Gt the acceptance of right view, which as the forerunner of the Buddha's path (MN 117.4) was a prerequisite to progress along the road to final deliverance."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"52 The Majjhima Niktiya TECHNICAL NOTES There remain to be discussed only a few technical points con-cerning this translation: first a general problem inevitably facing any translator from the Pali Canon, then certain changes that have been made in Yen. Na:ryamoli's renderings of important doctrinal terms. THE REPETITIONS Readers of Pali suttas, particularly in the original language, will immediately be struck by the frequency and length of the repeti-tive passages. The repetitions, if examined, will be found to be of different kinds and thus probably stem from different sources. We may consider three main types. First are the narrative repetitions within a single sutta as well as the repetition of statements in ordinary conversation. These doubtlessly originate from the method of oral transmission by which the suttas were preserved for the first four centuries of their existence, such repetition serving as a useful mnemonic device to ensure that details would not be lost. In this translation these repetitions have usually been bridged over with ellipsis points and occasionally the liberty was taken of contracting them. A second type of repetition stems from the use of stock for-mulas to describe fixed sets of doctrinal categories or aspects of the training. A commoIl-example of this is the formulas for the four jhanas and the three true knowledges. These formulas were almost certainly part of the Buddha' s repertory of instructions, employed by him in the countless discourses he gave during his forty-five years' ministry in order to preserve the unity and consistency of his teaching. Here the shorter stereotyped formulas have generally been allowed to stand except when they playa subordinate role to a larger theme, in which case only the main clauses have been retained; an exam-ple is the treatment of the jhana formula at MN 53.18. The longer formulas that appear very often have been abridged, with references usually given to the passages where they appear in full; examples are the treatment of the first two true knowledges at MN 27.23-24 and of the gradual training at MN 38.31-38. Introduction 53 A third type of repetition stems from the Buddha's application of an identical method of exposition to a series of doctrinal terms belonging to a fixed set. Examples are the formula for insight that is attached to each of the exercises in the Satipatthlina Sutta (MN 10.5), and the exposition on the three characteristics applied to each of the five aggregates (MN 22.26). These repetitions, con-trary to modernistic suppositions, were very likely integral to the Buddha's own pedagogical method and served to drive home the points he wanted to convey. We can well imagine that such repe-titions, delivered by a fully enlightened teacher to those earnestly striving for awakening, must have sunk down deep into the minds of those who heard them and in many cases triggered off a glimpse of the truth. In the translation this type of repetition has usually been handled by repeating the method of exposition only for the first and last terms in the set - as is often done in the Pali editions of the texts - except when the method of exposition is especially long (as at MN 118.37-39), in which case it is shown in full only for the first term and in much abbreviated form for the rest. Those who read the suttas as an exercise in contemplation, and not merely for information, may try mentally filling in the entire sequence and exploring its range of implications. DHAMMA In his later translations Yen. Na:ryamoli appears to have set him-self two goals: to render virtually every Pali word into English (arahant and bodhisatta are rare exceptions); and to do so in obedi-ence to a very rigorous standard of consistency. In effect the prin-ciple that guided his work was: one Pali word, one correspond-ing English word. This principle he also applied to his treatment of the multiplex word dhamma, of which he wrote elsewhere that \"the need for unity in the rendering is so great as to be almost desperate\" (Minor Readings and nIustrator, p. 331). He chose as his root rendering the word \"idea,\" which he attempted tQ. deploy for the Pali word in all its diverse occurrences. Even when dhamma is used in the suttas to signify the Buddha's teaching, he still remained faithful to his choice by translating it \"the True Idea.\" Needless to say, this experiment was not successful. Recog-nising this, Yen. Khantipalo, in his edition of the ninety suttas, opted instead to retain the Pali word in most of its occurrences."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"54 The Majjhima Niktlya This decision, however, seems to have been unnecessary when the relinquishing of the demand for strict consistency allows for smooth and reliable translation without loss of meaning. While the many different uses of the Pali word dhamma may originally have had some underlying connection of meaning, by the time of the Pali Canon such connection had already receded so far into the background as to be virtually irrelevant to the under-standing of the texts. The commentaries ascribe at least ten dif-ferent contextual meanings to the word as it occurs in the Canon and they do not try to read any philosophical significance into this variability of application. The goal of lucid translation there-fore seems to require that the word be rendered differently according to its context, which generally makes the intended meaning clear. In revising Yen. Na:t:lamoli's translation I have retained the Pali word Dhamma only when it refers to the Buddha's teaching, or in several cases to a rival teaching with which the Buddha's is contrasted (as at MN 11.13 and MN 104.2). In its other uses the context has been allowed to decide the rendering. Thus when dhamma occurs in the plural as a general ontological reference term it has been rendered \"things\" (as at MN 1.2 and MN 2.5). When it acquires a more technical nuance, in the sense either of the phenomena of existence or of mental constituents, it has been rendered \"states\" (as at MN 64.9 and MN 111.4). This term, however, must be divested of its overtone of staticity, dhammas being events within a dynamic process, and it must also not be taken to refer to some persisting entity that undergoes the states, entities themselves being nothing but connected series of dham-mas. The last two meanings of dhamma are not always separable in the texts and sometimes naturalness of English diction had to be used as the factor for deciding which should be selected. As the fourth foundation of mindfulness and as the sixth external sense base (ayatana), dhamma has been rendered \"mind-objects\" (even here \"ideas\" is too narrow). In still other con-texts it has been rendered as factors (MN 10.5), qualities (MN 15.3, MN 48.6) and teachings (MN 46.2, MN 47.3). When used as a suffix it acquires the idiomatic sense of \"to be subject to\" and so it has been translated, e.g., viparilJamadhamma as \"subject to change.\" i -Introduction 55 SANKHARA Although this word as used in the suttas has different specific references in different contexts, unlike dhamma it retains enough unity of meaning to permit, with rare exceptions, a uniform ren-dering. The problem, however, is to decide which of the many proposed renderings is the most adequate, or, if none are found fitting, to coin a new one that is. The root idea suggested by the word sankhara is \"making together.\" The Pali commentators explain that the word allows for both an active and a passive sense. Thus the sankharas are either factors (or forces) that function together in producing an effect, or they are the things that are produced by a combina-tion of co-operating factors. In his translation of the Visuddhimagga Yen. Nil:t:lamoli had rendered sankharas as \"for-mations,\" a rendering favoured by many other translators. In his later translation scheme he had experimented with rendering it as \"determinations\" and had attempted to incorporate that new choice into his manuscript of the Majjhima. In editing the manuscript Yen. Khantipalo chose to return to the translator's earlier and better known \"formations,\" and in this edition I have followed suit. Though this word has the disadvantage of accen-tuating the passive aspect of sankharas, it avoids the problems into which \"determinations\" runs and seems colourless enough to take on the meaning determined by the context. The word sankhara occurs in four major contexts in the Pali suttas: (1) As the second factor in the formula of dependent orig-ination it is used to mean volitional actions, suggesting their active role of generating results in the process of rebirth. (2) As the fourth of the five aggregates the sankharas comprise all the mental factors not included in the other three mental aggregates; this group is probably assigned the name sankhiirakkhandha after its chief member, volition (cetana), which is responsible for form-ing all the other aggregates. (3) Sankhara is also used in a very comprehensive sense to signify everything produced by condi-tions. In this sense it comprises all five aggregates (as at MN 35.4 and MN 115.12). Here the word bears the passive sense, being explained by the commentators as sankhatasankhara, \"formations consisting in the conditioned.\" This usage comes close in meaning"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"56 The Majjhima Nikaya to the ontological use of dhamma, except that the latter is wider in range since it includes the unconditioned element Nibbana and concepts (pafifiatti), both of which are excluded from sankhara. (4) In still another context the word sankhara is used in relation to kaya, vacT, and citta -body, speech, and mind -to mean the bodily formation, which is in-and-out breathing; the verbal formation, which is applied thought and sustained thought; and the mental formation, which is perception and f~eling. The first and third are things that are dependent respec-tively upon the body and the mind, the second the things that activate speech. This triad is discussed at MN 44.13-15. Sankhara is also emeloyed outside these major contexts, and in one such case Yen. Na1).amoli's sense of \"determination\" has been retained. This is where it occurs in the compound padhanasankhara, which has been rendered \"determined striv-ing\" (as at MN 16.26). The rare and involved idiom, sankhtlram padahati, has similarly been rendered \"he strives with determi-nation\" (MN 101.23). In another case (MN 120), following the commentarial gloss, sankhara is rendered \"aspiration.\" NAMARUPA Yen. Na1).amoli had translated this compound literally as \"name-and-form.\" In this edition the compound has been changed back to the rendering used in his translation of the Vi~uddhimagga, \"mentality-materiality,\" though with regret that thIs cumbersome Latinate ~xpression lacks the concision and punch of \"name-and-form.\" The word nama originally meant \"name,\" but in the Pali suttas it is used in this compound as a collective term for the mental factors associated with conscious-ness, as will be seen in the definition at MN 9.54. The commen-taries explain nama here as deriving from the word namati, to bend, and as being applied to the mental factors because they \"bend\" towards the object in the act of cognizing it. Rupa is used in two major contexts in the suttas: as the first of the five aggre-gates and as the specific object of eye-consciousness. The former is a broader category that includes the latter as one among many other species of rupa. Yen. Na1).amoli, aiming at consistency in his manuscript translation, had used \"form\" for rupa as visible object (in preference to the \"visible-datum\" used in his earlier , '> Introduction 57 translation scheme). But when rupa is used to signify the first of the five aggregates, it has been changed to \"material form.\" This rendering should indicate more precisely the meaning of rupa in that context while preserving the connection with rilpa as visible object. Occasionally in the texts the word seems to straddle both meaning without allowing an exclusive delimitation, as in the context of certain meditative attainments such as the first two liberations (MN 77.22). BRAHMA The word brahma provided Yen. Na1).amoli with another chal-lenge to his endeavour to achieve complete consistency. The word itself, going back to the Vedic period, originally meant holy power, the sacred power that sustains the cosmos and that was contacted through the prayers and rituals of the Vedas. Though the word retained its significance of \"holy\" or \"sacred,\" by the Buddha's time it had undergone two distinct lines of development. One culminated in the conception of Brahman (neuter) as an impersonal absolute reality hidden behind and manifesting through the changing phenomena of the world. This conception is the keynote of the Upanishads, but the word brahma never appears in this sense in the Pali Canon. The other line of development culminated in the conception of Brahma (masculine singular) as an eternal personal God who creates and regulates the world. This conception was held by the brahmins as depicted in the Pali suttas. The Buddhists themselves asserted that Brahma was not a single creator God but a collective name for several classes of high deities whose chiefs, forgetting that they are still transient beings in the grip of kamma, were prone to imagine themselves to be the omnipotent everlasting creator (see MN 49). Yen. Na1).amoli attempted to fulfil his guideline of consistency by rendering the word brahma in its various occurrences by \"divine\" or its cognates. Thus Brahma the deity was rendered \"the Divinity,\" brahma1Ja (= bralunin) was rendered \"divine\" (as a noun meaning a priestly theologian), and the expression brahma-cariya, in which brahma functions as an adjective, was rendered \"the Life Divine.\" The result of this experiment was again the sacrifice of clarity for the sake of consistency, even at the risk of )"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"58 The Majjhima Nikaya generating misunderstanding, and therefore in the revisionary process I decided to treat these expressions in line with more conventional practices. Thus Brahma and brahmin have been left untranslated (the latter word is probably already more familiar to modern readers than the archaic noun\" divine\"). The word brahma, as it appears in compounds, has usually been ren-dered \"holy\" - e.g., brahmacariya as \"the holy life\" except when it is used to signify total sexual abstinence, in which case it has been rendered in accordance with its intended meaning as \"celibacy.\" The word \"divine\" has, however, been retained in the expression brahmavihlira, rendered\" divine abode\" (MN 83.6) with reference to the \"immeasurable\" meditations on loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, which are the dwellings of the divinity Brahma (MN 55.7) and the path to rebirth in the Brahma-world (MN 99.22). A NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION The pronunciation of Pali words and names is quite easy provid-ing the following simple rules are heeded. Among the vowels: a u a I u e and 0 as in 'but,\" \"pin,\" \"duke\"; as in \"father,\" \"keen,\" \"pool\"; as in \"way\" and \"home.\" Among the consonants, g is pronounced as in \"girl,\" c as in \"h h\"-.\" \"Th b 1 d 1 c urc , n as m canyon. e cere ra s -t, .' /}, . -are spoken with the tongue on the roof Of the mouth; the dentals -t, d, n, 1-with the tongue on the upper teeth. ni is a nasal as in \"sing.\" The aspirates -kh, gh, ch, jh, th, qh, th, dh, ph, and bh -are single con-sonants pronounced with a slight outward puff of breath, e.g., th as in \"Thomas\" (not as in \"that\"), ph as in \"top hat\" (not as in \"phone\"). Double consonants are always enunciated separately, e.g., dd as in \"mad dog,\" gg as in \"big gun.\" An 0 and an e always carry a stress, otherwise the stress falls on a long vowel -ii, I, or ii -or on a double consonant, or on m. , ~ ~ .~. s: Introduction 59 MAJOR CHANGES IN TERMINOLOGY This list shows the most important of the changes in Yen.

The Buddha rejects the view that the mere attainment of the meditative absorptions is effacement and explains how effacement is properly prac-tised in his teaching. Sammaditthi Sutta: Right View. A long and important dis-course by the venerable Sariputta, with separate sections on the wholesome and the unwholesome, nutriment, the Four Noble Truths, the twelve factors of dependent origi-nation, and the taints. Satipatthtina Sutta: The Foundations of Mindfulness. This is one of the fullest and most important suttas by the Buddha dealing with meditation, with particular emphasis on the development of insight. The Buddha begins by declaring the four foundations of mindfulness to be the direct path for the realisation of Nibbana, then gives detailed instruc-tions on the four foundations: the contemplation of the body, feelings, mind, and mind-objects. Cu!aslhanada Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar.

The Buddha expounds the ten powers of a Tathagata, his four kinds of intrepidity, and other superior qualities, which entitle him to \"roar his lion's roar in the assemblies.\" Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering. The Buddha explains the full under-standing of sensual pleasures, material form, and feelings; there is a long section on the dangers in sensual pleasures. Culadukkhakkhandha Sutta: The Shorter Discou~se on the Mass of Suffering. A variation on the preceding, ending in a discussion with Jain ascetics on the nature of pleasure and pain. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 A Summary of the 152 Suttas 63 Anumana Sutta: Inference.

Cetokhila Sutta: The Wilderness in the Heart. The Buddha explains to the bhikkhus the five \"wildernesses in the heart\" and the five \"shackles in the heart.\" Vanapattha Sutta: Jungle Thickets. A discourse on the con-ditions under which a meditative monk should remain liv-ing in a jungle thicket and the conditions under which he should go elsewhere. Madhupir:ujika Sutta: The Honey Ball.

Dvedhavitakka Sutta: Two Kinds of Thought. With reference to his own struggle for enlightenment, the Buddha explains the way to overcome unwholesome thoughts and replace them by wholesome thoughts. Vitakkasa1Jthana Sutta: The Removal of Distracting Thoughts. The Buddha teaches five methods for dealing with the unwholesome thoughts that may arise in the course of meditation. Kakacupama Sutta: The Simile of the Saw. A discourse on the need to maintain patience when addressed with dis-agreeable words. Alagaddupama Sutta: The Simile of the Snake. A bhikkhu named Arittha gives rise to a pernicious view that conduct prohibited by the Buddha is not really an obstruction. The Buddha reprimands him and, with a series of memorable similes, stresses the dangers in misapplying and misrepre-senting the Dhamma. The sutta culminates in one of the most impressive disquisitions on non-self found in the Canon. Vammika Sutta: The Ant-hill.

The venerable Ptu:U).a Mantar:tiputta explains to Sariputta that the goal of the holy life, final Nibbana, is to be reached by way of the seven stages of purification. 25 Nivapa Sutta: The Bait. The Buddha uses the analogy of deer-trappers to make known to the bhikkhus the obsta-cles that confront them in their effort to escape from Mara's control. 26 Ariyapariyesana Sutta: The Noble Search. The Buddha gives the bhikkhus a long account of his own quest for enlight-enment from the time of his life in the palace up to his transmission of the Dhamma to his first five disciples. 27 Culahatthipadopama Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprint. Using the analogy of a woodsman tracking down a big bull elephant, the Buddha explains how a disciple arrives at complete certainty of the truth of his teaching. The sutta presents a full account of the step-by-step training of the Buddhist monk. 28 Mahahatthipadopama Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprint. The venerable Sariputta begins with a statement of the Four Noble Truths, which he then expounds by way of the contemplation of the four ele-ments and the dependent origination of the five aggregates. 29 Mahasaropama Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood. 30 Culasaropama Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood. These two discourses emphasise that the proper goal of the holy life is the unshakeable deliverance of the mind, to which all other benefits are subsidiary. 31 Culagosinga Sutta: The Shorter Discourse in Gosinga. The Buddha meets three bhikkhus who are living in concord, \"blending like milk and water,\" and inquires how they . succeed in living together so harmoniously. 32 Mahagosinga Sutta: The Greater Discourse in Gosinga. On a beautiful moonlit night a number of senior disciples meet together in a sala-tree wood and discuss what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate the wood. After each has answered according to his personal ideal, they go to the Buddha, who provides his own answer. • A Summary of the 152 Suttas 65 33 Mahagopalaka Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Cowherd. The Buddha teaches eleven qualities that pre-vent a bhikkhu's growth in the Dhamma and eleven quali-ties that contribute to his growth. 34 Culagopalaka Sutta: The Shbrter Discourse on the Cowherd. The Buddha explains the types of bhikkhus who \"breast Mara's stream\" and get safely across to the further shore. 35 Culasaccaka Sutta: The Shorter Discourse to Saccaka. The debater Saccaka boasts that in debate he can shake the Buddha up and down and thump him about, but when he finally meets the Buddha their discussion takes some unexpected turns. 36 Mahiisaccaka Sutta: The Greater Discourse to Saccaka. The Buddha meets again with Saccaka and in the course of a discussion on \"development of body\" and \"development of mind\" he relates a detailed narrative on his own spiri-tual quest. 37 CulatalJhasankhaya Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. The venerable Maha Moggallana overhears the Buddha give a brief explanation to Sakka, ruler of gods, as to how a bhikkhu is liberated through the destruction of craving. Wishing to know if Sakka under-stood the meaning, he makes a trip to the heaven of the Thirty-three to find out. 38 Mahiita1Jhasankhaya Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. A bhikkhu named Sati promul-gates the pernicious view that the same consciousness transmigrates from life to life. The Buddha reprimands him with a lengthy discourse on dependent origination, showing how all phenomena of existence arise and cease through conditions. 39 Mahii-Assapura Sutta: The Greater Discourse at Assapura . The Buddha elucidates \"the things that make one a recluse\" with a discourse covering many aspects of the bhikkhu's training. 40 Cula-Assapura Sutta: The Shorter Discourse at Assapura. The Buddha explains \"the way proper tythe recluse\" to be not the mere outward practice of a sterities but the inward purification from defilements."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"66 The MaJjhima Niktlya 41 Saleyyaka Sutta: The Brahmins of Sala. 42 Veranjaka Sutta: The Brahmins of Veranja.

These two discourses take the form of discussions on vari-ous subtle points of Dhamma, the former between the ven-erable Maha Kotthita and the venerable Sariputta, the latter between the bhikkhuru Dhammadinna and the lay follower Visakha. 45 Cil!adhammasamadana Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things. 46 Mahadhammasaml'ldllna Sutta: The Greater Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things. The Buddha explains, differently in each of the two suttas, four ways of undertaking things, distinguished according to whether they are painful or pleasant now and whether they ripen in pain or pleasure in the future. 47 VTmamsaka Sutta: The Inquirer. The Buddha invites the bhikkhus to make a thorough investigation of himself in order to find out whether or not he can be accepted as fully enlightened. • 48 Kosambiya Sutta: The Kosambians. During the period when the bhikkhus at Kosambi are divided by a dispute, the Buddha teaches them the six qualities that create love and respect and conduce to unity.

On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiD<;lika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" -\"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this: 2. \"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the restraint of all the taints.32 [7] Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.\" - \"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: (SUMMARY) 3. \"Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and see. Who knows and sees what? Wise attention and unwise atten-tion.33 When one attends unwisely, una risen taints arise and arisen taints increase. When one attends wisely, unarisen taints do not arise and arisen taints are abandoned. 4. \"Bhikkhus, there are taints that should be abandoned by seeing. There are taints that should be abandoned by restrain-ing. There are taints that should be abandoned by using. There are taints that should be abandoned by enduring. There are taints that should be abandoned by avoiding. There are taints that should be abandoned by removing. There are taints that should be abandoned by developing.34 (TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY SEEING) 5. \"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by seeing?35 Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their 91 ~"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"92 Sabbllsava Sutta: Sutta 2 i 8 Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, does not understand what things are fit for attention and what things are unfit for atten-tion. Since that is so, he attends to those things unfit for atten-tion and he does not attend to those things fit for attention.36 6. \"What are the things unfit for attention that he attends to? They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint of sensual desire arises in him and the arisen taint of sensual desire increases, the una risen taint of being arises in him and the arisen taint of being increases, the unarisen taint of igno-rance arises in him and the arisen taint of ignorance increases. These are the things unfit for attention that he attends to.37 And what are the things fit for attention that he does not attend to? They are things such that when he attends to them, the una risen taint of sensual desire does not arise in him and the arisen taint of sensual desire is abandoned, the unarisen taint of being does not arise in him and the arisen taint of being is abandoned,the unarisen taint of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen taint ~f ignorance is abandoned. These are the things fit for atte~tlOn that ~e does not attend to. [8] By attending to things ~nflt for attentIon and by not attending to things fit for atten-tIon, both unarisen taints arise in him and arisen taints increase. 7 . . \"This is how he attends unwisely: 'Was I in the past? Was I not ~ the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Havmg been what, what did I become in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in th'e future? Having been what, what shall I become in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the present thus: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where will it gO?'38 8. \"When he attends unwisely in this way, one of six views arises in him.39 The view 'self exists for me' arises in him as true and established; or the view 'no self exists for me' arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I perceive self with self arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I perceive not-self with self' arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I perceive self with not-self' arises in him as true and established; or else he has some such view as this: 'It is this self of mine that speaks and feels and experiences here and there the result of good and bad actions; but this self of mine is permanent, All the Taints 93 i9 --------------------------------------everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and it wi~l endure as long as eterruty.'40 This speculative vie~, bhikkhus, IS call~d the thicket of views, the wilderness of VIews, the contortIon of viewS, the vacillation of views, the fetter of views. Fettered by the fetter of views, the untaught ordinary person is not freed from birth, ageing, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; he is not freed from suffering, I say. 9. \"Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dharnma, who has regard for true men and is skilled and. disciplined. in their Dhamma, understands what things are fIt for attentIon and what things are unfit for attention.

They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint of sensual desire does not arise in him ... (as §6) ... and the arisen taint of ignorance is abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that he attends to. By not attending to things unfit for attention and by attending to things fit for attention, unarisen taints do not arise in him and arisen taints are abandoned. 11. \"He attends wisely: 'This is suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the origin of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the way lead-ing to the cessation of suffering.'41 When he attends wisely in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: personality view, doubt and adherence to rules and observances. These are called the taints that should be abandoned by seeing.42 (TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY RESTRAll\"JINC) 12. \"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by restrain-ing?43 Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, abides with the eye fac-ulty restrained.

The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. L 3 Dhammadayada Sutta Heirs in Dhamma 1. THUS HAvE I HEARD.

What can the Bahuka River do?\" i 39 The Simile of the Cloth 121 \"Master Gotama, the Bahuka River is held by many to give liberation, it is held by many to give merit, and many wash away their evil actions in the Bahuka River.\" 20.

[40] And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Bharadvaja, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.

An assembly of nobles, an assembly of brahmins, an assembly of householders, an assembly of recluses, an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings, an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three, an assembly of Mara's retinue, an assembly of Brahmas. Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity, the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assemblies. 30. \"I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles ... many hundred assemblies of brahmins ... many hun-dred assemblies of householders ... many hundred assemblies of recluses ... many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings ... many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three ... many hundred assemblies of Mara's retinue ... many hundred a~semblies of Brahmas.

(THE BODHISATIA'S AUSTERITIES) 44. \"Sariputta, I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factors. I have practised asceticism - the extreme of asceticism; I have practised coarseness - the extreme of coarseness; I have practised scrupulousness -the extreme of scrupulousness; I have practised seclusion - the extreme of seclusion.193 45. \"Such was my asceticism, Sariputta, that I went naked, rejecting conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; I received nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying with a man, from where food was advertised to be distributed, from where a dog was waiting, from where flies were buzzing; I accepted no fish or meat, I drank no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. I kept to one house, to one morsel; I kept to two [78] hous-es, to two morsels; .. .1 kept to seven houses, to seven morsels. I lived on one saucerful a day, on two saucerfuls a day ... on seven saucerfuls a day; I took food once a day, once every two days . . . once every seven days, and so on up to once every fort-night; I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals. I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hide-parings or moss or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. I lived on forest roots and fruits; I fed on fallen fruits. I clothed myself in hemp, in hemp-mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in kusa-grass fabric, in bark fabric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair wool, in animal wool, in owls' Wings.

I was one who stood"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"174 Mahasflumada Sutta: Sutta 12 i 79 continuously, rejecting seats. 1 was one who squatted continu-ously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. 1 was one who used a mattress of spikes; 1 made a mattress of spikes my bed. 1 dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily includ~ng the eveni.ng. Thus in such a variety of ways 1 dwelt pursurng the practIce of tormenting and mortifying the body. Such was my asceticism. ~6. \"Such was my coarseness, Sariputta, that just as the bole of a tinduka tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body and flaked off. It never occurred to me: 'Oh, let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand, or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand' - it never occurred to me thus. Such was my coarseness. ~7. \"Su~h was ~y scrupulousness, Sariputta, that 1 was always mmdful m steppmg forwards and stepping backwards. 1 was full of pity even for [the beings in] a drop of water thus: 'Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground.'

And when 1 saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a ~oodsman, 1 would flee from grove to grove, from thicket to thIcket, from hollow to hollow, from hillock to hillock. Why was that? So that they should not see me or 1 see them. Just as a forest-bred deer, on seein.g human beings, flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock, so too, when 1 saw a cowherd or a'shep-herd .. .such was my seclusion. 49. \"I would go on all fours to the cow-pens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them, and 1 would feed on the dung of the young suckling calves. As long as my own ex~rement and urine lasted, 1 fed on my own excrement and urme. Such was my great distortion in feeding. 50. \"I would plunge into some awe-inspiring grove and dwell there - a grove so awe-inspiring that normally it would make a man's hair stand up if he were not free from lust. When those cold wintry nights came during the 'eight-days interval of frost,' 1 would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove.194 In the last month of the hot season 1 would dwell by day in the The Greater Discourse on the Lion's Roar 175 ---------------------------------------------------open and by night in the grove. And there came to me sponta-neously this stanza never heard before: 'Chilled by night and scorched by day, Alone in awe-inspiring groves, Naked, no fire to sit beside, The sage yet pursues his quest.' 51. \"I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillow. And cowherd boys came up and spat on me, urinated on me, threw dirt at me, and poked sticks into my ears. Yet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind [of hate] against them. Such was my abiding in equanimity. [80] 52. \"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahrnins whose doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through £000..'195 They say: 'Let us live on kola-fruits,' and they eat kola-fruits, they eat kola-fruit powder, they drink kola-fruit water, and they make many kinds of kola-fruit concoctions. Now 1 recall having eaten a single kola-fruit a day. Sariputta, you may think that the kola-fruit was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so: the kola-fruit was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding on a single kola-fruit a day, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel's hoof. Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads. Because of eating so lit-tle my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roof-less bam. Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like a gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if 1 touched my belly skin 1 encountered my backbone, and if 1 touched my backbone 1 encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if 1 tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed. 53-55. \"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"176 Mahasfhanada Sutta: Sutta 12 i 82 through food.'

Sariputta, you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so: the rice grain was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding on a single rice grain a day, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little ... the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed. 56. \" Yet, Sariputta, by such conduct, by such practice, by such performance of austerities, I did not attain any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why was that? Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the com-plete destruction of suffering. 57. \"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through the round of rebirths.' But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already [82] passed through in this long journey, except for the gods of the Pure Abodes; and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes, I would never have returned to this world.196 58. \"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through [some par-ticular kind of] rebirth.'

But 1 i83 The Greater Discourse on the Lion's Roar 177 it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey, when I was either a head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin. 62. \"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'As long as this good man is still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wis-dom. But when this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.' But it should not be regarded so. I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years' lifespan, perfect in mind-fulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of wisdom.197 Just as a skilled archer, trained, practised, and tested, could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness, reten-tiveness, [83] memory, and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a sub-sidiary question or paused except to eat, drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate, and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness. Still the Tathagata's exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors of the Dhamma, and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end, but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years' lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years. Sariputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata's wisdom. 63. \"Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: 'A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,' it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said.\" 64. Now on that occasion the venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him.198 Then he said to the Blessed One: \"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous!

The venerable Nagasamala was satIsfIed and delIghted in the Blessed One's words. 13 Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, Anathapll:t<;lika's Park. 2. Then, when it was morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, and taking their bowls and outer robes, [84] went into SavatthI for alms. Then they thought: \"It is still too early to wander for alms in SavatthI. Suppose we went to the park of the wanderers of other sects.\" So they went to the park of the wanderers of other sects and exchanged greetings with the wanderers. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side. The wanderers said to them: 3. \"Friends, the recluse Gotama describes the full understand-ing of sensual pleasures, and we do so too; the recluse Gotama describes the full understanding of material form, and we do so too; the recluse Gotama describes the full understanding of feel-ings, and we do so too. What then is the distinction here, friends, what is the variance, what is the difference between the recluse Gotama's teaching of the Dhamma and ours, between his instructions and ours7\"200 4. Then those bhikkhus neither approved nor disapproved of the wanderers' words. Without doing either they rose from their seats and went away, thinking: \"We shall come to understand the meaning of these words in the Blessed One's presence.\" 5. When they had wandered for alms in SavatthI and had returned from their almsround, after the meal they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him what had taken place. [The Blessed One said:] [85] 6. \"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be questioned thus: 'But, friends, what is the gratification, what 179"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"180 Mahadukkhalckhandha Sutta: Sutta 13 i 86 is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of sensual plea-sures? What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of material form? What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of feel-ings?' Being questioned thus, wanderers of other sects will fail to account for the matter, and what is more, they will get into difficulties. Why is that? Because it is not their province. Bhikkhus, I see no one in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its people, who could satisfy the mind with a reply to these questions, except for the Tathagata or his disci-ple or one who has learned it from them. (SENSUAL PLEASURES) 7. (i) \"And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of sen-sual pleasures? Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ... Odours cognizable by the nose ... Flavours cognizable by the tongue ... TangIbles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sen-sual desire, and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of seI\\Sual pleasure are the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures. 8. (ii) \"And what, bhikkhus, is the danger in the case of sensual pleasures? Here, bhikkhus, on account of the craft by which a clansman makes a living -whether checking or accounting or calculating or farming or trading or husbandry or archery or the royal service, or whatever craft it may be -he has to face cold, he has to face heat, he is injured by contact with gadflies, mosqui-toes, wind, sun, and creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst. Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible here and now, having sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its source, sensual pleasures as its basis, [86] the cause being simply sensual pleasures. 9. \"If no property comes to the clansman while he works and i 87 The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering 181 strives and makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: 'My work is in vain, my effort is fruitless!'

And as he guards and protects his property, kings or thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away, or hateful heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: 'What I had I have no longer!' Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures. 11. \"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual plea-sures as the source, sensual pleasures as the basis, the cause being simply sensual pleasures, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, householders with house-holders; mother quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child, child with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes they attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures. 12. \"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take swords and shields and buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge into battle massed in double array with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing; and there they are wounded by arrows and spears, and their heads are cut off by swords, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering.

On one occasion the Ble~sed On; was liv-ing in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha sPark. 2. Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding, and entering the Great Wood, sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the day's abiding. 3. Dandapani the Sakyan, while walking and wandering for exercise~ ~lso went to the Great Wood, and when he had entered the Great Wood, he went to the bilva sapling where the Blessed One was and exchanged greetings with him. When ~his cou~te­ous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one sIde leanmg on his stick and asked the Blessed One: \"What does the recluse h I· 7\"226 assert, what does e proc mm. . 4. \"Friend, I assert and proclaim such [a tea~hlI~.g] that o~e does not quarrel with anyone in the world WIth ItS gods, ItS Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people; such [a teac~ngl that per-ceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abIdes detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of being.\"227 . 5. When this was said, Dal)qaparu the Sakyan shook his head, [109] wagged his tongue, and raised his eyebrows until his f~re­head was puckered in three lines.228 Then he departed, learung on his stick. 6. Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from med-itation and went to Nigtodha's Park, where he sat down on a seat made ready for him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place. Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: 201"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"202 Madhupitp#ka Sutta: Sutta 18 i 111 7. \"But, venerable sir, what is [the teaching] that the Blessed One asserts whereby one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this genera-tion with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people? And, venerable sir, how is it that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of being?\" 8. \"Bhikkhus, as to the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust, of the underlying tendency to aversion, [110] of the underlying tendency to views, of the underlying tendency to doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit, of the underlying tendency to desire for being, of the underlying tendency to ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malice, and false speech; here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.\"229 9. That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling. 10. Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered: \"Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?\" \\hen they considered: \"The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.230 He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this.\" 11. Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down to one side and told him what had taken place, [111] adding: \"Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to us.\" 12. [The venerable Maha Kaccana replied:] \"Friends, it is as though a man needjng heartwood, seeking heartwood, wander-ing in search of heartwood, thought that heartwood should be sought for among the branches and leaves of a great tree stand-ing possessed of heartwood, after he had passed over the root The Honeyball 203 illl2~ ________ ----------------------~------d the trunk.

On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing at Savatthi: in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiDc;iika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" -\"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this: 2. \"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, it occurred to me: 'Suppose that I divide my thoughts into two classes.'235 Then I set on one side thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of cruelty, and I set on the other side thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill will, and thoughts of non-cruelty.236 3. \"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, [115] a thought of sensual desire arose in me. I understood thus: 'This thought of sensual desire has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to others' affliction, and to the affliction of both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana.' When I considered: 'This leads to my own affliction,' it subsided in me; when I considered: 'This leads to others' affliction,' it subsided in me; when I considered: 'This leads to the affliction of both,' it subsided in me; when I considered: 'This obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana,' it subsided in me. Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I abandoned it, removed it, did away with it. 4-5. \"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of ill will arose in me ... a thought of cruelty arose in me.

If he frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill will ... upon thoughts of cruelty, he has abandoned the thought of non-cruelty to cultivate the thought of cruelty, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of cruelty. 7. \"Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly tapping and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check and curb them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged, imprisoned, fined, or blamed [if he let them stray into the crops]. So too I saw in unwholesome states dan-ger, degradation, and defilement, and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the aspect of cleansing. [116] 8. 1/ As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of renunciation arose in me. I understood thus: 'This thought of renunciation has arisen in me. This does not lead to my own affliction, or to others' affliction, or to the affliction of both; it aids wisdom, does not cause difficulties, and leads to Nibbana. If I think and ponder upon this thought even for a night, even for a day, even for a night and day, I see nothing to fear from it. But with excessive thinking and pondering I might tire my body, and when the body is tired, the mind becomes disturbed, and when the mind is disturbed, it is far from concentration.' So I steadied my mind internally, quieted it, brought it to single-ness, and concentrated it. Why is that? So that my mind should not be disturbed.237 9-10. \"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of non-ill will arose in me ... a thought of non-cruelty arose in me.

So I steadied my mind ~ternal1y, quieted it, brought it to singleness, and concentrated it. Why is that?

[118] This is the meaning: 'The great low-lying marsh' IS a term for sensual pleasures. 'The large herd of deer' is a term for beings. 'The man desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage' is a term for Mara the Evil One. 'The false path' is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration. 'The decoy' is a term for delight and lust. 'The dummy' is a term for ignorance. 'The man desiring their good, welfare, and protection' is a term for the Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened. 'The safe and good path that led to their happiness' is a term for the Noble Eightfold Path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindful-ness, and right concentration. \"50, bhikkhus, the safe and good path that leads to happiness has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed. 27. \"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, bhikkhus. There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not delay or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you.\" That is what the Blessed ~ne said.

Now on that occasion the venerable Moliya Phagguna was associating overmuch with bhikkhunIs.245 He was associating so much with bhlkkhunls that if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of those bhikkhunIs in his presence, he would become angry and displeased and would rebuke him; and if any bhikkhu spoke dispraise of the venerable Moliya Phagguna in those bhikkhunIs' presence, they would become angry and displeased and would rebuke him. 50 much was the venerable Moliya Phagguna asso-ciating with bhikkhunIs. 3. Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what was taking place. 4.

Then later on a bad report about Mistress Vedehika spread thus: 'Mistress Vedehika is rough, Mistress Vedehika is violent, Mistress Vedehika is merciless.' 10. \"50 too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu is extremely kind, extremely gentle, extremely peaceful, so long as disagreeable courses of speech do not touch him. But it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch him that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind, gentle, and peaceful. I do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake of getting robes, almsfood, a resting place, and medicinal requisites. Why is that? Because that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites. But when a bhikkhu is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he hon-ours, respects, and reveres the Dhamma, him I call easy to admonish. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We shall be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honour, respect, and revere the Dhamma.'

A deer-trapper lays down bait for a deer herd intending thus: 'The deer herd will eat food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait that I have laid down; by so doing they will become intoxicated; when they are intoxicated, they will fall into negligence; when they are negligent, I can do with them as I like on account of this bait.' 3. \"Now the deer of the first herd ate food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down; by so doing they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated, they fell into negligence: when they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he liked on account of that bait.

But in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water were used up, their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation; with that they lost their strength and energy; when they had lost their strength and energy, they returned to that same bait that the deer-trapper had laid down. 246 The Bait 247 i 154 ---~~-------------------------------------------They ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it.

Why, being myself subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the un~orn supreme security from bondage, Nibbana. Suppose that, bemg myself subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, I seek the unageing, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana.' 14. \"Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness. 15. \"Having gone forth, bhikkhus, in search of what is whole-~ome, seekin~ the supreme state of sublime peace, I went to Alara Kalamaymd said to him: 'Friend Kalama, I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline.'

And it is hard to see this truth, namely, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruc-tion of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbana. [168] If I were to teach the Dhamma, others would not understand me, and that would be wearying and. troublesome for me.' Thereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzas never heard before: 'Enough with teaching the Dhamma That even I found hard to reach; For it will never be perceived By those who live in lust and hate. Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma Which goes against the worldly stream, Subtle, deep, and difficult to see.' Considering thus, my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.307 The Noble Search 261 i 169 ---~-----------------------------------------------20. \"Then, bhikkhus, the Brahma Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in my mind and he considered: 'The world will be lost, the world will perish, since the mind of the Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.' Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahma Sahampati vanished in the Brahma-world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me, said: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma.' The Brahma Sahampati spoke thus, and then he said further: 'In Magadha there have appeared till now Impure teachings devised by those still stained. Open the doors to the Deathless!

Then I thought: 'Where are the bhikkhus of the group of five now liv-ing?'

Then, bhikkhus, wandering by stages, I eventually came to ~enares, to the Deer Park at Isipatana, and I approached the bhikkhus of the group of five.

Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Perhaps some time or other [1781 we might meet Master Gotama and have some conversation with him.\" 9. Then the brahmin Jal)ussot)i went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and ami-able talk was finished, he sat down at one side and related to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the wanderer Pilotika. Thereupon the Blessed One told him: (I At this point, brahmin, the simile of the elephant's footprint has not yet been completed in detail. As to how it is completed in detail, listen and attend carefully to what I shall say.\" -\"Yes, sir,\" the brahmin Jfu:Lussot)i replied.

It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness.'

THUS HAVE I HEARO.J27 On one occasion the Blessed One was living at 5avatthl in Jeta's Grove, Anathapi..J).9ika's Park. There the venerable 5ariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\" -\"Friend,\" they replied. The venerable 5ariputta said this: 2. \"Friends, just as the footprint of any living being that walks can be placed within an elephant's footprint, and so the elephant's footprint is declared the chief of them because of its great size; so too, all wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths.328 In what four? In the noble truth of suffer-ing, [185] in the noble truth of the origin of suffering, in the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and in the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering. 3. \"And what is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, ageing is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in short, the {ive aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. 4. \"And what are the five aggregates affected by clinging? They are: the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by cling-ing, and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. 5. \"And what is the material form aggregate affected by cling-ing? It is the four great elements and the material form derived from the four great elements. And what are the four great ele-ments? They are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element. 278 The Simile of the Elephant's Footprint (Greater) 279 (THE EARTH ELEMENT) 6. \"What, friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be either internal or external. What is the inte~al e~rth el~~~nt? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, IS sohd, solIdIfIed, and clung-to; that is, head-hairs, body-h~irs, nails, teeth, ~kin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kIdneys, heart, lIver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, con-tents of the stomach, feces, or whatever else internally, belong-ing to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.329 Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth element.33o And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dis-passionate toward the earth element. . . 7. \"Now there comes a time when the water element IS dIS-turbed and then the external earth element vanishes.331 When even this external earth element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to destruction, disappearance, and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I' or 'mine' or 'I am.'332 8. \"50 then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: 'This painful feeling born of ear-contact has arisen in me. That is dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? [186] Dependent on contact.'333 Then he sees that contact is imperma-nent, that feeling is impermanent, that perception is imperma-nent, that formations are impermanent, and that consciousness is impermanent. And his mind, having made an element its objective support, enters into [that new objective support] and acquires confidence, steadiness, and decision.334 9. \"Now, if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, by contact with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, he understands thus: 'This body is of such a nature that contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives assail it.335 But this has been said by the Blessed One in his \"advice on the simile of the saw\": \"Bhikkhus, even if bandits"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"280 Mahahatthipadopama Sutta: Sutta 28 i 187 were to sever you savagely limb by limb with a two-handled saw, he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my teaching.\"336 So tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness established, my body shall be tranquil and untroubled, my mind concentrated and unified. And now let contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives assail this body; for this is just how the Buddha's teach-ing is practised.' 10. \"When that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, then he arouses a sense of urgency thus: 'It is a loss for me, it is no gain for me, it is bad for me, it is no good for me, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me.'337 Just as when a daughter-in-law sees her father-in-law, she arouses a sense of urgency [to please him], so too, when that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equa-nimity supported by the wholesome does not become estab-lished in him, then he arouses a sense of urgency. But if, when he recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equa-nimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him, [187] then he is satisfied with it. At that point, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu. (THE WATER ELEMENT) 11. \"What, friends, is the water element? The water element may be either internal or external.

Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to; that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to: this is called the internal water element. Now both the inter-nal water element and the external water element are simply water element.

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Vajjian country at Ukkacela on the banks of the river Ganges. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" - '''Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this: 2. \"Bhikkhus, there was once a foolish Magadhan cowherd who, in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, with-out examining the near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford. Then the cattle bunched together in mid-stream in the river Ganges, and they met with calamity and disaster. Why was that? Because that foolish Magadhan cowherd, in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, without examining the near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford. 3. \"So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Mara's realm and what is outside Mara's realm, unskilled in the realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death - it will lead to the harm and suffering for a long time of those who think they should listen to them and place faith in them. 4. \"Bhikkhus, there was once a wise Magadhan cowherd who, in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after exam-ining the near shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had a ford.

He made the calves and the feeble cattle enter next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore.

S. So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Mara's realm and what is outside Mara's realm, skilled in the realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death -it will lead to the welfare :md happiness for a long time of those who think they should hsten to them and place faith in them. 6. \"Bhikkhus, just as the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd, breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid do~n the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of bemg, and are completely liberated through final knowledge -by breastin& Mara's stream they have gotten safely across to the further shore. 7. \"Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, will reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world -by breasting Mara's stream they will get safely across to the further shore. 8. \"Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters'and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, retur~g o~ce, to this world to make an end of suffering -by breastmg Mara s stream they too will get safely across to the fur-i227 ~ The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd 321 ther shore. 9 \"Just as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the stream f ~he Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, o bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters, are those '. . .

When the SublIme One had said that, the Teacher said further: \"Both this world and the world beyond Are well described by the one who knows, And what is still in Mara's reach And what is out of reach of Death. Knowing directly all the world, The Enlightened One who understands Opened the door to the deathless state By which Nibbana may be safely reached; For Mara's stream is breasted now, Its current blocked, its reeds removed; Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily And set your hearts where safety lies.\""},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"35 Culasaccaka Sutta The Shorter Discourse to Saccaka 1.

Or suppose a man were afflicted, suffering and gravely ill, and his food would not agree with him and his body had no strength, but later he would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with him and his body would regain strength; then on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were imprisoned in a prisonhouse, but later he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss to his property; then on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were a slave, not self-dependent but dependent on others, unable to go where he wants, but later on he would be released from slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a freed man able to go where he wants; then on considering this, [276] he would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man with wealth and property were to enter a'road across a desert, but later on he would cross over the desert, safe and secure, with no loss to his property; then on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. So too, bhikkhus, when these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself, a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt, a disease, a prisonhouse, slavery, and a road across a desert. But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself, he sees that as freedom from debt, healthiness, release from prison, freedom from slavery, and a land of safety.418 (THE FOUR JHANAS) 15. \"Having abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclu-sion.

But no peacoc~ ~wallowed that seed, no wild animal ate it, no forest fire burned It, no. woodsmen carried it off, no white ants devoured it, and it was m fact fertile. Then, being moistened by rain from a rain-bearing cloud, the seed in due course sprouted and the maluva creeper's tender soft downy tendril wOlmd itself around that sala tree.

Then the creeper enfolded ~e sala tree, made a canopy over it, draped a curtain all around It, and split the main branches of the tree.

Pessa, after paying homage to the Blessed One, sat down at one side, while Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side.538 Standing there, he surveyed the Sangha of bhikkhus sitting in complete silence,539 and then he said to the Blessed One: 2. \"It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how the Sangha of bhikkhus has been led to practise the right way by Master Gotama.

Soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, Pessa, the elephant driver's son, is wise, he has great wisdom. If he had sat a while longer until I had expounded for him in detail these four kinds of persons, he would have greatly benefited. Still he has already greatly bene-fited even as it is.''546 \"This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to expound in detail these four kinds of per-sons. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.\" \"Then, bhikkhus, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.\" \"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: 8. \"Bhikkhus, what kind of person torments himself and pur-sues the practice of torturing himself?547 Here a certain person goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an 'invitation to a meal; he receives nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying with a man, from where food is advertised to be distrib-uted, from where a dog is waiting, from where flies are buzzing; he accepts no fish or meat, he drinks no liquor, wine, or ferment-ed brew. He keeps to one house, to one morsel; he keeps to two houses to two morsels; ... he keeps to seven houses, to seven morsels. He lives on one saucerful a day, on two saucerfuls a day ... on seven saucerfuls a day. He takes food once a day, [343J once every two days ... once every seven days, and so on uP. to once every fortnight; he dwells pursuing the practice of ta~g food at stated intervals. He is an eater of greens or millet or wIld rice or hide-parings or moss or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamUJ11 flour or grass or cowdung. He lives on forest roots and fruits, he i344 To Kandaraka 447 feeds on fallen fruits. He clothes himself in hemp, in hemp-tnixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in kusa-grass fabric, in bark fab-ric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair wool, in animal wool, in owls' wings. He is one who pulls out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. He is one who stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is one who uses a mattress of spikes; he makes a mattress of spikes his bed. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. This is called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself. 9. \"What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments others and pur-sues the practice of torturing others? Here a certain person is a butcher of sheep, a butcher of pigs, a fowler, a trapper of wild beasts, a hunter, a fisherman, a thief, an executioner, a prison warden, or one who follows any other such bloody occupation. This is called the kind of person who torments others and pur-sues the practice of torturing others. 10. \"What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and also torments oth-ers and pursues the practice of torturing others? Here some per-Son is a head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin.548 Having had a new sacrificial temple built to the east of the city, and having shaved off his hair and beard, dressed himself in rough hide, and greased his body with ghee and oil, scratching his back with a deer's horn, he enters the sacrificial temple together with his chief queen and his brahmin high priest. There he lies down on the bare ground with the grass on it. The king lives on the milk in the first teat of a cow with a calf of the same colour [344] while the chief queen lives on the milk in the sec-ond teat and the brahmin high priest lives on the milk in the third teat; the milk in the fourth teat they pour onto the fire, and the calf lives on what is left. He says thus: 'Let so many bulls be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many bullocks be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many heifers be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many goats be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many sheep be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many trees be"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"448 Kandaraka Sutta: Sutta 51 i 345 felled for the sacrificial posts, let so much grass be cut for the sacrificial grass.' And then his slaves, messengers, and servants make preparations, weeping with tearful faces, being spurred on by threats of punishment and by fear. This is called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice of tor-turing himself and who torments others and pursues the prac-tice of torturing others. 11. \"What kind of person, bhikkhus, does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and does not torment others or pursue the practice of tormenting others - the one who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having himself become holy?549 12. \"Here, bhikkhus, a Tathagata appears in the world, accom-plished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and con-duct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has himself realised by direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right mean-ing and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is utterly per-fect and pure. 13. \"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other clan hears that· Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, he consid-ers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness.' On a later occa-sion, abandoning a small or a large fortune, [345] abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from the home life into homelessness. 14. \"Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life, abandoning the killing of living beings, he abstains from killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid i 346 To Kandaraka 449 aside, gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; taking only what is given, expect-ing only what is given, by not stealing he abides in purity. Abandoning incelibacy, he observes celibacy, living apart, abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse. \"Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of the world. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech; he does not repeat else-where what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and love-able, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many and agreeable to many. Abandoning gossip, he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial. \"He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He practises eat-ing only in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from danCing, singing, music, and theatrical shows.

Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, the bhikkhu becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggre-gate of noble virtue, he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless. 16. \"On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye fac-ulty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the body ... On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind fac-ulty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he experi-ences within himself a bfiss that is unsullied. 17. \"He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts in full awareness when flex-ing and extending his limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating and uri-nating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sit-ting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent. 18. \"Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and full awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw. i 347 To Kandaraka 451 19. \"On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness before him. [347] Abandoning covetous-ness for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt. 20. \"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfec-tions of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. 21. \"Again, WIth the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sus-tained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. 22. \"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, he abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling plea-sure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' 23. \"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. 24. \"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.

Nevertheless, I thought I would oppose the Blessed One thus since I desired to hear the Blessed One's varied solutions to the problem. Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir!

Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. i 380 To Upliii 485 Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to others' disciples.'

Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upali progres-sive instruction, that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the householder Upali's mind [380] was ready, recep-tive, free from hindrances, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so too, while the householder Upali sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: \"All that is subject to arising is subject to cessa-ti{)n.\"588 Then the householder Upali saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation.589 Then he said to the Blessed One: \"Now, vener-able sir, we must go. We are busy and have much to do.\" \"Now is the time, householder, to do as you think fit.\" 19. Then the householder Upali, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he left to return to his own house.

Now I shall go myself and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama.\" 22. Then the NigaDtha Nataputta went with a large assembly of NigaDthas to the householder Up ali's house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in the distance and told him: \"Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From today on the householder Up ali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama.

Now it is time to do as you think fit.\" 23. Then the householder Upali [383] went to the hall of the central door and sat down on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there.

But now, while seated himself on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat, he told NigaDtha Nataputta: \"Venerable sir, there are seats; sit down if you wish.\" 25.

If the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this gener-ation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time. As to this, venerable sir, I shall give you a simile; for some wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by a simile. i 385 To Upali 489 27. \"Venerable sir, there was once a brahmin who was old, aged, and burdened with years~ and he had as a wife a young brahmin girl who was pregnant and near her confinement. Then she told him: 'Go, brahmin, buy a young monkey in the market and bring it back to me as a playmate for my child.' He replied: 'Wait, madam, till you have borne the child. If you bear a boy, then I will go to the market and buy a young male monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for your little boy; but if you bear a girl, then I will go to the market and buy a young female monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for your little girl.' For the second time she made the same request and received the same answer. For the third time she made the same request. Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he went to the market, bought a young male monkey, brought it back, and told her: 'I have bought this young male monkey in the market [385] and brought it back to you as a playmate for your child.' Then she told him: 'Go, brahmin, take this young male monkey to RattapaDi the dyer's son and tell him: \"Good Rattapi3.I).i, I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.'\" Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he took the young male monkey to RattapaI).i the dyer's son and told him: 'Good RattapaDi, I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.' RattapaDi the dyer's son told him: 'Venerable sir, this young male monkey will take a dyeing but not a pounding or a smoothening out.' So too, venerable sir, the doctrine of the foolish NigaDthas will give delight to fools but not to the wise, and it will not withstand testing or being smoothened out. \"Then, venerable sir, on another occasion that brahmin took a pair of new garments to RattapaDi the dyer's son and told him: 'Good RattapaDi, I want this pair of new garments dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.'

Then Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic received the going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, [392] diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Seniya, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.

Thereupon the NigaDtha Nataputta said to him: 3. \"Come, prince, refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine, and a good report of you will be spread to this effect: 'Pr~ce Abhaya has refuted the doctrine of the recluse Gotama, who 1S so power-ful and mighty.'\" \"But how, venerable sir, shall I refute his doctrine?\" \"Come, prince, go to the recluse Gotama and say: 'Venerable sir, would the Tailiagata-utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others?'

After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side, looked at the sun, and thought: \"It is too late today to refute the Blessed One's doctrine. I shall refute the Blessed One's doctrine in my own house tomorrow.\" Then he said to the Bles-sed One: \"Venerable sir, let the Blessed One with three others consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.\" The Blessed One consented in silence. 5. Then; knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Prince Abhaya rose from his seat, and after paying homage to him, keeping him on his right, he departed. Then, when the night had ended, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went to Prince Abhaya's house and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, Prince Abhaya served and satisfied the Blessed One with vari-ous kinds of good food.

Now on that occasion the venerable Rahula was living at Ambalatthika.637 Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the venerable Rahula at Ambalatthika. The venerable Rahula saw the Blessed One com-ing in the distance and made a seat ready and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Rahula paid homage to him and sat down at one side. 3. Then the Blessed One left a little water in the water vessel and asked the venerable Rahula: \"Rahula, do you see this little water left in the water vessel?\" -\"Yes, venerable sir.\" -\"Even so little, Rahula, is the rec1useship of those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.\" 4.

So too, Rahula, when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I say, that one would not do. Therefore, Rahula, you should train thus: 'I will not utter a falsehood even as a joke.' 8. \"What do you think, Rahula?

When you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I wish to do with the body would lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it is an unwholesome bodily action with painful conse-quences, with painful results,' then you definitely should not do such an action with the body.

On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiD9ika's Park. 2. Therl, while the venerable Malunkyaputta was alone in meditation, the following thought arose in his mind: \"These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside and rejected by him, namely: 'the world is eternal' and 'the world is not eternal'; 'the world is finite' and 'the world is infinite'; 'the soul is the same as the body' and 'the soul is one thing and the body another'; and 'after death a Tathagata exists' and 'after death a Tathagata does not exist' and 'after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist' and 'after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.' The Blessed One does not declare these to me, and I do not approve of and accept the fact that he does not declare these to me, so I shall go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of this. If he declares to me either 'the world is eternal' or 'the world is not eternal' ... or 'after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist,' then I will lead the holy life under him; if he does not declare these to me, then I will abandon the training and return to the low life.\" [427] . 3. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Malunkyaputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him: \"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the fol-lowing thought arose in my mind: 'These speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One ...

[430] \"All this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die.

Thereupon, the venerable Ananda said: ''It is the time, Blessed One, it is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the five lower fetters. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.\" \"Then listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say.\" \"Yes, venerable sir,\" the venerable Ananda replied. The Blessed One said this: 5. \"Here, Ananda, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from the arisen personality view; and when that personality view has become habitual and is uneradi-cated in him, it is a lower fetter.

Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, it is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without cutting through its bark and sap-wood, so too, there is a path ... this is not possible. \"There is a path, Ananda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters; [435] that someone, by coming to that path, to that way, sha~l know and see and abandon the five lower fetters -this is possible.

So too, when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessa-tion of personality, if his mind does not enter into it and acquire confidence, steadiness, and decision, then he can be regarded as like the feeble man. \"Suppose, ~da, the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it, and then a strong man came thinking: 'By swimming across the stream with my arms, I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges'; and he would. be able to get safely across. So too, when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of per-sonality, if his mind enters into it and acquires confidence, steadi-ness, and decision, then he can be regarded as like the strong man. 9. \"And what, Ananda, is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters? Here, with seclusion from objects of attachment,654 with the abandoning of unwholesome states, with the complete tranquillization of bodily inertia, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"540 Mahamalunkyaputta Sutta: Sutta 64 i 436 and pleasure born of seclusion. .. \"Whatever exists therein of material form, feelmg, perceptIon, formations, and consciousness, he sees those states as imperma-nent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self.655 He turns his mind away from those states [436] and directs it towards the deathless element thus: 'This is the peace-ful, this is the sublime, that is, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbana.'656 Standing upon th~t, he attains the destruction of the taints.

Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known.' Then, after he has gone forth thus, his companions in the holy life advise and instruct him thus: 'You should move to and fro thus; you should look ahead and look away thus; you should flex and extend the limbs thus; you should wear the patched cloak, bowl, and robes thus.' Then he thinks: 'Formerly, when we were in the home life, we advised and instructed others, and now these [bhikkhus], who seem like they might be our sons or our grandsons, think that they can advise and instruct us.' And so he forsakes the training and reverts to the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of waves. Now 'waves' is a term for angry despair. 17. \"What, bhikkhus, is fear of crocodiles?

Then, after he has gone forth thus, his com-panions in the holy life advise and instruct him thus: 'This can be consumed by you, this cannot be consumed by you; this can be eaten by you, this cannot be eaten by you; this can be tasted by you, this cannot be tasted by you; this can be drunk by you, this: ';"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"564 Catuma Sutta: Sutta 67 i 461 cannot be drunk by yoU.686 You can consume what is allowable, you cannot consume what is not allowable; you can eat what is allowable, you cannot eat what is not allowable; you can taste what is allowable, you cannot taste what is not allowable; you can drink what is allowable, you cannot drink what is not allow-able.

He sees some householder there or householder's son furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure enjoying him-self with them. He considers thus: 'Formerly, when we were in the home life, we were furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure and we enjoyed ourselves with them. My family has wealth; I can both enjoy wealth and make merit.' And so he forsakes the training and reverts to the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of whirlpools. Now 'whirlpools' is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure. 19. \"What, bhikkhus, is fear of sharks?

He sees a woman there lightly clothed, lightly dressed. When he sees such a woman, lust infects his mind. Because his mind has been infected by lust, he forsakes the training and reverts to the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of sharks. Now 'sharks' is a term for women. 20. \"Bhikkhus, these are the four kinds of fears to be expected by certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness in this Dhamma and Discipline.\" That is what the Blessed One said.

It is not because 566 i464 At Nalakapana 567 you have been driven by kings that you have gone forth from the home life into homelessness, or because you have been driven by thieves, or owing to debt, fear, or want of a livelihood. Rather, did you not go forth out of faith from the home life into home-lessness after considering thus: 'I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering.

It is hard for you to understand it when you hold another view, accept another teaching, approve of another teaching, pur-sue a different training, and follow a different teacher. So I shall question you about this in return, Vaccha. Answer as you choose. 19. \"What do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you.

It should be regarded as impermane~t, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, a~ a calarruty, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as vOld, as not self. When one regards this body thus; one abandons desire for the body, affection for the body, subservien~e to the bo~y. 10. \"There are, Aggivessana, three kinds of feelmg: plea~ant feeling, painful feelihg, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelmg. On the occasion when one feels pleasant feeling, one does ~ot feel painful feeling or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling;. on that occasion one feels only pleasant feeling.

Painful feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanish-ing, fading aw~y, and ceasing. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and ceasing. 12. \"Seeing thus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disen-chanted with pleasant feeling, disenchanted with painful feeling, disenchanted with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.' 13. \"A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus, Aggivessana, sides with none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in the world without adhering to it.\"737 14. Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was stand-ing behind the Blessed One, [501] fanning him. Then he thought: \"The Blessed One, indeed, speaks of the abandoning of these things through direct knowledge; the Sublime One, indeed, speaks of the relinquishing of these things through direct knowl-edge.\" As the venerable Sariputta considered this, through not clinging his mind was liberated from the taints.738 15. But in the wanderer Dlghanakha the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose: \"All that is subject to arising is sub-ject to cessation.\" The wanderer DIghanakha saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation.739 16. Then he said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\" 75 Magandiya Sutta To Magandiya 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma, on a spread of grass in the fire chamber of a brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clan. 2. Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Kammasadhamma for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Kammasadhamma and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to a certain grove for the day's abiding. Having entered the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day's abiding. [502] 3. Then the wanderer Magandiya, while walking and wan-dering for exercise, went to the fire chamber of the brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja clan. There he saw a spread of grass prepared and asked the brahmin: \"For whom has this spread of grass been prepared in Master Bharadvaja's fire chamber? It seems like a recluse's bed.\" 4. \"Master Magandiya, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who went forth from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incompa-rable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' This bed has been prepared for that Master Gotama.\" 5. \"Indeed, Master Bharadvaja, it is an ill sight we see when we see the bed of that destroyer of growth,740 Master Gotama.\" \"Be careful what you say, Magandiya, be careful what you say! Many learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned house-holders, and learned recluses have full confidence in Master 607"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"608 Magandiya Sutta: Sutta 75 i 503 Gotama, and have been disciplined by him in the noble true way, in the Dhamma that is wholesome.\" \"Master Bharp.dvaja, even if we saw that Master Gotama face to face, we would tell him to his face: 'The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.' Why is that? Because that is recorded in our scriptures.\" \"If Master Magandiya has no objection, may I tell this to Master Gotama?\" \"Let Master Bharadvaja be at ease. Tell him just what I have said.\" 6. Meanwhile, with the divine ear, which is purified and sur-passes the human, the Blessed One heard this conversation between the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan and the wanderer Magandiya. Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation, went to the brahmin's fire chamber, and sat down on the spread of grass made ready. Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked him: \"Bharadvaja, did you have any conversation with the wanderer Magandiya [503] about this spread of grass?\" When this was said,-the brahmin, awestruck and with his hair standing on end, replied: \"We wanted to tell Master Gotama about that very thing, but Master Gotama has anticipated us.\" 7. But this discussion between the Blessed One and the brah-min of the Bharadvaja clan was left unfinished, for then the wanderer Magandiya, while walking and wandering for exer-cise, came to the brahmin's fire chamber and went up to the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him: 8. \"Magandiya, the eye delights in forms, takes delight in forms, rejoices in forms; that has been tamed by the Tathagata, guarded, protected, and restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for its restraint. Was it with reference to this that you said: 'The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth'?\" \"It was with reference to this, Master Gotama, that I said: 'The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.'

Then at that point the Blessed One uttered this exclamation: \"The greatest of all gains is health, Nibbana is the greatest bliss, The eightfold path is the best of paths For it leads safely to the Deathless.\" When this was said, the wanderer Magandiya said to the Blessed One: \"It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how well that has been expressed by Master Gotama: [509] 'The greatest of all gains is health, Nibbana is the greatest bliss.'"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"614 Magandiya Sutta: Sutta 75 i 510 We too have heard this said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the teachers, and it agrees, Master Gotama.\" \"But, Magandiya, when you heard that said by earlier wan-derers in the tradition of the teachers, what is that health, what is that Nibbana?\" When this was said, the wanderer Magandiya rubbed his limbs with his hands and said: \"This is that health, Master Gotama, this is that Nibbana; for I am now healthy and happy and nothing afflicts me.\"744 20. \"Magandiya, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms, who could not see blue, yel-low, red, or pink forms, who could not see what was even and uneven, who could not see the stars or the sun and moon.

Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus: 'Good man, here is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.' And he would accept it and put it on, and being satisfied with it, he would utter words of satisfaction thus: 'Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!'

Then perhaps you might think: 'Indeed, I have long been tricked, cheated, and defrauded by this mind.

So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama eats little and commends eating little,' then those disci-ples of mine who live on a cupful of food ... should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. \"Suppose, Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me, and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe.' Now there are disciples of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse robes; they collect rags from the charnel ground, rubbish heaps, or shops, make them into patched robes, and wear them. But I sometimes wear robes given by householders, robes so fine that pumpkin hair is coarse in comparison. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe,' then those disciples of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse robes ... should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, honour-ing and respecting me. \"Suppose, Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me, and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood.'

Now there are disciples of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air dwellers, who do not use a roof for eight months [of the year], while I sometimes live in gabled mansions plastered within and without, protected against the wind, secured by door bolts, with shuttered win-dows. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place,' then those diSciples of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air dwellers ... should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, hon-ouring and respectmg me. \"Suppose, Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me, and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion.' Now there are disciples of mine who are forest d~ellers, dwellers in remote resting places, who live withdrawn in remote jungle-thicket resting places and return to the midst of the Sangha once each half-month for the recitation of the Patimokkha. But I sometimes live surrounded by bhikkhus and bhikkhunIs, by men and women lay followers, by kings and kings' ministers, by other sectarians and their dis-ciples. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion,' [9] then those disciples of mine who are forest dwellers ... should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respect-ing me. Thus, Udayin, it is not because of these five qualities that my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. ii 10 The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayin 635 10. \"However, Udayin, there are five other qualities because of which my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me.

KNOWLEDGE AND VISION) 12. \"Again, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision thus: 'When the recluse Gotama says \"I know,\" he truly knows; when he says \"I see,\" he truly sees. The recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma through direct knowl-edge, not without direct knowledge; he teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis, not without a sound basis; he teaches the Dhamma in a convincing manner, not in an unconvincing man-ner.'

Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of suffering, and I satisfy their minds with my explanation.

Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, and I satis-fy their minds with my explanation.

II Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight liberations?64 Possessed of material form, one sees forms: this is the first liberation. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally: this is the second libera-tion. One is resolved only upon the beautiful: this is the third liberation. [13] With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite,' one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space: this is the fourth liberation. By completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness: this is the fifth liberation. By completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' one enters ii 14 The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayin 639 upon and abides in the base of nothingness: this is the sixth liber-ation.

By completely sur-mounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling: this is the eighth liberation. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge. (9. The Eight Bases for Transcendence) 23. /I Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight bases for transcendence?65 Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the first base for transcendence?66 Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, immeasurable, fair and ugly; by tran-scending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the second base for transcendence. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair and ugly; by transcend-ing them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the third base for transcendence?67 Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, immeasurable, fair and ugly; by tran-scending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fourth base for transcendence. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, blue, of blue colour, blue in appear-ance, with blue luminosity.

The Four Jhanas) 25. \"Agairi, Udayiri, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four jhanas. Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the· first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustairied thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclu-sion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion?69 Just as a skilled bath man or a bath man's apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basiri and, spririklirig it gradually with water, kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. 26. \"Agairi, with the stillirig of applied and sustairied thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has self-confidence and sirigleness of mind without applied and sustairied thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentra-tion. He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration. Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below and it had no inflow from east, west, north, or south [16] and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rairi, then the cool fount of water wellirig up iri the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and. pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration. 27. \"Agairi, with the fadirig away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides iri equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides iri the third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abidirig who has equanimity and is miridful.'

Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses Wlper-vaded by cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body Wlpervaded by the plea-sure divested of rapture. 28. \"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth; so too, a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body [17] Wlpervaded by the pure bright mind. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge. (12. Insight Knowledge) 29. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my diSCiples the way to understand thus:770 'This body of mine, made of material form, consisting of the four great elements, procreated by a mother and father, and built up out of boiled rice and porridge, is subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration, and this consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with it.' Suppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all good qualities, and through it a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread would be strWlg. Then a man with good sight, taking it in his hand, might review it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all good qualities, and ii 18 The Greater Discourse to sakuludayin 643 through it is StrWlg a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.'

The Mind-made Body) 30. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create from this body another body having form, mind-made, with all its limbs, lacking no faculty. Just as though a man were to pull out a reed from its sheath and think thus: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another; it is from the sheath that the reed has been pulled out'; or just as though a man were to pull out a sword from its scabbard and think thus: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard; the sword is one, the scabbard another; it is from the scabbard that the sword has been pulled out'; [18] or just as though a man were to pull a snake out of its slough and think thus: 'This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake is one, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has been pulled out.'

The Kinds of Supernormal Power) 31. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, they become many; having been many, they become one; they appear and vanish; they go unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains, as though through space; they dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; they walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seat-ed cross-legged, they travel in space like birds; with their hands they touch and stroke the moon and SWl so powerful and mighty; they wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.

Understanding the Minds of Others) , 33. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand the minds of other beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with their own minds. They understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; they understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; they understand a mind affected py delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; they understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; they understand a swpassed mind as swpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsur-passed; they understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; they understand ii 21 The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayiri 645 a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unlib-erated. Just as a man or a woman - young, youthful, and fond of ornaments -on viewing the image of his or her own face in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know if there were a spot thus: 'There is a spot,' [20] or would know if there were no spot thus: 'There is no spot'; so too, I have pro-claimed to my disciples the way to understand ... an unliberated mind as unliberated. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge. (17. The Recollection of Past Lives) 34. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to recollect their manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named ... and passing away from there, I reappeared here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past lives. Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and then back again to his own village.

They understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of depriva-tion, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is puri-fied and surpasses the human, they see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and they understand how beings pass on according to their actions. Just as though there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering the houses and coming out and pass-ing to and fro.

The Destruction of the Taints) 36. \"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, they here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruc-tion of the taints. Just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and undisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting.

Here comes the carpenter Pancakanga, a diSciple of the recluse Gotama, one of the recluse Gotama's white-clothed lay disciples staying at SavatthI. These venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.\" Then the wanderers became silent. 4. The carpenter Pancakanga went to the wanderer Uggahamana and exchanged greetings with him. [24] When this 648 ii 25 Sama1Jama1Jejikaputta 649 courteous and amiable talk waS finished, he sat down at one side. The wanderer Uggahamana then said to him: 5. \"Carpenter, when a man possesses four qualities, I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible. What are the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions, he utters no evil speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not make his living by any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these four qualities, I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible.\" 6. Then the carpenter Pancakanga neither approved nor disap-proved ofthe wanderer Uggahamana's words. Without doing either he rose from his seat and went away, thinking: \"I shall learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed One.\" 7. Then he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the wanderer Uggahamana. There-upon the Blessed One said: 8. \"If that were so, carpenter, then a young tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible, according to the wanderer Uggahamana's statemen~'. For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion 'body,' so how should he do an evil action beyond mere wriggling? A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion' speech,' so how should he utter evil speech beyond mere whining? A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion 'intention,' so how should he have evil intentions beyond mere sulking? A young tendet infant lying prone does not even have the notion 'livelihood,' so how [25] should he make his living by evil livelihood beyond being suckled at his mother's breast?

But those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge -it is they who would know what sensuality is, what sensual plea-sure is, and what the pleasure higher than the sensual is.\" 15. When this was said, the wanderer Vekhanassa was angry and displeased, and he reviled, disparaged, and censured the Blessed One, saying: \"The recluse Gotama will be worsted.\" He then said to the Blessed One: \"So then there are some recluses and brahmins here who, without knowing the past and without seeing the future, yet claim: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to. be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.' What they say turns out to be ridiculous; it turns out to be mere words, empty and hollow.\" 16. \"If any recluses and brahmins [44], without knowing the past and without seeing the future, yet claim: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' they can be confuted in accordance with the Dhamma. Rather, let the past be, Kaccana, and let the future be. Let a wise man come, one who is honest and sincere, a man of rectitude. I instruct him, I teach him the Dhamma in such a way that by practising as instructed he will soon know and see for himself: 'Thus, indeed, there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond, that is, from the bond of ignorance.' Suppose, Kaccana, there were a young tender infant lying prone, bound by stout bonds [at the four ii 44 To Vekhanassa 665 limbs] with the fifth at the neck; and later on, as a result of his growth and the maturing of his faculties, those bonds loosened, then he would know 'I am free' and there would be no more bondage. So too, let a wise man come ... 'Thus, indeed, there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond, that is, from the bond of ignorance.'\" 17. When this was said, the wanderer Vekhanassa said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear ... (as Sutta 79, §19) ... for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. 2. Then in a certain place beside the main road the Blessed One smiled. It occurred to the venerable Ananda: \"What is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tatha-gatas do not smile for no reason.\" So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential saluta-tion towards the Blessed One, asked him: \"Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no reason.\" 3. \"Once, Ananda, in this place there was a prosperous and busy market town called Vebhalinga, with many inhabitants and crowded with people.

It was here, in fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, had his monastery; it was here, in fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, resided and advised the Sangha of bhikkhus.\" 4. Then the venerable Ananda folded his patchwork cloak in four, and spreading it out, said to the Blessed One: \"Then, vener-' able sir, l~t the Blessed One be seated.

Ghatlkara the potter had as a friend, as his close friend, a brahmin student named Jotipala790 \"One day the potter Ghapkara addressed the brahmin student Jotipala thus: 'My dear Jotipala, let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlight-ened.' The brahmin student Jotipala replied: 'Enough, my dear Ghatlkara, what is the use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?' \"A second and third time the potter Ghatlkara said: 'My dear J otipala, let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accom-plished and fully enlightened.

Then the brahmin student Jotipala undid his belt and said: 'Enough, my dear Ghatlkara, what is the use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?' 9. \"Then, when the brahmin student Jotipala had washed his head, the potter Ghapkara seized him by the hair and said:792 'My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite nearby. Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened.

Ghapkara, after paying homage to him, sat down at one side, while Jotipala exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he too sat down at one side.

And the brahmin student Jotipala received the going forth from the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, and he received the full admission.793 13. \"Then not long after Jotipala the brahmin student had received the full admission, a half-month after he had received the full admission, the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, having stayed at Vebhalinga as long as he chose, set out to wander towards Benares. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at Benares, and there he went to live in the Deer Park at Isipatana: 14;. \"Now King KikI of Kasi heard: 'It seems that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, has reached Benares and is living in the Deer Park at Isipatana.' So he had a number of state carriages made ready, and moqnting a state car-riage, drove out from Bepares with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he got down from his carriage and went for-ward on foot to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged King KikI of Kasi with an exposition of the Dhamma. 15. \"At the conclusion of the exposition, King KikI of Kasi said: [50] 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.' And the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, accepted in silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, had accepted, ii 51 Ghatrkara the Potter 673 he rose from his sea t and after paying homage to him, keeping him on his right, he departed. 16. \"Then, when the night had ended, King KikI of Kasi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own dwelling - red rice stored in the sheaf with the dark grains picked out, along with many sauces and curries -and he had the time announced to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlight-ened, thus: 'It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.' 17. \"Then, it being morning, the Blessed One Kassapa, accom-plished and fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the dwelling of King KikI of Kasi and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, King KikI of Kasi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One Kassapa, accom-plished and fully enlightened, had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, King KikI of Kasi took a low seat, sat down at one side and said: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One accept .from me a residence for the Rains in Benares; that will be helpful for the Sangha.' - 'Enough, king, my residence for the Rains has already been provided for.' \"A second and a third time King KikI of Kasi said: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares; that will be helpful for the Sangha.' - 'Enough, king, my residence for the Rains has already been provided for.' \"The king thought: 'The Blessed One Kassapa, [51] accom-plished and fully enlightened, does not accept from me a resi-dence for the Rains in Benares,' and he was very disappointed and sad. 18. \"Then he said: 'Venerable sir, have you a better supporter than I am?' - 'I have, great king. There is a market town called Vebhalinga where a potter named Ghatlkara lives. He is my supporter, my chief supporter. Now you, great king, thought: \"The Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares,\" and you were very disappointed and sad; but the potter Ghap-kara is not and will not be so.

He is free from doubt about suffering, about the ori-gin of suffering, about the cessation of suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering. He eats only in one part of the day, he observes celibacy, he is virtuous, of good character. He has laid aside gems and gold, he has given up gold and silver. He does not dig the ground for clay using a pick with his own hand; what is left over from embankments or thrown up by rats, he brings home in a carrier; when he has made a pot he says: \"Let anyone who likes set down some selected rice or selected beans or selected lentils, and let him take away whatever he likes.\"794 He supports his blind and aged parents.

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a Kuru town named Thullakotthita. 2. The brahmin householders of Thullakotthita heard: \"The recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the Kuru country [55] with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Thullakotthita. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants.\" 3. Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; sorrie extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some pro-nounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at one side.

They then rose from their [56] seats, and after paying homage to him, they departed, keeping him on their right. 6. Soon after they had gone, the clansman Ratthapala went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.

Now if you do not give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness, he will die there. But if you give him your per-mission, you will see him after he has gone forth. And if he does not enjoy the going forth, what else can he do then but return here? So give him your permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness.\" \"Then, dears, we give the clansman Ratthapala permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness.

Your parents permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness. But when you have gone forth, you must visit your parents.\" 12. The clansman Ratthapala then got up, and when he had regained his strength, he went to the Blessed One, and after pay-ing homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him: \"Venerable sir, I have my parents' permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness. Let the Blessed One give me the going forth.\" Then the clansman RaHhapala received the going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the full admission.796 13. Then not long after the venerable Ratthapala had received the full admission, a half-month after he had received the full ii 62 On Ratthaplila 681 admission, the Blessed One, having stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he chose, set out to wander towards SavatthI. Wan-dering by stages, he eventually arrived at SavatthI, and there [61] he lived at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiI:l<;lika's Park. 14. Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent,and resolute, the venerable RaHhapala, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen right-ly go forth from the home life into homelessness?97 He directly knew: \"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" And the venerable RaHhapala became one of the arahants. 15. Then the venerable Ratthapala went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him: \"Venerable sir, I wish to visit my parents, if I have the Blessed One's permission.\" Then the Blessed One penetrated mentally the thoughts in venerable Ratthapala's mind. When he knew that the clansman Ratthapala was incapable of abandoning the training and returning to the low life, he told him: \"Now is the time, Ratthapala, to do as you think fit.\" 16. Then the venerable Ratthapala rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, he departed, keeping him on his right. He then set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer robe, set out to wander towards ThullakoHhita. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita. There he lived in Thullakotthita in King Koravya's Migaclra Garden. Then, when it was morning, he dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into ThullakoHhita for alms. As he was wandering for alms from house to house in ThullakoHhita, he came to his own father's house. 17. Now on that occasion the venerable RaHhapala's father was sitting in the hall of the central door having his hair dressed. When he saw the venerable Ratthapala coming in the distance, he said: \"Our only son, dear and beloved, was made to go forth by these bald-pated recluses.\" [62] Then at his own father's house the venerable RaHhapala received neither alms nor a polite refusal; instead, he received only abuse. 18.

Then she went to his mother and said: \"Please know, my lady, that my lord's son Ratthapala has arrived.\" \"Gracious! If what you say is true, you are no longer a slave!\" Then the venerable Ratthapala's mother went to his father and said: \"Please know, householder, they say that the clansman Ratthapala has arrived.\" 19. Just then the venerable Ratthapala was eating the old por-ridge by the wall of a certain shelter. His father went to him and said: \"Ratthapala, my dear, surely there is ... and you will be eat-ing old porridge!799 Is there not your own house to go to?\" \"How could we have a house, householder, when we have gone forth from the home life into homelessness? We are home-less, householder. We went [63] to your house, but we received neither alms nor a polite refusal there; instead we received only abuse.\" \"Come, dear RaHhapala, let us go to the house.\" \"Enough, householder, my meal for today is finished.\" \"Then, dear Ratthapala, consent to accept tomorrow's meal.\" The venerable Ratthapala consented in silence. 20. Then, knowing that the venerable Ratthapala had consent-ed, his father went bacl~ to his own house where he had gold coins and bullion made into a large heap and covered it with mats. Then he told the venerable Ratthapala's former wives: \"Come, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves with ornaments in the way Ratthapala found you most dear and loveable.\" 21. When night had ended, the venerable Ratthapala's father had good food of various kinds prepared in his own house and had the time announced to the venerable Ratthapala: \"It is time, dear Ratthapala, the meal is ready.\" 22. Then, it being morning, the venerable Ratthapala dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went to his own father's house and sat down on the seat made ready. Then his father had the pile of gold coins and bullion uncovered and said: \"Dear Ratthapala, this is your maternal fortune; your paternal fortune is another and your ancestral fortune is yet another. Dear Ratthapala, you can enjoy the wealth and make merit. Corne ii 65 On Ratthapaia 683 then, dear, [64] abandon the training and return to the low life, enjoy the wealth and make merit.\" \"Householder, if you would follow my advice, then have this pile of gold coins and bullion loaded on carts and carried away to be dumped midstream in the river Ganges. Why is that? Because, householder, on account of this there will arise for you sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.\" 23. Then the venerable Ratthapala's former wives clasped his feet and said to him: \"What are they like, my lord's son, the nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life?\" \"We do not lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs, sisters.\" \"Our lord's son Ratthapala calls us 'sisters,\"' they cried and right there they fainted. 24. Then the venerable Ratthapala told his father: \"Householder, if there is a meal to be given, then give it. Do not harass us.\" \"Eat then, dear Ratthapala, the meal is ready.\" Then, with his own hands, the venerable Ratthapala's father served and satisfied him with the various kinds of good food. When the venerable Ratthapala had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, he stood up and uttered these stanzas: 25. \"Behold a puppet here pranked out,BOO A body built up out of sores, Sick, an object for concern, Where no stability abides. Behold a figure here pranked out With jewellery and earrings too, A skeleton wrapped up in skin, Made attractive by its clothes. Its feet adorned with henna dye And powder smeared upon its face: It may beguile a fool, but not A seeker of the further shore. [65] Its hair is dressed in eightfold plaits And unguent smeared upon its eyes: It may beguile a fool, but not A seeker of the further shore."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"684 Ratthapttla Sutta: Sutta 82 A filthy body well adorned Like a new-painted unguent pot: It may beguile a fool, but not A seeker of the further shore. The deer-hunter set out the snare But the deer did not spring the trap; We ate the bait and now depart Leaving the hunters to lament.\" ii 66 26. After the venerable Ratthapala had stood up and uttered these stanzas, he went to King Koravya's Migaclra garden and sat down at the root of a tree for the day's abiding. 27. Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus: \"Good gamekeeper, tidy up the Migaclra Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot.\" -\"Yes, sire,\" he replied. Now while he was tidying up the MigacIra Garden, the gamekeeper saw the venerable Ratthapala seated at the root of a tree for the day's abiding. When he saw him, he went to King Koravya and told him: \"Sire, the MigacIra Garden has been tidied up. The clansman Ratthapala is there, the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita, of whom you have always spoken highly;801 he is seated at the root of a tree for the day's abiding.\" \"Then, good Migava, enough of the pleasure garden for today. Now we shall go to pay respects to that Master Ratthapala.\" 28. Then, saying: \"Give away all the food that has been pre-pared there,\" King Koravya had a number of state carriages pre-pared, and mounting one of them, accompanied by the other carriages, he drove out from Thullakotthita with the full pomp of royalty to see the venerable Ratthapala. He drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to where the v~nerable Ratthapala was. [66] He exchanged greetings with the venerable Rattha-pala, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side and said: \"Here is an elephant rug. Let Master Ratthapala be seated on it.\" \"There is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat.\" ii 67 On Ratthapttla 685 King Koravya sat down on a seat made ready and said: 29. \"Master Ratthapala, there are four kinds of loss.

Greedily they hoard away their riches Longing still for further sensual pleasures. A king who has conquered the earth by force And rules over the land the ocean bounds Is yet unsated with the sea's near shore And hungers for its further shore as well.

His relatives lament and rend their hair, Crying, ' Ah me! Alas! Our love is dead!' They bear away the body wrapped in shrouds To place it on a pyre and bum it there. Clad in a shroud, he leaves his wealth behind, Prodded with stak~s he burns [upon the pyre]. And as he dies, no relatives or friends Can offer him shelter and refuge here. While his heirs take over his wealth, this being Must pass on according to his actions; And as he dies nothing can follow him; Not child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estate. Longevity is not acquired with wealth Nor can prosperity banish old age; Short is this life, as all the sages say, Eternity it knows not, only change. ii 74 On Ratthapilla 691 The rich and poor alike shall feel [Death's] touch, The fool and sage as well shall feel it too; But while the fool lies stricken by his folly, No sage will ever tremble at the touch. Better is wisdom here than any wealth, Since by wisdom one gains the final goal. For people through ignorance do evil deeds While failing to reach the goal from life to life. As one goes to the womb and the next world, Renewing the successive round of births, Another of little wisdom, trusting him, Goes also to the womb and the next world. [74] Just as a robber caught in burglary Is made to suffer for his evil deed, So people after death, in the next world, Are made to suffer for their evil deeds. Sensual pleasures, varied, sweet, delightful, In many different ways disturb the mind: Seeing the danger in these sensual ties I chose to lead the homeless life, 0 King. As fruits fall from the tree, so people too, Both young and old, fall when this body breaks.

On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove, the Deer Park. 2. Now on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recent-ly been built for Prince BOOhi, and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or any human being at all.816 3. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Safijikaputta thus: \"Come, my dear Safijikaputta, go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: 'Venerable sir, Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness ... and abiding in comfort.' Then say this: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha·of bhikkhus con-sent to accept tomorrow'-s meal from Prince Bodhi.\"' \"Yes, sir,\" Safijikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.

Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Safijikaputta rose from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and told him what had happened [92], adding: \"The recluse Gotama has consented.\" 5. Then, when the night had ended, Prince Bodhi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had 704 ii 93 To Prince Bodhi 705 the Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he addressed the brahmin student Safijikaputta thus: \"Come, my dear Safijikaputta, go to the Blessed One and announce that it is time thus: 'It is time, vener-able sir, the meal is ready. \"' \"Yes, sir,\" Safijikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and announced that it was time thus: \"It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.\" 6. Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went to Prince Bodhi's residence. 7. Now on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch waiting for the Blessed One. When he saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, he went out to meet him and paid homage to him; and then, allowing the Blessed One to precede him, he proceeded to the Kokanada Palace. But the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of the staircase. Prince Bodhi said to him: \"Venerable sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.\" When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.817 A second time ... A third time Prince Bodhi said to him: \"Venerable sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.\" The Blessed One looked at the venerable Ananda. [93] The venerable Ananda said to Prince Bodhi: \"Prince, let the cloth be removed. The Blessed One will not step on a strip of cloth; the Tathagata has regard for future generations.\"818 8. So Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed, and he had seats prepared in the upper apartments of the Kokanada Palace. The Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the seats that had been prepared. 9. Then, with his own hands, Prince Bodhi served and satis-fied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, we have thought thus: 'Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.\"'819"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"706 Bodhiriijakumiira Sutta: Sutta 85 ii 94 10. \"Prince, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too thought thus: 'Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.' 11-14. \"Later, prince, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life ...

I shall never be able to put him down, venerable sir.\" 11. \"Great king, suppose you were to see that Angulimala had shaved off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and gone ii 102 On Angulimala 713 forth from the home life into homelessness; that he was abstain-ing from killing living beings, from taking what is not given and from false speech; that he was refraining from eating at night, ate only in one part of the day, and was celibate, virtuous, of good character. If you were to see him thus, how would you treat him?\"· \"Venerable sir, we would pay homage to him, or rise up for him, or invite him to be seated; or we would invite him to accept robes, almsfood, a resting place, or medicinal requisites; or we would arrange for him lawful guarding, defence, and protection. But, venerable sir, he is an immoral man, one of evil character. How could he li!ver have such virtue and restraint?\" 12. Now on ·that occasion the venerable Angulimala was sit-ting not far from the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One extended his right arm and said to King Pasenadi of Kosala: \"Great king, this is Angulimala.\" Then King Pasenadi was frightened, alarmed, and terrified. Knowing this, the Blessed One told him: \"Do not be afraid, great king, do not be afraid. There is nothing for you to fear from him.\" Then the king's fear, [102] alarm, and terror subsided. He went over to the venerable Angulimala and said: \"Venerable sir, is the noble lord really Angulimala?\" \"Yes, great king.\" \"Venerable sir, of what family is the noble lord's father? Of what family is his mother?\" \"My father is a Gagga, great king; my mother is a MantaDi.\" \"Let the noble lord Gagga MantaDiputta rest content. I shall provide robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites for the noble lord Gagga MantaDiputta.\" 13. Now at that time the venerable Angulimala was a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a refuse-rag wearer, and restricted himself to three robes. He replied: \"Enough, great king, my triple robe is complete.\" King Pasenadi then returned to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: \"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous how the Blessed One tames the untamed, brings peace to the unpeaceful, and leads to Nibbana those who have not attained Nibbana.

Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into SavatthI for alms. As he was wandering for alms from house to house in SavatthI, he saw a certain woman giving birth to a deformed child. [103] When he saw this, he thought: \"How beings are afflicted! Indeed, how beings are afflicted!\" When he had wandered for alms in SavatthI and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: \"Venerable sir, in the morning I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, went into SavatthI for alms.

By this truth, may you be well and may your infant be well!\" Then the woman and the infant became well. 16. Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Angulimala, by realiSing for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which ii 104 On Angulimala 715 clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew: \"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more com-ing to any state of being.\" [104] And the venerable Angulimala became one of the arahants. 17. Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. Now on that occasion someone threw a clod and hit the venerable Angulimala's body, someone else threw a stick and hit his body, and someone else threw a potsherd and hit his body. Then, with blood running from his cut head, with his bowl bro-ken, and with his outer robe tom, the venerable Angulimala went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and told him: \"Bear it, brahmin! Bear it, brahmin! You are experiencing here and now the result of deeds because of which you might have been tortured in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years.\"824 18. Then, while the venerable Angulimala was alone in retreat experiencing the bliss of deliverance, he uttered this exclamation:825 \"Who once did live in negligence And then is negligent no more, He illuminates the world Like the moon freed from a cloud. Who checks the evil deeds he did By doing wholesome deeds instead, He illuminates the world Like the moon freed from a cloud. The youthful bhikkhu who devotes His efforts to the Buddha's teaching, He illuminates the world Like the moon freed from a cloud.

For surely then they would not wish to harm me, Nor would they think of harming other beings, So those who would prot~ct all, frail or strong, Let them attain the all-surpassing peace. Conduit-makers guide the water, Fletchers straighten out the arrow-shaft, Carpenters straighten out the timber, But wise men seek to tame themselves.

Prostrating himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, he covered the Blessed One's feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands, pronouncing his name: \"I am King Pasenaj:li of Kosala, venerable sir; I am King Pasenadi of Kosala, venerable sir.\" \"But, great king, what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to this body and for showing such friendship?\" 10. \"Venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: 'The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the.

But here I see bhikkhus leading the perfect and pure holy life as long as life and breath last. Indeed, I do not see any other holy life else-where as perfect and pure as this. This is why, venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: 'The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practis-ing the good way.' 11. \"Again, venerable sir, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, householders with house-holders; mother quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child, child with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.838 But here I see bhikkhus living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, [121] viewing each other with kindly eyes. I do not see any other assembly elsewhere with such concord.

I have thought: 'Surely these venerable ones are leading the holy life in discontent, or they have done some evil deed and are concealing it, so lean and wretched are they ... such that people would not want to look at them again.' I went up to them and asked: 'Why are you vener-able ones so lean and wretched ... such that people would not want to look at you again?' Their reply was: 'It is our family sickness, great king.' But here I see bhikkhus smiling and cheer-ful, sincerely joyful, plainly delighting, their faculties fresh, liv-ing at ease, unruffled, subsisting on what others give, abiding with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer's. I have thought: 'Surely ii 122 Monuments to the Dhamma 731 these venerable ones perceive successive states of lofty distinc-tion in the Blessed One's Dispensation, since they abide thus smiling and cheerful...with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer's.'

Yet when I am sitting in council, they break in and inter-rupt me. Though I say: 'Gentlemen, do not break in and inter-rupt me when I am sitting in council; wait till the end of my speech,' still they break in and interrupt me. But here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is teaching the Dhamma839 to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing his throat. Once the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers and there a disciple of his cleared his throat. Thereupon one of his com-panions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate: 'Be quiet, venerable sir, make no noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the Dhamma.'

Not long after they have thus gone forth, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. They say thus: 'We were very nearly lost, we very nearly perished, for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though we were not really recluses; we claimed that we were brahmins though we were not really brahmins; we claimed that we were arahants though we were not really arahants.

The brahmin Brahmayu heard: liThe recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus.

When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body. He saw, more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body, except two; he was doubt-ful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: \"This brahmin student Uttara sees, more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man ii 136 Brahmayu 745 on me, except two; he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.\" 7.

Then the brahmin student Uttara thought: \"The recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.

He has hair growing in the space between his eyebrows, which is white with the sheen of soft cotton ... His head is shaped like a turban - this is a mark of a Great Man in Master Gotama.857 Master Gotama is endowed with these thirty-two marks of a Great Man. 10. \"When he walks, he steps out with the right foot first. He does not extend his foot too far or put it down too near. He walks neither too quickly nor too slowly. He walks without his knees knocking together. He walks without his ankles knocking together. He walks without raising or lowering his thighs, or bringing them together or keeping them apart. When he walks, only the lower part of his body oscillates, and he does not wa~k with bodily effort. When he turns to look, he does so with his whole body. He does not look straight up; he does not look ii 139 Brahmayu 747 straight down. He does not walk looking about. He looks a plough-yoke's length before him; beyond that he has unhin-dered knowledge and vision. 11. \"When he goes indoors, he does not raise or lower his body, or bend it forward or back. [138] He turns round neither too far from the seat nor too near it. He does not lean on the seat with his hand. He does not throw his body onto the seat. 12. \"When seated indoors, he does not fidget with his hands. He does not fidget with his feet. He does not sit with his knees crossed. He does not sit with his ankles crossed. He does not sit with his hand holding his chin. When seated indoors he is not afraid, he does not shiver and tremble, he is not nervous. Being unafraid, not shivering or trembling or nervous, his hair does not stand up and he is intent on seclusion. 13. \"When he receives the water for the bowl, he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards. He receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl. He washes the bowl without making a splashing noise. He washes the bowl without turning it round. He does not put the bowl on the floor to wash his hands: when his hands are washed, the bowl is washed; and when the bowl is washed, his hands are washed. He pours the water for the bowl neither too far nor too near and he does not pour it about. 14. \"When he receives rice, he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards. He receives neither too little rice. nor too much rice. He adds sauces in the right proportion; he does not exceed the right amount of sauce in the mouthful. He turns the mouthful over two or three times in his mouth and then swallows it, and no rice kernel enters his body unchewed, and no rice kernel remains in his mouth; then he takes another mouthful. He takes his food experiencing the taste, though not experiencing greed for the taste. The food he takes has eight fac-tors: it is neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of his body, for the ending of dis-comfort, and for assisting the holy life; [139] he considers: 'Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.'858 15. \"When he has eaten and receives water for the bowl, he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"748 Brahmilyu Sutta: Sutta 91 ii 140 He receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl.

When he has done so, he rises from his seat and departs. 18. \"He walks neither too fast nor too slow, and he does not go as one who wants to get away. 19. \"His robe is worn neither too high nor too low on his body, nor too tight against his bpdy, nor too loose.on his body, nor does the wind blow his robe away from his body. Dust and dirt do not soil his body. 20. \"When he has gone to the monastery, he sits down on a seat made ready. Having sat down, he washes his feet, though he does not concern himself with grooming-his feet. Having washed his feet, he seats himself cross-legged, sets his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He does not occupy his mind with self-affliction, or the affliction of others, or the affliction of both; he sits with his mind set on his own wel-fare, on the welfare of others, and on the welfare of both, even on the welfare of the whole world. [140] 21. \"When he has gone to the monastery, he teaches the Dhamma to an audience. He neither flatters nor berates that audience; he instructs, urges, rouses, and encourages it with talk purely on the Dhamma. The speech that issues from his mouth has eight qualities: it is distinct, intelligible, melodious, audible, ringing, euphonious, deep, and sonorous. But while his voice is intelligible as far as the audience extends, his speech does not issue out beyond the audience. When the people have been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by him, they rise ii 141 Brahmtlyu 749 from their seats and depart looking only at him and concerned with nothing else. 22. \"We have seen Master Gotama walking, sir, we have seen him standing, we have seen him entering indoors, we have seen him indoors seated in silence after eating, we have seen him giv-ing the blessing after eating, we have seen him going to the monastery in silence, we have seen him in the monastery teach-ing the Dhamma to an audience. Such is the Master Gotama' such he is, and more than that.\"860 ' 23. When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times: \"Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama, perhaps we might have some conversation with him.\" 24. Then, in the course of his wandering, the Blessed One eventually arrived at Mithila. There the Blessed One lived in Makhadeva's Mango Grove. The brahmin householders of Mithila heard: [141] \"The recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wander-ing in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, and he has now come to Mithila and is living in Makhadeva's Mango Grove. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect ... (as in §3 above) ... Now it is good to see such arahants.\" 25. Then the brahmin householders of Mithila went to the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards him and sat down at one side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one side; ~ome kept silent and sat down at one side. 26.

When he came to the Mango Grove,.he thought: \"It is not proper that I should go to the recluse Gotama without first being announced.\" Then he addressed a certain brahmin student: \"Come, brahmin student, go to the recluse Gotama and ask in my name whether the recluse Gotama is free from illness and affliction, and is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: 'Master Gotama, the brahmin Brahmayu asks whether Master Gotama is free from illness ... abiding in comfort,' and say this: 'The brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama, is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage; he is in his hundred and twentieth year. He is a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histo-ries as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. Of all the brahmin householders who live in Mithila, the brah-min Brahmayu is pronounced the foremost of them in wealth, in knowledge of the hyrrms, and in age and fame. [142] He wants to see Master Gotama.'\" \"Yes, sir,\" the brahmin student replied. He went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side and delivered his message. [The Blessed One said:] \"Now is the time for the brahmin Brahmayu to do as he thinks fit.\" 27. Then the brahmin student went to the brahmin Brahmayu and said: \"Permission has been granted by the recluse Gotama. Now is the time, sir, to do as you think fit.\" So the brahmin Brahmayu went to the Blessed One. The assembly saw him coming in the distance, and they at once made way for him as for one who was well known and famous. Then the brahmin Brahmayu said to the assembly: \"Enough, sirs, let each sit down in his own seat. I shall sit here next to the recluse Gotama.\" 28. Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was fin-ished, he sat down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body. [143] He saW, more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed ii 143 Brahmayu 751 One's body, except two; he was doubtful about two of the marks, and he could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue. 29. Then the brahmin Brahmayu addressed the Blessed One in stanzas: \"The two-and-thirty marks I learned That are the signs of a Great Man-I still do not see two of these Upon your body, Gotama. Is what should be concealed by cloth Hid in a sheath, greatest of men? Though called by a word of feminine gender,861 Perhaps your tongue is a manly one? Perhaps your tongue is large as well, According to what we have been taught? Please put it out a little bit And so, 0 Seer, cure our doubt For welfare in this very life And happiness in lives to come.

Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched both ear holes a~d both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue. 31. ~en the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply to the brahmm Brahmayu:"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"752 Brahmiiyu Sutta: Sutta 91 \"The two-and-thirty marks you learned That are the signs of a Great Man -All on my body can be found: So, brahmin, doubt no more on that.

Then the brahmin Brahmayu thought: \"Permission has been granted me by the recluse Gotama. Which should I ask him about: good in this life or good in the lives to come?\" Then he thought: \"I am skilled in the good of this life, and others too ask me about good in this life. Why shouldn't I ask him only about good in the lives to come?\" Then he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas: \"How does one become a brahmin? And how does one attain to knowledge?~ How has one the triple knowledge? And how does one become a holy scholar? How does one become an arahant? And how does one attain completeness? How is one a silent sage? And how can one be called a Buddha?\"864 33. Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply: \"Who knows about his former lives, Sees heaven and states of deprivation, And has arrived at birth's destruction-A sage who knows by direct knowledge, Who knows his mind is purified, Entirely freed from every lust, ii 145 Who has abandoned birth and death, Who is complete in the holy life, Who has transcended everything -One such as this is called a Buddha.\"865 Brahmiiyu 753 34. When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and he covered the Blessed One's feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands, pronouncing his name: \"1 am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama; I am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama.\" 35. Those in the assembly wondered and marvelled, and they said: \"It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous, what great power and great might the recluse Gotama has, for the well-known and famous brahmin Brahmayu to make such a display of humility!\" Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Brahmayu: [145] \"Enough, brahmin, arise; sit down in your own seat since your mind has confidence in me.\" The brahmin Brahmayu then rose and sat down in his own seat. 36. The Blessed One then gave him progressive instruction,866 that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of re-nunciation. When he knew that the brahmin Brahmayu's mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessa-tion, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so too, while the brahmin Brahmayu sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: \"All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation.\" Then' the brahmin Brahmayu saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intre-pidity, and became independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation. 37. Then he said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!

Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed. 38. Then, when the night had ended, the brahmin Brahmayu had good food of various kinds prepared in his residence, and he had the time announced to the Blessed One: \"It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.\" [146] Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the brahmin Brahmayu's residence and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, for a week, with his own hands, the brahmin Brahmayu served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food. 39. At the end of that week, the Blessed One set out to wander in the country of the Videhans. Soon after he had gone, the brah-min Brahmayu died. Then a number of bhikkhus w~nt to t~e Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and said: \"Venerable sir, the brah.ril.in Brahmayu has died. What is his destin~tion? What is his future course?\" \"Bhikkhus, the brahmin Brahmayu was wise, he entered into the way of the Dhamma, and he did not trouble me in the inter-pretation of the Dhamma.

The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 92 Sela Sutta To Sela 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.867 On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, [102] with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a town of the Anguttarapans named ApaI).a. 2. The matted-hair ascetic Ker:tiya heard: \"The recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with twelve hundred and fifty [103] bhikkhus, and he has come to ApaI).a. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect ... (as Sutta 91, §3) ... Now it is good to see such arahants.\" 3. Then the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and when this courte-ous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged him with a talk on the Dhamma. Then, having been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya said to the Blessed One: \"Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.\" When this was said, the Blessed One told him: \"The Sangha of bhikkhus is large, KeI).iya, [104] consisting of twelve hun-dred and fifty bhikkhus, and you place full confidence in the brahmins.\" A second time the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya said to the Blessed One: \"Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Master Gotama, consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and although I place full confidence in the brahmins, still let Master Gotama, together with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to 755"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"756 Sela Sutta: Sutta 92 Sn 105 accept tomorrow's meaifrom me.\" A second time the Blessed One told him: \"The Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Ker;riya ... \" A third time the matted-hair ascetic KeDiya said to the Blessed One: \"Although the Sangha is large, Master Gotama ... still let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.\" The Blessed One consented in silence. 4. Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, the matted-hair ascetic KeDiya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where he addressed his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives thus: \"Hear me, sirs, my friends and companions, my kinsmen and relatives. The recluse Gota~a has been invited by me for tomorrow's meal together wIth the Sangha of bhikkhus. Make the necessary purchases and prepa-rations for me.\" \"Yes, sir,\" they replied, and some dug out ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, son:e set ~ut wa~er j~gs, some prepared seats, while the matted-haIr ascetic KeDIya hIm-self set up a pavilion. 5. Now on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at ApaDa. [105] He was a master of the Three Vedas with t~eir vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the hIsto-ries as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man, and was teaching the recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students. • 6. At the time the matted-hair ascetic KeDiya had placed full confidence in the brahmin Sela. Then the brahmin Sela, while walking and wandering for exercise attended by his .three ~u~­dred brahmin students, came to the matted-hair ascetIc KeDIya s hermitage. There he saw some men digging out ovens, some chopping wood, some washing dishes, some s~tting ~ut wa.ter jugs, some preparing seats, while the matted-haIr ascetIc KeDlya himself was setting up a pavilion. . 7. When he saw this, :\\1e asked the matted-hair ascetic KeDlya: \"What, is Master Ker:riya to hold a marriage or a giving in ffi.ar-riage? Or is there some great sacrifice? Or has Kin~ Semya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retmue for tomorrow's meal?\" 8. \"I will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage, Master Sela, nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been Sn 107 To Sela 757 invited with a large retinue for tomorrow's meal, but I am plan-ning a great sacrifice.

[106] Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sub-lime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened [buddha], blessed.' He has been invited by me for tomorrow's meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.\" 9. \"Did you say 'Buddha,' Ker;riya?\" \"I said 'Buddha,' Sela.\" \"Did you say 'Buddha,' KeDiya?\" \"I said 'Buddha,' Sela.\" 10. Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela: \"Even this word 'Buddha' is hard to come across in this world. Now the thirty-two marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns, and the Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other. If he lives the home life he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters, all-victorious, who has stabilised his country and possesses the seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure, the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman-treasure, the steward-treasure, and the counsellor-treasure as the seventh. His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and heroic and crush the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the ocean he rules without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the Dhamma. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he becomes an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside the veil in the world.\" 11. [He said]: \"My good KeDiya, where is Master Gotama, the Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened One, now living?\" When this was said, the matted-hair ascetic Ker;riya extended his right arm and said: [107] \"There, where that green line of the grove is, Master Sela.\" 12.

Then the brahmin Sela went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and ami-able talk was finished, he sat down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body. He saw, more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body, except two; he was doubtful and uncer-tain about two of the marks, and he could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.

[108] Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue; and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue. 15. Then the brahmin Sela thought: \"The recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man; they are complete, not incomplete. But I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not. However, I have heard from elder aged brah-mins who speak according to the lineage of teachers that those who are the Accomplished Ones, Fully Enlightened Ones, reveal themselves as such when their praise is spoken. Suppose I extol the recluse Gotama to his face with fitting stanzas.\" Then he extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting stanzas: 16.

Then, when the night had ended, the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya had good food of various kinds prepared in his own her-mitage [111] and had the time announced to the Blessed One: \"It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.\" Then, it being morn-ing, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, the matted-hair ascetic KeI).iya took a low seat and sat down on one side. Thereupon the Blessed One gave him his blessing with these stanzas: 26. \"Burnt offerings are the glory of fires, SavitrI the glory of Vedic hymns, Glory of human beings, a king, Glory of flowing rivers, the sea;"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"762 Sela Sutta: Sutta 92 The moon is the glory of the stars, The sun is the glory of all that shine; Merit is the glory of all who aspire; The Sangha, glory of those who give.\" Sn 112 When the Blessed One had given his blessing with these stan-zas, he rose from his seat and departed. 27.

Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to the Blessed One. Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, extending his hands in reverential greeting towards the Blessed One, he addressed him with these stanzas: \"Eight days have passed, All-Seeing One, Since we went to you for refuge. In these seven nights, 0 Blessed One, We have been tamed in your teaching. You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher, You are the Sage, the conqueror of Mara. Having cut off all evil tendencies, You have crossed and guide humanity across. You have surmounted all attachments, You have removed all the taints. You are a lion free from clinging, You have abandoned fear and dread. Here these three hundred bhikkhus stand With hands held out in adoration. o Hero, extend your feet, And let these great beings worship the Teacher.\" 93 Assalayana Sutta To Assalayana [147] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapir:u;l.ika's Park. 2. Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were staying at SavatthI for some business or other. Then those brahmins thought: \"This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes.869 Who is there able to dis-pute with him about this assertion?\" 3. Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalayana was staying at SavatthI. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. Then the brahmins thought: \"There is this young brahmin student named Assa-layana staying at Savatthi. Young ... fully versed in natural philos-ophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He will be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion.\" 4. So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalayana and said to him: \"Master Assalayana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assa-layana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. \" When this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: \"Sirs, the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion.\" A second time the brahmins said to him: \"Master Assalayana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assalayana come [148] and dispute with the recluse 763"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"764 Assalayana Sutta: Sutta 93 ii 149 Gotama about this assertion.

Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion.\" A third time the brahmins said to him: \"Master Assalayana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. For the training of a wan-derer has been completed by Master Assalayana. Let not the Master Assalayana be defeated without having even fought the battle.\" . When this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: \"Sirs, the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. Still, sirs, at your bidding I will go.\" 5. Then the brahmin student Assalayana went with a large number of brahmins to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One: \"Master Gotama, the brahmins say thus: 'Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any other caste are dark; only l:rahmins are puri-fied not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma, the ~ffspring of Brahma: born of his mouth, born of Brahma, cre-ated by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.'

Knowing this, the Blessed One said to him: 18. \"Once, Assalayana, when seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest, this pernicious view arose in them: 'Brahmins are the highest caste ... [155] ... heirs of Brahma.' Now the seer Devala the Dark heard this.874 Then he arranged his hair and beard, dressed in ochre-coloured garments, put on stout sandals, and taking a staff made of gold, he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers. Then, while walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers, the seer Devala the Dark spoke thus: 'Where have those worthy brahmin ii 157 To Assalayana 769 seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?' Then the seven brahmin seers thought: 'Who is walking up and down in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking thus: \"Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?\" Let us curse him!' Then the seven brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus: 'Be ashes, vile one! Be ashes, vile one!' But the more the seven brahmin seers cursed him, the more comely, beautiful, and handsome the seer Devala the Dark became. Then the seven brahmin seers thought: 'Our asceticism is in vain, our holy life is fruitless; for formerly when we cursed anyone thus: \"Be ashes, vile one! Be ashes, vile one!\" he always became ashes; but the more we curse this one, the more comely, beautiful, and handsome he becomes.' '''Your asceticism is not in vain, sirs, your holy life is not fruit-less. But, sirs, put away your hatred towards me.' [156] \"'We have put away our hatred towards you, sir.

When this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana said to the Blessed One: \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! ... (as Sutta 91, §37) ... From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\" 94 Ghotamukha Sutta To Ghotamukha 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Udena was living at Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove. 2. Now on that occasion the brahmin Ghotamukha had arrived in Benares for some business or other. As he was [158] walking and wandering for exercise, he came to the Khemiya Mango Grove. At the time the venerable Udena was walking up and down in the open. Then the brahmin Ghotamukha went up to the venerable Udena and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, still walking up and down with the venerable Udena, he said this: \"Worthy recluse, there is no wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma: so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma here.\" 3. When this was said, the venerable Udena stepped down from the walk and went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.877 And Ghotamukha too stepped down from the walk and went into the dwelling, where he stood at one side. Then the venerable Udena said to him: \"There are seats, brahmin, sit down if you wish.\" \"We did not sit down because we were waiting for Master Udena [to speak]. For how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without first being invited to do so?\" 4. Then the brahmin Ghotamukha took a low seat, sat down at one side, and said to the venerable Udena: \"Worthy recluse, there is no wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma: so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma here.\" \"Brahmin, if you think any statement of mine is to be agreed with, then agree with it; if you think any statement of mine is to 771"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"772 Ghotamukha Sutta: Sutta 94 ii 160 be argued against, then argue against it; and if you do not understand the meaning of any statement of mine, ask me to clarify it thus: 'How is this, Master Udena?

What is the meaning of this?' In this way let us discuss this matter.\" 5-6. \"Brahmin, there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the world. What four?\" ... (as Sutta 51, §§5-6) [160] ... \"But, Master Udena, the kind of per50n who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others; who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experi-encing bliss, having himself become holy -he does not torment and torture either himself or others, both of whom desire plea-sure and recoil from pain. That is why this kind of person satis-fies my mind.\" 7. \"Brahmin, there are two kinds of assembly. What two? Here a certain assembly lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children, men and women slav~s, fields and land, gold and silver. But h~re a certain assembly does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned wives and children, men and women slaves, fields and land, gold and silver, has gone forth from the home life into homelessness.

In which of the two kinds of assembly do you usually see this person, brahmin -in the assembly that lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children, men and women slaves, fields and land, gold and silver; or in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned wives and children ... has gone forth from the home life into homelessness?\" ii 162 To Ghotamukha 773 [161] \"I usually see this kind of person, Master Udena, in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned wives and children ... has gone forth from the home life into homelessness.\" 8. \"But only just now, brahmin, we understood you to say: 'Worthy recluse, there is no wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma: so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma here.'\" \"Certainly, Master Udena, it was in order to learn that I spoke those words. There is a wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma; so it seems to me here, and may Master Udena remember me [to have spoken] thus. It would be good if, out of compassion, Master Udena would expound to me in detail those four kinds of persons he mentioned in brief.\" 9. \"Then, brahmin, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.\" -\"Yes, sir,\" the brahmin Gho!amukha replied. The venera-ble Udena said this: 10-30. \"Brahmin, what kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself? Here a certain person goes naked .. . (as Sutta 51, §§8-28) [162] ... and abides experienc-ing bliss, having himself become holy.\" 31. When this was said, the brahmin Ghotamukha said to the venerable Udena: \"Magnificent, Master Udena! Magnificent, Master Udena! Master Udena has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Udena for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\" 32. \"Do not go to me for refuge, brahmin. Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.\" \"Where is he living now, that Master Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened, Master Udena?\" \"That Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, has attained final Nibbana, brahmin.\" \"If we heard that Master Gotama was within ten leagues, we would go ten leagues in order to see that Master Gotama,"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"774 Ghotamukha Sutta: Sutta 94 ii 163 accomplished and fully enlightened.

But since that Master Gotama has attained to final Nibbana, we go to that Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. 33. \"Now, Master Udena, the king of Anga gives me a daily donation.

And that is now known as the GhotamukhI. 95 Cankr Sutta WithCankI [164] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.880 On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin vil-lage named Opasada. There the Blessed One stayed in the Gods' Grove,881 the Sala-tree Grove to the north of Opasada. 2. Now on that occasion the brahmin CankI was ruling over Opasada, a crown property abounding in living beings, rich in grasslands, woodlands, waterways, and grain, a royal endow-ment, a sacred grant given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala. 3. The brahmin householders of Opasada heard: \"The recluse Gotama ... (as Sutta 91, §3) ... Now it is good see such arahants.\" 4. Then the brahmin householders of Opasada set forth from Opasada in groups and bands and headed northwards to the Gods' Grove, the Sala-tree Grove. 5. Now on that occasion the brahmin CankI had retired to the upper storey of his palace for his midday rest. Then he saw the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and bands and heading northwards to the Gods' Grove, the Sala-tree Grove. When he saw them, he asked his minister: \"Good minister, why are the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and bands and heading northwards to the Gods' Grove, the Sal a-tree Grove?\" 6. \"Sir, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, who has been wandering in the Kosalan country ...

Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a teacher of the teachers of many. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is free from sensual lust and without personal vanity. Sirs, the recluse Gotama holds the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action, the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deeds; he does not seek any harm for the line of brahmins. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from an aristocratic family, from one of the original noble families. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from a rich family, from a family of great wealth and great possessions. Sirs, people come from remote kingdoms and remote districts to question the recluse Gotama. Sirs, many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama.

When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. 11. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some amiable talk with some very senior brahmins. At the time, sitting in the assembly, was a brahmin student named Kapathika. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of the Three Wedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar; he was fully versed in natural philoso-phy and in the marks of a Great Man. While the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One, he often broke in and interrupted their talk. Then the Blessed One rebuked the brahmin student Kapathika thus: \"Let not the venerable Bharadvaja break in and interrupt the talk of the very senior brahmins while they are conversing. Let the venerable Bharadvaja wait until the talk is finished.\" When this was said, the brahmin CankI said to the Blessed One: \"Let not Master Gotama rebuke the brahmin student Kapathlka. The brahmin student Kapathika is a clansman, he is very learned, he has a good delivery, he is wise; he is capable of taking part in this discussion with Master Gotama.\" ii 170 With Cankf 779 12. Then the Blessed One thought: \"Surely, [169] since the brahmins honour him thus, the brahmin student Kapathika must be accomplished in the scriptures of the Three Vedas.\" Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought: \"When the recluse Gotama catches my eye, I shall ask him a question.\" Then, knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student Kapathika's mind, the Blessed One turned his eye towards him. Then the brahmin student Kapathika thought: \"The recluse Gotama has turned towards me. Suppose I ask him a question.\" Then he said to the Blessed One: \"Master Gotama, in regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission and in the scriptural collections, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: 'Only this is true, any-thing else is wrong.' What does Master Gotama say about this?\" 13. \"How then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus: 'I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?\" -\"No, Master Gotama.\" \"How then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a 'single teacher or a single teacher's teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thus: 'I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?\" -\"No, Master Gotama.\" \"How then, Bharadvaja, the ancient brahmin seers, the cre-ators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns that were formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled, the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken and reciting what was recited -that is, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhara-dvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu883 -did even these ancient brahmin seers say thus: 'We know this, we see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?\" -[170] \"No, Master Gotama.\" \"So, Bharadvaja, it seems that among the brahmins there 'is not even a single brahmin who says thus: 'I know this, I see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.'

What ate the five? The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt.

Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states.

And it is possible that the other brah-min, not that brahmin, gets the best seat, the best water, the best alms food in the refectory. Thinking about this, [205] the first brahmin might become angry and displeased.

But one gone forth has a small amount of activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings: he con-stantly and invariably speaks the truth, practises asceticism, observes celibacy, engages in study, and engages in generosity. Thus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the per-formance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, I often see among those gone forth, seldom among householders.\" 21. \"Those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, [206] I call equipment of the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without hostility and without ill will.

At the time there was a brahmin student named Sangarava staying at Cax:t<;lalakappa. He was a master of the Three Vedas, with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as the fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man.

Then his friends and com-panions, kinsmen and relatives, brought a surgeon. The surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife, probe for the arrow with a probe, pull out the arrow, and apply a med-icinal cauteriser to the opening of the wound, and at each step the man would feel painful, racking, piercing feelings. Then on a later occasion, when the wound was healed artd covered with skin, the man would be well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. He might think: \"Formerly I was pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with poison, and ii 218 At Devadaha 829 because of this I felt painful, racking, piercing feelings. Then my friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives, brought a sur-geon. The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound with a knife, probed for the arrow with a probe, pulled out the arrow, and applied a medicinal cauteriser to the opening of the wound, and at each step I felt painful, racking, piercing feel-ings. [217] But now that the wound is healed and covered with skin, I am well and happy, independent, my own master, able to go where I like.\" 8. '''So too, friend NigaDthas, if you knew that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist ... or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now; that being so, it would be fitting for the venerable NigaDthas to declare: \"Whatever this person feels ... all suffering will be exhausted.\" 9. '''But since, friend NigaDthas, you do not know that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist ... or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now, it is not fitting for the venerable NigaDthas to declare: \"Whatever this person feels ... all suffering will be exhausted.'\" 10. \"When this was said, the NigaDthas told me: [218] 'Friend, the NigaDtha Nataputta is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus: \"Whether I am walking or standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.\" He says thus: \"NigaDthas, you have done evil actions in the past; exhaust them with the performance of piercing austerities. And when you are here and now restrained in body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil actions for the future. So by annihi~ lating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no con-sequence in the future ... all suffering will be exhausted.\" We approve of and accept this, and so we are satisfied: 11. \"When this was said, I told the NigaDthas:924 'There are five things, friend NigaDthas, that may turn out in two different ways here and now.

'~So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffenng and does not overwhelm himself with suffering ... (as in §23 above) [225] ... thus that suffering is exhausted in him. Thus, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful. 27. \"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu considers thus: 'While I live according to my pleasure, unwholesome states increase in me ~d ,:holesome states diminish; but when I exert myself in what IS parnful, unwholesome states diminish in me and wholesome states increase. What if I exert myself in what is painful?' He exerts himself in what is painful. When he does so, unwhole-some states diminish in him and wholesome states increase.934 ~t a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful. Why 15 that? The purpose for which that bhikkhu exerted himself in what is painful has been achieved; that is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful. 28: \"Suppose, bhikkhus, an arrowsmith were warming and heating an arrow shaft between two flames, making it straight and workable.

Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions.

On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing in the Sakyan country at Samagama. 2. Now on that occasion the NigaDtha Nataputta had just died at Pava.976 On his death the NigaDthas divided, split into two; and they had taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers: \"You do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline. I understand this Dhamma and Discipline. How could you understand this Dhamma and Discipline? Your way is wrong. My way is right. I am consistent. You are inconsistent. What should have been said first [244] you said last. What should have been said last you said first. What you had so carefully thought up has been turned inside out. Your assertion has been shown up. You are refuted. Go and learn better, or disentangle yourself if you can!\" It seemed as if there were nothing but slaughter among the NigaDtha Nataputta's pupils. And his white-clothed lay disci-ples were disgusted, dismayed, and disappointed with the Nig3l).tha Nataputta's pupils, as they were with his badly pro-claimed and badly expounded Dhamma and Discipline, which was unemancipating, unconducive to peace, expounded by one not fully enlightened, and was now with its shrine broken, reft without a refuge.977 3. Then the novice Cunda,978 who had spent the Rains at Pava, went to the venerable Ananda, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him what was taking place.

But should a dispute arise in the Sangha about the path or the way,980 such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm,and suffer-ing of gods and humans. 6. \"There are, Ananda, these six roots of disputes.981 What six? Here, Ananda, a bhikkhu is angry and revengeful. Such a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and he does not fulfil the training. A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, [246] and who does not fulfil the train-ing, creates a dispute in the Sangha, which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. Now if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should strive to abandon ii 247 At Sllmagama 855 that same evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the future. Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute; thus there is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute in the futUre. -7-11. \"Again, a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering ... envious and avaricious ... deceitful and fraudulent ... has evil wishes and wrong view ... adheres to his own views, holds on to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty. Such a bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and he does not fulfil the training. A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and who does not fulfil the training, creates a dispute in the Sangha, which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. Now if you see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should strive to abandon that same evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should practise in such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the future. [247] Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute; thus there is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute in the future. These are the six roots of dispute. 12. /I Ananda, there are these four kinds of litigation. What four? Litigation because of a dispute, litigation because of an accusation, litigation because of an offence, and litigation con-cerning proceedings. These are the four kinds of litigation.982 13. \"Anand a, there are these seven kinds of settlement of liti-gation.983 For the settlement and pacification of litigations when-ever they arise: removal of litigation by confrontation may be provided, removal of litigation on account of memory may be provided, removal of litigation on account of past insanity may be provided, the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence, the opinion of the majority, the pronouncement of bad character against someone, and covering over with grass. 14. /I And how is there removal of litigation by confronta-tion?984 Here bhikkhus are disputing: 'It is Dhamma,' or 'It is not Dhamma,' or 'It is Discipline,' or 'It is not Discipline.'

And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation by confrontation. 15. \"And how is there the opinion of a majority? If those bhikkhus cannot settle that litigation in that dwelling place, they should go to a dwelling place where there is a greater number of bhikkhus. There they should all meet together in concord.

He says: 'I do not, friends, remember hav-ing committed such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat.' [2481 In his case removal of litiga-tion on account of memory should be pronounced. Such is the removal of litigation oQ, account of memory. And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litiga-tion on account of memory. 17. \"And how is there removal of litigation on account of past insanity?988 Here one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat: 'Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He says: ' I do not, friends, remember having com-mitted such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat.' Despite the denial, the former presses the latter further: 'Surely the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He says: 'I had gone mad, friend, I was out of my mind, and when I was mad I ii 249 At Samagama 857 said and did many things improper for a recluse. I do not remember, I was mad when I did that.' In his case removal of lit-igation on account of past insaruty should be pronounced. Such is the removal of litigation on account of past insanity. And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation on account of past insanity. . 18. \"And how is there the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence? Here a bhikkhu, whether reproved or unreproved, remembers an offence, reveals it, and discloses it. He should go to a senior bhikkhu, and after arranging his robe on one shoul-der, he should pay homage at his feet. Then, sitting on his heels, he should raise his hands palms together and say: 'Venerable sir, I have committed such and such an offence; I confess it. ' The other says: 'Do you s~e?' - 'Yes, I see.' -'Will you practise restraint in the future?' -'I will practise restraint in the future.' Such is the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence.989 And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence. [249] 19. \"And how is there the pronouncement of bad character against someone?990 Here one bhikkhu reproves another for such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat: 'Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?'

Such is the pronouncement of bad character against someone, And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the pronouncement of bad character against someone. [250] 20. \"And how is there covering over with grass?991 Here when bhikkhus have taken to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes, they may have said and done many things improper for a recluse. Those bhikkhus should all meet together in con-cord. When they have met together, a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the one part should rise from his seat, and after arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should raise his hands, palms together, and call for an enactment of the Sangha thus: 'Let the venerable Sangha hear me. When we took to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes, we said and did many things improper for a recluse. If it is approved by the Sangha, then for thfi good of these venerable ones and for my own good, in the midst of the Sangha I shall confess, by the method of covering over with grass, any offences of these vener-able ones and any offences of my own, except for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the laity.'992 \"Then a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side together on the other part should rise from his seat, and after arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should raise his hands, palms together, and call for an enactment of the Sangha thus: 'Let the venerable Sangha hear me.

Such is the covering over with grass. And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by the covering over with grass. 21. \"Ananda, there are these six memorable qualities that cre-ate love and respect, and conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.993 What are the six? \"Here a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life.

That will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\" That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 105 Sunakkhatta Sutta To Sunakkhatta [252] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at VesalI in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. 2. Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus: \"We understand: Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" 3. Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis,995 heard: \"A number of bhikkhus, it seems, have declared final knowledge in the pres-ence of the Blessed One thus: 'We understand: Birth is destroyed ... there is no more coming to any state of being.'\" Then Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One: 4. \"I have heard, venerable sir, that a number of bhikkhus have declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One. Did they do so rightly or are there some bhikkhus here who declare final knowledge because they overestimate themselves?\" 5. \"When those bhikkhus, Sunakkhatta, declared final knowl-edge in my presence, there were some bhikkhus who declared final knowledge rightly and there were some who declared final knowledge because they overestimated themselves.996 Therein, when bhikkhus declare final knowledge rightly, their declara-tion is true. But when bhikkhus declare final knowledge because they overestimate themselves, the Tathagata thinks: 'Let me teach them the Dhamma.'997 Thus it is in this case, Sunakkhatta, that the Tathagata thinks: 'Let me teach them the Dhamma.' But some misguided men here formulate a question, come to the Tathagata, and ask it. In that case, Sunakkhatta, [253] though the 861"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"862 Sunakkhatta Sutta: Sutta 105 ii 254 Tathagata has thought: 'Let me teach them the Dhamma,' he changes his mind.\"998 6. \"This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhuswill remember it.\" \"Then listen, Sunakkhatta, and attend closely to what I shall say.\" \"Yes, venerable sir,\" Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: 7. \"there are, Sunakkhatta, these five cords of sensual plea-sure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ... Odours cognizable by the nose ... Flavours cognizable by the tongue ... Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure. 8. \"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent on worldly material thingS.999 When a person is intent on worldly material things, only talk concerning that interests him, and his thinking and pondering are in line with that, and he associates with that kind of person, and he finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about the imperturbable is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear or: exert his mind to understand it. He doe:; not associate with that kind of person, and he does not find satisfaction through him. 9. \"Suppose, Sunakkhatta, a man had left his own village or town a long time ago, and he were to see another man who had only recently left that village or town. He would ask that man whether the people of that village or town were safe, prosper-ous, and healthy, and that man would tell him whether the peo-ple of that village or town were safe, prosperous, [254] and healthy. What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Would that first man listen to him, give him ear, and exert his mind to understand?\"-\"Yes, venerable sir.\" -\"So too, Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some person here may be intent on worldly material thingS. When a person is intent on worldly material things ... and he does not find satisfaction through him. He should be under-stood as a person who is intent on worldly material things. ii 255 To Sunakkhatta 863 10.

The Blessed One, indeed, has explained to us the crossing of the flood in dependence upon one support or another.1020 But, venerable sir, what is noble liberation?\"1021 \"Here, Ananda, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Sensual plea-sures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sen-sual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives . to come, material forms here and now and material forms in lives to come, perceptions of forms here and now and percep-tions of forms in lives to come, perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the base of nothingness, and perceptions of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception - this is personal-ity as far as personality extends.1022 This is the Deathless, name-ly, the liberation of the mind through not clinging.1l023 14. \"Thus, Ananda, I have taught the way directed to the imperturbable, I have taught the way directed to the base of nothingness, I have taught the way directed to the base of nei-ther-perception-nor-non-perception, I have taught the crossing of the flood in dependence upon one support or another, I haye taught noble liberation. 15. \"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, [266] that I have done for you, Ananda.

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother. Then the brahmin Ga1).aka Moggallana went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this cour-teous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One: 2. \"Master Gotama, in this Palace of Migara's Mother there can be seen gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress, that is, down to the last step of the staircase.1024 Among these brahmins too, there can be seen gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress, that is, in study. Among archers too, there can be seen gradual training ... that is, in archery. And also among accountants1025 like us, who earn our living by accountancy, there can be seen gradual training ... that is, in computation. For when we get an apprentice first we make him count: one one, tw'O twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens; and we make him count a hundred too. Now is it also possible, Master Gotama, to describe gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline?\" [2] 3. \"It is possible, brahmin, to describe gradual training, grad-ual practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline. Just as, brahmin, when a clever horse-trainer obtains a fine thoroughbred colt, he first makes him get used to wearing the bit, and afterwards trains him further,1026 so when the Tathagata obtains a person to be tamed he first disciplines him thus: 'Come, bhikkhu, be virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha, be perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the training precepts.' 874 iii 3 To GalJaka Moggalliina 875 4. \"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is virtuous ... and seeing fear in the slightest fault, trains by undertaking the training precepts, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the eye faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear. .. On smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the body ... On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.' 5. \"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense faculties, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, you should take food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: \"Thus I shall termi-nate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.'\" 6. \"When, [3] brahmin, the bhikkhu is moderate in eating, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be devoted to wakefulness. During the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night you should lie down on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your mind the time for rising. After rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states.' 7. \"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full aware-ness when going forward and returning; act in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; act in full awareness"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"876 Gar;akamoggallana Sutta: Sutta 107 iii 4 when flexing and extending your 11mbs; act in full awareness when wearing your robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl; act in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; act in full awareness when defecating and uri-nating; act in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent: 8. \"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu possesses mindfulness and full awareness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.' 9. \"He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest. .. a heap of straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed.about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt. [4] 10. \"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfec-tions of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, .he enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompamed by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and plea.sure born of seclusion. With the stilling of applied and sustamed thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentr~­tion. With the fading away as well of rapture, he abides In equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant iii 5 To GarJaka Moggallana 877 abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' With the abandon-ing of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. 11. \"This is my instruction, brahmin, to those bhikkhus who are in the higher training, whose minds have not yet attained the goal, who abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondage. But these things conduce both to a pleasant abiding here and now and to mindfulness and full awareness for those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the bur-den, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge.\"1027 12. When this was said, the brahmin Gal).aka Moggallana asked the Blessed One: \"When Master Gotama's disciples are thus advised and instructed by him, do they all attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, or do some not attain it?\" \"When, brahmin, they are thus advised and instructed by me, some of my disciples attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain it.\" . 13. \"Master Gotama, since Nibbana exists and the path lead-mg to Nibbana exists and Master Gotama is present as the guide, what is the cause and reason why, when Master Gotama's disciples are thus advised and instructed by him, some of them attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain it?\" 14. \"As to that, brahmin, I will ask you a question in return. Answer it as you choose. [5] What do you think, brahmin? Are you familiar with the road leading to Rajagaha?\" \"Yes, Master Gotama, I am familiar with the road leading \"to Rajagaha.\" \"What do you think, brahmin? Suppose a man came who wanted to go to Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: 'Venerable sir, I want to go to Rajagaha. Show me the road to Raja?aha.' Then you. told him: 'Now,good man, this road goes to RaJagaha. Follow It for awhile and you will see a certain vil-lage, go a little further and you will see a certain town, go a little further and you will see Rajagaha with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.' Then, having been thus advised and"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"878 Gat;lakamoggallilna Sutta: Sutta 107 iii 6 instructed by you, he would· take a wrong road and would go to the west.

Follow it for a while ... and you will see Rajagaha with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.' Then, having been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive safely in Rajagaha. Now, brahmin, since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to Rajagaha exists and you are pre-sent as the guide, what is the cause and reason why, when those men have been thus advised and instructed by you, one man takes a wrong road and goes to the west and one arrives safely in Rajagaha?\" [6] \"What can I do about that, Master Gotama? I am one who shows the way.\" \"So too, brahmin, Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists and I am present as the guide. Yet when my dis-ciples have been thus advised and instructed by me, some of them attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain it. What can I do about that, brahmin? The Tathagata is one who shows the way.\"l02B . 15. When this was said, the brahmin GaI).aka Moggallana said to the Blessed One:1029 \"There are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, ,hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken, unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted to wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful of training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware, unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers. Master Gotama does not dwell together with these. \"But there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, and loose-spoken; who are guarded in their sense fac-ulties, moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluseship, greatly respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, iii 7 To Gat;laka Moggallilna 879 energetic, resolute, established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified minds, possessing wisdom, not driv-ellers. Master Gotama dwells together with these. 16 \"Just as black orris root is reckoned as the best of root per-fumes and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of wood perfumes and jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower per-fumes, [7] so too, Master Gotama's advice is supreme among the teachings of today.1030 17. \"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been over-turned, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\""},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"108 Gopakamoggallana Sutta With Gopaka Moggallana 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Ananda was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, not long after the Blessed One had attained to final Nibbana.1031 2. Now on that occasion King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha, being suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Raja-gaha fortified.1032 3. Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ananda dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. Then the venerable Ananda thought: \"It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha. Suppose I went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his workplace.\" 4. So the venerable Ananda went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his workplace. The brahmin Gopaka Moggallana saw the venerable Ananda coming in the 9.istance and said to him: \"Let Master An<\\Ilda come! Welcome to Master Ananda! It is long since Master Ananda found an opportunity to come here. Let Master Ananda be seated; this seat is ready.\" The venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made ready.

Right livelihood, I say, is twofold: there is right livelihood that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening on the side of attachment; and there is right livelihood that is noble, taintless, supramun-dane, a factor of the path. 31. \"And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening on the side of attachment? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple abandons wrong livelihood and gains his living by right livelihood: this is right livelihood that is affected by taints ... on the side of attachment. 32. \"And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The desisting from wrong livelihood, the abstaining, refraining, abstinence from it in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path: this is right livelihood that is noble ... a factor of the path. 33. \"One makes an effort to abandon wrong livelihood and to enter upon right livelihood: this is one's right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong livelihood, mindfully one enters upon right livelihood: this is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right livelihood, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness. (THE GREAT FORTY) 34. \"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? [76] In one of right view, right intention comes into being;l111 in one of right intention, right speech comes into being; in one of right speech, right action comes into being; in one of right action, right livelihood comes into being; in one of right livelihood, right effort comes into being; in one of iii 78 The Great Forty 939 right effort, right mindfulness comes into being; in one of right mindfulness, right concentration comes into being; in one of right concentration, right knowledge comes into being; in one of right knowledge, right deliverance comes into being. Thus, bhikkhus, the path of the disciple in higher training possesses eight factors, the arahant possesses ten factors.1112 35. \"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? In one of right view, wrong view is abol-ished, and the many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong view as condition are also abolished, and the many wholesome states that originate with right view as condition come to fulfilment by development. \"In one of right intention, wrong intention is abolished, and the many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong intention as condition are also abolished, and the many whole-some states that originate with right intention as condition come to fulfilment by development. \"In one of right speech, wrong speech is abolished .. .In one of right action, wrong action is abolished .. .In one of right liveli-hood, wrong livelihood is abolished [77] .. .In one of right effort, wrong effort is abolished .. .In one of right mindfulness, wrong mindfulness is abolished ...

Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went for his day-time abiding to the dwelling of Ka!akhemaka the Sakyan. Now on that occasion there were many resting places prepared in Ka!akhemaka the Sakyan's dwellingY46 When the Blessed One saw this, [110] he thought: \"There are many resting places pre-pared in Ka!akhemaka the Sakyan's dwelling. Do many bhikkhus live there?\" Now on that occasion the venerable Ananda, along with many bhikkhus, was busy making robes at Ghata the Sakyan's dwelling. Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from retreat and went to Ghata the Sakyan's dwelling. There he sat down on a seat made ready and asked the venerable Ananda: \"Ananda, there are many resting places prepared in Ka!akhe-maka the Sakyan's dwelling. Do many bhikkhus live there?\"1147 \"Venerable sir, many resting places have been prepared in KaJakhemaka the Sakyan's dwelling. Many bhikkhus are livittg there. This is our time for making robes, venerable sir.\"ll48 3. \"Anand a, a bhikkhu does not shine by delighting in com-pany, by taking delight in company, by devoting himself to delight in company; by delighting in society, by taking delight in society, by rejoicing in society. Indeed, Ananda, it is not pos-sible that a bhikkhu who delights in company, takes delight in company, and devotes himself to delight in company, who delights in society, takes delight in society, and rejoices in soci-ety, will ever obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the 971"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"972 Mahasunnata Sutta: Sutta 122 iii 111 bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment.n49 But it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone, withdrawn from society, he will obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment. 4. \"Indeed, Ananda, it is not possible that a bhikkhu who delights in company, takes delight in company, and devotes himself to delight in company, who delights in society, takes delight in society, and rejoices in society, will ever enter upon and abide in either the deliverance of mind that is temporary and delectable or in [the deliverance of mind] that is perpetual and unshakeable.1l5O But it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone, withdrawn from society, he will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind that is temporary and delec-table or in [the deliverance of mind] that is perpetual and unshakeable. [111] 5. \"I do not see even a single kind of form, Ananda, from the change and alteration of which there would not arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who lusts for it and takes delight in it. 6. \"However, Ananda, there is this abiding discovered by the Tathagata: to enter and abide in voidness internally by giving no attention to all signs.lIs1 If, while the Tathagata is abiding thus, he is visited by bhikkhus or bhikkhunls, by men or women lay followers, py kings or kings' mmisters, by other sec-tarians or their disciples, then with a mind leaning to seclusion, tending and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, delighting in renunciation, and altogether done with things that are the basis for taints, he invariably talks to them in a way concerned with dismissing them. 7. \"Therefore, Ananda, if a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I enter upon and abide in voidness internally,' he should steady his mind internally, quiet it, bring it to singleness, and concentrate it. And how does he steady his mind internally, quiet it, bring it to singleness, and concentrate it? 8. \"Here, Ananda, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana ... the second jhana ... the third jhana ... the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.

In this way he has full awareness of that. 12. \"When a bhikkhu abides thus, if his mind inclines to talking, he resolves: 'Such talk as is low, vulgar, coarse, igno-ble, unbeneficial, and which does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbana, that is, talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells, the dead, trivialities, the origin of the world, the origin of the sea, whether things are so or are not so: such talk I shall not utter.'

In this way he has full awareness of that. 14. \"Ananda, there are these five cords of sensual pleasureYss What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire iii 115 The Greater Discourse on Voidness 975 and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ... Odours cognizable by the nose ... Flavours cognizable by the tongue ... Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure. 15. \"Herein a bhikkhu should constantly review his own mind thus: 'Does any mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure ever arise in me on any occasion?' If, on reviewing his mind, the bhikkhu understands: 'Mental excite-ment concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure does arise in me on certain occasions,' then he understands: 'Desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure are unabandoned in me.' In this way he has full awareness of that. But if, on review-ing his mind, the bhikkhu understands: 'No mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure arises in me on any occasion,' then he understands: 'Desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure are abandoned in me.' In this way he has full awareness of that. 16. \"Ananda, there are these five aggregates affected by cling-~ng,l1.S6 in regard to which a bhikkhu should abide contemplat-mg nse and fall thus: 'Such is material form, such its arising, such its disappearance; such is feeling, such [115] its arising, ~uch. its disappearance; such is perception, such its arising, such Its ~lS~ppearance; such are formations, such their arising, such theIr dIsappearance; such is consciousness, such its arising, such its disappearance.' 17. \"When he abides contemplating rise and fall in these five aggregates affected by clinging, the conceit 'I am' based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in him. When that is so, that bhikkhu understands: 'The conceit \"I am\" based on these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in me.' In that way he has full awareness of that. 18. \"These states have an entirely wholesome basis; they are noble, supramundane, and inaccessible to the Evil One. 19. \"What do you think, Ananda?

Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.\" 20. \"Ananda, a disciple should not seek the Teacher's com-pany for the sake of discourses, stanzas, and expositions. Why is that? For a long time, Ananda, you have learned the teachings, remembered them, recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated them well by view. But such talk as deals with effacement, as favours the mind's release, and which leads to complete disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbana, that is, talk on wanting little, on contentment, seclusion, aloofness from society, arousing energy, virtue, concentration, wisdom, deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance: for the sake of such talk a disciple should seek the Teacher's company even if he is told to go away. 21. \"Since this is so, Ananda, a teacher's undoing may come about, a pupil's undoing may come about, and the undoing of one who lives the holy life may come about.1l57 22. \"And how does a teacher's undoing come about? Here some teacher resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, [116] a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw. While he lives thus withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him, and as a result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs to craving, and reverts to luxury. This teacher is said to be undone by the teacher's undo-ing. He has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble; ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. This is how the teacher's undoing comes about. 23. \"And how does a pupil's undoing come about? A pupil of that teacher, emulating the teacher's seclusion, resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest...a heap of straw. While he lives thus withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him, and as a result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs to craving, and reverts to luxury. This pupil is said to be undone by the pupil's undoing. He has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to iii 117 The Greater Discourse on Voidness 977 future birth, ageing, and death. This is how the pupil's undoing comes about. 24. \"And how does the undoing of one who lives the holy life come about? Here a Tathagata appears in the world, accom-plished and fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest ... a heap of straw. While he lives thus withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him, yet he does not go astray, or become filled with desire, succumb to craving, and revert to luxury. [117] But a disciple of this teacher, emulating his teacher's seclusion, resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest ... a heap of straw. While he lives thus withdrawn, brah-mins and householders from town and country visit him, and as a result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs to craving, and reverts to luxury. This one who lives the holy life is said to be undone by the undoing of one who lives the holy life. He has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. Thus there comes to be the undoing of one who leads the holy life. And herein, Ananda, the undoing of one who leads the holy life has a more painful result, a more bitter result, than the teacher's undoing or the pupil's undoing, and it even leads to perdition.1l58 25. \"Therefore, Ananda, behave towards me with friendliness, not with hostility. That will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. And how do disciples behave towards the Teacher with hostility, not with friendliness? Here, Ananda, compassionate and seeking their welfare, the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion: 'This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness.' His disciples do not want to hear or give ear or exert their minds to understand; they err and turn aside from the Teacher's Dispensation.

The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 123 Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta Wonderful and Marvellous 1. THUS HAVE 1 HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiJ:l<;lika's Park. 2. Now a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall, where they had met together on returning from their alms-round, after their meal, when this discussion arose among them: \"It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous, how mighty and powerful is the Tathagata! For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past -who attained to final Nibbana, cut [the tangle of] proliferation, broke the cycle, ended the round, and surmounted all suffering -that for those Blessed Ones their birth was thus, their names were thus, their clans were thus, their virtue was thus, their state [of concentration] was thus, their wisdom was thus, their abiding [in attainments] was thus, their deliverance was thus.\"116o When this was said, the venerable Ananda told the bhikkhus: \"Friends, Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathagatas are marvellous and have marvellous qualities.\" [119] However, their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose from meditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on a seat made ready. Then he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you sitting together here now? And what was your discussion that was interrupted?\" \"Here, venerable sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had met together on returning from our almsround, after our meal, when this discussion arose among us: 'It is won-derful, friends, it is marvellous ... their deliverance was thus.'

And even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and the sun, mighty and power-ful as they are, cannot make their light prevail - there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared.1162 And the beings born there perceived each other by that light: \"So other beings, indeed, have appeared here.\" And this ten-thousandfold world system shook and quaked and trem-bled, and there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the iii 121 Wonderful and Marvellous 981 splendour of the gods appeared.'

On one occasion the venerable Bakkula was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.116 7 2.

Then the novice Aciravata tau-ght Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had heard it and mastered it.

Soon after Prince Jayasena had left, the novice Aciravata went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with Prince Jayasena. When he had fin-ished, the Blessed One said to him: 7. \"Aggivessana, how is it possible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying sensual pleasures, being devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures, being con-sumed by the fever of sensual pleasures, bent on the search for sensual pleasures, [130] could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation? That is impossible. 8. \"Suppose,1175 Aggivessana, there were two tamable ele-phants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disci-plined, and two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you think, Aggivessana? Would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed?\" - \"Yes, venerable sir.\" - \"But would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisci-plined, being untamed, acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed, like the two tam-able elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined?\" -\"No, venerable sir.\" - \"So too, Aggivessana, it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures, ... could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation. 9. \"Suppose, Aggivessana, there were a high mountain not far from a village or town, and two friends would leave the village iii 131 The Grade of the Tamed 991 or town and approach the mountain hand in hand. Having reached it, one friend would remain below at the foot of the mountain while the other would climb to the top. Then the friend who remained below at the foot of the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top: 'Well, friend, what do you see, standing on top of the mountain?' And the other replied: 'Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, love-ly groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.' Then the first friend would say: 'It is impossible, [131] friend, it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.' \"Then the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain, take his friend by the arm, and make him climb to the top of the mountain.

And his friend would reply: 'Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.' Then the other would say: 'Friend, just a little earlier we heard you say: \"It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks .. .lovely ponds.\" But just now we heard you say: \"Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks .. .lovely ponds.'\" Then the first friend would reply: 'Because I was obstructed by this high mountain, friend, I did not see what was there to be seen.' 10. \"So too, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is obstructed, hin-dered, blocked, and enveloped by a still greater mass than this -the mass of ignorance. Thus it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures, ... could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation. 11. \"Aggivessana, if these two similes had occurred to you [with reference] to Prince Jayasena, he would have spontaneously acquired confidence in you, and being confident, would have shown his confidence to you.\" \"Venerable sir, how could these two similes have occurred to me [with reference] to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One, since they are spontaneous and have never been heard before?\""},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"992 Dantabhumi Sutta: Sutta 125 iii 133 [132] 12. \"Suppose, Aggivessana, a head-anointed noble king addresses his elephant woodsman thus: 'Good elephant woods-man, mount the king's elephant, enter the elephant wood, and when you see a forest elephant, bind him by the neck to the king's elephant.' Having replied 'Yes, sire,' the elephant woods-man mounts the king's elephant, enters the elephant wood, and when he sees a forest elephant, binds him by the neck to the king's elephant. The king's elephant leads him out into the open. It is in this way that a forest elephant comes out into the open; for the forest elephant clings to the elephant wood. \"Then the elephant woodsman informs the head-anointed noble king: 'Sire, the forest elephant has come out into the open.' The king addresses his elephant tamer thus: 'Come, good ele-phant tamer, tame the forest elephant. Subdue his forest habits, subdue his forest memories and intentions, subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever over leaving the forest. Get him to take delight in the town, inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings.'

When the king's ele-phant obeys his tamer's orders to get up and sit down and car-ries out his instructions, the elephant tamer trains him further in the task called imperturbability. He ties a giant plank to his iii 134 The Grade of the Tamed 993 trunk; a man with a lance in his hand sits on his neck; men with lances in their hands surround him on all sides; and the elephant tamer himself stands in front of him holding a long lance pole. When the elephant is being trained in the task of imperturbability, he does not move his forelegs or his hindlegs; he does not move his forequarters or his hiri.dquarters; he does not move his head, ears, tusks, tail, or trunk. The king's elephant is able to endure blows from spears, blows from swords, blows from arrows, blows from other beings, and the thundering sounds of drums, kettledrums, trumpets, and tomtoms. Being rid of all faults and defects, purged of flaws, he is worthy of the king, in the king's service, considered one of the factors of a king.

The Blessed One said this: (THE FOOL) 2. \"Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics of a fool, signs of a fool, attributes of a fool. What three? Here a fool is one who thinks bad thoughts, speaks bad words, and does bad deeds. If a fool were not so, how would the wise know him thus: 'This per-son is a fool, an untrue man'? But because a fool is one who thinks bad thoughts, speaks bad words, and does bad deeds, the wise know him thus: 'This person is a fool, an untrue man.' 3. \"A fool feels pain and grief here and now in three ways. If a fool is seated in an assembly or along a street or in a square and people there are discussing certain pertinent and relevant mat-ters, then, if the fool is one who kills living beings, takes what is not given, misconducts himself in sensual pleasures, speaks falsehood, and indulges in wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the basis of negligence, he thinks: 'These people are dis-cussing certain pertinent and relevant matters; these things are found in me, and I am seen engaging in those things.' This is the first kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and now. 4. \"Again, when a robber culprit is caught, a fool sees kings having many kinds of torture inflicted on him:119B [164] having him flogged with whips, beaten with canes, beaten with clubs; having his hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut off; having him subjected to the 'porridge pot,' to the 'polished-shell 1016 iii 165 Fools and Wise Men 1017 shave,' to the 'Rahu's mouth,' to the 'fiery wreath,' to the 'flaming hand,' to the 'blades of grass,' to the 'bark dress,' to the 'antelope,' to the 'meat hooks,' to the 'coins,' to the 'lye pickling,' to the 'pivoting pin,' to the 'rolled-up palliasse'; and having him splashed with boiling oil, and having him thrown to be devoured by dogs, and having him impaled alive on stakes, and having his head cut off with a sword. Then the fool thinks thus: 'Because of such evil actions as those, when a rob-ber culprit is caught, kings have many kinds of tortures inflicted on him: they have him flogged with whips ... and have his head cut off with a sword. Those things are found in me, and I am seen engaging in those things.' This is the second kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and now. 5. \"Again, when a fool is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground, then the evil actions that he did in the past - his bodi-ly, verbal, and mental misconduct - cover him, overspread him, and envelop him. Just as the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening covers, overspreads, and envelops the earth, so too, when a fool is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground, [165] then the evil actions that he did in the past - his bodily, ver-bal, and mental misconduct - cover him, overspread him, and envelop him. Then the fool thinks: 'I have not done what is good, I have not done what is wholesome, I have not made myself a shelter from anguish. I have done what is evil, I have done what is cruel, I have done what is wicked. When I pass away, I shall go to the destination of those who have not done what is good ... who have done what is wicked.' He sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. This is the third kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and now. 6. \"A fool who has given himself over to misconduct of body, speech, and mind, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, even in hell. (HELL) 7. \"Were it rightly speaking to be said of anything: 'That is utter-ly unwished for, utterly undesired, utterly disagreeable,' it is of hell that, rightly speaking, this should be said, so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in hell.\""},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"1018 Balapa1Jq.ita Sutta: Sutta 129 iii 166 When this was said, a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: \"But, venerable sir, can a simile be given?\" 8. \"It can, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One saidY99 \"Bhikkhus, sup-pose men caught a robber culprit and presented him to the king, saying: 'Sire, here is a robber culprit. Order what punishment you will for him.' Then the king said: 'Go and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears.' And they struck him in the morning with a hundred spears. Then at noon the king asked: 'How is that man?' -'Sire, he is still alive.' Then the king said: 'Go and strike that man at noon with a hundred spears.' And they struck him at noon with a hundred spears. Then in the evening the king asked: 'How is that man?' - 'Sire, he is still alive.' Then the king sai.d: 'Go and strike that man in the evening with a hundred spears.' And they struck him in the evening with a hundred spears. [166] What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that man experience pain and grief because of ., being struck with the three hundred spears?\" \"Venerable sir, that man would experience pain and grief because of being struck with even one spear, let alone three hundred.\" 9. Then, taking a small stone the size of his hand, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is the greater, this small stone that I have taken, the size of my hand, or Himalaya, the king of mountains?\" \"Venerable sir, the s~all stone that the Blessed One has taken, the size of his hand, does not count beside Himalaya, the king of mountains; it is not even a fraction, there is no comparison.\" \"So too, bhikkhus, the pain and grief that the man would experience because of being struck with the three hundred spears does not count beside the suffering of hell; it is not even a fraction, there is no comparison. 10. \"Now the wardens of hell torture him with the fivefold transfixing. They drive a red-hot iron stake through one hand, they drive a red-hot iron stake through the other hand, they drive a red-hot iron stake through one foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through the other foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through his belly. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feel-ings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result. 11. \"Next the wardens of hell throw him down and pare him with axes. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. iii 167 Fools and Wise Men 1019 Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhaust-ed its result. 12. \"Next the wardens of hell set him with his feet up and his head down and pare him with adzes.

He is cooked there in a swirl of froth. And as he is being cooked there in a swirl of froth, he is swept now up, now down, and now across. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result. 16. \"Next the wardens of hell throw him into the Great Hell. Now as to that Great Hell, bhikkhus: It has four corners and is built With four doors, one set in each side, Walled up with iron and all around And shut in with an iron roof. Its floor as well is made of iron And heated till it glows with fire. The range is a full hundred leagues Which it covers all-pervasively. 17. \"Bhikkhus, I could tell you in many ways about hellYoo So much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in hell.

A fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in the company of animals that feed on grass. 19. \"There are animals that feed on dung. They smell dung from a distance and run to it, thinking: 'We can eat, we can eat!' Just as brahmins run to the smell of a sacrifice, thinking: 'We can eat, we can eat!' so too these animals that feed on dung [168) smell dung from a distance and run to it, thinking: 'We can eat, we can eat!' And what animals feed on dung? Fowls, pigs, dogs, and jackals, and any other such animals. A fool who formerly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolu-tion of the body, after death, reappears in the company of ani-mals that feed on dung. 20. \"There are animals that are born, age, and die in darkness.

[169] A fool who for-merly delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in the company of animals that are born, age, and die in filth. 23. \"Bhikkhus, I could tell you in many ways about the animal kingdom, so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suf-fering in the animal kingdom. 24. \"Suppose a man threw into the sea a yoke with one hole in it, and the east wind carried it to the west, and the west wind carried it to the east, and the north wind carried it to the south, iii 170 Fools and Wise Men 1021 and the south wind carried it to the north. Suppose there were a blind turtle that came up once at.the end of each century. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that blind turtle put his neck into that yoke with one hole in it?\" \"He might, venerable sir, sometime or other at the end of a long period.\" \"Bhikkhus, the blind turtle would take less time to put his neck into that yoke with a single hole in it than a fool, once gone to perdition, would take to regain the human state, I say. Why is that? Because there is no practising of the Dhamma there, no practising of what is righteous, no doing of what is wholesome, no performance of merit. There mutual devouring prevails, and the slaughter of the weak. 25. \"If, sometime or other, at the end of a long period, that fool comes back to the human state, it is into a low family that he is reborn -into a family of outcasts or hunters or bamboo-workers or cartwrights or scavengers -one that is poor with little to eat and drink, surviving with difficulty, where he scarcely finds food and clothing; and he is ugly, unsightly, and misshapen, Sickly, blind, cripple-handed, lame, or paralysed; he gets no food, drink, clothes, [170] vehicles, garlands, scents and unguents, bed, lodging, and light; he misconducts himself in body, speech, artd mind, and having done that, on the dissolu-tion of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of depriva-tion, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. 26. \"Bhikkhus, suppose a gambler at the very first unlucky throw loses his child and his wife and all his property and fur-thermore goes into bondage himself, yet an unlucky throw such as that is negligible; it is a far more unlucky throw when a fool who misconducts himself in body, speech, and mind, on the dis-solution of the body, after death, reappears in a state of depriva: tion, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. This is the complete perfection of the fool's grade.1201 (THE WISE MAN) 27. \"Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics of a wise man, signs of a wise man, attributes of a wise man. What three?

I have done what is good, I have done what is wholesome, I have made myself a shelter from anguish. When I pass away, I shall go to the desti-nation of those who have not done what is eviL .. who have made themselves a shelter from anguish.'

(HEAVEN) 32. \"Were it rightly speaking to be said of anything: 'That is utterly wished for, utterly desired, utterly agreeable,' it is of heaven that, rightly speaking, this should be said, so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the happiness of heaven.\" When this was said, a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: \"But, venerable sir, can a simile be given?\" 33. \"It can, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Bhikkhus, sup-pose that a Wheel-turning Monarch1203 possessed the seven trea-sures and the four kinds of success, and because of that experi-enced pleasure and joy. 34. \"What are the seven treasures? Here, when a head-anoint-ed noble king has bathed his head on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth1204 and has ascended to the upper palace chamber for the Uposatha, there appears to him the divine wheel-treasure with its thousand spokes, its tire, and its nave, complete in every aspect.

Then the wheel-treasure turns forward rolling in the eastern direction and the Wheel-turning Monarch follows it with his four-constituent army. Now in whatever region the wheel-treasure pauses, there the Wheel-turning Monarch takes up his abode with his four-con-stituent army.

And the oppos-ing kings in the eastern direction submit to the Wheel-turning Monarch. \"Then the wheel-treasure plunges into the eastern ocean and emerges again.

On seeing him, the Wheel-turning Monarch's mind has confidence in him thus: 'It would be wonderful to ride the elephant, if he would undergo taming!' Then the elephant-trea-sure [174] undergoes taming just like a fine thoroughbred ele-phant well tamed for a long time. And it so happens that the Wheel-turning Monarch, when testing the elephant-treasure, mounts him in the morning, and after traversing the whole earth to the edge of the ocean, he returns to the royal capital to take his morning meal.

On seeing him, iii 175 Fools and Wise Men 1025 the Wheel-turning Monarch's mind has confidence in him thus: 'It would be wonderful to ride the horse, if he would undergo taming!'

Then all the (inhabitants of the] villages nearby begin their work by its light, thinking that it is day. Such is the jewel-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch. 39. \"Again, the woman-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch, beautiful, comely and graceful, possessing the supreme beauty of complexion, neither too tall nor too short, [175] neither too slim nor too stout, neither too dark nor too fair, surpassing human beauty without reaching divine beauty. The touch of the woman-treasure is such that it is like a tuft of kapok or a tuft of cotton-wool. When it is cool, her limbs are warm; when it is warm, her limbs are cool. From her body the scent of sandalwood comes forth, and from her mouth the scent of lotus-es. She rises before the Wheel-turning Monarch and retires after him. She is eager to serve, agreeable in conduct, and sweet iI) speech. Since she is never unfaithful to the Wheel-turning Monarch even in thought, how could she be so in body? Such is the woman-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch. 40. \"Again, the steward-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch. The divine eye born of past action is manifested in him whereby he sees hidden stores of treasure both with owners and ownerless.

Then the steward-treasure plunges both hands into the water and draws up a pot full of gold and bullion, and he tells the Wheel-turning Monarch: 'Is this enough, sire? Is enough done, enough offered?' -'This is enough, steward, enough is done, enough offered.' Such is the steward-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch. 41. \"Again, the counsellor-treasure appears [176] to the Wheel-turning Monarch, wise, shrewd, and sagacious, capable of getting the Wheel-turning Monarch to promote that which is worthy of being promoted, to dismiss that which should be dis-missed, and to establish that which should be established. He approaches the Wheel-turning Monarch and says: 'Sire, you remain at ease. I shall govern.'

Just as a father is dear and agree-able to his children, so too a Wheel-turning Monarch is dear and agreeable to brahmins and householders. Brahmins and house-holders, too, are dear and agreeable to a Wheel-turning Monarch. Just as children are dear and agreeable to a father, so too brahmins and householders are dear and agreeable to a iii 178 Fools and Wise Men 1027 Wheel-turning Monarch. Once a Wheel-turning Monarch was driving in a pleasure park with his four-constituent army. Then brahmins and householders went to him and spoke thus: 'Sire, drive slowly that we may see you longer.' And so he told his charioteer: [177] 'Charioteer, drive slowly that I may see the brahmins and householders longer.' This is the fourth kind of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses. \"These are the four kinds of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses. 46. \"What do you think, bhikkhus?

The Blessed One said this: 2. \"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you an exposition of non-conflict. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.\" - \"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: 3. \"One should not pursue sensual pleasure, which is low, vulgar, coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and one should not pursue self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbene-fidal. The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both extremes; giving vision, giving knowledge, it leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibban.a.12s7 One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage, and know-ing both, one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach only the Dhamma.

Forms cognizable by the eye ... sounds cognizable by the ear .. . odours cOgnizable by the nose ... flavours cognizable by the tongue ... tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sen-sual pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure -a filthy pleasure, a coarse pleasure, an ignoble pleasure. I say of this kind of pleasure that it should not be pursued, that it should not be developed, that it should not be cultivated, and that it should be feared. \"Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana ... the second jhana ... the third jhana ... the fourth jhana. This is called the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment. I say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued, that it should be developed, that it should be cultivated, and that it should not be feared.

The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 140 Dhatuvibhanga Sutta The Exposition of the Elements 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Magadhan country and eventually arrived at Rajagaha. There he went to the potter Bhaggava and said to him: 2. \"If it is not inconvenient for you, Bhaggava, I will stay one night in your workshop.\" \"It is not inconvenient for me, venerable sir, but there is a homeless one already staying there. If he agrees, then stay as long as you like, venerable sir.\" [238] 3. Now there was a clansman named Pukkusati who had gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in the Blessed One, and on that occasion he was already staying in the potter's workshop.1264 Then the Blessed One went to the vener-able Pukkusati and said to him: \"If it is not inconvenient for you, bhikkhu, I will stay one night in the workshop.\" \"The potter's workshop is large enough, friend.1265 Let the venerable one stay as long as he likes.\" 4. Then the Blessed One entered the potter's workshop, pre-pared a spread of grass at one end, and sat down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindful-ness in front of him. Then the Blessed One spent most of the night seated [in meditation], and the venerable Pukkusati also spent most of the night seated [in meditation]. Then the Blessed One thought: \"This clansman conducts himself in a way that inspires confidence. Suppose I were to question him.\" So he asked the venerable Pukkusati: 5. \"Under whom have you gone forth, bhikkhu? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?\"1266 \"Friend, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of that Blessed Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One 1087"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"1088 Dhatuvibhanga Sutta: Sutta 140 iii 239 is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' I have gone forth under that Blessed One; that Blessed One is my teacher; I profess the Dhamma of that Blessed One.\" \"But, bhikkhu, where is that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, now living?\" \"There is, friend, a city in the northern country named SavatthI. The Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living there.\" \"But, bhikkhu, have you ever seen that Blessed One before? Would you recognise him if you saw him?\" [239] \"No, friend, I have never seen that Blessed One before, nor would I recognise him if I saw him.\" 6. Then the Blessed One thought: \"This clansman has gone forth from the home life into homelessness under me. Suppose I were to teach him the Dhamma.\" So the Blessed One addressed the vener-able Pukkusati thus: \"Bhikkhu, I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.\" -\"Yes, friend,\" the venerable Pukkusati replied. The Blessed One said this: 7. \"Bhikkhu, this person consists of six elements, six bases of contact, and eighteen kinds of mental exploration, and he has four foundations.1267 The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace. One should not' neglect wisdom, should preserve truth, should cultivate relinquishment, and should train for peace. This is the summary of the exposition of the six elements. 8. \"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six elements.'l268 So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air ele-ment, the space element, and the consciousness element. So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six elements.' 9. \"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six bases of contact.' So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the base of eye-contact, the base of ear-contact, the base of nose-contact, the base of tongue-contact, the base of body-contact, and the base of mind-contact. So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six bases of contact.' iii 240 The Exposition of the Elements 1089 10. \"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental exploration.'1269 So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? On seeing a form with the eye, one explores a form productive of joy, one explores a form productive of grief, one explores a form productive of equanimity. On hearing a sound with the ear ... [240] On smelling an odour with the nose ... On tast-ing a flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the body ... On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, one explores a mind-object productive of joy, one explores a mind-object pro-ductive of grief, one explores a mind-object productive of equa-nimity. So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental exploration.' 11. '''Bhikkhu, this person has four foundations.' So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the foundation of wisdom, the foundation of truth, the foundation of relinquishment, and the foundation of peace.1270 So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person has four foundations.' 12. \"'One should not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth, should cultivate relinquishment, and should train for peace.lJ271 So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? 13. \"How, bhikkhu, does one not neglect wisdom?1272 There are these six elements: the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element, the space element, and the con-sciousness element. 14. \"What, bhikkhu, is the earth element? The earth element may be either internal or external. What is the internal earth ele-ment?

Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'

The fire element may be either internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to, that is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is con-sumed, and that by which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element.

The air element may be either internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to, that is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air ele-ment and makes the mind dispassionate towards the air element. iii 242 The Exposition of the Elements 1091 18. \"What, bhikkhu, is the space element? The space element may be either internal or external. What is the internal [242] space element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and dung-to, that is, the holes of the ears, the nos-trils, the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to: this is called the internal space element.

When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the space element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the space element. 19. \"Then there remains only consciousness, purified and bright.1273 What does one cognize with that consciousness? One cognizes: '[This is] pleasant'; one cognizes: '[This is] painful'; one cognizes: '[This is] neither-painful-nor-pleasant.' In dependence on a contact to be felt as pleasant there arises a pleasant feeling.1274 When one feels a pleasant feeling, one understands: 'I feel a pleasant feeling.' One understands: 'With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as pleasant, its corresponding feeling -the pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as pleasant -ceases and subsides.' In dependence on a contact to be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling. When one feels a painful feeling, one understands: 'I feel a painful feeling.' One understands: 'With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as painful, its corre-sponding feeling - the painful feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt as painful-ceases and subsides.'

From time to time he would blow on it, from time to time he would sprinkle water over it, and from time to time he would just look on. That gold would become refined, well refined, completely refined, faultless, rid of dross, malleable, wieldy, and radiant. Then whatever kind of ornament he wished to make from it, whether a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden garland, it would serve his purpose. So too, bhikkhu, then there remains only equanimity, purified and bright, mal-leable, wieldy, and radiant. 2l. \"He understands thus: 'If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of infinite space and to develop my mind accordingly, then this equanimity oj mine, supported by that base, clinging to.it, would remain for a very long time.1276 If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of infinite consciousness ...

He does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being.1278 Since he does not fortn iii 245 The Exposition of the Elements 1093 any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being, he does not. cling to anything in this world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agi-tated, he personally attains Nibbana. He understands thus: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.Jl279 23. \"If he feels a pleasant feeling,1280 he understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.' If he feels a painful feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.' If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.' 24. \"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with the body.' [245] When he feels a feeling terminating with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with life.'128J He understands: 'On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.'1282 Bhikkhu, just as an oil-lamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick, and when the oil and wick are used up, if it does not get any more fuel, it is extinguished from lack of fuel; so too when he feels a feeling terminating with the body ... a feeling terminating with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with life.' He understands: 'On the dissolu-tion of the body, with the ending of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.' 25. \"Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this wisdom] possesses the supreme foundation of wisdom.

For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely, the relinquishing of all attachments. 28. \"Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced cov-etousness, desire, and lust; now he has abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.

Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced ignorance and delusion; now he has abandoned them, cut them off [246] at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this peace] possesses the supreme foundation of peace. For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble peace, namely, the pacification of lust, hate, and delusion. 29. \"So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'One should not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth, should culti-vate relinquishment, and should train for peace.' 30. \"'The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiv-ing no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.t1285 So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? 31. \"Bhikkhu, 'I am' is a conceiving; 'I am this' is a conceiving; 'I shall be' is a conceiving; 'I shall not be' is a conceiving; 'I shall be possessed of form' is a conceiving; 'I shall be formless' is a conceiving; 'I shall be percipient' is a conceiving; 'I shall be non-percipient' is a conceiving; 'I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient' is a conceiving. Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a tumour, conceiving is a dart. By overcoming all conceivings, bhikkhu, one is called a sage at peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die; he is not shaken and is not agitated. For there is nothing present in him by which he might be born.12B6 Not being born, how could he age? Not ageing, how iii 247 The Exposition of the Elements 1095 could he die? Not dying, how could he be shaken? Not being shaken, why should he be agitated? 32. \"So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.' Bhikkhu, bear in mind this brief exposition of the six elements.\" 33. Thereupon the venerable Pukkusati thought: \"Indeed, the Teacher has come to me! The Sublime One has come to me! The Fully Enlightened One has come to mel\" Then he rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and prostrat-ing himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, he said: \"Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in that like a fool, confused [247] and blundering, I presumed to address the Blessed One as 'friend.' Venerable sir, may the Blessed One for-give my transgression seen as such for the sake of restraint in the future.\" \"Surely, bhikkhu, a transgression overcame you, in that like a fool, confused and blundering, you presumed to address me as 'friend.' But since you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we forgive you. For it is growth in the Noble One's Discipline when one sees one's transgression as such, makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes restraint in the future.\" 34. \"Venerable sir, I would receive the full admission under the Blessed One.\" \"But are your bowl and robes complete, bhikkhu?\" \"Venerable sir, my bowl and robes are not complete.\" \"Bhikkhu, Tathagatas do not give the full admission to anyone whose bowl and robes are not complete.\" 35. Then the venerable Pukkusati, having delighted an'd rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed in order to search for a bowl and robes. Then, while the venerable Pukkusati was searching for a bowl and robes, a stray cow killed him. 36. Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him: \"Venerable sir, the clansman Pukkusati, who was given"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"1096 Dhlituvibhanga Sutta: Sutta 140 iii 247 brief instruction by the Blessed One, has died.

He practised in accordance with the Dhammaand did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma.

The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 141 Saccavibhanga Sutta The Exposition of the Truths [248] 1. THUS HAVEl HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\" -\"Venerable sir,\" they replied.

Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some exchanged greetihgs with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some pro-nounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One said to them: 4. \"Householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus: 'Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated?' you should answer them thus: 'Those recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust, hate, and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye, whose minds are not inwardly peaceful, and who conduct themselves noW righteously, now unrighteously in body, speech and mind -such recluses and brahmins should not be , ? honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanc-tuary. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One then said to him: [294] 2. \"Sariputta, your faculties are clear. The colour of your skin is pure and bright.

The venerable Sariputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. 152 Indriyabhavana Sutta The Development of the Faculties [298] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kajangala in a grove of mukhelu trees. 2. Then the brahmin student Uttar a, a pupil of the brahmin Parasariya, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked him: \"UUara, does the brahmin Parasariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?\" \"He does, Master Gotama.\" \"But, Uttara, how does he teach his disciples the development of the faculties?\" \"Here, Master Gotama, one does not see forms with the eye, one does not hear sounds with the ear. That is how the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.\" \"If that is so, Uttar a, then a blind man and a deaf man will have developed faculties, according to what the brahmin Parasariya says. For a blind man does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf man does not hear sounds with the ear.\" When this was said, the brahmin student Uttara, Parasariya's pupil, sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response. . 3. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One addressed the venera-ble Ananda: \"Ananda, the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disci-ples the development of the faculties in one way, but in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties is otherwise.\"1352 \"Now is the time, Blessed One, now is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One [299] to teach the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble One's Discipline.

This work contains, besides a translation of the sutta, a lengthy analytical study of its philosophical sig-nificance and copious extracts from the very helpful com-mentarialliterature that has accumulated around it. Nm's rendering of this sutta in Ms was highly conjec-tural; thus, while I have retained most of his terminolo-gy, I have substituted my own rendering of the syntax to bring out the meaning that accords with the traditional interpretation and that seems warranted by the original Pali text as well. The key passages as Nm rendered them will be given in the Notes. 2 MA explains that the Buddha delivered this sutta to dis-pel the conceit that had arisen in five hundred bhikkhus on account of their erudition and intellectual mastery of the Buddha's teachings. These bhikkhus were formerJy brahmins learned in the Vedic literature, and the Buddha's cryptic utterances may well have been intend-ed to challenge the brahmanic views to which they may still have adhered. 3 Sabbadhammamulapariyaya.

The \"root of all things\" -that is, the special condition that maintains the continuity of the process' of repeated existence -MT explains to be crav-ing, conceit, and views (which are the underlying springs of \"conceiving\"), and these in tum are underlaid by igno-rance, suggested in the sutta by the phrase \"he has not fully understood it.\" 4 The \"untaught ordinary person\" (assutava puthujjana) is the common worldling, who possesses neither learning nor spiritual accomplishment in the Dhamma of the noble ones, and allows himself to be dominated by the multitude of defilements and wrong views. See Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence, pp. 40-46. 5 Pathavini pathavito saiijanati. Although perceiving \"earth as earth\" seems to suggest seeing the object as it really is, the aim of Buddhist insight meditation, the context makes it clear that the ordinary person's perception of \"earth as earth\" already introduces a slight distortion of the object, a distortion that will be blown up into full-fledged misinterpretation when the cognitive process enters the phase of \"conceiving.\" MA explains that the ordinary person seizes upon the conventional expression \"it is earth,\" and applying this to the object, perceives it through a \"perversion of perception\" (saiiiiavipallasa). The latter is a technical expression explain'ed as perceiving the impermanent as permanent, the painful as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as beautiful (AN 4:49/ii.52). Nm reads the ablatjve suffix -to of the Pali as signifying derivation and translates the phrase: \"From earth he has a percept of earth.\" 6 The Pali verb \"conceives\" (mafiiiati), from the root man, \"to think/' is often used in the Pali suttas to mean dis-tortional thinking -thought that ascribes to its object characteristics and a significance derived not from the object itself, but from its own subjective imaginings. The cognitive distortion introduced by conceiving con-sists, in brief, in the intrusion of the egocentric perspec-tive into the experience already slightly distorted by spontaneous perception. According to the commentaries, the activity of conceiving is governed by three defile-Notes to Sutta 1 1163 ments, which accounts for the different ways it comes to manifestation -craving (ta1Jhli), conceit (mana), and views (diUhi). . MA paraphrases this text thus: \"Having perceived earth with a perverted perception, the ordinary person afterwards conceives it -construes or discriminates it -through the gross proliferating tendencies (papaiica) of craving, conceit, and views, which are here called 'con-ceivings.' ... He apprehends it in diverse ways contrary [to reality].\" The four ways of conceiving (maiiiiana): The Buddha shows that the conceiving of any object may occur in any of four ways, expressed by the text as a fourfold lingUistic pattern: accusative, locative, ablative, and appropriative. The primary significance of this modal pattern -enig-matic in the Pali as well -seems to be ontological. I take the pattern to represent the diverse ways in which the ordinary person attempts to give positive being to his imagined sense of egohood by positing, below the threshold of reflection, a relationship between himself as the subject of cognition and the perceived phenomenon as its object. According to the fourfold pattern given, this relationship may be one either of direct identification (\"he conceives X\"), or of inherence (\"he conceives in X\"), or of contrast or derivation (\"he conceives from X\"), or of simple appropriation (\"he conceives X to be 'mine'''). But care is needed in interpreting these phrases. The Pali does not supply any direct object for the second and third modes, and this suggests that the process at work in conceiving proceeds from a deeper and more general level than that involved in the forming of an explicit view of selC as described for example at MN 2.8 or MN 44.7. The activity of conceiving thus seems to com-prise the entire range of subjectively tinged cognition, from the impulses and thoughts in which the sense of personal identity is still inchoate to elaborate intellectual st~ctures in which it has been fully explicated. Nm, however, understands the implicit object of con-ceiving to be the percept itself, and accordingly translates: \"having had from earth a percept of earth, he conceives"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"1164 The Majjhima Nikttya [that to be] earth, he conceives [that to be] in earth, he conceives [that to be apart] from earth,\" etc. The fifth phrase, \"he delights in X,\" explicitly connects conceiving with craving, which is elsewhere said to \"delight here and there.\" This, moreover, hints at the danger in the worldling'S thought processes, since crav-ing is pointed to by the Buddha as the origin of suffering. MA gives prolific examples illustrating all the differ-ent modes of conceiving, and these clearly establish that the intended object of conceiving is the misplaced sense of egoity. 7 MA states that one who fully understands earth does so by the three types of full understanding: the full understanding of the known (filitaparififili) -the defini-tion of the earth element by way of its unique charac-teristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause; the full understanding by scrutinization (tfra1Japarififili) -the contemplation of the earth element by way of the three general characteristics of impermanence, suffer-ing, and non-self; and the full understanding of aban-donment (pahlinaparififili) -the abandoning of desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path (of arahantship). 8 BhiUli. MA says that \"beings\" here signifies only living beings below the heaven of the Four Great Kings, the lowest of the sense-sphere heavens; the higher grades of living beings are covered by the terms to follow. MA exemplifies the application of the three types of conceiv-ing to this situation as follows: When a person becomes attached to b.eings as a result of Sight, hearing, etc., or desires rebirth in a certain class of beings, this is conceiv-ing due to craving. When he ranks himself as superior, equal, or inferior to others, this is conceiving due to con-ceit. And when he thinks, \"Beings are permanent, stable, eternal,\" etc., this is conceiving due to views. 9 MA: The gods of the six sense-sphere heavenly worlds are meant, except for Mara and his retinue in the heaven of the gods who wield power over others' creations. See the account of Buddhist cosmology in the Introduction, pp.31-33. . 10 Prajapati, \"lord of creation,\" is a name given by the Notes to Sutta 1 1165 Vedas to Indra, Agni, etc., as the highest of the Vedic divinities. But according to MA, Pajlipati here is a name for Mara because he is the ruler of this \"generation\" (pajli) made up of living beings. 11 Brahmli here is Mahabrahrna, the first deity to be born at the beginning ofa new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle. The Ministers of Brahma and the Assembly of Brahma -the other deities whose posi-tion is determined by attainment of the first jhana - are also included. 12 MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the second jhana -the gods of Limited Radiance and the gods of Immeasurable Radiance -should be includ-ed, for all these occupy a single level. 13 MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the third jhana -the gods of Limited Glory and the gods of Immeasurable Glory -should be included. 14 These are divinities on the plane of the fourth jhana. 15 Abhibha. MA says this term is a designation for the non-percipient realm, called thus because it vanquishes (abhibhavati) the four immaterial aggregates. The identifi-cation sounds contrived, especially because the word \"abhibhu\" is a masculine singular noun. Elsewhere (MN 49.5) the word appears as part of Baka the Brahrna's claim to theocratic hegemony, yet MA rejects identifying the Abhibhfl with Brahrna here as a redundancy. 16 This and the next three sections deal with conceiving in relation to the four immaterial planes of existence -the cosmological counterparts of the four immaterial medita-tive attainments. With §18 the division of conceiving by way of planes of existence is completed. . 17 In these four sections the phenomena comprising person-ality are considered as objects of perception classified into the four categories of the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. Here, sensed (muta) signifies the data of smell, taste, and touch, cognized (vififiata) the data of introspec-tion, abstract thought, and imagination. The objects of perception are \"conceived\" when they are cognized in terms of \"mine,\" \"I,\" and \"self,\" or in ways that generate craving, conceit, and views. 18 In this section and the next, the phenomena comprising"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"1166 The Majjhima Nikiiya personality are treated as twofold -by way of unity and diversity. The emphasis on unity (ekatta), MA informs us, is characteristic of one who attains the jhanas, in which the mind occurs in a single mode on a single object. The emphasis on diversity (nanatta) prevails in the case of the non-attainer who lacks the overwhelming unitive experi-ence of jhanas. Conceivings stressing diversity come to expression in philosophies of pluralism, those stressing unity in philosophies of the monistic type. 19 In this section, all phenomena of personality are collected together and shown as singlefold. This idea of totality can form the basis for philosophies of the pantheistic or monistic type, depending on the relation posited between the self and the all. 20 MA understands \"Nibbana\" here to refer to the five kinds of \"supreme Nibbana here and now\" included among the sixty-two wrong views of the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1.3.19-25/i.36-38), that is, Nibbana identified with the full enjoyment of sense pleasures or with the four jhanas. Enjoying this state, or yearning for it, he con-ceives it with craving. Priding himself on attaining it, he conceives it with conceit. Holding this imaginary Nibbana to be permanent, etc., he conceives it with views. 21 The sekha, the disciple in higher training, is one who has reached any of the three lower planes of sanctity -stream-entry; once-returning, or non-returning -but must still train further in order to reach the goal, ara-hantship, the supreme security from bondage. MN 53 is devoted to expounding the training he must undertake. The arahant is sometimes described as asekha, one beyond training, in the sense that he !tas completed the training in the Noble Eightfold Path. Nm rendered seklUl as \"initiate\" and asekha as \"adept,\" which have been changed here to avoid their\" esoteric\" connotations. . 22 It should be noted that, whereas the ordinary man IS said to perceive each of the bases, the one in higher tra~n­ing is said to directly know them (abhijanati). MA explainS that he knows them with distinguished knowledge, knows them in accordance with their real nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Nm rendered: Notes to Sutta 1 1167 \"From earth he has direct knowledge of earth.\" 23 The ~isciple in higher training is urged by the Buddha to r~fram from conceiving and delight because the disposi-tions to these mental processes still remain within him. With his attainment of stream-entry he eradicated the fet-~er of personality view and thus can no longer conceive m terms of wrong views. But the defilements of craving and conceit are only uprooted by the path of arahantship, and ~us the sekha remains vulnerable to the conceivings to which they are capable of giving rise. Whereas direct knowledge (abhiiiiia) is the province of both the sekha and the ar~hant, full understanding (pariiiiia) is the province exclUSIvely of the arahant, as it involves the full aban-doning of all defilements. 24 This is the stock description of the arahant, repeated in many suttas. 25 When ignorance has been abolished by the attainment of full understanding, the subtlest dispositions to craving and conceit are also eradicated. Thus the arahant can no longer engage in conceiving and delight. 26 This section and the following two are stated to show that the arahant does not conceive, not orily because he has fully understood the object, but because he has eradi-cated the three unwholesome roots -lust (or greed), hate, and del~sion. The\" phrase \"free from lust through the destructIOn of lust is used to stress that the arahant is not merely temporarily without lust, but has destroyed it at the most fundamental level. Similarly with hate and delusion. 27 On this word, the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring to himself, see the Introduction, p. 24. The commentaries give a long detailed etymology, into which they try to compress virtually the entire Dhamma. The passage has been translated in Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views, pp. 331-44. 28 Pariiiiiatantam tathagatassa. So BBS and SBJ eds. and MA, though PTS ed. reads simply pariiiiiatam. MA glosses: \"fully understood to the conclusion, fully understood to the limit, fully understood without remainder.\" It explains that while Buddhas and disciple-arahants are"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"1168 The Majjhima Nikaya alike in abandoning all defilements, there is a distinction in their range of full understanding: whereas disciples can attain Nibbana after comprehending with insight only a limited number of formations, Buddhas fully understand all formations without exception. 29 This sentence gives a highly compressed statement of the formula of dependent origination (paticca samuppada), usually expounded in twelve factors (as in MN 38). As interpreted by MA, \"delight\" is the craving of the previ-ous life that brought into being the \"suffering\" of the five aggregates in the present life, \"being\" the kammically determinative aspect of the present life that causes future birth, followed by future ageing and death. This passage shows the cause for the Buddha's elimination of conceiv-ing to be his penetration of dependent origination on the night of his enlightenment. The mention of \"delight\" (nandl) as the root of suffering links up with the sutta's title; moreover, by referring to the earlier statement that the ordinary person delights in earth, etc., it shows suf-fering to be the ultimate consequence of delight. 30 MA explains the sequence of ideas thus: The Tathagata does not conceive earth and does not delight in earth because he has understood that delight is the root of suf-fering. Further, by understanding dependent origina-tion, he has completely abandoned the craving here called \"deligl'lt\" and has awakened to supreme full enlightenment. As a result he does not conceive earth or delight in earth. 31 The bhikkhus did not delight in the Buddha's words, apparently because the discourse probed too deeply into the tender regions of their own conceit, and perhaps their residual brahmanic views. At a later time, MA tells us, when their pride had been humbled, the Buddha. expounded to these same bhikkhus the Gotamaka Sutta (AN 3:123/i.276), in the course of which they all attained arahantship. SUTTA 2 32 The taints (llsava), a category of defilements existing at Notes to Sutta 2 1169 the deepest and most fundamental level, are discussed in the Introduction, p. 38. MA explains that restraint (samvara) is fivefold: through virtue, mindfulness, knowl-edge, energy, and patience. In the present sutta, restraint through virtue is illustrated by avoiding unsuitable seats and r~s?rts (§19); restraint through mindfulness, by restraInIng the sense faculties (§12); restraint through know~edge, by the repeated phrase \"reflecting wisely\"; restramt through energy, by the removing of unwhole-some thoughts (§20); and restraint through patience, by the passage on enduring (§18). 33 Wise attention (yoniso manasikara) is glossed as attention th~t is the :ight means (upaya), on the right track (patha). It IS explamed as mental advertence, consideration, or ~reoccupation that accords with the truth, namely, atten-tIon to the impermanent as impermanent, etc. Unwise attention (ayoniso manasikara) is attention that is the wrong means, on the wrong track (uppatha), contrary to the truth, namely, attention to the impermanent as per-manent, the painful as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as beautiful. Unwise attention MA informs us, is at the root of the round of existence, for it causes ignorance and craving to increase; wise attention is at the root of liberation from the round, since it leads to the development of the Noble Eightfold Path. MA sums up the point of this passage thus: the destruction of the taints is for one who knows how to arouse wise attention and who sees to it that unwise attention does not arise. 34 ~ix of these -o~itting the taints to be abandoned by see-Ing -are mentioned in the catechism on the taints in AN 6:58/iii.387-90. 35 The word \"seeing\" (dassana) here refers to the first of the fou: su~ramundane paths -the path of stream-entry (sotapattlmagga) -so designated because it offers the first glimpse of Nibbana. The higher three paths are called the p~t!'s of de~elopment (bhavana) because they develop the VISIOn of NIbbana to the point at which all defilements are eradicated. 36 MA makes the important point that there is no fixed determination in -things themselves as to whether they 'f"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"1170 The Majjhima Nikaya are fit or unfit for attention. The distinction consists, rather in the mode of attention. That mode of attention that i~ a causal basis for unwholesome states of mind should 'be avoided, while that mode of attention that is a causal basis for wholesome states should be developed. This same principle applies to §9. 37 MA illustrates the growth of the taints through unwise attention as follows: When he attends to gratification in the five cords of sensual pleasure, the taint of sensual desire arises and increases; when he attends to gratifica-tion in the exalted states (the jhanas), the taint of being arises and increases; and when he attends to any mundane things through the four \"perversion~\" (of pe:manence, etc. - see n.5), the taint of ignorance anses and mcreases. 38 According to MA, this passage is undertaken .to sho:w the taint of views (ditthasava, not expressly mentloned m the discourse) under the heading of doubt. However, it might be more correct to say that the taint of views, dis-closed by §8, emerges out of unwise attention in the form of doubt. The various types of doubt are already preg-nant with the wrong views that will come to explicit expression in the next section. . 39 Of these six views, the first two represent the sImple antinomy of eternalism and annihilationism; the .view that \"no self exists for me\" is not the.non-self doctrme of the Buddha, but the materialist view that identifies the individualwith the body and thus holds that there is no personal continuity beyond death. The nex~ three -:iews may be understood to arise out of the ?hIlosophICa~ly more sophisticated observation that expenence h~s a built-, in reflexive structure that allows for self-consclOusness, the capacity of the mind to become cognizant of itself, its contents, and the body with which it is inter-connected. Engaged in a search for his \"true .nature,.\" the untaught ordinary person will identify self eIther WIth both aspects of the experience (view 3), or with the observer alone (view 4), or with the observed alone (:iew.5). TI:e last view is a full-blown version of eternahsm m WhICh all reservations have been discarded. 40 The self as speaker represents the conception of the ~elf as the agent of action; the self as feeler, the conceptlOn Notes to Sutta 2 1171 of the self as the passive subject. \"Here and there\" sug-gests the self as the transmigrating entity that retains its identity through a succession of different incarnations. The same view is maintained by the bhikkhu Sati at MN38.2. 41 This is, of course, the formula for the Four Noble Truths, treated as a subject of contemplation and insight. MA says that up to the attainment of the path of stream-entry, attention denotes insight (vipassana), but at the moment of the path it denotes path-knowledge. Insight directly apprehends the first two truths, since its objec-tive range is the mental and material phenomena com-prised under dukkha and its origin; it can know the latter two truths only inferentially. Path-knowledge makes the truth of cessation its object, apprehending it ~y penetra-tion as object (aramma1Ja). Path-knowledge performs four functions regarding the four truths: it fully understands the truth of suffering, abandons the origin of suffering, realises the cessation of suffering, and develops the way to the cessation of suffering. 42 The path of stream-entry has the function of cutting off the first three fetters binding to sarilsara. MA says that personality view and adherence to rules and obser-vances, being included in the taint of views, are taints as well as fetters, while doubt is (ordinarily) classified as only a fetter, not a taint; but because it is included here among the \"taints to be abandoned by seeing,\" it may be spoken of as a taint. 43 If abandonment of the taints is understood in the strict sense as their ultimate destruction, then only two of the seven methods mentioned in the sutta effect their aban-donment -seeing and development -which between them comprise the four supramundane paths. The other five methods cannot directly accomplish the destruction of the taints, but they can keep them under control during the preparatory stages of practice and thereby facilitate their eventual eradication by the supramundane paths. 44 The primary factor responsible for exercising this restraint over the sense faculties is mindfulness. A fuller formula for sense restraint is given in many other suttas -e.g., MN 27.15 -and analysed in detail at Vsm I, 53-59."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"1172 The Majjhima Nikiiya MA explains \"fever\" (parilaha) in the above passage as the fever of defilements and of their (kammic) results. 45 The pas.sages that follow here have become the standard formulas that bhikkhus use in their daily reflections upon the four requisites of the holy life. They are explained in detail at Vsm 1,85-97. 46 Unsuitable seats are the two kinds mentioned in the Patimokkha - sitting with a woman on a screened seat convenient for sexual intercourse, and sitting alone with a woman in a private place. Various kinds of unsuitable resort are mentioned at Vsm I, 45. 47 The first three types of unwholesome thought - of sensual desire, ill will, and cruelty - constitute wrong thought or wrong intention, the opposite of the second factor of the Noble Eightfold Path. The three types of wrong thought and their opposites are dealt with more fully in MN 19. 48 These are the seven enlightenment factors (satta bojjhanga) included among the thirty-~even requisites of enlightenment, and treated more extensively below at MN 10.42 and MN 118.29-40. The present section explains the seven enlightenment factors specifically as aids for developing the three higher supramundane paths, by which the taints that escaped eradication by the first path will be eradicated. The terms \"seclusion\" (vive-ka), \"dispassion\" (viraga), and \"cessation\" (nirodha) may all be understood as referring to Nibbana. Their use in this context signifies that the development of the enlight-enment factors is directed to Nibbana as its goal during the preparatory stages of the path, and as its object with the attainment of the supramundane paths. MA explains that the word vossagga, rendered as \"relinquishment,\" has the two meanings of \"giving up\" (pariccaga), i.e., the abandonment of defilements, and \"entering into\" (pakkhandana), i.e., culminating in Nibbana. 49 The taint of sensual desire is eradicated by the path of non-returning, the taints of being and of ignorance only by the final path, that of arahantship. 50 The ten fetters that must be destroyed to gain full deliV-erance have been enumerated in the Introduction, pp. 42-43. Conceit, at the most subtle level, is the conceit Notes to Suttas 2 and 3 1173 \"I am,\" which lingers in the mental continuum until the attainment of arahantship. The \"penetration of conceit\" (mllnabhisamaya) means seeing through conceit and aban-doning it, which are both accomplished simultaneously by the path of arahantship. The bhikkhu has \"made an end of suffering\" in the sense that he has put an end to the suffering of the round of sarilsara (vattadukkha). SUITA3 51 MA: The Buddha delivered this sutta because many bhikkhus were becoming elated over the gains and hon-our accruing to the Sangha, to the neglect of their spiritu-al training. The Buddha obviously could not lay down a training rule prohibiting the use of the requisites, but he wanted to show the practice of the heirs in Dhamma to those bhikkhus who were earnestly desirous of training. 52 MA explains that these five qualities gradually fulfil all the stages of the practice culminating in arahantship. 53 Elder bhikkhus (thera) are those with more than ten rainy seasons since ordination (upasampada); middle bhikkhus have between five and nine rains; new bhikkhus less than five rains. 54 The evil qualities mentioned here, and in the sections that follow, are introduced to show the states referred to above (§6) by the statement: \"They do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon.\" They are also the fac-tors that induce a bhikkhu to become an heir of material things rather than an heir of Dhamma. In MN 7.3 the same sixteen qualities, with \"ill will\" substituted for \"hate,\" are referred to as \"the imperfections that defiI'e the mind\" (cittass' upakkilesa). 55 The Noble Eightfold Path is introduced here to show the practice that makes one an \"heir in Dhamma.\" The antithesis between the defilements and the path restates, from a new angle, the contrast between \"heirs in material things\" and \"heirs in Dhamma\" with which the Buddha had opened the sutta."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"1174 The ]vJ.ajjhima Nikilya SUITA4 56 MA says that JaJ)ussoJ)i was not a given name but an honorific title meaning \"royal chaplain\" (purohita) bestowed on him by the king.

Nm ren-ders: \"Do these people follow the implications of Master Gotama's view?\" And Horner: \"These people emulate the views of the honoured Gotama\" (MLS 1:22). MA, too, glosses: \"These people have the same view, opinion, outlook as Master Gotama.\" However, it makes much better sense in this context to read dittha not as a sandhi form of dinhi, but as the past participle, and to take this phrase as meaning \"following what they have seen of him,\" i.e., his example. This meaning is clearly required by the phrase in its appearances at SN ii.203, AN i.126, AN iii.108, 251, 422. 58 Nm originally had rendered this phrase as \"perfect in understanding,\" and the corresponding phrase in the preceding section as \"perfect in concentration.\" However, since it seems inappropriate to ascribe perfec-tion in samadhi and panflil to the Bodhisatta prior to his enlightenment, I have chosen to render the suffix sam-panna throughout as \"possessed of.\" MA explains that this is neither the wisdom of insight nor of the path, but the wisdom that defines the nature of its object (arammaIJavavatthanapanna). 59 The Indian year, according to the ancient system inherit-ed by Buddhism, is divided into three seasons - the cold season, the hot season, and the rainy season - each last-ing for four months. The four months are subdivided into eight fortnights (pakkha), the third and the seventh containing fourteen days and the others fifteen dayS. Within each fortnight, the nights of the full moon and the new moon (either the fourteenth or fifteenth) and the night of the half-moon (the eighth) are regarded as espe-cially auspicious. Within Buddhism these days become the Uposatha, the days of religious observance. On t~e full moon and new moon days the bhikkhus recite thell\" Notes to Sutta 4 1175 code of precepts and lay people visit the monasteries to listen to sermons and to practise meditation. 60 The four postures (iriyapatha) often mentioned in the Bud-dhist texts are walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. 61 Beginning with this section, the Buddha shows the course of practice that led him to the peak of non-delusion. 62 MA says that the Bodhisatta developed the four jhanas using mindfulness of breathing as his meditation subject. 63 Explained in detail at Vsm XIII, 13-71. 64 Explained in detail at Vsm XIII, 72-101. 65 MA: Having shown the Four Noble Truths in their own nature (that is, in terms of suffering), the passage on the taints is stated to show them indirectly by way of the defilements. 66 According to MA, the phrase \"When I knew and saw thus\" refers to insight and the path, which reaches its cli-max in the path of arahantship; the phrase \"my mind was liberated\" shows the moment of the fruit; and the phrase \"there came the knowledge: 'It is liberated'\" shows reviewing knowledge (see Vsm XXII, 20-21), as does the next sentence beginning \"I directly knew.\" 67 This is the stock canonical atUlouncement of final knowl-edge or arahantship. MA explains that the statement \"Birth is destroyed\" means that any type of birth that might have arisen if the path had not been developed has been rendered incapable of arising by the development of the path. The \"holy life\" that has been lived is the holy life of the path (maggabrahmacariya). The phrase \"what had to be done has been done\" (katam karaIJfyam) indi-cates that the four tasks of the noble path - fully under-' standing suffering, abandoning its origin, realising its cessation, and developing the path -have now all been completed for each of the four supramundane paths. The fourth phrase, nliparam itthattttya, is glossed by MA thus: \"Now there is no need for me to develop the path again for 'such a state,' i.e., for the sixteenfold function (of the path) or for the destruction of the defilements. Or alter-natively: after 'such a state,' i.e., the continuum of aggre-gates now occurring, there is no further continuum of aggregates for me. These five aggregates, having been"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"1176 The Majjhima Nikaya fully understood, stand like trees that are cut at the root. With the cessation of the last consciousness, they will be extinguished like a fire without fuel.\" I have opted for the second of these interpretations, but take itthattaya as a dative. The word, which literally means \"the state of this\" or \"the state of thus,\" implies manifestation in a concrete state of existence. Nm had rendered: \"There is no more of this beyond.\" 68 MA: He has\" compassion for future generations\" insofar as later generations of monks, seeing that the Buddha resort~ ed to forest dwellings, will follow his example and thus hasten their progress towards making an end of suffering. SUITAS 69 MA, picking up on the venerable Sariputta's use of the word \"person\" (puggala), explains that the Buddha has a twofold teaching - a conventional teaching (sammuti~ desana) expressed in terms of persons, beings, women, and men, etc.; and an ultimate teaching (paramatthadesana) expressed solely in terms that possess ultimate ontologi~ cal validity, such as aggregates, elements, sense bases, impermanent, suffering, not self, etc. The Buddha expounds his teaching through whichever approach is best suited to epable the hearer to penetrate the meaning, dispel delusion, and achieve distinction. The use of the word \"person,\" therefore, does not imply a misconcep-tion of the person as a self. 70 Subhanimitta: an attractive object that is the basis for lust. The Buddha says that unwise attention to the sign of the beautiful is the nutriment (ahara) for the arising of unarisen sensual desire and for the growth and increase of arisen sensual desire (SN 46:2/v.64). 71 These are strict ascetic practices. The forest dweller, almsfood eater, house-to-house seeker and refuse-rag wearer are explained in Vsm II. 72 These are \"softer\" practices than those referred to in §29, generally regarded as signs of a less earnest commitment to exertion for the sake of the goal. 73 The Ajlvakas, or Ajlvikas, were a rival sect whose teach-ing emphasised severe austerities based on a philosophY Notes to Suttas 5 and 6 1177 borde:ing on fatalism.

Just as SamIti planed the fa~lts ~ut of the felloe as if he knew Pat).c;luputta's heart With hIS Own heart, so does Sariputta plane out the faults of the bhikkhus as if he knew Moggallana's wish to have them removed.

The niigas are a class of dragonlike beings in IndIan mythology believed to inhabit the nether regions of the earth and to be the guardians of hidden treasures. The word comes to represent any gigantic or powerful crea-~e, such as a tusker elephant or a cobra and, by exten-SIon, an arahant bhikkhu. See Dhp, ch. 23, Nagavagga. SVITA 6 76 MA says that the expression sampannasrlil, translated here a~ \"p~sses~ed of virtue,\" can mean either \"perfect in vIr~e (panpU1J1Jasrlil) or \"endowed with virtue\" (srlasam-angmo). The Patimokkha is the code of monastic disci-pline, which in its Pali version consists of 227 rules. :'Resort\" (gocara) implies a proper resort for alms, though It may also signify the proper deportment of a monk, his serene and self-possessed bearing. The key terms in this passage are analysed at Vsm I, 43-52. 77 MA: The passage beginning with \"let him fulfil the pre-cepts,\" repeated for each of the following sections until the end of the sutta, comprises the entire threefold t:aining. Th.e ?hr~se a?out fulfilling the precepts signi-fies the\"trammg m hIgher virtue (adhisllasikkhii); the phrase be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not ~eglect medi~ation\" indicates the training in concentra-~on or the hIgher mind (adhicittasikkha); and the phrase '?e poss~ssed of insight\" points to the training in the higher WIsdom (adhipafLfLiisikkhii).

The non-returner is reborn in a special region of the Brahma-world called the Pure Abodes, and there makes an end of suffering. 82 §§14-19 present the six kinds of direct knowledge (abhiiiiia). See Introduction, p. 37; for details, see Vsm XII and XIII. 83 MA: In this passage \"mind\" and \"wisdom\" signify, respectively, the concentration and wisdom associated with the fruit of arahantship. Concentration is called \"deliverance ot mind\" (cetovimutti) because it is liberated from lust; wisdom is called \"deliverance by wisdom\" (pafifiavimutti) because it is liberated from ignorance. The former is normally the result of serenity, the latter the result of insight. But when they are coupled and described as taintless (anasava), they jointly result from the destruction of the taints by the supra mundane path of arahantship. SUTIA 7 84 For a more thorough treatment of this sutta and the fol-lowing one, with helpful introductions and le.n~thY explanatory notes, see Nyanaponika Thera, The 51mtle of the Cloth and The Discourse on Effacement. Notes to Sutta 7 1179 85 An unhappy destination (duggati) is rebirth in the three states of deprivation - hell, the animal kingdom, and the realm of ghosts. A happy destination (sugati), mentioned just below, is rebirth in a superior state among humans and in the heavenly worlds. 86 Cittassa upakkilesa. The word upakkilesa is sometimes used in the sense of blemishes or imperfections of meditative concentration, as at MN 128.27, 30; sometimes in the sense of blemishes or imperfections of insight, as at Vsm XX, 105; and sometimes to signify the minor defile-ments that arise from the three unwholesome roots -greed, hate, and delusion -either as their modes or their offshoots. Here it is used in this third sense, but to main-tain the connection with its first two usages, it has been translated by the phrase \"imperfections that defile the mind.\" 87 MA offers several tentative distinctions between cov-etousness (abhijjha) and unrighteous greed (visamalobha), but then it points out that since, from the standpoint of the higher training, all greed is unrighteous, the two terms can be understood as merely different names for the same mental factor, greed or lust. 88 MA says that the abandoning spoken of here should be understood as \"abandonment by eradication\" (samuc-chedappahana), that is, complete uprooting by the supra-mundane path. The sixteen defilements are abandoned by the noble paths in the following order: 1. The path of stream-entry abandons: contempt, a domi-neering attitude, envy, avarice, deceit, fraud. 2. The path of non-returning abandons: ill will, anger, revenge, negligence. . 3. The path of arahantship abandons: covetousness and unrighteous greed, obstinacy, presumption, conceit, arrogance, vanity. MA maintains, by reference to an ancient exegetical source, that in this passage the path of the non-returner is being described. Therefore we must understand that those defilements to be fully abandoned by the path of arahantship have at this point only been abandoned in part, by way of their coarser manifestations."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"1180 The Majjhima Nikaya 89 Perfect confidence (aveccappas\"ada) ih the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha is an attribute of a noble disci-ple at the minimal level of a stream-enterer, whose confi-dence is perfect because he has seen the truth of the Dhamma for himself. The formulas for recollection of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha given here are explained at length in V sm VII. 90 This translation follows the reading yatodhi and MA's explanation of this as the partial abandoning of defile-ments by the first three paths, contrasted with the total (anodhi) abandoning of defilements by the fourth and final path. Nm, following the reading yathodhi, translates: \"And whatever [from among those imperfections] has, according to the limitation [set by whichever of the first three paths he has attained], been given up, has been [forever] dropped, let go, abandoned, relinquished.\" 91 Labhati atthavedam Iabhati dhammavedam. Ven. Nyana-ponika renders: \"He gains enthusiasm for the goal, gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma.\" MA explains veda as meaning joy and the knowledge connected with that joy, and says: \"Atthaveda is the inspiration arisen in one who reviews his perfect confidence; dhammaveda is the inspira-tion arisen in one who reviews the abandonment of the defilements in part, the cause of that perfect confidence.\" 92 The Pali equivalents, in noun form, for the terms in this series are: pamajja, gladness; plti, rapture; passaddhi, tran-quillity; sukha, pleasure; samadhi, concentration. Tranquillity, by removing the subtle bodily and mental disturbances connected with gladness and rapture, brings the serene pleasure that prepares the mind for deepened concentration. 93 The Pali terms are: evamsrlo evamdhammo evampaiiiio. The middle term, in this context, obviously must refer to the second stage of the threefold training, concentration, though it is puzzling why samadhi itself is not used. The commentary to MN 123.2 glosses a parallel expression by samadhi-pakkha-dhamma, \"states belonging to concentra-tion.\" 94 This statement underscores his attainment of the stage of non-returner. Since the non-returner has eradicated sen-Notes to Sutfa 7 1181 sual desire, delicious food cannot impede him in his quest for the fmal path and fruit. 95 §§13-16 present the standard sutta fonnulas for the four \"divine abodes\" (brahmavihtira). Briefly, loving-kindness (melta) is the wish for the welfare and happiness of oth-ers; compassion (karu1J.ii), the empathy with them in their suffering; appreciative joy (mudita), rejoicing in their virtues and success; and equanimity (upekkha), the atti-tude of detached impartiality towards beings (not apathy or indifference). For a fuller treatment, see Vsm IX. 96 1<1A: The present section shows the non-returner's practice of insight meditation aimed at arahantship and the fol-lowing section his attainment of arahantship. The phrase \"there is this\" signifies the truth of suffering; \"there is the inferior,\" the origin of suffering; \"the superior,\" the truth of the path; and \"the escape from this whole field of per-ception\" is Nibbana, the cessation of suffering. 97 MA: The Buddha used this phrase to arouse the atten-tion of the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja, who was in the assembly and believed in purification by ritual bathing. The Buddha foresaw that the brahmin would be inspired to take ordination under him and would attain arahantship. 98 These are rivers and fords that were popularly believed to gIve purification. 99 The Pali has phaggu, a day of brahmanical purification in the month of Phagguna (February-March), and uposatha, the religious observance days regulated by the lunar cal-endar. See h.59. 100 The going forth (pabbajja) is the formal ordination of entering the homeless life as a novice (sama1J.era); the full admission (upasampadii) confers the status of a bhikkhu, a full member of the Sangha.

Views associat-ed with doctrines about the world (lokavadapatisarflyutta) are the eight views: the world is eternal, non-eterna~, both, or neither; the world is infinite, finite, both, or neI-ther. See MN 63 and MN 72 for the Buddha's rejection of these views. 103 MA: This question refers to one who has only reached the initial stages of insight meditation without attaining stream-entry. The type of abandonment under discussion is abandoning by eradication, which is effected only by the path of stream-entry. Ven. Maha Cunda po~ed t~is question because some meditators were overestlmatmg their achievement, thinking they had abandoned such views while they had not really eradicated them. 104 MA explains that the word \"arise\" (uppajjanti) refers here to the arising of views that have not arisen before; \"underlie\" (anusenti) to their gathering strength through continued adherence to them; and being \"exercised\" (samudacaranti) to their gaining bodily or verbal expres-sion. The \"object\" upon which they are based is the five aggregates (khandha) that constitute a person or living being - material form, feeling, perception, mental forma-tions, and consciousness. . . 105 By this statement' the Buddha shows the ~eans by w~ch these views are eradicated: contemplahon of the five aggregates as \"not mine,\" etc., with the wisdom of insight culminating in the path of stream-entry. 106 MA explains that the Buddha, having answered th.e Elder's question, now speaks of another type of overesti-mater - those who attain the eight meditative attainments and believe that they are practising true effacement (sallekha). The word sallekha, originally meaning austerity or ascetic practice, is used by the Buddha to signify the radical effacing or removal of defilements. Thoug~ t~e eight attainments are elsewhere placed securely WIthin the Buddhist training (see MN 25.12-19, MN 26.34-41), it is here said that they should not be called effacement because the bhikkhu who attains them does not use Notes to Sutta 8 1183 them as a basis for insight - as described for example in MN 52 and MN 64 -but only as a means of enjoying bliss and peace. 107 The forty-four \"modes of effacement\" to be expounded fall, by and large, into several fixed sets of doctrinal cate-gories as follows. Those not mentioned here do not fit into any fixed set. (2)-(11) are the ten courses of unwholesome and whole-some action (kammapatha) -see MN 9.4, 9.6; (12)-(18) are the last seven factors of the eightfold path -wrong and right -the first factor being identical with (11); (19)-(20) are sometimes added to the two eightfold paths - see MN 117.34-36; (21)-(23) are the last three of the five hindrances - see MN 10.36 -the first two being identical with (9) and (10); (24)-(33) are ten of the sixteen imperfections that defile the mind, mentioned in MN 7.3; (37)-(43) are the seven bad qualities and the seven good qualities (saddhamma) mentioned in MN 53.11-17. 108 MT: Non-cruelty (avihirflsa), which is a synonym for com-passion, is mentioned at the beginning because it is the root of all virtues, especially the root-cause of morality. 109 MA: This is a description of those who hold firmly to a view that has occurred to them, believing \"This alone is the truth\"; they do not relinquish it even if spoken to by the Buddha with reasoned arguments. 110 MA: The inclination of mind is of great benefit because it entails excluSively welfare and happiness, and because it is the cause of the subsequent actions that conform to it: 111 The Pali term rendered by \"extinguished\" is parinibbuto, which can also mean \"attained to Nibbana\"; and the Pali term rendered by \"help extinguish\" is parinibbapessati, which can also mean \"help attain Nibbana\" or \"bring to Nibbana.\" The Pali original for the expression to follow, \"by which to extinguish it,\" parinibbanaya, might have been rendered \"for attaining Nibbana.\" Though in all three cases the alternative rendering would be too strong to insist on literally, its implications contribute to the"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"1184 The Majjhima Nikliya suggestiveness of the original in a way that cannot be captured in translation. 112 MA points out that this statement can be understood in two ways: (1) one who is himself free from cruelty can use his non-cruelty to help extinguish the cruelty of another person; and (2) one who is himself cruel can develop non-cruelty to extinguish his own cruel disposi-tion. All the following cases should be similarly under-stood in this twofold way. 113 MA: The compassionate teacher's task is the correct teaching of the Dhamma; beyond that is the practice, which is the work of the disciples. SurrA 9 114 MA: Right view is twofold: mundane and supramun-dane. Mundane right view is again twofold: the view that kamma produces its fruits, which may be held both by Buddhists and outsiders, and the view that accords with the Four Noble Truths, which is exclusive to the Buddha's Dispensation. Supramundane right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths attained by pen-etrating to the four paths and fruits of sanctity. The ques-tion posed by the Yen. Sariputta concerns the sekha, the disciple in higher training, who possesses supramundane right view leading irreversibly to emancipation. This is implied by the phrase \"perfect confidence\" and \"arrived at this true Dhamma.\" 115 Here the unwholesome (akusala) is explained by the ten unwholesome courses of action. The first three of these pertain to bodily action, the middle four to verbal action, the last three to mental action. The ten are explained at greater length at MN 41.8-10. 116 These three are called the roots of the unwholesome because they motivate all unwholesome actions. For a thorough and informative textual study of these factors and their opposites, see Nyanaponika Thera, The Roots of Good and Evil . 117 These ten wholesome courses of action are elaborated upon in MN 41.12-14. Notes to Sutta 9 1185 118 MA explains the disciple's understanding of these four terms by way of the Four Noble Truths thus: all the courses of action are the truth of suffering; the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the origin; the non-occurrence of both actions and their roots is the truth of cessation; and the noble path that realises cessation is the truth of the path. To this extent a noble disciple at one of the first three stages has been described - one who has arrived at supramundane right view but has not yet eliminated all defilements. 119 The passage from \"he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust\" until \"he makes an end of suffering\" shows the work accomplished by the paths of the non-returner and of arahantship - the elimination of the most subtle and obstinate defilements and the achievement of final knowledge. Here, the underlying tendencies to sen-suallust and aversion are eliminated by the path of the non-returner, the underlying tendency to the view and conceit \"I am\" and ignorance by the path of arahantship. MA explains that the expression \"underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am'\" (asmI ti ditthimananusaya) should be interpreted to mean the underlying tendency to conceit that is similar to a view because, like the view of self, it occurs apprehending the notion \"I am.\" 120 Nutriment (ahara) is to be understood here in a broad sense as a prominent condition for the individual life-continuity. Physical food (kabalinkiira ahara) is an impor-tant condition for the physical body, contact for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and consciousness for mentality-materiality, the psychophysical organism in its totality. Craving is called the origin of nutriment in th'at the craving of the previous existence is the source of the present individuality with its dependence upon and con-tinual consumption of the four nutriments in this exis-tence. For an annotated compilation of the canonical and commentarial texts on the nutriments, see Nyanaponika Thera, The Four Nutriments of Life. 121 The next twelve sections present, in reverse order, a fac-tor-by-factor examination of dependent origination. The principal terms of the formula are explained briefly in the"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"1186 The Majjhima Nikaya Introduction, pp. 30-31. The detailed exegesis is in Vsm XVII. Here each factor is patterned after the Four Noble Truths. 122 This refers to the five aggregates. See MN 10.38 and MN44.2. 123 The six bases for contact are enumerated at §50 below. 124 The three kinds of being are explained in the Intro-duction, pp. 46--48, in the discussion of Buddhist cosmol-ogy. Here, by \"being\" should be understood both the actual planes of rebirth and the types of kamma that generate rebirth into those planes. 125 Clinging to rules and observances is the adherence to the view that purification can be achieved by adopting cer-tain external rules or following certain observances, par-ticularly of ascetic self-discipline; clinging to a doctrine of self is synonymous with personality view in one or another of its twenty forms (see MN 44.7); clinging to views is the clinging to all other types of views except the two mentioned separately. Clinging in any of its varieties represents a strengthening of craving, its condition. 126 Craving for mind-objects (dhammatmJha) is the craving for all objects of consciousness except the objects of the five kinds of sense consciousness. Examples would be the craving for fantasies and mental imagery, for abstract ideas and intellectual systems, for feelings and emotional states, etc:. ' 127 Contact (phassa) is explained at MN 18.16 as the meeting of sense faculty, its object, and consciousness. 128 Mind-base (manayatana) is a collective term for all classes of consciousness. One part of this base - the \"life contin-uum\" (bhavanga) or subliminal consciousness - is the \"door\" for the arising of mind-consciousness. See n.l30. 129 Mentality-materiality (namarupa) is an umbrella term for the psychophysical organism exclusive of consciousness. The five mental factors mentioned under nama are indispensable to consciousness and thus pertain to all conscious experience. The four great elements concretely represent matter's essential properties of solidity, cohe-sion, heat, and distension. The material form derived from the elements includes, according to the Abhidham-130 131 132 Notes to Suttas 9 and 10 1187 rna analysis, the sensitive substance of the five sense fac-ulties; four sense objects - colour, sound, smell, and taste (tangible~ be~g the three elements of earth, fire, and air); the phYSIcal hfe faculty, nutritive essence, sex determina-tion, and other types of material phenomena. See also the Introduction, p. 56. M!nd-consciousness (manovififia1Ja) comprises all con-SCIOusness except the five types of sense consciousness just mentioned. It includes consciousness of mental images, abstract ideas, and internal states of mind, as well as the consciousness in reflection upon sense objects. In the context of the doctrine of dependent origination formations (sankhara) are wholesome and unwholesom~ volitions, or, in short, kamma. The bodily formation is volitio~ that is expressed through the body, the verbal formatIon volition that is expressed by speech, and the mental formation volition that remains internal without coming to bodily or verbal expression. It should be noted that while ignorance is a condition for the taints, t~e taints -which include the taint of igno-rance -: are In turn a condition for ignorance. MA says that this conditiOning of ignorance by ignorance should be. understood to mean that the ignorance in anyone ~xIste~ce is conditioned by the ignorance in the preced-mg eXIstence. Since this is so, the conclusion follows that no first point can be discovered for ignorance, and thus that samsara is without discernible beginning. SUTIA 10 133 This is one of the most important suttas in the PaH Canon, containing the most comprehensive statement of the most direct way to the attainment of the Buddhist goal. Virtually the identical sutta is found as well at DN 22, though with an expanded analysis of the Four Noble Truths attached, which accounts for its greater length. The sutta, its commentary, and copious extracts from its difficult but illUminating subcommentary have been presented together in translation by Soma Thera in The Way of Mindfulness. A very readable translation of the"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"1188 The Majjhima Nikaya sutta, with a modern commentary excelling in clarity and depth, will be found in Nyanaponika Thera, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation. 134 This town is said by some scholars to have been in the vicinity of modern Delhi. 135 The Pali reads ektiyano ayam bhikkhave maggo, and virtually all translators understand this as a statement upholding satipatthlina as an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: \"This is the only way, 0 bhikkhus,\" and Ven. Nyanaponika: \"This is the sole way, monks.\" Nm, how-ever, points out that ektiyana magga at MN 12.37-42 has the unambiguous contextual meaning of \"a path that goes in one way only,\" and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The expression used here, \"the direct path,\" is an attempt to preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explains ekayana magga as a single path, not a divided path; as a way that has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way that goes to one goal, Nibbana. Though there is nei-ther canonical nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained that satipatthana is called ektiyana magga, the direct pa th, to distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that proceeds through the jhanas or brahmavihtiras. While the latter can lead to Nibbana, they dp not do so necessarily but can lead to sidetracks, whereas satipatthana leads invariably to the final goal. 136 The word satipatthlina is a compound term. The first part, sati, originally meant \"memory,\" but in Pali Buddhist usage it far more frequently bears the meaning of atte~­tiveness directed to the present -hence the makeshIft rendering \"mindfulness.\" The second part is explained in two ways: either as a shortened form of upat!hana, mean-ing \"setting up\" or \"establishing\" - here, of mindfulness; or as patthana, meaning \"domain\" or \"foundation\" -again, of mindfulness. Thus the four satipatthanas may be understood as either the four ways of setting up mindful-ness or as the four objective domains of mindfulness, to be amplified in the rest of the sutta. The former seems to be the etymologically correct derivation (confirmed by Notes to Sutta 10 1189 the Sanskrit sm. tyupasthana), but the Pali commentators, while admitting both explanations, have a predilection for the latter. 137 MA says that in this context, \"bhikkhu\" is a term indicat-ing a person who earnestly endeavours to accomplish the practice of the teaChing: \"Whoever undertakes that prac-tice .. .is here comprised under the term 'bhikkhu.'\" 138 The repetition in the phrase \"contemplating the body as a body\" (ktiye ktiyanupassf), according to MA, has the pur-pose of precisely determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that object from others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice, the body ~hould be contemplated as such, and not one's feelings, Ideas, and emotions concerning it. The phrase also means that the body should be contemplated simply as a body and not as a man, a woman, a self, or a living being. Similar considerations apply to the repetitions in the case of each of the other three foundations of mindfulness. \"Covetousness and grief,\" MA says, stands for sensual desire and ill will, the principal hindrances that must be overcome for the practice to succeed, enumerated sepa-rately below in §36. 139 The structure of this sutta is fairly simple. Following the preamble, the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of the four foundations of mindfulness: 1. Contemplation of the body, which comprises fourteen exercises: mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the four postures; full awareness; attention to foulness; attention to the elements; and nine \"char-nel ground contemplations\" - reflection on corpses in different stages of decomposition. . II. Contemplation of feeling, considered one exercise. ill. Contemplation of mind, also one exercise. IV.Contemplation of mind-objects, which has five subdivi-sions - the five hindrances; the five aggregates; the six sense bases; the seven enlightenment factors; and the Four Noble Truths. Thus the sutta expounds altogether twenty-one exer-cises in contemplation. Each exercise in turn has two aspects: the basic exercise, explained first, and a supple-"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"1190 The Majjhima Nikaya 140 141 142 mentary section on insight (essentially the same for all the exercises), which indicates how the contemplation is to be developed to deepen understanding of the phe-nomenon under investigation. Finally the sutta concludes with a statement of assur-ance in which the Buddha personally vouches for the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of con-tinuous practice to be either arahantship or non-returning: The practice of mindfulness of breathing (iiniipiinasatl) involves no deliberate attempt to regulate the breath, as in hatha yoga, but a sustained effort to fix awareness on the breath as it moves in and out in its natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at the nostrils or the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt most distinctly; the length of the breath is noted but not consciously con-trolled. The complete development of this meditation method is expounded in MN 118. For an orga:used col-lection of texts on this subject, see Bhikkhu Na1).amoli, Mindfulness of Breathing. See too Vsm VIll, 145-244. MA: The phrase\" experiencing the whole body\" (sabba-kayapatisamvedI) means that the meditator becomes awa.re of each in-and-out breath through the three phases of Its beginning, middle, and end. The \"bodily formation\" (kiiyasankhiira) is defined at MN 44.13 as in-and-out breathing itself. Thus, as MA explains, with the'successful developn:ent of ~e pract~ce, the meditator's breathing becomes IncreasIngly qUIet, tranquil, and peaceful. .. . . 143 MA: \"Internally\": contemplating the breathIng In hIS own body. \"Externally\": contemplating the breathing 144 occurring in the body of another. \"Internally and exter-nally\": contemplating the breathing in his own body and in the body of another alternately, with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to the refrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under the contemplation of feeling, mind, and mind-objects, ~he contemplation externally, apart from those possessmg telepathic powers, must be inferential. MA: The\" arising factors\" (samudayadhammii) for the body are the conditions on account of which the body 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 Notes to Sutta 10 1191 has arisen -namely, ignorance, craving, kamma, and food - together with the concrete fact of the moment-by-moment origination of material phenomena in the body. In the case of mindfulness of breathing, an additional arising factor mentioned by the commentaries is the physiological apparatus of respiration. The \"vanishing factors\" (vayadhammii) for the body are the cessation of the causal conditions and the momentary dissolution of material phenomena in the body. MA: For the sake of a wider and wider and higher and higher measure of knowledge and mindfulness. The understanding of the bodily postures referred to in this exercise is not our ordinary natural knowledge of our bodily activity, but a close, constant, and careful awareness of the body in every position, coupled with an analytical examination intended to dispel the delusion of a self as the agent of bodily movement. Sampajanna, also translated as \"clear comprehension\" (Soma, Nyanaponika), is analysed in the commentaries into four types: full awareness of the purpose of one's action; full awareness of the suitability of one's means; full awareness of the domain, that is, not abandoning the sub-ject of meditation during one's daily routine; and full awareness of reality, the knowledge that behind one's activities there is no abiding self. See The Way of Mindful-ness, pp. 60-100; The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, pp. 46-55. In later Pali works the brain is added to the above list to form thirty-two parts. The details of this meditation prac-tice are explained at Vsm VIII, 42-144. These four elements are explained by Buddhist tradition as the primary attributes of matter - solidity, cohesion, heat, and distension. The detailed explanation is found at Vsm XI, 27-117. The phrase \"as though\" (seyyathiipi) suggests that this meditation, and those to follow, need not be based upon an ac~ual encounter with a corpse in the state of decay descnbed, but can be performed as an imaginative exer-cise. \"This same body\" is, of course, the meditator's own body. Each of the four types of corpse mentioned here, and the"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"1192 The Majjhima Niktiya 152 153 154 155 156 three types below, may be taken as a separate and self-sufficient subject of meditation; or the entire set may be used as a progressive series for impressing on the mind the idea of the body's transience and insubstantiality. The progression continues in §§26-30. Feeling (vedanli) signifies the affective quality of experi-ence, bodily and mental, either pleasant, painful, or nei-ther, i.e., neutral feeling. Examples of the \"worldly\" and \"unworldly\" forms of these feelings are given at MN 137.9-15 under the rubric of the six kinds of joy, grief, and equanimity based respectively on the house-hold life and renunciation. The arising and vanishing factors for feeling are the same as those for the body (see n.144) except that food is replaced by contact, since contact is the condition for feeling (see MN 9.42). . Mind (ciUa) as an object of contemplation refers to the gen-eral state and level of consciousness. Since consciousness itself, in its own nature, is the bare knowing or cognizing of an object, the quality of any state of mind is determined by its associated mental factors, such as lust, hate, and delusion or their opposites, as mentioned by the sutta. The paired examples of citta given in this passage contrast states of mind of wholesome and unwholesome, or devel-oped and undeveloped character. An ~xception, however, is the pair \"contracted\" and \"distracted,\" which are both unwholesome, the former due to sloth and torpor, the lat-ter due to restlessness and remorse. MA explains \"exalted mind\" and \"unsurpassed mind\" as the mind pertaining to the level of the jhanas and immaterial meditative attain-ments, and \"unexalted mind\" and \"surpassed mind\" as the mind pertaining to the level of sense-sphere conscio.us-ness. \"Liberated mind\" must be understood as a mmd temporarily and partly freed from defilements through insight or the jhanas. Since the practice of sati~atthiina pertains to the preliminary phase of the path aImed at the supramundane paths of deliverance, this last catego-ry should not be understood as a mind liberated through attainment of the supramundane paths. The arising and vanishing factors of mind are the same 157 158 159 160 161 Notes to Sutta 10 1193 as those for the body except that food is replaced by mentality-materiality, since the latter is the condition for consciousness (see DN 15.22/ii.63). The word rendered here as \"mind-objects\" is the poly-morphous dhammii. In this context dhammll can be under-stood as comprising all phenomena classified by way of the categories of the Dhamma, the Buddha's teaching of actuality. This contemplation reaches its climax in the penetration of the teaching at the heart of the Dhamma -the Four Noble Truths. The five hindrances (paficanzVara1Jll) are the main inner impediments to the development of concentration and insight. Sensual desire arises through attending unwisely to a sensually attractive object and is abandoned by med-itation on a foul object (as in §1O and §§14-30); ill will arises through attending unwisely to a repugnant object and is abandoned by developing loving-kindness; sloth and torpor arise by submitting to boredom and laziness and are abandoned by arousing energy; restlessness and remorse arise through unwisely reflecting on disturbing thoughts and are abandoned by wisely reflecting on tran-quillity; doubt arises through unwisely reflecting on dubious matters and is abandoned by study, investiga-tion, and inquiry. The hindrances are fully eradicated only by the supramundane paths. For a fuller treatment, see The Way of Mindfulness, pp. 119-130; Nyanaponika Thera, The Five Mental Hindrances; and also below, MN 27.18 and MN 39.13-14. The five aggregates affected by clinging (pafic'uplldllna-kkhandhii) are the five groups of factors comprising the individual personality. The aggregates are discussed in the Introduction, p. 26, and are analysed and explained in terms of their origin and disappearance at MN 109.9. The internal bases are, as shown, the six sense faculties; the external bases, their respective objects. The fetter that arises dependent upon the pairs may be understood by way of the ten fetters explained in the Introduction, pp. 42-43, or more simply as attraction (greed), aversion (hatred), and the underlying delusion.

The longer Mahtisatipatthana Sutta of the Dlgha Nikaya gives extend-ed definitions and elaborations of each of the truths. 165 Final knowledge, anna, is the arahant's knowledge of final deliverance. Non-return (anagamita) is, of course, the state of a non-returner, who is reborn in a higher world where he attains final Nibbana without ever returning to the human world. SurrA 11 166 The phrase \"only here\" means only in the Buddha's Dispensation. The four recluses (san:a1Ja) referred to are the four grad~s of noble disciples -the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and arahant. A \"lion's roar\" (slhanada), according to MA, is a roar of supremacy and fearlessness, a roar that cannot be confuted. In connec-tion with the Buddha's proclamation, see also his discus-sion with Subhadda in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta (DN 16:5.27/ii.151-52). 167 MA: Even though the adherents of other sects all declare arahantship -understood in a general way as spiritual perfection - to be the goal, they point out other attain-ments as the goal in accordance with their views. Thus the brahmins declare the Brahma-world to be the goal, the ascetics declare the gods of Streaming Radiance, the wanderers the gods of Refulgent Glory, and the Ajlvakas the non-percipient state, which they imagine to be \"infi-nite mind.\" 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 Notes to Sutta 11 1195 \"Favouring and opposing\" (anurodhapa#virodha) means reacting with attraction through lust and with aversion through hate. . Proliferation (papanca), according to MA, is here mental activity governed by craving and views. For more on this important term, see n.229. The view of being (bhavaditthi) is eternalism, the belief in an eternal self; the view of non-being (vibhavaditthi) is annihilationism, the denial of any principle of continuity as a basis for rebirth and kammic retribution. The adop-tion of one view entailing opposition to the other ties up with the earlier statement that the goal is for one who does not favour and oppose. As the origin (samudaya) of these views, MA mentions eight conditions: the five aggregates, ignorance, contact, perception, thought, unwise attention, bad friends, and the voice of another. Their disappearance (atthangama) is the path of stream-entry, which eradicates all wrong views. Their gratification (assada) may be understood as the satisfaction of psychological need that they provide; their danger (adlnava) is the continual bondage that they entail; the escape (nissarm:za) from them is Nibbana. MA glosses full understanding (parinna) here as over-coming, transcending (samatikkama), with reference to the commentarial notion of pahanaparinna, \"full understand-ing as abandonment.\" See n.7. This passage clearly states that the critical factor differen-tiating the Buddha's teaching from all other religious and philosophical creeds is its \"full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self.\" This means, in effect, that the Buddha alone is able to show how to overcome all vi'ews of self by developing penetration of the truth of non-self. Since the other spiritual teachers lack this understanding of non-self, their claims to fully understand the three other kinds of clinging are also suspect. MA: That is, the Buddha teaches how clinging to sense pleasures (understood as comprising all forms of greed, MT) is abandoned by the path of arahantship, the other three clingings by the path of stream-entry. This passage is stated to show how clinging is to be aban-"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"1196 The Majjhirna Nikliya doned. Clinging is traced back to its root-cause in igno-rance, and then the destruction of ignorance is shown to be the means to eradicate clinging. 176 The Pali idiom, n' eva kamupadlinam upadiyati, would have to be rendered literally as \"he does not cling to the clinging ,to sense pleasures,\" which may obscure the sense rather than convey it. Upadlina in Pali is the object of its own verb form, while \"clinging\" in English is not. At one stage in his translation Nm tried to circumvent this problem by borrowing the word uplidana's other meaning of \"fuel\" and translating: \"he no longer clings to sensual desires [as fuel for] clinging.\" This, however, also border~ on obscurity, and I have therefore attempted to cut through the difficulty by translating directly in accordance with the sense rather than in conformity with the literal idiom. SUITA 12 177 The Sunakkhatta Sutta (MN 105) had been expounded to him by the Buddha, apparently before he joined the Sangha; the account of his defection is given in the Patika Sutta (DN 24). He became dissatisfied and left the Order because the Buddha would not perform any miracles for him or explain to him the beginning of things. 178 Superhuman states (uttari manussadhammli) are states, virtues, orattamments higher than the ordinary human virtues comprised in the ten wholesome courses of action (see MN 9.6); they include the jhanas, the kinds of direct knowledge, and the paths and fruIts. \"Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\" (alam-ariyafili1J.adassanavisesa), a frequently occurring expression in the suttas, signifies all higher degrees of meditative knowledge characteristic of the noble individual. Here, according to MA, it means specifically the supramun-dane path, which Sunakl<hatta is denying of the Buddha. 179 The gist of his criticism is that the Buddha teaches a doc-trine that he has merely worked out in thought rather than one he has realised through transcendental wisdom. Apparently he believes that being led to the complete destruction of suffering is, as a goal, inferior to the acqui-Notes to Sutta 12 1197 sition of miraculous powers. 180 All the sections to follow are set forth as a rebuttal of Sunakkhatta's criticism of the Buddha. §§6-8 cover the first three of the six direct know ledges (abhififi.li), the last three appearing as the last of the ten powers of the Tathagata. The l~tter, according to MA, are to be under-stood as powers of knowledge (fili1J.abala) that are attained by all Buddhas as the fruit of their accumulation of merit. The Vibhanga (§§809-31/440-51) of the Abhi-dhamma Pitaka provides an elaborate analysis of them. 181 On the Buddha's sounding of his lion's roar, see SN 22:78liii.84-86. The Wheel of Brahma is the supreme, best, most excellent wheel, the Wheel of the Dhamma (dhammacakka) in its twofold meaning: the knowledge penetrating the truth and the knowledge of how to expound the teaching (MA). 182 Vbh §809 explicates this knowledge by quoting at length MN 115.12-17. MA, however, explains it differently as the knowledge of the correlations between causes and their results. 183 This knowledge can be exemplified by the Buddha's analysis of kanuna in MN 57, MN 135 and MN 136. 184 This knowledge will be elucidated in §§35--42 below. 185 The Tathagata's understanding of the many elements constituting the world will be found in MN 115.4-9. 186 Vbh §813 explains that the Tathagata understands that beings are of inferior inclinations and superior inclina-tions, and that they gravitate towards those who share their own inclinations. 187 Vbh §§814-27 gives a detailed analysis. MA states the meaning more concisely as the Tathagata's knowledge'of the superiority and inferiority of beings' faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. 188 Vbh §828: The \"defilement\" (sankilesa) is a state causing deterioration, \"cleansing\" (vodlina) a state causing excellence, \"emergence\" (vutthlina) is both cleansing and the rising out of an attainment. The eight liberations (vimokkhii) are enumerated in MN 77.22 and MN 137.26; the nine attainments (samapatti) are the four jhanas, four immaterial attainments, and the cessation of perception"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"1198 The Majjhima Niktiya and feeling as in MN 25.12-20. 189 The idiom yathilbhatam nikkhitto evam niraye is knotty; the rendering here follows the commentary: \"He will be put in hell as if carried Off and put there by the wardens of hell.\" 190 In later Buddhist tradition the asuras, titans or \"anti-gods,\" are added as a separate realm to make six destinations. 191 Ekanta: may also mean \"exclusively\" or \"incessantly.\" 192 MA: Even though the deSCription is the same as that of the bliss of the heavenly world, the meaning is different. For the bliss of the heavenly world is not really extremely pleasant because the fevers of lust, etc., are still present there. But the bliss of Nibbana is extremely pleasant in every way through the subsiding of all fevers . . 193 At this juncture, MA informs us, the Buddha related this account of his past ascetic practices because Sunak-khatta was a great admirer of extreme asceticism (as the Ptl[ika Sutta shows) and the Buddha wanted to make it known that there was no one who could equal him in the practice of austerities. The passages to follow should be collated with MN 4.20 and MN 36.20-30 for a fuller pic-ture of the Bodhisatta's experiment with the extreme of self-mortification. 194 The \"eight-days interval of frost\" refers to a regular cold spell that occurs in northern India in late December or early January . • 195 That is, they hold the view that beings are purified by reducing their intake of food. 196 Rebirth into the Pure Abodes (suddhtlvasa) is possible only for non-returners. 197 The Pali for the four terms is: sati, gati, dhiti, pafifiaveyyat-tiya. MA explains sati as the ability to grasp in mind a hundred or a thousand phrases as they are being spoken; gati as the ability to bind them and retain them in the mind; dhiti as the ability to recite back what has been grasped and retained; and pafifiilveyyattiya as the ability to discern the meaning and logic of those phrases. 198 Ven.

SurrA 13 200 201 202 203 204 MA: \"Full understanding\" (parififia) here means overcom-ing (samatikkama) or abandoning (pahiina). The wanderers of other sects identify the full understanding of sensual pleas~res with the first jhana, the full understanding of matenal form with the immaterial planes of being, and the full un~erstanding of feelings with the impercipient plane of bemg. The Buddha, in contrast, describes the full understanding of sensual pleasures as the path of the non-returner, and the full understanding of both material form ~nd feelings as the path of arahantship. MA gIves a graphic description of each of these forms of torture. It should be noted that while the previous dangers in sensual pleasures were called \"a mass of suffering visible here and now\" (sanditfhiko dukkhakkhandho), this one is called \"a mass of suffering in the life to come\" (samparliyiko dukkhakkhandho ). MA says that Nibbana is the removal and abandonment of desire an~ lust for sensual pleasures, for in depen-dence on Nlbbana, desire and lust are removed and abandoned. It might also be taken to include the path of the non-returner, which accomplishes the abandoning of desire and lust for sensual pleasures. To expose the danger in feelings, the Buddha chooses the m?st refined and exalted type of mundane pleasure, the bhss and peacefulness of the jhanas, and shows that even those states are impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory. SurrA 14 205 Mahanama the Sakyan was a cousin of the Buddha and the brother of Vens. Anuruddha and Ananda. He chose to remain a householder and let Anuruddha become a monk. The story is told in NaDamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 80-81."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"1200 The Majjhima Nik11ya 206 According to MA, Mahanama had long ago attained the fruit of the once-returner, which only weakens greed, hate, and delusion but does not eradicate them. MA says that he had the mistaken notion that greed, hate, and delusion are eradicated by the path of the once-returner. Thus, when he saw that they still arose in his mind, he realised that they were not abandoned and inquired from the Buddha the cause for their arising. Noble disciples can be mistaken about which defilements are abandoned by which path. 207 From the ensuing discussion on the danger in sensual pleasures, it seems that the \"state\" (dhamma) unabandoned by Mahanama was sensual desire, which kept him tied to the home life and the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. 208 The \"rapture and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures\" are the rapture and pleasure pertaining to the first and second jhanas; the states \"more peaceful than that\" are the higher jhanas. From this passage it seems that a disciple may attain even to the second path and fruit without possessing mundane jhana. 209 The Nigat:lthas or Jains, followers of the teacher NigaDtha Nataputta (also known as Mahavlra), stressed the prac-tice of austerities to wear off the accumulations of past evil kamma. The purpose of this passage, according to MA, is to show the escape, which was not shown earlier along with th~ gratification and the danger in sensual pleasures. The Buddha brings in the Jain practice of asceticism to demonstrate that his own teaching is a \"Middle Way\" free from the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification. 210 The Jains held the view that whatever a person experi-ences is caused by past kamma. If that were so, the Buddha argues, the severe pains to which they subjected themselves as part of their ascetic discipline would have to be rooted in grave actions of their previous lives. 211 MA: This refers to his own experience of the pleasure of fruition attainment, i.e., the attainment of the fruit of ara-hantship (arahattaphalasamllpatti). Notes to Suttas 14-16 1201 surrA 15 212 Vadantu, meaning literally \"let them speak to me,\" has the implied sense: \"Let them speak to me by way of instruction and exhortation\" (MA). 213 See MN 5.10-29. 214 See MN 8.44 and n.l09. 215 It is from this passage that the sutta acquires its name. 216 MA: The ancients called this sutta the \"Bhikkhupati-mokkha.\" A bhikkhu should review himself three times daily in the way described in the sutta. If he cannot do so three times, then he should do so twice, or, at the mini-mum, once. SurrA 16 217 218 219 220 221 MA explains cetokhila, translated \"wilderness in the heart,\" as rigidity, rubbish, or a stump in the mind. It explains cetaso vinibandha as something that binds the mind, clenching it like a fist; hence \"shackle in the heart.\" The former, as will be seen, consists of four cases of doubt, one of hate; the latter of five varieties of greed. MA explains \"Dhamma\" here as the scriptural teaching and penetration to the paths, fruits, and Nibbana. The Dhamma as practice is mentioned separately just below a~ the training (si~khi!) -that is, the threefold training in virtue, concentration, and wisdom. \"Body\" here is his own body, while \"form\" just below is outer forms, the bodies of others. The four bases for spiritual power (iddhipada) are included among the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment; they are the special foundation for the five mundane kinds of direct knowledge (abhiiiiiii). According to MA, enthusi-asm (usso{hi) is energy, which is to be applied every-where. The fifteen factors are the abandoning of the five wilder-nesses of the heart, the abandoning of the five shackles, and the five just mentioned. \"Supreme security from bondage\" (anuttara yogakkhema) is arahantship, as at MN 1.27. 222 This simile appears again at MN 53.19-22 in connection"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"1202 The Majjhima Nikaya with the disciple's breaking out to the three types of true knowledge (tevijja).

BBS and SBI eds. read apuccha, \"after taking leave,\" which seems more fitting. As the person on whom the bhikkhu relied -presumably a lay supporter -provided the requisites in adequate measure, courtesy requires that the bhikkhu take leave of him before departing. SurrA 18 226 Dar:t<;lapani, whose name means \"stick-in-hand,\" was so called because he used to walk around ostentatiously with a golde:p. walking stick, even though he was still young and healthy. According to MA, he sided with Devadatta, the Buddha's arch foe, when the latter attempted to create a schism in the Buddha's following. His manner of asking the question is arrogant and delib-erately provocative. 227 The first part of the Buddha's reply directly counters Dar:t<;lapani's aggressive attitude. MA quotes in this con-nection SN 22:94/iii.138: \"Bhikkhus, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that disputes with me. A speaker of Dhamma does not dispute with anyone in the world.\" The second part may be taken to mean that, for the arahant (spoken of here as \"that brahmin\" with refer-ence to the Buddha himself), perceptions no longer awaken the dormant underlying tendencies to defile-Notes to Sutta 18 1203 ments, to be enumerated in §8. 228 This response seems to be an expression of frustration and bewilderment. 229 The interp~etation of this cryptic passage hinges on the ~ord papanca and the compound papafzca-safzfza-sankha. Nm had translated the former as \"diversification\" and the. la~;r as \"calculations about perceptions of diversifi-cati.on. It seems, however, that the primary problem to WhICh the term papanca points is not \"diversification\" ~hich ma~ be ~uite in place when the sensory field its:lf ~Ispl~ys .dIVersIty, but the propensity of the worldling's unagmatIon to erupt in an effusion of mental commen-tary. that obscures the bare data of cognition.

Maha Kaccana was declared by the Buddha to be the most eminent disciple in expounding the detailed meaning of a brief saying. MN 133 and MN 138 were also spoken by him under similar circumstances. 231 Cakkhubhuto fialJabhuto dhammabhuto brahmabhuto. MA: He is vision in the sense that he is the leader in vision; he is knowledge in the sense that he makes things known; he is the Dhamma in the sense that he consists of the Dhamma that he utters verbally after considering it in his heart; he is Brahma, the holy one, in the sense of the best. 232 This passage shows how papafica, emerging from the process of cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and victimise their hapless crea-tor. Ms contains a note by Nm: \"The meeting of eye, form, and eye-consciousness is called contact. Contact, according to dependent origination, is the principal con-dition of feeling. Feeling and perception are inseparable (MN 43.9). What is perceived as 'this' is thought about in its differences and is thus diversified from 'that' and from 'me.' This diversification -involving craving for form, wrong view about permanence of form, etc., and the conceit 1 am' -leads to preoccupation with calculat-ing the desirability of past and present forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future.\" Perhaps the key to the interpretation of this passage is Yen. Maha Kaccana's explanation of the Bhaddekaratta verses in MN 133. There too delight in the elements of cognition plays a prominent role in causing bondage, and the elaboration of the verses in terms of the three periods of time links up with the reference to the three times in this sutta. 233 The Pali idiom phassapafifiattirfl pafifiapessati, in which !he verb takes an object derived from itself, is difficul~. Nrn originally rendered \"that one will describe a de:;pription of contact.\" \"To point out a manifestation\" is less literal, Notes to $uttas 18-20 1205 but it should do justice to the meaning without jeopardis-ing intelligibility. MA says that this passage is intended to show the entire round of existence (vatta) by way of the twelve sense bases; §18 shows the cessation of the round (vivatta) by the negation of the twelve sense bases. 234 A large sweet cake or a ball made from flour, ghee, molasses, honey, sugar, etc. See also AN 5:194/iii.237. SUTIA 19 235 The Bodhisatta's twofold division of thought occurred during his six-year struggle for enlightenment. 236 Thoughts of non-ill will and thoughts of non-cruelty may also be explained positively as thoughts of loving-kindness (metta) and thoughts of compassion (karulJa). 237 MA: Excessive thinking and pondering leads to agitation. To tame and soften the mind, the Bodhisatta would enter a meditative attainment, then he would emerge from it and develop insight. SUTTA20 238 This sutta together with its commentary is available in a translation by Soma Thera, The Removal of Distracting Thoughts. 239 MA: The higher mind (adhicitta) is the mind of the eight meditative attainments used as a basis for insight; it is called \"higher mind\" because it is higher than the ordi-nary (wholesome) mind of the ten wholesome courses of action. The five \"signs\" (nimitta) may be understood as practical methods of removing the distracting thoughts. They should be resorted to only when the distractions become persistent or obtrusive; at other times the medita-tor should remain with his primary subject of meditation. 240 MA: When thoughts of sensual desire arise directed towards living beings, the \"other sign\" is the meditation on foulness (see MN 10.10); when the thoughts are direct-ed to inanimate things, the \"other sign\" is attention to impermanence.

The remedy for thoughts connected with delusion is living under a teacher, studying the Dhamma, inquiring into its meaning, listening to the Dhamma, and inquiring into causes. 241 This method can be illustrated by the reflections of the Bodhisatta in MN 19.3-5. Calling to mind the unworthi-ness of the evil thoughts produces a sense of shame (hiri); calling to mind their dangerous consequences produces fear of wrongdoing (ottappa). 242 Vitakka-sankhara-sa1fthanam. MA understands sankhara here as condition, cause, or root, and takes the com-pound to mean \"stopping the cause of the thought.\" This is accomplished by inquiring, when an unwholesome thought has arisen: \"What is its cause? What is the cause of its cause?\" etc. Such an inquiry, according to MA, brings about a slackening, and eventually the cessation, of the flow of unwholesome thought. 243 MA: He should crush the unwholesome state of mind with a wholesome state of mind. 244 This shows the attainment of arahantship. See n.50. SUTIA 21 245 At SN 12:12/ii.13 Moliya Phagguna puts a series of ques-tions to the Buddha, which the Buddha rejects as wrong-ly formulated. Later it is reported that he reverted to lay life (SN 12:32/ii.50). 246 According to MA, the Buddha said this because Phagguna still did not wish to comply with his advice but continued to resist him, and this induced the Buddha to speak praise of the compliant bhikkhus during an earlier part of his ministry. For the passage on eating at a single session, see MN 65.2 and MN 70.2. 247 Tadarammar:zam, lit. \"with him as the object.\" MA: First one develops loving-kindness towards the person who addresses one with one or another of the five courses of Notes to Suttas 21 and 22 1207 speech, then one directs that mind of loving-kindness towards all beings, making the entire world the object. SUTIA 22 248 This sutta with a fine introduction and detailed notes is available in a translation by Nyanaponika Thera, The Discourse on the Snake Simile. 249 In making this assertion he directly contradicts the third of the four intrepidities of the Tathagata - see MN 12.25. According to MA, while reflecting in seclusion he came to the conclusion that there would be no harm if bhikkhus were to engage in sexual relations with women and he maintained that this should not be prohibited by the monastic rules. Though his statement does not expressly mention the sexual issue, the similes about sen-sual pleasures brought forth by the bhikkhus lend cre-dence to the commentary. 250 The first seven similes for sense pleasures are expanded upon at MN 54.15-2l. 251 This first part of the Arittha episode occurs twice in the Vinaya Pitaka. At Yin ii.25 it leads to the Sangha announcing an act of suspension (ukkhepaniyakamma) against Arittha for refUSing to give up his wrong view. At Yin iv.133-34 his refusal to give up his wrong view after repeated admonitions is defined as a monastic offence of the Pacittiya class. 252 Though the Pali uses the one word klima in all four cases, from the context the first phrase must be understood to refer to .objective sensual pleasures, i.e., sensually enjoy-able objects, the other phrases to refer to subjective defilements connected with sensuality, i.e., sensual desire. MA glosses \"that one can engage in sensual plea-sures\" with \"that one can indulge in sexual intercourse.\" MT says that other physical acts expressive of sexual desire such as hugging and stroking should be included."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"1208 The Majjhima Nikiiya 253 MA explains that this passage is stated in order to show the fault in wrongly motivated acquisition of intellectual knowledge of the Dhanuna - apparently the pitfall into which AriHha fell. The \"good (attha) for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma\" is the paths and fruits. 254 This famous \"simile of the raft\" continues the same argu-ment against misuse of learning introduced by the simile of the snake. One who is preoccupied with using the Dhamma to stir up controversy and win debates carries the Dhamma around on his head instead of using it to cross the flood. 255 Dhamma pi va pahlitabbll pageva adhamma. MA identifies the good states with serenity and insight (samatha-vipassanil), and paraphrases the meaning: \"I teach, bhikkhus, even the abandoning of desire and attachment to such peace-ful and sublime states as serenity and insight, how much more so to that low, vulgar, contemptible, coarse, and impure thing that this foolish Arittha sees as harmless when he says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure.\" The commen-tator cites MN 66.26-33 as an example of the Buddha teaching the abandonment of attachment to serenity, MN 38.14 as an example of his teaching the abandon-ment of attachment to insight. Note that it is in each case the attachment to the good states that'should be aban-doned, not the good states themselves. The Buddha's injunction is not an invitation to moral nihilism or a pro-posal that the enlightened person has gone beyond good and evil. In this connection see MN 76.5l. 256 This section evidently has the purpose of forestalling another type of misconception and misrepresentation of the Dhamma, i.e., the introduction of a view of self into the teaching. According to MA, standpoints for views (ditthitthlina) are wrong views themselves as grounds for other more elaborate wrong views; the objects of views, i.e., the five aggregates; and the conditions for views, i.e., such factors as ignorance, perverted perception, and false thoughts, etc. 257 MA states that the notion \"this is mine\" is induced by craving, the notion \"this I am\" by conceit, and the notion Notes to Sutta 22 1209 \"this is my self\" by wrong views. These three - craving, conceit, and views -are called the three obsessions (gaha). They are also the mainsprings behind conceiving (MN 1) and mental proliferation (MN 18). 258 This series of terms shows the aggregate of consciousness indirectly, by way of its object. The \"seen\" points to eye-consciousness, the \"heard\" to ear-consciousness, the \"sensed\" to the other three kinds of sense consciousness, and the remaining terms to mind -consciousness. 259 This is a full-fledged eternalist view arisen on the basis of one of the earlier, more rudimentary types of personality view; here it becomes itself an object of craving, conceit, and the false view of self. Yen. Nyanaponika contends that this view expresses the identity of the self with the universe, though this interpretation is purely hypotheti-cal as the Pali is ambiguous and could just as well be pointing to a fundamental dualism of self and world along the lines of Sankhya philosophy with its distinction between changeable Nature (prak, ti) and changeless Spirit (puru\"a) 260 Asati na paritassati. The noun form paritassana, according to MA, has the twofold connotation of fear and craving, thus \"agitation\" was chosen as comprehending both. Agitation about what is non-existent external1y (§18) refers to the worldling's despair over the loss or non-acquisition of possessions; agitation about what is non-existent internal1y (§20) to the eternalist's despair when he misinterprets the Buddha's teaching on Nibbana as a doctrine of annihilation. 261 Pariggahariz pariga1Jheyyiitha, lit. \"you may possess that possession.\" This links up with §18 on agitation about' external possessions. 262 Attavi1dupadanariz upadiyetha, lit. \"you may cling to that clinging to a doctrine of self.\" On the problem this idiom involves for translation, see n.176. This passage links up with §20 on agitation arising from a view of self. 263 The support of views (diUhinissaya), according to MA, is the sixty-two views mentioned in the Brahmajala Sutta (DN I), which emerge from personality view or \"doc-trine of a self.\" It might also include the pernicious view"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"1210 The Majjhima Nikliya adopted by Arittha at the begirirung of the sutta. 264 The notion \"what belongs to self\" or \"self's property\" (attaniya) is ascribed to whichever among the five aggre-gates are not identified as self, as well as to all the indi-vidual's external possessions. This passage shows the mutual dependence, and thus the equal untenability, of the twin notions \"I\" and \"mine.\" 265 According to the commentaries, disenchantment (nibbidli, also rendered \"revulsion\" or \"disgust\") signifies the cul-minating stages of insight, dispassion (virliga) the attain-ment of the supramundane path, and liberation (vimutti) the fruit. The arahant's reviewing knowledge (pacca-vekkha7;lafili7;la) is shown by the phrase \"there comes the knowledge\" and \"he understands: 'Birth is destroyed . . . '.\" 266 \"Thus gone\" is, in Pali, tathligata, the usual epithet of the Buddha, but here applied more broadly to the arahant. MA interprets this passage in two alternative ways thus: (1) The arahant even while alive is here and now untrace-able as a being or individual (in the sense of an abiding self) because in the ultimate sense there is no being (as self). (2) The arahant is untraceable here and now because it is impossible for the gods, etc., to find the sup-port for his insight-mind, path-mind, or fruition-mind (vipassanlicitta, maggacitta, phaZacitta); that is, the object being Nibbana, his mind cannot. be known by the worldling. 267 This refers back to §20, where the eternalist misunder-stands the Buddha's teaching on Nibbana, the cessation of being, to involve the annihilation of an existing being considered as self. 268 The import of this statement is deeper than appears on the surface. In the context of the false accusations of §37, the Buddha is stating that he teaches that a living being is not a self but a mere conglomeration of factors, mater-ial and mental events, linked together in a process that is inherently dukkha, and that Nibbana, the cessation of suf-fering, is not the annihilation of a being but the termina-tion of that same unsatisfactory process. This statement should be read in conjunction with SN 12:15/ii.17, where the Buddha says that one with right view, who Notes to Sutta 22 1211 has discarded all doctrines of a self, sees that whatever arises is only dukkha arising, and whatever ceases is only dukkha ceasing. . 269 \"What had earlier come to be fully understood\" (pubbe parififilitani) are the five aggregates. Since it is only these to which honour and abuse are shown, not an \"I\" or self, there is no reason for elation or dejection. 270 MA points out that it is the attachment to the five aggre-gates that should be abandoned; the aggregates them-selves cannot be tom apart or pulled out. 271 MA: \"Chinna-pilotika: pilotikii is a tom and worn-out rag stitched and knotted here and there; there is nothing (in the Dhamma) like this -torn, worn-out, stitched and knotted by way of hypocrisy and other deceptions.\" 272 That is, as the arahants have achieved deliverance from the entire round of existence, it is impossible to point to any plane within the round where they might be reborn. 273 These are two classes of individuals standing on the path of stream-entry. \"Dhamma-followers\" (dhammiinuslirin) are disciples in whom the faculty of wisdom (pafifiindriya) is predominant and who develop the noble path with wisdom in the lead; when they attain the fruit they are called\" attained-to-view\" (ditthipatta). \"Faith-followers\" (saddhiinusiirin) are disciples in whom the faculty of faith (saddhindriya) is predominant and who develop the noble path with faith in the lead; when they attain the fruit they are called \"liberated -by-faith\" (saddhlivimutta). See MN 70.20, 21; also Pug 1:35-36/15 and Vsm XXI, 75. 274 MA says that this refers to persons devoted to the prac-tice of insight meditation who have not reached any supramundane attainment. Note that they are headed only for heaven, not for enlightenment, though if their practice matures they can attain the path of stream-entry and thus gain assurance of enlightenment. The expres-sion saddhamattani pemamattani might be rendered \"sim-ply faith, simply love\" or \"mere faith, mere love\" (as it sometimes is), but this could not explain the guarantee of rebirth in heaven. It therefore seems obligatory to take the suffix matta here as implying a requisite amount of faith and love, not simple possession of these qualities."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"1212 The Majjhima Nikiiya SUITA 23 275 Yen. Kumara Kassapa was an adopted son of King Pasenadi of Kosala, born of a woman who, not knowing she was pregnant, had gone forth as a bhikkhunI after having conceived him. At the time this sutta was deliv-ered he was still a sekha; he attained arahantship uSing this sutta as his subject of meditation. 276 According to MA, this deity was a non-returner living in the Pure Abodes. He and Kumara Kassapa had been members of a group of five fellow monks who, in the Dispensation of the previous Buddha Kassapa, had prac-tised meditation together on a mountain-top. It was this same deity who spurred Bahiya Daruciriya, another for-mer member of the group, to visit the Buddha (see Ud 1:1O/7). 277 The meaning of the deities' imagery will be explained later on in the sutta itself. 278 Kummilsa: The Vinaya and commentaries explain it as something made of yava, barley. Nm had translated the word as bread, but from MN 82.18 it is clear that kum-milsa is viscous and spoils overnight. PED defines it as junket; Homer translates as \"sour milk.\" 279 MA: Just as a bar across the entrance to a city prevents people from entering it, so ignorance prevents people from attaining t:Jibbana. . 280 Dvedhilpatha might also have been rendered \"a forked path,\" an obvious symbol for doubt. 281 MA states that the four feet and head of a tortoise are similar to the five aggregates. 282 MA: the axe and block (asisflna, at MN 22.3 rendered \"slaughterhouse\") are used for chopping meat. Similarly, beings desiring sensual enjoyments are chopped up by the axe of sensual desires upon the biock of sense objects. 283 The symbolism is explicated at MN 54.16. 284 This is an arahant. For the symbolism, see n.75. SUTIA 24 285 The parenthetical specification is supplied from MA. The Buddha's native land is Kapilavatthu, at the foot of the Notes to Sutta 24 1213 Himalayas. 286 The last five items form a set called the five aggregates of Dhamma (dhammakkhandha). \"Deliverance\" is identified with the noble fruits, \"the knowledge and vision of deliv-erance\" with reviewing knowledge. 287 Yen. PUWa Mantar:tiputta belonged to a brahmin family and was ordained by Yen. Anna Kondanna at Kapila-vatthu, where he continued to reside until he decided to visit the Buddha at SavatthI. He was later declared by the Buddha the most eminent bhikkhu among the preachers of the Dhamma. 288 Although these seven purifications (satta visuddhi) are mentioned elsewhere in the Pali Canon (at DN iii.288, with two added: purification by wisdom and purification by deliverance), it is curious that they are not analysed as a set anywhere in the Nikayas; and this becomes even more puzzling when both these great disciples seem to recognise them as a fixed group of doctrinal categories. The sevenfold scheme forms, however, the scaffolding for the entire Visuddhimagga, which defines the different stages by means of the fully developed commentarial tra-ditions on concentration and insight meditation. In brief, \"purification of virtue\" (srlavisuddhi) is the unbroken adherence to the moral precepts one has undertaken, explained by Vsm with reference to the moral training of a bhikkhu as the \"fourfold purification of virtue.\" \"Purification of mind\" (cittavisuddhi) is the overcoming of the five hindrances through the attain-ment of access concentration and the jhanas. \"Purifi-_ .. cation of view\" (diUhivisuddhi) is the understanding that defines the nature of the five aggregates constituting 'a living being. \"Purification by overcoming doubt\" (kankhavitaralJavisuddhi) is the understanding of condi-tionality. \"Purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path\" (maggamaggafiaIJa-dassanavisuddhi) is the correct discrimination between the false path of the ecstatic, exhilarating experiences and the true path of insight into impermanence, suffering, and not self. \"Purification by knowledge and vision of the way\" (patipadafialJadassanavisuddhi) comprises the ascend-ing series of insight knowledges up to the supramundane"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"1214 The Majjhima Niktiya paths. And \"purification by knowledge and vision\" (fiiiIJadassanavisuddhi) is the supramundane paths. 289 MA glosses anupadanaparinibbana as appaccayaparinibbana, \"final Nibbana that has no condition,\" explaining that upadilna has two meanings: grasping (gahaIJa), as in the usual passage on the four types of clinging; and condi-tion (paccaya), as illustrated by this passage. The com-mentators explain \"final Nibbana without clinging\" either as the fruit of arahantship, because it cannot be grasped by any of the four types of clinging; or as Nibbana the unconditioned, because it has not arisen through any condition. 290 MA explains that the first six stages are \"accompanied by clinging\" in the sense both of being conditioned and of existing in one who still has grasping; the seventh stage, being supramundane, only in the sense of being conditioned. 291 MA says that Sariputta asked this only as a way of greet-ing PUJ).l)a Mantfu).iputta since he already knew his name. PUJ).l)a, however, had never seen Sariputta before and so must have been genuinely surprised to meet the great disciple. 292 Satthukappa. MA says that this is the highest praise that can be spoken of a disciple. SUTTA 25 293 Cetovimutti: MA explains that they simply abandoned their resolution to live in the wilds, though it could well be that these ascetics had attained -and lost -the eight meditative attainments that are usually implied by the term cetovimutti. 294 These are the ten speculative views debated by the ascetic philosophers of the Buddha's age. All were rejected by the Buddha as being unconnected with the fundamentals of the holy life and unconducive to liberation from suffer-ing. See MN 63, MN 72. 295 The eight meditative attainments here must be under-stood, as MA explains, as bases for insight. When a bhikkhu has entered such a jhana, Mara cannot see how 296 Notes to Suttas 25 and 26 1215 ~is mind is proceeding. This immunity from Mara's mfluence, however, is as yet only temporary. This last bhikkhu, by destroying the taints, has become ~ot only' tempor~rily invisible to Mara but permanently maccessible to hIm. On the cessation of perception and feeling, see Introduction, p . 41. SUTTA 26 297 This title follows the PTS and SBJ eds. of MN. The BBS ed. of MN, and both the PTS and BBS eds. of MA, refer to this discourse as the Pilsartisi Sutta, The Heap of Snares, with reference to the simile in §§32-33. 298 MA points out that the second jhana and one's basic meditation subject are both called \"noble silence\" (ariyo tUIJhlbhtivo). Those who cannot attain the second jhana are advised to maintain noble silence by attending to their basic meditation subject. 299 Upadhi: The root meaning is foundation, basis, ground (PED). In the commentaries various kinds of upadhi are enumerated, among them the five aggregates, objects of sensual pleasure, defilements, and kamma. Nm renders the term consistently throughout as \"essentials of exis-tence,\" which often obscures its clear contextual mean-ing. I have tried to capture the several connotations of the word by rendering it \"objects of attachment\" where its objective meaning is prominent (as it is here) and as \"attachment\" where its subjective meaning is prominent. At MN 26.19 Nibbana is called \"the relinquishing of all attachments\" (sabb'upadhipa#nissagga), with both mean-ings intended. 300 ~old and silver are excluded from the things subject to SIckness, death, and sorrow, but they are subject to defilement, according to MA, because they can be alloyed with metals of lesser worth. 301 MA: He taught' him the seven attainments (of serenity meditation) ending in the base of nothingness, the third of the four immaterial attainments. Though these attain-ments are spiritually exalted, they are still mundane and not in themselves directly conducive to Nibbana."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"1216 The Majjhima Nikaya 302 That is, it leads to rebirth in the plane of existence called the base of nothingness, the objective counterpart of the seventh meditative attainment. Here the lifespan is sup-posed to be 60,000 aeons, but when that has elapsed one must pass away and return to a lower world. Thus one who attains this is still not free from birth and death but is caught in the trap of Mara (MA). Horner misses the point that rebirth is the issue by translating \"only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing\" (MLS 1:209). 303 Both Horner in MLS and Nm in Ms err in their transla-tions of the account of the Bodhisatta's meeting with Uddaka Ramaputta by assuming that Uddaka is identical with Rama. However, as his name indicates, Uddaka was the son (putta) of Rama, either biological or spiritual. Rama himself must have already passed away before the Bodhisatta arrived on the scene. It should be noted that all references to Rama are in the past tense and the third person, and that Uddaka in the end places the Bodhisatta in the position of teacher. Though the text does not allow for definite conclusions, this suggests that he himself had not yet reached the fourth immaterial attainment. 304 MN 36, which includes the account of the Bodhisatta's meetings with Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, continues from this point with the story of the extreme ascetic practices that brought him to the verge of death and of his subsequent discovery of the Middle Way that led to enlightenment. 305 MA identifies \"this Dhamma\" with the Four Noble Truths. The two truths or states (thana) spoken of just below -dependent origination and Nibbana -are the truths of the origin of suffering and the cessation of suf-fering, which respectively imply the truths of suffering and the path. 306 Alaya. It is difficult to find for this word a suitable English equivalent that has not already been assigned to a more frequently occurring Pali term. Horner renders it as \"sensual pleasure,\" which appropriates the usual ren-dering of kama and may be too narrow. In Ms and in other published works Nm translates it as \"something to rely on,\" which may draw upon a connotation of the Notes to Sutta 26 1217 word that is not the one intended here. MA explains alaya as comprising both objective sense pleasures and the thoughts of craving concerned with them; thus \"worldli-ness\" has been chosen as sharing this twofold meaning of the original. 307 MA raises the question why, when the Bodhisatta had long ago made an aspiration to reach Buddhahood in order to liberate others, his mind now inclined towards inaction. The reason, the commentator says, is that only now, after reaching enlightenment, did he become fully cognizant of the strength of the defilements in people's minds and of the profundity of the Dhamma. Also, he wanted Brahma to entreat him to teach so that beings who venerated Brahma would recognise the precious value of the Dhamma and desire to listen to it. 308 These five monks attended on the Bodhisatta during his period of self-mortification, convinced that he would attain enlightenment and teach them the Dhamma. How-ever, when he abandoned his austerities and resumed taking solid food, they lost faith in him, accused him of reverting to luxury, and deserted him. See MN 36.33. 309 Anantajina: perhaps this was an Ajlvakan epithet for the spiritually perfected individual. 310 According to MA, Upaka thereafter fell in love with a hunter's daughter and married her. When his marriage turned out to be an unhappy one, he returned to the Buddha, entered the Sangha, and became a non-returner. He was reborn in the A vlha heaven, where he attained arahantship. 311 Avuso: a familiar term of address used among equals. 312 See n.17B. 313 The change in address from \"friend\" to \"venerable sir\" (bhante) indicates that they have now accepted the Buddha's claim and are prepared to regard him as their superior. 314 At this point the Buddha preached to them his first ser-mon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dhamma, on the Four Noble Truths.

According to the Vinaya tli.e proper time for bhikkhus to eat 'is between dawn and noon. From noon until the next dawn only liquids are allowed. This formula is analysed at Vsm I, 53-59. Briefly, the signs (nimitta) are the most distinct.ive qualities o.f the object which, when grasped at unmmdfu~l~, can kmdle defiled thoughts; the features (anubyanJana) are the details that may subsequently catch the attention when the first perceptual contact has not been followed up by restraint. \"States of covetousness and grief\" signifies the alternative reactions of desire and aversion, attraction and repulsion, towards sense objects. . Covetousness (abhijjha) here is synonymous wIth sensual desire (kamacchanda), the first of the five hindrances. MA: He does not come to this conclusion about the Notes to Suttas 27 and 28 1219 Triple Gem because the jhanas and the (mundane) direct knowledges are held in common with those outside the Buddha's Dispensation. 325 This, according to MA, shows the moment of the path, and since at this point the noble disciple has still not completed his task, he has not yet come to a conclusion (na tveva nittham gato hoti) about the Triple Gem; rather, he is in the process of coming to a conclusion (nittham gacchati). The sutta employs a pun on the meaning of the expression \"coming to a conclusion\" that is as viable in English as in PalL 326 This shows the occasion when the disciple has attained the fruit of arahantship, and having completed all his tasks in every way, has come to the conclusion about the Triple Gem. SUTIA 28 327 This discourse has been published separately with intro-duction and notes by Nyanaponika Thera, The Greater Discourse on the Elephant-Footprint Simile. 328 The structure of this discourse may be outlined as fol-lows: Ven. Sariputta first enumerates the Four Noble Truths (§2). He then takes up the truth of suffering for analysis into its various aspects (§3). From among these, he selects the last and enumerates the five aggregates affected by clinging (§4). He next selects the first aggre-gate, that of material form (§5). Taking up each of the great elements in tum, he shows it as having two aspects -internal and external -the former being selected for detailed analysis, the latter only briefly mentioned for the sake of completeness and comparison (e.g., §§6-7). Each of the elements is expounded as a basis for insight meditation as well as for developing patience, faith, and equanimity (e.g., §§8-10). Having finished examining the elements, Ven. Sariputta next takes up the aspects of the Four Noble Truths he earlier had put aside. He intro-duces derivative material form by way of the sense fac-ulties and their objects (§27, etc.), then he relates this to"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"1220 The Majjhima Nikiiya 329 330 331 332 333 the other four aggregates of the first noble truth, and finally he sets this whole complex of ideas in relation to the other three noble truths (§28, etc.). Upiidinna, \"clung-to,\" is used in the Abhidhamma as a technical term applicable to bodily phenomena that are produced by kamma. Here, however, it is used in a more general sense as applicable to the entire body insofar as it is grasped as \"mine\" and misapprehended as a self. The phrase \"whatever else\" is intended to include the earth element comprised in those parts of the body not includ-ed in the above enumeration. According to the Abhi-dhamma analysis of matter, the four primary elements are inseparable, and thus each element is also included, though in a subordinate role, in the bodily phenomena listed under the other three elements. MA: This statement is made to underscore the insentient nature (acetaniibhiiva) of the internal earth element by yoking it to the external earth element, the insentient nature of which is much more easily discerned. According to ancient Indian cosmology the cyclical destruction of the world may be due to either water, fire, or wind. See Vsm XIII, 30-65. The notions \"I,\" \"mine,\" and \"1 am,\" represent the three obsessions of personality view, cr,:,-ving, and conceit, respectively. . MA explains that this passage, referring to a bhikkhu who practises meditation on theielements, is intended to show his strength of mind in applying his comprehen-sion of things to undesirable objects arisen at the \"door\" of the ear. By contemplating the experience by way of conditionality and impermanence, he transforms the potentially provocative situation of being subjected to abuse into an opportunity for insight. . 334 Tassa dhtUiiramma7J.am eva cittam pakkhandati. This sentence can be construed in two alternative ways, depending on how the compound dhiitiirammaJ;am is understood. Yen. Nyanaponika takes it as the object of the verb pakkhan-dati, and he understands dhtUu here as \"an impersonal element in general\" capable of including sound, contact, feeling, etc. Thus he translates: \" And his mind enters into 335 336 337 338 339 Notes to Sutta 28 1221 that very object [taking it just as an impersonal] ele-n:'ent.\" Nm rea~s the compound as an adjunct qualifying cttta, and supphes the object of the verb in parenthesis. ~A ~e~ms to support the former reading; MT explicitly IdentifIes dhiitu as the earth element, thus supporting the latter reading. MA explains the phrase \"acquires deci-sion\" to mean that the meditator contemplates the situa-tion by way of elements and thus has neither attachment nor aversion concerning it. MA: This passage is intended to show the strength of the meditating bhikkhu on an occasion when he is subjected to afiliction by way of the body. See MN 21.20. MA: The recollection of the Buddha is undertaken here by recalling that the Blessed One spoke this simile of the saw, the recollection of the Dhamma by recalling the advice given in the simile of the saw, and the recollection of the Sangha by recalling the virtues of the bhikkhu who can endure such abuse without giving rise to a mind of hate. \"Equanimity supported by the wholesome\" (upekkhii kusalanissitii) is the equanimity of insight, the sixfold equanimity of neither attraction nor aversion towards agreeable and disagreeable objects that appear a~ t~e six se~e doors. Strictly speaking, the sixfold equa-nuruty pertams only to the arahant, but it is here ascribed to the monk in training because his insight approximates to the perfect equanimity of the arahant. This is said to stress once again the egoless nature of the body. MT: He shows that the four elements are only mere elements not belonging to a self; they are without a being, without a soul. . This section is set forth, according to MA, to introduce the material form derived from the four great elements. Derived material form, according to the Abhidhamma analysis of matter, includes the five sense faculties (pasttdarupa) and the first four kinds of sense object, the tangible object being identified with the primary ele-ments themselves. \"Corresponding (conscious) engage-ment\" (tajjo samannahiiro) is explained by MA as attention (manasikttra) arising in dependence on the eye and forms;"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"1222 The Majjhima Niktiya 340 341 342 it is identified with the \"five-door adverting conscious-ness\" (pancadvarilvajjanacitta), which breaks off the flow of the life continuum (bhavanga) to initiate a process of cognition.

The \"corresponding class.~f consclO~S­ness\" here is mind-consciousness (manovmfii11Ja), which takes non-sensuouS objects as its sphere of cognition. SUITA29 346 After Oevadatta had unsuccessfully attempted to kill the Buddha and usurp control of the Sangha, he broke away Notes to Suttas 29 and 30 1223 from the Buddha and tried to establish his own sect with himself at the head. See NaDamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp.266-69. 347 \"Knowledge and vision\" (nil1Jadassana) here refers to the divine eye (MA), the ability to see subtle forms invisible to normal vision . . 348 This translation follows the BBS and SBJ eds., which read asamayavimokkhani in the preceding sentence and asamayavimuttiya in this sentence. The PTS ed., on which both Horner and Nm based their translations, is evident-ly mistaken in reading samaya in the two compounds and thanani instead of atthanani. MA cites the Patisambhida-magga (ii.40) for a definition of asamayavimokkha (lit., non-temporary or \"perpetual\" liberation) as the four paths, four fruits, and Nibbana, and of samayavimokkha (tempo-rary liberation) as the four jhanas and four formless attainments. See also MN 122.4. 349 \"Unshakeable deliverance of mind\" is the fruit of ara-hantship (MA). Thus \"perpetual liberation\" -as including all four paths and fruits -has a wider range of meaning than \"unshakeable deliverance of mind,\" which alone is declared to be the goal of the holy life. SUITA 30 350 These six teachers, the Buddha's senior contemporaries, all stood outside the fold of orthodox Brahmanism, and their doctrines are indicative of the speculative audacity of the Buddha's age. The six are often mentioned together in the Canon. Their teachings, as understood within the Buddhist community, are stated at ON 2.17-32/ii.52-59 .. 351 Precisely the same question is posed to the Buddha on the eve of his Pal'inibbana by the wanderer Subhadda at ON 16.5.26-27/ii.150-152. 352 It is this sentence, used in place of the sentence beginning \"He becomes intoxicated ... ,\" that distinguishes these passages of this sutta from the corresponding passages of the preceding sutta. 353 Although the jhanas may also have been included in the attainment of concentration set forth in §lO, and knowl-"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"1224 The Majjhima Nikiiya edge and vision was described as higher than the attain-ment of concentration, the jhanas now become higher than kn.owledge and vision because they are being treated as the basis for the attainment of cessation and the destruction of the taints (in §21).

In a careful study of the contexts in which the word\" Abhidhamma\" occurs in the Sutta Pitakas of several early recensions, the Japanese Pali scholar Fumimaro Watanabe concludes that the Buddha's own disciples formed the conception of Abhidhamma as an elementary philosophical study that attempted to define, analyse, and classify dhammas and to explore their mutual relations. See his Philosophy and its Development in the Nikllyas and Abhidhamma, pp. 34-36. 363 While the replies of the disciples hold up as the ideal a bhikkhu who has already achieved proficiency in a par-ticular sphere of the renunciant life, the Buddha's reply, by focusing on a bhikkhu still striving for the goal, under-scores the ultimate purpose of that life itself. SUITA33 364 See MN 129.2, 27. 365 The Codes (miltika) are probably the rules of the Pati-mokkha abstracted from their explanatory matrix, as well as lists of the primary doctrinal categories used for expounding the Ohamma. For more on the miltikiis see Watanabe, Philosophy and its Development in the Nikllyas and Abhidhamma, pp. 42-45. 366 See n.89. 367 At SN 47:6/v.148 the four foundations of mindfulness are called the proper pasture (gocara) of a bhikkhu, in the sense of being the proper sphere of his activity. SUITA 34 368 See n.273. SUTIA 35 369 According to MA, Saccaka was the son of Nigat:\\tha (Jain) parents who were both skilled in philosophical debate. He had learned a thousand doctrines from his parents and many more philosophical systems from others.

Assaji was one of the first five disciples of the Buddha. This summary of the doctrine omits the second of the three characteristics, dukkha or suffering. MA explains that Assaji omitted this in order to avoid giving Saccaka the opportunity to attempt a refutation of the Buddha's doctrine. MA explains that men play this game when preparing hemp cloth. They bind up handfuls of rough hemp, immerse them in the water, and beat them on planks to the left, right, and middle. A royal elephant saw th.is game, and plunging into the water, he took up water In his trunk and sprayed it on his belly, his body, both sides, and his groin. In asserting the five aggregates to be self he is, of course, directly contradicting the Buddha's teaching of anatta. He ascribes this view to the \"great multitude\" with the thought that \"the majority cannot be wrong.\" The Buddha is here suggesting that the aggregates are not self because they lack one of the essential characteris-tics of selfhood -being susceptible to the exercise of mas-tery. What cannot come under my mastery or perfect control cannot be identified as \"my self.\" MA identifies this spirit (yakkha) as Sakka, ruler of the gods. The text between the asterisks is absent from the PTS ed. but is supplied from the BBS and SBJ eds. The five aggre-gates are here called suffering because they are imperma-nent and not susceptible to the exercise of mastery. . These are the characteristics of a sekha. The arahant, In contrast, not only possesses the right view of non-self, but has used it to eradicate all clinging, as the Buddha will explain in §25. MA gives several alternative explanations of these three terms. They are mundane and supramundane wisdom, practice, and deliverance. Or they are entirely supram~­dane: the first is the right view of the path of arahantshlP, the second the remaining seven path factors, the third the supreme fruit (of arahantship). Or the first is the vision of Notes to Suttas 35 and 36 1227 Nibbana, the second the path factors, the third the supreme fruit. 379 Though Saccaka admitted defeat in debate, he must have still considered himself a saint, and thus did not feel impelled to go for refuge to the Triple Gem. Also, because he continued to regard himself as a saint, he must have felt that it was not proper for him to dedicate the merit of the alms offering to himself, and thus he wished to dedicate the merit to the Licchavis. But the Buddha replies that the Licchavis will gain the merit of providing Saccaka with food to offer to the Buddha, while Saccaka himself will gain the merit of offering the food to the Buddha. The merit of giving alms differs in quality according to the purity of the recipient, as explained at MN 142.6. SUTIA36 380 MA: Saccaka approached with the intention of refuting the Buddha's doctrine, which he failed to do in his earlier encounter with the Buddha (in MN 35). But this time he came alone, thinking that if he were to suffer defeat no one would know about it. He intended to refute the Buddha with his question about sleeping during the day, which he does not ask until close to the end of the sutta (§45). 381 MA: Ananda says this out of compassion for Saccaka, thinking that if he gets to see the Buddha and to hear the Dhamma, it will lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time. 382 It will become clear from §5 that Saccaka identif).es \"development of body\" (kayabhavanii) with the practice of self-mortifi~ation. Because he does not see the Buddhist bhikkhus engaged in self-mortification, he maintains that they do not pursue development of the body. But the Buddha (according to MA) understands \"development of body\" as insight meditation, \"development of mind\" (citta-bhlivanii) as serenity meditation. 383 These are the three mentors of the Ajlvakas; the last was a contemporary of the Buddha, the former two are near legendary figures whose identities remain obscure. The"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"1228 The Majjhima Nikaya Bodhisatta had adopted their practices during his period of asceticism - see MN 12.45 -but subsequently rejected them as'unconducive to enlightenment. 384 MA explains that \"development of body\" here is insight, and \"development of mind\" concentration. When the noble disciple experiences pleasant feeling, he does not become overwhelmed by it because, through his devel-opment of insight, he understands the feeling to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, and essenceless; and when he experiences painful feeling, he does not become over-whelmed by it because, through his development of con-centration, he is able to escape from it by entering into one of the meditative absorptions. 385 Now the Buddha will answer Saccaka's questions by showing first the extremely painful feelings he experi-enced during his course of ascetic practices, and there-after the extremely pleasant feelings he experienced dur-ing his meditative attainments preceding his enlighten-ment. 386 The PTS ed. is certainly mistaken in reading here avapakattho, \"not withdrawn. II Nm in Ms had translated this sentence from a reading which omitted cittena, II and mentally.\" This translation follows the BBS ed., which includes cittena. Although it may seem contradictory to say that those ,recluses and brahmins live mentally withdrawn from sensual pleasures yet still have not abandoned sensual desire, if we understand kama here as physical objects productive of se:i;l.sual pleasure the contradiction will be resolved. 387 In this connection MA raises the question: Why did the Bodhisatta undertake the practice of austerities if he could have attained Buddhahood without doing so? It answers: He did so, first, in order to show his own exertion to the world, because the quality of invincible energy gave him joy; and second, out of compassion for later generations, by inspiring them to strive with the same determination that he applied to the attainment of enlightenment. 388 This sentence, repeated at the end of each of the follow-ing sections as well, answers the second of the two ques-tions posed by Saccaka in §11. 389 MA: During the Bodhisatta's boyhood as a prince, on one 390 391 392 393 394 Notes to Sutta 36 1229 occasion his father led a ceremonial ploughing at a tradi-tional festival of the Sakyans. The prince was brought to the festival and a place was prepared for him under a rose-apple tree. When his attendants left him to watch the ploughing ceremony, the prince, finding himself all alone, spontaneously sat up in the meditation posture and attained the first jhana through mindfulness of breathing. When the attendants returned and found the boy seated in meditation, they reported this to the king, who came and bowed down in veneration to his son. This passage marks a change in the Bodhisatta's evalua-tion of pleasure; now it is no longer regarded as some-thing to be feared and banished by the practice of austeri-ties, but, when born of seclusion and detachment, is seen as a valuable accompaniment of the higher stages along the path to enlightenment. See MN 139.9 on the twofold division of pleasure. This sentence answers the first of the two questions posed by Saccaka in §11. MA explains the \"sign of concentration\" (samadhinimitta) here as the fruition attainment of emptiness (sufifiata-phalasamapatti). See also MN 122.6. This was the question that Saccaka originally intended to ask the Buddha. MA explains that though arahants have eliminated all sloth and torpor, they still need to sleep in order to dispel the physical tiredness intrinsic to th€ body. MA .explains that even though Saccaka did not reach any attamment or even become established in the Three Refuges, the Buddha taught him two long suttas in order to deposit in him a mental impression (vasana) coming to maturity in the future. For he foresaw that at a later time, after the Dispensation became established in Sri Lanka Saccaka would be reborn there and would attain ara~ hantship as the great arahant, Kala Buddharakkhita Thera.

SUTIA38 402 403 According to MA, through faulty reasoning based on ~e fact of rebirth, Sati came to the conclusion that a perSIst-ing consciousness transmigrating from one existence to another is necessary to explain rebirth. The first part of the sutta (down to §8) replicates the opening of MN 22, the only difference being in the view espoused. This is the last of the six views described at MN 2.8. See n.40. Notes to Sutta 38 1231 404 MA: The purpose of the simile is to show that there is no transmigration of consciousness across the sense doors. Just as a log fire burns in dependence on logs and ceases when its fuel is finished, without transmigrating to fag-gots and becoming reckoned as a faggot fire, so too, con-sciousness arisen in the eye door dependent on the eye and forms ceases when its conditions are removed, with-out transmigrating to the ear, etc., and becoming reck-oned as ear-consciousness, etc. Thus the Buddha says in effect: \"In the occurrence of consciousness there is not even the mere transmigration from door to door, so how can this misguided Sati speak of transmigration from existence to existence?\" 405 Bhatam idan ti. MA: \"This\" refers to the five aggregates. Having shown the conditionality of consciousness, the Buddha states this passage to show the conditionality of all the five aggregates, which come into being through conditions, their \"nutriment,\" and pass out of being with the ceasing of those conditions. In the following tadahllrasambhavam, MA takes the tad as a nominative rep-resenting the subject (= tam khandhapaiicakam), but it seems more likely that it qualifies ahara and that both should be taken as ablatives, the subject idam being understood. This interpretation seems confirmed by the third statement, tadiiharanirodhti yam bhutam tam nirodhadhammam. Homer's \"This is the origination of nutriment\" is clearly wrong. 406 This is said to show the bhikkhus that they should not cling even to the right view of insight meditation. The simile of the raft refers to MN 22.13, 407 On the four nutriments, see n.120. MA: The Buddha states this passage and the following one linking up the nutriments with dependent origination in order to show that he knows not merely the five aggregates but the entire chain of conditions responsible for their being. 408 This is a statement of the abstract principle of dependent origination exemplified by the twelvefold formula. The abstract principle on cessation is stated at §22. Nm had rendered the principle of arising thus: \"That is when this is; that arises with the arising of this.\" And the principle of cessation: \"That is not when this is not; that ceases with"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"_1_23_2 __ T_h_e_M_a~h_hl_.m_a_N_I_.~~y~a ___________________________ ~ the cessation of this.\" 409 As in MN 2.7. According to MA, this \"running back into the pas~\" and \"running forward to the future\" occur because of craving and views. The next passage drives home the lesson by ensuring that the bhikkhus speak from their own personal knowledge. 410 The following portion of the discourse may be under-stood as a concrete application of dependent origination _ so far expressed only as a doctrinal formula -to the course of individual existence. The passage §§26-29 may be taken to show the factors from consciousness through feeling that result from past ignorance and formations, §40 the causal factors of craving and clinging as they build up a continuation of the samsaric round. The fol-lowing section (§§31-40), connecting dependent origina-tion to the appearance of the Buddha and his teaching of the Dhamma, shows the practice of the Dhamma to be the means of bringing the round to an end. 411 Gandhabba. MA: The gandhabba is the being to be reborn. It is not someone (i.e., a disembodied spirit) standing nearby watching the future parents having intercourse, but a being driven on by the mechanism of kamma, due to be reborn on that occasion. 412 MA explains that he delights in the painful feeling by clinging to it with thoughts of \"1\" and \"mine.\" In confir-mation of the statement that a worldling may delight in painful feelings, one thinks not only of full-fledged masochism but also of the common tendency of people to put themselves into distressing situations in order to reinforce their sense of ego. 413 MA: An immeasurable mind (appamllIJacetaso) is a supra-mundane mind; this means that he possesses the path. 414 This statement reveals that the chain of dependent origi-nation is broken at the link between feeling and craving. Feeling arises necessarily because the body acqUired through past craving is subject to the maturation of past kamma. However, if one does not delight in feeling, craving will not have the opportunity to arise and set off reactions of like and dislike that provide further fuel for Notes to Suttas 38 and 39 1233 the round, and thus the round will come to an end. SUITA39 415 \"Brahmin\" should be understood in the sense explained below, §24. 416 Shame (hiri) and fear of wrongdoing (ottappa) are two complementary qualities designated by the Buddha \"the guardians of the world\" (AN i.51) because they serve as the foundation for morality. Shame has the characteristic of disgust with evil, is dominated by a sense of self-respect, and manifests itself as conscience. Fear of wrong-doing has the characteristic of dread of evil, is dominated by a concern for the opinions of others, and manifests itself as fear of doing evil. See Vsm XIV, 142. 417 MA quotes SN 45:35-36/v.25: \"What, bhikkhus, is recluseship (sllmafifia)? The Noble Eightfold Path ... -this is called recluseship. And what, bhikkhus, is the goal of recluseship (sllmafffiattho)? The destruction of greed, hate, and delusion -this is called the goal of recluseship.\" 418 MA gives a detailed elaboration of each of the five simi-les. An English translation can be found in Nyanaponika Thera, The Five Mental Hindrances, pp. 27-34. 419 Each of the explanations to follow involves a word play that cannot be reproduced in English, e.g., a bhikkhu is a recluse (samaIJa) because he has quieted down (samita) evil states, a brahmin because he has expelled (bllhita) evil states, etc. 420 The term \"washed\" (nhataka) refers to a brahmin who, at the end of his discipleship under his teacher, has taken a ceremonial bath marking the end of his training. See Sn 521. 421 The Pali word sotthiya (Sanskrit, srotriya) means a brah-min well versed in the Vedas, one conversant with sacred knowledge. SUITA40 422 Where the previous sutta used the phrase \"things that"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"1234 The Majjhima Nikaya make one a recluse\" (dhammii samaIJakaraIJil), the present sutta speaks of \"the way proper to the recluse\" (samaIJa-samlcipatipada) . 423 The first ten of these twelve \"stains for a recluse\" are included among the sixteen \"imperfections that defile the mind\" at MN 7.3. 424 MA: Because he has quieted down (samita) all defile-ments, he is a recluse in the highest sense (para-matthasamaIJa) . SUTIA41 425 This is a morally nihilistic materialist view that denies an afterlife and kammic retribution. \"There is nothing given\" means that there is no fruit of giving; \"no this world, no other world\" that there is no rebirth into either this world or a world beyond; \"no mother, no father\" that there is no fruit of good conduct and bad conduct towards mother and father. The statement about recluses and brahmins denies the existence of Buddhas and arahants. 426 MA explains that \"the gods of Radiance\" is not a sepa-rate class of gods but a collective name for the three classes that follow; the same applies to \"the gods of Glory.\" This celestial hierarchy is explained in the Introduction, pp. 46-48. 427 It should be Roted that while \"conduct in accordance with the Dhamma\" as described in the sutta is a neces-sary condition for rebirth in the higher heavenly worlds and for the destruction of the taints; it is by no means a sufficient condition. Rebirth into the realms beginning with the gods of Brahma's retinue requires the attain-ment of jhana, rebirth into the Pure Abodes (the five beginning with the Aviha gods) the attainment of the stage of non-returner, rebirth into the immaterial planes the corresponding immaterial attainments, and the destruction of the taints requires the full practice of the Noble Eightfold Path up to the path of arahantship. Notes to Sutta 43 1235 SUITA43 428 Yen. Maha KoHhita was declared by the Buddha the foremost disciple of those who have attained the analyti-cal knowledges (patisambhidil). 429 According to MA, the understanding of the Four Noble Truths being discussed here is penetration by the supra-mundane path. Thus the lowest type of person to be described as \"one who is wise\" (paflflava) is the person on the path of stream-entry. The rendering of paflflil as \"wis-dom\" (w?ich I substituted for Nm's \"understanding\") has the dlsadvantage of severing the tie, evident in the Pali, with the verb pajanati. To preserve the connection here and in the preceding paragraph, the verb has bee~ rendered \"wisely understand.\" 430 The Pa~~_ p~~as~_ def~ning consciousness uses only the verb, Vl]anatl Vl]aniltl, and this could as well be under-syood to mean \"One cognizes, one cognizes.\" Although Nm had translated this phrase without any pronoun, the prono~ has been inserted for greater intelligibility. The r~ndermgs of the verb definitions of feeling and percep-hon at §7 and §8 have been similarly augmented by the addition of the pronoun. . 431 MA: The question concerns the consciousness with which the person described as \"one who is wise\" exam-ine~ formations; that is, the consciousness of insight by w~ch that person arrived (at his attainment), the mind whlch does the .w~rk of meditation. Yen. Sariputta ~wers by, ~xplammg the meditation subject of feeling, m the way It has come down in the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness (MN 10.32). The Pali con-s~ction, sukhan ti pi vijilnati, indicates that the feeling is bemg treated as a direct object of consciousness rather than as an affective tone of the experience; to show this the words \"this is\" have been supplied in brackets and the entire phrase set in quotation marks. 432 MA: This statement refers to the wisdom and conscious-ness on the occasions of both insight and the supramun-dane p~th. The two are conjoined in that they arise and cease slmultaneously and share a single sense base and"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"1236 The Majjhima Nikaya object. However, the two are not inseparably conjoined since, while wisdom always requires consciousness, con-sciousness can occur without wisdom. 433 Wisdom, being the path factor of right view, is to be developed as a factor of the path. Consciousness, being included among the five aggregates that pertain to the noble truth of suffering, is to be fully understood - as impermanent, suffering, and not self. 434 MA says that the question and reply refer to mundane feelings that are the objective range of insight. The Pali construction here, sukham pi vedeti, etc., shows feeling as simultaneously a quality of the object and an affective tone of the experience by which it is apprehended. MA points out that feeling itself feels; there is no other (sepa-rate) feeler. 435 MA: The question and reply refer to mundane percep-tions that are the objective range of insight. 436 MA: Wisdom has been excluded from this exchange because the intention is to show only the states that are conjoined on every occasion of consciousness. 437 MA: Purified mind-consciousness (parisuddha mano-vififia1}-a) is the consciousness of the fourth jhana. It can know the immaterial attainments insofar as one estab-lished in the fourth jhana is capable of reaching them. The base of neither-perception-nor':non-perception is excluded here because, owing to its subtlety, it does not come into the direct range of contemplation for the attainment of insight. . 438 MA: The eye of wisdom (pafifiac(1kkhu) is wisdom itself, called an eye in the sense that it is an organ of spiritual vision. 439 For the distinction between direct knowledge (abhififia) and full understanding (parififia), see n.23. 440 MA: \"The voice of another\" (parato ghosa) is the teaching of beneficial Dhamma. These two conqitions are neces-sary for disciples to arrive at the right view of insight and the right view of the supramuridane path. But paccekabuddhas arrive at their enlightenment and fully enlightened Buddhas at omniscience solely in depen-dence on wise attention without \"the voice of another.\" Notes to Sutta 43 1237 441 MA: Right view here is the right view pertaining to the path of arahantship. \"Deliverance of mind\" and \"deliver-ance by wisdom\" both refer to the fruit of arahantship; see n.83. When one fulfils these five factors, the path of arahantship arises and yields its fruit. 442 \"Renewal of being in the future\" (ayatirh punabbhava-bhinibbatti) is rebirth, the continuation of the round. This question and the next may be regarded as synoptic approaches to the entire twelvefold formula of depen-dent origination laid out in MN 38.17 and 20. 443 The five outer sense faculties each have their own unique object - forms for the eye, sounds for the ear, etc. -but the mind faculty is able to experience the objects of all five sense faculties as well as the mental objects exclusive to itself. Hence the other five faculties have mind as their resort (manopatisara1}-arh). 444 MA identifies vitality (ayu) with the life faculty (jfvit-indriya), which has the function of maintaining and vital-ising the other material phenomena of the living body. 445 Heat (usma) is the kamma-born heat intrinsic to the liv-ingbody. 446 \"Vital formations\" (ayusankhara), according to MA, denotes vitality itself. They cannot be states of feeling because they are required to keep the body of a bhikkhu alive when he has attained to the cessation of perception and feeling. This special meditative attainment, in which all mental activity ceases, is accessible only to non-returners and arahants who also have mastery over the eight attainments on the side of serenity. For a brief dis-cussion see the Introduction, p. 28, and for the f~ll scholastic account, Vsm XXIII, 16-52. The cessation of perception and feeling will be taken up again in MN 44. 447 That is, dead. The departure of consciousness from the body is not sufficient to constitute death; vitality and the vital heat must also perish. 448 The bodily formations are in-and-out breathing, the ver-bal formations are applied thought and sustained thought, the mental formations are perception and feel-ing - see MN 44.14-15. MA says that the filculties during the ordinary course of life, being impinged upon by"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"1238 The Majjhima Nikaya sense objects, are afflicted and soiled like a mirror set up at a crossroads; but the faculties of one in cessation become exceptionally clear like a mirror placed in a case and deposited in a box. 449 MA: The \"signless deliverance of mind\" (animittct cetovimutti) is the attainment of fruition; the \" signs \" are objects such as forms, etc.; the \"signless element\" is Nibbana, in which all signs of conditioned things are absent. 450 MA identifies this suflflatii cetovimutti with insight into the voidness of selfhood in persons and things. 451 As above, the signless deliverance of mind is identified by MA with the attainment of fruition. Of the four deliv-erances of mind mentioned in §30, this one alone is supramundane. The first three -the brahmavihiiras, the third immaterial attainment, and insight into the void-ness of formations - all pertain to the mundane level. 452 Lust, hate, and delusion may be understood as \"makers of measurement\" (pamiiIJakaraIJa) in that they impose lim-itations upon the range and depths of the mind; MA, however, explains this phrase to mean that the defile-ments enable one to measure a person as a worldling, a stream-enterer, a once-returner, or a non-returner. 453 MA: There are twelve immeasurable deliverances of mind: the four 'brahmavihiiras, the four paths, and the four fruits. The unshakeable deliverance of mind is the fruit of arahantship. The statement that this unshakeable deliver-ance is void of lust, hate, and delusion - repeated at the end of §36 and §37 as well -also identifies it as the supramundane deliverance of mind through voidness. 454 The word kiflcana is explained by MA as meaning \"impediment\" or \"obstacle.\" Nm rendered it as \"own-ing.\" I have gone back to the original meaning \"some-thing\" to maintain coherence with the statement that its abandonment issues in deliverance of mind through nothingness. 455 MA: There are nine deliverances of mind through nothing-ness: the base of nothingness and the four paths and fruits. 456 MA interprets the phrase \"maker of signs\" (nimitta-karaIJa) to mean that lust, hate, and delusion brand a per-Notes to Suttas 43 and 44 1239 son as a worldling or a noble one, as lustful, hating, or deluded. But it may al.so mean that these defilements cause the mind to ascribe a false significance to things as being permanent, pleasurable, self, or beautiful. 457 MA: There are thirteen signless deliverances of mind: insight, because it removes the signs of permanence, pleasure, and self; the four immaterial attainments, because they lack the sign of material form; and the four paths and fruits, because of the absence of the sign of defilements. 458 All the four deliverances of mind are one in meaning in that they all refer to the fruition attainment of ara-hantship. MA also points out that the four deliverances are one in meaning because the terms - the immeasur-able, nothingness, voidness, and the signless - are all names for Nibbana, which is the object of the fruition attainment of arahantship. SVITA 44 459 Visakha was a wealthy merchant of Rajagaha and a non-returner. Dhammadinna, his former wife in lay life, had attained arahantship soon after her ordination as a bhikkhunI. She was declared by the Buddha the foremost bhikkhuru disciple in expounding the Dhamma. 460 MA explains the compound panc'upiidiinakkhandhti as the five aggregates that become the condition for clinging (MT: as its objects). Since these five aggregates are, in brief, the entire noble truth of suffering (MN 9.15; 28.3), it ~ill be seen that the first four questions pose an inqu~ry m~o the Four Noble Truths expressed in terms of person-alIty rather than suffering. 461 MA: Because clinging is only one part of the aggregate of formations (as defined here, greed), it is not the same as the five aggregates; and because clinging cannot be alto-gether disconnected from the aggregates, there is no clinging apart from the aggregates. 462 These are the twenty kinds of personality view. MA quotes Pts i.144-45 to illustrate the four basic modes of personality view in regard to material form. One may"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"1240 The Majjhinia Niki:iya 463 464 465 466 467 regard material form as self, in the way the flame of a burning oil-lamp is identical with the colour (of the flame). Or one may regard self as possessing material form, as a tree possesses a shadow; or one may regard material fonn as in self, as the scent is in the flower; or one may regard self as in material form, as a jewel is in a casket. The word khandha here has a different meaning than in the more common context of the five aggregates affected by clinging. It here refers to a body of training principles, the three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path into virtue (sIla), concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (panna). The four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of con-centration (samadhinimitta) in the sense of being its condi-tion (MA). Here it would seem incorrect to translate nimitta as \"sign,\" in the sense of either distinguishing mark or object. The four right kinds of striving are explained at MN 77.16. MA: Dhammadinna anticipated Visakha's intention to ask about the formations that cease when one enters the attainment of cessation. Thus she explained the three formations in this way rather than as wholesome and unwholesome volitions of body, speech, and mind, the meaning relevant within the context of dependent origination. . MA explains further that the bodily formation and the mental formation are said to be formations \"bound up\" with the body and the mind in the sense that they are formed by the body and by the mind, while the verbal for-mation is a formation in the sense that it forms speech. The verb form vitakketva vicaretvii has been rendered in a way that maintains consistency with the rendering of the nouru; vitakka and victira as \"applied thought\" and \"sus-tained thought.\" Cessation can be attained only by a non-returner or an arahant with mastery over the eight jhanic attainments. The meditator enters each attainment in turn, emerges from it, and contemplates it with insight as impermanent, suffering, and not self. After completing this procedure with the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and attending to certain preliminaries, the meditator 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 Notes to Sutta 44 1241 determines to be without mind for a particular length of time. His determination, backed by his previous accom-plishments and preparations, leads him into the attain-ment of cessation. See Vsm XXIII,32-43. Applied and sustained thought cease first in the second jhana; in-and-out breathing cease next in the fourth jhana; and perception and feeling cease last in the attain-ment of cessation itself. When the time decided upon by the determination for the attainment has lapsed, by reason of that prior deter-mination the meditator spontaneously emerges from the attainment of cessation and the mind-process resumes. MA: When one emerges from cessation, the conscious-ness of fruition attainment arises first, and the perception and feeling associated with that are the mental formation that arises first. Then, with the subsequent descent into the life continulUn, the bodily formation, i.e., breathing, recommences. And subsequently, when the meditator resumes his ordinary activity, the verbal formation arises. The first state of consciousness to arise on emerging from cessation is that of fruition attainment, which is called voidness, the signless, and the desireless because of its own inherent quality and because of its object, Nibbana. Here these three names for fruition are assigned to the contact associated with fruition. MT: Nibbana, the object of the fruition consciousness that arises on emerging from cessation, is called seclusion (viveka) because it is secluded from all conditioned things. MT: The three defilements are called anusaya, underlying tendencies, in the sense that they have not been aban-doned in the mental continuum to which they belong and because they are capable of arising when a suitable cause presents itself. MA explains that the bhikkhu suppresses the tendency to lust and attains the first jhana. Having made the tenden-cy to lust well suppressed by the jhana, he develops insight and eradicates the tendency to lust by the path of the non-returner. But because it has been suppressed by the jhana, it is said \"the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie that.\""},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"1242 The Majjhima Niktiya 475 MA identifies \"that base\" (fadtiyatana), as well as \"the supreme liberations,\" with arahantship. The grief that arises because of that longing is elsewhere called \"the grief based on renunciation\" (MN 137.13). MA explains that one does not actually abandon the tendency to aver-sion by means of that grief; rather, spurred on by the long-ing for the supreme liberations, one takes up the practice with firm determination and eradicates the tendency to aversion by attaining the path of the non-returner. 476 MA: The bhikkhu suppresses the tendency to ignorance with the fourth jhana, makes it well suppressed, and then eradicates the tendency to ignorance by attaining the path of arahantship. 477 The word \"counterpart\" (patibhtiga) is used to express the relationships of both opposition and supplementation. 478 Ignorance is its counterpart because neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is subtle and difficult to recognise. 479 MT: Nibbana does have an opposite counterpart, namely, conditioned states. But in the strict sense it has no sup-plementary counterpart, for how can there be anything to supplement Nibbana, the unconditioned? 480 MA: By saying this, the Buddha makes this sutta Word of the Conqueror, stamped as it were with the seal of the Conqueror. SUITA46 481 A full analysis of the things that should and should not be followed is presented in MN 114. SUITA47 482 Parassa cetopariytiyam ajtinantena, reading the last word with the BBS and SBJ eds. rather than with the PTS ed. as iijiinantena, which gives the positive sense \"know-ing.\" In the context the negative is clearly required, since the bhikkhu who cannot know by direct cognition of the Buddha's mind that he is fully enlightened must arrive at this conclusion by inference from his bodily 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 Notes to 5utta 47 1243 and verbal behaviour and the other evidence adduced by the sutta. Bodily actions are \"states cognizable through the eye.\" Words are \"states cognizable through the ear.\" MA: Just as one infers the presence of fish from the rippling and bubbling of water, so from a defiled action or utterance one infers that the mind originating it is defiled. MT: \"Mixed states\" (vltimissii dhammti) refers to the con-duct of one who is engaged in purifying his conduct but is unable to keep to it consistently. Sometimes his con-duct is pure or bright, sometimes impure or dark. MA: The dangers are conceit, arrogance, etc. For some bhikkhus, as long as they have not become well known or acquired a following, these dangers are not found, and they are very calm and quiet; but when they have become famous and have acquired a following, they go about behaving improperly, attacking other bhikkhus like a leopard pouncing on a herd of deer. MA: The opposite of those who teach a group - those who dwell detached from a group -though not men-tioned, should be understood. MA: This passage shows the Buddha's impartiality (ttidibhtiva) towards beings: he does not' extol some and disparage others. No ca tena tammayo. MA glosses: \"I do not identify with that purified virtue, I am without craving for it.\" 50 tasmini dhamme abhififitiya idh'ekaccam dhammani dhammesu nitthani gacchati. In order to convey the intend-ed meaning I have rendered the second occurrence of dhamma here as \"teaching,\" i.e., the particular doctrine taught to him, the plural dhammesu as \"teachings,\" anp tasmini dhamme as \"that Dhamma,\" in the sense of the total teaching. MA and MT together explicate the mean-ing thus: When the Dhamma has been taught by the Teacher, by directly knowing the Dham.ma through pen-etration of the path, fruit, and Nibbana, the bhikkhu comes to a conclusion about the preliminary teaching of the Dhamma on the requisites of enlightenment (bodhi-pakkhiyti dhammli)."},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"1244 The Majjhima Nilalya 490 Akilravatr saddhii dassanilmulikti da!hii.

SUTIA48 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 The background to this sutta is the quarrel at KosambI, which is related at Yin Mv Kh 10 (Vin i.337 ff.) and in NaI)amoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 109-19. The quarrel, which began with a casual misunderstanding of a minor disciplinary rule, quickly flared up and divided a large part of the Sangha and laity resident at KosambI into two hostile factions. MA: This is the right view belonging to the noble path. The Four Noble Truths. Dhammatii. This is a breach of the code of monastic discipline from which a bhikkhu can be rehabilitated either by a formal act of the Sangha or by confession to another bhikkhu. Even though a noble disciple may commit stich an offence unintentionally or through lack of knowledge, he makes no attempt to conceal it but immediately discloses it and seeks the means of rehabilitation. Balatii. See n.91. , MA calls those seven factors the \"great reviewing knowl-edges\" (mahapaccavekkha1Jl1iiiiIJa) of a stream-enterer. On the reviewing knowledges see Vsm XXII, 19-21. SUITA49 499 The Mulapariyllya Sutta (MN 1) was also delivered by the Buddha while he was living in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkattha, and the similarity in formulation and theme between these two suttas -perhaps the only two record-ed as originating at Ukkattha - is striking. It is even pos-sible to see the present sutta as a dramatic representation of the same ideas set forth by the Mulapariyaya in abstract philosophical terms. Thus Baka the Brahma may be taken Notes to Sutta 49 1245 to represent being or personality in its most eminent form, blindly engaged in the activity of conceiving, sus-taining itself with its delusions of permanence, pleasure, and selfhood. Underlying being is craving, symbolised by Mara - seemingly inconspicuous in the assembly, yet the real author of all the outpourings of conceiving, the one who holds the entire universe in his grip. The alliance of Brahma and Mara, God and Satan, an incomprehensible union from the perspective of Western theism, points to the thirst for continued being as the hidden root of all world affirmation, whether theistic or non-theistic. In the sutta the superficial theoretical contest between Baka and the Buddha soon gives way to a gripping deep-level con-frontation between Mara and the Buddha -Mara as crav-ing demanding the affirmation of being, the Enlightened One pointing to the cessation of being through the uprooting of delight. 500 A similar encounter between the Buddha and Baka is recorded at SN 6:4/i.142-44, though without the dramat-ic trappings of this meeting and with an extended exchange in verse. According to MA and MT, he held this etemalist view with regard to both his own individ-ual personality and the world over which he presided. His denial of an \"escape beyond\" is a rejection of the higher jhana planes, the paths and fruits, and Nibbana, none of which he even knows exist. 501 MA: When Mara discovered that the Buddha had gone to the Brahma-world, he became anxious that the Brahmas might be won over to the Dhamma and escape from his control; thus he went there to discourage the Buddha from teaching the Dhamma. 502 MA: Because they considered it to be impermanent, suf-fering, and not self. 503 MA: In the four states of deprivation. Here, and at §10 and §29, the word \"body\" (kaya) is used to mean plane of existence. 504 MA: They lauded it by speaking praise of it as perma-nent, everlasting, eternal, etc., and delighted in it by way of craving and views. 505 MA: In the Brahma-world."},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"1246 The Majjhima Nikaya 506 507 508 509 510 511 MA; Mara's intention is to show: \"If you do as Brahma says without overstepping his word, you too will shine with the same splendour and glory as that with which the Brahma's Assembly shines.\" MA says that by the first two terms he tries to cajole ~e B ddha by the remaining two terms he threatens him. u , . To \"hold to earth\" is to grasp it by way of cravmg, con-ceit, and views. The list of categories here, though con-densed is reminiscent of MN 1. MA: B~ka Brahma was a Brahma exercising sovereignty over a thousand world-systems, but above him there are Brahmas exercising sovereignty over two, three, four, five, ten thousand, and a hundred thousand world-syst~ms. The body of Streaming Radiance is a realm of re~~rth per-taining to the second jhana, while Baka Brahma s realm pertains only to the first jhana. The body of Refulgent Glory and the body of Great Fruit in the next paragraph pertain to the third and fourth jhanas:. In the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1.2.2-6/11.17-19) the ~uddha shows how Maha Brahma gives rise to the delusIOn that he is the supreme creator God. When the wor~d begins to form again after a period of dissolution, a bemg of great merit is the first to be reborn in the newly formed Brahma-world. Subsequently, other beings take rebirt~ in ~he Brahma-world and this causes Maha ~rahma to unagme that he is their cJ;eator and master. See Bodhl, The Discourse on the All~Embracing Net of Views, pp. 69-70, 159-166. . This passage, parallel in structure to the correspondmg passage of MN 1, is a difficult one. The difficulty centres around the verb used in the first four statem~nts regarding earth, about which there is not even certamty as to the correct reading. Nm prefers the BBS ed. read~ ing apahosim, which he takes to be an aorist of pabhava~~, meaning \"to produce, to give being to.\" MA glosse~: I did not grasp earth through the obsessions of crav~ng, conceit, and views.\" Nm had rendered ananubhutar:; as \"not co-essential with.\" This has been replaced by not commensurate with,\" following MA's gloss, \"n~t reached by earth\" and MT: \"Its nature is not shared 111 common with earth.\" MA says that what is \"not cotn-512 513 514 515 Notes to Sutta 49 1247 mensurate with the earthness of earth\" is Nibbana, which is detached from all that is conditioned. The PTS ed. is surely mistaken in omitting here the ti ending a direct quotation, and this misleads Homer into ascribing the following passage to Baka rather than to the Buddha (MLS 1:392). The BBS and SBJ eds. supply the ti. These lines (which also appear as part of a full verse at DN 11.85/i.223) have been a perennial challenge to Buddhist scholarship, and even Acariya Buddhaghosa seems to founder over them. MA takes the subject of the sentence to be Nibbana, called \"consciousness\" in the sense that \"it can be cognized.\" This is obviously a contrived derivation, since nowhere in the Canon is Nibbana ever described as consciousness. MA offers three explanations of the phrase sabbato pabham: (1) completely possessed of splendour (pabha); (2) possessing being (pabhutam) every-where; and (3) a ford (pabham) accessible from all sides, Le., through any of the thirty-eight meditation objects. Only the first of these seems to have any linguistic legiti-macy. Nm, in Ms, explains that he takes pabham to be a negative present participle of pabhavati -apabham -the negative-prefix a dropping off in conjunction with sabbato: \"The sense can be paraphrased freely by 'not predicating being in relation to \"all,'\" or 'not assuming of \"all\" that it is or is not in an absolute sense.'\" As an alternative translation more in keeping with MA, Maurice Walshe renders: \" ... consciousness [that] is sign-less, boundless, all-luminous\" (Thus Have I Heard, p. 179). The Buddha's disappearance seems to be a \"visible\" demonstration of his verse. Having extirpated delight in being, he is able to vanish from the sight of Baka, th~ supreme representative of being and world affirmation. But Baka, bound to being by clinging, cannot transcend the range of the Buddha's knowledge, which encompass-es both being and non-being at the same time that it tran-scends them. This is the same inclination that arose in the Buddha's mind in the period immediately after his enlightenment -see MN 26.19. Compare also DN 16.3.34/iL112 where Mara attempts to persuade the newly enlightened"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"1248 The Majjhima Nikaya Buddha to pass away peacefully at once. 516 Tadiso: that is, whether he teaches or not he remains the Tathagata. SUTIA50 517 The name means \"the Corrupter\" or \"the Corrupted One.\" In the Buddhist conception of the universe the position of Mara, like that of Maha Brahma, is a fixed one that is assumed by different individuals in accordance with their kamma. 518 Kakusandha was the first Buddha to arise in this present cosmological cycle called the \"Auspicious Age.\" He was followed by the Buddhas KonagamaD-a and Kassapa, after whom the present Buddha Gotama arose. 519 The name means \"the Unrivalled.\" 520 One who has attained to cessation, it seems, is not subject to injury or death within the attainment itself. At Vsm XXIII, 37 it is said that the attainment protects even his belongings such as his robes and seat from destruction. 521 The name means \"the Survivor.\" 522 That is, by causing defilements to arise in their minds, he will prevent them from escaping from samsara. 523 MA takes pains to point out that M~ra did not exercise control over their actions, in which case he alone would have beentesponsible and the brahmins could not have generated bad kamma by their deeds. Rather, Mara caused the brahmins to imagine scenes of the bhikkhus engaged in improper conduct, and this aroused their antagonism and induced them to harass the bhikkhus. Mara's intent in doing so was to make the bhikkhus give rise to anger and dejection. 524 \"The Kinsman\" (bandhu) is Brahma, who was called thus by the brahmins because they regarded him as their pri~ mal ancestor. MA explains that it was a belief among the brahmins that they themselves were the offspring of Brahma's mouth, the khattiyas of his breast, the vessas of his belly, the suddas of his legs, and sama1Jas of the soles of his feet. 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 Notes to Suttas 50 and 51 1249 Jhayanti paJjhilyanti nijjhayanti apajjhayanti. Though the verbs individually do not have an established pejorative sense, the string is obviously intended as a denigration. At MN 108.26 the four verbs are used to describe the meditation of One whose mind is obsessed by the five hindrances. The four brahmavihilras are the appropriate antidote for the hostility of others, as well as for the tendencies to anger and dejection in one's own mind. This time Mara's intent was to cause the bhikkhus to fall victim to pride, complacency, and negligence. MA quotes a sutta (AN 7:46/iv.46--53) stating that these four meditations are the antidotes, respectively, for sex-ual desire, craving for tastes, attraction to the world, and infatuation with gain, honour, and praise. MA: The elephant look (nilgapalokita) means that without twisting his neck, he turns his whole body in order to look. The Mara DusI did not die because of the Buddha's ele-phant look, but because the evil kamma he generated in wronging a great disciple cut off his life right on the spot. The Great Hell, also called AvIci, is described in greater detail in MN 130.16-19. MA: This feeling, experienced in the auxiliary (ussada) of the Great Hell, is said to be more painful than the feel-ings experienced in the Great Hell itself. The Buddha Kakusandha is called a brahmin in the sense ofMN39.24. The reference is to SN 51:14/v.269-70. See MN 37.11. See MN 37.12. The reference is to SN 6:5/i.145. This verse refers to Yen. Moggallana's mastery over the supernormal power of travelling in space like a bird. SUTIA51 538 From this difference in their manner of greeting the Buddha it is evident that Pessa is a follower of the Buddha, whereas Kandaraka -despite his respect and"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"1250 The Mq.jjhima Nikaya admiration - belongs to a different religious community. 539 MA: Out of respect for the Buddha and because of their training, the bhikkhus did not converse with one anoth-er, nor did they even clear their throats. Unmoving in body, undistracted in mind, they sat surrounding the Blessed One like ruddy clouds surrounding the peak of Mount Sineru. Kandaraka must have been privately com-paring this assembly of the bhikkhus with the assemblies of wanderers as described in MN 76.4. 540 MA explains that Kandaraka did not have direct knowl-edge of the Buddhas of the past and future. He made this statement as a way of expressing his admiration for the well-trained, disciplined, and calm Sangha of bhikkhus. The Buddha, however, confirms this on the basis of direct knowledge. 541 MA: The four foundations of mindfulness are brought in to show the cause for the calm and tranquil deportment of the Sangha. On the foundations of mindfulness, see MN 10. 542 MA glosses: \"We too, when we get an opportunity, from time to time attend to this; we are also practitioners; we do not completely neglect meditation.\" 543 The point of this statement is that an animal's guile and trickery is very limited, while that of human beings is inexhaustible. 544 MA explains that this passage is introduced as a sequel to Pessa's statement that the Blessed One knows the wel-fare and harm of beings; for the Buddha shows that the first three kinds of persons are practising in harmful ways, while the fourth is practising in a beneficial way. The passage can also be connected with Kandaraka's praise of the Sangha; for the Buddha will show three ways in which he does not train the Sangha and the one way in which all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future train their Sanghas. 545 Sukhapatisamvedr brahmabhutena attanil. MA: He experi-ences the bliss of the jhanas, paths, fruits, and Nibbana. \"Brahma\" here should be understood in the sense of holy or excellent (settha). 546 MA: Pessa would have attained the fruit of stream-entry, but he rose from his seat and left before the Buddha had 547 548 549 Notes to Suttas 51 and 52 1251 completed his discourse. The benefits he did receive are two: h~ gained greater confidence in the Sangha, and he gave rIse to a new method for comprehending the foun-dations of mindfulness. This passage ~etails ~he austerities undertaken by many of the. Buddh~ s ascetic contemporaries, as well as by the BodhIsatta hImself during his period of striving for enlightenment. See MN 12.45. This passage shows the practice of one who torments himself in the hope of gaining merit and then offers sacri-fices that involve the slaughter of many animals and the oppression of his workers. This is the arahant. To show clearly that he torments neither himself nor others, the Buddha next undertakes to describe the path of practice by which he arrived at arahantship. SUITA 52 550 551 552 553 All t.hese expressions are descriptive of arahantship. Abhlsankhatam abhisancetayitam. The two terms are fre-quently used in conjunction and indicate a conditioned state in which volition (cetana) is the most prominent conditiOning factor. This passage explains a method for developing \"insight preceded by serenity\" (samathapubbangama vipassana; see ~N 4:170/ ii.157). Having first attained a jhana, the med-Itator emerges from it and contemplates that state as brought into being by conditions, particularly volition. On the basis of this, he ascertains its impermanence, and then contemplates the jhana with insight into the three marks of impermanence, suffering, and non-self.

SUTIA 53 557 It was believed to be a source of merit for those who con-struct a new dwelling to invite an eminent religious per-sonage to dwell in it even for a single night before they inhabit it themselves. This belief still continues in Buddhist lands today, and people who have built a new house for themselves will often invite bhikkhus to hold an all-night recitation of paritta (protective) suttas in their new home before they move in. 558 Sekho patipado. On the sekha, see n.2l. 559 On the distinction between shame (hiri) and fear of wrongdoing (ottappa), see n.416. . 560 Here the text ~xplains sati, mindfulness, by reference to its original meaning of memory. The relationship between the two senses of sati -memory and attentive-ness -may be formulated thus: keen attentiveness to the present forms the basis for an accurate memory of the past. MA takes the mention of sati here to imply all seven factors of enlightenment, among which it is the first. 561 MA: This is the wisdom of insight and of the path, capa-ble of penetrating the rise and fall of the five aggregates. Path wisdom is called \"penetrative\" (nibbedhika) because it pierces through and eradicates the mass of greed, h~te, and delusion; insight wisdom is called penetrative because it pierces through them temporarily and because it leads to penetration by the path. 562 As at MN 16.26. Notes to Suttas 53 and 54 1253 563 This refers to the fourth jhana, which is the foundation for the three knowledges to follow. 564 At this point he ceases to be a sekha and becomes an arahant. 565 These constitute the traditional list of fifteen factors mak-ing up conduct (caralJa), which are often conjoined with the three following types of knowledge in the complete course of training. The two together enter into the common epithet of the Buddha and the arahants, vijja-caraIJasampanna, \"perfect in true knowledge and con-duct.\" See Vsin VII, 30-3l. 566 The verse was approved by the Buddha at DN 3.l.28/i.99. The Brahma Sanankumara, \"Forever Young,\" according to MA was a youth who attained jhana, passed away, and was reborn in the Brahma-world, retaining the same handsome form he possessed in his existence in the human world.

SVITA 54 567 Translated literally the Pali reads simply \"no rapacious greed.\" Since, in the English idiom, it is difficult to see how the mere absence of an evil can serve as a support, I have added the phrase \"refraining from\" here and in the next two cases, which are also expressed as simple nega-tives in the PalL 568 MA: Although the killing of living beings is not included among the ten fetters and five hindrances, it may be called a fetter in the sense of binding one to the round of rebirths and a hindrance in the sense of obstructing one's true welfare. 569 MA: Killing and taking what is not given are to be aban-doned by bodily virtue; false speech and malicious speech, by verbal virtue; rapacious greed, angry despair, and arrogance, by mental virtue.

SUTIA55 573 574 575 JIvaka was the abandoned child of a courtes~n. Discovered and raised by Prince Abhaya, he stud1ed medicine at Takkasila and was later appointed the per-sonal physician of the Buddha. He became a stream-enterer after hearing the Buddha teach the Dhamma .. This passage states clearly and explicitly the regulations on meat-eating laid down by the Buddha for the Sangha. It will be noted that the Buddha does not require the bhikkhus to observe a vegetarian diet, but permits them to consume meat when they are confident that the animal has not been slaughtered especially to provide them with food. Such meat is called tikotiparisuddha, \"pure in three aspects,\" because it is not seen, heard, or suspec~ed to come from an animal killed specifically for the bhikkhu. The lay Buddhist's precept of abstaining fro~ the taking of life would prohibit him from killing for his food, b~t does not proscribe purchasing meat prepared fro~ an1-mals already dead. For more on this issue see Vm Mv Kh 6/i.237-38, and LB. Horner, Early Buddhism and the Taking of Life, pp. 20-26. . . Here the Buddha shows that he does not merely ab1de In loving-kindness by suppressing his ill will with jhana h d· . .ty B runa does, based on loving-kindness, as t e 1Vffil ra . but has eradicated the roots of ill will through his attaIn-ment of arahantship. Notes to Suttas 55 and 56 1255 576 Cruelty, discontent, and aversion (vihesa, arati, pa#gha) are the opposites of compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity respectively. 577 It is puzzling that JIvaka here declares himself a lay fol-lower as if for the first time when he had already been established in stream-entry. Perhaps this formula was used as a means of reaffirming one's dedication to the Triple Gem and was not restricted to an initial profession of going for refuge. SUTIA 56 578 This means \"Tall Ascetic,\" a name given to him because of his height. 579 Da1)qa, originally a stick or staff, acquires the meaning of rod as an instrument of punishment, and subsequently comes to mean punishment or infliction itself, even with-out reference to an instrument. Here the idea seems to be suggested that the Jains regarded bodily, verbal, and mental activity as instruments by which the individual torments himself by prolonging his bondage in samsara and torments others by causing them harm. 580 MA: The Niga1).thas held that the first two \"rods\" create kamma independently of the involvement of the mind (acittaka) just as, when the wind blows, the branches sway and the leaves rustle without any initiative of mind. 581 The Buddha may have said this because in his teaching volition (cetana), a mental factor, is the essential ingredi-ent of kamma, and in its absence -that is, in the case of unintentional bodily or verbal activity -no kamma is created. MA, however, maintains that the Buddha saia this referring to wrong view with fixed consequences (niyata miccha ditthi), and it quotes in support AN 1:18.3/i.33: \"Bhikkhus, I see nothing so blamewor-thy as wrong view. Wrong view is the most blamewor-thy of all things.\" These types of wrong view are described at MN 60.5, 13 and 2l. 582 As at MN 35.5. 583 The parenthe!ical additions in the previous paragraph, inserted by Nm, are supplied from MA. Nm, in Ms,"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"1256 The Majjhima Nikaya sums up the -argument thus~ The NigaIjthas are not allowed to use cold water (because they regard it as contai~ing living beings). By his bodily and verbal refusal of cold water he has kept his bodily and verbal conduct pure, but if he longs in his mind for cold water his mental conduct is impure, and thus he is reborn among the \"mind-bound gods\" (manosatta deva). 584 At §15 Upali admits that at this point he had already acquired confidence in the Buddha. However, he contin-ued to oppose him because he wished to hear the Buddha's varied solutions to the problem. 585 This statement, at DN 2.29/i.57, is ascribed to the Nigru:t~ha Nataputta himself as a formulation of the Jain doctrine. Nm points out in Ms that it may involve a pun on the word vllri, which can mean both \"water\" and \"curb\" (from vllreti, to ward off). In my translation of the Sllmafifiaphala Sutta, The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship, p. 24, I render it based on the Digha commen-tary as follows: \"A Nigru:ttha is restrained with regard to all water; he is endowed with the avoidance of all evil; he is cleansed by the avoidance of all evil; he is suffused with the avoidance of all evil.\" Though the statement conveys a concern for moral purity, the tone is decidedly different from that of the Buddha's teachings. 586 The Buddha points to a contr-adiction between the Jain thesis that, _even in the absence of volition, the \"bodily rod\" is the most reprehensible of all, and their assertion that the presence of volition significantly alters the moral character of an action. 587 See Jat iii.463, v.133ff., 267; v.l44; vi.389, v.267; v.114, 267; Miln 130. 588 MA: Vision of the Dhamma (dhammacakkhu) is the path of stream-entry. The phrase \"All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation\" shows the mode in which the path arises. The path takes cessation (Nibbana) as its object, but its function is to penetrate all conditioned states as subject to arising and cessation. 589 The \"Dhamma\" referred to here is the Four Noble Truths. Having seen these truths for himself, he has cut off the fetter of doubt and now possesses the \"view that Notes to Suttas 56 and 57 1257 is noble and emancipating and (which) leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering\" (MN 48.7). 590 MA: Upali says this referring to the path of stream-entry he had penetrated earlier. 591 See MN 16.3-7. 592 The PIS and SBJ eds. read vessantarassa; the BBS ed. of text and MA read vesamantarassa; MT supports the for-mer reading. MA explains: \"He has transcended the unrighteous state (visama) of lust, etc.\" 593 Monapattassa. The \"silence\" is wisdom, related to muni, silent sage. 594 The \"banner\" is the conceit \"I am.\" See MN 22.35. 595 Nippapaficassa. See n.229. 596 Isisattamassa. MA interprets this to mean \"the seventh seer\" -in line with the brahmanic conception of the seven rishis -and takes it as referring to Gotama's status as the seventh Buddha since VipassI (see DN 14.1.4/ii.2). It is more probable, however, that sattama here is the superlative of sad, and thus that the compound means \"the best of seers.\" The expression isisattama occurs at Sn 356, and the commentary to that verse allows both interpretations, offering uttama as a gloss on sattama. 597 This refers to the absence of attachment and repulsion. 598 Nm translates from a Siamese alternative reading given in the BBS ed., appabhrtassa, pointing out that the PTS ed.'s appahznassa does not make sense here. 599 MA: A heavy sorrow arose in him because of the loss of his lay supporter, and this produced a bodily disorder that resulted in his vomiting hot blood.

Thus here we should understand that the being engages in a medley of wholesome and unwholesome actions, none of which is particularly dominant. 608 MA: This is the volition of the four supramundane paths culminating in arahantship. Although the arahant pe~­forms deeds, his deeds no longer have any kammlC potency to generate new existence or to bring forth results even in the present existence. 609 MA explains that pabbajja, the going forth, is mentioned here only in a loose figure of speech. In actual fact,. he receives the going forth before the probationary penod Notes to Suttas 57-59 1259 and then lives on probation for four months before being entitled to rece~ve upasampada, full admission to the Sangha. 610 MA: The Buddha can decide: \"This person must live on probation, this one need not live on probation.\" SUTIA58 611 Prince Abhaya was a son of King Bimbisara of Magadha, though not the heir to the throne. 612 Both horns of the dilemma devised by the Nigal).tha Nataputta presupposed that the Buddha would give a one-sided answer. Now that a one-sided answer has been rejected, the dilemma becomes inapplicable. 613 The Buddha does not hesitate to rebuke and admonish his disciples when he sees that such speech will promote their welfare. 614 MA says that dhammadhatu (\"element of things\") refers to the Buddha's knowledge of omniscience. Dhamma-dhatu here should not be confused with the same term used to signify the element of mind-objects among the eighteen elements, nor does it bear the meaning of an all-embracing cosmic principle that the term acquires in Mahayana Buddhism. SUTIA59 615 Pancakanga, the carpenter for King Pasenadi of Kosala, was a devoted follower of the Buddha. He reappears in MN 78 and MN 127. 616 The two kinds of feeling are bodily and mental feeling, or (less commonly) the two mentioned by Pancakanga in §3. The three kinds are the three mentioned by Udayin in §3. The five kinds are the faculties of (bodily) pleasure, (men-tal) joy, (bodily) pain, (mental) grief, and equanimity.

The hundred and eight kinds are the previous thirty-six consid-ered as referring to the past, present, and future. 617 MA pOints out that by speaking of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling of the fourth jhana as a kind of pleasure, the Buddha is implicitly endorsing the view put forth by Pancakanga. 618 MA: Both felt pleasure and unfelt pleasure are found (the latter being the pleasure pertaining to the attainment of cessation). The Tathagata describes both as pleasure in the sense that they are without suffering (niddukkhabhliva). SUITA 60 619 MA: The Buddha began by asking this question because the village of Sal a was situated at the entrance to a forest, and many recluses and brahmins of diverse creeds would stay there overnight, expounding their own views and tearing down the views of their opponents. This left the villagers perplexed, unable to commit themselves to a particular teaching. . 620 Apa1].1].akadha;m111ll. MA explains this as a teaching that is uncontradidable, free from ambiguity, definitely accept-able (aviraddho advejjhagllmI ekamsagllhiko). The term also occurs at AN 3:16/i.113 and AN 4:71/ii.76. 621 The three views discussed in §§5, 13 and 21 are called wrong views with fixed evil result (niyatii miccha ditthi). To adhere to them with firm conviction closes off the prospect of a heavenly rebirth and the attainment of lib-eration. For a fuller discussion ~e Bodhi, Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship, pp. 79-83. The examination of these views unfolds according to the following pattern: The Buddha discloses the wrong view A and its antithesis B. Taking up A for examination first, in Ai he shows the pernicious effect of this view on bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. In Aii he proceeds from the judgement that the view is actually wrong and Notes to Sutta 60 1261 elicits additional negative consequences of its adoption. Then in Aiii he shows how a wise person comes to the conclusion that whether or not the view is true, it serves his best interest to reject it. Next, position B is considered. In B.i the Buddha describes the wholesome influence of this view on 'con-duct. In B.ii he elicits additional positive consequences of adopting such a view. And in B.iii he shows how a wise person comes to the conclusion that, irrespective of its actual veracity, it serves his best interest to conduct his affairs as though the view is true. 622 See n.425 for clarification of several expressions used in the formulation of this view. 623 The Pali terms are susflya and dusrlya. Since \"corrupt virtue\" sounds self-contradictory, \"conduct\" has been used in my rendering of the latter expression. Nm had used \"unvirtuousness.\" 624 He has made himself safe (sotthi) in the sense that he will not be subject to suffering in a future existence. However, he is still liable to the types of suffering to be encountered in this existence, which the Buddha is about to mention. 625 Natthikavada, lit. \"the doctrine of non-existence,\" is so called because it denies the existence of an afterlife and of kammic retribut~pn. 626 His undertaking of the incontrovertible teaching \"extends only to one side\" in the sense that he makes himself. ~afe with regard to the next life only on the pre-SUpposItion that there is no afterlife, while if there is an afterlife he loses on both counts. 627 Atthikavada: the affirmation of the existence of an afterlife and of kammic retribution. 628 His undertaking \"extends to both sides\" since he reaps the benefits of his view affirming the afterlife whether or not an afterlife actually exists. 629 This doctrine of non-doing (akiriyavada), in the Samafifiaphala Sutta (DN 2.17/i.52-53), is attributed to Pfira:Q.a Kassapa.

SurrA 61 637 Rahula was the only son of the Buddha, born on the day his father left the palace to seek enlightenment. At the age of seven he was ordained as a novice by Yen. Sari-putta on the occasion of the Buddha's first return visit to Kapilavatthu after his enlightenment. The Buddha declared him the foremost diSciple among those desirous of training. According to MA, this discourse was taught to Rahula when he was seven years old, thus very shortly after his ordination. At MN 147 he attains arahantship after listening to a discourse by the Buddha on the devel-opment of insight. 638 To acknowledge a wrong deed as such, confess it, and undertake restraint for the future leads to growth in the diScipline of the Noble One. See MN 65.13. 639 In this section, however, the phrase \"then you should confess such a bodily action ... and laid it open\" is replaced by the following: \"Then you should be repelled, ashamed, and disgusted by that mental action.

Both Homer in MLS and Nm in Ms missed this variation.

Hence the Buddha framed his advice in terms of contemplating the body as neither a self nor the possession of a self. 642 MA: Yen. Sariputta, Rahula's teacher, gave Rahula this advice unaware that he had already been given different meditation instructions by the Buddha. He was misled by Rahula's cross-legged posture into thinking that he was practising mindfulness of breathing. 643 MA: The Buddha here explains the meditation on the four great elements rather than mindfulness of breathing in order to dispel Rahula's attachment to the body, which had not yet been removed by the brief instruction on the egolessness of material form. See n.329 for explanation of terms requiring comment. 644 Space (ilkasa) is not a primary material element but is classified under derivative material form (upilda rupa). 645 MA: This passage (§13-17) is taught to show the quality of impartiality (tadibhava). . 646 For explami.ti011s of unclear terms in this first tetrad on mindfulness of breathing (§26), see nn.140-142.

SUTfA 63 648 Those who have always wondered about the fate of the monk who almost left the Buddha to satisfy his meta-physical curiosity will be gladdened to know that in his old age Malunkyaputta received a brief discourse on the six sense bases from the Buddha, went off into solitary Notes to Sutta 64 1265 meditation, and attained arahantship. See SN 35:95/ iv.72-76. His verses are at Thag 399-404 and 794-817. SUTIA 64 649 650 651 652 653 654 The five lower fetters (orambhilgiyani samyojanam) are so called because they lead to rebirth in the sense-sphere planes. They are eradicated in their entirety only by the non-returner. MA: The question may be raised: \"When the Buddha had asked about the fetters and the Elder replied in terms of the fetters, why does the Buddha criticise his reply?\" The ~eason is that Malunkyaputta held the view that a person IS fettered by the defilements only at times when they assail him, while at other times he is not fettered by them. The Buddha spoke as he did to show the error in this view. Anuseti tvev'assa sakktiyaditthanusayo. On the anusayas or underlying tendencies, see n.473. In the commentaries the defilements are distinguished as occurring at three levels: the anusaya level, where they remain as mere latent dispositions in the mind; the pariyutthana level, where they rise up to obsess and enslave the mind (referred to in §5 of this discourse); and the vUikkama level, where they motivate unwholesome bodily and ver-bal action. The point of the Buddha's criticism is that the fetters, even when they do not come to active manifesta-tion, continue to exist at the anusaya level so long as they have not been eradicated by the supramundane path.

See MN 52.4 and n.552.

It should be noted that, when the immaterial attainments are made the basis for insight contemplation, the aggre-gate of material form is not included among the objects of insight.

Notes to Sutta 65 1267 SUITA 65 660 This refers to the Buddha's practice of eating a single meal in the forenoon only. According to the Patimokkha, the bhikkhus are prohibited from eating from noon until the following dawn, though the single-session practice is only recommended but not required. 661 MA: He would be worried and anxious whether he could live the holy life for his entire life. 662 His anxiety persisted because he would still have to fin-ish his meal of the remains by noon. 663 This is the rule prohibiting eating outside the proper time limits. See Yin Pac 37/ iv .35. 664 The seven terms used in this section represent a seven-fold classification of noble individuals. They are expli-cated at MN 70.14-21. 665 Both Nm and Homer take sankameyya here to mean that the bhikkhu makes himself a plank, i.e., lies down across the mud. This, however, is contradicted by Bhaddali's negative answer. Thus it would seem more correct to take this verb to mean that he crosses over himself (as the verb literally does mean), in disregard of the Buddha's injunction. MA points out that the Buddha would never give such a command to his disciples, but only says this to emphasise the recalcitrant behaviour of Bhaddali. 666 MA: He maintains himself by a measure of worldly faith and worldly love towards his preceptor and teacher. Because the other bhikkhus help him, he remains in the homeless life and may eventually become a great monk attained to the direct know ledges. 667 This passage refers to the fixed principle that the Buddha does not lay down a training rule until a case arises that requires the promulgation of an appropriate training rule. See Yin Par 1/iii.9-1O. 668 Tasmim thane parinibbayati.

However, in the Vinaya account of the origin of Pac 37 (Vin iv.85) no mention is made of this successive prohibition. To the contrary, the text seems to assume that it is an item of common knowledge that monks should not consume food past noon, and it shows the Buddha laying down the rule against untimely eating with one complete pro-nouncement valid for all meals past noon. The utterance is in what appears to be very colloquial PalL MA explains: If one's mother and father were alive, they would give their son various kinds of food and offer him a place to sleep, and thus he would not have to wan-der about for food at night.

MA: The ordinary man, the stream-enterer, the once-returner, and the non-returner can all be included under the first category (§14), the non-returner bec~ps~ the craving for being still exists in him and thus at$n,~s he can delight in thoughts of worldly enjoyment. The same four can be included in the second category (§15), the ordinary man because he may suppress arisen defile-ments, arouse energy, develop insight, and eradicate defilements by attaining the supramundane path. This type is distinguished from the previous type only by his sluggishness in arousing mindfulness to abandon arisen defilements. Notes to Suttas 66 and 67 1269 677 This is the arahant, who alone has eradicated all the fetters. 678 Here I have departed from Nm in rendering sukha as \"bliss\" rather than \"pleasure\" in order to avoid the awkward-sounding phrases that would result from strict consistency. MA explains the jhanas as nekkhammasukha because they yield the bliss of renouncing sensual plea-sures; as pavivekasukha because they yield the bliss of being secluded from the crowd and from defilements; as upasamasukha because their bliss is for the purpose of quieting down the defilements; and as sambodhasukha because their bliss is for the purpose of attaining enlight-enment. The jhanas themselves, of course, are not states of enlightenment. 679 All states of mind below the fourth jhana are classified as \"the perturbable\" (injita). The fourth jhana and all higher states are called \"the imperturbable\" (aniiijita). See n.1000. 680 MA: It is not fitting to become attached to it with craving, and one should not come to a standstill at this point. 681 The cessation of perception and feeling is not simply one more higher attainment along the scale of concentration, but here implies the full development of insight brought to its climax in arahantship. SUTIA 67 682 Kevatta manne macchavilope. MA gives two explanations: one favours this rendering, the other suggests\" fisherman hauling in fish.\" 683 It was the Brahma Sahampati who entreated the newly enlightened Buddha to teach the Dhamma to the world. See MN 26.20. . 684 MA: In this case Yen. Sariputta erred in not recognising his responsibility, for the Sangha is the responsibility of the two great elders. Thus the Buddha rebuked him but commended Yen. Moggallana, who recognised his responsibility. 685 MA: The Buddha undertook this teaching to show that there are four fears (or dangers, bhaya) in his Dispen-sation. Those who can overcome these four fears will become established in the Dispensation, the others will not become established."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"1270 The Majjhima Nikaya 686 Pali uses two distinct words signifying different types of food: kMdaniya, \"food to be consumed,\" includes all vari-eties of vegetables, nuts, fruits, yams, etc.; bhojanrya, \"fOOd to be eaten,\" includes food made of grain, meat, and fish. Things to be tasted (sayitabba) would include light refreshments. 687 The proper time is from dawn to noon, beyond which only liquids may be drunk. SUTTA 68 688 689 690 691 The \"rapture and pleasure secluded from sensual ~leasures\" signifies the first and second jhanas, \"somethmg more peaceful than that\" the higher jhanas and the four paths.

This refers to the Buddha's ability to discover by clauvoy-ance the states in which his disciples have taken rebirth. Anna: the knowledge attained by the arahant.

MA says that he should apply himself to learning the text and commentary to the Abhidhamma Pitaka and the Vinaya Pitaka. This is clearly anachronistic. On Abhidhamma in the context of the sut-tas, see n.362. Although there is no corresponding body of literature called\" Abhivinaya,\" it seems probable the word refers to a systematic and analytical approach to the study of the Vinaya, perhaps that embedded in the Sutta-vibhanga of the Vinaya Pitaka. MA: This refers to the eight meditative attainmen:-\" .AS a minimum he should become proficient in the prehnunary work of one meditation subject, such as a kasiJ:ta. Notes to Suttas 69 and 70 1271 695 MA: This refers to all the supramundane states. As a mini-mum he should become proficient in one approach to developing insight up to arahantship. SUTTA 70 696 See n.671. In agreement with MN 66.6, MA explains that the Buddha had first prohibited the afternoon meal and then at a later time prohibited the night meal. He did this out of concern for the delicate bhikkhus in the Order, since they might have become fatigued too quickly if both late 697 meals were prohibited simultaneously. In the Vinaya Pitaka, Assaji and Punabbasuka are described as \"unscrupulous and depraved\" monks and 698 699 700 701 702 are shown indulging in various kinds of bad conduct that bring about the corruption of the laity. At Kitagiri an act of banishment was pronounced against them, and their refusal to obey led to the promulgation of Sanghadisesa 13 (Vin iii. 179-84). MA: This statement is made with pOinted reference to pleasure experienced in eating a night meal, which does not conduce to the practice of a monk's duties. MA: The former type of pleasant feeling is the joy based on the household life, the latter the joy based on renuncia-tion. Similarly, the next two sentences refer to the grief and equanimity based, respectively, on the household life and on renunciation. See MN 137.9-15. §§8-1O serve to provide, by appeal to the Buddha's perfect understanding, the grounds for his injunction to abandon all feelings based on the household life and to develop the feelings based on renunciation. . Here follows a sevenfold classification of noble individu-als which categorises them not merely on the basis of their path and fruit attainment -as the more familiar eightfold scheme does -but according to their dominant faculty. Alternative definitions of these seven are offered by Pug 1:30-36/14-15. Ubhatobhagavimufta. MA: He is liliberated-in-both_ways\" because he is liberated from the physical body by the"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"1272 The Majjhima Nikaya immaterial attainments and from the mental body by the path (of arahantship). The Pug definition reads: \"He con-tacts with the body and abides in the eight liberations, and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.\" MA says that the ubhatobhagavimutta includes those who attain arahantship after emerging from one or another of the four immaterial attainments and the one who attains it after emerging from the attainment of cessation. 703 Pafifiavimutta. MA: This includes those who attain ara-hantship either as dry-insight meditators (sukkha-vipassaka) or after emerging from one or another of the four jhanas. The Pug definition merely substitutes the eight liberations for \"those liberations ... transcending forms.\" 704 Kllyasakkhin. MA: This type includes the six individuals -from the one established in the fruit of stream-entry up to the one on the path of arahantship -who first contact the (immaterial) jhanas and subsequently realise Nibbana. MT stresses that one or another of the immaterial attain-ments including cessation is needed to qualify as kayasakkhin. The Pug definition merely substitutes the eight liberations. 705 Ditthipafta. MA says that this type includes the same six individuals included under kayasakkhin -from the stream-enterer to the one on the path of arahantship -but without possession of the immaterial attainments. Pug defines him as one who has understood the Four Noble Truths and who has reviewed and examined with wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata. 706 Saddhavimutta. MA says that this type too includes the same six. Pug defines him in the same way as it defines the ditthipatta, but adds that he has not reviewed and examined the teachings with wisdom to the same extent that the ditthipatta has. 707 MA says that this type, the dhammanusarin, and the next, the saddhllnusarin, are individuals on the path of stream-entry, the former with predominance of wisdom, the lat-ter with predominance of faith. For more on these two types, see n.273. 708 MA: With the mental body he realises Nibbana, the ultimate truth, and he penetrates it with the wisdom pertaining to the supramundane path. Notes to Suttas 70 and 71 1273 709 That is, these bhikkhus have not had the faith required to undertake the training laid down for them by the Buddha. 710 MA says that the \"four-phrased statement\" (catuppadam veyyakara1J.am) is the teaching of the Four Noble Truths. However, no mention is made here of the four truths. 711 MA: By this the Buddha shows that the ideal disciple practises by arousing his energy and resolving: \"I shall not rise up so long as I have not attained arahantship.\" SUTTA 71 712 This sutta and the following two seem to present a chronological account of Vacchagotta's spiritual evolu-tion. The Samyutta Nikaya contains a whole section of short discussions between the Buddha and Vacchagotta, SN 33/iii.257-62. See also SN 44:7-11/iv.391-402. 713 This is the type of omniscience that the Jain teacher the Nigar:ttha Nataputta claims at MN 14.17. 714 MA explains that even though part of the statement is valid, the Buddha rejects the entire statement because of the portion that is invalid. The part of the statement that is valid is the assertion that the Buddha is omniscient and all-seeing; the part that is excessive is the assertion that knowledge and vision are continuously present to him. According to the Theravada tradition the Buddha is omniscient in the sense that all knowable things are potentially accessible to him. He cannot, however, know everything simultaneously and must advert to whatever he wishes to know. At MN 90.8 the Buddha says that it is pOSSible to know and see all, though not Simultaneously, and at AN 4:24/ii.24 he claims to know all that can be seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, which is understood by the Theravada tradition as an assertion of omniscience in the qualified sense. See too in this connection Miln 102-7. 715 MA explains \"the fetter of householdership\" (gihisam-yojana) as attachment to the requisites of a householder, which MT details as land, ornaments, wealth, grain, etc. MA says that even though the texts mention some indi-viduals who attained arahantship as laymen, by the path"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"1274 The MajjhinUl Nikiiya of arahantship they destroyed all attachment to worldly things and thus either went forth as monks or passed away inunediately after their attainment. The question of lay arahants is discussed at Miln 264. 716 On the AjIvakas see MN 5.5. 717 Since this AjIvaka believed in the moral efficacy of action, he could not have subscribed to the orthodox philosophi-cal fatalism of the Ajlvakas, which denied the effective role of kamma and volitional deeds in modifying human destiny. MA identifies this AjIvaka with the Bodhisatta in a previous birth. SUITA 72 718 719 720 721 The view that the soul VIVa) and the body are the same is materialism, which reduces the soul to the body. The fol-lowing view that the soul and the body are different is an eternalist view, which regards the soul as a persisting spiri-tual principle that can exist independently of the body. The view that a Tathagata exists after death is a form of eternalism that regards the Tathagata, or spiritually per-fect individual, as possessing a self that attains eternal deliverance after the death of the body. The view that a Tathagata does not exist after death also identifies the Tathagata as self, but holds that this self is annihilated upon the death of the body. The third view attempts a synthesis of these two, which the Buddha rejects beca~se both components involve a wrong view. The fourth VIew seems to be a sceptical attempt to reject both alternatives or to avoid taking a definite stand. In the Pali a word play is involved between ditfhigata, \"speculative view,\" which the Tathagata has put away, and dittha, what has been \"seen\" by the Tathagata with direct vision, namely, the rise and fall of the five aggregates. . MA says that \"does not reappear\" actually does apply,.w the sense that the arahant does not undergo a new eXIS-tence. But if Vacchagotta were to hear this he would mis-apprehend it as annihilationism, and thus the Buddha denies that it applies in the sense that annihilation is not a tenable position. Notes to Suttas 72 and 73 1275 722 MA says this is the material form by which one would describe the Tathagata as a being (or self) possessing material form. MT adds that the material form has been abandoned by the abandonment of the fetters connected with it, and it has thus become incapable of arising again in the future. 723 This passage should be connected with the simile of the extinguished fire. Just as the extinguished fire cannot be described as having gone to any direction, so the Tathagata who has attained to final Nibbana cannot be described in terms of the four alternatives. The simile con-cerns solely the legitimacy of conceptual and linguistic usage and is not intended to suggest, as some scholars have held, that the Tathagata attains to some mystical absorption in the Absolute. The words \"profound, immea-surable, unfathomable\" point to the transcendental dimension of the liberation attained by the Accomplished One, its inaccessibility to discursive thought. SUITA 73 724 This question and the next refer to arahantship, which (according to MA) Vacchagotta thought may have been an exclusive prerogative of the Buddha. 725 This question refers to the non-returner. Even though the non-returner may remain in the lay life, he necessarily observes celibacy because he has cut off the fetter of sen-sual desire. 726 This question refers to the stream-enterer and the once-returner, who may still indulge in sensual pleasures if they remain in the lay life. 727 MA: He had attained the fruit of the non-returner and came to ask the Buddha about the practice of insight for attaining the path of arahantship. However, the Buddha saw that he had the supporting conditions for the six direct knowledges. Thus he taught him serenity for pro-ducing the five mundane direct know ledges and insight for reaching arahantship. 728 The suitable basis (ayatana) is the fourth jhana for the five direct know ledges and insight for arahantship."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"1276 The Majjhima Nikliya 729 Paricilflfo me Bhagava, paricilflfo me Sugato. This is an indi-rect way of informing the Buddha of his attain~ent of arahantship. The bhikkhus did not understand this, and therefore the Buddha interprets its significance for them. SUTTA 74 730 731 732 733 Dlghanakha was Yen. Sariputta's nephew. At the ti~e he approached the Buddha, Sariputta had been a bhIkkhu for only two weeks and was still a stream-enterer. MA holds that DIghanakha is an annihilationist (ucche-davadin) and explains this assertion to mean: \"No [mode of} rebirth is acceptable to me.\" However, the text itself does not give any concrete evidence supporting this interpretation. It seems much more likely that Dlgha-nakha's statement, \"Nothing is acceptable to me\" (sabbam me na khamati), is intended to apply specifically to other philosophical views, and thus shows DIghanakha .to be a radical sceptic of the class satirically charactensed at MN 76.30 as \"eel-wrigglers\". His assertion would then be tantamount to a wholesale repudiation of all philosophi-cal views. This exchange, as interpreted by MA and MT, should be understood as follows: The Buddha suggests, by his question, that O1ghanakha's assertion involves ~n ~er­ent contradiction. For he cannot reject everythmg WIth-out also rejecting his own view, and this would entail the opposite position, namely, that something is ac~eptable to him. However, though Dlghanakha recogmses the implication of the Buddha's question, he con.tinues to insist on his view that nothing is acceptable to him. MA says that the first sentence refers to those who first take up a basic etemalist or annihilationist view and ~e~ subsequently adopt secondary variations on that VIe,:, the second sentence refers to those who abandon theIr basic view without adopting an alternative. But if, as seems plausible, DIghanakha was a radical sceptic,. then the Buddha's statement might be understood to pomt t~ an unsatisfactoriness inherent in the sceptic's position: It 734 735 736 737 738 739 Notes to Sutta 74 1277 ~s psychologically uncomfortable to insist on remaining ill the dark. Thus most sceptics, while profeSSing a rejec-tion of all views, surreptitiously adopt some definite view, while a few abandon their scepticism to seek a path to personal knowledge. MA identifies the three views here as etemalism, annihi-latibnism, and partial etemalism. The etemalist view is close to lust (saragaya santike), etc., because it affirms and delights in existence in however sublimated a form' annihilationism is close to non-lust, etc., because, though involving a wrong conception of self, it leads to disen-chantment with existence. If the second view is under-stood as radical scepticism, it could also be seen as close to non-lust in that it expresses disillusionment with the attempt to buttress the attachment to existence with a theoretical foundation and thus represents a tentative, though mistaken, step in the direction of dispassion. MA: This teaching is undertaken to show Dlghanakha the danger in his view and thereby encourage him to discard it. MA: At this point Dlghanakha has discarded his annihi-lationist view. Thus the Buddha now undertakes to teach him insight meditation, first by way of the imperma-nence of the body and then by way of the impermanence of the mental factors under the heading of feeling. MA quotes a verse that says that an arahant may use the words \"I\" and \"mine\" without giving rise to conceit or misconceiving them as referring to a self or ego (SN 1:5/i.l4). See too DN 9.53/i.202, where the Buddha says of expressions employing the word \"self\": \"These a.re m~rely names, expressions, turns of speech, designa'-hons ill common use in the world, which the Tathagata uses without misapprehending them.\" MA: Having reflected on the discourse spoken to his nephew, Yen. Sariputta developed insight and attained arahantship. DIghanakha attained the fruit of stream-entry.

In Ms, Nm had rendered this cryptic expres-sion \"a wrecker of being.\" I follow Homer in translating after the commentarial gloss hatavaqqhino mariyadakara-kassa. MA explains that he held the view that \"growth\" should be accomplished in the six senses by experiencing whatever sense objects one has never experienced before without clinging to those that are already familiar. His view thus seems close to the contemporary attitude that intensity and variety of experience is the ultimate good and should be pursued without inhibitions or restric-tions. The reason for his disapproval of the Buddha will become clear in §8. His father, the king, had provided him with three palaces and the entourage of women in hopes of keeping him confined to the lay life and distracting him from thoughts of renunciation. MA: This is said referring to the attainment of the fruit of arahantship based on the fourth jhana. The expression viparltasafifia alludes to the \"perverted perception\" (safifiavipallasa) of perceiving pleasure in what is really painful. MT says that sensual pleasures are painful because they arouse the painful defilements and because they yield painful fruits in the future. Homer misses'the point by translating the line \"(they may) receive a change of sensation and think it pleas-ant\" (MLS 2:187). Magandiya evidently understands the verse in line with the fifty-eighth wrong view of the ~rahm~jala Su~ta: \"When this self, furnished and supplIed WIth the fIve strands of sense pleasures, revels in them -at this point the self attains supreme Nibbana here and noW\" (ON 1.3.20/i.36). . MA: The full verse had been recited by the prevIOUS Buddhas seated in the midst of their fourfold assemblies. The multitude learned it as \"a verse concerned with the good.\" After the last Buddha passed away, it spread among the wanderers, who were able to preserve only the first two lines in their books. Notes to Suttas 75 and 76 1279 746 The emphatic yeva, \"just,\" implies that he was clinging to material form, feeling\" etc., misconceived to be \"I,\" \"mine,\" and \"my self.\" With the arising of vision - a metaphorical expression for the path of stream-entry -personality view is eradicated and he understands the aggregates to be mere empty phenomena devoid of the selfhood that he had earlier imputed to them. 747 \"These\" refers to the five aggregates. SurrA 76 748 Tiracchanakatha. Many translators render this expression as \"animal talk.\" However, tiracchana means literally \"going horizontally,\" and though this term is used as a designation for animals, MA explains that in the present context it means talk that goes \"horizontally\" or \"perpen-dicularly\" to the path leading to heaven and liberation. 749 The \"four ways that negate the living of the holy life\" (abrahmacariyavasa, lit. \"ways that are not living the holy life\") are teachings that in principle nullify the prospect of attaining the ultimate fruits of spiritual discipline. As the sutta will show, their proponents -inconsistently with their own principles -did observe celibacy and practise austerities. The \"four kinds of holy life without consolation\" (anassllsikani brahmacariyllni) do not under-mine the principles of the holy life, but they also fail to offer the prospect of attaining the ultimate fruits of spiri-tual discipline. 750 The following passage makes explicit the materialist premises of the nihilistic view already set forth at MN 60.7. The Samafifiaphala Sutta ascribes this view t'o Ajita Kesakambalin (ON 2.23/i.55). 751 The point seems to be that even if one does not live the holy life, one ultimately reaps the same rewards as one who does, as the rest of the passage will make clear. 752 In the Samafifiaphala Sutta the view that follows, as far as \"the space between the seven bodies,\" is ascribed to Pakudha Kaccayana (ON 2.26/i.56). However, in that sutta the following passage on the elaborate system of classifications, down to \"fools and the wise both will"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"1280 The Majjhima Nikaya 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 make an end of suffering,\" is connected with the view of non-causality and follows immediately upon the state-ment of the doctrine of non-causality set forth in this sutta at §13. The entire view is there assigned to Makkhali Gosala. Since there are evident connections between the non-causality doctrine and items in the sys-tem of classifications (e.g., the reference to the \"six class-es\"), and since both are known to have been typical of the AjIvaka movement headed by Makkhali Gosala, it seems that the inclusion of this system of classifications here under the doctrine of the seven bodies came about through an error of oral transmission. The correct version would thus be the one preserved by the DIgha Nikaya. For the commentary on the system of classification, see Bodhi, The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship, pp. 72-77. This statement reaffirms the fatalistic view of liberation enunciated in §13. This is the claim made by the Jain teacher the Nigax:ttha Nataputta at MN 14.17, and both the latter and PfuaQ.a Kassapa at AN 9:38/iv.428-29. The fact that he makes bad judgements and must ask questions belies his claim to omniscience. MA: This position is called eel-wriggling (amaravikkhepa) because the doctrine roams about here and there, like an eel diving in and out of the water, and thus it is impossible to catch hold of'it. In the Samafifiaphala Sutta this position is ascribed to Safijaya Belatthiputta (DN 2.32/1.58-59). It is quite possible that the \"eel-wrigglers\" were a class of rad-ical sceptics who questioned the entire prospect of apod-ictic knowledge about ultimate issues. MA: He is incapable of storing up food provisions and other pleasurable goods and subsequently enjoying them. At DN 29.26/iii.133 four other things that the arahant cannot do are mentioned: he cannot take a wrong course of action because of desire, hatred, fear, or delusion. The translation of this passage follows the BBS ed. Niyyataro: Nm had rendered this as \"guides,\" Homer. as \"great leaders.\" Evidently both followed PED, which takes niyyatar to be an agent noun related to niyyama(ka), pilot or helmsman. But niyyatar must be an agent noun of Notes to Suttas 76 and 77 1281 760 the verb niyyati, \"to go out (to final emancipation),\" and thus it has been rendered here as \"emancipated one.\" On these three mentors of the A.jlvakas, see MN 36.5 and n.383. MA explains the phrase puttamataya putta, \"moth-,:r's dead sons,\" thus: The idea occurred to him, \"The Ajlvakas are dead; their mother had dead sons.\" SurrA 77 761 Anagatam vadapatham. Nm had translated: \"a future logi-cal consequence of an assertion.\" The meaning seems to be that the Buddha understands all the unexpressed implications of his own doctrine as well as of his oppo-nents' doctrines. The phrase may also imply that, in such suttas as the Brahmajala Sutta, the Buddha has laid down a critique applicable to any doctrine that might arise in the future course of religio-philosophical thought. Explained in full in MN 10. The first seven groups of \"wholesome states\" (§§15-21) constitute the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma). Abhififiavosanaparamippatta. MA explains as the attain-ment of arahantship. This may be the only sense that the word paramr bears in its appearance in the four Nikayas. In the later Theravada literature, beginning perhaps with such works as the Buddhavamsa, this word comes to signify the perfect virtues that a bodhisatta must fulfil over many lives in order to attain BUddhahood. In that context it corresponds to the paramita of the Mahayana literature, though the numerical lists of virtues overlap only in part. 762 763 764 MA explains liberation (vimokkha) here as meaning the mind's full (but temporary) release from the opposing states and its full (but temporary) release by delighting in the object. The first liberation is the attainment of the four jha.nas using a kasiI).a (see §24 and n.768) derived from a coloured object in one's own body; the second is the attainment of the jhanas using a kasit:ta derived from an external object; the third can be understood as the attainment of the jhanas through either a very pure and beautiful coloured kasiI).a or the four brahmavihiiras. The"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"1282 The Majjhima Nikaya remaining liberations are the immaterial attainments and the attainment of cessation. 765 MA explains that these are called bases of transcendence (abhibhayatana) because they transcend (abhibhavati, over-come) the opposing states and the objects, the former through the application of the appropriate antidote, the latter through the arising of knowledge. 766 MA: The meditator does the preliminary work on an internal form - e.g., the blue of the eyes for a blue-kas~a, the skin for a yellow kas~a, the blood for a red-kas~a, the teeth for a white-kas~a -but the sign of concentra-tion (nimitta) arises externally. The \"transcending\" of the forms is the attainment of absorption together with the arising of the sign. The perception \"I know, I see\" is the advertence (abhoga) that occurs after he emerges from the attainment, not within the attainment. The second base of transcendence differs from the first only by the extension of the sign from limited to unlimited dimensions. 767 MA: The second and fourth bases involve preliminary work done on an external form and the arising of the sign externally. The fifth through eighth bases differ from the third and fourth in the superior purity and lumin-osity of their colours. 768 The kas~a is a meditation object derived from a physical device that provides a support for acquiring the inward-ly visualiseq sigh. Thus, for example, a disk made of clay can be used as the preliminary object for practising the earth-kasiI:ta, a bowl of water for practising the water-kas~a. The kas~as are explained in detail in Vsm IV and V. There, however, the space-kas~a is restricted to limit-ed space, and the consciousness-kas~a is replaced by the light-kas~a. 769 The similes for the jhanas also appear in MN 39, as do the similes for the last three types of knowledge at §§34-36. 770 §§29-36 describe eight varieties of higher knowledge which, in the Samaiiiiaphala Sutta, are designated superior fruits of recluseship. Notes to Sutta 78 1283 SVITA 78 771 MA: The park had been built by Queen Mallika the wife of King Pasenadi of Kosala, and beautified wi;h flower tre~s and fruit trees. At first only one hall was built, which a~count~ for its name, but afterwards many halls were bUIlt. Vanous companies of brahmins and wander-ers would assemble here to expound and discuss their doctrines. 772 MA: First the Buddha shows the plane of the arahant, the ~ne beyond training (i.e., by mentioning the ten quali-ties), then he sets up an outline applicable to the sekha the diSciple in higher training.

MA will also explain the subsequent passages by reference to the other supra-mundane paths and fruits.

The commentary's view is further supported by the culmination of the entire discourse in the figure of the arahant. 774 MA: As far as the path of stream-entry he is said to be pr~ctising for their cessation; when he has attained the frUIt of stream-entry they are said to have ceased. 775 This passage shows the arahant, who maintains virtuous co~~uct. but no longer identifies with his virtue by con-celYmg It as \"I\" and \"mine.\" Since his virtuous habits no longer generate kamma, they are not describable as \"wholesome. \" 776 MA: !\"'.s far as the path of arahantship he is said to be pr~chsmg for their cessation; when he has attained the frUIt of arahantship they are said to have ceased."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"1284 The Majjhima Nikiiya 777 778 779 780 MA: This refers to the first jhana pertaining to the fruit of non-returning.

The VIr-tuous intentions of the arahant are not described as \"wholesome.\" 781 See MN 65.34. SUITA 79 782 783 784 See n.408. Evamvanno atta hoti arogo param maratfa. The word arogo, normally· meaning healthy, here should be understood to mean permanent. MA says that he speaks with reference to rebirth in the heavenly world of Refulgent Glory, the objective counterpart of the third jhaita, of which he has heard without actually attaining it. His view would seem to fall into the class described at MN 102.3. Previous translators seem to have been perplexed by the verb anassama. Thus Nm in Ms renders the line: \"W~ don't renounce our teachers' doctrines for this reason. And Horner: \"We have heard to here from our own teachers.\" But anassama is a first-person plural aorist of nassati, \"to perish, to be lost.\" The same for~ occurs at MN 27.7. MA explains that they knew that In the ~ast meditators would do the preparatory work on the kasn::ta, attain the third jhana, and be reborn in the world of Refulgent Glory. But as time went on, the preparato~i­work on the kasiJ::la was no longer understood and me tators were not able to attain the third jhana. The wan:, derers only learned that \"an entirely pleasant world Notes to Suttas 79-81 1285 785 exists and that the five qualities mentioned at §21 were the \"practic~l way\" to it. They knew of no entirely pleas-ant w~rld hIgher than the third jhana, and of no practical way higher than the five qualities. MA: Having attained the fourth jhana, by supernormal power he goes to the world of Refulgent Glory and con-verses with the deities there. 786 ~ explains that in a previous life, as a monk during the tIme of the Buddha Kassapa, he had persuaded another monk to return to lay life in order to gain his robes and bo~l, and this obstructive kamma prevented him from gOIng forth under the Buddha in this life. But the Buddha taught him two long suttas to provide him with a condi-tion for futur: attainment. During the reign of King Asoka he att~Ined arahantship as the Elder Assagutta, who excelled In the practice of loving-kindness. SUTTA 80 787 788 MA identifies Vekhanassa as Sakuludayin's teacher. !\"fA: Even though he was a wanderer, he was keenly Intent on sensual pleasures. The Buddha undertook this teaching in order to make him recognise his strong con-cern with sensual pleasures, and thus the discourse would be beneficial to him. 789 In the Pali this sentence takes the form of a riddle, and the translation here is conjectural. MA explains that the \"pleasure higher than the sensual\" (or \"the highest sen-sual pleasure,\" kiimaggasukham) is Nibbana. SUITA 81 790 791 At the end of this sutta the Buddha will state that at that time he himself was Jotipala. At SN 1:50/i,35-36 the deity Ghatlkara visits the Buddha Gotama and recalls their ancient friendship. This seems to have been a common pejorative expression used by the brahmin householders with reference to thos~ who led a full-time renunciate life, contrary to their own Ideal of maintaining the family lineage."},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"1286 The Majjhima Nikaya 792 In the East it is considered, under normal circumstances, a serious breach of etiquette for one of lower birth to touch one of superior birth on the head. MA explains that Ghatlkara was prepared to risk that breach in order to persuade Jotipala to meet the Buddha. 793 MA states that bodhisattas go forth under the Buddhas, purify their virtue, learn the Buddha's teachings, practise the meditative life, and develop insight up to conformity knowledge (anulomanalJa). But they do not make effort to attain the paths and fruits (which would terminate their bodhisatta career). 794 His conduct approximates as closely to that of a monk as is possible for one still leading the household life. MA explains that he does not trade in the pottery he makes but merely engages in a free exchange of services with his neighbours. 795 MA explains that he refused because of his fewness of wishes (appicchnta). He realised that the king had sent the foodstuffs because he had heard the Buddha's report about his own virtues, but he thought: \"1 have no need of this. With what I acquire through my work I can sup-port my parents and make offeriI).gs to the Buddha.\" SlJITA 82 796 797 798 799 Because of his readiness to risk death in order to obtain his parents' permission to go forth, he was later declared by the Buddha the foremost of those gone forth in faith. His verses are at Thag 769-93. Although the stock phrase \"before long\" is used here, MA says that it took Ratthapala twelve years of striv~g to attain arahantship. This statement seems correct in view of the fact that on his return journey to his parents' home his father did not immediately recognise him. Abhidosikam kummlisam. Elsewhere Nm translated kummasa as \"bread,\" but here it obviously means some-thing of a semi-liquid nature. MA says it is made from barley (yava). _ MA explains that his father meant to say: \"Ratthapala, my dear, there is our wealth -we cannot be called poor -800 801 802 803 804 805 Notes to Suttas 82 and 83 1287 yet you sit in such a place eating old porridge!\" However, the householder was afflicted with such sor-row that he was unable to complete his utterance. The verses obviously refer to his former wives, adorned in order to entice him back to the lay life. Strangely, no mention is made of the wives in the portion of the sutta conceived in his pre-ordination days. MA: Recalling the Elder, the king would speak praise of him in the midst of his army or his harem: \"That young man has done a difficult thing - haVing abandoned great wealth, he went forth without turning back or looking aside.\" Upantyati loko addhuvo. MA: It is swept away towards ageing and death. Atta1J-o loko anabhissaro. MA: There is no one able to offer it shelter or to console it with a refuge. This statement, of course, does not deny a refuge from the world, which is just what the Dhamma offers. ~ssako loko sabbam pahaya gamantyam. Uno loko atitto ta1J-hadaso. SurrA 83 806 See Makhadeva lataka (No.9) and Nimi liitaka (No. 54). King Makhadeva and King Nimi were earlier births of the Buddha Gotama. 807 The grove was originally planted by Makhadeva and thus was still named after him. 808 MA: He was established in the ten wholesome courses of action. 809 The Uposatha is the religious observance day of ancient India, also absorbed as such into Buddhism. See n.59. . 810 According to Buddhist cosmology, the lifespan of human beings oscillates between a minimum of ten years and a maximum of many thousands of years. Makhadeva lived at a time when the lifespan was at the long end of the spectrum. 811 On the \"divine messengers\" -the foretokens of old age, illness, and death - see MN 130. 812 MA: Matali led him first through the hells, then he turned back and led him through the heavenly world."},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"1288 The Majjhima Nikaya 813 MA: The good practice is being broken by a virtuous bhikkhu when he thinks, \"1 cannot obtain arahantship\" and does not exert energy.

SUTIA 84 814 See n.230. 815 From this passage it seems that despite a tendency to rigidification, the Indian class system was at the time considerably more elastic than the later caste system that evolved from it. SUTIA 85 816 • Prince Bodhi was the son of King Udena of Kosambl; his mother was the daughter of King CaQ.Q.appajjota of A vantI. The portion of the sutta from §2 through §8 is also found at Yin Cv Kh 5/ii.127-29, where it leads to the formulation of the rule mentioned in the following note. 817 MA explains that Prince Bodhi was childless and desired a son. He had heard that people can fulfil their wishes by making special offerings to the Buddha, so he spread the white cloth with the idea: \"If I am to have a son, the Buddha will step on the cloth; if I am not to have a son, he will not step on the cloth.\" The Buddha knew that by reason of past evil kamma, he and his wife were destined to remain childless. Hence he did not step on the cloth. Later he laid down a disciplinary rule prohibiting the bhikkhus from stepping on a white cloth, but subse-quently modified the rule to allow bhikkhus to step on a cloth as a blessing for householders. . 818 Pacchimariz janatariz Tathagato apaloketi. The Yin versl~n here reads anukampati, \"has compassion,\" which. IS preferable. MA explainS that Yen. Ananda said this WIth the thought in mind: \"In later times people will come to regard honour to the bhikkhus as a way of ensurin? t~e fulfilment of their mundane wishes and will lose faIth In Notes to Suttas 85 and 86 1289 the Sangha if their dIsplays of honour do not bring the success they desire.\" 819 This is the basic tenet of the Jains, as at MN 14.20. SUTTA 86 820 The name\" Angulimala\" is an epithet meaning \"garland (mala) of fingers (angulz).\" He was the son of the brahmin Bhaggava, a chaplain to King Pasenadi of Kosala. His given name was Ahi.ri1.saka, meaning \"harmless one.\" He studied at Takkasila, where he became his teacher's favourite. His fellow students, jealous of him, told the teacher that Ahimsaka had committed adultery with his wife. The teacher, intent on bringing Ahirilsaka to ruin, commanded him to bring him a thousand human right-hand fingers as an honorarium. Ahimsaka lived in the Jalinl forest, attacking travellers, cutting off a finger of each, and wearing them as a garland around his neck. At the time the sutta opens he was one short of a thousand and had made a determination to kill the next person to come along. The Buddha saw that Angulimala's mother was on her way to visit him, and aware that Angulimala had the supporting conditions for arahantship,he inter-cepted him shortly before his mother was due to arrive. 821 MA explains that Angulimala had just realised that the monk before him was the Buddha himself and that he had come to the forest for the express purpose of trans-forming him. 822 MA: By virtue of his merit from past lives, Angulimala acquired the bowl and robes through the spiritual power of the Buddha as soon as the Buddha said, \"Come, bhikkhu.\" 823 Even today this utterance is often recited by Buddhist monks as a protective charm (paritta) for pregnant women close to their time of delivery. 824 MA explains that any volitional action (kamma) is capable of yielding three kinds of result: a result to be experi-enced here and now, i.e., in the same life in which the deed is committed; a result to be experienced in the next"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"1290 The Majjhima Nikaya existence; and a result to b~ experienced in any life sub-sequent to the next, as long as one's sojourn in samsara continues. Because he had attained arahantship, Angulimala had escaped the latter two types of result but not the first, since even arahants are susceptible to expe-riencing the present-life results of actions they performed before attaining arahantship. 825 Several of the verses to follow also appear in the Dhammapada. Angulimala's verses are found in full at Thag 866-91. 826 Although MA says that Ahimsaka, \"Harmless,\" was Angulimala's given name, the commentary to the Theragatha says his original name was Himsaka, mean-ing \"dangerous.\" 827 Whereas virtuous bhikkhus short of arahants are said to eat the country's almsfood as an inheritance from the Buddha, the arahant eats \"free from debt\" because he has made himself fully worthy of receiving alms. See Vsm I, 125-27. SUITA 87 828 The expression is often used to mean serious illness and death. 829 Vi<;il1<;iabha wa,s the king's son, who eventuall~ over-threw him. Kasi and Kosala are lands over WhICh the king ruled. 830 MA: He used this to wash his hands and feet and clean his mouth before saluting the Buddha. SUTIA88 831 MA explains that the king asked this question with refer-ence to the case involving the female wanderer Sundarl, which was pending investigation at the time. Wishing to discredit the Buddha, some wandering ascetics persuaded SundarI to visit Jeta's Grove at night and then let herself be seen returning at dawn, so people would become suspi-cious. After some time they had her murdered and buried Notes to Suttas 88 and 89 1291 near Jeta's Grove, and when her body was discovered there, they pointed an accusing finger at the Buddha. After a week the false report was exposed when the king's spies found out the real story behind the murder. See Ud 4:8/42-45. 832 Briefly, this passage offers five criteria of evil actions: unwholesomeness underscores the psychological quality of the action, its unhealthy effect upon the mind; its being blameworthy underscores its morally detrimental nature; its capacity to produce painful results calls attention to its undesirable kammic potential; and the last statement calls attention to both its evil motivation and the harmful long-rang~ consequences such action entails for both one-self and others. The opposite explanation applies to good action, discussed in §14. 833 MA: Yen. Ananda's answer goes beyond the question, for he shows not only that the Buddha praises the aban-doning of all unwholesome states, but that he acts in accordance with his word by having abandoned all unwholesome states as well. 834 MA explains the word bahitika, after which the sutta is named, as a cloak produced in a foreign country. SUTIA89 835 Dlgha KarayaDa was the commander-in-chief of King Pasenadi's forces. He was the nephew of Bandhula, chief of the Mallas and a former friend of King Pasenadi, whom the king had killed together with his thirty-two so~~ through the treacherous contrivance of his corrupt mlnlsters. Karaya.t:ta was in secret collusion with Prince Vi<;il1<;iabha, Pasenadi's son, to help the latter usurp his father's throne. 836 Three leagues (yojana) would be approximately twenty miles. 837 MA says that he thought: \"Previously, after conferring in private with the recluse Gotama, the king arrested my uncle and his thirty-two sons. Perhaps this time he will arrest me.\" The royal insignia entrusted to Dlgha"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"1292 The Majjhi11J-a Nikilya Karayat:La also included the fan, parasol, and sandals. Dlgha Karayat:La hurried back to the capital with the royal insignia and crowned Vi<;iu<;iabha king. 838 At MN 13.11 these quarrels are said to arise because of sensual pleasures. 839 As at MN 77.6. 840 As at MN 27.4-7. 841 At the time of their deaths both were declared by the Buddha to be once-returners. See AN 6:44/ iii.348. 842 This statement indicates that this sutta can be assigned to the last year of the Bq.ddha's life. 843 When King Pasenadi returned to the place where he had left Dlgha Karayat:La, he found only a servant woman who reported the news to him. He then hurried on to Rajagaha to enlist the aid of his nephew, King Ajatasattu. But since he arrived late, he found the city gates closed. Exhausted by the journey, he lay down in a hall outside the city and died during the night. 844 MA: \"Monuments to the Dhamma\" means words expressing reverence to the Dhamma. Whenever rever-ence is shown towards any of the Three Jewels, it is also shown to the others. SlJITA 90 845 MA: These two sisters are the king's wives (not his sisters!). 846 MA: There is no one who can know and see all - past, present, and future -with one act of mental adverting, with one act of consciousness; thus this problem is dis-cussed in terms of a single act of consciousness (ekacitta). On the question of the kind of omniscience the Thera-vada tradition attributes to the Buddha, see n.714. 847 That is, he is not inquiring about their social status but about their prospects for spiritual progress and attainment. 848 As at MN 85.58. 849 MA's explanation of this reply suggests that the former class of gods are non-returners, while the latter class are gods who have not attained the status of non-returne~s. The same would apply to the question on Brahmas U1 §15. The two key terms that here distinguish the tWO Notes to Suttas 90 and 91 1293 types of gods appear in the PTS ed. as savyiipajjha and abyiipajjhii, which would be rendered as \"subject to ill will\" and \"free from ill will,\" respectively. The BBS ed. reading accepted here, sabyiibajjhii and abyllbajjhii, has the support of MA, which glosses the former as \"who have not abandoned mental suffering by eradicating it,\" and the latter as \"who have eradicated suffering.\" As either reading would be applicable to non-returners, no signifi-cant difference is entailed. Note that the word itthatta which in the stock declaration of arahantship signifie~ any state of manifest existence, is here glossed by MA as manussaloka, the human world. SUTIA 91 850 This is a stock description of a learned brahmin. According to MA, the Three Vedas are the 1ru, Yaju, and Sarna (== Rig, Yajur, and Saman). The fourth Veda, the Atharva, is not mentioned, but MA says its existence is implied when the histories (Itihasa) are called \"the fifth,\" i.e., of the works regarded as authoritative by the brah-inins. It is more likely, however, that the histories are called \"the fifth\" in connection with the four branches of study auxiliary to the Vedas that precede them in the description. The translation of technical terms here fol-lows MA, with the help of Monier-William's Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Oxford, 1899). On the marks of a Great Man, MA says that this was a science based on 12,000 works explaining the characteristics of gr~at men, s~ch. as Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, chief diSciples, great dISCIples, Wheel-turning Monarchs, etc. These works included 16,000 verses called liThe Buddha Mantra.\" 851 The thirty-two marks, enumerated in §9 below, are the subject of an entire sutta in the Dlgha Nikaya, DN 30, Lakkha1J.a Sutta. There each of the marks is explained as the kammk consequence of a particular virtue perfected by the Buddha during his earlier existences as a bodhisatta. 852 The seven treasures are discussed in MN 129.34-41. The acquisition of the wheel-treasure explains why he is called a \"Wheel-turning Monarch.\""},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"1294 The Majjhima Nikaya 853 MA: The world, enveloped in the darkness of the defile-ments, is covered by seven veils: lust, hate, delusion, COn-ceit, views, ignorance, and immoral conduct. Having removed these veils, the Buddha abides generating light all around. 854 MA explains that the Buddha worked this feat after first ascertaining that Uttara's teacher, Brahmayu, had the potential for achieving the fruit of non-returning, and that his attainment of this fruit depended upon the dispelling of Uttara's doubts. 855 The seven are the backs of the four limbs, the two shoul-ders, and the trunk. 856 RasaggasaggI. The LakkhaIJ-a Sutta expands (DN 30.2.7/ iii.l66): \"Whatever he touches with the tip of his tongue he tastes in his throat, and the taste is dispersed every-where.\" It is difficult, however, to understand either how this quality could be considered a physical characteristic or how it could be perceived by others. 857 This mark, the uIJ-hrsa, accounts for the protuberance com-monly seen on the top of the head of Buddha-images. 858 This is the standard reflection on the proper use of alms-food, as at MN 2.14. 859 The blessing (anumodana) is a short talk following the meal, instructing the donors in some aspect of the Dhamma and expressing the wish that their meritorious kamma.will brmg them abundant fruit. 860 MA: This is the intention: \"The excellent qualities I have not described are far more numerous than those I have described. The excellent qualities of Master Gotama are like the great earth and the great ocean; expounded in detail they are infinite and immeasurable, like space.\" 861 The Pali word for the tongue, jivha, is of the feminine gender. 862 What must be directly known (abhififieyya) are the Four Noble Truths, what must be developed (bhavetabba) is the Noble Eightfold Path, and what must be abandoned (pahiitabba) are the defilements headed by craving. Here the context requires that the word \"Buddha\" be under-stood in the specific sense of a Fully Enlightened One (sammasambuddha ). Notes to Suttas 91-93 1295 863 V~daga. This term and the following two -tevijja and sot-thzya -. seem to have represented ideal types among the brahmms; see too MN 39.24, 26, and 27. The sixth and seventh terms -kevalI and muni -were probably ideal types among the non-Vedic ascetic orders. By his reply, the. Buddha endows these terms with new meanings denved from his own spiritual system. 864 865 866 ~ere and in the reply the word \"Buddha\" may signify sImply one who is enlightened or awakened in a sense applicable to ~ny arah~nt, though Brahmayu', s response also suggests It may be mtended in the narrower sense of a Fully Enlightened One. MA offers an involved explanation of how the Buddha's reply answers all eight of Brahmayu's questions. As at MN 56.18. SUITA 92 867 The text of this sutta has not been included in the PTS ed. of the Majjhima Nikaya, as it is identical with the sutta of the same name in the Sutta Nipata, published in two dif-ferent versions by the PTS.

You have practised their mode of conduct. There-for~, you will not be defeated. Victory will be yours.\" ThIS statement is intended to show that brahmins are ~orn of women, just like other human beings, and there IS thus no substance to their claim that they are born of Brahma's mouth."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"1296 The Majjhima Nikaya 872 873 874 875 876 Yo~a is probably the Pali equivalent of ~o~a, t~e ~efe.r­ence being to the Bactrian Greeks.

MA identifies Devala the Dark, Asita Devala, with the Buddha in an earlier life. The Buddha undertakes this teaching to show: \"In the past, when you were of a supe-rior birth and I was of an inferior birth, you could not answer a question I asked you about an assertion con-cerning birth. So how can you do so now, when you are inferior and I have become a Buddha?\" As in MN 38.26. MA: P~a was the name of a servant of the seven seers; he would take a spoon, cook leaves, and serve them.

SUTIA 95 880 The opening passage of this sutta, down to §10, is virtually identical with the opening of the Scn;zadm:u!a Sutta (ON 4). 881 MA: It was called thus because offerings were made there to the gods. 882 Another wealthy brahmin who resided in UkkaH~a., a crown property given to him by King Pasenadl.

Of these five grounds for arriving at a conViction, the first two seem to be primarily emotive, the third to be a blind acceptance of tradition, and the last two primarily rational or cognitive. The \"two differ-885 886 887 888 ent ways\" each may tum out are true and false. It is not proper for him to come to this conclusion because he has not personally ascertained the truth of his conviction but only accepts it on a ground that is not capable of yielding certainty. Saccl1nurakkhana: or, the safeguarding of truth, the protec-tion of truth. Saccilnubodha: or, the awakening to truth. The procedure for the discovery of truth recommended in this sutta appears to be an elaboration of the approach described in MN 47. 889 Tu/eli. MA: He investigates things in terms of imperma-nence, and so forth. This stage thus seems to be that of insight contemplation. 890 891 892 893 Although applying the will (ussahati) appears similar to striving (padahati), the former may be understood as the exertion undertaken prior to insight contemplation, the latter as the exertion that brings insight up to the level of the supramundane path. MA: He realises Nibbana with the mental body (of the path of stream-entry), and having penetrated the defile-ments, he sees Nibbana with wisdom, making it clear and evident. While the discovery of truth in this context appears to signify the attainment of stream-entry, the final arrival at truth (sacciinuppatti) seems to mean the full attainment of arahantship.

Verses 27-54 here are identical with Dhp 396-423, except for an additional couplet in Dhp 423. 905 MA: By the present volitional action which accomplishes the work of farming, etc. 906 With this verse the word \"kamma\" undergoes a shift in meaning signalled by the term \"dependent origination.\" \"Kamma\" here no longer means simply present action determining one's social status, but action in the special sense of a force binding beings to the round of existence. This same line of thought becomes even clearer in the next verse. 907 This verse and the following one again refer to the ara-hant. Here, however, the contrast is not between the ara-hant as the one made holy by his actions and the born brahmin unworthy of his designation, but between the arahant as the one liberated from the bondage of action and result and all other beings who remain tied by their actions to the wheel of birth and death.

See MN 12.12. 915 MA explains limiting action (pamaIJakatam kammam) as kamma pertaining to the sense sphere (kiimilvacara). It is contrasted with a limitless or immeasurable action, namely, the jhanas pertaining to the fine-material sphere or the immaterial sphere. In this case the brahmavihilras developed to the jhanic level are intended. When a jhana pertaining to the fine-material sphere or the immaterial sphere is attained and mastered, a kamma pertaining to the sense sphere cannot overpower it and gain the oppor-tunity to yield its own result. Rather, the kamma pertain-ing to the fine-material sphere or the immaterial sphere overpowers the sense-sphere kammas and produces its results. Obstructing the result of the sense-sphere kam-mas, the brahmavihara that has been mastered leads to rebirth in the-company of Brahma. 916 As at MN 27.2 SurrA 100 917 DhanafijanI,was 'a stream-enterer.

Elsewhere faith and reasoning are con-trasted as two different grounds of conviction (MN 95.14), and \"mere faith\" seems more closely allied with reliance on oral tradition than with reasoning and investigation. Notes to Suttas 100 and 101 1301 920 Samam yeva dhammam abhififiaya. This phrase emphasises direct personal realisation as the foundation for promul-gating a holy life. 921 MA says that Sangarava had the idea that the Buddha spoke thus without actual knowledge, and he therefore accuses the Buddha of false speech. The sequence of ideas in this passage is difficult to follow and it is likely that the text is corrupt. SurrA 101 922 This doctrine, which is here ascribed to the Jains, is also taken up for criticism by the Buddha at SN 36:21/ iv.230-31 and AN 3:61/i.173-74. The Buddha's teaching recognises the existence of feeling that is not the result of past action but a concomitant of present action, and also admits feeling that is neither kammically active nor kam-mic result. 923 From here until §5, \"That being so ... ,\" also at MN 14.17-19. The statement of the Nigal)tha Nataputta, which at MN 14.17 introduces the Nigal)thas' position, here comes afterwards, at §lO, as the Nigal)thas' justifica-tion for their assertion. 924 As at MN 95.14. 925 It is not fitting for them to make that declaration because their \"intense exertion,\" i.e., their ascetic practice, is the cause for their painful feelings, as the Buddha states in §15. 926 This is a teclmical expression for an action that is to ripen in this present life. 927 MA:\" An action ( whose result] is to be experienced iI} a matured (personality]\" is a synonym for an action [whose result] is to be experienced here and now. \"An action [whose result] is to be experienced in an unma-tured personality\" is a synonym for action [whose result] is to be experienced in the next life. But a specifi-cation is made as follows: any action that yields its result in the same life is one to be experienced here and now, but only an action that produces its result within seven days is called one to be experienced in a matured personality."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"1302 The Majjhima Nikaya 928 This is an action that does not gain the opportunity to yield its result and thereby becomes defunct. 929 Issaranimmanahetu. This doctrine of the theists is criticised by the Buddha at AN 3:61/i.174. 930 Sangatibhiivahetu. This alludes to the doctrine of Makkhali Gosala, criticised at length at MN 60.21 and AN 3:61/ i.175. 931 Abhijiltihetu. This also refers to a tenet of Makkhali Gosala. 932 This is a formulation of the Buddha's Middle Way, which avoids the extreme of self-mortification without falling into the other extreme of infatuation with sensual pleasure. 933 MA explains the source of suffering to be craving, so called because it is the root of the suffering comprised in the five aggregates. The passage shows two alternative approaches toward overcoming craving - one employing energetic striving, the other detached equanimity. The \"fading away\" of the source is identified by MA with the supramundane path. The passage is said to illustrate the practice of one who progresses on a pleasant path with quick direct knowledge (sukhapatipada khippabhififia). 934 This passage is brought forth to show the Buddha's rea-son for permitting his monks to undertake the ascetic practices (dhutanga): the moderate use of austerities is conductive to overcoming the defilements. But they are not undertaken to wear away old kainma and to purify the soul, as the jains and other ascetic sects believed. MA says that this passage illustrates the practice of one who progresses on a difficult path with sluggish direct knowl-edge (dukkhapatipada dandhabhififia). SUTIA 102 935 This sutta is a \"middle length\" counterpart of the longer Brahmajala Sutta, included in the DIgha Nikaya and pub-lished in translation with its commentaries in Bodhi, Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views. Detailed explanations for almost all the views mentioned in this sutta will be found in the Introduction and Part Two of that work. 936 Aroga, \"healthy,\" explained by MA as meaning permanent. Notes to Sutta 102 1303 937 In the Brahmajala Sutta sixteen varieties of this view are mentioned, the eight given here and two other tetrads: the self as finite, infinite, both, and neither; and the self as experiencing exclusively pleasure, exclusively pain, a mixture of both, and neither. In the present sutta these two tetrads are incorporated under speculations about the past in § 14. 938 Evidently, in the above list the views of the self as imma-terial, percipient of unity, and percipient of the immea-surable are based on attainment of the base of infinite space. MT explains the consciousness-kasiJ:ta as the base of infinite consciousness, stating that these theorists declare that base to be the self. 939 The perception within the third immaterial meditation-the base of nothingness - is the subtlest and most refined of all mundane perceptions. Although there is still a kind of perception in the fourth immaterial attainment, it is so subtle that it is considered no longer appropriate to des-ignate it perception. 940 MA paraphrases thus: \"All those types of perceptions together with the views are conditioned, and because they are conditioned, they are gross. But there is Nibbana, called the cessation of formations, that is, of the conditioned. Having known 'There is this,' that there is Nibbana, seeing the escape from the conditioned, the Tathagata has gone beyond the conditioned.\" 941 The second tetrad of §3 is dropped here since the self is conceived as non-percipient. In the Brahmajala Sutta eight varieties of this view are mentioned, these four plus the finite-infinite tetrad. 942 MA points out that this statement is made with reference to those planes of existence where all five aggregates exist. In the immaterial planes consciousness occurs without the aggregate of material form, and in the non-percipient plane there is material form without con-sciousness. But consciousness never occurs without the three other mental aggregates. 943 The Brahmajala Sutta mentions eight varieties of this view, these four plus the finite-infinite tetrad. 944 Sammoha, here obviously having a different meaning"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"1304 The Majjhima Nikaya 945 946 947 948 949 than the usual \"confusion\" or \"delusion.\" MA explains the compound dit(hasutamutavififiatabba as meaning \"what is to be cognized as the seen, heard, and sensed\" and takes it to refer to sense-door cognitions. However, it can also comprise all grosser mind-door cog-nitions as well. To enter the fourth immaterial attain-ment, all the ordinary \"mental formations\" involved in other cognitive processes must be overcome, for their persistence is an obstacle to entering this attainment. Hence it is called \"not percipient\" (n'eva safiiil). Sasankharavasesasamapatti. Within the fourth immaterial attainment a residue of extremely subtle mental forma-tions remains. Hence it is called \"not non-percipient\" (nasafifiI) . The Brahmajala explains seven types of annihilationism, here all collected together as one. The \"fear and disgust with personality\" is an aspect of vibhavatal;lhii, the craving for non-existence. The annihila-tionist view to which it gives rise still involves an identifi-cation of personality with self - a self that is annihilated at death -and thus, despite his denial, it binds the theorist to the round of existence. So far only four of the original five classes of speculations about the future have been analysed, yet the Buddha speaks as if they were all explicated:MA tries to resolve the proble·J:h by explaining that assertions of \"Nibbana here and now\" were comprised by the terms \"percipient of unity\" and \"percipient of diversity\" in §3. This expla-nation, however, is not convincing. Nm, in Ms, had added the heading \"Nibbana Here and Now\" over §17, and §§17-21 do seem to correspond with the last four of the five doctrines of Nibbana here and now in the Brahmajala. However, this interpretation seems contra-dicted by §13 and by the phrase used in §17, §19 and §21, \"with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future,\" which would exclude the doctrines of Nibbana here and now. The problem seems insoluble, and raiseS the question whether a passage on Nibbana here and now was not lost in the course of the sutta's oral trans-mission. In the Brahmajala the five doctrines are the asser-950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 Notes to Sutta 102 1305 tion of sensual pleasures and the four jhanas to be the self's attainment of supreme Nibbana here and now. This view includes all four of the eternalists who specu-late about the past mentioned in the BrahmajiIla. Since this is a view referring to the past, it may be taken to imply that the self and the world arose spontaneously out of nothing at some point in the past. Thus it would comprise the two doctrines of fortuitous origination of the Brahmajllla, as MA maintains. This includes the four types of partial eternalism. This may include the four types of endless equivocation or \"eel-wriggling\" of the Brahmajiila. Views 5-8 correspond exactly to the four extensionists of the Brahmajala. The eight views (9-16) are, in the Brahmajala, included among the doctrines of percipient immortality comprised under speculations about the future. That is, they must accept their doctrine on some ground other than knowledge, one involving belief or reasoning. At MN 95.14, it is said that these five grounds of convic-tion yield conclusions that can turn out to be either true or false. MA: That is not really knowledge but wrong understand-ing; thus it is declared to be clinging to views. MA says that at this point aU sixty-two of the views set forth in the Brahmajala Sutta have been' incorporated, yet this sutta has an even wider range since it includes an exposition of personality view (most notably implied by §24). This ~ection title, ~d the following Roman numeral \"V\", were mserted by Nm on the supposition that this passage presents the doctrines of Nibbana here and now, men-tioned but not explicated earlier. However, as pointed out in n .949, while the text of this passage lends some support to that supposition, there are also cogent reasons against it. Unfortunately, Ms contains no note by Nm dealing with the problem of sequence in this sutta.

This refers to the first two jhanas, which include pILi. 962 MA explains that this is the grief caused by the loss of the jhana.

This is the pleasure of the third jhana. 964 The fourth jhana. 965 Santo'ham asmi, nibbuto'ham asmi, anupadano'ham asmi. In the Pali the expression aham asmi, \"I am,\" reveals that he is still involved with clinging, as the Buddha will point out. 966 MA takes this to be an allusion to personality view. Thus he is still clinging to a view. 967 MA states that elsewhere the expression \"liberation through not clinging\" (anupada vimokkha) signifies Nibbana, but here it means the attainment of the fruit of arahantship. 968 The Brahmajala Sutta too points to the understanding of the origination, etc., of the six bases of contact as the way to transcend all views. SUTIA 103 969 Bhavabhavahetu. MA: \"Do you think that he teaches the Dhamma as a means of gaining merit. so that he can expe-rience happine~s in this or that [higher] state of being?\" 970 Abhidhamma. MA says that this refers to the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment mentioned in the previous paragraph. See n.362. 971 Meaning (attha) and phrasing (byafljana) are the two aspects of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. The fol-lowing passage, §§5-8, should be compared with ON 29.18-21/iii.128-29, which also expresses a concern for the preservation of the correct meaning and phrasing of the Dhamma. 972 This statement is made because slight deviations from the correct phraSing are not necessarily an obstacle to a proper understanding of the meaning. But elsewhere (e.g., AN 2:20/i.59) the Buddha points out that the wrong expression of the letter and the wrong interpretation of Notes to Suttas 103 and 104 1307 the meaning are two factors responsible for the distortion and disappearance of the true Dhamma. 973 The general principle underlying §§10-14 is this: If the offending bhikkhu can be rehabilitated, then despite the hurt to him and the trouble to oneself, one should try to correct him. But if he is not susceptible to being rehabili-tated, one should just maintain one's own equanimity. 974 \"The Recluse\" (samm:za) is glossed by MA with satthil, the Teacher, referring to the Buddha. A similar use of the term is found at MN 105.18, 2l. 975 The \"thing\" (dhamma) intended, MA says, is quarrelling. SUTIA 104 976 The opening of this sutta is the same as that of ON 29, which is also concerned with preserving harmony in the Sangha after the Buddha's demise. 977 MA: The \"shrine\" and \"refuge\" are the NigaDtha Nataputta, who is now dead. 978 The novice Cunda was the younger brother of Yen. Sariputta. 979 Even while the Buddha was still alive such a dispute had already broken out among the bhikkhus at KosambI, referred to at MN 48.2. 980 This would be a dispute about the Noble Eightfold Path or the other requisites of enlightenment. 981 The first four pairs are included among the \" imperfec-tions that defile the mind\" at MN 7.3. 982 AdhikarmJa.

Homer translates \"verdict in the pres-ence 6f.\" At Yin iL93, this is explained as confrontation with (or presence of) the Sangha, the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the individuals who are parties to the dis-pute. This kind of settlement applies to all four kinds of litigation, with minor differences in formulation. 985 Dhammanetti samanumajjitabba. MA gives as an example of dhammanetti the ten courses of wholesome and unwholesome conduct, but says that here the Dhamma and Discipline themselves are meant. 986 Sativinaya. Horner renders \"verdict of innocence\". At Yin iL80, it is said that this is given when a bhikkhu is pure and without offences and he is reproached with an offence; he must ask the Sangha to give him such a ver-dict by appeal to his full and accurate recollection of his behaviour. 987 An offence involving defeat, a parajika offence, requires expulsion from the Sangha. An offence bordering on defeat is either a sanghiidisesa offence, which requires a formal meeting pf the Sangha and a period of temporary penalisation, or the preliminary steps leading to a parajika offence. 988 Amft/havinaya. A verdict of past insanjty is given when a bhikkhu commits offences during a period of madness. The criterion for determining insanity is that he must have no recollection of his behaviour during the period for which the verdict is requested. 989 The procedure described is the established method by which a bhikkhu obtains exoneration for his transgres-sion when he has fallen into any offence that can be cleared by confession. 990 Papiyyasiktt. Homer renders \"decision for specific depra,:,-ity.\" This verdict is pronounced against a bhikkhu who IS a maker of strife and quarrels in the Sangha, who is igno-Notes to Suttas 104 and 105 1309 rant and full of offences, or who lives in unbecoming association with householders. 991 TilJavattharaka. This means of settlement is resorted to when the Sangha has been involved in a dispute in the course of which the bhikkhus committed many minor offences. Since to pursue charges for these offences might prolong the conflict, the offences are cleared by the means described in the sutta. MA explains that this method is like throwing grass over excrement to remove the bad smell, hence the name \"covering over with grass.\" 992 Offences calling for serious censure are those of the parajika and sanghiidisesa classes. Those connected with the laity are cases where a bhikkhu reviles and dispar-ages householders. 993 As at MN 48.6. 994 At MN 21.21, this is said with reference to the simile of the saw. SurrA 105 995 See MN 12 and n.177. 996 Adhimanena.

SUTIA 106 1007 1008 1009 1010 See n.1000. Here, too, the term \"imperturbable\" seems to cover only the fourth jhana and the two lower immaterial attainments. MA says both objective sensual pleasures and sensual defilements are intended.

The \"consciousness leading [to rebirth]\" (sari'lVattanikarfl vinna1Jarfl) is the resultant con-sciousness by which this person is reborn, and this has the same imperturbable nature as the kammically forma-tive consciousness that attained to the fourth jhana. Since it is the fourth-jhana consciousness that determines rebirth, this person will be reborn in one of the celestial realms corresponding to the fourth jhana. 1012 MA says that this is the reflection of one who has attained the fourth jhana. Since he includes material form among the things to be transcended, if he attains to the imperturbable he reaches the base of infinite space, and if he does not attain arahantship he is reborn in the plane of infinite space. 1013 MA says that this is the reflection of one who has attained the base of infinite space. If he attains to the imper-turbable, he reaches the base of infinite consciousness and is reborn in that plane if he does not reach arahantship. 1014 This is the reflection of one who has attained the base of infinite consciousness and aims at attaining the base of nothingness. 1015 MA calls this two-pointed voidness - the absence of \"I\" and \"mine\" -and says that this teaching of the base of nothingness is expounded by way of insight rather than concentration, the approach taken in the previous sec-tion. At MN 43.33, this contemplation is said to lead to the deliverance of mind through voidness. 1016 MA calls this four-pointed voidness and explains thus: (i) he does not see his self anywhere; (ii) he does not see a self of his own that can be treated as something belong-ing to another, e.g., as a brother, friend, assistant, etc.; (iii) he does not see the self of another; (iv) he does not see the self of another that can be treated as something belonging to him.

The first part of the formula again seems to be a condensed formulation of a view held by non-Buddhists. Several suttas identify it as an expression for the annihilationist view, adapted by the Buddha with new meanings assigned to it. For other occurrences of this formula, see SN iii.55-56, 99,183,206; AN iv.69-72, v.63. 1018 MA says that he obtains the equanimity of insight, but from §11 it seems that the equanimity of the base of nei-ther-perception-nor-non-perception is also intended. 1019 MA: This is said with reference to the rebirth of one who attains the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. The meaning is that he takes rebirth in the best, the high-est, plane of existence. 1020 Nissaya nissiiya oghassa nittharat;tii.

MA: This is the personality in its entirety -the round of the three realms of existence; there is no personality outside of this. 1023 MA says that the arahantship of the dry-insight medita-tor is intended. MT adds that arahantship is called \"the Deathless\" because it has the flavour of the Deathless, being attained on the basis of Nibbana the Deathless.

MA glosses chanda by tm:zhll, craving, which is the origin of the suffering comprised by the five aggregates. 1039 As at MN 44.6. 1040 In the material form aggregate each of the four great ele-ments is a condition for the other three and for derived material form. Contact is a condition for each of the three middle aggregates, as it is said: \"Contacted one feels, bhikkhus; contacted one perceives; contacted one wills\" (SN 35:93/iv.68). MA explains that at the moment of con-ception, the ma'terial phenomena and the three mental aggregates that arise are the mentality-materiality that is a condition for the rebirth consciousness. During the course of life the physical sense faculties and the sense objects together with the three mental aggregates are the mentali-ty-materiality that is a condition for sense consciousness. 1041 As at MN 44.7-8. 1042 It seems that this bhikkhu had difficulty in understand-ing how kamma can produce results without a self to receive them. 1043 The readings of this sentence are highly divergent in dif-ferent editions. The same sutta appears at .SN 22:82/ iii.104, and the reading there (patipucchii vinTtii) seems preferable to the reading here (in the PTS ed., paticca vinftll; in the BBS ed., pativinltii). The translation here fol-Notes to Suttas 109-111 1315 lows the Samyutta text. Nm's translation, based on the PTS Majjhima text, reads: \"Now, bhikkhus, you have been trained by me in dependent [conditionality} in vari-ous instances.\" Neither version is idiomatic Pali, and the commentaries to both Nikayas are silent. 1044 MA: The sixty bhikkhus discarded their original medita-tion subjects and investigated a new subject (based on the Buddha's discourse, MT). Without breaking their posture, right in their seats they attained arahantship. SurrA 110 1045 Asappurisa. MA glosses by piipapurisa, an evil man. SUITA 111 1046 1047 1048 1049 1050 Anupadadhammavipassanll. MA explains that he devel-oped insight into states in successive order by way of the meditative attainments and the jhana factors, as will be described. The two-week period referred to fell from the time of Yen. Sariputta's ordination under the Buddha to his attainment of arahantship while listening to the Buddha explain the comprehension of feeling to Dlghanakha (see MN 74.14). The first five states in the list are the jhana factors proper of the first jhana; the follOWing states are additional com-ponents each performing their individual functions with-in the jhana. This minute analysis of mental states into their components anticipates the methodology of the Abhidhamma, and it is thus no coincidence that the name of Sariputta is so closely linked with the emergenre of the Abhidhamma literature. All these terms signify the temporary suppression of the defilements by the power of the jhana, not the full libera-tion from defilements through their eradication by the highest path, which Yen. Sariputta had yet to attain. The \"escape beyond\" (uttarim nissarm:zam) here is the next higher attainment, the second jhana. Reading with the BBS ed. passaddhattll cetaso anllbhogo. MA explains that the mental concern with pleasure,"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"1316 The Majjhima Nikaya which persists in the third jhana; is now considered to be gross, and when it subsides there is \"mental unconcern due to tranquillity.\" The PTS ed. reading, passi vedana, is tmintelligible and clearly an error. 1051 This indirect introspective method must be used to con-template the fourth immaterial attainment because this attainment, being extremely subtle, does not enter into the direct range of investigation for disciples. Only fully enlightened Buddhas are able to contemplate it directly. 1052 MA offers this explanation of the passage, transmitted by \"the elders of India\": \"The Elder Sariputta cultivated serenity and insight in paired conjunction and realised the fruit of non-returning. Then he entered the attain-ment of cessation, and after emerging from it he attained arahantship.\" 1053 Since there are no mental factors in the attainment of ces-sation, MA says that \"these states\" here must refer either to the states of material form that were occurring while he attained cessation, or to the mental factors of the pre-ceding fourth immaterial attainment. 1054 Note the realisation that there is \"no escape beyond\" the attainment of arahantship. 1055 Vasippatto paramipatto. See n.763. SUITA 112 1056 See n.17. 1057 As at MN 111.4, but here these terms are intended to express the complete eradication of defilements by the path of arahantship. 1058 MA: All these terms signify craving and views. 1059 MA: The first phrase negates the consideration of the earth element as self, the second negates the considera-tion of the material and mental factors other than the earth element as self. The same method applies to the other elements. 1060 The text appears redundant in mentioning both forms (rupa) and things cognizable (by the mind) through eye-consciousness (cakkhuvififiliIJa-vififilitabbli dhammli). MA mentions two opinions proposed to resolve this problem. Notes to Suttas 112 and 113 1317 One holds that \"forms\" refers to visible things that actu-ally enter into cognition, \"things cognizable ... \" to visible things that cease without being cognized. The second holds that the former term signifies all form without dis-tinction, the latter term the three mental aggregates that function in association with eye-consciousness. 1061 MA explains \"I-making\" (ahankara) as conceit and \"mine-making\" (mamanklira) as craving. \"All external signs\" (nimitta) are external objects. 1062 MA: The recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (usually included in this type of exposition) are here omitted because the original question at §11 concerned the attain-ment of arahantship, not mundane attainments. 1063 MA says that this sutta is also called the Ekavissajjita Sutta (The Single Answer Discourse). MA finds it diffi-cult to account for the \"sixfold\" mentioned in the original title, since only five questions and answers have come down in the discourse. It suggests dividing the last item into two -one's own body with its consciousness and the conscious bodies of others -and also mentions another opinion that the four nutriments should be brought in as the sixth. Neither of these suggestions, however, appears cogent, and it seems likely that a section has been lost. SUITA 113 1064 Sappurisadhamma; asappurisadhamma. 1065 These are nine of the thirteen ascetic practices discussed in Vsm II. 1066 MA explains \"non-identification\" (atammayatli, lit. \"not consisting of that\") as the absence of craving. However, the context suggests that the absence of conceit may be the meaning. The statement \"for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that\" (yena yena hi mafzfitinti tato tam hoti afifzatha) is a philosophical riddle appearing also at Sn 588, Sn 757, and Ud 3:10.

Unlike the jhanas and immaterial attainments, which can be attained by worldlings, cessation is the domain exclu-sively of non-returners and arahants. 1068 Na kifici mafifiati, na kuhifici mafifiati, na kenaci mafifiati. This is a brief statement of the same situation described in full at MN 1.51-146. On \"conceiving\" see n.6 SUTIA 114 1069 This first paragraph offers merely a \"table of contents,\" to be elaborated in the body of the sutta. 1070 Afifiamafifiam. MA: The two are mutually exclusive, and there is no way by which the one can be regarded as the other. 1071 Although wrong view and right view are usually includ-ed under mental conduct, in this sutta they are shown separately in §10 as \"the acquisition of view.\" 1072 Whereas the covetousness and ill will described in §7 possess the strength of a full course of action (kamma-patha), in this section on inclination of mind (cittuppiida) they are shown in their nascent stage as mere disposi-tions that have npt yet erupted into obsessive volitions. 1073 \"Acquisition of individuality\" (attabhllvapatilllbha) here refers to mode of rebirth. 1074 Aparinitthitabhava. The translation of this unusual expres-sion follows the gloss by MA. 1075 MA points out that the clause \"Forms are either the one or the other\" is not used here because the distinction does not lie in the object but in the approach to it. For one person lust and other defilements arise towards a partic-ular form, but another person develops dispassion and detachment in regard to the same form. 1076 MA says that those who study the text and commentary to this sutta without practising in accordance with it can-not be said to \"understand the detailed meaning.\" Only those who practise accordingly can be so described. Notes to Sutta 115 1319 SUTIA 115 1077 The eighteen elements are defined at Vbh §§183-84/ 87-90 and are explained in detail at Vsm XV, 17-43. Briefly, the mind element (manodhatu), according to the Abhidhamma, includes the consciousness that adverts to the five sense objects impinging on the five sense facul-ties (paficadvllrllvajjana-citta) and the consciousness that receives the object after it has been cognized through the senses (sampaticchana-citta). The mind-consciousness ele-ment (manovififilllJadhatu) includes all types of conscious-ness except the five sense consciousnesses and the mind-element. The mind-object element (dhammadhlltu) includes the types of subtle material phenomena not involved in sense cognition, the three mental aggregates of feeling, perception, and formations, and Nibbana. It does not include concepts, abstract ideas, judgements, etc. Though these latter are included in the notion of mind-object (dhammllrammaIJa), the mind-object element includes only things that exist by their own nature, not things constructed by the mind. 1078 These are defined at Vbh §180/85-86. The pleasure and pain elements are bodily pleasant and painful feeling; the joy and grief elements are mental pleasant and painful feel-ing; the equanimity element is neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. MA says that ignorance is brought in because of its apparent similarity to the equanimity element. 1079 Vbh §183/86-87 defines these as the six corresponding types of applied thought (vitakka); see MN 19.2. 1080 MA explains the sense-sphere element as the five aggre-gates pertaining to the sense-sphere (kllmttvacara), the fine-material element as the five aggregates pertaining to the fine-material sphere (rupllvacara), and the immaterial element as the four aggregates pertaining to the immater-ial sphere (arnpllvacara). 1081 MA: the conditioned element includes everything pro-duced by conditions and is a designation for the five aggregates. The unconditioned element is Nibbana. 1082 The twelve bases are defined at Vbh §§155-167/70-73 and explained at Vsm XV, 1-16. The mind base includes"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"1320 The Majjhima Nikaya 1083 1084 1085 1086 1087 1088 1089 all types of consciousness, and thus comprises all seven elements that exercise the function of consciousness. The mind-object base is identical with the mind-object element. On the terms in the formula of dependent origination, see Introduction, pp. 30-31. MA: A person possessing right view (ditthisampanno) is one possessing the view of the path, a noble disciple at the minimal level of a stream-enterer. \"Formation\" here is to be understood as a conditioned formation (sankhata-sankhiira), i.e., anything conditioned. MA points out that a noble disciple below the level of arahantship can still apprehend formations as pleasur-able with a mind dissociated from wrong view, but he cannot adopt the view that any formation is pleasurable. Although perceptions and thoughts of formations as pleasurable arise in him, he knows reflectively that such notions are mistaken. In the passage on self, sankhl1ra, \"formation,\" is replaced by dhamma, \"thing.\" MA explains that this substitution is made to include concepts, such as a kasiJ.:ta sign, etc., which the ordinary person is also prone to identify as self. However, in view of the fact that Nibbana is described as imperishable (accuta) and as bliss (sukha), and is also liable to be misconceived as self (see MN 1.26), the word sankhtira may be taken to include only the conditioned, while dhamma includes both .the conditioned and the unconditioned. This interpretatlOn, however, is not endorsed by the commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa. This section distinguishes the ordinary person and noble disciple in terms of the five heinous crimes. MA points out that a noble disciple is in fact incapable of intentio~­ally depriving any living being of life, but the contrast 15 made here by way of matricide and patricide to stress the dangerous side of the ordinary person's condition and the strength of the noble disciple. That is, could acknowledge anyone other than the Buddha as the supreme spiritual teacher. MA: The arising of another Buddha is impossible fro~ the time a bodhisatta takes his final conception in hIS Notes to Suttas 115 and 116 1321 mother's womb until his Dispensation has completely disappeared. The problem is discussed at Miln 236-39. 1090 This statement asserts only that a Fully Enlightened Buddha always has the male sex, but does not deny that a person who is now a woman may become a Fully Enlightened Buddha in the future. To do so, however, at an earlier point she will have had to be reborn as a man. 1091 In this passage the phrase \"on that account, for that rea-son\" (tannidilna tappaccaya)is of prime importance. As the Buddha will show in MN 136, a person who engages in evil conduct may be reborn in a heavenly world and a person who engages in good conduct may be reborn in a lower world. But in those cases the rebirth will be caused by some kamma different from the kamma in which the person habitually engages. Strict lawfulness applies only to the relation between kamma and its result. 1092 The \"four cycles\" are the elements, the bases, dependent origination, and the possible and the impossible. SurrA 116 1093 In Sri Lanka this sutta is regularly recited as a protective discourse and is included in the medieval compilation, Maha Pirit Pota, \"The Great Book of Protection.\" 1094 This and the following are mountains surrounding Rajagaha. 1095 A paccekabuddha is one who attains enlightenment and liberation on his own, without relying on the Dhamma taught by the Buddha, but is not capable of teaching the Dhamma to others and establishing the Dispensation. Paccekabuddhas arise only at a time when no Dispen-sation of a Buddha exists in the world. For a fuller study of the subject see Ria Kloppenborg, The Paccekabuddha: A Buddhist Ascetic. 1096 Ayam pabbato ime iSl gilati: a word play is involved here. 1097 Tagarasikhin is referred to at Ud 5:4/50 and SN 3:20/i.92. 1098 Nm remarks in Ms that without the aid of the commen-tary it is extremely difficult to distinguish the proper names of the paccekabuddhas from their descriptive epithets."},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"1322 The Majjhima Niktlya SUTTA 117 1099 Ariyam samma samadhim sa-upanisam saparikkharam. MA explains \"noble\" here as . supramundane, and says that this is the concentration pertaining to the supramundane path. Its \"supports and requisites,\" as will be shown, are the other seven path factors. 1100 Pubbangama, lit. \"the forerunner.\" MA says that two kinds of right view are forerunners: the right view of insight, which investigates formations as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; and the right view of the path, which arises as a consequence of insight and effects the radical destruction of defilements. The right view of insight as the forerunner seems to be shown in §§4, 10, 16,22 and 28; the right view of the path as forerunner in §§34and 35. 1101 This statement suggests that in order to acquire right view about the nature of reality, one must first be able to distinguish between wrong and right teachings on the nature of reality. MA says that this is the right view of insight which understands wrong view as an object by penetrating its characteristics of impermanence, etc., and which understands right view by exercising the function of comprehension and by clearing away confusion. 1102 This is mundane right view, a mer.itorious factor that conduces to a.favourable rebirth but cannot by itself issue in a transcendence of conditioned existence. 1103 This definition defines supramundane right view as the wisdom (panna) found among the requisites of enlighten-ment as a faculty, power, enlightenment factor, and path factor. The definition is formulated by way of the cogni-tive function rather than the objective content of the view. Elsewhere (MN 141.24) the right view of the path is defined as knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. We may understand that the conceptual comprehension of the four truths falls under mundane right view, while the direct penetration of the truths by realising Nibbana with the path constitutes supramundane right view. 1104 MA: They accompany right view as its co-existents and precursors. Right effort and right mindfulness are Notes to Sutta 117 1323 1105 co-existent with supramundane right view; the right view of insight is the precursor of supramundane right view. MA explains this as the right view of insight which understands right intention by way of its function and by 1106 1107 1108 1109 1110 1111 clearing away confusion. It seems, though, that a more elementary discrimination of the two kinds of intention is the issue. This is the standard definition of right intention as a fac-tor of the Noble Eightfold Path; see MN 141.25. In this definition, the factor of intention (sankappa) is identified with applied thought (vitakka), which is further speci~ied as the factor responsible for absorption by fix-ing and directing the mind upon its object. For applied thought as \"verbal formation,\" see MN 44.15. MA: This statement refers exclUSively to the co-existent factors accompanying supramundane right intention. In the preliminary phase of the practice, the three mundane right intentions arise separately, but at the moment of the supramundane path, a single right intention arises cut-ting off the threefold wrong intention. Thus the supra-mundane right intention may also be described as the intention of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-cruelty. The same method applies to right speech, etc. Whereas mundane right speech is exercised in four dif-ferent modes according to the type of wrong speech from which there is abstinence, on the occasion of the supra-mundane path, the single factor of right speech exercises the fourfold function of cutting off the tendencies towards the four kinds of wrong speech. The same prin-ciple applies to right action. These are wrong means for bhikkhus to acqUire their requisites; they are explained at Vsm I, 61-65. MA says that those mentioned in the sutta are not the only kinds of wrong livelihood, which include any mode of earning one's living that involves transgression of the precepts. At AN 5:177/iii.20B, the Buddha mentions five kinds of wrong livelihood for lay people: dealing in arms, beings, meat, intoxicants, and poisons. MA explains that for one having the right view of the path, the right intention of the path comes into being;"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"1324 The Majjhima Nikaya similarly, for one having the right view of the fruit, the right intention of the fruit comes into being. Similarly, the following factors except the last two also refer to the supramundane path. 1112 The additional two factors possessed by the arahant are right knowledge, which can be identified with his reviewing knowledge that he has destroyed all the defile-ments, and right deliverance, which can be identified with his experience of liberation from all defilements. 1113 The twenty factors on the wholesome side are the ten right factors and the wholesome states that originate from each; the twenty factors on the unwholesome side are the ten wrong factors and the unwholesome states that origi-nate from each. Hence the name \"The Great Forty.\" 1114 MA says only that these two were individuals who lived in the country of Okkala. Otherwise their identity is unknown. SUTIA 118 1115 The PavaraI).a is the ceremony that concludes the rains residence, at which the bhikkhus invite each other to admonish them for their transgressions. 1116 Komudl is the full-moon day of the month of Kattika, the fourth month of the rainy season; it is -called by this name because the white water-lily (kumuda) is said to bloom at that time. 1117 Explanatory notes for the first tetrad will be found at nn.140-142. MN 10.4 differs from this passage only by the addition of the simile. Since Acariya Buddhaghosa has commented on the four tetrads on mindfulness of breathing in the Visuddhimagga, in MA he merely refers the reader to the latter work for explanation. Notes 1118-21 are drawn from Vsm VIII, 226-37, also included by Nm in his Mindfulness of Breathing. 1118 One experiences rapture in two ways: by attaining one of the lower two jhanas in which rapture is present, on~ expe-riences rapture in the mode of serenity; by emerging from that jhana and contemplating that rapture as subject to destruction, one experiences rapture in the mode of insight. Notes to Sutta 118 1325 1119 The same method of explanation as in n.1118 applies to the second and third clauses, except that the second com-prises the three lower jhanas and the third all four jhanas. The mental formation is perception and feeling (see MN 44.14), which is tranquillised by the development of 1120 successively higher levels of serenity and insight. \"Experiencing the mind\" is to be understood by way of the four jhanas. \"Gladdening the mind\" is explained 1121 1122 1123 1124 either as the attainment of the two jhanas containing rap-ture or as the penetration of those jhanas with insight as subject to destruction, etc. \"Concentrating the mind\" refers either to the concentration pertaining to the jhana or to the momentary concentration that arises along with insight. \"Liberating the mind\" means liberating it from h~ndrances and grosser jhanic factors by successively higher levels of concentration, and from the cognitive distortions by way of insight knowledge. This tetrad deals entirely with insight, unlike the previ-ous three, which deal with both serenity and insight. \"Contemplating fading away\" and \"contemplating cessa-tion\" can be understood both as the insight into the impermanence of formations and as the supramundane path rea~ising Nibbana, called the fading away of lust (Le., dispassion, viraga) and the cessation of suffering. \"Contemplating relinquishment\" is the giving up of defilements through insight and the entering into Nibbana by attainment of the path. MA: In-and-out breathing is to be counted as the air ele-ment among the four elements making up the body. It should also be ~cluded in the base of tangibles among bodily phenomena (since the object of attention is the touCh sensation of the breath entering and leaving the nostrils). MA explains that close attention (sadhuka manasiktira) is not itself actually feeling, but is spoken of as such only figuratively. In the second tetrad the actual feeling is the pleasure mentioned in the second clause and also the feeling comprised by the expression \"mental formation\" in the third and fourth clauses. MA: Although the meditating bhikkhu takes as his object the sign of in-and-out breathing, he is said to be"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"1326 The Majjhima Nikaya \"contemplating mind as mina\" because he maintains his mind on the object by arousing mindfulness and full awareness, two factors of mind. 1125 MA: Covetousness and grief signify the first two hin-drances, sensual desire and ill will, and thus represent the contemplation of mind-objects, which begins with the five hindrances. The bhikkhu sees the abandoning of the hindrances effected by the contemplations of imperma-nence, fading away, cessation, and relinquishment, and thus comes to look upon the object with equanimity. 1126 MA says that the above passage shows the enlighten-ment factors existing together in each mind-moment in the practice of insight meditation. 1127 See n.4B. 1128 MA: The mindfulness that comprehends breathing is mundane; the mundane mindfulness of breathing perfects the mundane foundations of mindfulness; the mundane foundations of mindfulness perfect the supramundane enlightenment factors; and the supramundane enlighten-ment factors perfect (or fulfil) true knowledge and deliver-ance, i.e., the fruit and Nibbana. SurrA 119 1129 §§4-17 of this sutta is identical with MN 10.4-30, except that here the refrain on insight has been replaced by the refrain that begins\" As he abides thus diligent.\" This change indicates a shift in emphasis from insight in MN 10 to concentration in the present sutta. This shift reappears in the passage on the jhanas at §§18-21 and the passage on the direct knowledges at §§37-41, both of which distinguish this sutta from MN 10. 1130 The similes for the jhanas are also found at MN 39.15-18 and MN 77.25-28. 1131 Vijjabhligiyli dhammli.

Notes to Sutta 120 1327 SurrA 120 1132 1133 1134 1135 1136 Although I have attempted to render sankhtlrli consistent-ly throughout as \"formations,\" here it seemed that the content required a different rendering to bring the intend-ed meaning to light. Nm had used \"determinations,\" his own consistent choice for sankhlirtl. MA initially explains sankhlirupapatti as meaning either reappearance (Le., rebirth) of mere formations, not of a being or person, or reappearance of the aggregates in a new existence through a meritorious kamma-formation. However, in subse-quent passages, MA glosses sankhlirli with patthanli, a word unambiguously meaning aspiration. MA: \"The way\" is the five qualities beginning with faith, together with the aspiration. One who has either the fi~e qualities without the aspiration, or the aspiration WIthout the qualities, does not have a fixed destination. The destination can only be fixed when both factors are present. MA explains that there are five kinds of pervasion: perva-sion of mind, i.e., knowing the thoughts of the beings throughout a thousand worlds; pervasion of the kasina i.e., extending the kasiDa image to a thousand worlds; pervasion of the divine eye, i.e., seeing a thousand worlds with the divine eye; pervasion of light, which is the same as the previous pervasion; and pervasion of body, i.e., extending one's bodily aura to a thousand worlds. See n.426. MA: The five qualities mentioned are sufficient for rebirth into ~he sense-sphere realm, but for the higher modes of rebIrth and the destruction of the taints, more-is required. Basing oneself on the five qualities, if one attains the jhanas, one is reborn in the Brahma-world· if one attains the immaterial attainments, one is reborn'in the immaterial world; if one develops insight and attains the fruit of non-returning, one is reborn in the Pure Ab~des; and if one reaches the path of arahantship, one attams the destruction of the taints."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"1328 The Majjhima Nikaya 1137 1138 1139 1140 1141 1142 1143 1144 SUfifiatavihara. The discourse will gradually make it clear that this refers to the fruition attainment of void-ness (sufifiataphala-samapatti), the fruition attainment of arahantship that is entered by focusing upon the void aspect of Nibbana. See n.458. MA: He attends to the perception of forest dependent on the single forest itself, thinking: \"This is a forest, this is a tree, this is a mountain, this a grove.\" MA and MT explain the sense of this passage thus: The disturbance of defilements - attraction and repulsion _ that arise through perception of people are not present here. But there is still the disturbance caused by the occurrence of gross states due to lack of the necessary tranquillity. MA: He abandons the perception of forest and attends to the perception of earth because one cannot achieve any distinction in meditation through the perception of for-est, neither access concentration nor full absorption. But earth can be used as the preliminary object for kasiJ:ta, on the basis of which one produces jhana, develops insight, and attains arahantship. Having used the perception of earth to attain the four jhanas, he extends the earth-kasiDa and then removes the kasiDa sign to attain the base of infinite space. See VsmX, 6-'7. Animitta cetosamadhi. MA: This is the concentration of the mind in insight; it is called \"signless\" because it is devoid of the signs of permanence, etc. . See MN 52.4. MA calls this \"counter-insight\" (pativipas-sana), i.e., the application of the principles of insight to the act of consciousness that exercises the function of insight. On the basis of this he attains arahantship. Here the words \"supreme and unsurpassed\" (paramanut-tara) have been added. MA says that this is the arahant's fruition attainment of voidness.

MA: This was a dwelling built in Nigrodha's Park by Kalakhemaka the Sakyan. Beds, chairs, mattresses, and mats were prepared, and they were so close together that the dwelling looked like the residence of a society of bhikkhus. MA explains that this was merely a rhetorical question, since the Buddhas can know by direct knowledge what-ever they wish to know. The Buddha asked this with the thought in mind: \"As soon as these bhikkhus form into a society and delight in society, they will act in improper ways. I shall expound the Great Practice of Voidness which will be like a training rule [prohibiting delight in society].\" MA: Ven. Ananda intended to say: \"These bhikkhus are living this way not just because they delight in being busy, but on account of making robes.\" See MN 66.20 and n.678. The former is deliverance through the jhanas and the immaterial attainments, the latter deliverance through the supramundane paths and fruits. See also MN 29.6 andn.348. MA: The Buddha begins the present passage in order to ward off the criticism that while he enjoins his disciples to live in solitude, he himself is often surrounded by a large retinue. \"Voidness\" here is the fruition attainment of voidness; see n.1137. MA explains voidness internally as that connected wjth one's own five aggregates, voidness externally as that con-nected with the aggregates of others. The voidness spoken of here thus must be the temporary deliverance of mind reached through the insight contemplation of non-self, as explained at MN 43.33. When the insight into non-self is brought to the level of the path, it issues in the fruition experiencing Nibbana by way of its aspect of voidness.

If, after emerging from the basic jhana, his mind does not enter into voidness through insight contempla-tion on his own aggregates or those of others, and he also cannot attain the imperturbable immaterial attainment, he should return to the same basic jhana that he origin-ally developed and attend to it again and again. 1155 According to MA, up to this point the Buddha has shown the training for the attainment of the first two paths, those of stream-entry and once-returning. He now speaks the present passage (§§14-15) to point out the insight needed to attain the path of non-returning, which culminates in the abandoning of sensual desire. 1156 This passage (§§16-17) points out the insight needed to attain the path of arahantship, which culminates in the abandoning of the conceit\"l am.\" 1157 Acariyupaddava, antevasupaddava, brahmacariyupaddava. Upaddava may also be rendered as disaster, calamity. MA explains that the Buddha speaks the present passage to show the danger in solitude when one does not fulfil the proper purpose of solitary living. The \"teacher\" is a teacher outside the Buddha's Dispensation. 1158 MA: The going forth into homelessness outside the Dispensation brings small gain, so one who falls away from that falls away only from mundane attainment; he meets with no great suffering, as one who falls from the back of a donk~y merely becomes covered with dust. But the going forth in the Buddha's Dispensation brings great gain -the paths, fruits, and Nibbana. Thus one who falls away from this meets great suffering, like one who falls from the back of an elephant. 1159 The contrast in this simile is between the way the potter treats the raw damp clay and the way he treats the baked pots produced from the clay. MA paraphrases: \"After advising once I shall not be silent; I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly admonishing you. Just as the pot-ter tests the baked pots, puts aside those that are cracked, split, or faulty, and keeps only those that pass the test, so I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly testing you. Those among you who are sound, having reached the Notes to Suttas 122 and 123 1331 paths and fruits, will stand the test.\" MA adds that the mundane virtuous qualities are also intended as a crite-rion of soundness. SurrA 123 1160 This ability is exemplified by DN 14, which provides detailed information about the six Buddhas preceding Gotama. 1161 This refers to the Bodhisatta's rebirth in the Tusita heav-en, which followed his preceding human existence as Vessantara and preceded his birth in the human world as Siddhattha Gotama. 1162 MA: Between every three world systems there is an inter-space measuring 8,000 yojanas; it is like the space between three cartwheels or almsbowls touching one another. The beings who live there have taken rebirth there because of committing some heavy, terrible offence against their parents or righteous recluses and brahmins, or because of some habitual evil deed like killing animals, etc. 1163 MA: The four deities were the Four Great Kings (the pre-siding deities of the heaven of the Four Great Kings). 1164 MA: This happened, not through a defect in the birth, but through the expiration of her lifespan; for the place (in the womb) occupied by the Bodhisatta, like the inner chamber of a cetiya, is not to be used by others. 1165 MA explains each aspect of this event as a foretoken of the Buddha's later attainments. Thus, his standing with his feet (pada) firmly on the ground was a foretoken of his attaining the four bases for spiritual power (iddhipada); his facing the north, of his going above and beyond the multitude; his seven steps, of his acquiring the seven enlightenment factors; the white parasol, of his acquiring the parasol of deliverance; his surveying the quarters, of his acquiring the unobstructed knowledge of omni-science; his uttering the words of the Leader of the Herd, of his setting in motion the irreversible Wheel of the Dhamma; his statement \"This is my last birth,\" of his passing away into the Nibbana element with no residue remaining (of the faclors of existence)."},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"1332 The Majjhima Nikiiya 1166 This statement seems to betl'\\e Buddha's way of calling attention to the quality he regarded as the true wonder and marvel. SUTTA 124 1167 According to MA, Yen. Bakkula became a monk in his eightieth year, which would make him 160 at the time this sutta takes place. He was declared by the Buddha to be the foremost disciple with respect to good health. 1168 MA says that the passages here enclosed in brackets were added by the elders who compiled the Dhamma. 1169 This passage and those to follow show Yen. Bakkula as an observer of the ascetic practices. The kathina time is the period following the three-month rains residence when bhikkhus make new robes from the cloth they have received. 1170 MA says that after he went forth, he was an ordinary man for seven days, but on the eighth day he attained arahantship together with the analytical know ledges (patisambhida). 1171 MA: Yen. Bakkula himself did not give the ordination (which would have been a violation of his mode of prac-tice) but arranged for other bhikkhus to give it. 1172 MA: Yen. Bakkula had considered that all his life he had never made himself a burden to the other bhikkhus, and he did notwant his body to be a burden after his death. Thus he entered into meditation on the heat element arid attained final Nibbana by causing his entire body to be consumed by the blaze. Only the relics remained. 1173 MA says that this sutta was recited at the second compi-lation of the Dhamma, held about a hundred years after the Buddha's passing away. SUTTA 125 1174 MA identifies Prince Jayasena as a son of King Bimbisara. 1175 The simile as at MN 90.1l. 1176 Note that here the four foundations of mindfulness are eX-pounded in the place usually reserved for the four jhanas. Notes to Suttas 125-127 1333 1177 Since the exposition begins here directly with the sec-ond jhana, this suggests that the earlier passage on the development of the foundations of mindfulness must have implicitly covered the first jhana. SUTTA 126 1178 MA says that Yen. Bhumija was the uncle of Prince Jayasena. 1179 Asam karitva: if one makes a wish, if one raises a hope or expectation. The recluses and brahmins who held this view must have been the sceptics or the annihilationists. SUTTA 127 1180 Appama1Jii cetovimutti, mahaggata cetovimutti.

Sin<.:e the formula for each brahmavihara includes the word \"exalted,\" Paf\\.ca-kanga was apparently misled into supposing that the two deliverances were the same in meaning. 1181 MA: He covers an area the size of one tree root with his kasil).a sign, and he abides resolved upon that kasil).a sign, pervading it with the exalted jhana. The same method of explanation applies to the following cases. 1182 MA: This teaching is undertaken to show the kinds of rebirth that result from the attainment of the exalted deliverance. 1183 MA explains that there are no separate realms of gods called those of \"Defiled Radiance\" and those of \"Pure Radiance.\" Both are subdivisions within the two realms -the gods of Limited Radiance and the gods of Immeasur-able Radiance. Rebirth among the gods of Limited Radiance is determined by the attainment of the (second) jhana with a limited kasil).a sign, rebirth among the gods of Im-measurable Radiance by the attainment of the same jhana with an extended kasil).a sign. Rebirth with defiled radiance is for those who have not mastered the jhana and purified it of obstructive states; rebirth with pure radiance is for those who have acquired this mastery and purification."},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"1334 The Majjhima Nikaya 1184 A pun is involved here. In Pali the verb jhayati means both to burn and to meditate, though the two meanings are deriyed from different Sanskrit verbs: kshayati is to bum, dhyayati to meditate. 1185 Abhiya's words are discourteous because they inquire very directly into the personal experience of Yen. Anuruddha. MA says that while fulfilling the perfections (paramzs) in past lives, Anuruddha had gone forth as a recluse, reached the meditative attainments, and passed three hundred existences without interruption in the Brahma-world. Hence his reply. SUTIA 128 1186 The opening of this sutta is the same as that of MN 48. 1187 This verse and the next two appear at Dhp 3, 5-6. The last three verses appear at Dhp 328-30. 1188 The passage at §§8--15 is nearly identical with MN 31.3-10. From the sequel, however, it is clear that the present sutta is set at an earlier time, for in MN 31 all three bhikkhus have reached arahantship while here they are still striv-ing for the goal. 1189 It is here that the present sutta continues differently from MN 31. MA explains light (obhasa) as the preliminary light, which MT glosses as the light· produced by the access to jhana. MT adds that one who gains the fourth jhana develops the light-kasil)a as the preliminary to arousing the divine eye. The \"vision of forms\" (dassanam rupanam) is the seeing of forms with the divine eye. Yen. Anuruddha was later declared by the Buddha to be the foremost disciple in the exercise of the divine eye. 1190 Nimittam pativijjhitabbam. Lit. \"You should penetrate that sign.\" 1191 See MN 52.15. 1192 MA paraphrases: \"While I was attending to a single type of form, longing arose. Thinking 'I will attend to different kinds of forms,' sometimes I directed my attention towards the heavenly world, sometimes towards the human world. As I attended to different kinds of forms, perception of diversity arose in me.\" Notes to Suttas 128 and 129 1335 1193 Atinijjhayitattam rupanam. MA: \"When perception of diversity arose, I thought I would attend to one type of form, whether agreeable or disagreeable. As I did so, excessive meditation upon forms arose in me.\" 1194 Cittassa upakkileso. The same term is used at MN 7.3, though here it means not so much defilements of the mind as imperfections in the development of concentra-tion. Hence the expression has been rendered slightly dif-ferently in the two cases. 1195 The \"three ways\" seem to be the first three types of con-centration mentioned in the next paragraph, also spoken of as a triad at DN 33.1.lO/iii.219. Of these, the first is the first jhana and the third covers the three higher jhanas of the usual fourfold scheme. The second type of concentra-tion has no place in the fourfold scheme, but appears as the second jhana in a fivefold division of jhanas expounded in the Abhidhamma Pitaka. This second jhana of the fivefold scheme is attained by those who cannot overcome applied thought and sustained thought simultaneously but must eliminate them successively. 1196 MA: The concentration with rapture is the two lower jhanas; without rapture, the two higher jhanas; accompa-nied by enjoyment (silta), the three lower jhanas; accom-panied by equanimity, the fourth jhana. 1197 MA says that the Buddha developed these concentrations in the last watch of the night on the night of his enlight-enment while sitting at the foot of the Bodhi tree.

The legend of the Wheel-turning Monarch is treated more extensively in DN 17 and DN 26. 1204 See n.809. 1205 MA: That is, the wise man engages in the three types of good conduct, because of which he is reborn in heaven. Returning to the human world, he is reborn in a good family with wealth and beauty. He engages in the three types of good conduct and is again reborn in heaven. It should be noted that the \"complete perfection of the wise man's grade\" is entirely mundane and takes no account of the more excellent stages along the path to liberation. SUITA 130 1206 Yama is the god of death. MA says that he is a king of spirits possessing a celestial mansion. Sometimes he lives in his celestial mansion enjoying celestial pleasures, sometimes he experiences the result of kamma; he is a righteous king. MA adds that there are in fact four Yamas, one at each of four gates (of hell?). 1207 According to Buddhist legend, three Of the divine mes-sengers -the old'man, the sick man, and the dead man -appeared to the Bodhisatta while he was living in the palace, destroying his enchantment with the worldly l~fe and awakening in him a desire to seek the way to deliv-erance. See AN 3:38/i.145-46 for the psychological nu-cleus out of which the legend must have developed. 1208 The following description of hell, down to §16, is also found at MN 129.10-16. SurrA 131 1209 This discourse with a lengthy introduction and no:es is available separately in a translation by Bhikkhu NaDa-nand a under the title Ideal Solitude. Notes to Sutta 131 1337 1210 Ms contains the following note by Nm on this expres-sion, which accounts for the title of this and the following three suttas: This term has elsewhere been translated by \"true saint\" and like phrases, which, however, quite miss the point. The commentary says only this: \"Bhaddekarattassa means 'of one who is fortunate (bhadda) in having one (eka) attachment (ratta or ratti)'; this is because of his possessing applica-tion to insight.\" The subcommentary resolves the compound ekaratta (one-attachment) into ektt ratti, and says only that \"bhaddekaratta means one who has a fortunate single attachment (bhaddo ekaratto etassa); it is a term for a person who is cultivating insight.\" There appears to be no other mention of this term elsewhere in the Canon and its commentaries. The Pali word ratta (adj.) or ratti (n.) in this instance is from the root raj, \"to take pleasure in.\" So the \"bhaddekaratta\" appears to be the one who is applying himself invincibly, unshakeably, to know and to study the present state as it occurs (see verse). This application of attachment is auspi-cious or fortunate because it leads to liberation ... It might be supposed that the expression \"bhad-dekaratta\" was a popular phrase taken over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not infrequently done, but there seems to be no reason to do so and there is no evidence for it in this case. It is more likely to be a term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of development. Yen. N3Dananda, in the introduction to his translation, offers an argument for rendering the term \"the ideal lover of solitude.\" Homer renders it simply as \"the Auspicious.\" 1211 More literally the first two lines would be translated: \"Let not a person run back to the past or live in expecta-tion of the future.\" The meaning will be elucidated in the expository passage of the sutta."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"1338 The Majjhima Nikiiya 1212 MA: He should contemplate each presently arisen state, just where it has arisen, with insight into its imperma-nence, etc. 1213 Asamhrram asankuppam. MA explains that this is said for the purpose of showing insight and repeated insight; for insight is \"invincible, unshakeable\" because it is not van-quished or shaken by lust and other defilements. Else-where the expression \"the invincible, the unshakeable\" is used as a description of Nibbana (e.g., Sn v.1149) or of the liberated mind (e.g., Thag v.649), but here it seems to refer to a stage in the development of insight. The recur-rence of the verb form samhfrati in §8 and §9 suggests that the intended meaning is contemplation of the pre-sent moment without being misled into the adoption of a personality view. 1214 The \"Peaceful Sage\" (santo muni) is the Buddha. 1215 MA: One \"finds delight\" by bringing to bear upon the past either craving or a view associated with craving. It should be noted that it is not the mere recollection of the past through memory that causes bondage, but the reliv-ing of past experiences with thoughts of craving. In this respect the Buddha's teaching differs significantly from that of Krishnamurti, who seems to regard memory itself as the villain behind the scene. 1216 Perhaps this sentence, and all the parallel sentences to follow, should be translated: \"One does not find delight there thinking, 'Y had such material form in the past.'\" The translation as it stands suggests that such thoughts arise but without the accompaniment of delight, while the alternative proposed here suggests that these thoughts do not arise at all. The same alternative con-struction can also be applied to thoughts about the future in §7. The Pali can admit either rendering. 1217 Perhaps this phrase should be taken as an exclamation: \"May I have such material form in the future!\" 1218 The verb here and in the next paragraph, samhIrati, refers back to the line in the verse, \"invincibly, unshakeably.\" MA glosses: \"One is dragged in by craving and views because of the lack of insight.\" Notes to Suttas 133-135 1339 SurrA 133 1219 Down to §12, as at MN18.10-15. 1220 MA: In the two previous suttas and in the one to follow the Buddha set up the outline and analysis by way of the five aggregates, but here he set it up in order for it to be analysed by way of the twelve sense bases. Understand-ing the Buddha's intention, Yen. Maha Kaccana spoke as he did, and because of his skill in grasping the method even when it was not explicitly shown, the Buddha appointed him the foremost disciple in explaining in detail a teaching stated in brief. SurrA 134 1221 According to the commentary to Thag, Yen. Lomasakan-giya had been a bhikkhu in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. After the Buddha Kassapa had taught the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, a certain bhikkhu spoke about it to Lomasakangiya. Unable to understand it, he exclaimed: \"In the future, may I be able to teach you this sutta!\" The other answered: \"May I ask you about it!\" In the present age Lomasakangiya was born into a Sakyan family at Kapilavatthu, while the other bhikkhu became the god Candana. 1222 MA explains that this occurred in the seventh year after the Buddha's enlightenment, at the time when he spent the three months of the rainy season in the heaven of the Thirty-three teaching the Abhidhamma to the gods who had assembled from ten thousand world-systems. surrA 135 1223 See MN 99. According to MA, his father, the brahmin Todeyya, was reborn as a dog in his own house because of his extreme stinginess. The Buddha identified him to Subha by getting the dog to dig up some hidden treasure Subha's father had buried before his death. This inspired Subha's confidence in the Buddha and moved him to approach and inquire about the workings of kamma. 1224 If the kamma of killing directly determines the mode of ~--------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"1340 The Majjhima Nikllya rebirth, it will produce rebirth in one of the states of deprivation. But if a wholesome kamma brings about a human rebirth -and rebirth as a human being is always the result of wholesome h,mma - the kamma of killing will operate in a manner contrary to that of the rebirth-generative kamma by causing various adversities that may reach their peak in a premature death. The same principle holds for the subsequent cases in which unwholesome kamma comes to maturity in a human existence: in each case the unwholesome kamma counter-acts the wholesome kamma responsible for the human rebirth by engendering a specific type of misfortune cor-responding to its own distinctive quality. 1225 In this case the wholesome kamma of abstaining from killing may be directly responsible for either the heavenly rebirth or the longevity in a human existence. The same principle applies in all the passages on the maturation of wholesome kamma. SVITA 136 1226 MA says that Potaliputta did not actually hear this per-sonally from the Buddha, but had heard a report that these statements were made by the Buddha. The former is a distorted version of the Buddha's' declaration at MN 56.5 that mental action is the most reprehensible of the three types of deeds for the performance of evil action. The latter derives from the Buddha's discussion of the cessation of perception in the Potthapiida Sutta (DN 9). MA glosses the word \"vain\" by \"fruitless.\" 1227 This statement is made by the Buddha at SN 36:11/ iv.216, with reference to the suffering inherent in all formations by reason of their impermanence. Though the statement itself is true, Samiddhi seems to have misinterpreted it to mean that all feeling is felt as suffering, which is patently false. 1228 MA: This section is not the expounding of the Tathagata's knowledge of the great exposition of action, but the setting up of the outline for the purpose of pre-senting that exposition. 1229 MA: This too is not the expounding of the knowledge of Notes to Sutta 136 1341 the great exposition of action, but is still the setting up of the outline. The purpose here is to show what can be accepted and what should be rejected in the claims of the outside reciuses and brahmins. Briefly put, the proposi-tions they put forth reporting their direct observations can be accepted, but the generalisations they derive from those observations must be rejected. 1230 Here begins the expounding of the know ledge of the great exposition of action. 1231 MA: The person who was seen with the divine eye killing living beings, etc., is reborn in hell because of another evil deed he had done earlier than the deed of killing, etc., or because of an evil deed he did afterwards, or because of a wrong view he accepted at the time of death. Although the Pitli seems to be saying that he was necessarily reborn in hell on account of some action other than the one he was seen performing, this should not be understood as an apodictic pronouncement but only as a statement of possibility. That is, while it may be true that he was reborn in hell because of the evil action he was seen performing, it is also possible that he was reborn there because of some other evil action he did earlier or later or because of wrong view. 1232 This statement shows that even if his evil kamma does not generate the mode of rebirth, it will still mature for him in some other way either in this life, in the next life, or in some more distant future life. 1233 In this case the heavenly rebirth must be due to some action other than the one he was seen performing, since an evil action cannot produce a fortunate mode of rebirth .. 1234 MA: The first is illustrated by the person who kills living beings and is reborn in hell: his action is incapable (of good result) because it is unwholesome, and it appears incapable because, since he is reborn in hell, it seems to be the cause for his rebirth there. The second is illustrated by the person who kills living beings and is reborn in heaven: his action is incapable (of good result) because it is unwholesome, yet it appears capable because he is reborn in heaven; thus to the outside recluses and brahmins it seems to be the cause for his rebirth in heav-"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"1342 The Majjhima Nikaya en. The remaining two terms should be understood along the same lines, with appropriate changes. SUTTA 137 1235 MA: Mental exploration (manopavicara) is applied thought and sustained thought. One explores (or examines, upa-vicarati) the object by the occurrence of sustained thought (vicilra), and applied thought is associated with the iatter. 1236 MA: Having seen a form with eye-consciousness, one explores a form Which, as an object, is a cause of joy (grief, equanimity). 1237 MA: These are positions (pada) for beings who are intent on the round of existence and for those intent on the ces-sation of the round. 1238 MA: \"Based on the household life\" means connected with the cords of sensual pleasure; \"based on renuncia-tion\" means connected with insight. 1239 MA: This is the joy that arises when one has set up insight and is sitting watching the breakup of formations with a current of sharp and bright insight knowledge focused on formations. 1240 MA explains \"the supreme liberations\" and \"that base\" as arahantship. See MN 44.28. 1241 MA: This is the equanimity of unknowing that arises in one who has not conquered the limitations imposed by the defilements or the future results (of action). It \"does not transcend the form\" because it is stuck, fastened to the object like flies to a ball of sugar. 1242 MA: This is the equanimity associated with insight knowledge. It does not become lustful towards desirable objects that come into range of the senses, nor does it become angry be~ause of undesirable objects. 1243 MA says that previously worldly equanimity was dis-cussed, but here the contrast is between the equanimity in differentiated sense experience and the equanimity of the meditative attainments. 1244 MA paraphrases: \"By the equanimity of the immaterial attainments, abandon the equanimity of the fine-material attainments; by insight into the immaterial sphere, aban-don insight into the fine-material sphere.\" Notes to Suttas 137 and 138 1343 1245 MA says that non-identification (atammayata -see n.l066) here refers to \"insight leading to emergence,\" i.e., the insight immediately preceding the arising of the supra-mundane path; for this effects the abandonment of the equanimity of the immaterial attainments and the equa-nimity of insight. 1246 Satipatthiina here obviously has a different meaning than usual, as the sequel will make clear. The \"Noble One\" is the Buddha. 1247 This is one of the nine epithets of the Buddha in the usual enumeration of the Buddha's qualities. 1248 These \"eight directions\" are the eight liberations, on which see n .764. SUTTA 138 1249 It is strange that the Buddha, having announced that he will teach a summary and an exposition, should recite only the summary and leave without giving the exposi-tion. Although elsewhere the Buddha departs suddenly after making an enigmatic statement (e.g., in MN 18), on those occasions he had not previously declared his inten-tion to give an exposition. MA offers no explanation. 1250 MA: Consciousness is \"distracted and scattered external-ly,\" i.e., among external objects, when it occurs by way of attachment towards an external object. 1251 MT: The form itself is called the sign of form (rflpanimitta) in that it is the cause for the arising of defilements. One \"follows after it\" by way of lust. 1252 MA: The mind is \"stuck internally\" by way of attachment to an internal object. The text of the sutta itself makes the shift from viiiiialJa in the Buddha's summary to citta in Maha Kaccana's exposition. 1253 All known editions of the Pali text of MN 138 read here anupllda paritassana, literally \"agitation due to non-clinging,\" which obviously contradicts what the B~ddha consistently teaches: that agitation arises from clinging, and ceases with the removal of clinging. However, this reading apparently precedes the time of the commen-taries, for MA accepts anupadtl as correct and offers the fol-lowing explanation: \"In what sense is there agitation due"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"1344 The Majjhima Nikaya to non-clinging?·Through the non-existence of anything to cling to. For if there existed any formation that were per-manent, stable, a self, or the belonging of a self, it would be possible to cling to it. Then this agitation would be agi-tation due to clinging (something to cling to). But because there is no formation that can be clung to thus, then even though material form, etc., are clung to with the idea 'material form is self,' etc., they are not clung to (in the way they are conceived). Thus, what is here called 'agita-tion due to non-clinging' is in meaning agitation due to clinging by way of views.\" Nm had followed this reading, and on the basis of MA's explanation, had rendered the phrase \"anguish [agitation] due to not finding anything to cling to.\" He did not discuss the problem in his notes. A sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya (SN 22:7/iii, 16) is vir-tually identical with this passage of MN 138, except that here it reads, as we should expect, upada paritassana, \"agi-tation due to clinging.\" From the Samyutta text we may safely infer that the Majjhima reading is an ancient error that should be discounted. My rendering here is based on the reading of SN 22:7. Homer too follows the latter text inMLS. 1254 MA explains the unusual phrase paritassana dham-masamuppada as \"the agitation of craving and the arising of (other) unwholesome states.\" 1255 The agitation thus results from the lack of any permanent essence in things that could provide a refuge from the suffering precipitated by their change and instability. 1256 This phrase is identical in both the Majjhima and Sam-yutta versions. SUITA 139 1257 This is substantially identical with the proclamation with which the newly enlightened Buddha opened his first discourse to the five bhikkhus, before teaching them the Four Noble Truths. 1258 This is a more complicated expression for the pursuit of sensual pleasure. 1259 MA: It is \"beset by suffering, vexation,\" etc., through the Notes to Suttas 139 and 140 1345 suffering and vexation, etc., of its results and the suffer-ing and vexation, etc., of its attendant defilements. 1260 This is craving for being. 1261 That is, extolling and disparaging come about when one frames one's statements in terms of persons, some of whom are praised and others blamed. One teaches \"only the Dhamma\" when one frames one's statements in terms of the state (dhamma) -the mode of practice - with-out explicit references to persons. 1262 This problem of \"insistence on local language\" must have been particularly acute in the Sangha, when the bhikkhus lived a life of constant wandering and had to pass through many localities each with their distinct dialects. 1263 Yen. Subho.ti was the younger brother of AnathapiJ:t<;lika and became a bhikkhu on the day Jeta's Grove was offered to the Sangha. The Buddha appointed him the foremost disciple in two categories - those who live with-out conflict and those who are worthy of gifts. SUITA 140 1264 According to MA, Pukkusati had been the king of Takkasila and had entered into a friendship with King Bimbisara of Magadha through merchants who travelled between the two countries for purposes of trade. In an exchange of gifts Bimbisara sent Pukkusati a golden plate on which he had inscribed descriptions of the Three Jewels and various aspects of the Dhamma. When Pukkusati read the inscription, he was filled with joy and decided to renounce the world. Without taking formal ordination, he shaved his head, put on yellow robes, and left the palace. He went to Rajagaha intending to meet the Buddha, who was then in SavatthI, about 300 miles away. The Buddha Saw Pukkusati with his clairvoyant knowledge, and recognising his capacity to attain the paths and fruits, he journeyed alone on foot to Rajagaha to meet him. To avoid being recognised, by an act of will the Buddha caused his special physical attributes such as the marks of a Great Man to be concealed, and he appeared just like an ordinary wandering monk. He"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"1346 The Majjhima Nikiiya arrived at the potter's shed shortly after Pukkusati had arrived there intending to leave for SavatthI the next day in order to meet the Buddha. 1265 Pukkusati, unaware that .the new arrival is the Buddha, addresses him by the familiar appellation \"avuso.\" 1266 MA: The Buddha asked these questions merely as a way to start a conversation, as he already knew that Puk-kusati had gone forth on account of himself. 1267 MA: Since Pukkusati had already purified the prelimi-nary practice of the path and was able to attain the fourth jhana through mindfulness of breathing, the Buddha began directly with a talk on insight meditation, expounding the ultimate voidness that is the foundation for arahantship. 1268 MA: Here the Buddha expounds the non-truly existent by way of the truly existent; for the elements are truly existent but the person is not truly existent. This is meant: \"That which you perceive as a person consists of six elements. Ultimately there is no person here. 'Person' is a mere concept.\" 1269 As at MN 137.8. 1270 Pafifitidhitthtina, sacctidhitthtina, ctigtidhitthtina, upasam-adhitthlina. Nm, in Ms, had first rendered adhitthana as \"resolve,\" and then replaced it with \"mode of expres-sion,\" neither of which seems suitable for this context. MA glosses the word with patittha, which clearly means foundation, and explains the sense of the statement thus: \"This person who consists of the six elements, the six bases of contact, and the eighteen kinds of mental approach -when he tums away from these and attains arahantship, the supreme accomplishment, he does so established upon these four bases.\" The four foundations will be individually elucidated by the sequel, §§12-29. 1271 MA: From the start one should not neglect the wisdom born of concentration and insight in order to penetrate through to the wisdom of the fruit of arahantship. One should preserve truthful speech in order to realise Nibbana, the ultimate truth. One should cultivate the relinquishment of defilements in order to accomplish the relinquishing of all defilements by the path of ara-Notes to Sutta 140 1347 hantship. From the start one should train in the pacifica-tion of defilements in order to pacify all defilements by the path of arahantship. Thus the wisdom, etc., born of serenity and insight are spoken of as the preliminary foundations for achieving the foundations of wisdom, etc. (distinctive ot arahantship). 1272 MA: The non-neglecting of wisdom is explained by way of the meditation on the elements. The analysis of the ele-ments here is identical with that of MN 28.6, 11, 16, 21 and MN 62.8-12. 1273 MA: This is the sixth element, which \"remains\" in that it has yet to be expounded by the Buddha and penetrated by Pukkusati. Here it is explained as the consciousness that accomplishes the work of insight contemplation on the elements. Under the heading of consciousness, the contemplation of feeling is also introduced. 1274 This passage shows the conditionality of feeling and its impermanence through the cessation of its condition. 1275 MA identifies this as the equanimity of the fourth jhana. According to MA, Pukkusati had already achieved the fourth jhana and had a strong attachment to it. The Buddha first praises this equanimity to inspire Puk-kusati's confidence, then he gradually leads him to the immaterial jhanas and the attainment of the paths and fruits. 1276 The sense is: If he attains the base of infinite space and should pass away while still attached to it, he would be reborn in the plane of infinite space and would live there for the full lifespan of 20,000 aeons specified for that plane. In the higher three immaterial planes the lifespan is respectively 40,000 aeons, 60,000 aeons, and 84,000 aeons: 1277 MA: This is said in order to show the danger in the immaterial jhanas. By the one phrase, \"This would be conditioned,\" he shows: \"Even though the lifespan there is 20,000 aeons, that is conditioned, fashioned, built up. It is thus impermanent, unstable, not lasting, transient. It is subject to perishing, breaking up, and dissolution; it is involved with birth, ageing, and death, grounded upon suffering. It is not a shelter, a place of safety, a refuge.

The two verbs suggest the notion of volition as a constnictive power that builds up the continuation of conditioned existence. Ceasing to will for either being or non-being shows the extinction of craving for eternal existence and annihilation, culminating in the attainment of arahantship. 1279 MA says that at this point Pukkusati penetrated three paths and fruits, becoming a non-returner. He realised that his teacher was the Buddha himself, but he could not express his realisation since the Buddha still continued with his discourse. 1280 This passage shows the arahant's abiding in the Nibbana element with a residue remaining (of the factors of condi-tioned existence, sa-upadisesa nibbanadhatu). Though he continues to experience feelings, he is free from lust towards pleasant feeling, from aversion towards painful feeling, and from ignorance about neutral feeling. 1281 That is, he continues to experience feeling only as long as the body with its life faculty continues, but not beyond that. 1282 This refers to his attainment of the Nibbana-element with no residue remaining (anuplidisesa nibbanadhatu) -the cessation of all conditioned existence with his final passing away. 1283 This completes the exposition of the first foundation, which began at §13. MA says that the knowledge of the destruction of all suffering is the wisdom pertaining to the fruit of arahantship. 1284 MA mentions four kinds of attachment (upadhi) here: see n.674. 1285 The \"tides of conceiving\" (mafifiussavil), as the following paragraph will show, are thoughts and notions originat-ing from the three roots of conceiving -craving, conceit, and views. For a fuller explanation, see n.6. The \"sage at peace\" (muni santo) is the arahant. 1286 That which is not present in him is craving for being, which leads those who have not eradicated it back to a new birth following death. Notes to 5uttas 140-142 1349 1287 MA says that he was reborn in the Pure Abode called Aviha and attained arahantship as soon as he took rebirth the~e. It quote~ a ~erse from the. Saril~utta Nikaya (SN 1:50/1.35) mentIonmg PukkusatI as one of seven bhikkhus who were reborn in Aviha and attained deliv-erance by transcending the celestial bonds. SUTTA 141 1288 This refers to the Buddha's first sermon, delivered to the five bhikkhus in the Deer Park at Isipatana. 1289 MA: Yen. Sariputta trains them until he knows they have attained the fruit of stream-entry, then he lets them develop the higher paths on their own and he takes on a new batch of pupils. But Yen. Moggallana continues to train his pupils until they have attained arahantship. 1290 The definitions of birth, ageing, and death are also found at MN 9.22, 26. This entire detailed analysis of the Four Noble Truths is included in the Mahasatipatthana 5utta, with an even more elaborate exposition of the second and third truths. See DN 22.18-21/ii.305-13. SUTTA 142 1291 MahapajapaU GotamI was the younger sister of Queen Mahamaya, the Buddha's mother, and was also the wife of King Suddhodana. After Mahamaya's death, she became the Buddha's foster mother. The present sutta takes place at an early point in the Buddha's ministry, on one of his retlirn visits to his native city. After King Suddhodana's death; MahapajapaU pleaded with the Buddha to admit' women into the Sangha, and her acceptance marked the beginning of the BhikkhunI Sangha, the Order of Nuns. The story is found at Yin Cv Kh 10/ii.253-56 (see NaDamoli, The Life of the Buddha, pp. 104-7). 1292 MA: The Buddha asked her to give the gift to the Sangha because he wanted her volition of generosity to be directed both to the Sangha and to himself, as the combined voli-tion would yield merit conducive to her welfare and hap-piness for a long time to come. He also said this in order"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"1350 The Majjhima Nikiiya that later generations would be inspired to show respect towards the Sangha, and by supporting the Sangha with the four physical requisites would contribute towards the <;> longevity of the Dispensation. 1293 These are the four factors of stream-entry. Thus it is clear that at the time this sutta takes place, MahapajapatI GotamI was already a stream-enterer. 1294 MA: The Buddha undertakes this teaching because the sutta began with a personal gift presented to him, and he wishes to make clear the comparative value of personal gifts and gifts offered to the Sangha. 1295 MA and MT explain that this term can be loosely extend-ed to include even a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Triple Gem, as well as lay people and monks intent on fulfilling the moral training and the practice of con-centration and insight. In the strict technical sense it refers only to those possessing the supramundane path of stream-entry. 1296 This is a non-Buddhist contemplative who attains the jhanas and the mundane kinds of direct knowledge. 1297 MA: In a hundred existences it gives long life, beauty, happiness, strength, and intelligence, and it makes one free of agitation. The following attainments should be understood accordingly. 1298 MA says that although the results of giving in each of these cases is incalculable, there is still an ascending gra-dation in their incalculability, similar to the ascending incalculability of the waters in a great river, etc., up to that of the waters in the ocean. Perhaps the \"incalculable, immeasurable\" value of these gifts consists in their becoming a supporting condition for attainment of the paths, fruits, and Nibbana. 1299 MA: There is no gift equal in measure to this gift. This is the kind of gift MahapajapatI would be giving by offer-ing the pair of cloths to the Sangha. 1300 MA: \"Members of the clan\" (gotrabhuno) are those who are monks merely in name. They will go about with a piece of yellow cloth tied around their necks or arms, and will support their wives and children by engaging in trade and farming, etc. 1301 The gift is incalculable and immeasurable in value Notes to Suttas 142 and 143 1351 because it is offered, by way of the intention of the donor, not to the \"yellow-necks\" as individuals but to the Sangha as a corporate whole. Thus the recipient body includes all the virtuous bhikkhus of the past, even those who have long passed away. 1302 MA states that a gift offered to an immoral bhikkhu taken to represent the entire Sangha is more fruitful than a gift offered on a personal basis to an arahant. But for the gift to be properly presented to the Sangha, the donor must take no account of the personal qualities of the recipient but must see him solely as representing the Sangha as a whole. 1303 MA: Here the word \"purified\" has the meaning \"made fruitful.\" 1304 MA: This last verse refers to the gift one arahant gives to another arahant. Although the arahant believes in the fruit of kamma, because he is without desire and lust for existence his own act of giving is not productive of any fruits. It is a mere functional action (kiriya) that leaves no traces behind. SUITA 143 1305 MA says that clinging to the eye takes place by way of desire and lust; consciousness is dependent on the eye by way of craving and views. However, since Anatha-pi1).<;iika was already a stream-enterer, dependence for him would have involved only craving, views having been eradicated by the path of stream-entry. 1306 This statement does not imply that there is any inherent exclusiveness or arbitrary discrimination in the Buddha's way of presenting his teaching. But as those who remain in lay life must look after their families, possessions, and occupations, such talk leading to complete detachment would not have been appropriate for them. SVITA 144 1307 This is an elliptical expression for committing suicide. 1308 By making this statement he is implicitly claiming ara-hantship, as will be made clear at §13. Whether his claim"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"1352 The Majjhima Nikaya at this point was valid or not is uncertain, the commen-tary regarding it as a case of self-overestimation. 1309 MA says that Yen. Maha Cunda gave him this instruc-tion thinking that he must still be an ordinary person, since he could not endure the deadly pains and wanted to commit suicide. 1310 The sense of this instruction might be explained with the help of MA thus: One is dependent because of craving and views and becomes independent by abandoning them with the attainment of arahantship. Bias (nati, lit. bending) comes about through craving, and its absence means there is no inclination or desire for existence. There is no coming and going by the ending of rebirth and death, no here nor beyond nor in between by the transcendence of this world, the world beyond, and the passage between one and the other. This is the end of the suffering of defilements and the suffering of the round. 1311 MA: He cut his throat, and just at that moment the fear of death descended on him and the sign of future rebirth appeared. Recognising that he was still an ordinary per-son, he was aroused and developed insight. Compre-hending the formations, he attained arahantship just before he expired. 1312 MA: Although the Yen. Channa was still an ordinary person at the time he made the declaration, because he attained final Nibbana immediately afterwards, the Buddha spoke thus referring to that same declaration. 1313 Upavajjakuliini. It seems from MA and MT that Channa had associated closely with his lay supporters in ways that were not proper for a monk, and even though he was intent on the right practice, this intimacy had aroused suspicion within the Sangha. 1314 This statement seems to imply that Channa was an ara-hant at the time he committed suicide, though the com-mentary explains otherwise. SUTIA 145 1315 This PU1)1).a is a different person from PUDJ:la MantaI).i-putta of MN 24. He was from a family of merchants residing in the port city of Supparaka in the Sunaparanta Notes to Suttas 145 and 146 1353 country (present-day Maharashtra). On a business trip to SavatthI he heard the Buddha give a discourse and renounced the home life to become a bhikkhu. 1316 MA explains this instruction as a short tea~hing on the Four Noble Truths. Delight (nandr) is an aspect of crav-ing. Through the arising of delight in regard to the eye and forms there arises the suffering of the five aggre-gates. Thus in this first part of the instruction the Buddha teaches the round of existence by way of the first two truths -suffering and its origin -as they occur through the six senses. In the second part (§4) he teaches the end-ing of the round by way of the second two truths -cessa-tion and the path -expressed as the abandoning of delight in the six senses and their objects. 1317 That is, he expired. Since the Buddha still refers to PUDJ:la as a clansman (kulaputta), he must have died within a short time after returning to the Sunaparanta country. The texts leave no record of how he died. SUITA 146 1318 One of the eight important rules laid down by the Buddha when he established the BhikkhunI Sangha stip-ulated that every fortnight the bhikkhunIs should request the bhikkhus to send a bhikkhu for the purpose of giving them an exhortation. According to MA, in a previous life Yen. Nandaka had been a king and those bhikkhurus had been his concubines. He wanted to avoid his tum in advising the bhikkhunIs because he thought that another bhikkhu possessing the knowledge of past lives, seeing him giving an exhortation surrounded by the bhikkhunIs, would think that he still could not separate himself from his former concubines. But the Buddha saw that Nandaka's discourse to the bhikkhunls would bene-fit them and thus he requested him to instruct them. 1319 MA: They have seen this with the wisdom of insight. 1320 TaJjam tajjam paccayam paticca tajjii tajjii vedanii uppajjanti. The coming together of the eye, forms, and eye-conscious-ness is eye-contact, and this is the primary condition for the arising of feeling born of eye-contact.

Thus eye-conta~t ceases, and with its ces-sation the feeling born of eye-contact also ceases. 1321 MA: .H~ undertakes this teaching on the enlightenment factors because wisdom is not able to cut away the defile-ments by itself, but only when accompanied by the other six enlightenment factors (wisdom being equivalent to the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor). 1322 MA: She who was last in regard to good qualities had become a stream-enterer, but those whose intentions were to become once-returners, non-returners, and ara-hants each achieved the fulfilment of their intentions. Because of these results, the Buddha named Ven. Nandaka the foremost bhikkhu in instructing the bhikkhurus. SurrA 147 1323 MA says that this discourse was spoken to Rahula shortly after his higher ordination, presumably at the age of twenty. 1324 Vimuttiparipacanfyii dhammii. MA mentions fifteen states that ripen in deliverance: the five spiritual faculties; the five penetrative insights -into impermanence, suffering, non-self, abandoning, and fading away; and the five things taught to Meghiya -noble friendship, virtue, ben-eficial discussion, energy, and wisdom (see AN 9:3/ iv.356; Ud 4:1/36). 1325 MA says that these deities, who came from various celes-tial realms, had been companions of Rahula's during the previous life in which he first made the aspiration to attain arahantship as the son of a Buddha. 1326 It should be noted that the last four items mentioned are the four mental aggregates. Thus this discourse covers not only the sense bases but also the five aggregates, the aggregate of material form being implied by the physical sense faculties and their objects. 1327 According to MA, stream-entry was the minimal attain-ment of those deities, but some attained the higher paths and fruits up to arahantship. Notes to Suttas 147 and 148 1355 SUTTA 148 1328 This string of epithets, usually descriptions of the Dhamma as a whole, here serves to emphasise the impor-tance of the discourse the Buddha is about to deliver. 1329 The last two clauses in this sequence are also found in the standard formulation of dependent origination, which is thus implicitly incorporated into this discourse on the six sets of six. . 1330 The verb upapajjati (the PTS ed. reading, uppajjati, is an error), normally means \"reappears\" or \"is reborn,\" but it also has a special usage in logic whereby it means \"to be tenable, to be acceptable,\" as it does here. 1331 The argument derives the principle of non-self from the verifiable premise of impermanence. The structure of the argument may be briefly set out thus: Whatever is self must be permanent; X is directly perceived to be imperma-nent, i.e., marked by rise and fall; therefore X is not self. 1332 The full argument of the previous paragraph is repeated for each of the remaining five terms in each set of six. 1333 MA explains that this passage is stated to show two noble truths -suffering and its origin -by way of the three obsessions (gaha). The truth of suffering is shown by the term \"personality,\" elsewhere explicated as the five aggre-gates affected by clinging (MN 44.2). The three obsessions are craving, conceit, and views, which respectively give rise to the notions \"mine,\" \"1 am\" and \"my self.\" The two truths together constitute the round of existence. 1334 MA: This passage is stated to show the other two noble truths - cessation and the path -by the repudiation of the three obsessions. These two truths constitute the end:' ing of the round. 1335 MA: This passage shows the round of existence once again, this time by way of the underlying tendencies. On the underlying tendencies and their correlation with the three types of feeling, see MN 44.25-28. 1336 MA: The first-mentioned ignorance is only the lack of understanding of the origination, etc., of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The second-mentioned is the igno-rance that is at the root of the round. 1337 MA: There is nothing wonderful in the fact that sixty"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"1356 The Mo.jjhima Nikaya bhikkhus attained arahantship when the Buddha first taught this sutta. But each time Sariputta, Moggallana, and .t~e eighty great disciples taught it, sixty bhikkhus attained arahantship. In Sri Lanka the Elder Maliyadeva taught this sutta in sixty places, and each time sixty bhikkhus attained arahantship. But when the Elder Tipitaka Culanaga taught this sutta to a vast assembly of humans and gods, at the end of the discourse a thousand bhikkhus attained arahantship, and among the gods only one remained a worldling. SUITA 149 1338 MA: When one does not know and see the eye by way of insight knowledge and path knowledge. 1339 That is, the craving that arises and settles on the eye and forms, etc., holds to them with clinging, and this brings about an accumulation of kamma that tends to generate a new set of five aggregates in the next existence. 1340 When one knows and sees the eye by insight and the path. 1341 The eight factors of the path mentioned here seem to pertain to the preliminary or mundane portion of the path. MT identifies them with the factors possessed by a person at the highest level of insight development, immediately prior to the emergence of the supramun-dane path. In thls stage only the former five path factors are actively operative, the three factors of the morality group having been purified prior to the undertaking of insight meditation. But when the supramundane path arises, all eight factors occur simultaneously, the three factors of the morality group exercising the function of eradicating the defilements responsible for moral trans-gression in speech, action, and livelihood. 1342 MA says that this refers to the simultaneous arising of serenity and insight in the supramundane path. The for-mer is present under the heading of right concentration, the latter under the heading of right view. 1343 These are the four functions exercised by the supramun-dane path: fully understanding the truth of suffering, abandoning the cause of suffering, realising the cessation Notes to Suttas 149 and 151 1357 of suffering, and developing the path leading to the end of suffering. 1344 Here serenity and insight represent the entire Noble Eightfold Path. . 1345 MA identifies \"true knowledge\" with the knowledge of the path of arahantship, \"deliverance\" with the fruit of arahantship. Here these take the place usually reserved for Nibbana, the true cessation of suffering. 1346 This passage and each of the following passages repeat the entire text of §§9-11, the only change being in the sense facul ty and object. SUITA 151 1347 MA: The arahant's fruition attainment of voidness. See n.458 and n.1144. 1348 1349 1350 1351 MA: This is the abiding of such great men (mahapurisa) as Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and the great disciples of the Tathagatas. Among the five terms, desire and lust are synonymous as are hate and aversion. Beginning with this section a sequence of development may be discerned. The abandoning of the five cords of sensual pleasure is the preliminary step for developing the jhanas, and the abandoning of the five hindrances (§1O) the immediate antecedent to the attainment of the first jhana. The full understanding of the five aggregates (§11) indicates the insight wisdom necessary to attain the path of stream-entry, and the sections on the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment (§§12-18) the cultivation of the factors needed to arrive at the intermediate stages 'of sanctity. The section on serenity and insight (§19), though applicable to all stages, can be seen as fully actualised by the non-returner striving for arahantship. Finally, the sec-tion on true knowledge and deliverance signifies the attainment of the path and fruit of arahantship. Although the arahant, who has fully realised true knowl-edge and deliverance, has no need for further training, he continues to cultivate serenity and insight in order to enter into the bliss of the jhanas, the fruition attainment of"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"1358 The Majjhima Nikaya arahantship, and the cessation of perception and feeling. SVTIA 152 1352 The expression \"the development of the faculties\" (indriyabhavana) properly signifies the development oj the mind in responding to the objects experienced through the sense faculties. The more rudimentary aspect of this practice, the restraint of the sense faculties (indriya-samvara), involves controlling the mind in such a way that one does not grasp at the \"signs and features\" of things, their distinctive attractive and repulsive attributes. The development of the faculties carries this process of control through to the point where, by an act of will, one can immediately set up insight even in the course of sense perception. At the highest level one acquires the ability to radically transform the subjective significance of perceptual objects themselves, making them appear in a mode that is the very opposite of the way they are nor-mally apprehended. 1353 MA explains that when a desirable form comes into range of the eye, an agreeable state (manapa) arises; when an undesirable form appears, a disagreeable state (amanapa) arises; and when an indifferent form appears, a state that is both agreeable and disagreeable arises. It should be noted'that though these three terms are ordi-narily used to qualify the sense objects, here they also seem to signify subtle states of liking, aversion, and dull indifference that arise due to the influence of the under-lying tendencies. MT identifies \"the agreeable\" with wholesome and unwholesome states of mind associated with joy, \"the disagreeable\" with unwholesome states of mind associated with grief (displeasure), and \"the agreeable and disagreeable\" with states of mind associat-ed with equanimous feeling. 1354 MA: This equanimity is the equanimity of insight (vipas-san'upekkhii). The bhikkhu does not allow his mind to be overcome by lust, hate, or delusion, but comprehends the object and sets up insight in the neutral state. MT explains this to mean that he enters into equanimity regarding formations (sankhilr'upekkha), a particular stage Notes to Sutta 152 1359 1355 of insight knowledge (see Vsm XXI, 61-66). MT: The noble development of the faculties is the sup-pression of lust, etc., arisen through the eye, and the establishment of the eqUanimity of insight. 1356 1357 The same simile appears at MN 66.16. Po'-lthoug~ the sekha has already entered upon the way to fmal dehverance, he is still prone to subtle states of lik-1358 1359 1360 ing, aversion, and dull indifference in regard to sense objects. He experiences these, however, as impediments to his progress, and thus becomes ashamed, hUmiliated, and disgusted by them. Ariya bhavitindriya: the arahant is meant. S~ce the.arahant has eradicated all the defilements along WIth thelr underlying tendencies, in this passage the three terms -the agreeable, etc. -must be understood simply as the feelings that arise through contact with sense objects, and not as the subtle traces of liking, aver-sion, and indifference relevant to the preceding passage. The Patisambhidamagga calls this practice \"the noble supernormal power\" (ariya iddhi) and explains it thus (ii.212): To abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the r~pulsive, one pervades a repulsive being with loving-kmdness, or one attends to a repulsive object (either ani-mate or inanimate) as a mere assemblage of impersonal elements. To abide perceiving the repulsive in the unre-pulsive, one pervades a (sensually) attractive person with the idea of the foulness of the body, or one attends to an attractive object (either animate or inanimate) as imper-manent. The third and fourth methods involve the appli-cation of the first and second contemplations to both repulsive and unrepulsive objects, without discrimina-tion. The fifth method involves the avoidance of joy and sorrow in response to the six sense objects, thus enabling one to abide in equanimity, mindful and fully aware. Although this fivefold contemplation is ascribed to the arahant as a power perfectly under his control, elsewhere the Buddha teaches it to bhikkhus still in training as a way to overcome the three unwholesome roots.

Italicised numbers refer to the page numbers of the Introduction; references to sutta passages give sutta number followed by section number. The abbreviation \"ff.\" is here used to indicate that the term of entry pertaius to a continuing or repetitive sequence of sections and does not necessarily mean that the term occurs in every section of the sequence. References may be listed under an entry even when the term itself does not appear in the text, as long as the passage is pertinent to the term of entry. When a stock formulation is applied to each term in a set of categories, the reference is usually given only under the name of the set, not under the individual items belonging to that set. For example, the passage on the enlightenment factors at 2.21 is reg-istered under Enlightenment factors, but not under the names of the individual factors. Cross-references ensure that essential ref-erences are not overlooked. Pali equivalents are provided for all key doctrinal terms, though not for terms of lesser importance or for entries without an exact Pali counterpart. With few exceptions, the Pali term. is given in the singular, even though the English entry may be plural. When two Pali words with a different denotation are ren-dered by a single English word, the two are listed as separate entries - e.g., Mind is listed twice, corresponding to citta and to mana. When a single English word represents two Pali words with overlapping meanings but different contextual usage, the two sets of references are classified within the same entry sepa-rated by a slash - e.g., Compassion as a rendering for both karw:zii and anukampii. 1377"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"1378 The Majjhima Nikaya Abhidhamma, n.362, n .693, n.1047, n .1077, n .1222 Action (kamma), 45, 4.29, 86.17, n.824, 99.24£f., n.915, nn.926--28; and feeling, 136.,6; beings heirs of, 135.4ff., nn.1224-25; fourfold, 57.7ff.; great exposition of, 136.7ff.; NigCtDthas' theory of, 14.17ff., 56.3, 101.2ff.; purification of, 61.8ff.; that ends action, 57.11; three-fold, 56.4.

Therefore, they should be treated with respect-kept off the floor and places where people sit or walk-and not stepped over. They should be covered or protected for transporting and kept in a high, clean place separate from more \"mundane\" materials. Other objects should not be placed on top of Dharma books and materials. Licking the fingers to turn pages is considered bad form. If it is necessary to dispose of Dharma materials, rather than throwing them in the trash, they should be burned, mind-fully and \\Vit~ a reverential attitude.
