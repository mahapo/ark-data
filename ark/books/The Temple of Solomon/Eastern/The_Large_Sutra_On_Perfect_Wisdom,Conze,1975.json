Tucci, my translationas it first appeared in Serie Orientale Rome (1962 and 1974), thoughI have, where necessary, rearranged the sequence of the text to makeit correspond to the divisions of the Abhisamyālañkāra. In theeighth abhisamaya, at VIII 1-3 and VIII 5,2,5-21, this correspondencebreaks down altogether and I have therefore given the relevant textfrom P in pages 653-656 as an Appendix. Finally, chapter 83, Maitreya'sChapter, is missing in the Gilgit Ms, but is preserved in the Tibetan Ad(To. no. 3790), which corresponds almost literally to the Sanskrit textof P 578a-583b, which I have edited in 1968 in Melange s.d'Indianisme ala memoire de L.

Therehas, for instance, been some criticism of my superimposing the chapterheadings of Ad on the text of P, which has no such headings. Whatmotivated me was the belief that this exceptionally difficult text can bestudied much more easily if broken up into relatively short and mana-geable chapters, and I chose those of Ad because Ad alone, in its Tibetanversion, gives all the headings, whereas S and the unrevised P normallyonly number the chapters and give the headings just occasionally.8If there were even the slightest hope that each of the chief versions, i.e.S, P and Ad, might be translated in the foreseeable future, I would havestuck strictly to P. As it is, there is no such hope. What is needed atpresent is to make known the contents and message of the Large Sutrain its entirety and, aware of the execrable nature of the Nepalese Mss.on which alone the text of P can be based, I naturally relied frequentlyon the older manuscripts, which are more accurate than the often un-believably careless and corrupt late Nepalese Mss.9 This translation is acontinuation of my work on the Abhisamayālañkqra (SOR vi, 1954), andthere seems to me some value in showing how the headings of A A fitthe text of P. This correspondence is, I admit, not always easy to see,particularly where the Path of Vision is concerned, but with some patienceeverything will become clear.The most outstanding feature of contemporary Prajñāpāramitā studiesis the disproportion between the few persons willing to work in thisfield and the colossal number of documents extant in Sanskrit, Chinese,and Tibetan. Looking ahead to the year 2,000, I would say that furtherstudy would have to proceed in three stages:First, the general outlines of the argumentation of the Large Sutramust be determined, irrespective of the different versions and recensions.This is what I am trying to do in this publication, which has achievedits main purpose if it has rendered the course of the argument intelligible.In this context it must be admitted that my treatment of the lengthyrepetitions lacks somewhat in consistency, and has been chiefly guidedby the desire to cut down their bulk.Second, the literal meaning of many now obscure passages must beascertained with the help of the Ta chih tu /un,*0 which ought to betranslated in its entirety into a European language.After that is accomplished, it would be necessary and useful to scrutinize«cf.

The book opens with an account of the scene and circumstancesof the sermon.On the first page we have a condensed description of both Arhatsand Bodhisattvas. The contrast between the two goes through the argumentof the entire book. The epithets used here are explained in great detailby Nāgārjuna.1The remainder of the description of Al is designed to establish theauthority of the Sutra. A section on \"Entrusting\"* towards the end of theSutra has the same end in view. In the \"Introduction\", the preachingof perfect wisdom is credited with three excellencies:1. It is valid independent of temporal or spatial circumstances,at all times, and throughout the universe. This claim is less presump-tuous than it may sound at first sight because the assertions of thisbook are really no assertions at all and that is why they can endure.2. It proceeds from the highest level of spirituality, i.e. from theBuddha himself. The Buddha does not teach it in his human body—which could be seen in Magadha about 500 B.C.—but in his glorified\"body\". The \"glorified body\" of the Lord is either called hereāsecanaka-ātmabhāva? i.e. the body which is so beautiful that thebeholder can never be satiated with looking at it ;4 or it is call prakrty-ātmabhāva, literally the body which brings out, or corresponds to,his \"essential original nature\", here rendered as \"extraordinarybody\".5 \"The Buddha always had this body—when he was born, whenlMpp-s.

The idea is well brought out by a passagein the Pali Dīghanikāya (xviii 17=xix 16). \"When, O Lord, Brahma Sanamkumāra appears(pātu bhavati) among the Gods of the Thirty-three, he appears after having created (abhi-nimmitvā) a gross (material) body (olārikam attabhāvam). For that which is the naturalappearance {pakativanno) of Brahma, that, O Lord, is not sufficiently materialised to impresstheir vision {anabhisambhavaniyo.. .cakkhupathasmin).\"—Instead of \"extraordinary\" onemight have translated \"natural\", \"primary\", \"original\", \"real\", \"usual\". >"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2  THE LARGE SUTRA ON PERFECT WISDOMhe became a Buddha, when he turned the wheel of dharma. That iswhy beings can say to themselves, 'What I now see that is truly theBuddha's body',\" and thereby those who hesitated so far can bedelivered through their faith.6The wonderful qualities of the Buddha and his great wonder-workingpower are taken as tokens of his capacity to teach the real truth aboutthe actual facts of existence. Power and knowledge go together. Omni-science implies omnipotence and omnipresence. The descriptions wishto magnify the Buddha's stature in the eyes of the reader, and togenerate and foster an attitude of pure faith in his authority. At thesame time they counteract the notion that the Buddha is a mere man,with a man's imperfections and limitations, and they try to give anidea of his true body and personality which are immense and in-conceivable.3. The teaching has not only an intellectual and spiritual, but alsoa cosmic significance. The universe vibrates in consonance with it,and gives its consent to its message. A series of cosmic miracles precedesthe teaching of this, as of other Mahayana Sutras. We speak of a\"miracle\" when occult or spiritual forces visibly transform or overlaythe natural world in such a way as to produce wonder and awe. Thedescription of Al is a mythological way of conveying the idea thatthe spirit is victorious over matter. E. Lamotte has divided the dramaof Al into 10 scenes. The translation follows his division.A2. Secondly, there is a survey of the aims one may have in view incultivating perfect wisdom. The translation follows P, which has carriedout extensive rearrangements in the text of S, omitted many passages,and added a few. The purpose was to make this section appear as ateaching about the \"thought of enlightenment\"—first (P 18-19, 1 a-d)about the thought of enlightenment in general, and secondly (P 19-37, le)about its 22 kinds.The \"thought of enlightenment\" is (a' the decision to win full enlighten-ment, or all-knowledge-;, (b) the desire for the welfare of others.Emptinessand compassion are its two constituents.7 It makes one into a JBodhisattva.The term is used twofold8: 1. For the initial, first, production of thethought of enlightenment, the \"vow\"9. 2. For the marching towards10enlightenment. In the second sense it covers the entire career of aBodhisattva, and its 22 forms correspond to its stages (cf. Ill 10, andend in Buddhahood. The 22 kinds of P are also found in Asanga'sWag. 518-9.1śūnyatā-karunā-garbha.

Thirdly, there are various preliminary instructions, which aimthroughout at contrasting the Bodhisattva-doctrine of the great vehiclewith the teachings of the Disciples, and at correcting the views andpractices of the Disciples by infusing them with the spirit of emptiness.In the first pages (A3a), we get a brief statement about the nature ofreality, and about the attitude to be adopted towards it. Things, or\"dharmas\", are, by their nature, empty; they are really emptiness itself.We cannot \"get at\" them, but only at their names, which do not reallyrepresent them. We therefore should not \"review\" anything at all, shouldnot \"settle down\" in anything.It is noteworthv that the ontoloev of the Praiñāoāramitā is reoresentedhere, and elsewhere (cf P 39, 99, 150) as a sample continuation or exten-sion, of the traditional Buddhist doctrine of \"not-self (an-attāA It issupposed to be well known and agreed upon that the \"self, and otherexpressions which imply a \"self, such as \"being\", \"living soul\", \"person\",\"organism\", \"individual\", \"one who feels\", \"agent\", or \"thinkingsubject\", etc. are mere words, to which in ultimate realitv nothing at allçeFçesponds. What is true of the self is now said~to be true also of allother supposed entities which, in their differentiation, are data whichsomehow imply a separate self, and therefore will be unreal on the levelof accomplished self-extinction on which alone the truth becomesdiscernible.A3b. It is then said that the wisdom of a Bodhisattva is superior tothat of the Arhats, because in his compassion he puts it at the disposalof all beings, so that they may be able to win Nirvana. This superiorityis based on the \"thought of enlightenment\" (see A2), and the 6 perfections(P 41), and it finds an expression in the fact that, as the source of all thatis good in the world, the Bodhisattvas are worthy of the gifts of all beings,including the Arhats.A3c. The preliminary instructions next deal with the Yoga of perfectwisdom. The translation is not easy to follow because of the ambiguitiesof the word yoga, and of its derivatives yukta and yojayati, which areused in many shades of meaning, and have to be rendered by \"joins\",\"join up\", \"undertaking\", \"endeavour\", \"endeavouring\", \"discipline\",and so on.The argument begins with a reinterpretation of the four holy Truthsof the sermon at Benares (A-D). The connection is not immediatelyobvious at first sight, and requires prolonged study to be noticed.11 Thenfollows a discourse on the first two \"Jewels\", i.e. the Buddha (E) andthe Dharma (F).

The remaining instructions have in common that they beginwith the formula \"there are Bodhisattvas, great beings\". They deal withthe various kinds of Bodhisattvas. First of all (A3dl) they consider thedifferences which arise from the circumstances of their rebirth, and theirplace on the spiritual ladder. The decisive experience of a Buddhist takesplace when he \"wins the Path\". He then ceases to be a common man,and becomes a \"saint\", or ārya. The classification of the \"saintly, orholy persons\" (āryapudgalā) had, early on, occupied the minds of thescholastics, and this section of the Sutra may usefully be compared withthe Pali Puggalapaññatti, and with Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa.I have not discovered the principle which underlies the classificationadopted by S. P read into the text a scheme of 20 different kinds of saints,all of them \"irreversible\" according to H. But P had to make considerablerearrangements, as well as some additions and omissions. In a generalway the types seem arranged, both in S and in P, in an ascending orderof worth. The enumeration begins with the \"Streamwinner\", and endswith the last stage of a Bodhisattva's career, when he has becomea Buddha.This leads to a number of remarks on a variety of practices, or endow-ments, of a Buddha (A3dII), first of'all perfect purity (1), and all-knowledge(2, 3); and then the five eyes (4), the six superknowledges (5), and theknowledge of all modes and evenmindedness (6).Th& five eyes, or kinds of vision (A3dII4) of a Buddha are mentionedquite early on in Buddhist history. The account here agrees in generalwith the tradition of the older schools. The essential objects of each \"eye\",are, according to H :1. separate differentiated things; 2. decease andrebirth of beings12; 3. all dharmas viewed in direct intuition, withoutintervention of any discursive thought (avikalpana)1*; 4. the faculty ofattainment (adhigama) peculiar to different kinds of saints14; 5. alldharmas which are fully understood (abhisambodha) in all their aspectsand modes.ls The insistence on the nonapprehension of the five \"eyes\"is the special instruction here.The list of the six superknowledges (A3dII5) likewise belongs to thetraditional lore of the Buddhists. The first five describe psychic qualities,the sixth is peculiar to the Buddha. The special instruction consists,according to H, in that they should be seen from the standpoint of theAbsolute as \"quiescent from the outset\".1612The heavenly eye sees beings and things which are found in the six places of rebirth.13The wisdom eye knows the true character of dharmas. Nag. 439.14The dharma-eye sees by which means (upāya) and which teaching (dharma) a givenperson finds the Path. Nag. 439.15The Buddha-eye is the direct intuition of all dharmas.

The knowledge of all modes, which does not proceed byopposing one concept to another, and which is not an act of mind, and2. an evenmindedness to which all dharmas are the same, and identical.H treats A3dII6 as a part of A3dII5. In several texts the magical power\"without outflows\" is equated with evenmindedness.17A4. The preliminary instructions are concluded by an Interlude,which falls into three parts: In the second part the great Disciples givetheir assent to the instructions; they acknowledge the superiority of theperfection of wisdom of the Bodhisattvas, and the Buddha once more(cf. A3b) explains that the Bodhisattvas are the source of all the goodthere is in the world. The first and third parts deal briefly with the predic-tion of the future Buddhahood of various members of the assembly.The descriptions follow in general the stereotyped lines laid down inearly Mahayana Sutras. They have, however, some special featureswhich also appear in two passages of the Ashta,1^ which are later additions.The parallel suggests that this section of the Sutra was composed aboutthe time of the Christian era, i.e. between 50 B.C. and 50 A.D.BIt is only at this point that the central theme of the Prajñāpāramitāis reached. All the many thousand lines of this Sutra can be summedup in two sentences: 1. One should become a Bodhisattva (a Buddha-to-be), i.e. someone content with nothing less than all-knowledge attainedthrough the perfection of wisdom for the sake of all living beings. 2. Thereis no such thing as a Bodhisattva, or all-knowledge, or a \"being\", or theperfection of wisdom, or an attainment. The solution of this dilemmalies in nothing else than the fearless acceptance of both contradictoryfacts.The phases of the extinction of self, or of anything it may be based on,is the common theme of B. Bl reiterates the teaching of Al, that thedoctrine preached here proceeds from the Buddha's might, who evermay give utterance to it. At the beginning of B2 the central theme is thenstated. Thereafter, chapter 2 of S (=B2) is an expansion and restatementof the short outline of the teaching in A3a. TTie Bodhisattva, and allthat he is made of, is a mere word, inaccessible as dharma, or as factualreality. If B2 were regarded as an attempt at argumentation, it wouldbe unduly prolix. It aims, however at describing a repetitive meditationwhich is designed to bring about a certain state of mind, and not merelyto convince the intellect, but to reform the whole personality.\"Nag. 330 n. 1.18ch. 19 end, ch. 28 beginning."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6  THE LARGE SUTRA ON PERFECT WISDOMB3. Chapter 3 of S begins with some obscure and cryptic remarksabout the degrees of ripeness in insight, which are difficult to followbecause the terminology is unfamiliar, and the argument relies to someextent on a play of words. The passage is, however, important in that itsets the theme for the remainder of B.B3 contrasts, by a series of allusions, the distinctive attitude of aBodhisattva with that of a Disciple. When a Disciple practises the medita-tion on the (16) aspects, or attributes, of the four holy Truths, i.e. imper-manence, etc.,19 he uses it as an antidote to the belief in a separateindividual self. With this end in view he \"settles down\" in the convictionthat impermanence, etc., represent actual properties of actual facts(dharmas). The Bodhisattva, on the other hand, contemplates thosesame aspects as antidotes to a belief in separate dharmas. He can thereforeaccuse the Disciple of a \"craving for separate dharmas\" {dharmatrishnā),\"craving\" being the very opposite of the emancipation intended by suchcontemplations.A Bodhisattva who adopts the Disciples' methods is characterisedby \"rawness\", or \"immaturity\". The translation is here somewhatunintelligible because the argument relies on contrasting two Sanskritwords, âmah and ny-āmah. Nyāma, Pali ni-yima, means \"the way ofsalvation\", \"the certainty of winning salvation by pursuing a certain way\".Buddhist etymology derives nyāma from āma, \"raw, crude, immature\"—as nis-āma \"de-rawing, ripening\".20 \"Rawness\" is identified with thedefilements, and the condition of being an ordinary unconverted person.One distinguishes (at P 182) the distinctive Bodhisattva's \"way ofsalvation\" from that of a Disciple21 and of a Pratyekabuddha.22 Theterm nyāma denotes that stage at which each type knows for certain thatthey will, by their own distinctive methods, win the particular kind ofsalvation of which they are capable, i.e. Arhatship, Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment, full enlightenment. In the case of Bodhisattvas one canalso say that they \"enter into the fixed condition of a Bodhisattva\"(as nyāma is translated at P 66). At P 107 the entrance into the bodhisatlva-niyāma is mentioned together with the entrance into the irreversible stage.The stage of certainty is preceded by another stage of which it is acharacteristic that one can \"fall\" from it. Traditionally that stage isknown as the \"Summits'.' The scholastics of the Sarvāstivādins distin-^For the list see my Buddhist Meditation, 1956, pp. 142-146.20Tibetan: nyāma=skyon med-pa, absence of fault; niyāma=ñes-par'gyur-ba=ñxcddetermination, what is certain to come about.21 Also called samyaktva-niyāma mA'ñ 38, as Pali sammattaniyāma-avakkanti. samyaktva= Nirvana at A.K. vi 181.22SO H 903, 14 opposes bodhisattva-nyāma-avakrānti to śrāvaka-pratyekabuddhabodhi.Similarly P 21."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTERS 1-21  7guished four stages preceding entrance into the Path by the name of\"Aids to penetration\" (nirvedhabhāgīyā). They bore the names \"Heat\",\"Summits\", \"Patience\", \"Supreme mundane dharmas\". In the text herethey are referred to by the term \"wholesome roots\". The Aids to penetra-tion are parts of the preparatory path (prayogamārga) which leads upto the intuition of the truth (satya-abhisamaya) in the Streamwinner,and they have the four Truths in their 16 aspects for object. On the secondstage, the \"Summits\" (mūrdhan), one has yet little faith in the threeJewels, and from it one can \"fall\". The definition of the \"Summits\"which the Sutra here has in view is given in the Abhidharmakośa21: \"Theyare called 'Summits' because they are the highest among the unfixed(a-cala) wholesome roots, i.e. of those from which one can fall; eitherone falls back from them, or one goes beyond them into the (next stageof) Patience\". The third stage Patience (kshānti), seems alluded to inthe phrase \"adaptable craving for dharmas\"24 in the text. It impliesa contrast to \"patience conforming to dharmas\",25 which is an attitudeto be adopted relative to \"deep dharmas,\" and the descriptions givenby Nāgārjuna26 well tally with the attitude to dharmas enjoined here.The text therefore envisages here two traditions: The one distinguishesthree \"clans\" (gotra) of saints, each with a distinctive aim, programmeof practices, and stages of progress. The other distinguishes four prepara-tory stages in the career of the saints, the \"Aids to penetration\". Thetwo traditions are combined already in the Abhidharma of the Sarvās-tivādins. According to the Mahāvibhāsha21 the Disciples and Pratyeka-buddhas can, in the first two preparatory stages, still change their clan,and choose to become Buddhas. But by the time they have reached thestage of \"Patience\", they are too specialised and fixed to modify (avivartya)their approach. Once he has gone to his distinctive stage of \"Patience\",a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha can no more fall into the bad destinies,i.e. he cannot be reborn in hell, as an animal, or as a ghost. This factthen excludes him from the career of a Bodhisattva who has made avow to be sometimes reborn in the bad destinies, so as to comfort andconvert the damned, the animals and the ghosts. The Sutra here states23VI 164.24anulomiki dharma-trishnā.—In H to A xvi 322 the bodhisattva-nyāma-avakrānti isidentified with the third nirvedha-bhāgiya (esp.

So much about B3.After the Bodhisattva has spent one incalculable aeon in the \"instruc-tions\",2^ he now enters into the \"path of training\", the stage of a\"beginner\".30 The purpose of the \"Aids to penetration\" is, as we saw,to bring about a condition which makes the path of vision appear, andwhich destroys the quality of being an average, unconverted person.31Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga gives a masterly account of the medita-tions which precede entrance into the Path. As a result of these medita-tions32 indifference or repulsion (pātikulyatā) to complexes (sankhārā),or conditioned events, is established. One wants to be released from them,grasps them in contemplation, sees nothing in them one could seizeupon as I or mine, puts away fear or delight, and becomes indifferent(udāslno) and impartial (majjhato) to all \"complexes\", as not reallyconcerning one at all. One turns away from them and views the tranquilPath, Nirvana as calm. All signs which indicate anything conditionedstand out as mere impediments, or obstacles (palibodha).^ One makesNirvana into the object, which is signless, procedureless, without com-plexes, the stopping of complexes, by means of a cognition \"which passesbeyond the kinship and plane of average men, which enters into thekinship and plane of the Ariyas\". It is the first turning to, the first layingto heart, the first bringing to mind of Nirvana as object.34We do not, I think, possess a description of the meditetional practicesassociated with the \"Aids to penetration\" among either Sarvāstivādinsor Mādhyamikas. We are much better informed about the interpretationof the Yogācāra School.35 As interpreted by the Yogācārins, the Aidsto penetration aim at first to remove the belief in separate outer objects,and the inclination towards them, and thereafter to bring about a concen-tration in which \"the light of the gnosis appears as without the distractionscaused by the separate representation of a perceiving subject\".*6 Althoughin their details the Yogācāra accounts of the Aids to penetration areheavily coloured by theories which are specific to that school, in a generalway the removal of both object and subject can be regarded as the redthread which goes through the argumentation of B4 to BIO.It must still be mentioned that the Aids to penetration arise through29so H 36.*°prayoga-mārga=adhimukti-caryā-bhūmi H 64. ādikarmika. cf. at P 154.*A.K.

As a matter of fact, the two last Aids to penetration canbe accomplished only in the fourth trance (dhyāna), which is the necessaryprerequisite (āśraya) for entry into the path of vision.38 The Sutra men-tions two concentrations, one at P 133 and one at P 142, which occuraccording to H on the \"Summits\" and \"Supreme dharmas\" respectively.The two insights are called \"concentrations\", because of the peacefulcalm which accompanies them.39B4 to 10 gives an ontological analysis of a Bodhisattva on the decisivestages of his career. These stages are not thought to be achieved here,but are described as they are conceived in the course of the meditationspreceding the path of vision. The argument refers to the following tenevents in a Bodhisattva's career: 1. He gains the thought of enlightenment,P 121-122; 2. becomes irreversible P 107,117-120,123,128; wins 3. perfectwisdom P 123, 136; and 4. the prediction, P 144; 5. he \"goes forth\" tothe knowledge of all modes, P 138, 141; 7. obtains perfect purity, P 138(cf. A3dIIl); 8. gains apparitional rebirth, P 138 (corresponds to the9th bhūmi in P 224); 9. is able to know full enlightenment, P 141; and10. reaches the knowledge of all modes, P 151-154.Alternatively chapters 3 to 6 of S may survey four aspects of a Bodhi-sattva's spiritual life:—I. The thought of enlightenment, which initiates, accompanies,and concludes it (B4).II. The perfect wisdom which inspires him, viewed as an object(B5, 6, 6a).HI. His relation to all-knowledge and enlightenment (B7b-8).IV. That all the constituents of his spiritual life are due to ignoranceand are illusory (B9, 10).I have had great difficulty in unravelling the sequence of the argument,and am not sure that I have always succeeded in doing so.I. (B4) The idea that the thought of the Absolute, being an absolutethought, is \"transparent luminosity\" (pra-bhāsvara)40 repeats an oldtradition, that \"thought in its substance is luminous through and through,but has become defiled by adventitious taints\".41 Such a self-luminousand pure thought is at the heart of all reality. It is the original realitywhich we have covered up with all sorts of coverings.

Its logical implications areignored, but the descriptions of the ways of getting to it occupy the restof the Sutra. At this point the Sutra is content to state that in his attitudeto this thought, as to all data of experience, the Bodhisattva should not\"fancy himself. The connotations of the Sanskrit phrase na manyatecannot be reproduced by one single English word. Man-yate is connectedon the one side with man-as \"mind\", and on the other with māna,\"conceit\". In the first sense it can be translated as \"to think of or about\",\"to consider\", \"to mind (about)\", \"to put one's mind to\", \"to havein mind\", \"to have in view\", \"to set one's heart on\", \"to fix the thoughtson\", \"to wish, or strive\", \"to care about\". In the second sense it means\"to be conceited about\", \"to fancy oneself for\".42 Conceit is due to afalse sense of ownership and an insufficient extinction of self. It is discussedmore amply in the later parts of the Sutra.43Ha. (B5) The Bodhisattva next considers that from the point of viewof ultimate reality all things neither appear nor disappear, and that inconsequence they can be neither affirmed nor denied. Furthermore(at I3g), seen from the Absolute all dharmas are unutterable, and verbalfictions are all that we ever operate with.lib. (B6a) Because of the emptiness of all entities one should \"notstand\" in, or on, them, i.e. one should not insist on their reality. \"Notto take one's stand\" is equated with \"not settling down in the fixedconviction\" that this is so or so, or with not having a fixed inclinationto do, to win or to lose something.44 The best way of avoiding the faultof \"standing\" on dharmas is not to bring them in at all,45 and to refrainfrom any act of discrimination which may turn to them.46 The oftenrepeated saying that the Bodhisattva should \"stand in perfect wisdom bynot taking his stand anywhere\" is explained by Asañga47 as the avoidanceof five standpoints:1. He does not take his stand on a belief in a self (see P 132), and thusdoes not say \"I know\", \"this is my wisdom\".2. He does not take his stand on the conceptions of Bodhisattvaswho have not seen the true reality, and thus he does not try to definewisdom in any way.42Also Pali maññati, to be proud of, to be conceited, to boast.—manyanā=Pali maññanā,at A xxi 387, 389, and xxix 480.—H to A xi 235 explains by utkarsha.

In the Ashta5Q the Lord is quoted asidentifying \"formative influence\"51 with \"discrimination\",52 and thelater Pali tradition counts \"formative influence\" among the Maras.53As a secondary meaning of the term we may mention \"accumulationof karma\".54 In its etymological meaning the term means \"to bringtogether\", \"perform\", \"prepare\", \"render effective\".

It is erroneous because the world asperceived is largely a fabrication of our desire for adaptation to it, andcovers up the vision of what is really there, i.e. Nirvana, or the successionof ceaselessly changing momentary dharmas.

A number ofhis conversations with the Buddha are recorded. They are scatteredthrough the Pali Canon, but combined into one section in the Samyuktā-gama of the Sarvāstivādins. The text refers here to a Sutra58 which,according to Nāgārjuna,59 discussed \"Śrenika the Believer\" and at thesame time, according to the Vibhāsha^0 and Nāgārjuna, preached theemptiness of all dharmas. Since Subhuti's argument is difficult, andsince we are inclined to lean on signs, and do not see how we can havefaith without a sign, \"Subhuti here takes as his witness the Little Vehiclewhere it speaks of the emptiness of dharmas, How could those whopractise the great vehicle not believe in it?\"Śrenika showed \"faith\", first, in that he believed that the Buddhacould help him to find the path,61 and, second, in that he was willingto accept the Tathagata in spite of the fact that he could not be relatedto any of the skandhas, i.e. to form, etc. He entered into a \"cognitionwith a limited scope\" which, according to Haribhadra means that itwas directed to the absence of a self in persons,62 (and not also in dharmas).Śrenika was concerned to find a true self, in other words, the Tathagata.Nāgārjuna relates that Śrenika originally took the person as one lump,and that therefore the Buddha asked him about its elements. He hadalso heard people speak of the \"I\" in two ways, as identical with the fiveskandhas, and as different from them. The skandhas are multiple, andthe I is one—so they cannot be identical. The self would be born andperish as the skandhas do, and it would not be independent of causesand conditions—thus it would not be the true self. Therefore, how cansomething outside the five skandhas have the character of \"I\" or \"self ?As Nāgārjuna puts it, \"Śrenika's second act of faith consisted in that,when he had heard that the Buddha denied the self, and said that fromthe beginning there was none, he accepted the fact that, because thereis no self, the dharmas have no support, and are like a dream, a mirage,nonapprehensible.

The Samyukta-āgama has some variations.There it is stated expressly that the initial question assumes that the trueself is identical with the reality which survives death, and that threeanswers are possible: 1. The self is eternal, 2. the self is cut off, 3. (theself is) the Tathagata.lid. (B6c) Perfect wisdom is obviously not a \"something\". It is neitherfound nor got at, and one should accept this fact without losing heart.He. (B6a) Nor is perfect wisdom a property. When one says that aBodhisattva has perfect wisdom, \"is not lacking in it\", one seems toattribute to him a property. Such attribution of properties is quite in-compatible with the emptiness of all dharmas.III. then considers the statements one may make about a Bodhi-sattva's relations to the knowledge of all modes, or to enlightenment.In each case, such statements must be seen in the light of emptiness,and they really assert or posit nothing at all.B7b. The Bodhisattva \"goes forth\" to all-knowledge. That statementmust take account of the fact that no dharma is ever \"born\"—originatedinto birth-and-death, or \"goes forth\", escapes from it—since it has noown-being and no nature of its own.B7c. Skill in means is a well-known condition of winning full enlighten-ment. It is now defined as the absence of all the false attitudes describedin B5-7a.B7d. The knowledge of all modes is directed to dharmas. Since thosedharmas do not in themselves exist, it is without an object, it is a non-dual cognition, i.e. one which differs substantially from the cognitionswith which we are familiar.B8. It is stated that the Buddhas deliver their prophecy of futureenlightenment to a Yogin who practises true meditation and whosepersonality possesses such a constitution, made of form, etc. that theBuddhas can base a prophecy on it. This statement is not, however,really true, because it implies false discriminations.IV. The analysis is fitly summed up by the conclusion that separateentities do not exist, and are all ignorance (B9) and illusion (BIO). B9 canbe regarded as the removal of the false discrimination of an object, andBIO (from 1 3u) that of a subject.B9a. First of all, the non-existence of separate dharmas, which resultsfrom the foregoing analysis, is connected with ignorance.

The belief in the existenceof dharmas which really do not exist is ignorance. Ignorance is the firstlink of conditioned coproduction. The doctrine of conditioned coproduc-tion is restated in what follows. The argument is perhaps made moreintelligible by a parallel passage in Candrakīrti's Prasannapadā64:\"Because of the apprehension of a self, and of what belongs to a self,beings do not overcome birth-and-death. And why? It is because onereviews self and other, that action-forming forces (karma-abhisamskārā)come about. The foolish untaught common people who do not knowthat all dharmas are absolutely, completely nirvanised get at 'self andother. Having got at that, they settle down in it. They then becomegreedy, full of hatred and confused. Thereupon they bring about thethreefold action—by body, speech, and mind. Discriminating, by superim-position,65 what does not exist, they say 'I am greedy, full of hatred,confused'.\"B9b then infers from this analysis of conditioned coproduction theattitude to be adopted to perfect wisdom, enlightenment.B9c is absent in S. It is an addition made by P, to bring home the factthat neither must one assume the reality of the objective elements, normust one believe in the subject as an ultimately real agent that experiences.BIO considers, finally, the mode of existence of the person who goesto enlightenment and finds that it is nothing but an illusion.Bll, 12. The negative attitude to all the separate data of experience,which has been expounded in B4-10, would have a most demoralisingeffect on spiritual life if it were not counterbalanced by a positive attitudeto other people. While he is still in the initial stages of his training, on thelevel of a beginner,66 the Bodhisattva needs some social support, some\"sustenance\" (samparigraha H). In order to stand the Void he must befirmly anchored in society. Those who are engaged in completely isolatingthemselves from everything, and in purifying themselves of it, are in needof association with spiritual friends (B12) to keep up their morale. Ifthe house is well garnished and cleaned, one must beware lest worsedevils enter into it. According to a Tibetan commentary,67 the twosupports mentioned in Bll and 12 are 1. internal, i.e. the cognitionwhich enables one to reject the two extremes of phenomenal existenceand of the Hinayanistic Nirvana; 2. external, i.e. the spiritual preceptorand teacher.Bll.

Buddhist texts frequently emphasise the necessity of a goodspiritualfriend (kalyāna-mitra). It is mentioned in other parts of the Sutra aswell,69 and Śāntideva has collected an instructive number of passagesfrom a variety of texts.70 The \"true friend\" is one who helps us to win abetter destiny, or the ultimate goal of Buddhahood. The term does notrefer so much to good companions as to one's teacher, the spiritualadviser from whom one learns the Dharma, and whom one should revere.He is important as a protector against the forces of evil, personified inMara—who twist the teaching. In other parts of the Sutra71 the \"deedsof Mara\" are enumerated in greater detail than here.C. A new topic is now taken up in chapters 7 to 11 of S: What is aBodhisattva? (CI) What is a great being? (CII) What is the great vehicle?(CHI).CI. As to the first, the exact question is: bodhisattva kahpada-arthah?literally, \"Bodhisattva\", \"what is the pada-artha?\" \"Pada-artha\" eithermeans, 1. \"meaning (artha) of a word\" (padd), or, 2. that which corres-ponds to the meaning of a word, i.e. a \"thing\". The answer is: \"a-pada-arthah bodhisattva-pada-artha\", literally \"nothing is the meaning of theword 'Bodhisattva'\". One may also translate: \"'Bodhisattva', whatentity is that?—The entity 'Bodhisattva' is a nonentity\".The remainder of the chapter is based on a play of words, betweenpada-artha and padam, as noted in the translation. It elaborates a famousverse in the Dhammapada,12 which I quote here according to the Sanskritversion of the Udānavarga.7*\"Of those who have no hoard, who have well comprehended food.74Whose range is the Void, is the Signless, is Detachment75—As the track of birds in the sky (space), so is their track76 hard to follow.**A xxvii, 448=5 ch. 49.69A xv, 292 = 5 ch. 37; A xxii, 396=5 ch. 45.10Śikshāsamuccaya pp. 34-44.TiA xii = 5ch. 31-32; A xxi = 5ch. 45.72vv. 92-93.73XXIX, 23-24 in Rockhill; no. 35-42 in Stzb.

As to the\"wholesome\", the \"worldly\" are found in ordinary people, while the\"supramundane\" are included in the right path of the Saints. Sinceworldly dharmas are \"with outflows\", not an antidote to the seizingon self, they should be shunned, just as the \"supramundane\" should,for the opposite reason, be accepted. The \"supramundane\" are, whencontemplated, either \"conditioned\" or \"unconditioned\". \"Conditioned\"elements relate to the empirical conventional world, are included in thetriple universe, and depend on causes and conditions. Haribhadra ins-tances the 37 wings of enlightenment. The \"unconditioned\" elementsrelate to ultimate reality, are not included in the triple universe, and donot depend on conditions. Suchness is an example. When developed,supramundane dharmas are either \"common\" or \"uncommon\".

Four definitions are given,by the Buddha himself, by Śāriputra, by Subhuti, and by Pūrna (CII, 4),CII, 1-3 expound the aim, goal or programme (samuddeśa) of Maha-yanistic activity. Haribhadra79 says that CII, 1-3 correspond to the threestages of the conquest of a country by a king: he annihilates all hostileforces; takes possession of the ground thus gained; attains a predominantposition with regard to other kings.CII,1. The Buddha, the great Compassionate One, sees the greatnessof the Bodhisattva in his comprehensive service to others.CII,2. Śāriputra, chief protagonist of Abhidharma-wisdom, charac-teristically stresses the negative aspects of his greatness, the forsakingof all false views.CII,3. Subhuti sees the greatness of the Bodhisattva in his final positiveachievement (adhigama), i.e. the thought of enlightenment and of all-knowledge. In his explanation of the Bodhisattva's nonattachment tothis thought, Subhuti, in the account given by the Ashta,^ repeats whathe had said before (at B4) about the \"thought of enlightenment\", and itis there, and not in CII,3, either in S or in P, that he makes one of theremarks about which Śāriputra questions him (see ch. 12 n. 3).CII,4. Pūrna, son of Maitrāyanī, was \"the foremost in explaining thedoctrine\".81 With his answer a new argument begins—a description ofthe various stages of progress (pratipatti, H) of the Bodhisattva.According to Haribhadra, the argument from CII,4 to the end of Dis occupied with the four kinds, or stages, of \"progress\". These corres-pond, according to Asañga,82 as follows, to the stages of a Bodhisattva'scareer. The \"putting on of the armour\" (CII,4), which signifies vigour,and the \"setting out\"83 (CH,5-6) correspond to the initial stages of\"equipment with merit\" and of \"action in resolute faith\", the \"progressin equipment\",84 up to CIII,le, to the upper part of the \"path of training\",the first stages of CHI,If to the \"path of vision\", the remaining stagesof CIII,If to the \"path of development\", CIII,2 to both paths, and the\"progress in going forth\" (CHI,3 and D) has the last three stages of the\"path of development\" for basis (adhishthāna).19P. 83.801 19-20.MA.N.

The first step in the progress is \"to put on the great armour\".The Bodhisattva is a hero, a warrior, and an \"armour\" seems appropriateto him. The armour consists in the six perfections, which are againdescribed, first in general, with special stress on the altruism of a Bodhi-sattva, and then one by one in great detail. Thirty-six varieties are surveyed,6 groups of 6—each perfection being combined with all the others.CII,5,6. After that we hear what occurs when the Bodhisattva, next,sets owf85 in the great vehicle (CII,5), and, after that when he mountson86 it (CII,6). To \"set out\" means to get started. If \"mounting on\"is a later step, the translation is faulty, and one should render the termby \"ascend on\". This is suggested by Haribhadra,87 according to whomthe Bodhisattva first \"sets out\" in the vehicle which represents the factorsand results of the path,88 and then \"ascends on\" it, or \"by means of it\",inasmuch as he comes to higher and still higher degrees of perfection.89CII,7. After Pūrna had (at CII,4-6) explained the practical task of aBodhisattva in its three initial stages, Subhuti and the Buddha considerthe actual reality which can be attributed to these practical endeavours.They and their objects have only the reality value of a magical illusion,of a magical show, owing to the illusory nature of the \"beings\" involved.The ontological analysis now proceeds in three steps:1. In actual reality, the Bodhisattva is not armed with the greatarmour, because \"to be armed with the great armour\" is an attribute,a mark, which may be said to be his own, and the emptiness of all\"marks\" means that their negation can be attributed to a thing, or aperson, with the same justification as their affirmation.2. One makes practical efforts to bring something about, to \"make\"something. But there is no maker of anything, nor any power to make,or to put together. This is, in the final analysis, due to their \"beyond-end-ness\".3. The practical efforts aim at emancipation, or deliverance. Assuch they are without a real basis, because one cannot claim thatanything, as it exists, is either bound or freed. Candrakīrti90 defines\"bondage\" as the defilements, like greed, etc., since they deprive oftheir autonomy91 the beings who are bound by them. Because a commonman is in their bondage, he cannot rise above the triple world. Freedom85Its mark (H 86) is to be samyak-vyavasthita, its essence is the attainment of a correctposition, and the process of mastering all the properties of a Mahayanistic saint (samasta-mahāyâna-dharmākramana-svabhāva).i6samārūdho.87// 85.8 ^hetu-phala-ātmaka-dharma.Wuttarottara-viśeska-adhigamān.MPrasannapadā 290.^a-sva-tantrī-karane."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTERS 1-21  19consists in cutting through the bonds of the passions. These passionsare essentially ignorance, which again is the result of making distinc-tions, e.g. between \"to be\" and \"not to be\", or between \"Nirvana\"and \"birth-and-death\", \"emancipation\" and \"bondage\", and so on.92CIII. Next, the argument proceeds to the meaning of the great vehicle.The Sutra begins here with five questions asked by Subhūti, as in AI23.The questions are then answered, one by one: the first in CIII, 1 a-e,the second in CIII,If, and the third to fifth in CIII,2. It must be bornein mind that the Large Prajñāpāramitā is an expansion of the Ashta,and that CIII,l,a-f are represented there by only three short sentences.In one of the more systematic parts of the Sutra, the great vehicle isnow defined through its constituents (CIII,1).CIII,la. First, of course, the six perfections, which are briefly defined,with special emphasis on the \"skill in means\", or the help which we oweto others.CIHjlb. Considering the paramount importance of the idea of empti-ness, a list of 20 kinds of emptiness is particularly welcome. The term\"emptiness\" as such is said to mean \"neither unmoved nor destroyed\".\"Unmoved\" (a-kūtastha) means that it overtowers (kūta) all change, isunchangeable in what it is, in its own being, \"steadfast as a mountainpeak, as a pillar firmly fixed\".93 The opposite would be the change, ordestruction, of its own being. Both of these are excluded.Now, from its beginnings, Buddhism has been taught as the \"middleway\" between the two heresies of Eternalism and Annihilationism.It is now maintained that to say \"a thing is\" is equivalent to \"it is eternallywhat it is\", \"it remains for ever what it is\", and that the formula \"it isdestroyed\" is equivalent to saying that \"it is not\". The whole doctrineof emptiness, as taught here, rests on this equivalence.\"Emptiness\" is a word for the identity, or nondifference, of \"yes\"and \"no\". It is an antidote to all grasping at false discriminations andconceptions (vikalpa), and it is another term for \"nonduality\". \"Yes\"and \"no\" are not reflections of actual fact, but of the attitudes of self-willed individuals.The general notion of emptiness is then applied to 20 different conceptsor categories. Lists of emptinesses were very popular in the Mahayaha,and also the Theravādins had one. Outside the Prajñāpāramitā traditionwe have a list of 24 in Patisambhidā magga (Pts.) II, 177-184, and of 7in the Lankāvatārasūtra (p. 74). The formulations of the Pts provide aninstructive contrast to this section of the Sutra. \"Empty\" is taken thereto mean \"empty of self, or of anything that would constitute a self—i.e.of permanence, stability, everlastingness, nonliability to reversal\".

Empty of self;942. Moving in the direction of Nirvana;953.

Sometimes, how-ever, we meet with lists of 7 and 14.98 A few of these forms occur inde-pendently in other parts of the text.99We possess a number of explanations of the items, which however,vary widely among themselves. The earliest is that of Nāgārjuna (c. A.D.150?), as yet untranslated.100 The Yogācāra authors, whose writingshave come to us, seem to have largely ignored the original intention ofthe text. We possess a commentary in the Sandhinirmocana-sūtra (c.150),101 in Sthiramati's Madhyāntavibhāgatikā,102 c. 450, and in Diñnāga'sPindârtha,10* c. 450. The deviation of these authors from the originalmeaning is due to their desire to find \"the real esoteric meaning\" of theSutras.104 The hints of Haribhadra,105 c. 800, are of great help, althoughhe often seems to do violence to the text by coordinating the 20 formsof emptiness with the ten stages (bhūmi) of a Bodhisattva and with theten kinds of ignorance, which, according to the Yogācāras,106 are re-moved on the ten stages.

These concentrations, really innumerable, are said to bevarieties of the 3 doors to freedom,110 and they belong to the plane ofthe 4th trance.111 Lists of such concentrations seem to have been popularin the first centuries of the Christian era.

The letters which comprise the Arapacana have remainedsubstantially the same during that period. But there are great variationsin the choice of the words used to illustrate them. In one case Nāgārjuna'scommentary indicates that a word had its origin in Southern India.120The text of the Nepalese manuscripts of the Sanskrit text, which datefrom c. 1800, is, through the ignorance and carelessness of the scribes,often unsatisfactory.

Four fixedpoints stood out in that career: 1. The prediction by Dīpañkara; 2. thestage of becoming irreversible; 3. the sojourn in the Tushita heavens,and, of course, 4. the attainment of Buddhahood. When the career ofthis Bodhisattva was held to be the prototype not only of that of all theBodhisattvas, but even of everyone who followed the doctrine of theMahayana, it became natural that one should wish to alter the traditionabout the stages of the Path, which had been elaborated on the assumptionthat Arhatship was the goal. The old scheme was not entirely abandoned,but in some way integrated with the six perfections.It is likely that originally seven stages only were assumed, and thatthe number was raised to ten when the decimal system became popular.125Since Buddhahood is the goal of a Bodhisattva, the very last stage (10)was obviously that of a Buddha, or Tathāgata. The one before (9) wouldbe that of a Bodhisattva's last birth. Prediction and irreversibility—bothlinked together—would then go into the 7th and (or) 8th stage. Thefirst stage would be that of the \"thought of enlightenment\", with whichthe career of a Bodhisattva properly begins. Another fixed point wouldbe the stage on which the perfection of wisdom in its specific doctrinesis fully understood. In this Sutra it is the seventh.127 The correspon-dence of stages 2 to 6 with the first five perfections does not appear to meto be clearly marked here, but perhaps it was intended.The Mahāsamghikas worked out a primitive, and rather unsystematic,scheme in the Mahāvastu.12* Later the Daśabhūmika, c. A.D. 100, theBodhisattvabhūmi, c. 400, and the Madhyamakāvatāra, c. 650, workedout a neater arrangement, which has become classical in Mahayanatradition. Our Sutra stands halfway between the earlier and the finalarrangement, and, according to Rahder, it seems to correspond closelyto a treatise on the \"stages\" which is preserved only in the Chinese trans-lation of Fo Nien (383-417).12*The text gives, first of all, a simple enumeration of the items. It thenrepeats them, and adds an explanation to each. The second list oftendiffers verbally from the first, but there are few material discrepancies.In other schemes names are attached to the stages. There are none here.CIII,3. Next, we hear why the \"great vehicle\" is so called. In this part,the Sutra first simply repeats the answer, or rather the five answers,as found in the Ashta (I, 24), and then considers each one of them indetail.Haribhadra sees here a discussion of \"going forth\", which was fore-12SHar Dayal, The Bodhisattva doctrine, 1932, p. 271.127In Bodhisattva-bhūmi and Daśabhūmika it is, however the 6th.1281,76 sq.1297- 309."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"24  THE LARGE SUTRA ON PERFECT WISDOMshadowed in CIII,2, and which continues until the end of D. \"Goingforth\" (nir-yāna) may mean also \"marching out of\", or \"issuing from\",and there is, of course, in the Sanskrit the connection with \"vehicle\"iyāna). \"Progress in going forth\" (see at CH,4) brings about, in the end,the attainment of the omniscience of a Buddha.DD. We reach now the climax of the argument, i.e. the dialectics ofattainment. First of all we are assured (Dl) that the Bodhisattva reacheshis goal, and attains to all-knowledge. I do not understand, however,what contribution the remarks on \"expounding the great vehicle inagreement with the perfection of wisdom\"—with which chapter 12 ofS begins—make to the progress of the argument.D2. The impossibility of any kind of attainment is then demonstratedin 3 steps. D2a and D2b employ the same literary device as C did. First,Subhūti gives his answers in brief, and then they are amplified bit by bit.It is rather confusing that one of the remarks here attributed to Subhūti(P 250, ch. 20 n. 6) has in fact been made by Śakra in another, later, partof the Sutra.^oD2a and 2b both begin with the same statement about what a Bodhi-sattva should do, i.e. not \"approach\" (upaiti=upa-eti), not \"go to\",not \"move in the direction of form, and of the other elements whichconstitute a Bodhisattva as he is when he has attained. The word\"approach\" seems synonymous with \"get at\",131 and even with\"obtain\".132 According to Haribhadra133 one must insert at P 244 after\"approach\" (cf. ch. 20n. 1): \"a Bodhisattva as something that should beattained, and that in its own-being consists of form, etc. Because thatBodhisattva, who should be attained, does not exist\".134 He does notapproach the condition of a being who is perfectly identified with en-lightenment. The remainder of both D2a and 2b is occupied with theontological reasons for this practical attitude.D2a. First of all, nothing is really ever brought forth. The translationhere makes clumsy reading, because the words abhi-nir-vritti, abhi-nir-vritta (abhinibbatta in Pali) can, as far as I can see, not be rendered by. Aii47=/>f.219.131cf.

I have translated \"is not really a created thing\".\"Reproduced\", or \"re-existence\", or \"is really there\" would also havebeen possible. The idea is akin to \"produced\", \"born\", and its negation(an-abhinirvritti) is explained by Haribhadra as \"unborn\",135 or as\"without own-being\".136 It has the traditional connotation of \"producedin dependence on craving\".D2b. The argument here assumes that what has never been broughtforth, is \"nonproduction\", or \"the unproduced\". The dialectics of thatconcept is now investigated, and leads to the nonduality of all the featuresof existence. An attainment obviously requires not only one, but quitea number of dualisms.D2c. Thirdly,137 nonproduction is brought into direct relation withattainment. The sequence of the argument seems to be fairly clear :1. Śāriputra points out that, if everything is \"unproduced\" andif \"nonproduction\" is equivalent to attainment, then everybody hasalready attained, without any effort, everything that can be attained.So what is the use of any spiritual striving? One must here bear in mindthat the \"cognition of nonproduction\" is traditionally one of thechief attributes of an Arhat. Originally it meant that an Arhat perceivesthat unwholesome states will no more be produced in him. In theMahayana the term acquires an ontological meaning.2. Subhuti, in reply, points out that(a) one should not \"wish\" for any spiritual results, and(b) that a sense of effort would not help the actual work of a Bodhi-sattva.As to (a) one must remember that in Buddhist Sanskrit \"to wish\"(icchati), also \"to desire\", \"to expect\", is confused with eshati, \"tostrive\", \"to seek for\", \"to search\".138 The connection between (a)and (b) is therefore clearer in Sanskrit than it is in English. The ideaitself is similarly expressed in the Tathāgataguhyal2>9: \"There is noproduction of a Buddha for those who wish for (icchanti) the productionor stopping of any dharma. Nor do those rise above birth-and-deathwho search for {paryeshanti, desire) a realistic (bhāvatah) Nirvana\".3. One then discusses the degree of fact there can be in the relationof the production of an attainment to the \"unproduced\".4. The argument ends with an indication that all this does nottouch ultimate reality and ultimate truth, but is mere conventionaltalk.135p. 617.H6nih-sva-bhâvah, to A ix, 206.^properly begins at P257 = S fol. 100a.138Tosome extent the term was apparently confused even with ricchati=appeti, arpayatito procure.wPrasannapadā 540-541."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"26  THE LARGE SUTRA ON PERFECT WISDOMD3. The Sutra concludes with a description of the practical attitudewhich alone can solve the logical difficulties advanced. We should notlean on anything.This is first explained from an ontological angle (D3a), i.e. it is saidof dharmas that they do not lean on anything. The nonleaningness issaid to be in the nature of things. The term \"not-leaning\" (a-niśrita)can be applied to dharmas (1) either in their relation to our practicaldemands on them, or (2) in their relation with each other, or (3) it canbe applied to persons in their relation to dharmas.140In the first sense, it refers to the \"unreliability\" of dharmas whichgive our practical activity nothing to lean upon. As Haribhadra explains,\"dharmas, because of the lack of either single or manifold own-being,are unworthy of reliance.\"141The second meaning is that of \"independence\" in connection withthe analysis of causation. It occurs in such passages as: \"That conscious-ness-element does not lean142 on the eye-organ, nor has it come fromthe stimuli, nor does it stand in the middle between them—not within,not without, not between both\".143 Or in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa144:\"What foundation145 is there for an imagination of what is unreal (abhūta-parikalpd)T—\"The foundation is a perverted (viparyastā) perception\"—\"What is the foundation of that?\"—\"The fact that it has no support(a-pratishthānam)\"—\"What is the foundation of that?\"—\"This standingwithout support, of that there is no foundation at all. For all dharmasare supported (pratistishthita) on standing without support as theirfoundation.\"In the third meaning, persons, i.e. the Saints and Buddhas, are peoplewho do not lean on anything. Haribhadra146 explains \"not leaning\"as \"not inclined towards\", \"not settled down in\" (an-abhinivishta). Thismeaning of the term prevails in the Pali Scriptures,147 where it is connectedwith the loss of lust and hate,148 with absence of clinging, grasping and140Sometimes all three meanings are intended, as in Dharmasangiti (Śi 285, 11): \"Theteacher of emptiness is not captivated (samhriyate) by worldly dharmas, because of non-leaningness (a-niśritatvād).\"141H 123 : a-niśraya-arhatvād. niśraya=home, to reside in, to dwell in.āśrayati=to takerefuge in.—Also A xxx, 490: sarva-dharmeshv aniśrita-samjñā, where H comments: māyo-pama-samjñā.u2niśrito, is (not) dependent on.mpitriputrasamāgama, Si 250, 7.144&, 264, 4.

The term is analogous to Nirvana,and is closely connected with nir-yāna, \"going forth\",157 a synonymof the Path, which is discussed in this part of the Sutra. At the same timethe word \"Nihśarana \" is loaded with associations with śaranam, \"refuge\",which again implies a seeking for support,158 a place which one can fleeto, on which one can rely, or in which one can find a refuge.

The practical side of this \"nonleaning\" is then explained in moredetail in relation to the practice of the six perfections.161 The translationfollows P, which gives only the first and last perfections in detail. S, onthe other hand, treats also the other four perfections in detail, but omitshere the detailed account of the perfection of wisdom, which occurselsewhere. It will be noticed that at this point the Sutra develops morefully the theme which began the discussion at P 17.D3c. Finally,162 the achievement of perfect wisdom, and the dwellingin it. In P and in S, D3b begins and ends with a reference to the \"pathof enlightenment\" (bodhi-mārga), which somewhat obscures the courseof the argument. In A I 31, where the whole of D3b is missing, the connec-tion of D3c with D3a is clearer and more explicit. It is there effectedby the sentence: \"Śāriputra: Which is, in the Bodhisattvas, this perfectionof the nonleaning on all dharmas?\" to which Subhūti replies: \"Just thisperfection of wisdom\", etc. as D3c.The reward of accepting these teachings is that the Bodhisattva \"dwellsin the dwelling of the perfection of wisdom\". It is one of the paradoxesof the Prajñāpāramitā literature that the relation of \"support\" which wasrejected for the unconverted man in relation to his environment, is nowused to describe the relation of the wise to wisdom. The wise \"rely on\"wisdom, are supported by it.163 Although they are \"unsupported\",although they do not \"dwell on\" anything, do not \"stand\" anywhere,have no \"home\" anywhere, yet they \"dwell\" in perfect wisdom as their\"dwelling\". The phrase, \"he dwells in the dwelling of the perfection ofwisdom\", occurs frequently in this Sutra, and we have met it before.164Haribhadra explains it to mean \"the acquisition of wieldiness of thoughtin the four postures\".165 Wieldiness (Pali: kammaññattā) can also be16Ocf.

To \"dwell\" is a technicalterm which is regularly connected with the \"four postures\",167 and itseems to indicate a condition, attitude, or state of mind, which is keptup in whatever position the body may find itself. One can therefore renderthe idea of \"dwelling in the dwelling of perfect wisdom\" by saying that\"he adjusts himself, his whole personality, to perfect wisdom.\"In addition, he will \"never cease from taking it to heart\". Literally,the text says, \"he is not lacking in this attention\". This attribute is oftencoupled with the first, because of the assonance of the sounds involved,i.e. viharaty.. .vihārena, avirahitaś ca.. .manasikārena. \"Attention\"can also mean \"mental activity\", \"mind-work\", \"action in the mind\"(manasikāra). Although a special mental function—the fixation of themind on an object—it is nevertheless coextensive with all mental activity,and inseparable from it. An act of consciousness requires three conditions:an inward sense organ, an outward sense-object, and an act of attention.168The difference between wholesome and unwholesome actions is due tothe difference in the quality of the attention, which is either unwise(ayoniso),169 or wise (yoniso). The first, in conflict with the truth,170 turnsto \"signs\"; the second is directed to Nirvana.171 The Sutra now considersthe problem of the mutual relation of these two kinds of attention:The difficulty which Śāriputra raises in this respect is expressed moreclearly in the Ashta. It is this: \"Attention\" is defined as a \"turning-towards of a mind-in-action and it makes thought support itself in theobject\".172 Attention and perfect wisdom are therefore incompatible and™<>A.N.I 257. cf.

He also possesses two kinds of \"patience\",—he is patienttowards all beings, and he patiently accepts the Prajñāpāramita teaching about the truenature of all dharmas—The Tibetan seems, however, to interpret as \"he acquires thepatient acceptance of the sameness of all dharmas\"."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38   AA -   P 5-6(21) with their flashes of ideas uninterrupted; (22) endowed with self-confidence when engaged in overpowering endless assemblies; (23) skilledin going forth during endless kotis of aeons; (24) resolutely intent ondharmas which they held to be like an illusion, a mirage, a reflection ofthe moon in water, a dream, an echo, an apparition, an image in themirror, a magical creation; (P5) (25) skilful in understanding the destinyof beings, their subtle thoughts, their conduct and intentions;2 (26) withunobstructed thoughts;* (27) endowed with extreme patience; (28) skilfulin teaching others how to penetrate to the true character of reality;(29) acquiring through their vows and their setting-out the endlessharmonies of all the Buddha-fields; (30) always face to face with theconcentrated recollection of the Buddhas of countless world systems;(31) skilful in soliciting4 innumerable Buddhas; (32) skilful in appeasingthe various views, biases, prepossessions, and defilements; (33) and inproducing a hundred thousand concentrations and in playing withthem.

The gods, right up to the Akanishtha gods, areenraptured, (P 36) because the Bodhisattva shuns sexual intercourse.From the first thought of enlightenment onwards the Bodhisattva ischaste. He is not conjoined with fettering dharmas. He reflects that \"onewho is not chaste, who pursues sensuous pleasures, he causes an obstacleto rebirth even in the Brahma world, how much more then to supremeenlightenment\". Therefore a Bodhisattva, chaste, not unchaste, should,having left his home, know full enlightenment.Śāriputra: Does then the Bodhisattva in all circumstances haveparents, wives, sons, paternal and maternal relatives?The Lord: Some Bodhisattvas do. Some of them, from the first thoughtof enlightenment onwards, take chastity upon themselves, and, coursein the course of a Bodhisattva always as Crown Princes until they knowfull enlightment. Some Bodhisattvas taste the five sense qualities throughtheir skill in means, and afterwards leave home and know full enlighten-ment. Just as a clever (P 37) magician or magician's apprentice, welltrained in magical illusions, would conjure up the five sense qualities,delight in them, play with them, minister to them.

Sense desires are disparagedby the Bodhisattva with the words: \"All ablaze are sense desires, disgust-ing, murderous, inimical!\" It is in such a spirit that a Bodhisattva,for the sake of maturing beings, lays hold of the five sense qualities.20For the story of the four bowls see my Buddhist Scriptures, 1959, pp. 52-3.21Or \"solicit\", as in ch. 1 note 4."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3OBSERVATIONS(3.

That is its essential originalnature. (For it is not through emptiness that form^etc. is empty.)

Śāriputra being the interlocutor here, the \"Instructions\"are held to be of a fairly elementary nature.3This passage, P 38-39, became for the Yogācārins the basis of their doctrine of the 10\"discriminations\", and of the 10 \"antidotes\" to them, which are said to be enumeratedhere.

Illusions andmere words do not stand at any point or spot; they are not, do not comeinto being, are false to behold. For of what the own-being is seen to be anillusion, of that there is no production or stopping, no defilement orpurification. Thus a Bodhisattva, a great being who courses in the per-fection of wisdom, also does not review the production (of any dharma);nor its stopping (or abiding, its decrease or increase), defilement orpurification. (He does not review form, etc., nor \"enlightenment\", norwhat is called an \"enlightenment-being\".) And why? Because words areartificial. People have constructed a counter-dharma.5 They express itconventionally by means of an adventitious designation (which isimagined and unreal, and they settle down in that conventionalexpression). A Bodhisattva, a great being who courses in perfect wisdom,does not review (that which is said to correspond to) all those words,(does not get at them). Not reviewing them, (not getting at them, he doesnot mind them), does not settle down in them.3Furthermore, a Bodhisattva, a great being who courses in the perfectionof wisdom, does not consider6 the fact that these are mere words, i.e.this \"Bodhisattva\", this \"enlightenment\", this \"Buddha\", (P39) this\"perfection of wisdom\", this \"coursing in the perfection of wisdom\",this \"form\", etc. Just as one speaks of a \"self, and yet no self is got at,and no being, soul, personality, person, individual, or man, etc., onaccount of unascertainable emptiness.7 And why?

Nor does he wish that \"he mightmore quickly fully know the Realm of Dharma, or not fully know itat all\". (P57) And why?

This is the foremost \"undertaking\"of the Bodhisattva, i.e. the endeavour about emptiness. When he coursesin emptiness, a Bodhisattva does not fall on the level of a Disciple orPratyekabuddha, but purifies the Buddha-field, matures beings, andquickly knows full enlightenment. Among the \"endeavours\" of a Bodhi-sattva the \"endeavour\" about the perfection of wisdom is declared tobe the highest, the best, the choicest, the most excellent, the utmost, the un-surpassed, the peerless, the unequalled, the most sublime. And why ? Thereis nothing above (P59) that \"endeavour\", i.e. above the \"endeavour\"about perfect wisdom, about emptiness, the signless, the wishless. ABodhisattva who is \"endeavouring\" (joining himself) thus, should beborne in mind as predicted (to Buddhahood), as one who has come nearthe prediction. He will work the welfare of countless beings, but it willnot occur to him that \"the Buddhas, the Lords will predict me; I havecome near the prediction; I will purify the Buddha-field; I will maturebeings; I will, after I have known full enlightenment, turn the wheel ofDharma\". And why? Because he does not set apart the Realm of Dharma,nor does he review any dharma as other than the Realm of Dharma, e.g.,him who would course in perfect wisdom, or who would be predictedby the Buddhas, the Lords, to full enlightenment. And why? Becauseno perception of a being is produced in a Bodhisattva, a great being whocourses in perfect wisdom. And why? Because absolutely no being isproduced or stopped, since a being has the nature of nonproductionand of nonstopping And that of which there is neither production norstopping, how will that course in perfect wisdom? Thus coursing, a20\"Realm of Dharma\", dharmadhātu, \"element of Dharma\" is a Mahayana word forthe Absolute. To \"penetrate\" to it means that the thick membrane of ignorance must firstbe pierced. In order to see the Dharmadhātu one must have the equivalent of an operationfor cataract of the eyes.21One cannot join any of the 18 elements to emptiness because one has not got the eye-element here and emptiness there.

It is not at alleasy to grasp the scheme oiAA, which is taken straight from A.K. VI pp. 193-240. In additionits relation to the text of the Sutra is sometimes rather obscure. The reader will also do wellto refresh his memory of the stages of the Path, as well as of the 28 classes of gods {see theNumerical Lists), for, as he will see, a Bodhisattva, once he has reached a certain stage ofperfection, ceases to live on earth and dwells for long periods among the devas.A few remarks are necessary on the method of classification adopted here. The schemeconcerns \"all the holy irreversible Bodhisattvas (see 12, 3c, c) who are still in training\"(H), but the mahayanistic Arhat is omitted from the list, because he belongs to the Treasureof the Buddha (I2,3a). The 20 types are subdivisions of the traditionally well-known \"holypersons\". The text of P gives 24 headings, of which A, B, C and D represent four of these\"holy persons\", i.e. I, IV, VI, and VII. In the Numerical Lists I have tried to clarify thesituation by a diagram. Some light is also thrown on the subject by the comments of AAA(35-36, Ob. 51-56), which I reproduce here in a none too elegant English translation:\"The following varieties of the Congregation of the Bodhisattvas are here considered:I.

The Candidate for the third Fruit has removed 7 or 8 forms of defilement belongingto the world of sense-desire. He may attain this position either by faith or by correctviews, as at I and III.VI. The Never-Returner has removed all 9 forms of defilement belonging to the worldof sense-desire. He can be of five kinds, as follows: (A) 8. The saint who attains Nirvanain an intermediary state of existence, between the world of sense desire and that of pureform. He has forsaken the fetters which bind him to a future rebirth in the world of form,but not those which lead to his reproduction in the existence intermediary between thissphere and that of sense-desire. Whilst he is reproducing himself there, he comes face toface with the Path and thereby reaches the end of 111. (B) 9. The saint who attains Nirvanaas soon as he has been reborn, and since he has not forsaken either of these two kinds offetters, reaches the end of 111 after having been reborn in the sphere of pure form. (C)10. the saint who, born in the world of pure form, wins Nirvana with great effort, and(D) 11. the reverse of him, the saint who wins it without effort. (E) The fifth variety ofNever-returners are those who rise up to the highest regions of the phenomenal world toattain Nirvana there. They again are of two kinds: (x) 12. the saint who has gone up to theAkanishta gods to win Nirvana there, and (xx) 16. the saint who has gone up to the highestsphere of phenomenal existence.

Because in thesix perfections all wholesome dharmas are contained, all Disciple-dharmas, (P83) all Pratyekabuddha-dharmas, and all Bodhisattva-dharmas. When those who speak the Truth have spoken of \"that whichcomprehends all wholesome dharmas\", they have spoken of the per-fection of wisdom.

It is thus that the Bodhi-sattvas who course in perfect wisdom, having stood in the six perfections,cleanse the roadway to the knowledge of all modes, on account of absoluteemptiness.A gift is conceived on account of taking; morality on account ofimmorality; patience on account of impatience; vigour on account ofsloth; concentration on account of lack of concentration; wisdom onaccount of stupidity.45The Bodhisattva does not put his mind to such ideas as \"I have crossedover\", or \"I have not crossed over\";46 giver or no giver; one of goodconduct, one of bad conduct; one who has achieved patience, one whois angry ;47 one who exerts vigour, one who is slothful; (P90) one who isconcentrated, one who is not concentrated; one who is wise, one who isstupid; \"I am abused\", \"I am praised\", \"I am treated with respect\",\"I am not treated with respect\". And why? Because nonproductiondoes not put its mind to such ideas. And why? Because the perfectionof wisdom cuts off all mindings.All the virtuous qualities which come to a Bodhisattva who coursesin perfect wisdom are not found in the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.Perfecting these virtuous qualities, he matures beings, purifies the Buddha-field, and reaches the knowledge of all modes.A Bodhisattva, Sariputra, who courses in perfect wisdom, producesan even state of mind towards all beings. As a result he acquires insightinto the sameness of all dharmas, and learns to establish all beings inthis insight. In this very life he becomes dear and pleasing to the Buddhas,the Lords, and to all Bodhisattvas, Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.Wherever he may be reborn he will never again see unpleasant forms withhis eyes, nor hear unpleasant sounds with his ears (P91), nor smell un-pleasant smells with his nose, nor taste unpleasant tastes with his tongue,nor feel unpleasant sensations with his body, nor become aware ofunpleasant dharmas with his mind. Nor does he fail of full enlightenment.Interlude.When this exposition of perfect wisdom was being expounded, threehundred nuns, wearing their religious garments in a proper and correctmanner,4? made offerings to the Lord, and raised their thoughts to theutmost, right and perfect enlightenment.

WHAT TO BECOME :(I. The meaning of \"Bodhi-being\".)14. The Lineage or the Source of Progress. 2I 4a. THE LINEAGE AS SUCH.*Subhuti: A Bodhisattva is called a \"Bodhisattva\". \"Bodhisattva\",what is meant by that word?xapatrāpya, the chapter heading in AdT, means \"dread of blame\", often coupled withhrī, \"sense of shame\". The explanations of Buddhaghosa, V. M. 464-5 and Vasubandhu,Trimśikā 26-7, agree on essentials. Motivated either by self-respect, or by fear for one'sreputation, one avoids doing that which one ought not to do. It is, however, difficult to seehow this can be regarded as a suitable heading for chapter 11. A Central Asian Ms of Adgives aupamya, \"similes\", which seems to fit better, and may at some time have been corrupt-ed into auttapya=apatrāpya.2I 4 is one of the more unintelligible parts of the Sutra. Since the ostensible meaning isnot very satisfactory, it probably hints at some esoteric teaching. AA groups I 4-6 as follows:\"(The Bodhisattva who proceeds on the mahayanistic path) of progress is thus able toattain the Aids to Penetration (as discussed in I 3) and also the path of vision, and so on.(I 4). His true own-being is the Dharma-element, which is the foundation of his activities,which (I 5) he exercises with all dharmas as the object of his meditation, and (I 6) with thetriple aim which constitutes his program\" (HI6). This arrangement is not altogether im-plausible, although I am not sure that at I 4 it reflects the intentions of the original authorsof the Sutra. According to A A, I 4 concerns the \"lineage\" (gotra) of a Bodhisattva, his truenature, which is nothing else but the Realm of Dharma which through progressive puri-fication becomes fit for enlightenment and represents the source or substratum of the dhar-mas of a Buddha. It is the active element in the Bodhisattva which urges him on to enlighten-ment and which through cultivation by study, etc., has Buddhahood for its final metamor-phosis, 14, 1-13 follow the order of the Bodhisattva's progress or his process of cognition.This is clear for no. 1-6, 7 and 8 are the results of the two supramundane paths of visionand development, \"and resemble the expulsion of thieves and the act of shutting the doorbehind them\", while 9 removes all realistic imputations about this process of producingthe antidotes and stopping the points to be shunned. Then at 10 \"wisdom and compassionmanifest themselves owing to the force of the Bodhisattva's initial vow, his practice of thesix perfections and his skill in means, and they are marked by the fact that he does notabide in either Samsara or Nirvana\"; 10 leads to 11, i.e. the four Means of Conversionand four Analytical Knowledges, to 12 and to 13 (H76-77).

THE GREATNESS OF THE ASPIRATION TO RAISE ALL BEINGS TO THEHIGHEST POSSIBLE STATE.(II. The meaning of \"Great Being\". 1. A Saviour of Many.)*Subhuti: A Bodhisattva is called a \"great being\". For what reason isa Bodhisattva called a \"great being\"?The Lord: He is called a \"great being\" because here he will cause agreat mass of beings, a great collection of beings, to achieve the highest.*Subhuti: What is that great mass of beings, that great collection ofbeings?The Lord: The term \"a great mass and collection of beings\" refersto those who have reached the stage of becoming one of the clan, tothose who have reached the eighth-lowest stage, to Streamwinners,Once-returners, Never-returners, Arhats, to Pratyekabuddhas, to Bodhi-sattvas, great beings, who have had the first thought of enlightenment,until we come to: to the Bodhisattvas who stand on the irreversible stage."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"124   AA16  P169-170That is the great mass and collection of beings which a Bodhisattva willcause to achieve the highest. And he will cause them to achieve thehighest after he has produced an adamantine thought.17Subhuti: What is the production of an adamantine thought?The Lord: Here a Bodhisattva, a great being, produces a thoughtthus: \"After I have in the measureless stream of Samsara put on thearmour, I should become one who never abandons all beings. Towardsall beings should I adopt the same attitude of mind. All beings should Ilead to Nirvana, by means of the three vehicles. (PI70) And even when Ihave led all beings to Nirvana, no being at all has been led to Nirvana.And why? I should look through to the nonproduction and nonstoppingof all dharmas. With my thought exclusively set on the knowledge of allmodes should I course in the six perfections. Everywhere should I trainmyself to accomplish the penetration into all dharmas. To the consum-mation of the one principle of all dharmas should I penetrate, etc.,until we come to: for the sake of the penetration to the consummationof the perfections should I be trained in all dharmas, for the sake of thepenetration to the consummation of the Unlimited, the trances, theformless attainments, the superknowledges, of the ten powers, thegrounds of self-confidence, the special Buddhadharmas\". This is theproduction of an adamantine thought by the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing. Supported thereon he will cause a great mass and collection ofbeings to achieve the highest; and that without depending on anything.18Furthermore, a Bodhisattva, a great being produces the thoughtthat \"For the sake of as many beings as feel a painful feeling in the hells,among the animals, or in the world of Yama I will feel that (same) painfulfeeling!\" Likewise a Bodhisattva should produce a thought thus: \"Forthe sake of each single being I will experience for hundreds of thousandsof niyutas of kotis of aeons the pains of the hells, of the animal world,of the world of Yama, until those beings have won Nirvana in the realmof Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. Through this skill in means willI, for the sake of all beings, experience that pain of the hells, of the animalworld, of the world of Yama, until these beings have won Nirvana in therealm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. Afterwards I will, forthe sake of my own self, know full enlightenment after I have plantedwholesome roots for hundreds of thousands of niyutas of kotis of aeonsand become equipped for enlightenment with a manifold equipment\".This is a Bodhisattva's production of an adamantine thought.Furthermore, in order to achieve the highest for all beings a Bodhi-sattva, should constantly have a sublime thought.

(PI71)This is the sublime state of thought of a Bodhisattva by which he willachieve the highest for all beings. But he does not put his mind to thatthought. Furthermore, a Bodhisattva should become one whose thoughtis unshakable. A Bodhisattva's unshakable state of thought consists inhis not putting his mind even to the mental activities associated with theknowledge of all modes. Furthermore, a Bodhisattva should becomeone whose thought is directed towards the benefit and ease of all beings.The stage of thought which is directed towards the benefit and ease of allbeings consists in the sheltering of all beings, in not abandoning them.But he does not put his mind to that. It is thus that a Bodhisattva, coursingin perfect wisdom, will achieve the highest for all beings.Furthermore, a Bodhisattva should have a constant liking for Dharma,a delight in Dharma, fondness for Dharma, devotion to Dharma. Whathere is Dharma? The unbroken unity of all dharmas. What is the likingfor Dharma? The wish, the eagerness for Dharma. What is delight inDharma? The pleasure in Dharma. What is fondness for Dharma? Theappreciation of its qualities. What is devotion to Dharma? The deve-loping, the making much of that Dharma. It is thus that a Bodhisattva,coursing in perfect wisdom, should achieve the highest for all beings,and that without depending on anything.Moreover, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom shouldachieve the highest for all beings after he has stood in the 18 kinds ofemptiness, the 37 wings of enlightenment, the powers, etc. to : the Buddha-dharmas, (PI 72) and in the concentrations, beginning with the adamantineconcentration and ending with the concentration which is, like space,unshackled, free and untainted—and all that without depending onanything.

And in the same spirit he practises the other perfections.A Bodhisattva is not armed with the great armour if he delimits a certainnumber of beings, and thinks, \"so many beings will I lead to Nirvana,so many beings will I not lead to Nirvana; so many beings will I intro-duce to enlightenment, so many beings will I not introduce to enlighten-ment!\" But on the contrary, it is for the sake of all beings that he isarmed with the great armour, and he thinks, \"I myself will fulfil the sixperfections and also on all beings will I enjoin them\".

This is the perfection of giving of a Bodhisattva who courses in theperfection of morality.

THE ARMOUR OF THE SKILL IN MEANS.Furthermore, a Bodhisattva enters into the trances, Unlimited, andformless attainments, but he does not relish them,4 is not captivated bythem, is not reborn on account of them.5 This, Sariputra, is of a Bodhi-sattva, a great being, the perfection of wisdom which is associated withskill in means. A Bodhisattva furthermore dwells in the trances andformless attainments by way of the vision of detachment, of emptiness,of the signless, of the wishless, and yet he does not realize the realitylimit. This is the great armour of the skill in means of the Bodhisattvawho courses in the perfection of wisdom.17h.

Set out in the great vehicle.)Śāriputra: Through how much does the Bodhisattva become onewho has set out in the great vehicle, one who has mounted on the greatvehicle?I 8,1. THE ENTERING ON AND EMERGING FROM THE TRANCES AND FORMLESSATTAINMENTS.6Puma: Here, coursing in the perfection of giving, a Bodhisattvadwells detached from sense desires, detached from evil and unwhole-some dharmas, in the attainment of the first trance, which is with thoughts4Because trances give a kind of superhuman bliss, a Bodhisattva might be temptedinto seeking them from spiritual voluptuousness.5The trances correspond to a number of heavens (see: Numerical Lists). To practisetrance at a certain stage permits, after death, rebirth in the corresponding heaven. To availhimself of this possibility would for a Bodhisattva mean idle self-indulgence and a merewaste of time.^according to H, the Bodhisattva must at this stage first gain some proficiency in transicmeditation so that his mind may be brought to a state of complete firmness."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132   AA18  P180-181adjusted and discursive, born of detachment, full of rapture and ease.And so for all the four trances, and for the four formless attainments.These are a Bodhisattva's trances and formless attainments. When aBodhisattva courses in the perfection of giving through these trancesand formless attainments, enters into and emerges from them, throughthe modes, characteristics and signs of space makes these wholesomeroots common to all beings, and dedicates them to full enlightenment—then this is a Bodhisattva's perfection of giving. Similarly he acts withregard to the perfections of morality, patience, vigour, and concentration.Moreover, a Bodhisattva, coursing in the perfection of wisdom, entersinto the four trances and the four formless attainments. When a Bodhi-sattva dwells through these trances and attainments in the perfectionof wisdom, and, while entering into and emerging from them attends tothe modes, characteristics and signs of space, and, coursing in the per-fection of wisdom, makes these, and other, wholesome roots commonto all beings, through attentions connected with the knowledge of allmodes, and dedicates them to full enlightenment—then this is a Bodhi-sattva's perfection of wisdom. It is thus that a Bodhisattva, who coursesin the six perfections, is called \"one who has set out in the great vehicle\".18,2. THE SIX PERFECTIONS.Furthermore, it is the perfection of giving of the Bodhisattva if, withhis attention centred on the knowledge of all modes, he produces athought controlled by the great compassion, and thinks, \"for the sakeof the demolition of the defilements will I demonstrate the trances,Unlimited and formless attainments to all beings\".7 It is his untarnishedperfection of morality if, with his attention centred on the knowledgeof all modes, he enters into the trances, and, firmly grounded in them,does not give an opportunity (PI81) to other productions of thoughtassociated with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas. When it occurs to aBodhisattva who, with his attention centred on the knowledge of allmodes, dwells in the trances and formless attainments, that \"for thepurpose of the extinction of the defilements of all beings will I demon-strate Dharma\", then the enduring of those attentions, the willingness tofind pleasure in them, to test and understand them, and to meditate onthem, that is a Bodhisattva's perfection of patience. It is a Bodhisattva'sperfection of vigour that, through his attentions connected with theknowledge of all modes, he dedicates all wholesome roots to full enlighten-ment, and never relaxes his vigour. It is his perfection of concentrationthat, through his attentions connected with the knowledge of all modes,he enters into the trances and formless attainments, and yet does notapprehend them.

THE FOUR UNLIMITED.Furthermore, a Bodhisattva dwells with a thought connected withfriendliness—a thought that is vast, extensive, nondual, unlimited, freefrom hostility, rivalry, hindrance, or injury to anyone, extends every-where and is well cultivated; he radiates friendliness in the ten directionsof the world which has as its highest (development) the Dharma-element,and the space-element as its terminus. And so with compassion, sympa-thetic joy, and impartiality. These are called the four Unlimited ofthe Bodhisattva, the great being. (PI82) A Bodhisattva enters the con-centration on friendliness, and strives to save all beings. He enters theconcentration on compassion, and directs pity and compassion towardsbeings. He enters the concentration on sympathetic joy, and resolves tomake beings rejoice.8 He enters the concentration on impartiality,and \"extends\"9 to beings the extinction of the outflows. This is theperfection of giving of the Bodhisattva who courses in the Unlimited.When a Bodhisattva enters into the modes, characteristics and signs ofthe trances and Unlimited, and emerges from them, and yet does notdedicate (the resulting merit) to the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha,but to nothing else than the knowledge of all modes—then this is theuntarnished perfection of morality of the Bodhisattva who courses inthe Unlimited. When he dwells in those trances, Unlimited, and formlessattainments free from contamination, and does not long for the twolevels of a Disciple or a Pratyekabuddha, but just the knowledge of allmodes seems good to him and pleases him—then this is the perfection ofpatience of the Bodhisattva who courses in the Unlimited.

If, with his attentions centred on the knowledge of allmodes, he enters into the trances, Unlimited and formless attainmentsand emerges from them, and contemplates them under the aspects ofimpermanence, ill, not-self, of quietude, emptiness, signlessness andwishlessness, but does not go forward to the way of salvation of theDisciples and Pratyekabuddhas—then this is the perfection of wisdomof a Bodhisattva who courses in the Unlimited. This is the great vehicleof the Bodhisattva, the great being. (PI83)I 8,5. ABSENCE OF DEVOTION TO A BASIS.10Furthermore, also this is the great vehicle of the Bodhisattva, thegreat being: The cognition of the 18 kinds of emptiness, without takingthem as basic facts. That, since his thought is undisturbed in all dharmas,his cognition is concentrated.11 That his cognition does not proceedthrough \"this is permanent\", \"this is impermanent\", \"this is ill\", etc.to: \"this is wishless\". That his cognition does not proceed in the past,future, or present period; in fact his cognition does not proceed in thethree periods, and takes nothing as a basic fact. That his cognition doesnot proceed in the world of sense desire, in the world of form, in theformless world; in fact he has no cognition of the triple world, and thatbecause nothing can be apprehended in it. That his cognition does notproceed in worldly or supramundane dharmas, in dharmas with orwithout outflows, in conditioned or unconditioned dharmas; in fact hehas no cognition of any of these kinds of dharmas, and that becausethere is nothing to apprehend.

Here aBodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom (PI84), mounts on the perfectionof wisdom. He does not get at the perfection of wisdom, or a Bodhisattva,or an act of attention—because there is nothing to get at.I 8,7. THE PROGRAM.Furthermore, a Bodhisattva is called \"mounted on the great vehicle\"if, through an unmixed production of the thought of the knowledge ofall modes, he develops the 37 wings of enlightenment, etc. to: the 18special Buddhadharmas, with a development in the sense of annihilation12and that because there is nothing that can be got at.Furthermore, a Bodhisattva is called \"mounted on the great vehicle\"if he perceives that \"Bodhi-being\" is a mere conventional expression,since no being can be apprehended. In the same way also all dharmas,from form to the Buddha, are mere words, because the reality corres-ponding to them cannot be apprehended.I 8,8. THE SIX SUPERKNOWLEDGES.Furthermore, during the entire period from the first thought ofenlightenment up to full enlightenment (PI85) he matures beings andpasses on from Buddha-field to Buddha-field, after he has perfectedhis superknowledges. In all Buddha-fields he treats the Buddhas, theLords with respect, honours, reveres, and worships them. Owing to hissuitable worship of those Buddhas and Lords and his manner of showingrespect he hears from them the Dharma, i.e. this great vehicle.

The Yogācārins understood no. 3 quitedifferently.4Because it is merely the cognition of the emptiness of all dharmas.—Pras. XII: Emptinessis not a property, or universal mark, of entities, because then its substratum would benonempty, and one would have a fixed conviction (drsti) about it. In fact it is a mere medicine,a means of escape from all fixed convictions. It is taught so that we may overcome attach-ment, and it would be a pity if we were to become attached to it. It is not a positive stand-point, but a mere turning away from all views and thought constructions. To treat it asan object, and to oppose it to nonemptiness, is to miss the point.5This refers to the Absolute, or dharmadhātu, as all-pervading.

Functional interdependence makes it impossible foranything to have an independent existence. On analysis anything and everything is nothingmore than a bundle of conditions, and the formula \"this being, that is\" binds it up inextri-cably with many factors outside itself.16A \"skandha\" means a \"group, heap, assemblage, conglomeration\". But a conglomera-tion is not a real entity by itself, and can therefore not act as the basis for an existence whichbears the mark of grasping.17It is a non-ens, devoid of an essence of its own.

The second, though it does not exist in itself, is constitutedby the fact that it is the range of the cognition of those who see rightly. The first is constitutedby the power of the false views of the common people, whose intellectual vision is coveredup with the cataract of ignorance\".l9para-bhāva. That which is produced by others. Or, that which differs in relation toanother. Pras. 260: \"Any own-being in relation to another is called 'other-being'\". Warmth,for instance, as the own-being of fire, is \"other-being\" with reference to fluidity, which isthe own-being of water.20This formula also occurs in A.N. i 285 and very frequently elsewhere. See MCB v 207.The \"true nature\" (dharmatâ) of dharmas is the same as conditioned coproduction, whichoperates quite irrespective of the appearance or nonappearance of the Tathagatas whoalone are capable of discovering it.21 Indeed it has been said: Human effort that is directed upon Emptiness will have forits result only useless toil.^The translation of this section is purely speculative.

THE EQUIPMENT WITH THE PATH.1And further, Subhuti, the great vehicle of the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing:1. The Four Applications of Mindfulness. Which four? Mindfulnessas to the body, as to the feelings, as to thought, as to dharmas. (P204)There the Bodhisattva dwells, with regard to the inward body, feelings,etc., in the contemplation of the body, etc. But he does not form anydiscursive thoughts associated with the body, etc. He is ardent, clearlyconscious and mindful, after putting away all worldly covetousness andsadness. And that without taking anything as a basis. And so he dwellswith regard to the outer body, to the inner and outer body, to feelings,thought, and dharmas.(LA) How does a Bodhisattva dwell with regard to the inward bodyin the contemplation of the body?(I.Aa) Here a Bodhisattva knows, when he walks, \"I walk\", whenhe stands, \"I stand\", when he sits, \"I sit\", when he lies down, \"I lie down\".In whichever position his body may be placed, whether in a good wayor not, he knows that it is in that position. And that through nonappre-hension (of anything).(I.Ab) Further, a Bodhisattva is clearly conscious when going outand coming back, when looking towards and looking away, when bendingand stretching (the arms), when carrying his waist-cloth, robe, andalmsbowl; when eating, drinking, chewing, and dispelling exhaustionby sleep; when coming and going, standing and sitting, falling asleepand waking up, speaking and keeping silent, and when retiring for medi-tation. And that through nonapprehension.(I.Ac) Further, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, andwho, mindful, breathes in, knows as it truly is, \"mindful I breathe in\".And so when he breathes out, when he makes a long inhalation (P205)or a long exhalation, a short inhalation, or a short exhalation. Just as apotter, or potter's apprentice, would whirl round a wheel, and, whenmaking a long whirl, he would know, as it really is \"I make a long whirl\";and so also when he makes a short whirl. So also the Bodhisattva. Andthat through nonapprehension.'The translation generally follows S."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154  ,4,4 19, 14  P 205-207(I.Ad) Further, a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, con-templates this very body according to its elements as it really is: there is,in this body, the element of earth, water, fire, and air. Just as a skilfulcows' butcher, or cows' butcher's apprentice, having killed a cow witha sharp knife, cuts it into four quarters, and then examines it, as hestands or sits. Just so the Bodhisattva with regard to the four elements.And that through nonapprehension.(I.Ae) Further, a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, con-templates this very body as it really is, from the sole of the foot upwards,and from the top of the hair downwards, bounded by nails, down, andskin, and filled with manifold impurities. There are in this body: Hairsof the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, hide, flesh, tendons,blood, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, serous membranes, spleen,lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, urine, excrement, tears, grease,sweat, spittle, snot, pus, bile, mucus, lymph, fluid of the joints, dirt,brain, oozings of the eye, oozings of the ear. Just as a husbandman has asack full of all sorts of grain—sesamum, mustard seed, kidney beans,beans, lentils, barley, wheat, rice, husked rice—and a man with eyes(P206) examining them, would know, \"This is rice of such a sort, this issesamum, these are the mustard seeds, etc.\" Just so the Bodhisattva withregard to the parts of the body. And that through nonapprehension.(I.B) And how does the Bodhisattva dwell with regard to the outerbody?(I) When he goes to the burial ground, a Bodhisattva sees all sortsof dead bodies thrown in the burial ground, flung in the charnel-field—one day dead, or two days dead, or three days dead, or four days dead,or five days dead—swollen, dark blue, festering, eaten by worms, ormangled. And thus he compares his own body: \"This body also is ofsuch a dharmic nature, of such an own-being, and it has not gone beyondthis state of affairs\". (II) And so he reflects when he sees dead bodies,cast into the burial ground, six nights dead and seven nights dead, beingdevoured by crows, eagles, and vultures, by jackals, wolves, dogs, orvarious other kinds of animals; or (III) when he sees those dead bodiesflung in the burial ground, mauled, repulsive, foul, and stinking; or(IV) when he sees in the charnel field a chain of bones, smeared with fleshand blood, joined together by tendons; (V) or when he sees those deadbodies, a mere chain of bones, with flesh, blood and tendons all gone(P207); or (VI) when he sees in the charnel field a chain of bones, sepa-rated, nor joined together, disjoined, like shells scattered anyhow on theground; or (VII) when he sees in the charnel field bones scattered in alldirections, i.e. here foot bones, there shin bones, there thigh bones,there a hip and pelvis, there the bones of the spine, there the ribs, therethe neck bones, there the arm bones, there the skull; or (VIII) when he"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"P 207-208  A A19,14   155sees in the charnel field bones, several years old, several hundred yearsold, dried up by the wind and sunshine, white like conch shells; or (IX)when he sees in the charnel field bones, dark-coloured, black-blue, greylike pigeons, rotten, powdered into the likeness of dust upon the ground,he compares his own body, and thinks that \"this body also is of such adharmic nature, of such an own-being, and it has not got beyond thisstate of affairs\".(II.) A Bodhisattva dwells with regard to feelings, inward, outward,and both inward and outward, in the contemplation of feelings, ardent,clearly conscious, and mindful, after putting away all worldlycovetousness and sadness. And that through nonapprehension.(III.) Likewise a Bodhisattva dwells in the contemplation of thought.(IV.) Likewise a Bodhisattva dwells in the contemplation of dharmas.This also is the great vehicle of the Bodhisattva, the great being.2. And again, the great vehicle of the Bodhisattva, the great being,i.e. the four Right Efforts. They are: Here a Bodhisattva, who coursesin perfect wisdom, rouses his will, makes an effort, puts forth vigour,makes his thoughts tense, correctly exerts himself, 1. So as to bring aboutthe (future) nonproduction of evil and unwholesome dharmas, whichhave not yet been produced; 2. So as to bring about the forsaking ofevil and unwholesome dharmas which have been produced; 3. So asto bring about the production of wholesome dharmas which have notyet been produced; 4. So as to bring about the stability, increase, non-disappearance and completion of the wholesome dharmas which havebeen produced. And that through nonapprehension. This also is thegreat vehicle.3. And again, the great vehicle: The four Bases of Psychic Power.They are: 1. Here a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, deve-lops the basis of psychic power which is endowed with concentrationfrom desire-to-do, together with the formative forces of effort—basedupon detachment, dispassion, and cessation, dedicated to self-surrender.And so with 2, 3, 4, where \"desire-to-do\" is replaced at 2 by \"vigour\",at 3 by \"thought\", at 4 by \"exploration\". And that through nonappre-hension. This also is the great vehicle.4. And again the great vehicle: (P208) The five Dominants, i.e. Faith,Vigour, Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.5. And again, the great vehicle: The five Powers, i.e. Faith, Vigour,Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.6. And again the great vehicle: The seven Limbs of Enlightenment,i.e. Mindfulness, Investigation into Dharma, Vigour, Joyous Zest,Tranquillity, Concentration, and Evenmindedness.

And that through nonapprehension.7. And again the great vehicle, i.e. The Eightfold Path. It consists of:Right View, right Intention, right Speech, right Conduct, right Liveli-hood, right Effort, right Mindfulness, right Concentration. What isright View? Here a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, developsRight View as a limb of the Path, based upon detachment, dispassion,and cessation, dedicated to self-surrender. And so for the other seven.And that through nonapprehension.8. And again the great vehicle: i.e. The Three Concentrations, i.e.the emptiness concentration, the signless concentration, the wishlessconcentration. What is the emptiness concentration? The stability ofthought which contemplates all dharmas as empty of own-marks; empti-ness as a door to deliverance. And so with the signless and wishlessconcentration. These three doors to deliverance are the three concen-trations. In them one should train. And that through nonapprehension.9. And again, the great vehicle, i.e. The Eleven Cognitions. They are :The cognitions of suffering, origination, stopping, path, of extinction,of nonproduction, of dharma, the subsequent cognition, the cognitionconforming to worldly convention, the cognition of mastery, the cogni-tion according to fact.2 (P209) 1. The cognition of suffering is the cognitionof the nonproduction of suffering. 2. The cognition of origination is thecognition of the forsaking of origination. 3. The cognition of stoppingis the cognition that ill has been stopped. 4. The cognition of the Pathis the cognition of the Holy Eightfold Path. 5. The cognition of extinctionis the cognition of the extinction of greed, hate, and delusion. 6. Thecognition of nonproduction is the cognition of the nonproduction ofthe places of rebirth, and of becoming. 7. The cognition of dharma isthe cognition which determines the five skandhas as mere artificialconstructs.3 8. The subsequent cognition is the cognition that the eye,and the other sense fields, as well as the physical elements and links areimpermanent, etc. 9. The cognition conforming to worldly conventionis the cognition by the heart of the hearts of other beings and persons.2The text of no. 9 has undergone some corruption in the various versions of the Prajñā-pāramitā, particularly at no. 7 and no. 9-11. At no. 9 samvrti is attested by S, S-Ti, Ad andDa, and there is no need to change it into paracitta. This cognition can well be called \"con-ventional\" because it refers to \"beings\" who have no more than a conventional existence(cf. A.K. VII, 4). The explanation given at no. 10 is that of P. S has \"cognition of the anti-dotes\", and S-Ti \"cognition of the path and of purification\". So there is substantial, thoughnot verbal, agreement. At no. 11 several sources have yathāruta, apparently an old mis-reading ofyathābhūta.3In Ad probably krtrima, to which also the sgyu-mar of S-Ti may correspond, as at S i119. Sanskrit P and S are both corrupt. The apariksatima of S may have been originallysomething like pratikrti—\"Artificial\", or \"counterfeit\"; see /»39."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"P 209-210  AA\\9,U   15710. The cognition of mastery is the cognition of the mastery of the path.11. The cognition according to fact is the Tathagata's cognition of theknowledge of all modes. And that through nonapprehension.10. And again, the great vehicle, i.e. Three Dominants. They are:1. The faculty \"I shall come to understand the not yet understood\",2. The faculty of \"understanding\", 3. The faculty of \"one who has fullyunderstood\". 1. The faculty \"I shall come to understand the not yetunderstood\" is the virtue of faith, vigour, mindfulness, concentration,and wisdom of those persons who are learners and who have not yetcompletely mastered these virtues, do not entirely manifest them, andneed further disciplining. 2. The faculty of \"understanding\" is the virtueof faith, vigour, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom of the personswho are learners and who have mastered them. 3. The faculty of \"onewho has fully understood\" is the virtue of faith, vigour, mindfulness,concentration, and wisdom of the persons who are adepts—of Arhats.Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas and Tathagatas.—And that throughnonapprehension.11. And again, the great vehicle, i.e. Three Concentrations. They are :1. The concentration with thought applied and discursive; 2. The con-centration without thought applied, and with only thought discursive;3. The concentration without either thought applied or thought dis-cursive: 1. Is identical with the first trance (see no. 13,1). (P210) 2. Isthe interval between the first and the second trance. 3. Covers the trancesfrom the second trance to the attainment of the trance of the cessationof perception and feeling. And that through nonapprehension.12. And again, the great vehicle, i.e. the Ten Recollections. They are:The recollection of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Community, of morality,renunciation, the gods, of agitation, of death, of that which concernsthe body, of breathing. And that through nonapprehension.And again, the great vehicle, i.e. 13. the Four Trances, 14. the fourUnlimited, 15. the four formless attainments, 16. the eight deliverances,and 17. the nine attainments of successive stations.13.4 The Four Trances. 1. Here a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, dwells, detached from sense desires, detached from evil andunwholesome dharmas, in the attainment of the first Trance, which iswith thoughts applied, and discursive, born of detachment, full of raptureand ease. 2. Through the appeasement of thoughts applied and dis-cursive, through inward serenity, through the unification of his heart,he dwells in the attainment of the second Trance, which is withoutthoughts applied and discursive, born of concentration, full of raptureand ease. 3. Through distaste for rapture he dwells evenmindedly, mindful,and clearly conscious, and he experiences with the body that ease of which4The detailed description of 13-17 is omitted in P and added from S."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"158  AA19, 14  P210the Holy Ones declare: \"He that is evenminded and mindful dwellsat ease\"; and thus he dwells in the attainment of the third Trance. 4.From the forsaking of ease, from the forsaking of ill, and from the pre-vious going to rest of gladness and sadness, he dwells in the attainmentof the fourth Trance, which is neither painful nor pleasurable, (but) isutter purity of evenmindedness and mindfulness. And that throughnonapprehension.14. The Four Unlimited: 1. Here a Bodhisattva, who courses inperfect wisdom, dwells with a thought connected with Friendliness,a thought which is vast, extensive, nondual, unlimited, free from hostility,rivalry, hindrance or injury to anyone. He radiates friendliness in theten directions of the world, which has as its highest development theDharma-element, and the space element as its terminus. 2. 3. 4. Andsimilarly with Compassion, Sympathetic Joy, and Impartiality,—andthat through nonapprehension.15. The four Formless Attainments: 1. By completely overcomingall perceptions of form, by the going to rest of the perceptions of impact,by not attending to the perceptions of manifoldness, on thinking \"EndlessSpace\", he dwells in the attainment of the station of endless space. 2. Bycompletely overcoming the station of endless space, on thinking \"InfiniteConsciousness\", he dwells in the attainment of the station of infiniteconsciousness. 3. By completely overcoming the station of infiniteconsciousness, on thinking that \"there is not anything\", he dwells inthe attainment of the station of nothing whatever. 4. By completelyovercoming the station of Nothing Whatever, he dwells in the attainmentof the station of neither perception nor nonperception. And that throughnonapprehension.16. The Eight Deliverances: 1. Having form, he sees forms. 2. Notperceiving inward form he sees outward forms. 3. He becomes resolvedon emptiness. 4-7. are identical with the four formless attainments.8. Through having in every way overcome the station of neither per-ception nor nonperception, he dwells in the attainment of the trance ofthe cessation of perception and feeling. And that through nonappre-hension.17. The Nine Attainments of Successive Stations: They are: 1-4, thefour trances; 5-8, the four formless attainments; 9, the trance of thecessation of perception and feeling.18. And again, the great vehicle, i.e. the Ten Powers of a Tathagata.They are: Here, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom,1. wisely knows, as it really is, what can be as what can be, and whatcannot be as what cannot be. 2. He wisely knows, as they really are, thekarmic results of past, future, and present actions and undertakings ofactions, as to place and cause. 3.

He wisely knows, as they really are,the various dispositions of other beings and persons. 5. He wisely knows,as they really are, the higher and lower faculties of other beings andpersons. 6. He wisely knows, as it really is, the Way that leads every-where. 7. He wisely knows, as they really are, the defilement and puri-fication of all trances, deliverances, concentrations, and meditationalattainments, as well as the emergence from them. 8. He recollects hisvarious previous lives. 9. With his heavenly eye he knows the deceaseand rebirth of beings as it really is. 10. Through the extinction of theoutflows, he dwells in the attainment of that emancipation of his heart andwisdom, which is without outflows, and which he has, in this very life,well known and realized by himself. He wisely knows that \"Birth isexhausted for me; the higher spiritual life has been lived. I have donewhat had to be done. After this becoming there will be none further\".And all that without any apprehension whatever. (P211)19. And again the great vehicle, i.e. The Four Çrounds of Self confidence.They are: 1. That I who claim to be fully enlightened am not fully enlight-ened in those dharmas—I see nothing to indicate that anyone, be herecluse, brahmin, god, Mara, or Brahma, or anyone else in the wholeworld, can with justice make this charge. And, as I see nothing to indicatethis, I dwell in the attainment of security, of fearlessness, of self-con-fidence. I claim my exalted place as leader of the herd, rightly roar thelion's roar in the assembly, and set rolling the sacred wheel which cannotwith justice be set rolling by any recluse, brahmin, god, Mara, or Brahma,or anyone else in the world. 2.

THE EQUIPMENT WITH THE STAGES.As Subhuti has said, \"How does a Bodhisattva become one whohas set out in the great vehicle?\" Here, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva, coursingin the six perfections, passes on from stage to stage. How? In the sensethat no dharma ever passes on.1 And why? Because no dharma whatso-ever comes or goes, passes on, or comes near. A Bodhisattva does notmind the stages of dharmas, does not reflect on them. He sets to workon each stage, but does not review2 that stage. Which then are the pre-parations for the stages on the part of a Bodhisattva?I. A Bodhisattva, who proceeds on the first stage, should effect tenpreparations. They are: 1. Resolute intention, in a spirit of nonappre-hension. 2. He should supply (beings) with beneficial things, but withoutapprehending a sign. 3. The same attitude of mind to all beings, butwithout apprehending a being. 4. Renunciation, on account of the non-apprehension of giver, gift, and recipient. 5. Tending the good spiritualfriends, in nonintimacy with them. 6. Search for the good Dharma, onaccount of the nonapprehension of all dharmas. 7. Leaving home againand again, on account of the nonapprehension of a home. 8. Longingfor the body of a Buddha, without apprehending His marks, minorcharacteristics, and signs. 9. The unveiling of Dharma, on account ofthe nonapprehension of a differentiation between dharmas. 10. Truthfulspeech, on account of the nonapprehension of speech (as a separatereality). (P215)II. Furthermore, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who proceeds on the secondstage, attends to eight dharmas and progresses in them. They are: 1.Purity of morality. 2. Gratitude and thankfulness. 3. Firm groundingin the power of patience. 4. The experience of joy and zest. 5. (a) Thenonabandonment of all beings, (b) The manifestation of the great com-passion. 6. Respect and faith for the instructors. 7. Reverence for theinstructors through the fact that he identifies them with the Teacher.8. Search for the perfections exclusively and entirely.1Nag: The Bodhisattva knows that all dharmas, from the very beginning, do not ariseor depart, that they are immobile and incapable of transition, because the Dharma-elementis eternally stable.2Nag: does not seize on its characteristics."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"164  AA19, 16  P 215-216III. Furthermore, on the third stage, one should stand in five dharmas.They are: 1. An insatiable desire to learn much, but without settlingdown in the words. 2. The disinterested revelation of the gift of Dharma,but without conceit about that. 3. The dedication of the wholesome rootsto the purification of the Buddha-field, but without conceit about that.4. Indefatigability in measureless birth-and-death, but without conceitabout that. 5. Establishment in a sense of shame and a dread of blame,but without conceit about that.IV. Furthermore, on the fourth stage, one should stand in ten dharmas,and not abandon them. They are: 1. Dwelling in the forest. 2. Fewnessof wishes. 3. Contentment. 4. The nonabandonment of the austerepenance of the ascetic practices. 5. The nonrenunciation of moral training.6. Loathing of sensuous qualities. 7. Production of a thought connectedwith disgust. 8. Renunciation of all that is (his). 9. An unco wed attitudeof mind. 10. Disregard for all things.V. Furthermore, on the fifth stage, one should avoid ten dharmas.They are: 1. Intimacy with householders and wandering mendicants.2. Jealousy about the families of the faithful. 3. The places where onemeets society. 4. Exaltation of self. 5. Depreciation of others. 6. The tenways of unwholesome action. 7. (a) conceit, and (b) arrogance. 8. Per-verted views. 9. Doubt. 10. Toleration of greed, hate, and delusion.(P216)VI.A. Furthermore, on the sixth stage, six dharmas should be fulfilled.They are the six perfections.VLB. Another six dharmas should be avoided. They are : 1. Disciple-thought. 2. Pratyekabuddha-thought. 3. Worrying thought. 4. Annoyanceabout beggars when one sees them. 5. A thought of sadness, in spite ofthe fact that one must renounce all things. 6. Distraction by beggars.VILA.

One does not seize on 1. a self, 2. a being, 3. a living soul, 4. a person,5. annihilationist views, 6. eternalist views, 7. the notion of a sign, 8.views about causes.

There are 19. no contentionsabout \"empty are the dharmas\", and 20. no obstructions to emptiness.VII.B. One who stands on the seventh stage should fulfil twentydharmas. They are : 1.

Furthermore, on the ninth stage twelve dharmas should be fulfilled.They are: 1. The acquisition of infinite resolve: just as he resolves, sohe succeeds; 2. the cognition of the speech of gods, Nagas, Yakshas,Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas. 3. Thecognition of the exposition of ready speech. The accomplishment of 4. thedescent into the womb, 5. the family, 6. the birth, 7. the clan, 8. the retinue,9. the manner of birth, 10. leaving home, 11. the miraculous harmonyof the tree of enlightenment, 12. the fulfilment of all virtuous qualities.X. When he proceeds on the tenth stage, a Bodhisattva, a great beingis verily to be called a Tathagata.I1. The preparation of resolute intention* consists in that the Bodhi-īqdhyāśaya. At this point the Bodhisattva has already had his first \"thought of enlighten-ment\", and achieved a great deal. Nag: He has cut himself off from the world which hedetests, and is automatically drawn towards Buddhahood. His five spiritual faculties,faith, etc., are sufficiently matured to enable him to distinguish between what is and what isnot conducive to emancipation. Because he has previously had a taste a Perfect Wisdom, hecan now proceed with \"resolute intention\".

But once he has heard thePerfection of Wisdom being preached, and has appreciated it to some extent, he thinks"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"166   AA19, 16  P 217-218sattva procures all wholesome roots, through attentions connected withthe knowledge of all modes.42. He supplies with beneficial things in the sense that, for the wealof all beings, he undertakes the search for the cognition of the greatvehicle.3. The same attitude of mind to all beings5 consists in his aspiringfor the four Unlimited,6 i.e. friendliness, compassion, sympathetic joyand impartiality, and that through attentions associated with the know-ledge of all modes. (P218)4. His renunciation1 means that he gives gifts to all beings withoutdiscrimination.5. In tending the good friends he knows that his good friends are thosewho instigate him to the knowledge of all modes. Those friends he tends,he resorts to them, honours and reveres them.6. He searches for Dharma* by means of attentions associated withthe knowledge of all modes, and he does not fall on the level of Discipleor Pratyekabuddha.deeply about omniscience and resolves by all means (upāya) to escape from his prison,as the Buddhas and Aryas did before him.—Before I 1 was reached, he had made his Vow tobecome a Buddha. Now he begins to act on it.— cf. Si 284 sq.4Nag: (1) As soon as a Bodhisattva produces the thought of enlightenment, he makesthe vow, \"In a future existence I will be a Buddha\". Because it is linked to the vow to becomea Buddha, this thought is connected with omniscience. A Bodhisattva of keen faculties,who has accumulated much merit, whose passions are weak and whose past sins are few,obtains \"resolute intention\" at the very moment of his first thought of enlightenment.(2) The \"thought of enlightenment\" consists in desiring enlightenment wholeheartedly.The attenuation of worldly thoughts in the course of successive lives constitutes the \"atten-tions, etc.\" All the qualities which a Bodhisattva acquires no longer contribute to his presentor future happiness, longevity or security; they exclusively have all-knowledge in view.Just as a miser for no particular reason refuses to part with even a penny, and economisesand accumulates with the sole aim of augmenting his treasure, so the Bodhisattva, whetherhe has many merits or few, seeks for nothing else than to economise and accumulate themwith a view to omniscience.5Nag: All people love their friends and hate their enemies; the Bodhisattva, however,treats friend and foe as the same, as identical.61,3: when he sees beings happy, he exercises Friendliness and Sympathetic Joy, andmakes a vow that he will lead all beings to the happiness of Buddhahood. 2. When he seesthem unhappy, he exercises Compassion, and makes a vow to remove the unhappiness ofall beings. 4. When he sees them neither happy nor unhappy, he produces Impartiality,and makes the vow to induce all beings to renounce all affection and aversion.—\"Aspiresfor\" can also mean \"achieves\".7Nag: The giving up of material objects serves to counteract the desire to keep, hoard,and possess them. When practised long enough, it leads on the seventh stage to the secondkind of renunciation, which consists in giving up the \"bonds\" so as to be able to win enligh-tenment.iH: \"he searches for Dharma\" as an objective support for his activities. Nag: \"Dharma\"here means the holy Scriptures. To \"search for Dharma\" means to copy, recite, and studythem, to meditate on them, and to be willing, if necessary, to sacrifice one's life for them."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"P215  AA19, 16  1677. He again and again leaves home, i.e. in all his births he leaves homelife,9 uncontaminated (by other religious systems) he goes out into thereligion of the Tathagata, and nothing comes to him in between to hinderhim.8. The preparation of longing for the body of a Buddha consists inthat, after he has seen a Buddha-frame, he never again becomes lackingin attention to the Buddha,10 until he becomes one who has reachedthe knowledge of all modes.9. The preparation of the unveiling of Dharma consists in that theBodhisattva, whether the Tathagata is still (visibly) present, or whetherhe has gone into Parinirvana, demonstrates to beings the Dharma—helpful11 in the beginning, helpful in the middle, helpful at the end, goodin sense, well-phrased, perfect, and complete—and in that he reveals theholy life, perfectly pure and highly cleansed—i.e. the Discourses, Dis-courses in Prose and Verse Mingled, Predictions, Verses, Summaries,Origins, Thus-was-said, Birth Stories, Expanded Texts, Marvels, Tales,and Expositions.10. His preparation of truthful speech consists in that as he speaks sohe acts.12II1. The perfect purity of morality consists in the nonattention to Disci-ple-thoughts and to Pratyekabuddha-thoughts,13 and in the nonattention9Nag: The Bodhisattva knows that home life causes and occasions many sins. \"If Iremain in the home life, I shall myself be incapable of observing the pure practices; howthen can I lead others to practise them? If I follow the rules which govern life in a household,I will need a whip, stick, etc., and will torment beings. On the other hand, if my mode oflife conforms to the Good Law, I must violate the rules of life in a household. A choicebetween the two ways of life is therefore inevitable. If I do not abandon my home now,I will nevertheless be compelled to do so at the time of my death; if I renounce it todayon my own, my merit will be great\". The Bodhisattva also reflects: \"Kings and noblemen,as powerful as the gods, seek for happiness, but never find it. Death brutally takes themaway. Today I will, for the sake of beings, leave home life, in order to observe the perfectlypure morality (of a monk), to seek the enlightenment of a Buddha, and to fulfil the causesand conditions of the perfection of morality\".10The \"longing\" results from \"resolute intention\", and leads to a meeting with the Buddhain each life (Nag).\"\"helpful\", also \"lovely, beautiful, good\".nNag: If he lived as a householder, a Bodhisattva would often have to lie. In the Buddha'sDharma, Truth is held in great honour, and it is through Truth that Nirvana is gained.At this early stage Truth is honoured by \"truthful speech\", which can be believed andaccepted by others, and which does not simulate liberality, morality, and spiritualknowledge.13The Disciples, etc., are condemned for the traces of self-seeking in them."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168  AA19, \\6  P 218-219also to other dharmas which make for bad behaviour, or cause delays onthe road to enlightenment.2. A Bodhisattva's gratitude and thankfulness consists in that, (P219)coursing in the Bodhisattva-course, he does not, throughout the roundof birth-and-death, forget a small kindly action (done to him), muchless a big one.143. He is firmly grounded in the power of patience because his mentalattitude to all beings is free from ill will and harming.4. The experience of joy and zest15 consists in the maturing of allbeings.5. This is the manifestation of the great compassion that a Bodhisattva,who courses on the pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva, thinks that \"for thesake of the weal of every single being will I roast in the hells for aeonscountless as the sands of the Ganges, until that being has been establishedin the Buddha-cognition\".16 This fortitude, this indefatigability, for14Nag: Some people believe that they owe their present enjoyments and advantagesto their former merits and say to their benefactors: \"I have my own merit; what benefithave you bestowed on me?\" To counteract this false view, the Buddha here enjoins themto feel \"gratitude\". Although beings have in their former lives acquired a right to happiness(sukha-hetu), they could not enjoy this happiness if present circumstances, among themthe generosity of the benefactors, did not contribute something also. The seed of the cornis in the earth; but without rain it could not germinate. One cannot say that the rain rendersit no service on the pretext that it is the seed which produces the corn. Although the benefitswhich we reap now have been planted by us in the course of our former lives, yet the respectfuland affectionate disposition of our benefactors is an integral part of the benefits. In addition,gratitude is a source of great compassion, and opens the door to wholesome actions. Agrateful person is loved and esteemed by men, and his reputation spreads far and wide;after his death he is reborn in the heavens, and finally he reaches enlightenment. The ungrate-ful are, however, reborn as animals. Moreover the Bodhisattva reflects: \"If I want to saveeven those who have done me harm, why not those who have helped me?\"l5Nag: II 4 follows directly on II 1-3. The Bodhisattva sees that morality has won himpurity of body and speech, that gratitude and patience have won him purity of thought. Sohe \"feels joy\", like a man who has bathed in perfumed water, put on new clothes and nowregards himself in a mirror. Just so the Bodhisattva congratulates himself on having wonsuch excellent qualities. \"Morality,\" he says to himself, \"is the root of trance and wisdom;since today I possess this pure morality, I will easily be able to gain infinite merit\".In addition, established in morality and patience, the Bodhisattva converts beings andcauses them to be reborn in the presence of a Buddha of another region, or among the godsand superior men, where they enjoy happiness, Or he causes them to gain one of the threevehicles. That is why he is said to \"feel joy\".16\"manifestation\"=\"presence\".—Nag. raises an objection: \"Since one cannot takeupon oneself the punishment due to someone else, why does the Bodhisattva make sucha vow?\" The Bodhisattva, in his great resoluteness, loves all beings deeply, and if he couldpossibly do so he would substitute himself for them. Moreover he notices that among menin some sacrifices to the gods substitutes of one person by another are permitted. He thensays to himself, \"in the hells also there will be substitutions of this kind, and I will take theplace of other men\".

Just as one cannot get at the begin-ning of space, or its end, or its middle, on account of the sameness ofthe three periods of time, so also with this great vehicle. That is why onespeaks of a \"great vehicle\".*The Lord: So it is, Subhuti. This great vehicle of the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, (P232) consists in the six perfections, in all Dharani-doors,all concentration-doors, the 20 kinds of emptiness, the applications ofmindfulness, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas.I 10,1. THE PROGRAM OF GOING FORTH.110,1a. GOING FORTH TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STATE.Śāriputra: When again Subhuti has said, \"surpassing the worldwith its gods, men, and Asuras, that vehicle will go forth\", what then is\"the world with its gods, men and Asuras\"? The world of sense desire,the world of form, the formless world. If the world of sense desire, theworld of form, or the formless world were Suchness, Not-falseness,unaltered Suchness, if they were the Unperverted, Truly Real, TrueReality, That which is as it really is, the Permanent, Stable, Eternal, Notliable to reversal, existence, and not nonexistence, then that great vehiclewould not go forth, after having surpassed the world with its gods, men,and Asuras. But because the world of sense desire, the world of formand the formless world have been constructed by thought, fabricatedfrom fictions and feigned, because they are not as reality really is, butentirely impermanent, unstable, not eternal, liable to reversal, and non-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"P 232-234  ,4,4 110,1-2   183existence, therefore this great vehicle will go forth, after having surpassedthe world with its gods, men, and Asuras. And this holds good notonly of the triple world, but the same formula should be applied to theskandhas, the 20 kinds of emptiness, the Dharma-element, Suchness,the Reality limit, the unthinkable element, etc. to: (P233) the applicationsof mindfulness, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas,I 10,1b. THE GOING FORTH WHICH CONSISTS IN FORSAKING.the stages, the fruits of a holy life, from Streamwinner to Buddha, theworld with its gods, men, and Asuras.I 10,1c. THE GOING FORTH WHICH LEADS TO ACHIEVEMENT.and the thoughts which a Bodhisattva produces from the first thoughtof enlightenment up to his arrival at the terrace of enlightenment. If theadamantine cognition were an existent and not nonexistent, then theBodhisattva would not, having known all defilements and their residuesas nonexistent, reach the cognition of the all-knowing which is furnishedwith the best of all modes; but he reaches it because the adamantine(P234) cognition is nonexistent and not an existent. If the thirty-twomarks of a superman which the Tathagata possesses were existentsand not nonexistent, then the Tathagata would not outshine the world withits gods, men, and Asuras with his splendour and majesty; but he out-shines it because the thirty-two marks are nonexistent and not existents.And the same applies to the light with which he irradiates countless worldsystems. If the Tathagata's voice, which has sixty special qualities, werean existent and not nonexistent, then the Tathagata would not make hisvoice resound through countless world systems in the ten directions;but he makes it resound because it is nonexistent and not an existent.If the Tathagata's wheel of Dharma, with its three revolutions and itstwelve spokes, were an existent and not nonexistent, then the Tathagatawould not have turned this wheel of Dharma which cannot, with justice,be turned by any recluse, brahmin, god, Mara, Brahma, or anyone elsein the world; but he has turned it because it is nonexistent and not anexistent. If the beings for whose sake the Tathagata has turned the wheelof Dharma were existents and not nonexistent, then surely he would nothave led those beings to Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana which leavesnothing behind. But because the beings for whose sake the Tathagatahas turned the wheel of Dharma are nonexistent and not existents, there-fore beings have been led to Nirvana, are being led to Nirvana, and willbe led to Nirvana.I 10,2. SAMENESS.Śāriputra: As, Subhuti, you have said, \"the same as space is this"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184  AA I 10,2-3  P 234-237vehicle\", so it is : the same as space is the great vehicle. For these are thefeatures which they have in common : The ten directions are inconceivableof them. (P235) They are not long or short, round or square, even oruneven; not blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, or crystalline; not past,future, or present. No decrease, increase, or loss can be conceived ofthem, no defilement or purification, no production, stopping, stability,instability or alteration of stability. They are not wholesome, unwhole-some, or indeterminate. They are not seen, heard, known, or discerned.They are not cognizable or uncognizable, not discernable or compre-hensible, not to be realised, forsaken or developed, not karma results oror liable to lead to karma results. They are not included in the world ofsense desire, the world of form, or the formless world. They are not withor without greed, with or without hate, with or without delusion. Inthem there is no first thought of enlightenment, no second, etc. to: notenth; none of the stages and none of the fruits. They are not materialor immaterial, (P236) definable or undefinable, resisting or nonresisting,conjoined or disjoined; not permanent or impermanent, at ease or ill,self or not-self, lovely or repulsive, empty or not empty, with sign orsignless, with wish or wishless, calm or uncalm, isolated or unisolated.And in both of them there is no light or darkness, both cannot be seizedor apprehended, and in both of them there is no utterance or nonutterance.In these ways is the great vehicle the same as space.I 10,3. (THE ACTIVITY FOR) THE WEAL OF BEINGS.Again, as Subhuti, you have said, \"as in space, so in this vehicle thereis room for immeasurable, incalculable, and innumerable beings\", so itis. And why? Because from the nonbeingness of beings should the non-beingness of space be knows, and from the nonbeingness of space shouldthe nonbeingness of the great vehicle be known. In this way there is inthis great vehicle room for immeasurable, incalculable, and innumerablebeings. And why? Because what the beings are, and what space is, andwhat the great vehicle is—all that is not got at. Moreover, from the non-beingness of beings should the nonbeingness of space be known; fromthe nonbeingness of space should the nonbeingness of the great vehiclebe known; from the nonbeingness of the great vehicle should the non-beingness of the immeasurable, the incalculable, the innumerable beknown. And why? Because, what the beings are, and what space is, andwhat the great vehicle is, and what is the immeasurable, the incalculable(P237), the innumerable—all that is not got at. Moreover, from the non-beingness of beings should the nonbeingness of space be known; fromthe nonbeingness of space should the nonbeingness of the great vehiclebe known; from the nonbeingness of the great vehicle should the non-beingness of the Unconditioned be known; from the nonbeingness of the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"P 237-240  A A I 10, 3-5  185Unconditioned should the nonbeingness of the immeasurable, theincalculable, the innumerable be known; from the nonbeingness of theimmeasurable, the incalculable, the innumerable should the nonbeingnessof all dharmas be known. And why? Because what the beings are, andwhat the Tathagata is, and what space is, what the great vehicle is, andwhat the Unconditioned is, and what is the immeasurable, the incal-culable, the innumerable, and what all tiharmas are—all these are notgot at. Moreover, from the nonbeingness of self and beings should beknown the nonbeingness of being, soul, person, personality, individual,man, youth, doer, feeler, begetter, and of one who sees; from their non-beingness should be known the nonbeingness of the Reality limit and ofthe unthinkable element; from their nonbeingness should the non-beingness of the immeasurable, the incalculable, the innumerable beknown; from their nonbeingness should the nonbeingness of all dharmasbe known. And why? Because none of these is got at. (P238) And thesame should be done with the skandhas, etc., the six perfections, the 20kinds of emptiness, the applications of mindfulness, etc. to : the Buddha-dharmas, the stages, (P239) fruits, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes.Just as in the Nirvana-element there is room for countless beings, soalso in this great vehicle. It is in this sense that in this great vehicle, as inspace, there is room for immeasurable, incalculable, and innumerablebeings.I 10,4. THE ABSENCE OF EXERTION.Again, as Subhuti has said, \"of this great vehicle no arrival, departure,or abiding can be seen\", so it is. And why? Because dharmas do notmove about. They do not go anywhere, do not come from anywhere,do not abide anywhere. Because the essential original nature of form,etc., does not come from anywhere, nor go to anywhere, nor abide any-where. And that is true of all dharmas. (P240)I 10,5. BEYOND THE EXTREMES.Again, as Subhuti has said, \"of this great vehicle no initial limit isgot at, no final limit, no middle, Self-identical in the three periods oftime is that great vehicle. That is why it is called the 'great vehicle',\" soit is. And why? Because the past period of time is empty of the pastperiod of time, the future empty of the future, the present of the present.The sameness of the three periods of time is empty of the sameness of thethree periods of time. The great vehicle is empty of the great vehicle,the Bodhisattva empty of the Bodhisattva. But emptiness is not one,not two, not three, etc. to: not ten. That is why owing to the samenessof the three periods of time this vehicle of the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, is self-identical. But therein one cannot apprehend \"the same\""},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"186  ,4.4 110,5-6  P 240-242or \"not the same\", greed or dispassion, hate or its absence, delusion orits absence, conceit or its absence, the wholesome or unwholesome, whathas outflows or what has none, what has blemishes or what has none,defilement or nondefilement, extinction or nonextinction of defilement,the worldly or the supramundane, defiling or purification, Samsara orNirvana, permanence or impermanence, ease or ill, self or not self,calm or uncalm, the world of sense desire or the transcending of theworld of sense desire, the world of form or its transcending, the formlessworld or its transcending. And why? Because the own-being of all thatcannot be apprehended. Past form, etc., is empty of past form, etc. Andso is future, and present form, etc. And why? In emptiness (P241) onecannot get at past, future or present form, etc. The very emptiness, however empty, cannot be got at in emptiness, how much less past, future, andpresent form, etc.! One cannot get at the initial limit of the perfectionof giving, etc., nor at its final limit, nor can one get at it in the present,owing to the sameness of the periods of time. Nor can one get at the past,future, or present period of time in the sameness of the periods of time;the very sameness even cannot be got at in the sameness; how againcould one, in sameness, get at the past, future, present perfection of giving,etc. ? And what is true of the perfections, that holds good also of theapplications of mindfulness, (P242) etc. to: the Buddhadharmas. More-over, the common people cannot be got at, in their initial limit, theirfinal limit, or in the present, owing to the sameness of the periods oftime. And why? On account of the fact that no beings can be got at. Andthat is equally true of Disciples, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, andTathagatas. It is thus that a Bodhisattva, who has stood firm in perfectwisdom and has trained himself in the three periods of time, should fulfilthe knowledge of all modes. This is of a Bodhisattva the great vehicle,on account of the sameness of the three periods of time. Having stoodfirmly therein the Bodhisattva, surpassing the world with its gods, men,and Asuras, will go forth to the knowledge of all modes.I 10,6. ATTAINMENT.110,6a. GOING FORTH TO ATTAINMENT.D. ATTAINMENT.(1. The Bodhisattva goes forth to attainment.)Subhuti: Well said, O Lord. Well has the Lord taught this greatvehicle of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings. In the past period, theBodhisattvas, who have trained in this great vehicle, have reached the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"P242  AA I 10, 6   187knowledge of all modes. Future Bodhisattvas also, by training in thisgreat vehicle, will reach the knowledge of all modes. And those Bodhi-sattvas also who, in this world in all the ten directions, are present ininnumerable world systems, they, having trained in this great vehicle, doreach the knowledge of all modes. This therefore is the great vehicle ofthe Bodhisattvas, the great beings, owing to the fact that they are thesame in the three periods of time.*The Lord: So it is, Subhuti. Having trained in this great vehicle,past, future, and present Bodhisattvas have reached the knowledge ofall modes, will reach it, do reach it.*"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20NONDUALITY*Purna: This (P243) Elder Subhuti, O Lord, when requested by theTathagata to speak about perfect wisdom, fancied that the great vehiclewas something that could be explained!Subhuti: I hope, O Lord, I have not transgressed against perfectwisdom when explaining the great vehicle!The Lord: In agreement with perfect wisdom, you have Subhuti,explained the great vehicle.* And why? Because whatever wholesomedharmas there are that act as wings to enlightenment—be they Disciple-dharmas, Pratyekabuddha-dharmas, Bodhisattva-dharmas or Buddha-dharmas—they are comprehended in Perfect Wisdom and come togethertherein.Subhuti: Which are these wholesome dharmas?The Lord: They are the applications of mindfulness, etc. to: theeighteen special Buddha-dharmas, the state of being always mindfuland evenminded. They are all comprehended in the perfection of wisdomand come together therein. But what the great vehicle is, what the per-fections are, what the applications of mindfulness, etc. to : the Buddha-dharmas, what the Dharma-Vinaya made known by the Tathagata,what form, etc., is, (P244) what the Dharma-element, Suchness, theReality limit, the unthinkable element, and Nirvana—all these dharmasare neither conjoined nor disjoined, they are immaterial, undefinable,nonresisting, with one mark only, i.e. no mark. In this way you describe,Subhuti, the great vehicle in agreement with the perfection of wisdom.And why? Because the great vehicle is not one thing, and the perfectionof wisdom another, the perfection of concentration, etc., again another.For the great vehicle and the perfection of wisdom, and the other per-fections, are not two nor divided. Nor is the great vehicle one thing,and the applications of mindfulness, etc. to : the Buddhadharmas another.In this way you describe, Subhuti, the great vehicle in agreement withthe perfection of wisdom.I 10,6b. NEGATION OF SOMETHING TO BE ATTAINED.(2. Impossibility of A t tainmen t:(a) Nothing is ever really brought forth)*Subhuti: Furthermore, O Lord, a Bodhisattva (who sets out on his"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"P 244-246  ,4,4 110,6  189journey) does not approach (the goal of full Bodhisattvahood)1 fromwhere it begins, nor from where it ends, nor in the middle either. Fromthe boundlessness of form, etc., should the boundlessness of a Bodhisattvabe known. A Bodhisattva's form, etc. does not exist, cannot be appre-hended. Since in each and every way I do not get at a Bodhisattva, orsee him, what Bodhisattva should I instruct and admonish in whatperfection of wisdom? (P245) Moreover, this \"Bodhisattva\" is a meredesignation. It is as with the self. Although we speak of a \"self, yetabsolutely the self is something uncreated.2 Since therefore all dharmashave no own-being,3 what is that form which is something uncreated?What is uncreated, that is not form etc. How shall I instruct and admonisha noncreation in a perfect wisdom which is also a noncreation? And yet,one cannot apprehend as other than uncreated (the dharmas of) a Bodhi-sattva who courses towards enlightenment. If, when this is being ex-pounded, the thought of a Bodhisattva does not become cowed, stolid,or regretful, and if his mind does not tremble, is not frightened, norterrified, then that Bodhisattva, that great being courses in perfectwisdom.*Śariputra: For what reason, Ven. Subhuti, do you say that \"a Bodhi-sattva does not approach from the beginning, end, or middle\"?Subhuti: It is because of the nonbeingness, the emptiness, the isolated-ness of a being, because of the absence of an own-being in it,that a Bodhisattva does not approach (a Bodhi-being) at the beginning,at the end, or in the middle. And why? Because as a result of the non-beingness of a being, its emptiness, its isolatedness, and the absenceof own-being in it one cannot apprehend its beginning, etc. Nor is thenonbeingness of a being, (P246) its isolatedness, its emptiness, the absenceof own-being in it, one thing, and a Bodhisattva another, and beginning,middle, and end again another; for all these are not two nor divided.lnopaiti; see Introduction p. 24.—\"from where it begins\", etc., pūrva-antato. Whereverthe term anta, \"end\", occurs, a satisfactory English translation is almost impossible. Theterm is used here for the temporal limits of an event, i.e. the beginning and the end, theinitial and the final limit. In addition it means, in a derogatory sense, any \"extreme\", or anyof two correlative terms. It is the task of wisdom to rise above these \"extremes\", to contact athing beyond the limits which arbitrarily confine it, and thus to penetrate to the Absolute.In consequence, aty-anta-tayā \"because of beyond-end-ness\" is usually translated as\"absolutely\". The idea behind all this is that to isolate a thing from the remainder of realityis due to our self-seeking practical purposes, and is aided and abetted by the use of wordswhich make artificial boundaries where there are none in reality itself. Each event is boundup with all others, and temporal and spatial limitations spring only from craving andignorance.2anabhinirvrtta; see Introduction pp. 24-25.

Nor is nonbeingness one thing, emptiness another,isolatedness another, lack of own-being another, a Bodhisattva anotherform, etc., another, beginning, end, and middle another; but all theseare not two nor divided.4 And that should be done for all dharmas. (P247)110,6c. NEGATION OF SOMEONE WHO ATTAINS.Śariputra: As again, Subhuti, you say: for what reason \"should theboundlessness of a Bodhisattva be known from the boundlessness ofform, etc.\"?Subhuti: Form, etc., is the same as space. And why? (P248) Of spaceone cannot apprehend a beginning, end, or middle, but it is because ofits endlessness and boundlessness that one speaks conventionally of\"space\". Just so one cannot apprehend a beginning, end, or middle ofform, etc. And why? On account of the emptiness of form, etc. Of em-ptiness one cannot apprehend a beginning, end, or middle, and yet onenevertheless speaks conventionally of \"emptiness\". And so for alldharmas. It is by this method that the boundlessness of a Bodhisattvashould be known from the boundlessness of form, etc.Śariputra: For what reason do you say that \"a Bodhisattva's formdoes not exist, cannot be apprehended\"?Subhuti: Form, etc., is empty of form, etc. And why? Because inemptiness form, etc., as well as the Bodhisattva, does not exist (andcannot be found).5 And so for all dharmas. (P249) The Disciple is emptyof Discipleship, the Pratyekabuddha of Pratyekabuddhahood, theTathagata of Tathagatahood. And why? For in emptiness the Tathagatadoes not exist, nor does a Bodhisattva. It is in this way that a Bodhisattva'sform, etc., does not exist, cannot be apprehended.Śariputra: For what reason do you say that \"since in each and everyway I do not get at a Bodhisattva, or see him, what Bodhisattva shouldI instruct and admonish in what perfect wisdom\"?Subhuti: In form, form cannot exist or be apprehended. In feelingform cannot exist or be apprehended, nor can feeling in feeling, feelingin form, form and feeling in perception, perception in perception, per-ception in form, perception in feeling, form in feeling and perceptionand impulses, impulses in impulses, impulses in form and feeling andperception (P250), consciousness in form and feeling and perception and4Chapter 13 of S begins here in Ghosha's edition, but in Gilgit P the beginning of ch. 13on f. 118a coincides more suitably with that of ch. 21 of Ad.5na samvidyate can have both these meanings."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"P 250-252  AA 110,6  191impulses.

In Bodhisattvahood the Bodhi-sattva cannot exist or be apprehended, nor can the Tathagata in Tatha-gatahood, the perfection of wisdom in the perfection of wisdom, theperfection of wisdom in the instruction and admonition, or the instructionand admonition in the perfection of wisdom. It is thus because all dharmasdo not exist and are baseless, that the Bodhisattva does not exist andcannot be apprehended.110,6d. NEGATION OF BOTH OBJECT AND SUBJECT OF ATTAINMENT.Śariputra: For what reason, Subhuti, do you say that \"a 'Bodhisattva'is a mere designation\" ? And why do you say that \"the word 'Bodhisattva'has been added on as an adventitious designation\"?6Subhuti: Because words do not come from anywhere in the ten direc-tions, nor do they go to anywhere, nor do they stand anywhere. Andthat holds good of the words applied to all dharmas and also thoseapplied to the Bodhisattvas. For \"form\", etc., are adventitious designa-tions, and what is a designation that is not actually form, etc. And why?For words are empty of the own-being of words, and what is empty,that is not a word.7 It is for this reason that the word \"Bodhisattva\"is said to be a mere designation.8 (P251)Śariputra: For what reason, Subhuti, do you say that \"although wespeak of a 'self, yet absolutely the self is something uncreated\"?Subhuti: Absolutely a self does not exist; how then could its realcreation take place? And that is true also of the synonyms of 'self, likebeing, soul, etc.; and also of form, etc., and all dharmas. (P252)Śariputra: For what reason has the Ven. Subhuti said that \"all dharmashave no own-being\"?Subhuti: Because an own-being acting in casual connection doesnot exist.Śariputra: Of what is there no own-being acting in casual connection?Subhuti: Of form, etc. By this method all dharmas are without own-being. Moreover, Śariputra, all dharmas are impermanent, but notbecause something has disappeared.10Śariputra: Which are those all-dharmas which are impermanent,but not because something has disappeared?6\"added on\"=\"superimposed (on what is really there) as a mere product of social con-vention\", //.—\"adventitious\" also at P 38.

Perfect wisdom and a noncreationare therefore not two not divided.Śariputra : For what reason \"can one not apprehend as other thanuncreated (the dharmas of) a Bodhisattva who courses towards en-lightenment\"?Subhuti : Because a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,does not review a noncreation as one thing, and a Bodhisattva as another.A Bodhisattva and a noncreation are not two nor divided.

Becausethere is no agent who could bring them about, nor can such an agent beapprehended.Śariputra: For what reason, Subhuti, is \"that which is uncreatednot form, etc.\"?Subhuti : Because form, etc., is empty in its essential nature.

Perfect wisdom and a noncreationare therefore not two not divided.Śariputra : For what reason \"can one not apprehend as other thanuncreated (the dharmas of) a Bodhisattva who courses towards en-lightenment\"?Subhuti : Because a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,does not review a noncreation as one thing, and a Bodhisattva as another.A Bodhisattva and a noncreation are not two nor divided.

And why? Because no dharmaever leans on another.*Śariputra : In what way do all dharmas not lean on anything?Subhuti : Form, etc., is empty in its essential original nature. It is notinwardly supported, not outwardly supported, and it cannot be appreh-ended anywhere between both.10 In this manner all dharmas do notlean on anything, on account of the emptiness of their essential originalnature.

THE SUPRAMUNDANE PERFECTION OF GIVING.The supramundane perfection of giving, on the other hand, consistsin the threefold purity. What is the threefold purity? Here a Bodhisattvagives a gift, and he does not apprehend a self, a recipient, or a gift; alsono reward of his giving. He surrenders that gift to all beings, but doesnot apprehend those beings, or himself either. And, although he dedicatesthat gift to the supreme enlightenment, he does not apprehend anyenlightenment. This is called the supramundane perfection of giving,(P265) and it is called \"supramundane\" because one swerves awayfrom the world, departs from it, passes beyond it. In the same way shouldthe difference between the worldly and the supramundane perfectionsof morality, patience, vigour, and concentration be understood.Śariputra : What is the worldly, and what the supramundane perfectionof wisdom?I 10,8c. THE WORLDLY PERFECTION OF WISDOM.Subhuti : This is the worldly perfection of wisdom : Here a Bodhisattvagives a gift, leaning on a basis, i.e. he thinks that \"I should suppress allniggardly thought in myself.

While he tends those ten ways of whole-some action, leaning on the views of self, a being and wholesomeness,he dedicates those moralities, made common to all beings, to an enlighten-ment which he has apprehended, and throughout basing himself onsomething.—He exalts not himself, nor depreciates others, and enduresbeing ill-treated by all, while leaning on the views of self, a being, and pati-ence.

He makes the wholesome rootscommon to all beings and dedicates them to enlightenment, but alwayshaving some basis in view.—He develops emptiness, and he apprehendsthat everything from form to the enlightenment of a Buddha is empty,always basing himself on something. Those wholesome roots he makescommon to all beings and dedicates them to the supreme enlightenment(P266), but by way of assuming a basis.—He confesses all the evil he hasdone, by way of assuming a basis, and rejoices at his own merit and thatof others. For his own sake and that of others he entreats the Buddhasfor instruction, but while basing himself on something. Without skillin means he dedicates the merit (from his confession, rejoicing, andentreaty) to all-knowledge, having first made it common to all beings.This is called the worldly perfection of wisdom.I 10,8d. THE SUPRAMUNDANE PERFECTION OF WISDOM.What, on the other hand, is the supramundane perfection of wisdom ?Through his nonapprehension of self, beings, gift, or enlightenment,and through the threefold purity, he cleanses the perfection of givingfor enlightenment. Through his nonapprenehsion of self, being, morality,or enlightenment he cleanses the perfection of morality for enlightenment;and likewise the perfection of patience by the nonapprehension of self,beings, enduring, and enlightenment; the perfection of vigour by thenonapprehension of self, physical and mental vigour, merit and cognition,and enlightenment; the perfection of concentration by the nonapprehen-sion of self, beings, trances and concentrations and attainments, andenlightenment; the perfection of wisdom by the nonapprehension ofself, beings, all-dharmas and enlightenment. He dedicates all wholesomeroots to the supreme enlightenment, by means of a dedication whichis undifferentiated, supreme, equal to the unequalled, unthinkable,incomparable, and measureless.

Such a Bodhisattva dwells in thisdwelling, and is not lacking in this attention.12 This being so, Ven. Subhuti,all (P268) beings must already be Bodhisattvas. And why? Because allbeings are not lacking in attention.Subhuti : Well said, Sariputra. And yet I must reprove you, for theVen. Sariputra has grasped the matter correctly only as far as the wordsare concerned. And why? One should understand that the nonbeingnessof attention results from that of beings; that the emptiness of attention,its lack of ownbeing, and its isolatedness result from the emptiness ofbeings, their lack of own-being, their isolatedness; that acts of attentiondo not undergo the process which leads to enlightenment in the sameway in which beings do not undergo that process. Similarly one shouldunderstand that the nonbeingness, emptiness, etc. of attention resultsfrom the nonbeingness, emptiness, etc. of form, etc. It is by this methodthat a Bodhisattva, a great being, should be known as not lacking inthis dwelling and in this kind of attention, which is the attention of thegreat compassion.*13The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well said.

As potentialTathagatas we shall henceforth bear in mind those Bodhisattvas, greatbeings, who shall not be lacking in this perfection of wisdom. And yet,no dharma at all can be apprehended, no form, etc. to knowledge ofall modes, how much less can one conceive of a definite distinction bet-ween the three vehicles, i.e. the Disciple-vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle and the great vehicle.The Lord : So it is, O Gods, so it is! As you have said. No dharma canbe apprehended, and no definite distinction between the three vehiclescan be conceived. As a Thathagata should the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, be borne in mind who will not be lacking in this perfection ofwisdom, and does not treat it as a basis. And why? Because in thisperfection of wisdom the three vehicles are explained in detail, i.e. theDisciple-vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, and the great vehicle.And yet, the Tathagata cannot be apprehended apart from the six per-fections, or the 20 kinds of emptiness or the knowledge of all modes.The Bodhisattvas, the great beings, train in all dharmas, in the perfectionof giving, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes.

Becauseemptiness cannot gain entry into emptiness, nor the signless into thesignless, nor the wishless into the wishless.

Thereupon all the gods in this greattrichiliocosm said to the Lord: We shall always arrange for the shelter,defense, and protection of those sons and daughters of good family whowill take up this perfection of wisdom, etc. and will not be lacking in thedwelling in all-knowledge. And why? Because it is thanks to the Bodhi-sattva that the hells are cut off, the animal births, the world of Yama,the worlds of the Asuras, and among men poverty, calamities, and mis-fortunes are cut off.Thanks to the Bodhisattva there is in the world a manifestation of theten wholesome karma paths. And so of the four trances ... Buddha-dharmas; of wealthy warrior families, wealthy Brahmin families, thefamilies of wealthy householders; of universal monarchs.

But it is thanks to the Bodhisattva, the great being, that allDisciples and Pratyekabuddhas are manifested in the world; and so theTathagatas.

Whatever morality he guards ...When he courses thus, there arises in the son or daughter of good family,who courses in the six perfections, this mindful recollection: If I do notgive gifts, I shall be reborn in the states of woe, and there will be nomaturing of beings (for me), nor a purifying of the Buddha-field, norwill I gain all-knowledge. It occurs to him: If I do not guard morality,there will be for me a rebirth in the three states of woe, and not amongmen or gods, and neither the maturing of beings nor the purifying of theBuddha-field will be done, and all-knowledge will not be acquired. Itoccurs to him: If I do not develop patience, my faculties will go to pieces,my face will be (disfigured?), nor will I acquire that perfect form by themere sight of which, when I course on the course of a Bodhisattva, beingsbecome fixed on supreme enlightenment, nor can I mature beings throughmy perfecjt form or purify the Buddha-field, and how much less will Iacquire all-knowledge. It occurs to him: When I become lazy and do notdevelop the path of a Bodhisattva, and do not exert vigour, how can Ifulfill the Buddhadharmas, and how can I gain all-knowledge. It occursto him: If I become one with distracted thoughts, then I cannot trainin the achievement of all concentrations, nor can I mature beings, orpurify the Buddha-field, how much less can I gain the knowledge of allmodes. It occurs to him: If I, weak in wisdom and unskilled in means,having transcended the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,having matured beings and having purified the Buddha-field (except to),fully know all-knowledge ... I would not fulfill the perfection of givingthrough meanness, the perfection of morality through immorality, theperfection of patience through ill-will, the perfection of vigour throughsloth, the perfection of meditation through distraction, the perfectionof wisdom through stupidity.

To aBodhisattva who develops worldly patience it occurs: 'I course in theperfection of patience, I fulfill the perfection of patience,' and throughthat he becomes arrogant. And so with a Bodhisattva who exerts worldlyvigour, who enters on worldly concentration, who develops worldlywisdom. To a Bodhisattva who has stood in the development of theapplications of mindfulness it occurs: 'I develop the applications of mind-fulness I shall obtain the knowledge of all modes'. (Not?) coursing inthese I-making dharmas, he gives gifts, but he does not apprehend the gift,or the giver, he does not apprehend the recipient, and he does not appre-hend that which he bestows. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing who courses in perfect wisdom, has been set up for control and fortransformation.Likewise, when he develops the other five perfections, he does notapprehend anything.

Because for a long time they have, coursing in this perfectionof wisdom, vanquished the arrows and swords of their own greed, of theirown hate, of their own delusion, and also the arrows and swords of the(greed), hate, and delusion of others they have vanquished; they havevanquished the arrows and swords of their own wrong views, obsessions,and evil inclinations, as well as those of others. It is in this way that anarrow or sword aimed at the body of this son or daughter of good familydoes not actually hit him.II 5,4.

THE WORTHINESS OF BEING WORSHIPPED.Moreover, Kauśika, where this perfection of wisdom, after it has beenwritten down, has been taken up, etc. there men and ghosts who seek forentry, who search for entry, do not gain entry. And why? Because there,so as to worship the perfection of wisdom, all the gods in the great trichi-liocosm arrange shelter, defense, and protection for these sons anddaughters of good family who will bear in mind this perfection of wisdomafter it has been written down. And those gods will come there to honour,revere, and worship the perfection of wisdom, and, having worshipped it,they will go away again. He who bears in mind and preaches this per-fection of wisdom after it has been written down will have these qualitiesand advantages belonging to this life. Just as those who have gone tothe circumference of the terrace of enlightenment, or to its interior,cannot, even with the help of evil animal beings, be hurt or injured bymen or ghosts. And why? Because, seated on it, the Tathagatas of thepast have known full enlightenment, and so do those of the future andof the present; and after they have known full enlightenment, theyestablish all beings in ease, fearlessness, freedom from anxiety, lack offright, nonenemity, inviolability and undisturbed peace, and, havingdone so, they establish countless beings in heavenly and human benefits,in the fruit of a Stream winner, etc. And why?

It is through training in the per-fection of wisdom that I have obtained the knowledge of all modes.It is not by his acquisition of this body (which is the basis of the relics)that the Tathagata derives his name, but from his having acquired theknowledge of all modes. And this knowledge of all modes has come forthfrom the perfection of wisdom. Just so this body is the true foundationof the cognition of the knowledge of all modes. And, supported by thisfoundation has the Tathagata obtained the knowledge of all modes.Thus as the true foundation of that cognition of the knowledge of allmodes has this body become a true shrine for all beings, worthy of beingrevered, adored, worshipped, honoured and saluted respectfully. Just so,when I have gone to Parinirvana, also my relics will be worshipped.The son or daughter of good family who, having written this perfectionof wisdom, will take it up, study, and bear it in mind, etc. to: honour,revere, adore, and worship it with flowers, etc. he will perform worshipto the cognition of the knowledge of all modes.

And so willall the gods, up to the Highest Gods. And those Mahabrahma gods whohave made a vow to win the supreme enlightenment will come there,learn, study, bear in mind, recite and respectfully salute this perfectionof wisdom, and then they will depart again. And so with the gods, fromthe Gods of the Pure Abode to the Highest Gods. And that son or daugh-ter of good family should wish that all the gods in the world systems inall the ten directions, who have set out for full enlightenment, as wellas other gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras,and Mahoragas should, after having come there and learned, etc. to:worshipped this perfection of wisdom, come there again and receivethis gift of Dharma.

But thosedeities of minor power, who had before occupied that place, they willdecide to leave it, for they cannot endure the majesty and splendourof those very powerful gods. And as often as those very powerful godsapproach, so those sons and daughters of good family will be muchconfirmed in their faith. And in that place one should not form anyunclean or impure habits, and it should be adorned with flowers, incense,perfumes, garlands, ointments, aromatic powders, strips of cloth,parasols, banners, and flags; it should be overstrewn with sweet smelling,loose flowers; garlands and bundles of strips should be suspended, andan awning should erected; in many ways therefore should this placebe adorned. Moreover, the body of that son or daughter of good familywill not get tired. On the contrary it will be at ease and achieve lightnessfor the sake of the happiness of many people. And that son or daughterof good family will know lightness, flexibility, and ease in both bodyand thought. At ease he sleeps at night.

And why? It is not, O Lord, thatI lack in respect for these relics of the Tathagata, and it is not that I amunwilling to honour, revere, and worship them. But I am fully aware,O Lord, that the relics of the Tathagata have come forth from the perfec-tion of wisdom and that for that reason they are honoured, revered,and worshipped; I am aware that they are saturated with the perfectionof wisdom, and for that reason they become an object of worship.Śariputra : The perfection of wisdom, Kauśika, cannot be seized, it isundefinable and nonreacting, and has one mark only, i.e. no mark.How then can you think that it can be something that should be takenup? And why? For the perfection of wisdom has not been establishedfor the sake of appropriation or nonappropriation, of diminution orgrowth, of adding something or taking it away, of defilement or puri-fication; it does not bestow the dharmas of a Buddha, nor does it spurnthe dharmas of the common people; it does not bestow the dharmas ofa Bodhisattva, Pratyekabuddha, or Disciple; it does not bestow thedharmas of learners or of adepts, not the conditioned nor the uncondi-tioned element, nor the various kinds of emptiness, the perfections,the applications of mindfulness, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas.Śakra : So it is, Ven. Śariputra, as you say. The perfection of wisdom isnot the donor of the Buddhadharmas, etc. to: all-knowledge. And why?Because it is not set up as twofold, but is nondual. And that holds goodalso of the other perfections.The Lord : Well said, Kauśika, so it is as you have explained. Onewould wish for a duality in the Dharma-element if one were to wishfor a duality in the perfection of wisdom. And why? Because the Dharma-element and the perfection of wisdom are not two nor divided.

Having trained in it theBodhisattva knows full enlightenment. When I am seated on my owngodly seat in Sudharmā, the hall of the gods, then the gods who come alongto wait on me salute me as I am seated there. But when I am not thereon my own lion seat, then the gods salute this, my seat, and go awayagain. For they recall that seated on this Dharma-seat Śakra, Chiefof gods, demonstrates Dharma to the gods of the Thirty-three. Likewisedivinities from all the ten directions, as well as gods, Nagas, etc. to:Mahoragas will come to the place into which a copy of this perfectionof wisdom has been put, and where it is repeated and explained to others,and they will pay homage to that perfection of wisdom and then goaway again. For they recall that from it have come forth the Tathagatas,and from it has come everything that brings ease to all beings; they willrecall that even the relics of the Tathagata become an object of worshiponly because they are saturated with the perfection of wisdom; thatthe perfection of wisdom is the essential practice of a Bodhisattva andthe true foundation and cause of the cognition of the all-knowing andthat it nourishes it. Therefore, O Lord, presented with the two lotsmentioned before, I would choose just the perfection of wisdom. Andwhenever, having taken up this perfection of wisdom and repeating itwith a mind pervaded by Dharma, I pay homage to the perfection ofwisdom, I do not perceive a sign which indicates its existence as a stableentity (?). And why? Because the perfection of wisdom is signless, withoutattributes, is not to be talked about and incommunicable. And so arethe other perfections, and so is everything up to all-knowledge. If, OLord, the perfection of wisdom had signs and attributes, if it could betalked about and communicated, instead of being signless, withoutattribute, inexpressible and incommunicable, then the Tathagata, havingknown all dharmas as signless, without attributes, inexpressible, andincommunicable, would not have, after fully knowing the supremeenlightenment, demonstrated to beings a Dharma which is signless,without attribute, inexpressible and incommunicable. But because thisperfection of wisdom is signless, without attribute, inexpressible, andincommunicable, therefore the Tathagata, after knowing all dharmasas signless, without attributes, inexpressible, and incommunicable has,after fully knowing the supreme enlightenment, demonstrated the Dharmato beings as signless, without attributes, inexpressible, and incom-municable.II 6,3,3.

And why? Because from it have come forththe relics of the Tathagata, and for that reason are they honoured,revered, and worshipped, and for that reason also the sons and daughtersof good family who have honoured, revered, and worshipped it are nomore reborn in the great distress of the wretched destinies. But, havingexperienced the achievements open to gods and men they enter Nirvanain accordance with their original vow, i.e. through the vehicle of theDisciples, or that of the Pratyekabuddhas, or the great vehicle. In factthe vision of the Tathagata and the vision of the perfection of wisdomare of equal value.

And why? Because from this perfection ofwisdom has the triple miracle come forth, and so have the Discourses,etc. to: Expositions. Moreover, O Lord, there is equal value in theinnumerable Buddhas and Lords in countless world systems in all theten directions demonstrating Dharma, i.e. the Discourses, etc. to: Ex-positions with the help of the triple miracle, and in someone explainingthis perfection of wisdom in detail to others, after he has learned it.For the same reason as before. Moreover there is equal value in someonehonouring, revering, and worshipping all the countless Tathagataseverywhere, and in someone honouring, revering, and worshipping acopy of this perfection of wisdom. And why? Because from this perfectionof wisdom have the Tathagatas come forth.II 6,3,6.

Because that Bodhisattvais established on the irreversible level. And why? Because one wouldnot expect of someone who, having copied it out, learns this perfection ofwisdom, etc. to: worships it with flowers, etc. that he would be afraidanywhere. It is as with a man who, greatly frightened, waits on the king.If he manages (by his good service) to placate the king, he will be servedupon also by those of whom he was afraid, and will no longer fear them.And why? In the presence of a powerful support there can be no fear.It is just so that the relics of the Tathagata become an object of worshipas being saturated with the perfection of wisdom. In this context theperfection of wisdom corresponds to the king. As that man who issupported by the king becomes an object of worship, just so the relicsof the Tathagata become objects of worship because saturated with theperfection of wisdom. And also that cognition of the all-knowing shouldbe known as saturated with the perfection of wisdom. Therefore, ifconfronted with the two lots mentioned above I would choose just thisperfection of wisdom. And why? Because from it have come forth therelics of the Tathagata, as well as the 32 marks of a superman, the tenpowers of a Tathagata, etc. to: the 18 Buddhadharmas, the great friend-liness and the great compassion. As they have come forth from it dothe five perfections gain the appellation of 'perfection'. And also theall-knowledge of the Tathagata has come forth from it. Wherever in thegreat trichiliocosm beings take up this perfection of wisdom, etc. to:wisely attend to it, there humans and nonhumans who look or seek forentry to them do not gain entry; and all those beings will gradually movetowards Parinirvana. So great is the wonder-working power of thisperfection of wisdom! And this perfection of wisdom has been set upin this great trichiliocosm so that beings in it might do the work of aBuddha. One should expect a Buddha to appear in that world system inwhich the perfection of wisdom is observed. It is, O Lord, like a pricelessjewel which has the following properties: It prevents men and ghostsfrom entering the place where it is put. If someone were possessed by aghost, one has only to introduce this jewel, and that ghost would depart,unable to endure the splendour of that jewel. If someone's body wereburning with bile, one would only have to apply this jewel, and the bilewill be held back, could not get worse, and will be appeased. And thejewel would have the same effect when applied to a body oppressed bywind, choked with phlegm, or suffering from a disease resulting from adisorder of the humours. At night it would illuminate the scene. In theheat it would spread coolness, in the cold it would spread warmth,"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"P244   AA116   253and wherever it is placed the temperature will not be too hot or too cold,but just pleasant. Its presence drives vipers, scorpions, and crawlinganimals from districts which they have infested. If someone were bittenby a viper, he would only have to exhibit that jewel, and at its mere sightthat poison would depart. This is the kind of qualities which that jewelwould have. If those people who are vexed by various diseases will butplace that jewel on their bodies, then all those diseases will be appeased.Placed in water,it dyes that water all through with itsown colour. Wrappedin a blue cloth, and thrown into water, it makes the water blue. Equallywhen wrapped in a yellow cloth, or a red one, or a crimson one, or acrystal-coloured one, or one dyed in various hues. And it would alsocompletely clear up any turbidity there might be in the water. Endowedwith such and other qualities that jewel will be.Ānanda: Is this jewel a heavenly one, or can it be found among themen of Jambudvipa?Śakra : This is a heavenly jewel. The jewels of the men of Jambudvipaare rather small and coarse, but the heavenly ones are large and fine;they are as full of all possible qualities as the men of Jambudvipa arelacking in them. In fact the jewels of Jambudvipa are infinitely inferiorto the heavenly ones. If now that heavenly jewel were placed into abasket, then that basket would still remain an object of longing evenafter the jewel had been taken out of it, since one would remember thatthat jewel had been placed into it. Just so, in that place where this perfec-tion of wisdom has been observed, these physical or mental ills andtroubles, whether caused by humans or nonhumans, cannot affect thesons and daughters of good family. And 'great jewel' is a synonym forthe perfection of wisdom and the cognition of the all-knowing. Onecannot enumerate the qualities of the perfection of wisdom, for theyare innumerable. Innumerable are the qualities of the other perfections,etc. to: the Buddhadharmas, and so are those of the cognition of theall-knowing, of the Realm of Dharma, the fixed sequence of Dharma,of Suchness, of the Reality limit and of the unthinkable element.These qualities of the cognition of the all-knowing are the reasonswhy the relics of the Tathagata who has gone to Parinirvana become anobject of worship. These relics of the Tathagata are the true repositoriesof the cognition of the all-knowing, of the forsaking of all the defilementstogether with their residues, of the ability to always dwell in evenminded-ness and of the state of being always mindful, and that is the reason whythey become objects of worship.II 6,3,7.

Moreover,O Lord, if, on the one side not only the great trichiliocosm, but all thecountless world systems were filled to the very top with relics of theTathagata, and if on the other side I were offered a copy of the perfectionof wisdom, then of those two I would choose the perfection of wisdom.And why? Because from it have come forth the relics of the Tathagatawhich become objects of worship only because they are saturated withthe perfection of wisdom. If someone honours, reveres, and worshipsthe relics of the Tathagata, then as a result of his wholesome roots hewill experience pleasures open to both gods and men, and he will makean end of ill after having experienced pleasures in the families of warriors,Brahmins, and wealthy householders, and among the gods of the Fou/Great Kings, etc. to: the gods who control enjoyments magically createdby others. But if someone learns this perfection of wisdom, etc. to:wisely attends to it, then he can fulfill the perfection of meditation,etc. to : the perfection of giving, the 37 wings which lead to enlightenment,etc. to : the 18 special dharmas of a Buddha; he can transcend the levelsof a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, enter on a Bodhisattva's special wayof salvation, acquire the superknowledges of a Bodhisattva, pass onfrom Buddha-field to Buddha-field, and take up at will all kinds of personi-fications which enable him to mature beings, whether he appears as aworld ruler, or as a warrior, Brahmin, or wealthy householder. Therefore,O Lord, it is not that I lack in respect for the relics of the Tathagata,or that I do not want to be involved with them. But obviously it is becauseof the perfection of wisdom being honoured, revered, and worshippedthat the relics of the Tathagata are honoured, revered, and worshipped.Moreover, those who want to see both the Dharma-body and the physicalbodies of the Tathagatas who abide in countless world systems in all theten directions and demonstrate Dharma, should listen to this perfectionof wisdom, learn it, etc. to: wisely attend to it. If someone wants to seethose Tathagatas, he should, coursing in the perfection of wisdom,develop the recollection of the Buddha by way of two kinds of dharmas.Which are the two kinds of dharmas of the Buddhas and Lords? Theconditioned and the unconditioned Dharmahood. What then is Condi-tioned Dharmahood? The cognition of the 18 kinds of emptiness, of the37 dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment, etc. to: of the holyTruths, of the Unlimited, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas; and also thecognition of the wholesome roots, be they with or without outflows,faulty or faultless, worldly or supramundane, leading to defilement orpurification.

All the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,past, future, and present, owe their special forms of enlightenment to it,and thanks to it (the other holy men) at all times win the fruit of a Stream-winner, etc. to: Arhatship. And why? Because in this perfection ofwisdom the three vehicles are explained in detail, but by way of indicatingno sign, by way of nonproduction and nonstopping, nondefilementand nonpurification, by way of not affecting anything, not by way oftoiling or withdrawing from it, not by way of adding or subtractinganything, not by way of appropriation or nonappropriation—and inany case only by way of worldly convention and not as it is in ultimatereality. And why? Because in the perfection of wisdom one does notconceive of a not-beyond or a beyond, a shore or a gap (between twoshores), even or uneven, sign or signless, worldly or supramundane,conditioned or unconditioned, wholesome or unwholesome, past,future, or present. Nor does the perfection of wisdom bestow any dharma,also not the dharmas of Pratyekabuddhas or the dharmas which consti-tute Arhatship.II 6,3,9. STRONGLY STRONG.Śakra : A great perfection is this perfection of wisdom! For whenthe Bodhisattvas course in it, they can wisely know the thoughts anddoings of all beings, although they do not apprehend a being, a livingsoul, a personality, a man, a human, a young man, one who does, onewho feels, or one who sees. Nor do they apprehend form, etc. to: en-lightenment, or one who is enlightened, or the dharmas of a Buddha.For the perfection of wisdom has not been set up by taking anythingas a basis. And why? Because that own-being does not exist and cannotbe apprehended, nor that by which it could be apprehended, that whichcould be apprehended or that wherein it would be apprehended.The Lord : So it is, Kauśika, so it is. In this way the Bodhisattva whocourses in the perfection of wisdom by way of taking nothing for a basisdoes not even apprehend enlightenment, how much less the dharmas of aBuddha-to-be?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"256   ^4^4 II6-7  P 247-248Śakra : Does, then, the Bodhisattva course only in the perfection ofwisdom, and not in the other perfections?The Lord : The Bodhisattva courses in all the perfections, and notonly in the perfection of wisdom, but without taking anything as a basis.He does not apprehend the perfection of giving, a donor or recipient;not the perfection of morality, nor one of good conduct, nor immorality;not the perfection of patience, nor one who is patient, nor that whichhas to be endured; not the perfection of vigour, nor that which hasto be done, nor body and thought; not the perfection of meditation,nor thought, nor trance; not the perfection of wisdom, nor one whois wise or stupid. But it is the perfection of wisdom which directs andguides the Bodhisattva who gives gifts, guards his morality, developspatience, exerts vigour, enters into trance and has insight into dharmas,though without taking any dharma as a basis, from the skandhas tothe Buddhadharmas. The trees of Jambudvipa have different leavesand foliage, different flowers and fruits, different heights, shapes, andcircumferences, but with regard to the shadows cast by these trees nodistinction or difference can be apprehended; but they are all just called'shadows'. Just so no distinction or difference can be apprehendedbetween the five perfections, all of them upheld by the perfection ofwisdom and dedicated to all-knowledge—because of the absence ofa basis.II7.

When he considers this state of affairsthe Tathagata, having entered on the adamantine trance and havingmade his body also adamantine, generates the relics of a Tathagata outof his great compassion for the world of beings and leaves the Tathagata-relics for those beings who can be disciplined (?). And why? All thosewho after the Tathagata's Parinirvana worship a relic even as big as amustard seed produce a wholesome root of which the end cannot bereached until they themselves win Parinirvana.The Lord : So it is, Kauśika, so it is. The son or daughter of goodfamily who honours, etc., this perfection of wisdom, and gives a copyof it to someone else, begets the greater merit.117,1,2. MODERATELY WEAK.Moreover, someone will beget still greater merit if, having given toothers this perfection of wisdom as it has been explained, he will expoundit to them. One would expect him to have found the 'teacher', or a succes-sion of preceptors who represent him and who lead a spiritual life.And why? For this very perfection of wisdom should in this contextbe regarded as the 'teacher', nor is the teacher one thing and the perfectionof wisdom another, but just the perfection of wisdom is the teacher andjust the teacher is the perfection of wisdom. And why? Because thosewho have trained in this perfection of wisdom will appear in the worldas the Tathagatas of the past, future, and present. And also those Bodhi-sattvas who, in possession of the superknowledges and leading a spirituallife, have one after the other stood in irreversibility, have fully knownthe supreme enlightenment while training in this perfection of wisdom.In just this perfection of wisdom have the Disciples trained, and throughit the Arhats have attained Arhatship, the Pratyekabuddha the enlighten-ment of a Pratyekabuddha, and the Bodhisattvas have entered on theirspecial mode of salvation, enter on it, and will enter on it. Therefore,then, someone who wants face to face to honour, etc. the Tathagatasshould honour, etc. a copy of this perfection of wisdom. Consideringalso this state of affairs it occurred to Me when I had known full enlighten-ment: 'In dependence on which dharma should I now dwell, whichdharma should I honour, revere, and worship?' On perceiving that Ihad attained to the highest prominence (?) in the world with its gods,Brahmas and Maras, with its Shramanas and Brahmanas, it occurred tome: 'I will now honour, revere, and worship that dharma through"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"258   ,4,4 117  P249which I have been full enlightened, and I will dwell in reliance on thatdharma'. But that dharma, that is this perfection of wisdom. So I honour,revere, and worship this perfection of wisdom and, having done so,dwell in dependence on it.

(In his meditational development) he piles up all that (massof merit) and rejoices over it with the most excellent and sublime jubila-tion, the highest and utmost jubilation, with none above it, unequalled,equalling the unequalled. Having rejoiced he would make the wholesomeroot associated with the rejoicing common to all beings and dedicate itto their supreme enlightenment, with the words, 'may it feed the supremeenlightenment (of myself and of all beings)!'

Subhuti, the Bodhisattva is one who has coursedin the six perfections, who has honoured many Buddhas, who has plantedwholesome roots, who is upheld by good spiritual friends and who trainsin dharmas as empty of their own marks, then he is able to turn overinto the supreme enlightenment without having made into a sign thosefoundations and objects, those Buddhas and Lords, those wholesomeroots and those foundations of meritorious work associated with re-joicing. But he succeeds in turning over neither by way of duality nor byway of nonduality, not by way of sign nor by way of the signless, notby way of a basis nor by way of a nonbasis, not by way of defilement orby way of purification, not by way of production or by way of stopping.If, however, those Bodhisattvas have not coursed in the six perfections,have not honoured the Buddhas, have not planted wholesome roots,are not upheld by good spiritual friends and have not trained in dharmasas empty of their own marks, then they turn over into the supremeenlightenment while making those foundations and objects into signs,as well as those wholesome roots and those productions of thoughtassociated with rejoicing. But this perfection of wisdom expounded insuch a way, should not be taught in front of a Bodhisattva who has newlyset out in the vehicle. And so with the other perfections, and the eighteenkinds of emptiness. And why? For he would lose that little faith whichis his, that little serenity, affection, and respect which are his. In front ofan irreversible Bodhisattva, great being, should this be taught andexpounded, and also the other perfections and the eighteen kinds ofemptiness. When he has heard it, he will not tremble nor be frightenedor terrified—if he is one who has been taken hold of by the good friend.If he is upheld by the good friend, has done his duties under the Jinas ofthe past, has planted wholesome roots and honoured many Buddhas,then a Bodhisattva can turn over into the supreme enlightenment thefoundation of meritorious work associated with rejoicing.(Subhuti): That thought by which one has rejoiced and turned over,that thought is (at the time of turning over) extinct, stopped, departed,reversed, and so are those foundations and objects. What then is thethought associated with rejoicing, what the foundations and objects,and what the wholesome roots, which he turns over into the supremeenlightenment? What is the thought which he turns over, if two thoughtscan never meet and if the own-being of a thought cannot possibly beoverturned? But if a Bodhisattva, who courses in the perfection of"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"272   AA11%  P 261wisdom, cognizes thus, 'nonexistence is the perfection of wisdom, andso are the other perfections, so is form, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas',then the Bodhisattva succeeds in turning over into the supreme enlighten-ment the foundation of meritorious work associated with rejoicing.When he turns over in this way, then it becomes turned over into thesupreme enlightenment.Thereupon Maitreya, the Bodhisattva, the great being, said to Subhuti,the Elder: How do, by a son or daughter of good family who has newlyset out in the vehicle, these wholesome roots become turned over into fullenlightenment? And how do they become turned over after the foundationof meritorious action, which is connected with Rejoicing, has beenacquired?Subhuti: If, Maitreya, a Bodhisattva who, newly set out in the vehicle,courses in perfect wisdom, and grasps this perfection of wisdom withouttaking it as a basis or without treating it as a sign, then he has muchtrusting confidence in the perfections, the 18 kinds of emptiness, etc.to: the 18 special Buddhadharmas, he has been taken hold of by thegood friend—and these his good friends expound to him, according tothe meaning and the letter, just this perfection of wisdom and the otherperfections, and expound them to him in such a way that he becomesone who is not lacking in the perfection of wisdom, and in all the per-fections, etc. to: in the 18 special Buddhadharmas—he has entered onthe certainty that he will be saved by the special methods of a Bodhi-sattva, he will expound the deeds of Mara, and, when he has heard thedeeds of Mara, there will be in him neither growth nor diminution.And why? Because of these deeds of Mara no own-being is made manifest.And he will never be deprived of the Buddhas the Lords until the timethat he enters on a Bodhisattva's special mode of salvation. Thereafterhe will plant sufficient wholesome roots to enable him to obtain theBodhisattva-family, and he will no more be deprived of the Bodhisattva-family until the time that he fully knows the supreme enlightenment.Moreover, a Bodhisattva who has newly set out in the vehicle considersthe accumulations of merit of those Buddhas and Lords whose tracksare cut off, whose course is cut off, whose obstacles are cut off, who areguides through (the world of) becoming, whose tears have dried up,whose impediments are all crushed, whose own burdens are laid down,whose own weal has been reached, in whom the fetters of becoming areextinguished, whose thoughts are well freed by right understanding, andwho have attained to the highest perfection in the control of their entirehearts, as well as the accumulations of merit of the Tathagatas who abideit countless world systems in all the ten directions and demonstrateDharma, together with their congregations of Disciples; and also theaccumulations of merit of those who have planted wholesome roots"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"P261  /L4II8   273under them, or in the good families of warriors, etc. or among the variouskinds of gods—all these he piles up, rolls into one lump, and weighs up,and then rejoices over them with the most excellent and sublime jubilation,the highest and utmost jubilation, which has none above it; and, havingrejoiced at it, he should turn over into the supreme enlightenment thatwholesome root associated with the rejoicing.II 8,3. THE TURNING OVER MARKED BY THE ABSENCE OF PERVERTED VIEWS.Maitreya: If, Ven. Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who has newly set out inthe vehicle has brought to mind all the wholesome roots of those Buddhasand Lords, together with their congregations of Disciples, and if, afterhaving rejoiced over them with the best, etc. to: with the utmost jubilation,he turns them over into the supreme enlightenment, how is it that theBodhisattva does not have a perverted perception, perverted thought,or a perverted view?Subhuti: If, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva brings to mind those Buddhasand Lords, together with their congregations of Disciples, then he isnot one who perceives a Buddha, or a Disciple, or a wholesome root;but with regard to the thought by which he turns over he becomes inthat very thought one who perceives the thought (only); when he turnsover in this way, the Bodhisattva has no perverted perception, thought, orview. But if the Bodhisattva, having brought to mind those Buddhas andLords and those wholesome roots, makes them into a sign, and, havingmade them into a sign, turns them over into the supreme enlightenment,then this turning over amounts to a perverted perception, thought,and view. If again a Bodhisattva wisely knows those Buddhas and Lords,and those wholesome roots, and the thought by which he brings themto mind as 'just extinct, extinct'; and if he reflects that what is extinctthat cannot be turned over, and that this (extinction) is the very dharmicnature of the thought by which he turns over, as well as of that which heturns over and of that into which he turns over. If he turns over in thisway, then he turns over evenly and not unevently, not wrongly. It isthus that a Bodhisattva should turn over. The Bodhisattva considers(the accumulation of merit) of the past, future, and present Buddhas andLords, from their first production of the thought of enlightenment up totheir Parinirvana and further up to the vanishing of the good Dharma, aswell as the (accumulation of merit) of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas;and also the wholesome roots which as a result of hearing the demonstra-tion of Dharma have been planted by the common people, by the devas,Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras and Maho-ragas, by members of good warrior families, etc. to: by the gods up tothe gods of the Pure Abode;—all that he piles up, rolls into one lump,and weighs up, and, then, having rejoiced over it with the most excellent"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"274   ,4,4 118  P262and sublime jubilation, which has none above it, is unequalled, andequals the unequalled, he turns all this over into the supreme enlighten-ment. And if he again turns over while being aware that those dharmasare extinct, stopped, departed, reversed, and that that dharma also intowhich it (i.e. the wholesome root) is turned over is empty in its own-being,then it (i.e. the wholesome root) becomes something which has beenturned over into full enlightenment. And so it does if he turns over whileaware that dharmas cannot turn over dharmas, because all dharmas areempty in their own-being. It is thus that a Bodhisattva who courses in theperfection of wisdom and the other perfections is without pervertedperception, thought, or view. And why? Because he does not settle downin those turnings over, and, since he does not review those wholesomeroots and that thought of enlightenment, he cannot settle down in it.This is the supreme turning over of a Bodhisattva, a great being.II 8,4. THE ISOLATEDNESS OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN TURNING OVER.The accumulation of the foundations of meritorious work further-more becomes something which the Bodhisattva has turned over intofull enlightenment if he remains aware that this accumulation of thefoundations of meritorious work is isolated from the skandhas, elements,and sense fields, from the 37 dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment,etc. to: from the 18 special dharmas of a Buddha; and if furthermore heremains aware that the foundation of meritorious work associated withrejoicing is isolated in its own-being, that the Buddhas and Lords areisolated from the own-being of a Buddha, that also the wholesome rootsare isolated from the own-being of wholesome roots, the accumulationsfrom the own-being of the accumulations, the thought of enlightenmentfrom the own-being of the thought of enlightenment, the thought ofturning over from the own-being of turning over, enlightenment fromthe own-being of enlightenment, the perfection of wisdom from the own-being of the perfection of wisdom, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas areisolated from the own-being of the Buddhadharmas. It is thus that aBodhisattva should course in the isolated perfection of wisdom. This isthe perfection of wisdom of a Bodhisattva, a great being.II 8,5. MINDFUL RECOLLECTION OF THE OWN-BEING OF THE WHOLESOMEROOTS OF THE BUDDHAS.Moreover, a Bodhisattva should mindfully recollect all the wholesomeroots of those Buddhas and Lords and turn them over in such a waythat he is aware that such as that turning over so is that thought by whichone turns over; both are of the same kind, have the same own-being.When he remains aware of that, it (i.e. the wholesome root) becomessomething that has been turned over into full enlightenment. When he"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"P 263  AA II 8  275turns over in this way he is without perverted perception, thought, orview. If, however, the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom becomesaware of that wholesome root of those Buddhas and Lords by way of asign, then he does not succeed in turning it over into full enlightenment.And even if he brings to mind that the Buddhas and Lords of the pastwho have entered Parinirvana are without a sign and without an objectivesphere, and if he treats that as a sign, then he does not succeed in turningover those wholesome roots into full enlightenment, and he has pervertedperception, perverted thought, and perverted views. But if he does notperceive the Buddhas and Lords, nor those wholesome roots, nor thoseaccumulations, nor those productions of thought, and if he does notmake them into a sign, then the wholesome roots become something thathas been turned over into full enlightenment, and the Bodhisattva is thenwithout perverted perception, thought, or view.II 8,6. THE TURNING OVER IN ITS ASSOCIATION WITH SKILL IN MEANS.Maitreya: How, Rev. Subhuti, does the Bodhisattva turn overwithout making a sign?Subhuti: The Bodhisattva should train himself in the skill in meanscontained in this perfection of wisdom. For the Bodhisattva shouldknow about skill in means from this perfection of wisdom, and withoutresorting to the perfection of wisdom he cannot possible turn over thefoundation of meritorious work.Maitreya: One should surely not say, Ven. Subhuti, that thoseBuddhas and Lords do not exist in the perfection of wisdom, nor thosewholesome roots, nor those accumulations, nor those productions ofthought, etc. to: one should not say that one does not turn over intofull enlightenment?Subhuti: A Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom shouldconsider as follows: Stopped are those personal lives, those wholesomeroots, those accumulations and those productions of thought. But it isonly when one has made a sign that the Buddhas and Lords are discri-minated, as well as those wholesome roots, those accumulations, andthose productions of thought. And the Tathagatas withhold their sanctionfrom the rejoicing of someone who in this way turns over by way of a sign.And why? For this becomes to him a great basis that he makes into asign the Buddhas and Lords who have entered Parinirvana, that he dis-criminates and apprehends them.Therefore a Bodhisattva who wants to turn over the wholesome rootsshould not turn them over after having apprehend them and made theminto a sign, for the Tathagatas have not ascribed great wonderworkingpower to the turning over carried out by one who perceives a basis or asign. And why? Because that turning over is poisonous and thorny."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"276   v4^4 II 8  P 264II 8,7. THE TURNING OVER AS SIGNLESS.It is just as with food that seems excellent, but has been mixed with apoison which is concealed under its (apparently desirable) colour andtaste. Some foolish person might think that it should be eaten. Whenhe eats it, it appears good in its colour and taste, but its transformation(in someone who eats it) leads to a painful conclusion. Just so someonewho has badly seized (the teaching), badly distinguished it, and whobadly repeats it, and who neither knows its meaning nor understands it,will instruct others as follows: Come here, you son of good family, andconsider the wholesome roots which the Buddhas and Lords of the past,future, and present have effected in the interval between their first pro-duction of the thought of enlightenment, up to their achievement of thesupreme enlightenment, up to their entry into final Nirvana in the Nir-vana-element which leaves nothing behind, and up to the vanishing of thegood Dharma, by coursing in the perfection of wisdom and in the otherperfections; and also the wholesome roots associated with the fourtrances, etc. to: the 18 Buddhadharmas, through the accumulation ofwhich the Buddha-fields are purified and beings matured; and of thoseBuddhas and Lords the mass of morality, concentration, wisdom,emancipation, and the mass of the vision and cognition of emancipation,as well as their cognition of the knowledge of all modes, the cognitionof the state of being always mindful, the dwelling always in evenminded-ness; and also the wholesome roots effected by the Disciples and bythose predestined to Pratyekabuddhahood; and also the wholesomeroots effected by gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas,Kinnaras, and Mahoragas; and, then, having piled all these up, rolledthem into one lump, and weighed them up, turn them over into thesupreme enlightenment! Thus this turning over, since it is carried outby means of a sign and a basis, causes people to partake of poisonousness.It is just like the poisonous food mentioned before. There can be noturning over for one who perceives a basis. And why? For a basis ispoisonous (has a range), and is connected with signs, causes, and condi-tions. One who turns over in this way has not been well taught by theTathagata, he does not preach what the Tathagata has said, he does notpreach the Dharma. Followers of the Bodhisattva-vehicle should nottrain in this way.II 8,8. THE TURNING OVER AS ENJOINED BY THE BUDDHAS.Maitreya: How, then, should one turn over the wholesome roots ofthe past, future, and present Buddhas and Lords, after having rejoicedover them, from the production of their first thought of enlightenment,to their awakening to the supreme enlightenment, to the period whentheir good Dharma remains established, including their congregations"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"P265  ,4,4 118   277of Disciples, all the wholesome roots which they have effected duringthis interval, until they have attained all-knowledge, etc. to : how shouldone, after having rejoiced over them, turn over the wholesome rootsplanted by gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garudas,Mahoragas, humans and nonhumans? And how should one turn overso that those wholesome roots are actually turned over into the supremeenlightenment?Subhuti: Here a follower of the great vehicle, who courses in theperfection of wisdom and who does not want to calumniate the Tathagata,should turn over as follows: As the Tathagatas cognize with their unsur-passed Buddha-cognition those wholesome roots, their kind such as it is,their own-being such as it is, their marks such as they are, and as theyexist in their own dharmic nature, just so I rejoice, and as the Buddhasand Lords cognize it, so also I turn over into the supreme enlightenment.It is thus that a follower of the great vehicle should turn those wholesomeroots over into the supreme enlightenment. When he turns over in such away, he does not calumniate the Tathagatas, he preaches what theTathagata has said and he preaches Dharma. It is thus that the Bodhi-sattva's turning over becomes nonpoisonous.II 8,9. THE TURNING OVER IS UNINCLUDED IN WHAT BELONGS TO THETRIPLE WORLD.Furthermore, someone who has set out in the great vehicle and whocourses in the perfection of wisdom, should turn over those wholesomeroots while he realizes that form is unincluded in the world of sensedesire, the world of form and the formless world, and so are feelings,etc. to: conditioned coproduction, and so also the perfection of wisdomand the other perfections, and so Suchness, Dharmahood, the element ofDharma, the Reality limit and the unthinkable element, and so are aTathagata's morality, concentration, wisdom, emancipation, visionand cognition of emancipation, his knowledge of all modes, his state ofbeing always mindful, and his always dwelling in evenmindedness. Butwhat is unincluded that is not past, future, or present. And why? Becausejust as that is unincluded (in the triple world), so is also the turning over,and the dharmas which and into which one turns over, and he who turnsover, and also the Buddhas and Lords and their wholesome roots, andalso the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas and their wholesome roots.But what is unincluded that is not past, future, or present. If, however,the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom perceives that form, etc.to: the (Tathagata's) state of always dwelling in mindfulness are unin-cluded in the triple world, and that which is unincluded is not past,future, or present, he must remain aware that it is not possible to turnover these (dharmas) by way of a sign or a basis. And why? Because"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"278  ^118  P266a dharma's own-being does not exist; and that of which an own-beingdoes not exist is nonexistence; but it is impossible to turn over non-existence by way of nonexistence. It is thus that a Bodhisattva's turningover becomes nohpoisonous. If, however, a follower of the great vehicleturns over these wholesome roots by way of a sign and a basis, then heturns them over wrongly; but the Buddhas and Lords do not praise thewrong turning over as the right turning over. Such a one does not turnover with the turning over which the Buddhas and Lords praise; he doesnot turn over in the perfection of giving, etc. to: in the perfection ofwisdom; he thus will not fulfill the six perfections,, etc. to: the Buddha-dharmas, he will not fulfill the concentrations or the Dharani-doors; hewill not purify the Buddha-field or mature beings. But if he does notpurify the Buddha-field or mature beings, then he will not fully know thesupreme enlightenment. And why? Because his turning over is spoiledby poison. Moreover, the Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection ofwisdom should thus consider: 'As the Buddhas and Lords cognize it,through that Dharmahood should that wholesome root be turned over.Then it will actually and successfully be turned over. In this way I turnit over through this Dharmahood to the supreme enlightenment'.II 8,10. THE TURNING OVER AS GIVING RISE TO GREAT MERIT—WHICH ISWEAK.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well said, you who explain the mass ofturning over to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, by way of the signlessand baseless, by way of nonproduction and nonmanifestation, by way ofnondefilement and nonpurification, by way of nonexistence and of theemptiness of own-marks, by way of the Dharma-element, of Suchness, ofnonfalseness, of unaltered Suchness. If all the beings in the great trichi-liocosm were to become recipients of the ten ways of wholesome action,of the four trances, etc. to: of the five superknowledges, would they onthe strength of that beget much merit?Subhuti: They would, O Lord.The Lord: A merit greater than this would that son or daughter of goodfamily beget who would turn over the wholesome roots by a turningover which is without any stain. For such a turning over on the part of thatson or daughter of good family is proclaimed the most excellent of all.II 8,11. THE TURNING OVER AS GIVING RISE TO GREAT MERIT—WHICH ISMEDIUM.Moreover, Subhuti, if all the beings in the great trichiliocosm were tobecome Streamwinners, etc. to: Arhats, and if someone would duringhis entire life honour, revere, and worship them, with robes, etc. wouldhe on the strength of that beget much merit?"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"P 266-267  AAII8   279Subhuti: He would, O Lord.The Lord: Greater than his would be the merit of someone who wouldturn over the wholesome roots by a turning over which is without stain.Moreover, Subhuti, if all beings in the great trichiliocosm were to becomePratyekabuddhas, and if someone would during his entire life, honour,revere, and. worship them, with robes, etc. would he on the strength ofthat beget much merit?Subhuti: He would, O Lord.The Lord: Greater than his would be the merit of someone who wouldturn over wholesome roots by a turning over which is without stain.II 8,12. THE TURNING OVER AS GIVING RISE TO GREAT MERIT—WHICH ISSTRONG.Moreover, Subhuti, if all beings in this great trichiliocosm would set.out for the supreme enlightenment; and if in all the ten directions all thebeings in the countless world systems would for countless aeons honour,revere, and worship one single Bodhisattva with robes, etc. and furnishhim with all he might need—would those sons and daughters of goodfamily on the strength of that beget a great deal of merit?Subhuti: A great deal indeed, O Lord. That merit would in fact beinfinite. It would not be easy to find a comparison for this foundation ofmeritorious work. If that foundation of meritorious work were a materialthing, it would not find room even in all the world systems countless likethe sands of the Ganges.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well spoken was that which you havejust said. Greater than that would be the merit of someone who wouldthus turn over wholesome roots into the supreme enlightenment by aturning over which is without stain. Such a turning over of wholesomeroots is proclaimed as the most excellent of all. The mass of merit pre-viously mentioned will be infinitesimal compared with the mass of meritdue to the turning over which is without stain. And why? Because thosewho were endowed with the ten ways of wholesome action, the fourtrances, etc. to: the five superknowledges, were also perceivers of abasis. And so were those who honoured, revered, and worshipped, withrobes, etc. all those beings who had become Streamwinners, etc. to :Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas, and furnished them with all they mightneed. For this was only a matter of honouring, revering, and worshippingBodhisattvas who are based on something. Thereupon the Four GreatKings and twenty thousand gods belonging to their host paid homage tothe Lord with folded hands and said: A great transformation surely,O Lord, is this (turning over) by which the Bodhisattva, the great being,with his skill in means—in a manner which takes nothing as a basis,which is without stain, which is without a sign—turns over those whole-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"280   AAII8  P 267-268some roots into the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment, and turnsthem over in such a way that he approaches neither duality nor non-duality. Thereupon Śakra, Chief of Gods, together with (one hundredthousand) gods of the Thirty-three, worshipped the Lord with heavenlyflowers, incense, lamps, perfumes, wreaths, ointments, aromatic powders,garments, parasols, banners, and with music from heavenly musicalinstruments and cymbals. And they spoke as follows: A great trans-formation ... nonduality.Further again a Suyāma god, a Samtushita, a Nirmanarati, aParanirmitavaśavartin god, together with many hundreds of thousandsof deities said to the Lord: A great transformation ... non-duality.Thereupon many hundreds of thousands of kotis of niyutas of the Brahma-parshadi gods came to where the Lord was, saluted the Lord's feet withtheir heads, raised their voices, and uttered the following words: It iswonderful, O Lord, how much a Bodhisattva, a great being who hasbeen taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom and by skill in means,surpasses the wholesome roots of those previously mentioned Bodhi-sattvas and sons and daughters of good family who are based onsomething. And so spoke seventeen other classes of gods, up to theHighest Gods. Thereupon the Lord said to those gods, from the godsbelonging to the Four Great Kings up to the Highest Gods: If, O gods,all the beings in the great trichiliocosm had all set out for full enlighten-ment, and if they all, by way of taking something as a basis, would, afterthey had piled them up, and rejoiced at them, turn over into full enlighten-ment the following wholesome roots—i.e. those of the past, future, andpresent Tathagatas, Arhats, fully Enlightened Ones, with their congre-gations of Disciples, and with (their) Pratyekabuddhas—beginningwith the first thought of enlightenment, going on until the time whenthey have fully known the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment,going on until they have entered Parinirvana in the Nirvana-elementwhich leaves nothing behind, and up to the establishment of their goodDharma, i.e. the wholesome root (acquired by) those Buddhas andLords in that interval, and by those Disciples and by those Pratyeka-buddhas, and by all those beings different from them, the wholesomeroot which has issued from the perfection of giving, etc. to: the perfectionof wisdom—the mass of morality, the mass of concentration, the mass ofwisdom, the mass of emancipation, the mass of the cognition and visionof emancipation, and in addition the other measureless Buddhadharmas.And if on the other hand a son or daughter of good family has set out forfull enlightenment, and turns the above wholesome roots over into fullenlightenment, after he has piled them all up, heaped them up, weighedthem all up, and has rejoiced over them with the most excellent rejoicing,and (he turns over) in the manner of not taking anything as a basis, by"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"P 268-269  AA II Z-9   281way of nonduality, without a sign, without a stain, treating all dharmasas inactive. Then, that second son or daughter of good family begetsmuch more merit than the previously mentioned sons or daughters of goodfamily, and their wholesome root is incomparably superior to theirs.This turning over of the Bodhisattva which takes nothing as a basis is theone which is described as the most excellent, etc. to : as something quiteunsurpassed.119. Rejoicing.Subhuti: How is it that a jubilation becomes the most excellent, etc.to: something quite unsurpassed?The Lord: The jubilation of a Bodhisattva becomes the most excellent,etc. to: something quite unsurpassed when he does not seize upon orrelease the wholesome dharmas of the Tathagatas of the past, future, andpresent, together with their Pratyekabuddhas, and also the wholesomedharmas of all other beings, and if he does not mind them, not despisethem, not apprehend them; but if he thinks to himself that therein nodharma is produced or stopped, defiled or purified, and that of thosedharmas there is no diminution or growth, no coming or going, no heapand no nonexistence; and if he resolves to rejoice in accordance withthe Suchness, nonfalseness, and unaltered Suchness of those dharmas,with their dharmic nature, the established order of Dharma, and thefixed sequence of Dharma; and if after having rejoiced, he turns it overinto the supreme enlightenment. All other kinds of rejoicing are infinitelyinferior to this one, and by comparison with them this rejoicing is calledthe most excellent. Moreover, a son or daughter of good family who hasnewly set out in the vehicle and who wants to rejoice over the wholesomeroots of the past, future, and present Tathagatas, together with their Dis-ciples and the Pratyekabuddhas, acquired between the production of thefirst thought of enlightenment and the period when their Dharma remainsestablished, associated with the perfection of giving, etc. to: associatedwith the immeasurable Buddhadharmas; as well as over the wholesomeroots of all other beings, due to giving, morality, and meditationaldevelopment; he should rejoice as follows: As the resolve so the gift,the morality, etc. to: the wisdom; as the resolve, so form, etc.to: consciousness; as the resolve, so the elements, etc. to: the Buddha-dharmas ; as the resolve so the vision and cognition of emancipation;as the resolve so the rejoicing; as the resolve, so the past, future, andpresent Buddhadharmas; as the resolve, so the Buddhas and Lords; as theresolve, so the full enlightenment of those Buddhas and Lords; as theresolve, so the Parinirvana of those Buddhas and Lords; as the resolve,so the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas of those Buddhas and Lords; asthe resolve, so the Parinirvana of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas;"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"282   AA119  P 269-270as the resolve, so the Dharmahood of those Buddhas and Lords; as theresolve, so the Dharmahood of those Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas;as the resolve so is the Dharmahood of all dharmas and of all beingswho are unliberated (?), devoid of calm, undefiled, and unpurified,the Dharmahood of those dharmas which are unborn, unarisen, un-produced, and unstopped; in this way he turns over to the supremeenlightenment, although nothing passes on and nothing is destroyed.This is the most excellent rejoicing of the Bodhisattvas. When he isendowed with this rejoicing, the Bodhisattva quickly knows full enlighten-ment. Moreover, Subhuti, if some follower of the great vehicle shouldduring the whole of his life honour, revere, and worship, with robes, etc.those Buddhas and Lords, together with their congregations of Disciples,who abide in all the ten directions, in each single direction, in the worldsystems countless like the sands of the Ganges, and would give themeverything that they might need; and if day and night he would put forthzeal to honour, revere, and worship those Buddhas and Lords, withflowers, etc.; and if, by way of taking something as a basis he wouldstand in morality, develop patience, exert vigour, enter into trance anddevelop wisdom; and if on the other hand someone who has set out forthe supreme enlightenment, coursing in the six perfections withouttaking anything as a basis, turns these wholesome roots over into thesupreme enlightenment, then compared with his accumulation of meritand his accumulation of wholesome roots the previously mentionedaccumulation of merit is infinitesimally small. This is the turning overwhich is proclaimed as the most excellent, etc. to: as something quiteunsurpassed. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in the six per-fections, and who has rejoiced over those wholesome roots by way of skillin means and by way of taking nothing as a basis, should turn thesewholesome roots over into the supreme enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34GLORIFICATION OF THE VIRTUES OF CONSUMMATIONII10.

Just as,Kauśika, people born blind, one hundred, one thousand, or one hundredthousand of them, cannot, without a leader go along a road and muchless enter into a city; just so, Kauśika, without an eye the five perfectionsare as if born blind, without the perfection of wisdom they are unable toascend the path to enlightenment, and still less can they enter into thecity of the knowledge of all modes. When, however, the five perfectionshave been taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom, then they acquire anorgan of vision, and, taken hold of by the perfection of wisdom, thesefive perfections deserve to be called 'perfections'.Śakra: As the Rev. Śariputra has said, 'taken hold of by the perfectionof wisdom, the five perfections deserve to be called 'perfections'. Butthey do not deserve to be called 'perfections' because they are taken holdof by the perfection of giving, etc. to: by the perfection of meditation ?Śariputra: So it is, Kauśika, so it is. Therefore, then, this perfectionof wisdom has been proclaimed as superior to the other five perfections.II 10,3. THE NONEFFECTING OF ALL DHARMAS.Śariputra: How should, O Lord, the perfection of wisdom be con-summated?The Lord: Through the nonconsummation of form, etc. to: theBuddhadharmas. Through the nonconsummation of all dharmas, etc.to: through the nonconsummation of the knowledge of all modes.Śariputra: How should from the nonconsummation of form, etc.to : of the knowledge of all modes, the perfection of wisdom be consum-mated?The Lord: The perfection of wisdom should be consummated fromthe nonbringing-about of form, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes,from their nonproduction, nonstopping, nonexistence, no birth, non-destruction, and from their baselessness."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"P272   AA1110   285II 10,4. THE PROCURING OF REUNION BY NOT TAKING ALL DHARMAS AS ABASIS.Śariputra: What dharma does the perfection of wisdom procurewhen consummated in such a way?The Lord: None whatsoever. That is why it is styled 'perfection ofwisdom'.Śariputra : What dharma does it not procure?The Lord: No dharma which is wholesome or unwholesome, faulty orfaultless, with or without outflows, conditioned or unconditioned, defiledor purified, belonging to Samsara or to Nirvana. And why? Because theperfection of wisdom has not been set up for the sake of providing abasis. For that reason it procures no dharma.Śakra: Then, O Lord, does this perfection of wisdom not even procurethe knowledge of all modes?The Lord: The perfection of wisdom does not procure or apprehendany dharma, and therefore also not the knowledge of all modes.Śakra: How then, O Lord, does the perfection of wisdom not procureor apprehend the knowledge of all modes?The Lord: The perfection of wisdom does not procure or apprehendany dharma and therefore also not the knowledge of all modes.Śakra: How then, O Lord, does the perfection of wisdom not procureor apprehend the knowledge of all modes?The Lord: The perfection of wisdom does not procure it as if it were amental process, a sign, or a volitional act.Śakra: How then, again, does it procure?The Lord: To the extent that one does not approach anything, does notgrasp at anything, does not take one's stand on anything, does not forsakeanything, does not settle down in anything, to that extent one procures,i.e. to the extent that one does not procure any dharma, does not set itfree or acquire it. It is thus that one does not procure all dharmas, doesnot set them free, does not acquire them.Śakra: It is wonderful, O Lord, to see the extent to which thisperfection of wisdom has been set up for the nonproduction of alldharmas, for their nonstopping, their noneffecting, their nonapprehensionand their nondestruction.Subhuti: If, O Lord, the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdomshould perceive that 'the perfection of wisdom does not procure alldharmas', then he will treat the perfection of wisdom as worthless andkeep far away from it?The Lord: There is some way in which the Bodhisattva may treat theperfection of wisdom as worthless and keep away from it. If the Bodhi-sattva, coursing in the perfection of wisdom, perceives that 'this perfectionof wisdom is worthless, insignificant, unsubstantial and void', then he"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"286   AA11 10  P273will treat it as worthless and move far away from it.Subhuti: Which dharma become restored when the perfection ofwisdom has been restored?The Lord: Not form, etc. to: not the supreme enlightenment.Subhuti: How is it that when the perfection of wisdom has beenrestored no form, etc. to: no knowledge of all modes has been restored?The Lord: When form, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes are notapprehended, then the perfection of wisdom is restored.II 10,5. IT IS THAT WHICH BRINGS ABOUT THE GREAT AIM.Subhuti: A great perfection is this perfection of wisdom, O Lord!The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, in what manner is this per-fection of wisdom a great perfection?Subhuti: There is nothing that it makes great or small, that it extendsor contracts, that it strengthens or weakens. If, again, a Bodhisattva whohas newly set out in this vehicle, perceives because of the perfection ofwisdom, etc. to: because of the perfection of giving that 'the perfectionof wisdom makes nothing great or small, nor does it strengthen or weakenanything', then, when he thus perceives, the Bodhisattva does not coursein the perfection of wisdom. And why? Because that cannot be an out-come of the perfection of wisdom. It is not an outcome of the perfectionof wisdom that form, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas are made large orsmall. And why? Because Bodhisattvas do not perceive a basis. Thus theperfection of wisdom should be seen from the no-birth of beings. Fromthe no-birth of form, etc. to: the Buddha should the no-birth of theperfection of wisdom be seen. One should see that the perfection ofwisdom has no own-being, because beings, as well as form, etc. to: theBuddhas have no own-being. One should know the nonexistence of theperfection of wisdom, its emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness fromthe fact that beings as well as form, etc. to: the Buddhas are nonexistent,empty, signless, and wishless. One should know the nonbeingness of theperfection of wisdom, its unthinkability, and indestructibility from thefact that beings are nonbeings, unthinkable, and indestructible. Oneshould know that the perfection of wisdom does not actually undergothe process which leads to enlightenment because beings do not, nor doesform, etc. do so. One should know that 'the perfection of wisdom is notendowed with the powers because beings are not endowed with the powers,and because form, etc. to: the Buddhas are not endowed with the powers'.In this manner also is the perfection of wisdom a great perfection for theBodhisattvas, the great beings."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35THE HELLSII11.

When the deep perfection of wisdom is being taught to them,they lack in faith, and walk out (of the assembly). In their lack of respectthese sons and daughters of good family even walk away when theBuddhas and Lords teach this deep perfection of wisdom. Even herethere are assembled sons and daughters of good family, belonging to thegreat vehicle, who, when the deep perfection of wisdom is being taught,will walk away. And why? Because in the past also when the deep per-fection of wisdom was being taught, they have walked away, therefore,also just now they walk away when the deep perfection of wisdom isbeing taught. There is no concord either in their bodies or their thoughts,and they will heap up a karma conducive to weakness in wisdom. Havingdone and heaped up this karma conducive to weakness in wisdom, theywill refuse this deep perfection of wisdom when it is being taught, and bythis refusal they will refuse the all-knowledge of the past, future, andpresent Buddhas and Lords. By this rejection of all-knowledge, and byhaving done and heaped up karma conducive to the ruin of Dharma,they will be hurled for many thousands of niyutas of kotis of years intothe great hells.

When they are rebornin these great hells, they will experience many sharp pains, and that untilthe time that this world system is once more destroyed. When that destruc-tion has taken place, they will again, having deceased here, be reborn inother world systems in the great hells. Thereafter they will in all the tendirections be reborn as animals. Then they will, reborn in the ten directionsin the world of Yama, experience very painful feelings there, and therebythey will exhaust that karma. Having exhausted the karma which led to somany painful feelings, they will somewhere and at some time acquire ahuman body, and wherever they may be reborn they will be born blind, orbe reborn among born-blind families, or in the families of outcasts, orrefuse workers, or among keepers of oxen, hogs, or ..., or in familieswhich are mean, contemptible and low-class.

Just here there will bedeluded persons who have left the world for the well-taught Dharma-Vinaya, and who will decide to defame and oppose this perfection ofwisdom.

Which four? These deluded men are (1) under theinfluence of Mara, (2) they are unpractised in deep dharmas, and haveno serene confidence (in them), (3) they have settled down in the fiveskandhas, and (4) they have fallen into the hands of bad spiritual directors,practise in faulty ways, exalt themselves, and depreciate others. Endowedwith these four modes those deluded men will reject the deep perfectionof wisdom.Subhuti: It is hard to gain confidence in the deep perfection of wisdomfor one who is unpractised, lacks in wholesome roots, and is in thehands of a bad spiritual advisor.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti.Subhuti: How deep then, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom, sinceit is so hard to gain confidence in it?The Lord: Form, etc. is neither bound nor freed, because form, etc.is without the own-being of form, etc. The past starting point of form,etc. is neither bound nor freed, because it has nonexistence for its own-being. The future end of form, etc. is neither bound nor freed, becauseit has nonexistence for its own-being.

Farness (from Perfect Wisdom) owing to Lack of Skill in Means.Subhuti: If again, O Lord, a son or daughter of good family whobelongs to the great vehicle would, unskilled in means, cognize theperfection of wisdom by making it into a basis, he will (thereby) partfrom this perfection of wisdom and get far away from it.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well said; so it is, Subhuti. For alsonames and signs are sources of attachment. And why? Because all dharmasare signless and nameless.Subhuti: How, O Lord, are also names and signs sources of attach-ment?The Lord: Here, Subhuti, a son or daughter of good family whobelongs to the great vehicle seizes on the perfection of wisdom througha name, seizes on it through a sign. And, having seized on it through asign and a name they will part from the perfection of wisdom, will getfar away from it; by minding it they will part from the perfection ofwisdom, will get far away from it.Ill 4. Nearness (to Perfect Wisdom) owing to Skill in Means.Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, to see the extent to which thisperfection of wisdom of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, has beenwell taught, and well rounded off.Ill 5. (The Cognition of) Entities (as a Point to be Shunned).Śāriputra: What, Ven. Subhuti, is attachment on the part of the"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"P 285   AA III 5-6   299Bodhisattvas who course in perfect wisdom, and what is nonattachment?Subhuti: Here, Ven. Śariputra, a Bodhisattva, or a son or daughterof good family, unskilled in means will perceive the skandhas as empty—and that is an attachment; unskilled in means he will perceive pastdharmas as past dharmas, future dharmas as future dharmas, presentdharmas as present dharmas—and that is an attachment. Moreover,it is an attachment if a Bodhisattva, while perceiving a basis, courses,beginning with the first thought of enlightenment, in the six perfections.Ill 6. Points to be Shunned and Antidotes.Ill 6,ab. ANTIDOTES (AND POINTS TO BE SHUNNED).As again, Ven. Śariputra, you have said, 'What is the nonattachmentof the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, who course in perfect wisdom?'The Bodhisattva, the great being, who courses in perfect wisdom andwho is skilled in means does certainly not perceive form as form, feelingas feeling, etc.; not past dharmas as past dharmas, etc. Nor does itoccur to him: I give a gift, to him I give a gift, this gift I give; I guardmorality, this morality I guard, through that do I guard morality; etc.to: I beget merit, thus I beget (merit). I enter on the Bodhisattva's cer-tainty of salvation; I will purify the Buddha-field; I will mature beings;I shall reach all-knowledge. The Bodhisattvas who course in perfectwisdom and are skilled in means do not make any of these discrimina-tions. And why? On account of the twenty kinds of emptiness. These arethe nonattachments of a Bodhisattva, a great being, who courses inperfect wisdom and who is skilled in means.Ill 6c. ONCE MORE THE POINTS TO BE SHUNNED.Śakra: In which manner, Subhuti, is there attachment on the partof a Bodhisattva?Subhuti: Here, Kauśika, the Bodhisattva perceives thought, perceivesgiving, etc. to: wisdom, the 20 kinds of emptiness, perceives the Buddhas,the Lords. He perceives the wholesome roots which have been plantedunder the Buddhas, and after he has heaped up all these, rolled theminto one lump, and weighed them up, he converts them into the utmost,right, and perfect enlightenment. This is an attachment on the part of aBodhisattva, and through it he does not course in nonattachment.And why? For it is impossible to turn over the essential original natureof form, feeling, etc.Ill 6d. ONCE MORE THE ANTIDOTE.Moreover, Kauśika, a Bodhisattva who wants to instruct othersin the supreme enlightenment, who wants to instigate them, fill them with"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"300  AA III 6  P 286enthusiasm for it, encourage them towards it, he should do so with amind which keeps in agreement with true reality, and also in such a waythat, when he courses in perfect wisdom, he does not produce suchdiscursive ideas as 'I give a gift', etc. It is thus that a Bodhisattva rousesand incites others. In that way he does not cast his self away, and themanner in which he rouses others has the sanction of the Buddhas. It isthus that a Bodhisattva should rouse and incite to the supreme enligh-tenment. And it is in this way that that son or daughter of good familysucceeds in abandoning all the points of attachment.Ill 6e. SUBTLE ATTACHMENTS.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, you who point out to the Bodhisattvas,the great beings, these points of attachment. I will now announce toyou other, more subtle, attachments. Listen to them well, and pay goodattention! I will teach them to you. \"So be it, O Lord!\" and the Ven.Subhuti listened in silence.The Lord: Here, Subhuti, a son or daughter of good family whohas set out for the supreme enlightenment attends to the Tathagatasthrough a sign. But, so many signs, so many attachments. Whateverwholesome root there may be on the part of those Tathagatas in theinterval (of time) which begins with the first thought of enlightenment,until full enlightenment has been fully known, until they have reachedfinal Nirvana in the Nirvana-element which leaves nothing behind,and until the establishment of the Good Law,—to all that he attendsthrough a sign, and, having attended to it, dedicates it to the supremeenlightenment. But as long as he attends through a sign, so long there isattachment. And as to the wholesome roots, which are quite free fromattachment, of those Tathagatas, who are themselves free from allattachment, and as to the wholesome roots of other beings as well—tothose also he attends through a sign, and, having attended to them, hededicates them to the supreme enlightenment. But as long as he attendsthrough a sign, so long there is attachment. And why? For the Tathagatasshould not be attended to through a sign, nor should the wholesome rootsof those others be attended to through a sign.Ill 6f. THE DEPTH OF DHARMA.Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: Because all dharmas are isolated in their essential originalnature.Subhuti: I pay homage, O Lord, to the perfection of wisdom!The Lord: For the perfection of wisdom is unmade, it has not beenbrought about, and so it has not been fully known by anyone."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"P 286  AA III 6  301III 6g. THE ABANDONMENT OF ALL ATTACHMENTS.Subhuti: Hard to know fully are all dharmas.The Lord: Because they have the essential nature of Buddhadharmas.Their nature is a no-nature. May a Bodhisattva thus cognize and see theessential nature as a no-nature which has not been brought about. Allpoints of attachment will then be abandoned.Ill 6h. THE FACT THAT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.Subhuti: Hard to know fully, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom!The Lord: Because the perfection of wisdom has not been seen byanyone, nor heard, nor felt, nor discerned, nor fully known.Ill 6i.

The Endeavours of the Cognition of Entities.Ill 7,1. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO THE SKANDHAS.Subhuti: How, O Lord, should a Bodhisattva course in perfectwisdom?The Lord: Here, Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, does not course in form, etc., then he courses in perfect wisdom.HI 7,2. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO THE IMPERMANENCE, ETC.OF THE SKANDHAS.If he does not course in the idea that 'form is not permanent or imper-manent', 'not ease or ill', etc. then he courses in perfect wisdom. And why?That form does not exist in such a way that impermanent or permanent,ease or ill, self or not-self, attractive or repulsive (can be predicated) ofit; and so for feeling, etc.HI 7,3. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO THE COMPLETENESS OR IN-COMPLETENESS OF THE SKANDHAS.Moreover, if a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does notcourse in the idea that 'form, etc. is incomplete or complete', then hecourses in perfect wisdom. And why? For what is the incompleteness orcompleteness of form, etc. to: all-knowledge, that is not form, etc. to :all-knowledge. If also thus he does not course, then he courses in perfectwisdom.Ill 7,4. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO NONATTACHMENT TO THESKANDHAS.Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, to what an extent both the attachmentand the nonattachment of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, have beenexplained!The Lord: So it is, Subhuti. They have been well explained by theTathagata, the Arhat, the fully enlightened Buddha. Moreover, Subhuti,"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"P 288-289  AA III 7  303if a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does not course in theidea that 'form is with attachment or without attachment', then he coursesin perfect wisdom. Coursing thus, the Bodhisattva, the great being, doesnot perceive form, etc., as 'with or without attachment'.Ill 7,5. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO THE IMMUTABILITY (OF PERFECTWISDOM).Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, how demonstration does notdiminish this deep perfection of wisdom, nor does nondemonstrationdiminish it; demonstration does not increase it, and also nondemonstra-tion does not increase it.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, nondemonstration of the perfection ofwisdom does not diminish, demonstration does not increase it. It is as if aTathagata should, during his entire life, speak in praise or dispraise ofspace—and yet the volume of space would not increase when he praisesit and would not diminish when he does not praise it. For space does notincrease through praise, nor does it diminish through nonpraise.Ill 7,6. THE ENDEAVOURS WITH REGARD TO THE ABSENCE OF AN AGENT.Or it is as with an illusory man. Praise does not make him grow, nordoes he waste away when there is no praise. Praise does not win him over,and when there is no praise he is not frustrated. Just so the true nature ofdharmas is just as much as it is, whether it be demonstrated or not.Ill 7,7. THE ENDEAVOUR TO DO THAT WHICH IS HARD TO DO.Ill 7,7a. THE ULTIMATE AIM IS HARD TO REALIZE.Subhuti: A doer of what is hard is the Bodhisattva who, while coursingin perfect wisdom, does not lose heart when the perfection of wisdomis being preached, and does not mentally turn away from it, who persistsin making endeavours about the perfection of wisdom and who does notturn back on the supreme enlightenment. And why? This development ofperfect wisdom is like the development of space. But in space there canbe no development of perfect wisdom and the perfection of wisdom cannotbe conceived in space, nor the other perfections, nor the skandhas, etc.to: nor the supreme enlightenment.Subhuti: I pay homage to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, who arearmed with this armour. Those who for the sake of beings put on thearmour want to exert themselves and to struggle for the sake of space,and they want to liberate space. Armed with the great armour are theBodhisattvas who put on the armour for the sake of dharmas which arelike space."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"304   AA III 7  P 289-290III 7,7b. THE TRAINING IS DIFFICULT.They want to get rid of space or the firmanent, those who for the sakeof beings put on the armour.Ill 7,7c. THE ACTIVITY IS DIFFICULT.A great perfection of vigour has the Bodhisattva who wants to know thesupreme enlightenment for the sake of beings. And why? If this greattrichiliocosm were quite full of Tathagatas, like a thicket of reeds, abamboo wood, a sugar cane forest, a forest of Saccharum Sara reed orlike a rice field, and if these Tathagatas would demonstrate Dharma for anaeon or for the remainder of an aeon; and if each single Tathagata wouldlead countless beings to Nirvana; still one could not conceive of thedepletion or repletion of the world of beings. And why? On account of theunreality of beings, on account of their isolatedness. And the same wouldbe true if all the world systems in all the ten directions were considered.It is by way of this method that I say: Space would those want to liberatewho for the sake of beings want to know full enlightenment.Ill 7,8. THE ENDEAVOUR IS NOT BARREN.Thereupon, it occurred to a certain monk: I pay homage, O Lord, tothe perfection of wisdom of the Lord, in which no dharma is either pro-duced or stopped. The mass of morality is not conceived in it, the mass ofconcentration, etc. to: the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. is not conceivedin it.Śakra: If, Ven. Subhuti, a Bodhisattva were to make endeavoursabout this deep perfection of wisdom, what would his endeavours beabout?Subhuti: About space he would make endeavours, if he wouldendeavour to train in this deep perfection of wisdom.Ill 7,9. THE ENDEAVOUR IS NOT CONDITIONED BY ANYONE ELSE.Śakra: I will arrange for the shelter, defense, and protection of thatson or daughter of good family who will take up, etc. this perfection ofwisdom.Subhuti: Can you, Śakra, see that dharma which you wish to shelter,defend, and protect?Śakra: No, I cannot.Subhuti: When a son or daughter of good family stand in perfectwisdom as it has been expounded, then just that will be their shelter,defense, and protection. On the other hand, when they are lacking in theperfection of wisdom as it has been expounded, then (hostile) men andghosts will get a chance to harm them.

What do you think, Kauśika, are you able to arrange shelter,defense, and protection for a magical illusion, a mirage, a dream, an echo,a reflection, an image, a city of the Gandharvas?Śakra: Not so, Ven. Subhuti.Subhuti: So it is, Kauśika, One who would think of arranging shelter,defense, and protection for Bodhisattvas who course in perfect wisdomwould wear himself out to no purpose. What do you think, Kauśika, areyou able to arrange shelter, defense, and protection for a Tathagata, orfor a Tathagata's magical creation?Śakra: Not so, Ven. Subhuti.Subhuti: So it is, Kauśika. One who would think of arranging shelter,defense, and protection for Bodhisattvas who course in perfect wisdomwould wear himself out to no purpose. What do you think, Kauśika, areyou able to arrange shelter, defense and protection for the Dharma-element, for the Reality limit, for Suchness, for the unthinkable element?Śakra: Not so, Ven. Subhuti.Subhuti: Just so with the Bodhisattvas.1117,10. THE COGNITION OF THE SEVEN ASPECTS (OR POINTS OF) COM-PARISON.Śakra: To what an extent has a Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom comprehended all dharmas as like a dream, a mock show, amirage, an echo, a reflected image, a city of the Gandharvas, an illusorymagical creation?Subhuti: To the extent that Bodhisattvas do not put their minds evento the dream, or do not mind through the dream, or do not think that'this is my dream', or do not mind in the dream—and so for the othersix—to that extent have they comprehended that all dharmas are like adream, etc.Ill 8. The Sameness of the Endeavours.Moreover, Kauśika, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom doesnot put his mind even to form, does not mind through form, does notmind in a dream, does not think 'mine is the dream', does not think 'thisis a dream'; and so on with the usual variations.Ill 9. The Path of Vision.Ill 9a.

INDICATION THAT THE THIRD TOPIC, THAT OF THE KNOWLEDGEOF ALL MODES, IS CONCLUDED.And again, Subhuti, this perfection of wisdom does not bestow theBuddhadharmas nor take them away; and so for the dharmas of thefoolish common people, the dharmas of the Disciples and Pratyekabud-dhas, and the Buddhadharmas; and so for the conditioned element andthe unconditioned element. And why? Whether Tathagatas are produced(in the world) or are nor produced, fixed is this Dharmahood of dharmas,the Dharma-element, the fixedness of Dharma, the fixed sequence ofdharma(s). Those the Tathagata fully knows, and realizes intuitively.Having fully known them and having realized them intuitively, he des-cribes them, demonstrates them, uncovers them, analyzes them, enlargeson them, and reveals them.Thereupon a great many hundreds of thousands of gods who stood uphigh in the intermediate space called out aloud with cries of joy, wavedtheir garments, and hurled heavenly blue, red, and white lotuses andmandarava flowers (into the air). And they said, \"Now, indeed, we seethe second turning of the wheel of Dharma taking place in Jambudvipa!\"And when the perfection of wisdom was being expounded, many thou-sands of gods acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to beproduced.The Lord: This is not, Subhuti, the second turning of the wheel ofDharma, nor the first. Nor has this perfection of wisdom been set up forthe sake of turning forward any dharma, or of turning it backward—onaccount of the emptiness of the nonexistence of own-being.Subhuti: What, O Lord, is the emptiness of the nonexistence of own-being, in consequence of which this perfection of wisdom has not beenset up for the sake of turning any dharma forward or backward?"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"P 295-296  A A III 10   311The Lord: The perfection of wisdom is empty of the perfection ofwisdom; and so is the perfection of meditation empty of the perfection ofmeditation; etc.Subhuti: A great perfection for the Bodhisattvas, the great beings,O Lord, is this perfection of wisdom. For the own-being of all dharmasis empty of the own-being of all dharmas. It is thanks to the perfection ofwisdom that the Bodhisattvas, the great beings know full enlightenment,although they do not fully know any dharma. They turn the wheel ofDharma, but they do not turn any dharma forward or backward. Theydo not behold any dharma, nor do they demonstrate any dharma. Andwhy? Because that dharma cannot be apprehended which could turnforward or backward. For one absolutely does not settle down in alldharmas. And why? Because emptiness does not proceed or recede, nordoes the Signless or Wishless. To demonstrate that is the proclamationof the perfection of wisdom, its narration, its disclosure, its dispatching,its explanation, its analysis, its indication, its amplification, its revelation.This is the perfectly pure demonstration of the perfection of wisdom.No one has demonstrated it, no one has received it, no one has realised it.And since no one has realised it, no one has therein gone to final Nirvana.Nor has this demonstration of Dharma ever made anyone worthy ofgifts."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38WITHOUT BASISIV.

Endeavours.IV2,A. FOUR ASPECTS OF THE PERSON WHO IS SUITABLE TO MAKE THEENDEAVOURS.Thereupon it occurred to Śakra, Chief of Gods: Those sons anddaughters of good family who come to hear this perfection of wisdommust have fulfilled their duties under the Jinas of the past, must haveplanted wholesome roots under (those) Tathagatas and must have beentaken hold of by good spiritual friends. How much more so those whotake it up, bear it in mind, preach and study it, wisely attend to it, and who,in addition, progress to Thusness. They must have honoured manyBuddhas if, on hearing this perfection of wisdom, they take it up, etc.to: progress to Thusness. They must have questioned the Tathagatas ofthe past again and again, must have tended, loved and honoured them,if, on hearing this perfection of wisdom, they do not tremble, are notfrightened or terrified. Under many kotis of Buddhas they must havecoursed in the six perfections if, on hearing this perfection of wisdom,they do not tremble, are not frightened or terrified.Śāriputra: Those sons and daughters of good family, O Lord, who,having heard this deep perfection of wisdom, will not tremble, be frighte-ned or terrified, but will take it up, bear it in mind, recite and study it,and wisely attend to it, as irreversible Bodhisattvas, great beings, shouldthese sons and daughters of good family be borne in mind. And why?Because the perfection of wisdom is deep, and therefore someone whohas not in the past practised the six perfections cannot believe in it. Butagain those who now decide to reject this deep perfection of wisdom,they have also rejected it in the past. And that is the reason why withregard to this deep perfection of wisdom they have no faith, no sereneconfidence, no affection, and no resolve. And those sons and daughtersof good family have not repeatedly questioned the Buddhas, the Bodhi-sattvas, the Pratyekabuddhas, or Disciples as to how the six perfectionsshould be practised, or as to how the emptinesses etc. to: the Buddha-dharmas should be developed.Śakra: Deep, Ven. Śariputra, is the perfection of wisdom! It is not atall astonishing that Bodhisattvas who in the past did not believe in this"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"P 301-302  AAIV 2   319deep perfection of wisdom, or in the perfection of giving, etc. to: theBuddhadharmas, should now reject it. There is nothing astonishingabout that. I pay homage to the Blessed Perfection of Wisdom! Onepays homage to the cognition of the all-knowing when one pays homageto the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: So it is. For from it has come forth the knowledge of allmodes of the Buddhas, the Lords, and, conversely, the perfection ofwisdom is brought about as something which has come forth from theknowledge of all modes. A son or daughter of good family should standin the perfection of wisdom, if they want to transcend all-knowledge, tostand in the knowledge of the paths, to produce the knowledge of allmodes, to uproot all the defilements and their residues, to fully know thesupreme enlightenment and to turn the wheel of Dharma. Likewise, if aBodhisattva wants to establish beings in the fruit of a Stream winner, or inthe enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha, or in the supreme enlightenment,or if he wants to foster the order of monks, he should make endeavoursabout this perfection of wisdom.Śakra: How does a Bodhisattva become established in the six per-fections, and how does he make endeavours about them? And how,coursing in the perfection of wisdom, does he make endeavours about theemptinesses, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas?The Lord: Well said, Kauśika, well said. It is good that you havedecided to question the Tathagata about this matter. In that also youhave been inspired by the Buddha's might. Therefore then, Kauśika,listen and attend well, I will explain this to you.IV2B. THE METHODS OF TRAINING.IV2B, 1. THE METHOD OF TRAINING WHICH DOES NOT INSIST ON THE REALITYOF THE SKANDHAS.Here, Kauśika, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does notstand in form, etc. and in consequence makes no endeavour about form,etc. It is thus that he makes endeavours about the perfection of wisdom.And why? Because he does not apprehend that form, etc. wherein hecould abide, or whereabout he could make endeavours.IV2B,2. THE METHOD OF TRAINING WHICH IS WITHOUT EFFORT.Moreover the Bodhisattva does not apply himself to form, etc.; it isthus that he makes endeavours about them. And why? Because he does notapprehend form, etc. where it begins, or where it ends, or in its middleeither.IV2B,3. THE METHOD OF TRAINING WHICH IS DEEP.Śāriputra: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"320   AAIV 2  P 302-303The Lord: Through the depth of the Suchness of form; so with feeling,etc.IV2B,4.

(+3 subdivisions).Śāriputra: Unlimited is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: Because form is unlimited; so with feeling, etc. to: theBuddhadharmas.Śāriputra' How does the Bodhisattva course in the perfection ofwisdom?The Lord: If the Bodhisattva, when he courses in perfect wisdom doesnot course in the notion that 'form, etc. is deep'. And why? The depth ofform is not form; and so with feeling, etc. And again, Śariputra, if theBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, does not course in thenotion that 'form, etc. is hard to fathom', then he courses in the perfectionof wisdom. And why? Because the unfathomability of form is not form;and so with feeling, etc. Moreover, if the Bodhisattva, when he courses inperfect wisdom, does not course in the notion that 'form, etc., is unli-mited', then he courses in the perfection of wisdom. And why? Theunlimitedness of form, that is not form; and so with feeling, etc.IV2B,6. UNDERSTANDING IS ATTAINED PAINFULLY AND SLOWLY.Śāriputra: So deep is this perfection of wisdom, so hard to fathom,so hard to understand, so unlimited that it should not be taught in frontof Bodhisattvas who have newly set out in the vehicle. May they not,when they hear this deep perfection of wisdom, tremble, be frightened,be terrified! In front of an irreversible Bodhisattva should it be taught!When he has heard this perfection of wisdom, he will not tremble, befrightened or terrified, he will not hesitate or doubt, and he will resolutelybelieve in it when he hears it.Śakra: If, Rev. Śariputra, this deep perfection of wisdom were taughtin front of a Bodhisattva who has newly set out in the vehicle, what faultwould there be?Śāriputra : If, Kauśika, this perfection of wisdom were taught in frontof a Bodhisattva who has newly set out in the vehicle, he would tremble,be frightened and terrified, and it is quite possible that he may be put off,may reject it, may not believe in it. And if that Bodhisattva who hasnewly set out in the vehicle should, on hearing it, reject this deep perfectionof wisdom, then he would heap up a karma which leads him into an evildestiny and he would awake to full enlightenment only with much troubleand slowly."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"P 303-304  AAIV 2   321IV2B,7. THE METHOD OF TRAINING CONNECTED WITH THE GAINING OFTHE PREDICTION.Śakra: Are there, then, Ven. Śariputra, Bodhisattvas who are stillunpredicted, and who, on hearing this perfection of wisdom, will nottremble, be frightened or terrified?Śāriputra: Those who, on hearing this perfection of wisdom, will nottremble, be frightened or terrified, before long will gain the prediction tofull enlightenment. Before they have passed by one, or two, or threeTathagatas, they will gain the prediction to full enlightenment.The Lord: So it is, Śariputra, so it is. Set out for long in the vehicle willbe those Bodhisattvas, for long will they have coursed in the six perfec-tions, many Buddhas will they have honoured if, on hearing this deepperfection of wisdom, they will not tremble, be frightened or terrified,and if, after having heard it, they will take it up, bear it in mind, recite andstudy it, and will stand in the perfection of wisdom as it has been explained.Śāriputra: It has become clear to me, O Lord, it has become clear tome, O Well-Gone!The Lord: Make it clear then, Śariputra.Śāriputra: If in a dream a son or daughter of good family who hasset out in the great vehicle were to develop the perfection of wisdom andthe other perfections, etc. to: were to sit on the terrace of enlightenment,then one should know that he is actually near to the supreme enligh-tenment. How much more will one who, while awake, develops the sixperfections be quite near to the supreme enlightenment!IV2B,8. IRREVERSIBILITY.Those sons and daughters of good family who come to hear of thisdeep perfection of wisdom, and who, on hearing it, progress in it, havematured their wholesome roots for a long time. They will have set outfor a long time in the vehicle, will have planted wholesome roots, havehonoured many Buddhas, will have been taken hold of by the goodspiritual friends if, after having heard this deep perfection of wisdom,they will take it up, bear it in mind, recite and study it, and wisely attend toit. They will be quite near to the supreme enlightenment and will receivethe prediction to it (?). Or those will be irreversible from the supremeenlightenment to whom this perfection of wisdom appears on its ownaccord, and who then take it up, bear it in mind, recite and study it, andwisely attend to it.IV2B,9. DEFINITE GOING FORTH.A man coming out of a huge wild forest, one hundred up to fivehundred miles big, might see certain signs which indicate a town or otherinhabited place—such as cowherds, cattle keepers, boundary lines,"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"322   AAIV 2  P 304^305gardens, woods, groves, or the signs of groves, or a village, city, markettown, capital or royal city. From these signs he will infer the nearness of aninhabited place. He feels relieved and is no longer afraid of robbers,outcasts, fierce beasts of prey, hunger or thirst. Just so a Bodhisattva towhom the perfection of wisdom appears of its own accord, and who thentakes it up, bears it in mind, recites and studies it, and wisely attends to it,should know that he is quite near the prediction to the supreme enlighten-ment and before long he will be fully enlightened. Nor should he beafraid of the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas. Because he hashad these indications, i.e. that he has received this deep perfection ofwisdom for vision, praise, worship, and hearing.The Lord: So it is, Śariputra, so it is.IV2B,10. HE REACHES A STATE FREE FROM IMPEDIMENTS.Go on, Śariputra, and, through the might of the Buddha, make theproblem still clearer!Śāriputra: A man desirous of seeing the great ocean, might travel to-wards it. As long as on his travels he would see a tree or the signs of a tree, amountain or the sign of a mountain, he would know that the great oceanis still far away, and not at all near. Because in the neighbourhood of thegreat ocean no tree or sign of a tree can be seen, no mountain or sign ofa mountain. But if he no longer sees any tree or mountain, then it occursto him that he is no longer far from the great ocean, but near it. Becausein the neighbourhood of the great ocean no tree or sign of a tree can beseen, no mountain or sign of a mountain. Although that man may notyet see the great ocean directly before his eyes, he nevertheless can bequite certain that: 'I am near the great ocean, quite near here is thegreat ocean, not much farther from here is the great ocean'. Just so, OLord, this Bodhisattva who hears the perfection of wisdom, takes it up,bears it in mind, recites and studies it, and wisely attends to it, shouldknow and reflect that 'although face to face with the Lord I have notbeen predicted to full enlightenment—i.e. 'after so many aeons, so manyhundreds of aeons, etc. to: so many hundreds of thousands of niyutasof kotis of aeons you will fully know the utmost enlightenment!',—inspite of that he should know: 'I am now quite near to the prediction tothe utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment. And why? Because I havereceived this deep perfection of wisdom for the sake of vision, praising,worship, and hearing, and, having heard it, I take it up, bear it in mind,recite and study it, and attend wisely to it'.IV2B,11. NEARNESS TO SUPREME ENLIGHTENMENT.When spring approaches, the withered leaves on the trees act as tokensto the men of Jambudvipa who then know that quite soon new leaves,"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"P 305-306  AAIV 2   323flowers and fruits will manifest themselves. For when these symptomshave appeared on the trees, before long leaves, flowers, and fruits willmanifest themselves. When they have seen these symptoms on the trees,the men of Jambudvipa will be overjoyed. Just so, when a Bodhisattvareceives his deep perfection of wisdom for vision, praise, worship, andhearing, and if, on having heard it, he takes it up, bears it in mind, recitesand studies it, and wisely attends to it, he should be known as one whohas matured his wholesome roots for a long time, as one who has honouredmany Buddhas. That Bodhisattva should know that through his previouswholesome roots he moves in the direction of (?) the supreme enlighten-ment. He also should know that, since he has received this deep perfectionof wisdom for vision, praise, and worship, and since he makes progressin the perfection of wisdom as it has been expounded, those divinities whohave seen the Buddhas of the past will be overjoyed, exultant, and jubi-lant. For they feel that before long this Bodhisattva will receive hisprediction to the supreme enlightenment, since also with the Bodhi-sattvas of the past these were the symptoms of their coming prediction tofull enlightenment.IV2B,12. SPEEDY PROGRESS TO FULL ENLIGHTENMENT.When d pregnant women comes nearer and nearer to her confinement,her body becomes more and more twisted (Note: unsteady, agitated,hemmed in), excessive sufferings and weariness arise in her body, shedoes not walk about a great deal, does not have her wits very much abouther, takes little food, finds little rest, and, because these unpleasantfeelings proceed in her, she speaks little. She also abstains from habitualcohabitation because she realizes that she experiences these unpleasantfeelings as a result of indulging in unwise attention in the past, developingand practising it. One knows, by comparison with what befalls otherwomen, that when these symptoms appear in this woman she will beforelong give birth to a child. Just so when in Bodhisattvas—who haveplanted wholesome roots, honoured many Buddhas, observed andpractised good conduct, who have been taken hold of by the good spiritualfriends and who have matured their wholesome roots for a long time—this deep perfection of wisdom appears, and then they take it up, bear itin mind, recite and study it, and attend to it wisely—then one shouldknow that before long they will have their prediction to the supremeenlightenment.The Lord: Well said, Śariputra. In this also you have been inspiredby the Buddha's might.IV2B,13.

They assist innumerable beings with the help of the four means ofconversion. They are established in giving.

How does the development of perfect wisdom on thepart of the Bodhisattvas reach its fulfillment?The Lord: When a Bodhisattva, while coursing in perfect wisdom,does not review the growth of form, etc. nor its diminution.IV2B,15. NEITHER DHARMA NOR NON-DHARMA ARE TAKEN AS A BASIS.The Bodhisattva's development of perfect wisdom reaches itsfulfillment, if, when he courses in perfect wisdom, he does not review'dharma' or 'nondharma', 'past', 'future', or 'present', 'wholesome,unwholesome, or indeterminate', 'conditioned' or 'unconditioned', theworld of sense desire, the world of form, the formless world, the perfectionof giving, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes. And why? Because this ison account of the essential marks of Dharma, on account of irreversibility,of nullity, vanity, unsubstantiality, and voidness.IV2B,16. THE ENDEAVOUR WHICH PERCEIVES THE ASPECT OF UNTHINK-ABILITY.Subhuti: The unthinkable, O Lord, is here demonstrated.The Lord: Because of the unthinkability of form, etc. If, when coursingin perfect wisdom, the Bodhisattva does not perceive that 'form etc. itunthinkable', then he fulfills the perfection of wisdom.IV2B,17. ABSENCE OF ALL DISCRIMINATION.Subhuti: Who will zealously believe in this deep perfection of wisdom?The Lord: A Bodhisattva will zealously believe in this perfection ofwisdom if already in the past he has practiced the six perfections, if he hasplanted wholesome roots under the Tathagatas, if he has honoured manyBuddhas, if he has been taken hold of by good spiritual friends.Subhuti: To what extent, O Lord, has such a Bodhisattva in the pastalready practiced the six perfections, etc. to: has been taken hold of bygood spiritual friends?The Lord: Here, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom does not construct form, or discriminate it; and so with: thesign of form, the own-being of form; and so with; feelings etc. to: all-knowledge. And why? Because form is unthinkable, and so is feeling etc.to: all-knowledge. It is certainly thus that the Bodhisattva is one whoalready in the past has been taken hold of by good spiritual friends.Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, is the perfection of wisdom!The Lord: Because of the depth of form, etc. to : because of the depthof all-knowledge."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"326   AAIV 2-3  P 308-309IV2B,18. THE BESTOWAL OF THE PRECIOUS JFWEL OF THE FRUITS (OF THEHOLY LIFE).Subhuti: A heap of treasure is the perfection of wisdom, a bestowerof precious jewels. This perfection of wisdom, which turns the Wheel ofDharma, bestows the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: the supreme enligh-tenment.IV2B,19. PURITY.A pure heap of all dharmas is the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: On account of the purity of form, etc. to: all-knowledge.IV2B,20. THE DELIMITATION OF TIME. -Subhuti: It would not be surprising if many obstacles should arise tothis deep perfection of wisdom being taught.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. There will be many obstacles tothis deep perfection of wisdom. Therefore one should hurry with one'stask of copying it out, of explaining it, etc. to: of developing it. Oneshould prevent all obstacles from becoming effective. If a son or daughterof good family have one month, or up to a year, in which to copy outthe perfection of wisdom, etc. to: to develop it, they should try to finishtheir task within that period. Because it is a fact that in respect of veryprecious things many obstacles are wont to arise.Subhuti: It is not surprising that Mara, the Evil One, should exerthimself to cause obstacles to this deep perfection of wisdom, i.e. to itsbeing copied out, etc. to: its being developed.The Lord: In spite of that he cannot produce any really effectiveobstacle to a Bodhisattva who wishes to copy it out, etc. to: develops thisperfection of wisdom.IV 3. Qualities.IV3,1. THE ANNIHILATION OF MARA'S POWER.Śāriputra: Through whose might, O Lord, is Mara, the Evil One,prevented from causing obstacles to the Bodhisattvas who copy out,etc. to: develop this perfection of wisdom?The Lord: It is through the might of the Buddha, and also throughthe might of those Buddhas and Lords who abide in all the ten directions.For those Buddhas and Lords bring to mind and assist those Bodhi-sattvas, and Mara, the Evil One, cannot cause an obstacle to Bodhi-sattvas who are assisted by the Buddhas and Lords, when they copy outthis perfection of wisdom, etc. to: develop it. For Mara, the Evil One,is just incapable of causing an obstacle to Bodhisattvas assisted by theBuddhas and Lords. For it is in the nature of things that countless Tatha-"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"P310   AAIV3   327gatas who abide in all the ten directions in inumerable world systemsshould bring to mind the Bodhisattvas who copy out, etc. to: developthis perfection of wisdom.IV3,2. ONE IS BROUGHT TO MIND BY THE BUDDHAS AND IS AWARE OFTHE FACT.It is through the Buddha's might that a son or daughter of good familycopies out, etc. to: develops this deep perfection of wisdom.Śāriputra: Any such son or daughter of good family who do so do sothrough the Buddha's might, and they are all upheld by the Buddha?The Lord: So it is, Śariputra.IV3,3. ONE IS PLACED INTO THE SIGHT OF THE BUDDHAS.Śāriputra: The Buddhas and Lords who abide in all directions ininnumerable world systems know those sons and daughters of goodfamily with their cognition and see them with their fleshly eye, when theycopy out this deep perfection of wisdom, etc. to: progress to Thusness?The Lord: So it is, Śariputra.IV3,4. ONE IS QUITE NEAR TO ENLIGHTENMENT.And of these sons and daughters of good family who belong to thegreat vehicle one should know that they are quite near to the supremeenlightenment.IV3,5. ONE REALISES THE GREAT AIM, ETC.If, after having copied out this deep perfection of wisdom and made itinto a book, they will bear it in mind, then they will gain an abundance ofresolute faith in it. If they honour, revere, and worship it, they are knownand seen by the Buddhas and Lords, and the Tathagatas see them withtheir Buddha-eye. And it will be greatly profitable to those sons anddaughters of good family, a great advantage, fruit and reward that,having copied out this deep perfection of wisdom, they bear it in mind.Through that wholesome root they will never again be deprived of theBuddhas, the Lords; they will never again be reborn in the states of woe;when reborn among gods and men they will never be deprived of theBuddhas and Bodhisattvas, and they will transcend the irreversiblestage. Nor will they, as a result of this wholesome root, ever be deprivedof the six perfections, the emptinesses, the applications of mindfulness,etc. to: the Buddhadharmas, or of all-knowledge.IV3,6. ONE CAN JUDGE THE CHARACTER OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.And this Perfection of Wisdom will, after the passing away of theTathagata, appear in the South; from there it will move to the East,"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"328   AAIV3  P 311-312and from there to the North. In each of these directions monks and nuns,laymen and lay women will copy out this deep perfection of wisdom,take it up, bear it in mind, recite and study it, and attend to it wisely.As a result of this wholesome root they will not go to the great distress ofsome wretched destiny. Having succeeded in experiencing life amonggods or men, they are elevated by the six perfections. They honour,revere, and worship the Buddhas and Lords, and gradually they will goforth by one of the three vehicles, i.e. the Disciple-vehicle, the Pratyeka-buddha-vehicle, or the great vehicle.Therein this deep perfection of wisdom does the work of a Buddha.And why? For when the Dharma-Vinaya is like freshly made cream thegood Dharma does not disappear. I bring to mind those sons anddaughters or good family who will copy out this deep perfection ofwisdom, etc. to: progress to its Thusness. And also those sons anddaughters of good family who copy out this deep perfection of wisdom,honour, revere, and worship it, they also as a result of this wholesomeroot will not go to the great distress of some wretched destiny. Havingsucceeded in experiencing life among gods and men, they are elevated bythe six perfections. They honour, revere, and worship the Buddhas andLords, and gradually go forth by one of the three vehicles, i.e. the Disciple-vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, or the great vehicle. For they areseen by the Tathagata with his Buddha-eye, they are praised by theTathagata. And the Buddhas and Lords who abide in all the worldsystems which extend in all the ten directions all around, also thoseTathagatas see those sons and daughters of good family with theirBuddha-eye, praise, and extol them.Śāriputra: Will then this deep perfection of wisdom in the last time,in the last period, be widespread in the Northern direction?The Lord: Yes, it will. In the last time, in the last period, there will besons and daughters of good family who will hear this deep perfection ofwisdom, will copy it out, take it up, bear it in mind, recite and study it,wisely attend to it, and progress to its Thusness; and they will have set outfor a long time in the vehicle, will have honoured many Buddhas, willhave planted wholesome roots under the Tathagatas.Śāriputra: How many of these sons and daughters of good familywill there be?The Lord: In the last time, in the last period, at the extinction of theDharma, there will be in the North many sons and daughters of goodfamily, who belong to the Bodhisattva-vehicle, but there will be few who,having heard this deep perfection of wisdom, will believe; who, havingbelieved, will read, write, take it up, bear it in mind, study, recite, ex-pound, and preach it, attend wisely to it, develop it (by meditation) andprogress to its Thusness."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"P313   AAIV3   329IV3,7. ALL DHARMAS WITHOUT OUTFLOWS ARE PERFECTED.And they, having heard this deep perfection of wisdom being taught,will not be cowed or despondent, will not tremble, be frightened or terri-fied. And why? Because these sons and daughters of good family havepursued the Tathagatas, have questioned and counterquestioned them,by resorting to just this deep perfection of wisdom. And why? Becausethese sons and daughters of good family will become quite full of theperfection of wisdom, of the perfection of meditation, etc. to: of theeighteen kinds of emptiness, etc. to: of the eighteen special Buddha-dharmas. And why? Supported by their wholesome roots they will workthe weal and ease of many people, with reference to just this utmost,right, and perfect enlightenment.IV3,8. ONE BECOMES A PERSON WHO CAN COMMUNICATE THE DOCTRINE.And why? Because I, Śariputra, have preached to them sermonsconnected with the knowledge of all modes. Those also who in a pastperiod have been Tathagatas, they also have for those sons and daughtersof good family preached sermons connected with the knowledge of allmodes. Even when they have passed beyond (this) birth, just these ideas,i.e. referring to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment, will persistby force of habit. They again will preach to others just these sermons,i.e. with reference to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.IV3,9. ONE CANNOT BE DEFLECTED FROM ENLIGHTENMENT.And again these sons and daughters of good family will be united inharmony in the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment. But Mara, or thedeities of Mara's host, will not be able to deflect such a one from theutmost, right, and perfect enlightenment; how much less can he bedeflected by other evil wishes or habitual ideas; that is not possible.IV3,10. GENESIS OF AN UNCOMMON STORE OF MERIT.And again, those sons and daughters of good family who belong to theBodhisattva-vehicle, will, having heard this deep perfection of wisdom,acquire an uncommon degree of zest, serene faith, and elation, and theywill establish many people in wholesome dharmas, i.e. with referenceto the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.IV3,11. THE PLEDGE IS GENUINELY REDEEMED.And these sons and daughters of good family in my presence whenthey were face to face with Me, have said: 'We, O Lord, will establishmany hundreds of living beings, yea, many hundreds of thousands ofkotis of living beings in wholesome roots, with a view of their winningthe supreme enlightenment; we shall hold up perfect enlightenment to"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"330   AA1V3   P314them, instigate, encourage, and incite them to win it, and help them tobe predicted to irreversibility! And why? For I have rejoiced at thewords of these sons and daughters of good family who belong to theBodhisattva-vehicle, and also when I had surveyed their thought withmy thought I certainly rejoiced at those sons and daughters of goodfamily. Those Bodhisattvas, coursing towards enlightenment, willestablish innumerable beings in the supreme enlightenment, instigate,encourage, and incite them to win it, and help them to be predicted toirreversibility.IV3,12. ONE RECEIVES A SUBLIME REWARD.And these sons and daughters of good family will have sublime aspira-tions with regard to forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables, and dhar-mas. They will give sublime gifts and thereby effect sublime wholesomeroots. In consequence they will receive a sublime reward, and for thesake of other beings they will continue to acquire one reward afteranother.IV3,13. ONE IS ACTIVE FOR THE WEAL OF BEINGS.To those beings they renounce all their belongings, be they inward oroutward. Through their wholesome root they will seek rebirth in otherBuddha-fields where they will come face to face with the Tathagatasdemonstrating Dharma. And when they have heard from them just thisperfection of wisdom, they will also in their Buddha-field instigate,encourage, and incite innumerable living beings to win the supremeenlightenment.Śāriputra: It is wonderful to see the extent to which there is not anydharma which the Tathagata has not fully understood, or the Suchness ofany dharma, or the conduct of any being. For he has cognized the Bodhi-sattvas, Buddha-fields and Disciples of the Tathagatas of the past, of thefuture Tathagatas, and of the present Tathagatas, i.e. of those Tathagataswho just now abide in the world systems in all the ten directions and theredemonstrate Dharma.IV3,14. ONE IS CERTAIN TO WIN PERFECT WISDOM.And there are Bodhisattvas who make efforts about these six perfec-tions, and who seek and search for them. Among them some will getthem and others will not.The Lord: As a rule these six perfections will appear to these sons anddaughters of good family. And why? Because they have made effortsabout them.Śāriputra: And will also the very deep Sutras connected with thesix perfections come to them?"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"P315   AA1V3   331The Lord: Yes, they will.Śāriputra: To which sons and daughters of good family will theycome?The Lord: To those who, with intense faith, make efforts about thesesix perfections with utter disregard for their body and life. And why?For it so happens that to those who instigate, encourage, and incitebeings to win the supreme enlightenment the six perfections will appearafter they have passed through this present birth. And proceeding withthe six perfections as they have been expounded they will not relax theirvigour until they purify the Buddha-field, mature beings, and know fullenlightenment."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40MARAIV 4. Faults.IV4,1. ATTAINMENT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY.Subhuti: The Lord has proclaimed these virtues of those sons anddaughters of good family who have set out for the supreme enlightenment,and who will course in the six perfections, mature beings, and purifythe Buddha-fields. Which obstacles will, on the other hand, arise tothem?The Lord: Only after a long time will they understand (this perfectionof wisdom). This should be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhisattvas.Subhuti: For what reason will they understand only after a long time?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, willvery laboriously fulfill the perfection of wisdom, and the other perfections.In this way he will understand only after a long time.IV12. SUDDEN FLASHES OF IDEAS ARISE TOO QUICKLY.Moreover, sudden flashes of ideas will arise too quickly. This alsoshould be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhisattvas.Subhuti: In what way does to the Bodhisattvas a deed of Mara arisefrom the sudden spread of their flashes of insight?The Lord: Here to a Bodhisattva who courses in the six perfections,but who is without the wholesome root of skill in means, sudden flashesof ideas arise too quickly.IV4,3. THREEFOLD UNSUITABLE BODILY BEHAVIOUR.Moreover, they will copy out this perfection of wisdom while yawning,while laughing, and while sneering at one another.IV4,4. THREEFOLD UNSUITABLE MENTAL BEHAVIOUR.Moreover they will copy it out with their thoughts disturbed; they willcopy it out with their minds on other things. Or it will occur to theseBodhisattvas that 'we do not derive any enjoyment from this', and withthese words they will get up from their seats and take their leave.IV4,5. RECITATION FOR THE WRONG REASONS.Furthermore they will yawn, get up from their seats, and take their"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Z>316   AAĪWA   333leave. Or yawning they will study, bear in mind, recite, demonstrate,and attend. Or, laughing at one another they will learn, bear in mind,recite, study, and wisely attend. Or, sneering at one another they willwrite, learn, etc. to: wisely attend. Or, with thoughts disturbed they willlearn, etc. Or they will learn, etc. with their minds on other kinds of talk.IV4,6. CONSIDERATION OF REASONS FOR REJECTING THE SUTRA.Subhuti: As the Lord has said: 'We do not derive any enjoyment fromthis', with these words they will get up from their seats and take theirleave. This also should be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhisattvas.For what reason do they not derive any enjoyment from this?The Lord: Because in the past also they have not coursed in the sixperfections. Furthermore, it is another deed of Mara that it occurs to theBodhisattvas that they are not predestined for this perfection of wisdom,and so, their thoughts devoid of serene faith, they will get up from theirseats and leave.Subhuti: For what reason do they feel that they are not predestinedfor the perfection of wisdom?The Lord: Bodhisattvas who have not definitely set out (on the careerof a Bodhisattva) are certainly not predicted to the supreme enlighten-ment, and they have no serene faith in this perfection of wisdom becausetheir name is not mentioned in it.Subhuti: For what reason are the names of Bodhisattvas not pro-claimed in this deep perfection of wisdom?The Lord: Certainly the names of unpredicted Bodhisattvas are notproclaimed. They think to themselves that 'my name is here not pro-claimed, nor that of the village, city, market place, royal city, or nation (?)where I was born', and then decide that the perfection of wisdom is notworthwhile their listening to and that they had better leave that assembly.And each time they decide to leave they get away from the Buddha-dharmas. As often as they have the thought of leaving, for so manyaeons they will have to take to (Birth-and-death) and make new effortsagain and again.IV4,7. DESERTION OF THE CAUSE OF BUDDHAHOOD (i.e. the Prajñāpāramita)Having spurned the perfection of wisdom which nourishes the cognitionof the all-knowing, they will seek and search for those Sutras which do notnourish it. In this way those sons and daughters of good family willdecide to spurn the root of the obtainment of the cognition of all-knowledge, and to look instead for support in what are mere branches,leaves, and foliage.Subhuti: Which are the Sutras that do not nourish the cognition of theall-knowing and which they decide to study?"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"334  AA1V4   P317The Lord: They are the Sutras associated with the vehicle of theDisciples and Pratyakabuddhas. They enjoin the applications of mind-fulness, the right efforts, etc. to: the doors to deliverance which consist inemptiness, the signless, the wishless. When they have stood in these, thesons and daughters of good family attain the fruit of a Streamwinner,etc. to: the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha. These are the Sutrasassociated with the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas whichare conducive to nourishing the vehicle of all-knowledge, and which(those people) decide to study after they have spurned the perfection ofwisdom. And why? For the Bodhisattvas have issued from the perfectionof wisdom, and when they train in perfect wisdom they will go forth tothe worldly and supramundane spiritual dharmas and train in them.IV4,8. LOSS OF TASTE FOR THIS MOST SUBLIME (TEACHING).Just as a dog would spurn a morsel (of food or a sip of water) from aservant; just so, in the future, some persons belonging to the great vehiclewill spurn this deep perfection of wisdom which is the root of all theBuddhadharmas, and decide instead to study the Sutras associated withthe vehicles of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, Sutras which are likebranches, leaves, and foliage. This also will be Mara's deed to them.Furthermore, there will be in the future some adherents of the Bodhi-sattva-vehicle who, having spurned this deep perfection of wisdom, willdecide to study the Sutras associated with the vehicle of the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas for the sake of gain and honour.IV4,9. DESERTION OF THE SUPREME VEHICLE.If a man who wants an elephant were to get hold of one and then becontent to examine his foot, would that man be an intelligent person?Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: The same is true of those persons who belong to the Bodhi-sattva-vehicle and who, having spurned this deep perfection of wisdom,decide to study the Sutras associated with the vehicles of the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas. What do you think, Subhuti, would these followers ofthe great vehicle be very intelligent?Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord: This also should be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhi-sattvas.IV4,10. DESERTION OF THE HIGHEST GOAL.Just as a person would want to see the great ocean; on having seen it hewould look for a puddle in a cow's footprint. On having seen that hewould say to himself that it is of the same size as the great ocean. What doyou think, Subhuti, would that be a very intelligent person?"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"i>318  AA1V4   335Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: The same is true of the followers of the great vehicle who,after they have heard and obtained this perfection of wisdom, abandonit to learn the Sutras associated with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas.What do you think, Subhuti, would they be very intelligent people?Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord: This also should be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhi-sattvas.IV4,11. DESERTION OF BOTH THE CAUSE (OF BUDDHAHOOD) AND THEFRUIT CONNECTED WITH IT.Just as a mason, or mason's apprentice, would want to build a palaceof the size of the Vaijayanta palace and would take his measure from thesize of the sun and moon, would that be an intelligent thing to do?Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: Just so there will be in the future some followers of theBodhisattva-vehicle who, after they have heard and obtained this deepperfection of wisdom, will spurn and reject it and will decide to searchfor the knowledge of all modes in the Sutras associated with the Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas. Would these people be very intelligent?Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: This also should be known as Mara's deed to Bodhisattvas.IV4,12. DESERTION OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE (FORM OF EXISTENCE).Suppose some person sees the commander of a fort and thinks tohimself that he is like the universal monarch in his complexion and shape.Having observed the aspects, signs, and tokens of the complexion andshape of the commander of a fort he would say that these are the distinctiveaspects of the complexion and shape of the universal monarch. What doyou think, Subhuti, would that be an intelligent person?Subhuti: No, Lord!The Lord: Just so there will be in the future some followers of thegreat vehicle who, after they have heard and obtained this deep perfectionof wisdom, will spurn and reject it and will decide to search for theknowledge of all modes in the Sutras associated with the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas. Would these people be very intelligent?Subhuti: No, Lord.The Lord: This also should be known as Mara's deed to the Bodhi-sattvas.IV4,13.

These flashes ofideas will concern sight objects, sounds, etc. to: Buddhadharmas and thesupreme enlightenment. And why? For the perfection of wisdom iswithout flashes or ideas, it is unthinkable and inconceivable. It is notproduced or stopped, not denied or purified. It cannot be disturbed,it is inexpressible, it is without basis. And why? Because in this deepperfection of wisdom those dharmas do not exist. If some follower of theBodhisattva-vehicle is disturbed by these dharmas when they hear orcopy out this deep perfection of wisdom, then that also is Mara's deed tohim.IV4,14. ONE SETTLES DOWN IN THE IDEA THAT THIS TEXT IS COPIED OUT.Subhuti: Is it then possible to write down the perfection of wisdom?The Lord: No, Subhuti. And why? Because the own-being of theperfection of wisdom does not exist, nor that of the other perfections, theemptinesses, the Buddhadharmas or all-knowledge. That of which theown-being does not exist, that is nonexistence; what is nonexistencecannot be written down by the nonexistent.IV4,15. ONE SETTLES DOWN IN THE IDEA THAT IT IS NONEXISTENCE.

This also should be known as Mara's deed to them.IV4,17. ONE ADHERES TO IT AS NOT IN THE LETTERS.And why? Because this perfection of wisdom is not in the letters, norare the other perfections, etc. to: all-knowledge. But if followers of thegreat vehicle settle down in the perfection of wisdom, etc. as not in theletters, then that also should be known as Mara's deed to them.IV4,18.

In this way also Mara, the Evil One, will arrangeobstacles and disturbances to those who copy out this deep perfection ofwisdom, expound and repeat it, wisely attend to it.IV4,19. A TASTE FOR GAIN, HONOUR, AND FAME.Furthermore, they will relish the thought of gain, honour, and fame,be concerned about their robes, almsbowl, lodging, and medicinalappliances for use in sickness. This also is Mara's deed to them.IV4,20. ONE SEEKS FOR SKILL IN MEANS WHERE IT CANNOT BE FOUND.Furthermore, Mara, the Evil One, will bring along very deep Sutras tothe Bodhisattvas who copy out this deep perfection of wisdom, expoundand repeat it, and wisely attend to it. But Bodhisattvas who are skilledin means should not long for those very deep Sutras which Mara hasbrought along. And why? Because they do not nourish all-knowledge.But Bodhisattvas, who have no skill in means, will, after they have heardit, reject this deep perfection of wisdom in which I have extensivelyexplained skill in means and in which it can be extensively found. Thatthese followers of the great vehicle should, having rejected this deepperfection of wisdom, seek for skill in means in those Sutras associatedwith the vehicle of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, that also shouldbe known as Mara's deed."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41THE ABSENCE OF MARA'S HOSTSIV4,21.

This discord is anotherdeed of Mara which affects the study of the perfection of wisdom.IV4,26. THE ONE IS GENEROUS, THE OTHER STINGY.Furthermore it may be that the teacher is one who gives away every-thing, without niggardliness in his heart, whereas the pupil is stingy, withmany wishes, with evil wishes, and attaches weight to gain, honour, fame,robes, etc. On the other hand it may be that the pupil is the one who givesaway everything and has no niggardliness in his heart, whereas theteacher is stingy and niggardly. This discord is another deed of Marawhich affects the study of the perfection of wisdom.IV4,27. THE ONE IS WILLING TO GIVE ADVICE, THE OTHER NOT WILLINGTO ACCEPT.Furthermore it may be that the pupil is willing to give robes, etc. to theteacher, but that the teacher is not willing to accept them. This discord,a deed of Mara, also affects the study of the perfection of wisdom. On theother hand, it may be that the teacher is willing to accept from the pupil,but that the pupil is not willing to give. This discord again is Mara'swork.IV4,28. THE ONE REQUIRES A BRIEF EXPLANATION, AND THE OTHER GIVESA DETAILED ONE.Furthermore it may be that the teacher understands as soon as themain points are mentioned, whereas the pupil needs elaborate instruc-tions, cannot understand unless all the details are explained, and insists onverbal expressions being laboriously explained. Or conversely, the pupilunderstands at a mere hint, whereas the teacher needs lengthy explana-tions. This discord is again Mara's work.IV4,29. THE ONE HAS THE HIGHER KNOWLEDGE OF THE DHARMA (ASEXPOUNDED IN) THE SUTRAS, WHILE THE OTHER HAS NOT.Furthermore it may be that the teacher knows the exposition of"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"340   AAIV 4  P 321-322Dharma (dharmāntara? Note!), i.e. the Discourses, Discourses in Proseand Verse Mingled, Predictions, Verses, Summaries, Origins, Thus-was-said, Birth-Stories, Expounded Texts, Marvels, Tales and Expositions,whereas the pupils do not. This discord also is Mara's work.IV4,30. THE ONE IS ENDOWED WITH THE SIX PERFECTIONS, THE OTHERIS NOT.Furthermore it may be that the teacher is endowed with the six perfec-tions, whereas the pupil is not. Or, alternatively, the pupils may beendowed with the six perfections, whereas the teacher is not. This discordalso is Mara's work.IV4,31. THE ONE HAS SKILL IN MEANS, THE OTHER HAS NOT.Furthermore the teacher may have skill in means with regard to thesix perfections, whereas the pupils have none.

THE ONE LOVES TO WRITE, ETC. THIS TEXT, THE OTHER DOES NOT.Furthermore it may be that the teacher is willing to copy out, bear inmind, recite, and repeat, etc. to: attend, whereas the pupils have no suchdesires. Or it may be that the pupils who are willing to copy out, etc.whereas the teacher has no such desire. This discord also is Mara's work.IV4,34. THE ONE HAS SENSE DESIRES, ETC., THE OTHER IS FREE FROM THEM.Furthermore it may be that the teacher is free from sense desire, illwill, sloth and torpor, excitedness and sense of guilt, or doubt, whereasthe pupils are not free from them. Or alternatively, the pupils are freefrom the hindrances, whereas the teacher is not. This discord also isMara's work.IV4,35. THE AVERSION TO BEING REBORN IN THE STATES OF WOE.Moreover someone will come along to those who copy, etc. to: whodevelop this deep perfection of wisdom, and disparage life in the hells,among the animals or the Pretas, saying 'so ill are the hells, so ill is theanimal world, so ill is life among the Pretas. Do make an end of ill justhere and now; what point is there in your fully knowing the supremeenlightenment?' This is another one of Mara's deeds."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"P 322-323  AA IV 4  341IV4,36. DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF GOING TO A BLISSFUL EXISTENCE.Moreover someone will come along to those who copy, etc. to: whowisely attend to this deep perfection of wisdom, and praise life among the(27) kinds of gods. 'So happy is life among the gods, in the world of sensedesire because of the enjoyment of sense pleasures, in the world of formbecause of the trances and transic attainments, and in the formless worldbecause of its calm. All this, however, is impermanent, ill, empty, notthe self or belonging to a self, doomed to reversal, fall, cessation, andstopping. Do attain the fruit of a Streamwinner just here and now, etc.to : do attain the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha just here and now!Do not err about in Samsara for a long time!' This is another one ofMara's deeds.IV4,37. THE ONE IS FOND OF SOLITUDE, THE OTHER OF COMPANY.Furthermore it may be that the teacher lives alone, without a second,and does everything by and for himself, whereas the pupil prefers thecompany of others. Or, conversely, the pupil may live alone, whereasthe teacher prefers the company of others. This discord also is Mara'sdeed.IV4,38. THE PUPIL WISHES TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE TEACHER WHO GIVESHIM NO OPPORTUNITY.Furthermore the teacher may say 'to those who come to where I am Iwill give this perfection of wisdom, so that they can copy it, etc. to:develop it', whereas the pupil refuses to come. Conversely, the pupilmay wish to go where the teacher is, but the teacher gives him no oppor-tunity to do so. This is another one of Mara's deeds.IV4,39. THE ONE NEEDS SOME MATERIAL HELP, THE OTHER IS UNWILLINGTO GIVE IT.Furthermore the teacher is willing to give this perfection of wisdom inreturn for some material help, but the pupil does not wish to approachhim for fear of having to offer it. This is another one of Mara's deeds.IV4,40. THE ONE GOES TO A PLACE OF DANGER, THE OTHER TO A SAFEPLACE.Furthermore the teacher may want to go to a district where he is indanger of his life, but the pupil does not want to go there. Or converselythe pupil may want to go to a district where he is in danger of his life,but the teacher does not want to go there. This is another one of Mara'sdeeds.IV4,41. THE TEACHER GOES TO A PLACE WHICH IS SHORT OF FOOD, AND THEPUPIL REFUSES TO COME WITH HIM.Furthermore the teacher may want to go to a place which is short of"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"342  AA IV 4  P 324food and water, but the pupil will not want to go there. Or the teachermay have gone to a place where there is plenty of food and water, and thepupils will follow him there. He, however, will say to them : 'You maythink that it is a good thing for you to come here, because you think thatyour material needs will be supplied. But I am afraid that you will regrethaving come, when you see how little alms-food can be had here'. Inthis way the teacher refuses Dharma by means of a subtle device. Andthey will in disgust interpret his remarks as signs of refusal, and not assigns of willingness to give. This is another one of Mara's deeds.IV4,42. THE TEACHER GOES TO A PLACE HAUNTED BY ROBBERS, ETC.Furthermore the monk who is a teacher may move to a place wherethere is danger from robbers, outcasts, desperadoes, fierce beasts of prey,vipers, wild jungles, and treacherous roads. And the pupils who wishto hear this deep perfection of wisdom will follow him there. To themthis monk will say, 'why do you want to go where there are all thesedangers?' Though the pupils, desirous of hearing this deep perfection ofwisdom, are willing to follow the teacher, the monk who is the teacherdoes not wish to teach them, and does not wish to see to it that this deepperfection of wisdom is copied out, proclaimed or heard. Having heardthe teacher's remark, they do in their disgust not go to where he goes.This is another one of Mara's deeds.IV4,43. THE TEACHER LIKES TO SEE THE FAMILIES WHO FEED HIM.Furthermore the teacher may be one of those who attach weight totheir relations with the families who give them alms, constantly go to seethem, and refuse their prospective pupils on the ground that they have tosee those families and pay visits to them. Refused, those pupils will turnback. This is another one of Mara's deeds.IV4,44. MARA, THE EVIL ONE, MAKES AN EFFORT TO DISSUADE FROMWISDOM.Moreover, Mara, the Evil One in the guise of a monk bestirs himself toprevent, by many devices, anyone from copying this perfection of wisdom,etc. to: from attending to it.Subhuti: For what reason does he do so?The Lord: Because as a result of the perfection of wisdom all beingscan forsake their defilements. Moreover, Mara, the Evil One, will comealong in the guise of a monk, in order to cause dissension and he will saythat 'this Sutra as it has come to you is not the perfection of wisdom' inorder to dissuade people from copying etc. the perfection of wisdom.Moreover, approaching in the guise of a monk, Mara, the Evil One, willsay, 'a Bodhisattva who courses in this deep perfection of wisdom realizes"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"P 324-325  A A IV 4  343the reality limit, and attains the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: theenlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha'. Some of those who have heardthose words will then not course in the perfection of wisdom. This isanother one of Mara's deeds.IV4,45. MARA ARRANGES A COUNTERFEIT (PERFECTION OF WISDOM).Moreover to those who copy, etc. to : develop this deep perfection ofwisdom many deeds of Mara will arise which will cause obstacles. ABodhisattva should avoid them.Subhuti: Which are the deeds of Mara that a Bodhisattva shouldrecognise and avoid?The Lord: Mara will produce counterfeits of the perfection of wisdomand the other perfections, and of the 18 kinds of emptiness. Others ofhis deeds will be connected with the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, andhe will say: 'study these (?) and then attain the fruit of a Streamwinner,etc. to : Arhatship! Develop these four applications of mindfulness, etc.to: the wishless door to deliverance! What is the point of your fullyknowing the supreme enlightenment?' In this way Mara will arrangemany deeds of this kind.IV4,46. MARA PRODUCES A LONGING FOR UNDESIRABLE THINGS.Moreover, Mara, the Evil One, will approach in the guise of the Buddha,with a body all shining like gold and the halo extending for a fathomaround him. When the Bodhisattva has seen Him, longing will rise up inhim, and he will fail to win all-knowledge. Moreover, Mara, the Evil One,will exhibit in front of those sons and daughters of good family a commu-nity of monks headed by the Buddha. Longing will thereupon arise in theBodhisattva, and he will think that 'I also will at a future period be such aTathagata, and I will likewise foster a host of monks. As this Tathagata,so will I also demonstrate DharmaP As a result of this longing he will failto win all-knowledge. Moreover, Mara, the Evil One, will exhibit manyhundreds and thousands of Bodhisattvas who course in the six perfections,Some Bodhisattvas will feel longing for those illusory magical creationsconjured up by Mara, and as a result they will fail to win all-knowledge.And why? Because in this deep perfection of wisdom no form exists, nofeeling, etc. to: no enlightenment. And when no form exists, etc. to: noenlightenment, there also Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Disciples do notexist. And why? Because all dharmas are in their own-being empty.IV4,47. THE BUDDHA'S GREAT MIGHT AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE SIMILE OF THEPRECIOUS THINGS IN JAMBUDVIPA, AND SO ON.Moreover this perfection of wisdom will be bound up with manyobstacles for those who bear it in mind, recite, explain and study it, and"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"344  AAIV 4  P 325-326wisely attend to it. Just as the precious things that there are in Jambudvipa,such as gold, gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, crystal, coral, silver,etc. are subject to many obstacles and provoke much hostility; just sothose who copy, etc. to: develop this deep perfection of wisdom willendure many obstacles and much hostility.Subhuti: So it is, O Lord, so it is, O Sugata. The Sutras associated withthe perfection of wisdom will provoke much hostility. Beset by Mara,of small and sluggish intelligence will be those deluded persons who willcause obstacles to this deep perfection of wisdom being copied, etc. to :being developed. Nor will their intelligence be able to function in thesevery sublime dharmas if they do not copy, etc. to: develop this deepperfection of wisdom, or if they cause obstacles to those who copy, etc. to :develop it.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. Those people who will not copy out,etc. to : wisely attend to this deep perfection of wisdom and who will causeobstacles to it being copied out, etc. to: developed, they will be beset byMara, they will have newly set out in the vehicle, they have planted nowholesome roots, have but tiny wholesome roots, have not done theirduties under the Jinas of the past and have not been taken hold of by thegood spiritual friends. Small, sluggish, and limited will be their intelli-gence, and their thought will be unable to stride up into very sublimedharmas. But although these deeds of Mara are bound to arise when thisdeep perfection of wisdom is being copied out, etc. to: is being developed,nevertheless it is due to the Buddha's might that often no deeds of Maraand no obstacles arise to the study of this deep perfection of wisdom andthat in addition sons and daughters of good family can perfect the otherfive perfections, as well as the emptinesses, etc. to : the Buddhadharmasand the knowledge of all modes. Those Buddhas and Lords who abide inthe ten directions and demonstrate Dharma will make efforts on behalfof those sons and daughters of good family who copy out, etc. to : attendto this deep perfection of wisdom. And so will the irreversible Bodhi-sattvas in the ten directions, and they will bring help.It is as with a woman who has many children—five, ten, twenty,forty, fifty, or one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand.If she feels ill, they will all exert themselves so that their mother maynot meet with any obstacle to her life, so that she may live long, so thatno unpleasant touch may hit her body. For they feel that she is theirgenetrix and has given them their body and their life. They will thereforelook well after their mother, protect her well, and hope that she willmeet with no obstacle to her life, that her body will not become excessivelyweak, and that she be free from pain caused by stinging insects, mosquitos,crawling animals, by a fall, or by cold, hunger or thirst. In this way thesons give their mother everything that can make her happy, make much"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"P 327-328  AAIV 4  345of her and cherish her, because they are aware that she has instructedthem in the ways of the world. In this way the Tathagatas bring this deepperfection of wisdom constantly and always to mind with their Buddha-eye. And why? Because they are aware that this deep perfection ofwisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagatas and their instructress in thecognition of all the Buddhadharmas, and the maker (?) of the world. Andthe Buddhas and Lords who abide in all the ten directions in countlessworld systems, they also constantly and always bring to mind just thisdeep perfection of wisdom with their Buddha-eye. And why? Becausethis deep perfection of wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagatas and theirinstructress in the cognition of the all-knowing. It is because of this thatthe Tathagatas, motivated by gratitude, constantly and always bring thisdeep perfection of wisdom to mind with their Buddha-eye, And why?From it have come forth for the Tathagatas the six perfections, the (18)kinds of emptiness, etc. to: the eighteen Buddhadharmas, the six super-knowledges, the knowledge of all modes of all the Buddhas, the countlessand numberless Buddhadharmas. From it have come forth the Stream-winners, etc. to: the Tathagatas, Arhats, fully enlightened Buddhas. Allthe Tathagatas who have known, do know, and will know the supremeenlightenment, they all do so thanks to this deep perfection of wisdom.And those followers of the great vehicle who will copy out this deepperfection of wisdom, etc. to: attend to it, they also will all be broughtto mind constantly and always by the Tathagatas with their Buddha-eye,and the Tathagatas will constantly and always arrange for them shelter,defense, and protection, so that they may not fail to win the supremeenlightenment."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42SHOWING THE WORLDIV 5. MarksIV5,1. THE MARKS OF COGNITION.IV5,la. THE MARKS OF THE COGNITION AS REGARDS ALL-KNOWLEDGEIV5,la,l. COGNITION OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE TATHAGATA.Subhuti: The Lord has said that 'the perfection of wisdom is thegenetrix of the Tathagatas and their instructress in this world.' How then isshe the genetrix of the Buddhas and Lords? How is she their instructress inthe world? How has the Tathagata been generated by the deep perfectionof wisdom? And what is it that the Tathagata has proclaimed as 'theworld'?The Lord: The ten powers of a Tathagata have been generated by thisdeep perfection of wisdom, and likewise the four grounds of self-confi-dence, the great friendliness, the great compassion, the 18 special dharmasof a Buddha and his knowledge of all modes. It is through these dharmasthat a 'Tathagata' becomes manifest. That is why it is this deep perfectionof wisdom which has generated the Tathagata.IV5,la,2. COGNITION OF THE WORLD.Subhuti: What is it that the Tathagata has proclaimed as 'the world'?The Lord: The five skandhas.Subhuti: And how have the five skandhas been shown up by theperfection of wisdom?The Lord: The perfection of wisdom does not show up these fiveskandhas as crumbling or crumbling away, as being produced or stopped,as being defiled or purified, as undergoing growth or diminution, toilingor withdrawal from it, nor does it show up past, future or present dharmas.And why? Because emptiness does not crumble, nor crumble away, andso also the Signless, the Wishless, the Uneffected, Nonproduction,Stopping, Nonexistence and the absence of own-being. It is thus thatthe Tathagata has proclaimed the deep perfection of wisdom as theinstructress in the world."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"P 329  AA IV 5, 1  347IV5,la,3. COGNITION OF THE THOUGHTS AND DOINGS OF ALL BEINGS.It is also thanks to the perfection of wisdom that those who know thethoughts of others can wisely know the thoughts and doings of countlessbeings. Though in this deep perfection of wisdom no being or concept of abeing can be apprehended; no form or concept of form; etc. to: noknowledge of all modes, or concept of the knowledge of all modes. It isthus that this deep perfection of wisdom instructs the Tathagatas in theworld, but she does not show up form, etc. to : all-knowledge. And why?Because even the perfection of wisdom itself does not exist in the perfectionof wisdom, nor can it be apprehended in it; how much more so with form,etc. to : the knowledge of all modes.IV5,la,4-5. COGNITION OF COLLECTED AND DISTRACTED THOUGHTS.Moreover the Tathagata wisely knows collected and distracted thoughtsas they really are as 'collected and distracted thoughts', and that appliesto the thoughts of all beings, as many as there are, conceived under theconcept of beings—with or without form, with or without perception,and with neither perception nor nonperception, in this world system orin other world systems in the ten directions. And how does he do so?Through Dharmahood.Subhuti: Through which kind of Dharmahood?The Lord: Through that Dharmahood in which even the Dharmahoodcannot be apprehended, how much less collected thoughts and distractedthoughts.IV5,la,6. THE COGNITION OF THE MODE OF NONEXTINCTION OF THOUGHTS.Moreover the Tathagata wisely knows as they really are the collectedand distracted thoughts of those beings under the aspect of nonextinction.And how does he do so? He wisely knows those thoughts in the aspect oftheir stopping, their forsaking, their peaceful calm, their vanity, andtheir isolatedness.IV5,la,7-8. THE COGNITION OF THOUGHTS WITH AND WITHOUT GREED,ETC.Moreover the Tathagata wisely knows as they really are thoughts withgreed, hate, or delusion, and thoughts without greed, hate, or delusion.Subhuti: And how does the Tathagata wisely know thought withgreed, hate, or delusion, as it really is?The Lord: The thought which is with greed, hate, or delusion is notthe thought as it really is. And why? Because thought as it really is cannotbe apprehended, nor can the dharmas which constitute thought, howmuch less so thought that is with greed, hate, or delusion!

A thought marked by absence of greed is not a thought markedby its presence. And why? Because there can be no meeting oftwo thoughts. The same applies to hate and delusion.IV5,la,9. THE COGNITION OF EXTENSIVE THOUGHTS.Moreover, the Tathagata, thanks to this deep perfection of wisdom,wisely knows as it really is the extensive thought of other beings andpersons as 'extensive thought'. And how does he do so? Here the Tatha-gata wisely knows as it really is that the thought of other beings andpersons is neither expanded nor contracted, for it does not grow ordiminish, does not come or go. And why? Because of a thought no own-being can be apprehended which could effect an expansion, etc. to:which could come.IV5,la,10. THE COGNITION OF THOUGHT WHICH HAS GONE GREAT.Moreover the Tathagata, thanks to this perfection of wisdom, wiselyknows as it really is of other beings and persons the thought which hasgone great as 'thought which has gone great'. And how does he do so?Because he does not review of those thoughts the coming or going, theproduction or stopping, the stability or alteration. And why? Becausethose thoughts have no own-being which could come or go, be producedor stopped, be stable or altered.IV5,la,ll. THE COGNITION OF UNLIMITED THOUGHTS.Moreover thanks to this perfection of wisdom, the Tathagata wiselyknows as it really is of other beings and persons the unlimited thought as'unlimited thought'. And how does he do so? Because with regard to thisthought He does not review that it is, nor that it is not, nor does He reviewit as discontinuous, or as not discontinuous. And why? Because unlimitedtrends of thought have no support, since for them there exists no founda-tion on which they could be firmly grounded.IV5,la,12. THE COGNITION OF THOUGHTS AS UNDEFINABLE.Moreover thanks to this perfection of wisdom the Tathagata wiselyknows as it really is of other beings and persons the undefinable thoughtas 'undefinable thought'. And how does he do so? Because he wiselyknows as they really are those thoughts as without marks, as devoid ofownbeing, on account of the emptiness of own-marks.IV5,la,13.

And how does hedo so? He wisely knows that wherever they may arise they are all de-pendent on the five skandhas. If we take such statements as—'TheTathagata continues to exist after death'. 'The Tathagata does notcontinue to exist after death', 'The Tathagata neither does nor does notcontinue to exist after death'—then these statements refer to the skan-dhas only. The same applies to statements such as, 'Eternal are self andthe world—just that is the truth, everything else is delusion'. And so ifone considers that self and the world are noneternal, both eternal andnoneternal, neither eternal nor noneternal. Likewise if one maintainsthat self and the world are finite, or not finite, or both finite and notfinite, or neither finite nor not finite. Or, finally, if one says 'that whichis the soul, that is the body', or 'one thing is the soul, another the body'.IV5,la,15.

THE COGNITION WHICH UNDERSTANDS THE SUCHNESS OF THEFULLY ENLIGHTENED BUDDHAS AND CAN COMMUNICATE IT TO OTHERS.In this way the Suchness of the affirmations and negations, of the con-tractions and expansions is the Suchness of the skandhas, elements,sense fields and conditioned coproduction; and that is the Suchness of alldharmas and the Suchness of the six perfections; and that is the Suchnessof the 37 dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment; etc. to: theSuchness of the 18 special dharmas of a Buddha is the Suchness of all-knowledge; and that is the Suchness of wholesome and unwholesomedharmas; and that again is the Suchness of the dharmas which areworldly and supramundane, with or without outflows, with and withoutfaults, with and without defilements, defiled or purified, conditioned orunconditioned. And the Suchness of the conditioned and unconditionedis the Suchness of past, future, and present dharmas; and that again is theSuchness of the Streamwinner, and that the Suchness of the fruit of aStreamwinner, etc. to : the Suchness of the enlightenment of a Pratyeka-buddha is the Suchness of the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment;"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"350  AA IV 5, 1  P 332that again is the Suchness of a Tathagata, and that the Suchness of allbeings.

As indistinctthis Suchness is indistinguishable and because it is indistinguishable it isnot divided. This is the Suchness of all dharmas which, thanks to theperfection of wisdom, the Tathagata has fully known. In this way thisSuchness of the perfection of wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagatas,and in this way this perfection of wisdom is the instructress in the world.It is thus that the Tathagata cognizes the Suchness of all dharmas, theirnonfalseness, their unaltered Suchness. And it is because of this Suchnessthat the Tathagata is called a Tathagata'.Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, is this Suchness of all dharmas, their non-falseness, their unaltered Suchness. It is through this Suchness that theenlightenment of the Buddhas, the Lords has been revealed.

COGNITION OF THE NATURE OF DHARMA AS UNDISTURBED.(As something that cannot be upset?)Gods, those marks cannot possibly be altered by the world with itsgods, men, and Asuras. And why? Because that world with its gods,men, and Asuras has also that very same mark. For a mark cannot altera mark. A mark cannot wisely know a mark, nor can a mark wiselyknow a no-mark, nor can a no-mark wisely know a mark, nor can a no-mark wisely know a no-mark.

As it is established, so the Tathagatahas fully known it. Therefore is he called the Tathagata.IV5,lb,15. COGNITION OF THE DISTINCTIONS (BETWEEN DHARMAS).The Gods: These deep marks have been fully known by the Tathagata.Because of his full knowledge of them there proceeds the Tathagata'sunattached vision and cognition, and, having stood in these marks, theTathagata has revealed all the marks.

COGNITION OF THE ABSENCE OF MARKS.The Lord: The Tathagata has fully known the marklessness of formmarked by molesting (being liable to destruction); and so with feelingmarked by experiencing, perception marked by taking up, the impulsesmarked by together-making, consciousness marked by recognition; theperfection of giving marked by renunciation, the perfection of moralitymarked by celibacy, the perfection of patience marked by immovability,the perfection of vigour marked by uncrushability, the perfection of con-centration marked by comprehension, the perfection of wisdom markedby nonattachment; the four trances, the four Unlimited, the four formlessattainments marked by immovability; the 37 dharmas which act as wingsto enlightenment marked by leading forth; emptiness as a door to deliver-ance marked by detachment, the signless as a door to deliverance markedby quiet calm, the wishless as a door to deliverance marked by the removalof suffering; the deliverances marked by delivering, the powers markedby being well determined, the grounds of self-confidence marked by beingwell established, the analytical knowledges marked by being indes-tructable, the great friendliness marked by providing what is beneficial,the great compassion marked by protection, the great sympathetic joymarked by rejoicing, the great impartiality marked by noncomming-ling; the 18 special Buddhadharmas marked by being something towhich no one else has a claim; and the cognition of the knowledge of allmodes marked by being 'before the eye'. It is thus that the Tathagata hasfully known all dharmas as unmarked, and that is why the Tathagata iscalled the one who has the cognition of nonattachment.IV5,lc.

Because it is from this perfection ofwisdom that the Buddhas, the Lords manifest themselves. Grateful is theTathagata, the Arhat, the fully enlightened Buddha, thankful is theTathagata, the Arhat, the fully enlightened Buddha. Rightly would hespeak who would say of the Tathagata that he is 'grateful and thankful'.And how is the Tathagata grateful and thankful? The Tathagata honours,values greatly, reveres and worships, favours and cherishes that vehicleon which he has come and that progressive path by which he has wonfull enlightenment.IV4,lc,6. THE COGNITION OF THE ABSENCE OF AN AGENT.Moreover the Tathagata has, relying on the signlessness of all dharmas,fully known all dharmas as not made on account of the nonbeingness ofan agent. He has fully known them as not unmade, on account of the non-beingness of their suppression. This, also, Subhuti, should be seen asthe gratitude and thankfulness of the Tathagata. Thanks to the perfectionof wisdom He has thus fully known the inactivity of all dharmas.IV5,lc,7. THE COGNITION WHICH REACHES EVERYWHERE.Moreover it is thanks to the perfection of wisdom that the Tathagata'scognition has proceeded in all dharmas as unmade as though really ithas not proceeded, and the proceeding is only a matter of convention.In this way the perfection of wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagata,and instructs him in this world.IV5,lc,8. THE COGNITION THAT (THE BUDDHA) CAN SHOW THAT WHICHIS IMPERCEPTIBLE.Subhuti: If all dharmas, O Lord, are unknowable and imperceptible,how can the perfection of wisdom be the genetrix of the Tathagata and hisinstructress in this world?The Lord: So it is, so it is. All dharmas are unknowable and imper-ceptible. And why are they so? Because all dharmas are empty, worthless,insignificant, void, and insubstantial. In this way all dharmas are unknow-able and imperceptible. Moreover, Subhuti, all dharmas are unknowableand imperceptible because they are unsupported and unincluded. It is thusthat the perfection of wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagata and his in-structress in this world.

It is thus, Subhuti, thatthis deep perfection of wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagata and hisinstructress in the world.IV5,lc,9. THE COGNITION OF THE WORLD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OFEMPTINESS.Furthermore how is the perfection of wisdom the genetrix of theTathagata and his instructress in the world? Here the perfection of wisdomindicates that the world is empty. And why does she do so? Here in theworld the five skandhas are empty, the 12 sense fields are empty, etc. to:the knowledge of all modes is empty. It is thus that the perfectionof wisdom is the genetrix of the Tathagata and his instructress in thisworld.IV5,lc,10.

COGNITION OF UNTHINKABILITY.Moreover the perfection of wisdom shows up to the Tathagata theworld as unthinkable. How? It shows up that the five skandhas are theworld which is unthinkable. Moreover the perfection of wisdom showsup to the Tathagata the world, in other words the five skandhas, asisolated, as absolutely empty, as empty of own-being, as empty throughthe nonexistence of own-being.IV5,lc,14.

THE COGNITION OF THE CESSATION OF THE PERCEPTION OF THEWORLD.And again how does this deep perfection of wisdom show up the world?So that no perception of this world or the other world takes place.

ACCEPTANCE OF COGNITION OF DHARMA IN SUFFERING: UN-THINKABILITY.Subhuti: For the sake of a great performance, O Lord, has this per-fection of wisdom been set up, for the sake of an unthinkable,incomparable, immeasurable, and equal to the unequalled (P: incal-culable) performance.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. And how has the perfection ofwisdom been set up as a great performance? It is a great performance onthe part of the Tathagatas that they protect all beings and do not abandonthem. And how has the perfection of wisdom been set up as an unthinkableperformance? Unthinkable is Buddhahood, Tathagatahood, Self-Existence, and the state of all-knowledge. In this way has the perfectionof wisdom been set up for an unthinkable performance on the part of theTathagatas, the Arhats, the fully enlightened Buddhas.IV5,2,2. COGNITION OF DHARMA IN SUFFERING: INCOMPARABILITY.And how has the perfection of wisdom been set up for an incomparableperformance? There is no being whatsoever, among those who are com-prehended under the term 'beings,' who woyld be able to think Buddha-hood, Tathagatahood, Self-Existence, and the state of all-knowledge,or to compare it.IV5,2,3. ACCEPTANCE OF THE SUBSEQUENT COGNITION OF SUFFERING :IMMEASURABILITY.And how has the perfection of wisdom been set up for an immeasurableperformance? The Buddhahood, Tathagatahood, Self-Existence, andstate of all-knowledge of the Tathagatas is immeasurable, and it cannot bemeasured by anyone."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"P 337-338  AAIV 5,2   357IV5,2,4. SUBSEQUENT COGNITION OF SUFFERING : INCALCULABILITY.And how has the perfection of wisdom been set up for a performancewhich equals the unequalled? Because nothing can be quite equal to theTathagatas, the Arhats, the fully Enlightened Ones, how much less cananything be superior to them!Subhuti: Are then Buddhahood, Tathagatahood, Self-Existence, andthe state of all-knowledge unthinkable, incomparable, immeasurable,and equal to the unequalled?The Lord: Yes, they are. And so are also form, etc. to : all-knowledge.All dharmas in fact are unthinkable, immeasurable, and equal to theunequalled. With regard to the Dharmahood of all dharmas no thought,and no dharmas belonging to thought, can be apprehended. Form also,as unthinkable, etc. cannot be conceived, and so up to the knowledge of allmodes.Subhuti: For what reason can form, etc. as unthinkable, etc. not beconceived?The Lord: Because with regard to form, etc. one cannot conceive ofthe thinking, the comparing, the measuring, the equality or inequality.Subhuti: And for what reason is that so?The Lord: Because also of form, etc. the own-being is unthinkable, etc.What do you think, Subhuti, can form, etc. be apprehended in what isunthinkable, etc.?Subhuti: No, OLord!The Lord: In that manner all dharmas are unthinkable, etc. And theseTathagata-dharmas of the Tathagata are unthinkable, etc. They are un-thinkable because thinking has ceased and been transcended, comparingand measuring have ceased and been transcended, equality and inequalityhave ceased and been transcended. 'Unthinkable', that is a synonym ofincomparable, etc. These Tathagata-dharmas of the Tathagata areunthinkable because space is unthinkable, incomparable because space isincomparable, etc. etc. This also is of the Tathagata the Tathagata-unthinkability, -incomparability, -immeasurability, and -equality to theunequalled, which cannot be thought or compared by the world with itsgods, men, and Asuras. Thus are the Buddhas immeasurable, thus are theBuddhadharmas immeasurable.When this chapter on the Tathagata's unthinkability, etc. was beingtaught, the minds of 500 monks were freed, without further clinging,from the outflows, and so were the minds of 2,000 nuns; 6,000 lay brethrenobtained with regard to dharmas the pure, dispassionate, unstainedDharma-eye, 20,000 Bodhisattvas won the patient acceptance of dharmaswhich fail to be produced, and the Lord has predicted that they willbecome Buddhas in this very Bhadra-kalpa."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44THE CONGREGATIONIV5,2,5.

For entrusted to this perfection ofwisdom are the five perfections, entrusted to it are the various kinds ofemptiness, the four applications of mindfulness, etc. to : the knowledge ofall modes. Just as an anointed king, a Kshatriya, who feels strong andsecure in his kingdom, entrusts all his business concerning the kinglyoffice and the kingdom to his minister; he himself has few cares andhis burden is light as regards the business concerning his kingly dutiesand his activities concerning the kingdom; just so, Subhuti, whateverdharmas of the Disciples, the Pratyekabuddhas, the Bodhisattvas, or theBuddhas there may be, they are all entrusted to the perfection of wisdom,and the perfection of wisdom in them does the work. Therefore, then, hasthe perfection of wisdom been set up for a great performance, for a per-formance which is unthinkable, incomparable, immeasurable, equal tothe unequalled. And why?

Moreover, the Bodhisattva, the great being, has been rebornamong the Tushita gods and he should be known as endowed with justthese same qualities. And why?

But if that Bodhisattva, thatgreat being in the past, when he heard this deep perfection of wisdom,has not asked questions and counterquestions about it, then, when nowthis deep perfection of wisdom is being preached, he feels hesitation,stupefaction, and despondency of thought.

SUBSEQUENT COGNITION OF THE PATH: THE ABSENCE OFRELISHING.Subhuti: How, O Lord, should a Bodhisattva, a great being whois a beginner, train in the perfection of wisdom and the other five per-fections.The Lord: Here, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva, who is a beginner and whowants to train in the perfection of wisdom and the other five perfections,should tend, love, and honour the good spiritual friends, who explainto him this deep perfection of wisdom, as follows: 'Come here, son ofgood family, whatever gift you may have given, whatever morality youmay have guarded, etc. to: whatever wisdom you may have developed—all that, having made it common to all beings, do dedicate to the supremeenlightenment! But do not misconstrue the supreme enlightenment asform or as any other skandha! Do not misconstrue it as one of the per-fections, one of the emptinesses, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes!And why? For the skandhas when not misconstrued, reach an all-knowledge which is also not misconstrued. Nor should you produceany longing for the skandhas, etc. to: a Bodhisattva's special way ofsalvation, etc. to: the supreme enlightenment. And why? Because allthese are not worth longing for. And why? Because all dharmas areempty of own-being.'IV5,3. THE MARKS OF ACTIVITY.Subhuti: Doers of what is hard are the Bodhisattvas, the great beingswho, when all dharmas are empty of own-marks, strive for the supremeenlightenment and want to fully know it.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. And yet, Subhuti, although theyhave known all dharmas as like a mock show or a dream, the Bodhisattvas,the great beings have set out towards the supreme enlightenment for thebenefit and welfare of the world, so that they can become a shelter forthe world, a refuge, a place of rest, the final relief, islands, torchbearers,caravan leaders and light bringers, and leaders of the world.IV5,3,1.

HE BRINGS EASE.And how has the Bodhisattva set out for the world's Ease? Here theBodhisattva, the great being who wants to fully know the supremeenlightenment, liberates beings from physical ills, mental sadness, anddespair, and places them on the shore where there is nothing to fear,into the safety of Nirvana.IV5,3,3. HE GIVES SHELTER.And how does the Bodhisattva who wants to fully know the supremeenlightenment become the world's shelter? He protects beings fromall the sufferings which belong to Samsara; he demonstrates Dharmaso that these sufferings might be forsaken, and he leads the beings whohave heard that Dharma gradually to Nirvana through the three vehicles.IV5,3,4. HE GIVES REFUGE.And how does the Bodhisattva who wants to fully know the supremeenlightenment become a refuge for beings? He sets free from birth,decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and despair thosebeings who are doomed to undergo these conditions, and he leads themto the realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind.IV5,3,5. HE PROVIDES A PLACE OF REST.And how does the Bodhisattva, who wants to fully know the supremeenlightenment, become a resting place for beings? He demonstratesDharma to beings so that they may learn not to embrace anything.Subhuti: How does the nonembracing of all dharmas come about?The Lord: The nonembracing of form, etc. to : of the knowledge of allmodes, is the same as their nonconnection; and that is the same as theirnonproduction, and that is the same as their nonstopping.IV5,3,6. HE PROVIDES FINAL RELIEF.And how does the Bodhisattva who wants to fully know the supremeenlightenment become the final relief of beings? He demonstrates tobeings the Dharma as follows: The Beyond of form, etc. that is not form.And as form, so all dharmas.Subhuti: If as form so all dharmas, then a Bodhisattva must surelyhave fully known all dharmas. And why? Because in the Beyond of form,etc. there is no discrimination, to the effect: this is form, this is feeling,etc. to: this is the knowledge of all modes."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"P 351-353  AAIV 5,3   369The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is.

HE ACTS AS AN ISLAND.And how does a Bodhisattva, when he has fully known the supremeenlightenment, become the world's island? Islands are pieces of landlimited all round by water, in rivers, or great oceans. Just so form, etc.is limited at its beginning and end, and so everything up to the knowledgeof all modes. By this limitation of their beginning and end are all dharmascircumscribed. And this limitation of all dharmas at their beginning andend is the Calm Quiet, the Sublime, That which really is, i.e. emptiness,nonbasis, the nonannihilation of Dharma, the extinction of craving,the nonembracing, dispassion, stopping, Nirvana. It is thus that theBodhisattva, when he has fully known the supreme enlightenment, revealsthese dharmas, so calm, so sublime. And how does the Bodhisattva,when he has fully known the supreme enlightenment, become a torch-bearer of beings, a light bringer to them? He reveals to beings the truemeaning associated with the four means of conversion, and establishesthem in it.And how does the Bodhisattva, when he has fully known the supremeenlightenment, become a caravan leader to beings? He points out tobeings who have set out on a bad road or who find themselves at somecrossroads the one single suitable path, which is conducive to purity,the transcending of sorrows and misfortunes, the going to rest of physicalills and mental sadness, the attainment of the methodically correctDharma, and the realisation of Nirvana.IV5,3,8. HE ACTS AS A LEADER.And how does the Bodhisattva, when he has fully known the supremeenlightenment, become a leader of beings? He demonstrates and revealsdharma for the sake of the nonproduction, nonstopping, nondefilementand nonpurification of form, etc. to: of the supreme enlightenment.IV5,3,9. HE DOES NOT TURN TOWARDS ANYTHING.And how does the Bodhisattva, when he has fully known the supremeenlightenment, become the resort of beings? He demonstrates dharmato beings to the effect that form, etc. is situated in space; that the emptinessof form, etc. is situated so that it has not come, i.e. it neither comes norgoes. And why? For all dharmas are situated in emptiness and from"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"370  AAIV 5,3  P 353-355that situation they do not depart. And why? For of emptiness no comingor going can be apprehended. And so for the Signless and Wishless.Situated in the Uneffected are all dharmas and they do not depart fromthat situation. And why? Because of the Uneffected no coming or goingcan be apprehended.IV5,3,10. THE (NON?) REALIZATION OF THE FRUIT.For all dharmas are situated in nonproduction and nonstopping, andfrom that situation they do not depart. And why? Because of non-production and nonstopping no coming or going can be apprehended.And the same formula is applied to : nondefilement and nonpurification;dream, magical illusion, echo, reflection, mirage, firewheel, magicalcreation; endless and boundless; unrecoverable and unremovable;nonaddition and nonsubtraction. For all dharmas have not come, andfrom that situation they do not depart. And why? Because noncoming,coming, and going cannot be apprehended. Likewise all dharmas aresituated in non-toiling and absence of toiling; they are situated in non-binding and unbinding, they are situated in nonjoining and disjoining.They are situated in the self and from that situation they do not depart.And why? Because absolutely a self does not exist; how could its comingand going take place? And as for the self, so for being, living soul, etc.to: one who sees. And in the same sense all dharmas are situated inpermanence, ease, the self, the lovely; and likewise in impermanence,ill, not-self, and the unlovely; in greed, hate, delusion, wrong views;for an entity made by false views does not exist, how can the false viewsthemselves take place? For situated in Suchness are all dharmas, andfrom that situation they do not depart. And why? Because the coming orgoing of Suchness cannot be apprehended. And so for the Dharma-element, the Reality limit, Sameness, the unthinkable element, andimmobility.IV5,3,11. HE BECOMES A MEANS OF SALVATION.For all dharmas are situated in form, and from that situation theydo not depart. And why? Because absolutely form does not exist; howcould its coming or going take place? And so for the other four skandhas,the six perfections, the various kinds of emptiness, the fruits, etc. to:the supreme enlightenment.Subhuti: Who will there firmly believe in this so deep perfection ofwisdom?The Lord: Those Bodhisattvas, great beings, Subhuti, who haveformerly coursed in the direction of full enlightenment, who have donetheir duties under the Jinas of the past, have matured wholesome rootsunder the Jinas of the past, have honoured many hundreds of thousands"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"P 355  AA IV 5, 3^  371of niyutas of kotis of Buddhas, and have been taken hold of by the goodspiritual friends—they will firmly believe in this deep perfection ofwisdom.IV5,4.

IT IS HARD TO DO.Subhuti: Doers of what is hard are those Bodhisattvas, great beingswho have put on this armour, 'all beings we will lead to Nirvana'. Andyet therein no being and no concept of a being is apprehended.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. Moreover, Subhuti, the armour ofthat Bodhisattva, that great being, is not tied up with form, etc. And why?Because absolutely form, etc. does not exist, and also not the Bodhisattva'sarmour. Therefore it is said that not tied up with form surely is thisarmour. And so with feeling, etc. to: the knowledge of all modes.IV5,4,6. IT IS DEVOTED TO ONE AIM ONLY.Subhuti: Of that Bodhisattva, that great being who has thus put on"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"P 357-359  /L4IV5,4   373the great armour, 'all beings we will lead to Nirvana', two stations shouldnot be expected, i.e. the level of a Disciple or the level of a Pratyekabuddha.It is impossible, O Lord, it cannot be that a Bodhisattva, a great beingwho has thus put on the armour, 'I will lead all beings to Nirvana',should fall on the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha. That cannotpossibly be. And why? Because the Bodhisattva, the great being has not,hemmed in by boundaries, put on the armour for the sake of beings.The Lord: For what reason do you, Subhuti, say that of that Bodhi-sattva, that great being, who thus puts on the armour and courses inthis deep perfection of wisdom, neither of these two levels can be expected,i.e. the level of a Disciple or of a Pratyekabuddha?IV5,4,7. THE PROGRAMME.Subhuti: Because there, O Lord, that Bodhisattva, that great beinghas not put on the armour for the sake of a limited number of beings or forthe sake of a limited kind of cognition. And why? For the sake of leadingall beings to Nirvana and for the sake of the cognition of the knowledgeof all modes has the Bodhisattva, the great being, put on the armour.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. It is not for the sake of a limitednumber of beings that the Bodhisattva, the great being, has put on thearmour. But on the contrary, for the sake of leading all beings to Nirvanaand for the cognition of the knowledge of all modes has the Bodhisattva,the great being put on the armour.IV5,4,8. IT OFFERS NO BASIS.Subhuti: Deep, O Lord, is this perfection of wisdom. She is not to bedeveloped by anyone, nor should anything be developed, nor should onedevelop anywhere. And why? Because in this deep perfection of wisdomone does not get at the full reality of any dharma, which would develop,or which he would develop, or through which he would develop. Adevelopment of space, O Lord, is this development of the perfection ofwisdom. A development of all dharmas, a development of what is not,a development of not taking hold of, a development which is really anundevelopment, that is this development of the perfection of wisdom.The Lord: Of what, Subhuti, is the development of the perfection ofwisdom an undevelopment of development?Subhuti: Of form this is an undevelopment of development; of feeling,etc. to : the knowledge of all modes.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. This development of perfectwisdom is an undevelopment of the development of form, etc. to: theknowledge of all modes.IV5,4,9. NO SETTLING DOWN.And the Lord further said (āmantrayate) to the Ven. Subhuti: The"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"374  AAIV 5,4  P 359-360irreversible Bodhisattva, great being, should thoroughly ponder on thisdeep perfection of wisdom, for then he does not settle down in this deepperfection of wisdom (as if it were a real thing). And so he should tho-roughly ponder on the other five perfection, etc. to : on the knowledge ofall modes, for then he does not settle down in the knowledge of all modes.For then that irreversible Bodhisattva, great being, who courses in thisdeep perfection of wisdom, does not look upon the critical argumentsand hints of others as having validity; he does not go by someone elsewhom he puts his trust in; he does not pertake of thoughts connectedwith greed, hate, and delusion; he is not deprived of the six perfections;and when this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught, he will nottremble, be frightened or terrified, nor will his mind turn back; but hedelights in hearing this deep perfection of wisdom, and, having heard it,he takes it up, studies it, bears it in mind, teaches it, attends wisely to it,and progresses to Thusness. One should know, Subhuti, that in a formerlife already that irreversible Bodhisattva, great being, has asked questionsand counterquestions about this deep perfection of wisdom, and haslearned it and wisely attended to it. And why? Because the irreversibleBodhisattva, when this deep perfection of wisdom is being taught, doesnot tremble, is not frightened or terrified, is not cowed or despondent,and his mind does not turn back on it. In addition, when he has heard it,he learns and studies it, bears it in mind, and preaches it, and wiselyattends to it.Subhuti: How should a Bodhisattva who, when this deep perfectionof wisdom is being taught, does not tremble, etc. to : does not allow hismind to turn back on it, apprehend this deep perfection of wisdom?IV5,4,10. THE OBJECTIVE SUPPORT.The Lord: The Bodhisattva, the great being, should apprehend thisdeep perfection of wisdom through a series (of thoughts) inclined tothe knowledge of all modes.Subhuti: How does the Bodhisattva, the great being, through a series(of thoughts) inclined to the knowledge of all modes have an apperceptionof this deep perfection of wisdom?The Lord: The Bodhisattva has an apperception of this deep perfectionof wisdom through a series (of thoughts) inclined to emptiness, thesignless, the wishless, to space, etc. to : nonproduction and nonstopping,to nondefilement and nonpurification, to Suchness, the Dharma-element.the Reality limit, Sameness, the unthinkable element, to the Uneffected,to a dream, etc. to : a magical creation.Subhuti: When the Bodhisattva, the great being, has an apperceptionof this deep perfection of wisdom through a series (of thoughts) inclinedto emptiness, etc. to: a dream and a magical creation, does he then"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"P 361  AA IV 5, 4  375apperceive form, or feeling, etc. to : the knowledge of all modes?The Lord: When a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom, he doesnot apperceive form, etc. to : consciousness, etc. to : the knowledge of allmodes. And why? Because the knowledge of all modes has not beenmade or unmade, it has not come from anywhere nor gone to anywhere,it does not stand in any spot or place, and its definition cannot be appre-hended, nor its coming or going. But that of which no definition and nocoming or going can be apprehended, that cannot possibly be fullyknown by anyone, not through form, or any of the other skandhas.And why? Because form is not the knowledge of all modes, nor is anyof the other skandhas. And why? For the Suchness of form and theSuchness of the knowledge of all modes are just one single Suchness.And so for feeling, and everything up to the eighteen special Buddha-dharmas."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48SETTLEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF A BODHISATTVAThereupon the gods of the realm of sense desire and of the realm ofform took heavenly sandalwood powder, took heavenly blue lotuses,pink lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses, and scattered them overthe Lord.

ANTAGONISM TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.The Lord: So it is, O Gods.

And the Suchness of all-dharmas isthe same as that of the Tathagata. But the Tathagata's Suchness is ano-Suchness.

The Suchness of the Tathagata,and the Suchness of all dharmas, they are both one single Suchness, nottwo or divided. Unmade is that Suchness, and there is nothing of which itis not the Suchness; that is why it is not two or divided. It is in this sensethat the Elder Subhuti is born after the image of the Tathagata. Every-where this Suchness is immutable, indiscriminate, and undifferentiated,and so is also the Suchness of Subhuti. Just as the Tathagata's Suchnessis not broken apart, unbroken, unbreakable, and unapprehensive, sois that of Subhuti. It is thus that Subhuti the Elder is born after the imageof the Tathagata. As the Suchness of the Tathagata cannot fail to be theSuchness of each and every dharma, just such is that Suchness; just sois Subhuti the Elder born after the image of the Tathagata because he isnot other than Him. But he is not born after the image of anything. It isthus that Subhuti the Elder is born after the image of the Tathagata.As the Suchness of the Tathagata is not past, future, or present, so alsothe Suchness of all dharmas. It is thus that Subhuti the Elder is calledborn after the image of the Tathagata, born after the image of Suchness.Through the Suchness of the sameness of the past is the Suchness of thesameness of the Tathagata; through the sameness of the Suchness of theTathagata is the Suchness of the sameness of the past. And so for thefuture and present. In consequence the Suchness of the past, future,and present, and the Suchness of the Tathagata, are not two or divided.Through the Suchness of the Tathagata is the Suchness of form, etc.In consequence the Suchness of form, etc., and the Suchness of theTathagata, are not two or divided.

THE NONAPPREHENSION (EVEN) OF SUCHNESS.Śāriputra: Deep, O Lord, is the Suchness, nonfalseness, unalteredSuchness, the Dharmahood, Dharma-element, the established nature ofDharma, the fixed nature of Dharma, the Reality limit—in which noform, etc. is apprehended, nor form-Suchness, etc. Form is just notapprehended, how could the Suchness of form be apprehended?

To 500 nuns therearose the dispassionate, unstained Dharma-eye in dharmas; and 5,000Bodhisattvas—gods and men—acquired the patient acceptance ofdharmas which fail to be produced, and 6,000 Bodhisattvas were freedfrom the outflows without any further clinging. And these Bodhisattvas,great beings, have honoured 500 Buddhas, and have everywhere givengifts, guarded their morality, developed their patience, exerted theirvigour, produced the trances, and developed wisdom. But they were notupheld by perfect wisdom and skill in means. They gave gifts whilecoursing in manifoldness, 'this gift we will give to him, but not to him;we will guard this morality, develop this patience and vigour, enter intothese trances, develop this wisdom'. Lacking in perfect wisdom and notupheld by skill in means they give gifts, etc. to develop wisdom. Coursingin the notion of not-self and the nonapprehension of not-self, they havenot entered on a Bodhisattva's special method of salvation.

Here, again, the Bodhisattvas, thegreat beings, (not?) lacking in the thought of the knowledge of all modes,developing the dharmas of Emptiness, the Signless and Wishless, thanksto their skill in means enter on a Bodhisattva's special way of salvation.Suppose there is a very huge bird, with a body about 100 or up to 500miles large. That bird would intend to fly from the Gods of the Thirty-Three down to here, but it would be deficient in wings. It would take offfrom the Gods of the Thirty-Three, and decide to land here in Jambud-vipa.

It is bound to get damaged and injured, andwhen it drops down on Jambudvipa it will incur death or deadly pain.And why? Because of the fact that, whereas its body is huge, its wings areinsufficient.The Lord: So it is, Śāriputra. Although a Bodhisattva may for aeonscountless as the sands of the Ganges give gifts, etc. to : enter on the trances,and although his setting forth may be great, and his thought of enlighten-ment, and his effort to win the supreme enlightenment; but if he is lackingin perfect wisdom and skill in means, he falls on the level of a Disciple orPratyekabuddha. And why? Because as one who is lacking in the thoughtof the knowledge of all modes has that Bodhisattva given gifts, etc. to :has he produced the trances. And that Bodhisattva, lacking in perfectwisdom and not upheld by skill in means falls on the level of the Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas.

THE AIDS TO EMANCIPATION IN GENERAL.And again, Śāriputra, the Bodhisattva, the great being, beginningwith the first thought of enlightenment, not lacking in the thought of theknowledge of all modes, gives gifts, but does not make that into a sign;he develops the applications of mindfulness, etc. but does not makethat into a sign.IV6b.

For by that Bodhisattva, that great being, beginning withthe first thought of enlightenment, gifts have been given, but that-hasnot been made into a sign; morality has been guarded, etc.; of the past,future, and present Buddhas and Lords the morality, etc. to : the visionand cognition of emancipation have not been made into a sign.

THE AID TO EMANCIPATION WHICH CONSISTS IN CONCENTRATION.And why? For the Bodhisattva, the great being has, beginning with thefirst thought of enlightenment, apprehended no dharma which fullyknows, or by which he fully knows, i.e. form, etc. to: the knowledge of allmodes. But of sons and daughters of good family, who belong to thegreat vehicle, and who are lacking in perfect wisdom and skill in means,of them full enlightenment is not to be expected. And why? Because they,lacking in perfect wisdom and skill in means, have made into a sign allthe gift they have given, all the morality they have guarded, etc. to : all thewisdom they have apperceived. In consequence it is more than doubtfulwhether full enlightenment can be expected of them. Therefore then theBodhisattva, the great being who wants to know full enlightenment,should become one not lacking in perfect wisdom and in skill in means.Having stood in perfect wisdom and in skill in means, without takinganything as a basis, and with a mind connected with the Signless, he shouldgive gifts, etc. to: course in the knowledge of all modes.IV6b,5. THE AID TO EMANCIPATION WHICH CONSISTS IN WISDOM.The gods who belong to the realm of sense desire and the realm of form:Hard to come up to, O Lord, hard to believe in is the utmost enlighten-ment! For here the Bodhisattva, the great being, should fully know alldharmas in all their modes and yet these dharmas do not exist and cannotbe apprehended.The Lord: So it is, O Gods, so it is. Hard to come up to, hard tobelieve in is the utmost enlightenment. By me, however, have all dharmasbeen fully known in all their modes, and yet no dharma has by me beengot at which would fully know, by which one would fully know, andwhich one would fully know. And why? Because of the absolute purityof all dharmas.IV6c. THREE DEGREES OF STRENGTH OF THE AIDS TO EMANCIPATION.IV6c,l.

And whathe fully knows, and that whereby he fully knows, and that which hefully knows, all these dharmas are empty. In this manner, O Lord, easyto win is the supreme enlightenment of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings.And why? Because form, etc., is empty of the own-being of form, etc.IV6c,2. THE WEAK AIDS TO EMANCIPATION.Śāriputra: In this manner, Ven. Subhuti, the supreme enlightenmentis hard to come up to. And why? For it does not occur to space, 'I shallknow full enlightenment'. Just so it does not occur to the Bodhisattva,the great being, 'I shall know full enlightenment'. And why? Because thesame as space are all dharmas. And it is after he has firmly believedin all dharmas as the same as space that the Bodhisattva, the great being,knows full enlightenment. If again on the part of the Bodhisattva, thegreat being who has firmly believed that all dharmas are the same asspace, the supreme enlightenment were easy to win, not hard to come upto, then Bodhisattvas countless like the sands of the Ganges would notturn away from full enlightenment. In this manner, Ven. Subhuti, onecan discern that the supreme enlightenment is hard to come up to, andnot easy to win.IV6c,3.

But then there will no longer be any ground for the distinc-tion of those who have set their hearts on enlightenment into three kindsof persons, who, as described by the Tathagata, differ with respect tothe vehicle which they have chosen. According to the exposition of theVen. Subhuti, there should be only one single kind of Bodhisattva, i.e.the one who belongs to the Bodhisattva-vehicle.Pūrna, the son of Maitrayani: First of all, Ven. Śāriputra, Subhutithe Elder should be asked whether he looks for even one single kind ofBodhisattva!Śāriputra: Do you, Ven. Subhuti, look for even one single kind ofBodhisattva—one who belongs to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas?Subhuti: Do you, Ven. Śāriputra, look in Suchness for three kinds ofBodhisattvas—Bodhisattvas who use the Disciple-vehicle, Bodhisattvaswho use the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, and Bodhisattvas who use theBodhisattva-vehicle ?Śāriputra: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Can then three kinds of Bodhisattvas be apprehended inSuchness?Śāriputra: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Can then Suchness be apprehended as being of one, two, orthree kinds?Śāriputra: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Can one in Suchness then apprehend one single (kind of)Bodhisattva?Śāriputra: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Since, in ultimate truth and as things stand, such dharmascannot be apprehended, wherefrom does the Ven. Śāriputra get theidea that 'this Bodhisattva belongs to the Disciple-vehicle, that Bodhi-sattva to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, and that Bodhisattva again to theBuddha-vehicle'? If a Bodhisattva who thus identifies all dharmas inSuchness does not become cowed or stolid in mind, has no regrets, andis not frightened, then he is bound to go forth to the supreme enlighten-ment.The Lord: Well said, Subhuti, well said!

But if it occurs to the Bodhisattva, the great being, 'surely, Mara,the Evil One, expounds a counterfeit path, 'then, coursing in the perfectionof wisdom, he does not go back on the supreme enlightenment, and doesnot fall back on the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha; and in additionit occurs to him, 'it is impossible, it cannot be that the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, who courses in the perfection of giving, etc. to : who developsthe knowledge of all modes, does not fully know the supreme enlighten-ment.

Andwhy? Because the irreversible Bodhisattva through dharmas which areempty of own-marks enters on the certainty that he will win salvation asa Bodhisattva. He does not apprehend even that dharma and so he cannotput it together or produce it. One therefore says that 'a Bodhisattva whopatiently accepts nonproduction is irreversible'.

All these dharmas are thesame as space, have no own-being for own-being, and are empty of own-marks. It is useless for you to resist. A deed of Mara is this doctrine that'one should know full enlightenment'. It is not the Buddha's teaching.May you, son of good family, not fall into these attentions in the hopethat they will allay (all ill). On the contrary, this is not conducive toadvantage, benefit, or happiness, but leads to a state of punishment.'When that son or daughter of good family has heard this kind of abuse,they should consider that 'this is a deed of Mara that I am being dissuadedfrom the supreme enlightenment.

Therefore we, having put on thearmour which is the same as space, has nonexistence for own-being andis empty of own-marks, will, having fully known the knowledge of allmodes, demonstrate Dharma to all beings, and establish (even) the beingsin hell in the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: in the supreme enlighten-ment.'

He is reborn in those worldsystems in which the Tathagatas stand, hold, and maintain themselves.According to plan he is reborn near them, and he dwells in those attentions,i.e. the attentions on the Buddha.

Because he does not reviewthese dharmas, i.e. him who turns away or him who does not turn away.Just as a man who stands on the stage of a Stream winner has no hesitationor doubts about it if that is the stage which is his by right, and so up to:the Buddha-stage. Just so the Bodhisattva, when he stands on the stagewhich is his own by right, has no hesitations or doubts about it. Establishedon that irreversible stage he purifies the Buddha-fields and maturesbeings. And he quickly sees through any deed of Mara that may havearisen and does not come under its influence. He understands all thesedeeds of Mara and turns away from them. Just as, Subhuti, a man whohas committed one of the deadly sins will never again, until his death,lose the thought of that sin; but it will follow after him; he cannot shakeoff the (irresistible drive towards) the states of woe; its overwhelmingeffect follows him until the time of his death. Just so the irreversiblethought of the irreversible Bodhisattva has been truly established, hecannot be deflected from the irreversible stage, and the whole worldwith its gods, men, and Asuras cannot divert him from it. And why?That irreversible thought, having transcended the world with its gods,men, and Asuras, has entered on the certainty of salvation. Havingstood on the stage which is his by right, he has achieved the completeperfection in the superknowledges, purifies the Buddha-field, and maturesbeings; he passes on from Buddha-field to Buddha-field, and he plantsin these Buddha-fields wholesome roots which allow him to have avision of the Buddhas, the Lords, to salute them respectfully, to honourthem, and to hear the Dharma from them. And in all these Buddha-fields he questions the Buddhas and Lords, counterquestions and honoursthem.

He has no uncertainties aboutthe Reality limit, and he does review the Reality limit as either one ortwo. When he has cognized this, even after he has passed through thispresent life, he will produce no thought on the level of the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas. And why?

You havenot acquired the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be producedand without that you cannot be predicted by the Tathagatas to fullenlightenment. You have not the attributes, tokens, and signs which aBodhisattva must be endowed with to be predicted to full enlightenment'.If a Bodhisattva when he has heard these words, does not become terrifiedin his mind, then this Bodhisattva should know that he has been predictedto full enlightenment by the Tathagatas. And why? Because he knowsthat he has the dharmas endowed with which a Bodhisattva is predictedto the supreme enlightenment.IV8,2,16. SUBSEQUENT COGNITION OF THE PATH: RENUNCIATION OFONE'S LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF DHARMA, WHICH CONSISTS IN THE KNOWLEDGEOF ALL MODES.If Mara, the Evil One, having approached in the guise of a Buddha,or of some person under the influence of Mara, should predict the Bodhi-sattva to the level of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas, then the Bodhi-sattva thinks to himself, 'this one, who wants to establish me on thelevel of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, is surely Mara, the Evil One,who has come along in the guise of the Buddha, or this is a person underMara's influence.' When the Bodhisattva reads and studies the ExtensiveSutras, then Mara, the Evil One, comes to him in the guise of the Buddhaand says to him, 'these have not been taught by the Lords or theirDisciples. Taught by Mara are these Sutras in which you course.' Butthat Bodhisattva should know that it is surely Mara, the Evil One, orsomeone under Mara's influence, who tries to dissuade him from thesupreme enlightenment.

Here the Tathagatas demonstrate Dharma to the effectthat 'all dharmas are empty'. A few deluded persons then contradict andsay that this is not the Dharma, not the Vinaya, not the Teacher, not theTeaching. But the Bodhisattva for the sake of that Dharma gives upeven his self. He becomes convinced that he also will be reckoned as oneof the future Buddhas, that he also has been predicted (to full enlighten-ment) and that his also is the True Dharma for the sake of which he iswilling to give up even self and life.

But it could be that a Bodhisattva who is lackingin perfect wisdom might turn away from the knowledge of all modes.Therefore, then, should the Bodhisattva become one who is not lackingin perfect wisdom.IV8,3,C,11.

And why? For this dedication (in the spirit) of theperfection of wisdom is the best of all rejoicings and dedications.

THE DISCRIMINATION IS MODERATELY WEAK.Subhuti: How can that son or daughter of good family beget a greatermerit, since the Lord has described all (karmic) accumulation as mereimagination. For without (karmic) accumulation one cannot produceright views, or enter on the right way of salvation, or gain the fruit of aStreamwinner, etc. to: fully know the supreme enlightenment.IV8,3,C,16.

But also that gift of a Bodhisattva whocourses in perfect wisdom is without (karmic) accumulation, because ithas been declared to be just empty, null, vain, and insubstantial.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF 'INCALCULABLE', ETC.Subhuti: What is the distinction and difference between the incal-culable, the immeasurable, and the measureless?The Lord: 'Incalculable' is that which has no number, or that towhich calculation does not apply. 'Immeasurable' is that of which nomeasure can be apprehended in past, future, or present dharmas.

As inexpressible has this been talkedabout by the Tathagata. An exposition of the outpourings of demon-stration are the words used by the Tathagata, i.e. 'inextinguishable','incalculable', 'immeasurable', 'measureless', 'empty', 'signless', 'wish-less', 'uneffected', 'nonproduction', 'dispassion', 'stopping', and'Nirvana'.IV8,3,D,4. THE PROBLEM RAISED BY THE ABSENCE OF GROWTH ANDDIMINUTION IN AN INEXPRESSIBLE ENTITY.Subhuti: It is wonderful to see the extent to which the Tathagatahas demonstrated the true nature of all these dharmas although thatDharmahood is inexpressible. As I understand the meaning of theLord's teaching, all dharmas cannot be talked about in any propersense?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti. All dharmas are inexpressible. Theinexpressibility of all dharmas is their emptiness. And emptiness cannotbe expressed in words.Subhuti: Can an inexpressible object have growth or diminution?The Lord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: But if there is no growth or diminution of an inexpressibleobject, then there can be no growth or diminution of the six perfections,etc. to: of the Buddhadharmas. The nonexistence of the six perfections,etc. to : the Buddhadharmas, will be a fact.

But it does not occur to the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, who courses in the perfection of wisdom, develops it, makesefforts about it, and is skilled in means that 4I grow in perfect wisdom;I grow in perfect vigour,' etc. On the contrary it occurs to him, 'a meredesignation is that, i.e. this perfection of giving, etc' When he coursesin the perfection of giving, etc. to: in the perfection of wisdom, he dedicatesthose attributes, those productions of thought, and those wholesomeroots to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment. And he dedicatesso as to conform to that which the utmost, right, and perfect enlighten-ment actually is.IV8,3,D,6.

Therefore the Bodhisattva who regularly andabundantly dwells as one who is not lacking in perfect wisdom, does notreview the growth or diminution of any dharma whatever. It is thus thatthere is no growth or diminution of an inexpressible object. It is thusthat there is no growth or diminution of the six perfections, etc. to : ofthe analytical knowledges. It is thus that the Bodhisattva should coursein the perfection of wisdom, by way of no-growth and no-diminution.IV8,3,E.IV8,3,E,I.Subhuti: Does the Bodhisattva, the great being, awake to the utmost,right, and perfect enlightenment by means of the first production of thethought (of enlightenment), or rather by means of the last production ofthe thought (of enlightenment)? If, O Lord, the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, would, by means of the first production of the thought (of enlighten-ment) fully awake to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment—thatfirst production of the thought (of enlightenment) is not in touch withthe last production of the thought (of enlightenment); the last productionof the thought (of enlightenment) is not in touch with the first.

THE SIMILE OF THE LAMP.The Lord: Therefore, then, Subhuti, will I give you a simile, so thatyou can understand this matter. Through a simile discerning people willunderstand the meaning of the teaching. What do you think, Subhuti,in a burning oil lamp, is the wick burnt by the first incidence of the flame,or by the last incidence of the flame?Subhuti: Not, O Lord, is the wick burnt by means of the first incidenceof the flame, nor independent of it.The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, has now that wick burnt up?Subhuti: It is burnt up, O Lord, it is burnt up, O Sugata!The Lord: Just so, Subhuti, does the Bodhisattva, the great being notfully awake to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment by means ofthe first production of the thought (of enlightenment), nor independentof it; not by means of the last production of the thought (of enlighten-ment), nor independent of it. And yet the Bodhisattva, the great being,does fully awake to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment. Because,Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being, coursing in this perfection ofwisdom, on account of the first thought (of enlightenment), havingfulfilled the ten stages, does awake to the utmost, right, and perfectenlightenment.Subhuti: How, O Lord, does the Bodhisattva, the great being, havingfulfilled the ten stages, awake to the utmost, right, and perfect enlighten-ment?The Lord: Having fulfilled the stage of bright insight does the Bodhi-sattva, the great being, awake to full enlightenment; having fulfilled thestage of becoming one of the clan, etc. to the Bodhisattva-stage does theBodhisattva, the great being, awake to full enlightenment. Traininghimself in the ten stages, the Bodhisattva, the great being, does not bymeans of the first production of the thought (of enlightenment) fullyknow the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment, nor independent of it;nor by means of the last thought (of enlightenment), nor independentof it; and yet he fully knows the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.IV8,3,E,II.

THE DEPTH OF ITS STOPPING.The Lord: The thought which has (not?) been produced, is thatdoomed to stop.Subhuti: It is doomed to stop, O Lord, it is doomed to stop, O Sugata.The Lord: What is doomed to stop, will that be stopped?Subhuti: No, O Lord.IV8,3,E,II3. THE DEPTH OF ITS SUCHNESS.The Lord: Will it abide just as Suchness does?Subhuti: Yes, it will.The Lord: When it will abide just as Suchness does, it would certainlyno be unmoved?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Is Suchness deep?Subhuti: It is deep.IV8,3,E,II4. THE DEPTH OF THE COGNIZABLE.The Lord: Is that thought like Suchness?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Is the thought other than Suchness?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Is Suchness other than the thought?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Is thought in Suchness?Subhuti: No, O Lord.IV8,3,E,II5. THE DEPTH OF THE COGNITION.The Lord: Does then Suchness review Suchness?Subhuti: No, O Lord.IV8,3,E,II6. THE DEPTH OF THE PRACTICE.The Lord: One who courses thus, does he course in the deep perfectionof wisdom?Subhuti: Yes, he does.The Lord: One who courses thus, where (whither) does he course?Subhuti: One who courses thus, he does not course anywhere. Andwhy? Because in the Bodhisattva, the great being, who courses in the"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"414  AA IV 8, 3  P 398perfection of wisdom, these habitual ideas do not proceed, they do nothappen in him. To one who stands in Suchness, nothing happens, norcan anything happen to him.The Lord: The Bodhisattva, the great being, who courses in theperfection of wisdom, where does he course?IV8,3,E,II7. THE DEPTH OF ITS NONDUALITY.Subhuti: He courses in (by means of) ultimate reality, wherein theidea of duality does not exist.The Lord: One who courses in ultimate reality courses in ideas,courses in signs?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Has, then, by him the perception of a sign been annihilated?Subhuti: No, O Lord.IV8,3,E,II8. THE DEPTH OF THE SKILL IN MEANS.The Lord: Has, then, by the Bodhisattva, the great being, the per-ception of a sign (been developed, or the perception of the signless) beenannihilated?Subhuti: That Bodhisattva, the great being who courses in the per-fection of wisdom, does not apply himself thus, 'I will develop the signor I win annihilate the signless'. Here again the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing who courses in the perfection of wisdom, awakens to full enlighten-ment not without having fulfilled the ten powers of a Tathagata, etc.to : the Buddhadharmas. This again is of the Bodhisattva, the great being,the skill in means, by which he does not make any dharma into somethingexistent or something nonexistent. And why? Because there the Bodhi-sattva, the great being, established in the own-mark-emptiness of alldharmas, enters into the three concentrations, for the sake of beingswhom he matures through them. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, enters the three concentrations. How, O Lord, does the Bodhi-sattva, the great being, enter into the three concentrations for the sake ofbeings whom he matures through them?The Lord: Here a Bodhisattva, a great being, having stood in the threeconcentrations establishes in emptiness those beings who course in theperception of discrimination, in the signless those who course in the sign,and enjoins the wishless on those who course in making plans. It is thusthat the Bodhisattva, the great being, coursing in the perfection of wisdom,having stood in the three concentrations, matures beings."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52THE FULFILLMENT OF SKILL IN THE SIX PERFECTIONSIV 9. The Identity of Nirvana and Samsara.Sāriputra: Ven.

Śāriputra, he grows through the development byday, then he also grows in a dream. And why? Because dream and wakingare indiscriminate. If the Bodhisattva who courses by day in the perfectionof wisdom has a development of the perfection of wisdom, then also theBodhisattva, the great being, who dreams will have a development of theperfection of wisdom.Śāriputra: If again, Ven. Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being,does a deed in his dream, will there by of that deed a heaping up oraccumulation? If all dharmas are said to be like a dream, there will be noheaping up or accumulation of it. And why? Because in a dream noheaping up or accumulation of a dharma can be apprehended. But whenone wakes up and thinks it over, then there is a heaping up or accumu-lation of it.Subhuti: One who had committed a murder in his dream, and, onwaking, would think it over like this, 'he has been well killed by me,(A: it is right that he was killed, it is just that he was killed, it was I whokilled him!' Such thoughts are equivalent to the conscious notion that hewants to kill someone).Śāriputra: Not without an objective support does a deed arise or anact of will.Subhuti: So it is, Śāriputra, not without an objective support does adeed arise or an act of will. Only with an objective support is a deedproduced, or an act of will, and not without. In seen, heard, and knowndharmas does intelligence proceed, and not in unseen, unheard, unknowndharmas. Therein some intellectual acts take hold of defilement, andsome of purification. Therefore, then, Śāriputra, it is with an objectivesupport that a deed or act of will arises and not without objective support.Śāriputra: If, Ven.

I do not review (see) that dharma whichwould dispose, or by which one would dispose, or wherein one woulddispose. Nor that dharma which has been predicted to full enlightenment,or whereby it has been predicted, or wherein it has been predicted. Allthese dharmas are nondual and undivided.Śāriputra: Have by you these dharmas then perhaps been realisedin the way in which you teach this dharma?Maitreya : No, they have not.Thereupon it occurred to the Ven. Śāriputra: Profoundly wise surelyis Maitreya, this Bodhisattva, this great being, how he makes this expla-nation after he has coursed for a long time in the six perfections and inbaselessness.The Lord: What do you think, Śāriputra, do you see (review) thatdharma by which you are dignified as an 'Arhat'?Śāriputra: No indeed, O Lord.The Lord: In the same way, Subhuti, it does not occur to the Bodhi-sattva, the great being, who courses in the perfection of wisdom: 'thatgood dharma is being predicted; that good dharma has been predicted;that good dharma fully knows the utmost, right, and perfect enlighten-ment!' Coursing thus, the Bodhisattva, the great being, courses in theperfection of wisdom. Nor does there arise a doubt in him : 'I will notfully know the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.'

She rose from her seat, put her upper robeover one shoulder, saluted the Lord with folded hands, and said: \"I also,O Sugata, when I have coursed in the six perfections, will take hold of sucha Buddha-field, as it has been explained by the Tathagata in the Prajñā-pāramitā.\"Thereupon that woman took golden flowers and silvery flowers,flowers from water plants and flowers from land plants, and all therequisite ornaments, as well as golden-coloured and yellow flowersyoked together, and hurled them to where the Lord was. And immediatelyafter she had done so, through the Buddha's might there stood out highup in the firmament above the Lord's head a pointed tower, with fourpillars, quadrangular, well-proportioned, enjoyable, pleasing to themind. And that woman, having made this pointed tower common to allbeings, dedicated it to their supreme enlightenment.Thereupon the Lord, having perceived that woman's resolute intention,on that occasion manifested a smile. But such is the dharmic nature ofthe Buddhas and Lords that, when they manifest a smile, then various-coloured rays issue from the Lord's mouth—rays blue, yellow, red,white, crimson, crystal, silverish, and golden. Their lustre spread intoendless and boundless world systems, and then again returned fromthere, thrice circulated round the Lord and then vanished in the head ofthe Lord.Thereupon the Ven. Ānanda rose from his seat, put his upper robeover one shoulder, placed his right hand on the earth, stretched hisfolded hands towards the Lord, and said to the Lord: What is the cause,what is the reason for this manifestation of a smile? For it is not withoutcause or reason that the Tathagatas manifest a smile.The Lord replied : This goddess of the Ganges, Ananda, will in a futureperiod, in the starlike aeon, appear in the world as a fully enlightenedTathagata, 'Golden Flower' by name. This is the last time that thisGanges goddess has been reborn as a woman. She will (in her next birth)cease to be a woman and become a man.

Ānanda thought to himself: All those Bodhi-sattvas, great beings, who will be assembled in that Buddha-field shouldbe known as the congregation of the Tathagata?The Lord read the Ven. Ânanda's thought and said to him: So it is,Ānanda, as you say. That assembly of Bodhisattvas, great beings, shouldbe known as the congregation of the Tathagata. In addition, the com-munity of the disciples in the Buddha-field of the Tathagata GoldenFlower will not be bound by any measure, and it will be impossible tomeasure the extent of his community of disciples by saying that thereare so many disciples, or so many hundreds of disciples, or so manythousands of disciples, etc. to: or so many hundreds of thousands ofniyutes of kotis of disciples. All one can say is that these disciples willbe countless, innumerable, and immeasurable. And furthermore, Ananda,in the Buddha-field of the Tathagata Golden Flower, after he has knownthe supreme enlightenment, these faults which have been enumerated inthis Prajnāpāramitā will in no way whatsoever either be or be conceived.Ānanda: Where, O Lord, has that Ganges goddess (first) plantedher wholesome root?The Lord: It was in the presence of the Tathagata Dipankara thatshe planted her wholesome root, raised her thought to the supremeenlightenment, and dedicated that wholesome root to the supremeenlightenment. It was when, aspiring for the supreme enlightenment,she had scattered golden flowers over the Tathagata Dipankara. Thatwas at the same time when I, aspiring for the supreme enlightenment,strewed five lotus flowers over the Tathagata Dipankara, and when thatTathagata, having known that I was endowed with the requisite roots,predicted my future enlightenment with the words : 'You will in a futureperiod become a Tathagata, Śakyamuni by name—endowed withknowledge and virtue, Well-Gone, a worldknower, unsurpassed, tamerof men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord!'Thereupon when she had heard my prediction, that goddess produced athought to the effect that: 'Certainly, like that young man I also wouldlike to be predicted to the supreme enlightenment!'

Training in Skill in Means.Subhuti: How, O Lord, should the Bodhisattva, the great being whocourses in the perfection of wisdom, make a complete conquest of empti-ness, how should he achieve the emptiness-concentration? How shouldthe four applications of mindfulness be developed? How should he gainmastery over the right efforts, how should the right efforts be developed?So with: the bases of psychic power, etc. etc.The Lord: Here, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being who coursesin the perfection of wisdom, should contemplate form, etc. as empty.And he should contemplate in such a way that, when he contemplates,his thought does not get disturbed. With his own thought undisturbedhe does not review his own dharmas. Not reviewing his own dharmas,he does not realise. And why? Because that Bodhisattva, that great being,should train in all dharmas as empty of own-marks, and so he does notbring about the separation of any dharma—either of one who wouldrealise, or of one which would realise, or of one through which he wouldrealise. All these dharmas he does not review.Subhuti: As the Lord has just said: 'empty dharmas should not berealised by the Bodhisattva, the great being.' How then does the Bodhi-sattva, the great being, who has stood in emptiness, realise emptiness?The Lord: When, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being, contem-plates the emptiness furnished with the best of all modes, he does notcontemplate 'I do realise', 'I will realise' or 'I should realise'; he contem-plates : 'I will gain mastery', and not 'I should realise'; he contemplatesthat 'this is the time for effecting complete conquest and not the timefor realization'. Just unconcentrated Bodhisattva, the great being,ties his thought to an objective support. Meanwhile, the Bodhisattva,the great being, does not become destitute of the dharmas which act aswings to enlightenment, but he does not realize the extinction of theoutflows. And why? The Bodhisattva, the great being, becomes endowedwith an exalted cognition, if, having stood in the dharmas which constitutethe wings of enlightenment, he discerns thus: 'This is the time for com-plete conquest, this is not the time for realisation.' That Bodhisattva,that great being who courses in the perfection of wisdom, should surely"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"P 406-407  A AINU   425contemplate : 'For the six perfections is this the time; for the developmentof the applications of mindfulness is this the time, etc. to : for the deve-lopment of the Path, of the concentrations on emptiness, the signlessand the wishless, for the acquisition of the superknowledges, of theconcentrations, etc. to: of the four analytical knowledges. But this isnot the time for the realisation of the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to:of the cognition of a Pratyekabuddha. It is the time for the nonrenuncia-tion of the acquisition of the knowledge of all modes'. It is thus, Subhuti,that the Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of wisdom makescomplete conquest of emptiness; and he dwells in emptiness; and sowith the signless; of the wishless he makes complete conquest and hedwells in the wishless. He develops the holy eightfold path, but he doesnot realize (it); etc. to: he develops the applications of mindfulnessand dwells in them. It is thus, Subhuti, that the Bodhisattva makescomplete conquest of the dharmas which constitute the wings of enlighten-ment, develops them, and dwells through them. But he does not realisethe fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: Arhatship.IV 11,1-10. THE OBJECTIVE RANGE OF SKILL IN MEANS.IV 11,1. THE OVERCOMING OF HOSTILE STATES.Suppose, Subhuti, that there were a man who is a hero, vigorous, ofhigh social position, handsome, attractive, and fair to behold, endowedwith the supreme excellence of loveliness and beauty; in archery he hasgone as far as one could go, he is successful in warding off all manner ofattacks, accomplished in all the sixty-four arts, and foremost in allcrafts. He is dear and pleasant to many. Whatever work he may under-take will win him much gain and honour, and for that reason he wouldbe honoured, revered, and worshipped by the manyfolk. More and morehe would feel ever increasing joy and zest. Taking his parents and childrenwith him on some business or other, he enters on a wild forest. Thefoolish among them would feel terror and hair-raising fear. He, however,would fearlessly say to his family: 'Do not be afraid! I will soon get youout of this fearful wild forest. I will protect you and soon set you free!'If then many unfriendly, destructive, hostile, and inimical forces shouldrise up against him in that wild forest, this heroic man would be endowedwith the power of supreme wisdom. Having taken his parents and childrenout of that fearful forest, having set them free, he will securely and safelyreach a village, city or market town, a country district or a place in acountry district, and will dwell there full of joy and happiness, unhurtand uninjured. Nor does he become angry in his mind with those hostileand inimical beings. And why? Because he is well skilled in all the arts.In consequence he can in that wild forest conjure up forces which are"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"426   AAIV U  P 407-408more powerful than those which oppose him, and all the forces hostileand inimical to him will flee in fright. And thereupon that man willdwell at ease, after he has safely rescued his parents and children. Just so,at the time when a Bodhisattva dwells radiating towards all beings athought of friendliness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and impartiality,he does not on that occasion through the realisation of the signlessconcentration get established on the level of the Disciples or the levelof the Pratyekabuddhas.IV11,2. TO DWELL WITHOUT SUPPORT.A bird on its wings courses in the air and does not fall to the ground.It dwells just in space, just in the air, but it does not stand therein nor doesit get established therein. Just so the Bodhisattva achieves mastery overemptiness and dwells in the emptiness; he achieves mastery over thesignless and dwells in the signless; he achieves mastery over the wishlessand dwells in the wishless. But he does not realise emptiness, thesignless, and the wishless in such a way that, as a result of this realisation,he would fall on the level of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas, withouthaving completed the ten powers of a Tathagata, etc. to: the eighteenBuddhadharmas, the great friendliness and the great compassion. But,having coursed in innumerable Buddhadharmas, he reaches the know-ledge of all modes.IV 11,3. THE CARRYING OUT OF THE VOWS MADE IN THE PAST.It is as with a powerful master of archery, well-trained in archery. Hewould first shoot an arrow upwards and would then by a regular succes-sion of other arrows prevent it from falling down on the ground. In fact,the first arrow would not fall down on the ground until that man woulddecide that it should do so. In order that the first arrow should fall untothe ground, he does not send up the last arrow, with the result that thewhole succession of arrows falls unto the ground. In the same way a Bodhi-sattva, who courses in perfect wisdom and who is upheld by skill inmeans, does not realise that farthest Reality limit until his wholesomeroots are matured in the supreme enlightenment. Only when thosewholesome roots are matured in the supreme enlightenment, only thendoes he realise that farthest Reality limit. Therefore, then, Subhuti, aBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, should thus contemplateand meditate the dharmic nature of these dharmas.IV 11,4. THE SKILL WHICH IS UNCOMMON.Subhuti: A doer of what is hard is the Bodhisattva, if he trains inthis Dharmahood, in the Reality limit, in the Dharma-element, etc. to:in the three doors to freedom, and yet does not collapse midway before"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"P 408-409  AAYVU   Mlhe has known full enlightenment. Wonderful is this, O Lord, mostwonderful, O Sugata!The Lord: For, Subhuti, all beings have not been abandoned by theBodhisattva, the great being. As he has not abandoned all beings, hecan have this extraordinary vow. The Bodhisattva whose thought aspiresthus, 'all beings should not be abandoned, by me they should be setfree', when he proceeds in dharmas which are not, if he aspires to theconcentration of emptiness, the signless, and the wishless, which are thedoors to freedom, the Bodhisattva should at that time be known asendowed with skill in means. But he does not midway realise the Realitylimit, until he reaches the knowledge of all modes.IV 11,5. THE SKILL WHICH IS UNATTACHED.Moreover, Subhuti, when the Bodhisattva, the great being, becomesone who wants to contemplate these very deep stations—i.e. the emptinessof the subject, etc. to: the emptiness of the nonexistence of own-being,the four applications of mindfulness, etc. to: the holy eightfold path, thethree doors to deliverance, his thought should aspire thus: 'For a longtime those beings, through the perception of a self, of a being, etc. to :of one who feels, course in a basis. So that they may forsake the view of abasis, I will, after I have fully known the utmost, right, and perfectenlightenment, demonstrate dharmas.' At that time the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, enters into the emptiness-concentration, a door to freedom,but he does not realise the Reality limit, by the realisation of which hewould attain the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment. At the time when the Bodhisattva, the great being,develops the signless concentration, a door to freedom, at that time heenters the signless concentration, a door to freedom, but does not realisethe Reality limit, by the realisation of which he would win the fruit of aStreamwinner, etc. to: Arhatship, or Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment.Thus, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being, endowed with thisproduction of thought, and with these wholesome roots, does not midwayrealise the Reality limit, nor does he become destitute of the four trances,etc. to: the Buddhadharmas. Thus, Subhuti, does the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, at that time become endowed with all the dharmas whichconstitute the wings to enlightenment. But he does not fail until he fullyknows the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment. The Bodhisattva,the great being, who has been taken hold of by skill in means, grows inpure dharmas and his faculties become keener, unlike those of Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas.IV 11,6. THE SKILL WHICH IS WITHOUT BASIS.Moreover it occurs to the Bodhisattva, the great being: 'For a long"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"428  ^^4 IV 11  P 409-410time those beings have coursed in the four perverted views, in the notionsof permanence, of ease, of loveliness, of self; for their sake I will, whenI have known full enlightenment, demonstrate dharma to the effect thatthey may form the habitual idea that this is impermanent, ill, unlovely,and not-self.' Endowed with this production of thought and with skill inmeans, he courses in the perfection of wisdom. He does not enter on theconcentration of a Buddha before having completed the ten powers of aTathagata, etc. to : the eighteen Buddhadharmas, the great friendliness,and the great compassion. At that time the Bodhisattva develops the doorsto deliverance which consist in the concentration on emptiness, thesignless and the wishless, and enters upon them, but he does not realisethe Reality limit until he fully knows the supreme enlightenment. More-over the Bodhisattva thinks to himself: 'For a long time these beingshave coursed in a basis, i.e. in 'a self, a being, a living soul, etc. to : onewho does, one who feels, one who knows, one who sees'; in 'form','feeling', etc. For them I will act in such a way that, when I have fullyknown the supreme enlightenment, the beings will not have the faultsconnected with assuming a basis.' Endowed with these productions ofthought and with this skill in means, he courses in perfect wisdom anddoes not realise the Reality limit, without first having completed the tenpowers of a Tathagata, etc. to: the great compassion. At that time thedoor to deliverance which consists in concentration on emptiness reachesfor that Bodhisattva the fulness of its development.IV 11,7. THE SKILL WHICH IS SIGNLESS.Moreover the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom, thinks tohimself: 'For a long time these beings have coursed in signs, in the signs ofwomen and man, in the signs of form and the formless. For those beingsI will act in such a way that, when I have fully known the supreme enligh-tenment, they will no more have these faults.' Endowed with thisproduction of thought and with this skill in means, he courses in perfectwisdom and does not realise the Reality limit before he has completed theten powers of a Tathagata, etc. to: the great compassion. When he isendowed with that production of thought, then, at that time the door todeliverance which consists in concentration on the signless reaches forthe Bodhisattva the fulness of its development.IV 11,8. THE SKILL WHICH IS WITHOUT WISHES FOR THE FUTURE.Moreover the Bodhisattva, the great being who courses in perfectwisdom, thinks to himself: 'For a long time these beings, under theinfluence of hopes for the future, have been eager to become Śakras,Brahmas, world guardians or world rulers. They have been eager forforms, etc. For their sake I will, when I have fully known the full enlighten-"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"/MHM11  ^IVll   429ment, demonstrate Dharma to beings to the effect that they see the faultsof having hopes for the future'. When the Bodhisattva, the great being,through these wholesome roots and through this skill in means coursesin the perfection of wisdom, then the door to freedom which consists inthe concentration on the wishless arrives at the fulness of its development.But he does not realise the Reality limit, without having fulfilled the tenpowers, etc. to: the great compassion and until he has fully known thesupreme enlightenment. It is impossible, it cannot be that a Bodhisattva,a great being who courses in the six perfections, in the various kinds ofemptiness, in the four applications of mindfulness, etc. to: in the Buddha-dharmas, and who has made a complete conquest and is thus endowedwith vision and cognition, should fall into the Uneffected, or becomeintimate with what belongs to the triple world. That cannot possibly be.IV 11,9. THE SKILL WHICH IS THE TOKEN OF IRREVERSIBILITY.Moreover the Bodhisattva, the great being, who courses in the dharmaswhich act as wings to enlightenment, and makes a complete conquest,may be asked: 'How can a Bodhisattva, who wants to fully know thesupreme enlightenment, after he has coursed in the dharmas which actas wings to enlightenment and made a complete conquest, manage not torealise emptiness, or to penetrate the Reality limit, with the result that hemight reach the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment? How can he realise emptiness, the signless, the wishless,the Uneffected, nonproduction and nonexistence, and how can hedevelop the perfection of wisdom?' If the Bodhisattva, when thus ques-tioned by Bodhisattvas, would explain that 'just emptiness should beattended to, just the signless, the wishless, the Uneffected, nonproductionand nonexistence should be attended to, and yet all beings should not beabandoned,' then one should know that that Bodhisattva has beenpredicted by the Buddhas, the Lords to the supreme enlightenment.And why? Because he indicates the complete conquest of an irreversibleBodhisattva, great being, declares and exalts it. If a Bodhisattva, whenquestioned, explains that 'not should a complete conquest be made ofemptiness, of the signless, the wishless, the Uneffected, of nonproduction,of nonexistence; but one should make a complete conquest of the dharmaswhich act as wings to enlightenment and one should not hang on to allbeings', then one should know that this Bodhisattva has not been pre-dicted to the supreme enlightenment. And why? Because he does notindicate the complete conquest of an irreversible Bodhisattva, does notdeclare or exalt it; and in consequence the Bodhisattvas, the great beings,should know that that Bodhisattva, having made a complete conquest,has transcended the stage of an irreversible Bodhisattva."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"430  AAIVU  /MilIV 11,10. THE SKILL WHICH IS UNLIMITED IN ITS OBJECTIVE RANGE.Subhuti: Is therein some manner in which a Bodhisattva is irreversible?The Lord: He is irreversible if, having heard the six perfections, heanswers as an irreversible Bodhisattva would. He then should by theBodhisattvas be known as irreversible.Subhuti: There are, O Lord, many Bodhisattvas who course towardsenlightenment, but few only who answer as an irreversible Bodhisattvawould, either on the preparatory or the nonpreparatory stage.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. And why? Because few only are theBodhisattvas who have been predicted to the irreversible stage in whichthis cognition becomes possible.

And when I have woken up to fullenlightenment, I shall demonstrate that all dharmas in the triple worldare like a dream!', then, this also, Subhuti, should be known as theirreversible mark of an irreversible Bodhisattva.V 1,6. THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RECOLLECTION5 BY WHICH HE ABO-LISHES THE STATES OF WOE IN HIS OWN BUDDHA-FIELD.Moreover, Subhuti, how can one discern that in the Buddha-field of theirreversible Bodhisattva, when he has become a fully enlightened Buddha,the three states of woe will in no way whatsoever be? If that Bodhisattva,when he has in ((f. 216a)) his dream seen hellish beings, or animal beings,or beings in the world of Yama,6 turns his mindful attention upon them?and thinks to himself, 'thus will I act, thus will I progress that, when Ihave known full enlightenment, in my Buddha-field these three states of4cāndālamrgajātāni, gcan-gzan khro-bo'i rigs dag; more likely= canda, as in Mhvy.

THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SUCCESS IN THE SUSTAINING POWEROF THE TRUTH, 8 WHEN ONE APPEASES A CONFLAGRATION IN A CITY, ETC.Moreover, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva, a great being, may, either in hissleep or on waking up from it, see a town on fire9 and think to himself,'if I have the attributes, tokens, and signs which I have seen in my dreamor on waking up from it as those with which an irreversible Bodhisattva,great being, is endowed, then, because of this Truth, because of theenunciation of this Truth, let that town fire be appeased, cooled down,and extinguished!' If that fire is then appeased, cooled down, and extin-quished, then one should know that that Bodhisattva has been predictedas irreversible from the supreme enlightenment. If, however, that massof fire, overpowering this anunciation of the Truth, spreads from houseto house, from road to road, if it burns some houses and not others,some roads and not others, then, Subhuti, one should know that theBodhisattva must at some time have heaped up a karma conducive tothe rejection of Dharma by these beings,10 and through that the housesof some of these beings now burn while others do not. It is their karmawhich now matures in this very life; it is the karma left over from therejection of Dharma which now comes to fruition.

Nor shall I not win full enlightenment! Surely, I shall win fullenlightenment!1* There is nothing that the Buddhas and Lords whoreside in countless world systems and demonstrate Dharma have notcognized, seen, known, realized, or fully known. I am sure to win fullenlightenment, for these Buddhas and Lords know my earnest intentionto do so.

But if he departs one shouldknow that the Bodhisattva has had his prediction to full enlightenment.As endowed with these attributes, tokens, and signs should the irrevers-ible Bodhisattva, great being, be known.(Mara's Deeds).1* Moreover, in connection with the sustaining power ofthe Truth, Mara, the Evil One, may approach a Bodhisattva unpractisedin the six perfections, deficient in skill in means, unpractised in the fourapplications of mindfulness, etc. to: in the doors to freedom which consistin Emptiness, the Signless, and the Wishless, and who has not entered on aBodhisattva's specific course of salvation.

And why? As Mara's efforts become ever more forceful andvehement, in the end the ghost will actually be removed by Mara'spower; but the Bodhisattva will think to himself, 'it is through my mightthat that ghost has departed !\\ and will fail to cognize that his departurewas in fact due to Mara's might. In consequence he will despise otherBodhisattvas, deride, mock, condemn, and depreciate them, in the beliefthat he himself has been predicted to full enlightenment by the Tatha-gatas of the past, but those others have not.

This is your name, these the names of your mother,father, brother, sister, friends, relatives, kinsmen, and relations.' Back-wards through seven generations he will recite the names of your parents,and he will tell you the country and region from which you have come,as well as the country, town, or village in which you were born. If theBodhisattva has a dull nature, he will tell him that also in the past he hasbeen dull; if he is keen, he will claim that likewise in the past he was keen.If the Bodhisattva is a forest dweller, or begs his food from door to doorwithout accepting invitations, or wears clothes made of rags taken fromdust heaps, or never eats any food after midday, or eats his meal in onesitting, or lives on alms food,15 or lives in and frequents cemeteries, orlives in an open unsheltered place, or dwells at the foot of a tree, or evenin his sleep remains in a sitting posture, or sleeps at night wherever hemay happen to be, or possesses no more than three robes,16 if he hasfew wishes, is easily contented, quite detached, etc. to: wise, frugal, softin his speech17 or soft in his talk18—in each case Mara will tell him thatalso in the past he has had the same quality.

And to him ((217b)) Mara, the Evil One,will predict that 'when you have known full enlightenment you shallhave this name!' When thereupon that Bodhisattva ponders and reflectson this name, then to him, who is stupid and without skill in means itoccurs that 'just this very name which I thought of in my own mind,just that will be my name when I have known full enlightenment'.

Because what is isolated is not defiled or purified.Emptiness is not defiled or purified. Neither the isolated nor emptinessfully knows the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.

If the Bodhisattva dwells in theseattentions associated with perfect wisdom, he should also preach sermonsassociated with the perfection of wisdom.V2,2. IN ITS DISTINCTIVE OWN-BEING THE GROWTH CONSISTS IN ATTENTIONSTO THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM.When he has preached sermons associated with the perfection ofwisdom, he should dwell in just these attentions associated with theperfection of wisdom, and give no opportunity to other mental activities.Day and night he should persistently dwell in just these attentions asso-ciated with the perfection of wisdom. If a man had newly acquired a veryprecious gem, he would be overjoyed. If he lost it again, he would bemost sad and distressed.

Just so should the Bodhisattva, the great being,recognizing this (perfect wisdom) as a precious jewel, not lack in atten-tions associated with the knowledge of all modes.Subhuti: Since, however, all mental activities are lacking in own-being, are empty of own-being, how then can the Bodhisattva becomeone who is not lacking in acts of attention associated with the knowledgeof all modes? For how can one apprehend the Bodhisattva, his acts ofattention and the knowledge of all modes, in that which is deprived ofthem?48The Lord: If the Bodhisattva cognizes thus : 'devoid of own-being areall dharmas; they have not been made by the Disciples, nor by thePratyekabuddhas, nor even by the Buddhas, the Lords; but just a fact isthe Dharmahood of these dharmas, the established order of Dharma,the fixed sequence of dharmas, the Suchness, nonfalseness, unalteredSuchness, the Dharma-element, the Reality limit', then the Bodhisattvavisamyak-phalavatīm kurvanti.

He is bound to progress tothe Tathagata's grounds of self-confidence and his analytical know-ledges.55 When he thus courses, thus strives, and struggles, then it isquite impossible that the Bodhisattva should not reach the cognition ofthe supremely enlightened Buddhas, the great cognition, the cognitionof the knowledge of all modes.

These qualitiesbelonging to this very life should be expected of the Bodhisattva whocourses in this deep perfection of wisdom.V2,7. THE GROWTH WHICH IN ITS OWN FORM IS THE ABILITY TO OVERCOMEALL MARAS.Thereupon it occurred to the Ven. Ananda: Does this Śakra, Chief ofGods, expound by his own insight1 ° the perfection of wisdom and itsvirtues and advantages or by the Buddha's might?Śakra read his thoughts, and said to the Ven. Ānanda : As the Buddha'smight should this be known when I expound the perfection of wisdomand its virtues and advantages.The Lord: So it is, Ananda, so it is. It is through the Tathagata'smight, it is through His sustaining power, that Śakra, Chief of Gods,expounds the perfection of wisdom, and its virtues and advantages.At the time when, Ananda, a Bodhisattva trains in perfect wisdom,makes endeavours about it and develops it, all the evil Maras in the greattrichiliocosm are in a state of uncertainty, 'Will this Bodhisattva realisethe Reality limit and then reach the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to:Pratyekabuddhahood, or will he know full enlightenment?' Moreover,at the time when the Bodhisattva becomes one who is not without perfectwisdom, Mara, the Evil One, is pierced by the dart of sorrow.11 Moreoverthe Evil Maras will let loose a shower of meteors, so as to generate fearin him, to cow him, to make his hairs stand on end, to discompose hismind, to cause one thought at least to be distracted away from attentionsto the knowledge of all modes.Ānanda: Does then, O Lord, Mara, the Evil One, attempt to hurt allBodhisattvas?The Lord: No, he does not.Ānanda: What kind of persons does he then try to hurt?

And also those who have been seized by uncertaintiesabout this deep perfection of wisdom, and who thought that 'perhapsthis perfection of wisdom is so, perhaps not.' And also Bodhisattvas wholack the good spiritual friend, and who, not seeing him, do not hear thisdeep perfection of wisdom, do not cognize it, and in consequence do notprogress to its Thusness, and do not know how to develop it. And Maraalso has a chance with a Bodhisattva who, being without perfect wisdom,takes hold of what is not the true Dharma. Moreover when a Bodhisattva,being without perfect wisdom, speaks in praise of what is not the trueDharma, then it occurs to Mara, the Evil One: 'One who speaks inpraise of what is not the true Dharma, he is my adherent12 and in him Ihave found an advocate12 among many who belong to the Bodhisattva-vehicle. He will fulfill my intention, which is that those who belong tothe Bodhisattva-vehicle should stand on either of two levels—that of aDisciple or Pratyekabuddha.' What other kind of a Bodhisattva willMara, the Evil One, gain entry to? If a Bodhisattva, when this deepperfection of wisdom is being taught, says, 'Deep is this perfection ofwisdom! What point is there in your listening to it, etc. to : in your studyingit! Even I do not get to the bottom of it. How then can you?', then Marawill gain entry to him. Moreover when a Bodhisattva despises otherBodhisattvas, and thinks, 'I course in the perfection of giving, etc. to:in the perfection of wisdom, but you do not!', then Mara gains entry tohim. Moreover when a Bodhisattva fancies and exalts himself, then Mara,the Evil One, becomes contented, elated, enraptured, he becomes over-joyed, exultant and jubilant, and can gain entry to him. Moreover whenof a Bodhisattva the assumption of a name or clan13 is proclaimed, thenhe may regard that as a sufficient reason to look down on other Bodhi-sattvas, however well behaved and lovely in character14 they may be.He exalts himself and depreciates others. He has not got the qualitieswhich are the attributes, tokens, and signs of irreversible Bodhisattvas.Because he has not got them, he gives rise to defilement, exalts himself anddepreciates others and says: 'In this Bodhisattva-vehicle, in this Bodhi-sattva-clan you do not make such a good figure15 as I do.' So he willcondemn and depreciate those persons belonging to the Bodhisattva-vehicle. Mara, the Evil One, then thinks to himself: 'My realm will notremain empty, but crowded will be the hells, the animal kingdom, ((f.224a)) the world of Yama, and the range of the Pretas'. More and morewill Mara, the Evil One, sustain that Bodhisattva, so that he will in duecourse become a plausible talker.

Whatever deed they may do with their pervertedpersonality17—by body, voice and mind—that will lead them to what isunserviceable, disagreeable, and unpleasant. In consequence the greathells will become crowded, the animal kingdom, the world of Yama,and the range of the Pretas. The realm of Mara will be crowded!' Whenhe considers this sequence of events, Mara becomes enraptured, over-joyed, and jubilant. Moreover, if a person belonging to the Bodhisattva-vehicle disputes with a son of good family, who belongs to the vehicle ofthe Disciples, and claims to be superior to him, then Mara, the Evil One,thinks to himself: 'Surely, this son of good family will keep far awayfrom the knowledge of all modes and will not come near it!' And why?Because these quarrels, fights, battles, and disputes do not lead to theknowledge of all modes, but to the hells, to animal births, to the worldof Yama. Because they are not the way to the knowledge of all modes.Moreover if a person belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvasquarrels, fights, battles, and disputes with someone else who likewisebelongs to that vehicle, then Mara, the Evil One, thinks to himself, 'boththese remain far away from the knowledge of all modes! Both these willnot know full enlightenment!' And why? Because this path, this progresson which the sons of good family have set out leads not to the knowledgeof all modes, but to the hells, the animal world, the world of Yama!Moreover if a Bodhisattva, who has not had his prediction, cherishesmalice for one who has had it, and quarrels, fights, battles, and disputeswith him, then he must put on the armour for as many aeons as he hasproduced in himself those evil thoughts, which cause quarrelling, fighting,battles, and disputes, unless, of course, he has altogether abandoned theknowledge of all modes.Ānanda: Is there an escape from (the aftereffects of) these thoughts,or is he definitely condemned to go on putting on the armour for all thoseaeons?The Lord: I have, Ananda, demonstrated a Dharma which includesthe possibility of escape—for persons of the vehicles of the Disciples,Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas. As to the person who belongs tothe vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, and who quarrels with someone else whoalso belongs to it, or disputes with him, insults, or reviles him; if he doesnot confess his fault, but harbours a latent tendency (to hostility)—of16So A xxiv 419.

But if the Bodhisattva confesses his fault, harbours nolatent tendency (to hostility), effects restraint in future (and reflects):'It is indeed a loss to me and not a gain, that I, who ought to removesuffering from all beings, should, when I am spoken to, answer back;that I, who should be to all beings a bridge across the sea of birth-and-death, should speak unkindly to others and contradict them. This is nothow I should act! I should behave like a senseless idiot or a dumb sheep,and nothing should deflect me from this earnest intention. ((224b)) Whenafter having won full enlightenment I should lead those beings to finalNirvana, yet nevertheless I bear ill will towards them and get angry withthem! I should not bear ill will towards them, should not be angry withthem!' Of such a Bodhisattva I teach the escape, and Mara, the EvilOne, cannot gain entry to him. Moreover the Bodhisattva should have nocommerce with persons belonging to the Disciple-vehicle. But if he does,then he should never bear ill will towards anyone, never get angry withanyone. And why? 'For that is not seemly to me that I should bear illwill towards them or get angry with them. And why? Because when Ihave known full enlightenment I should liberate them from all ills.'V2,8. THE GROWTH WHICH HAS FOR ITS OWN-MARK THE FACT THAT (ABODHISATTVA) TREATS (ALL OTHER BODHISATTVAS) ALIKE, (REVERINGTHEM) AS IF THEY WERE THE TEACHER HIMSELF.Ānanda: How then should a Bodhisattva behave towards personswho belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas?The Lord: As to the Teacher himself. And why? 'For he is my com-panion,18 we have both mounted on the same ship, we should both betrained in the same ways and the same things, i.e. in the perfection ofgiving, etc. to: in the knowledge of all modes'. And he should thinkthat 'he is to me one who shows me the way to the perfect enlightenment'.But if that Bodhisattva should dwell in a contaminated dwelling, withoutattentions associated with the knowledge of all modes, then I shouldnot train therein. But if he should dwell not without attentions associatedwith the knowledge of all modes, then I also should train therein'. Whenhe thus trains, the Bodhisattva, the great being, becomes one who trainsevenly.19l*sahāyaka, grogs.l9samaśikso bhavati, bslab-pa mñam-pa yin no."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57PRACTICESSubhuti: What then, O Lord, is the sameness of the Bodhisattvas, thegreat beings, in which the Bodhisattva should train?The Lord: The various kinds of emptiness1 are the sameness of theBodhisattvas, the great beings.

He doesnot seize on what is unreal or immoral. When he trains thus, the Bodhi-sattva is not reborn among the long-lived gods.9 And why? Because heis endowed with skill in means. And what is that?

When in spite of this fact a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, does not lose heart and remains uncowed, then that is his per-fection of wisdom.

Fewer than the Bodhisattvas who haveset out for full enlightenment are those who progress to Thusness, butmore numerous are those who stand in Discipleship and Pratyekabuddha-hood. Much more numerous than the sons of good family who belongto the Bodhisattva-vehicle and who, dwelling in this deep perfection ofwisdom, are without any doubt bound to enter on the irreversible stage,are those who do not manage to enter on it.

THE GROWTH WHICH IMPLIES THE ACQUISITION OF ALL THE ACCOM-PLISHMENTS.Again, when he trains in this deep perfection of wisdom, the Bodhi-sattva trains in that which is the highest possible degree of perfection forany being. What do you think, Subhuti, if you consider all the beings inthe great trichiliocosm, would they be many?Subhuti: Many, O Lord, many, O Well-Gone! There are many beingseven in Jambudvipa alone, and how many more in the great trichiliocosm!The Lord: If all beings in the great trichiliocosm would sooner orlater, after acquiring a human body, know full enlightenment; and ifone single Bodhisattva, during his entire life were to furnish them allwith robes, almsbowls, lodgings, medicinal appliances for use in sickness,what do you think, Subhuti, does this Bodhisattva on the strength ofthat beget much merit?Subhuti: He does, O Lord. ((f. 226b))The Lord: Much greater merit will that son or daughter of good familybeget who will take up this deep perfection of wisdom, bear it in mind,preach and study it, will wisely attend to it, and who will progress to itsThusness. And why? So greatly profitable is the perfection of wisdom ofthe Bodhisattvas, the great beings, as productive of the supreme enlighten-ment! A Bodhisattva should therefore train in just this perfection ofwisdom if he wants to arrive at the supreme position among all beings, tobecome a saviour of all those who are helpless, a refuge and final reliefto those who so far have found no refuge or final relief; an eye to theblind, a lamp to those plunged into the darkness of ignorance; if hewants to reach Buddhahood, to arrive at the domain of the Buddhas, to^sarva-pāramitānām pāram gantu-kāmena; pha-rol-tu phyin-pa thams-cad-kyi pha-rol-tu'gro-bar' dod-pas.

After having viewed them with his cognition and vision, heshould pass above them, and enter on a Bodhisattva's special way ofsalvation. When he trains thus, the Bodhisattva comes near to the know-ledge of all modes, and will know the supreme enlightenment. He reachesa condition where he becomes worthy of the donations of the worldwith its gods, men and Asuras. He surpasses others who are worthy ofdonations, if they are Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, and he comes nearto the knowledge of all modes.

On the contrary, he does not cognize thisperfection of wisdom; that 'this is the perfection of wisdom, here is theperfection of wisdom', that also he does not cognize or see, or likewisethat 'this one has the perfection of wisdom, by that is the perfection ofwisdom', or 'him who, going forth by this perfection of wisdom, ((f.227a)) comes to know full enlightenment'.

From the isolatedness of spaceshould the isolatedness of beings be seen; from the emptiness of spaceshould the emptiness of beings be seen, from the unsubstantiality ofspace the unsubstantiality of beings, from the vanity of space the vanityof beings. In this way also, O Gods, are doers of what is hard the Bodhi-sattvas, the great beings who put on the armour for the sake of beings whodo not exist. Those who for the sake of beings put on the armour arelike people who would want to dispute with space.

When all dharmas cannot be apprehended, what is the objecthe will realize, what is the dharma he will realize, so that he can know fullenlightenment? This is the Bodhisattva's coursing in the Baseless throughwhich he loses his blindness17 for all dharmas. If, when this is being taught,a Bodhisattva does not despond, or become cowed, or afraid, then, thuscoursing, a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom. He does not, however,review the fact that he courses, nor the perfection of wisdom, nor that hewill know full enlightenment. And to that Bodhisattva who courses inperfect wisdom it does not occur: 'I keep away from the level of theDisciples and Pratyekabuddhas, I am near to ((229a)) the knowledge ofall modes'.V5c,2. THE DISCRIMINATION OF THE LINEAGE.Just, O Lord, as it does not occur to space,18 'I am near this or I am farfrom that'. And why? Because of the unbrokenness of space, its immo-bility, its nondiscriminativeness. Just so it does not occur to theBodhisattva, the great being who courses in perfect wisdom, 'the Disciple-level or the Pratyekabuddha-level is far from me, the utmost, right, andperfect enlightenment is near to me'. And why? Because of the lack ofdiscrimination on the part of the perfection of wisdom.V5c,3. THE DISCRIMINATION OF (THE PROCESS WHICH LEADS TO) FULLATTAINMENT.Just as it does not occur to an illusory man, 'the illusion is far fromme, the conjuror is near to me, again this assembled crowd of people,that is far from me or near to me'.

Because of lack of discrimination on the part of the reflected image.Just so it does not occur to the Bodhisattva, the great being who coursesin the perfection of wisdom, 'the Disciple-level or the Pratyekabuddha-level is far from me, the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment is nearto me'. And why? Because of the lack of discrimination on the part ofthe perfection of wisdom. For, O Lord, to the perfection of wisdomnothing is dear or undear. And why? Because the own-being of thatwhich would be dear or undear cannot be apprehended.V5c,5. THE DISCRIMINATION OF POINTS TO BE SHUNNED AND ANTIDOTES.Just as for the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened One nothingdear or undear exists, just so also for the perfection of wisdom.V5c,6. THE DISCRIMINATION OF ONE'S OWN SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENTS.Just as the Tathagata is one who has forsaken all constructions anddiscriminations, just so has the perfection of wisdom forsaken all con-structions and discriminations, on account of (its) nondiscrimination.V5c,7. THE DISCRIMINATION OF THE DOER.Just as it does not occur to a magical creation of the Tathagata, 'theDisciple-level or the Pratyekabuddha-level is far from me, full enlighten-ment is near to me'.

Therein they will stand, and,having stood therein, they will not move away from that position.V5d,9.

Nor does it occur to the perfection of giving,'I will follow the perfection of wisdom', and so for the other perfections.And why? Because this is their own-being that they are incapable ofdoing anything,25 empty in their own-being, vanities, a mere mirage.Subhuti: If, O Lord, all dharmas are empty of own-being, how thendoes the Bodhisattva, coursing in the perfection of giving, etc. to : in theperfection of wisdom, awake to full enlightenment?The Lord: Here it occurs to the Bodhisattva, who courses in the sixperfections : 'a perverted thought surely is this fabrication of the world.Without skill in means it cannot possibly be set free from birth-and-death; for the sake of these beings I should course in the perfection ofgiving, etc. to : in the perfection of wisdom'. For the sake of these beingshe renounces his inward and outward possessions, but thinks: 'notanything have I renounced'. And why? Because he knows that possessionto be empty of own-being. When he considers thus, the Bodhisattvafulfills the perfection of giving. He also, for the sake of these beings, givesno occasion to immorality. And why? For he thinks to himself: 'thatwould not be seemly for me that I who have set out for full enlightenmentshould take life, etc. to: have false views, or should strive after senseobjects, or the condition of a god or Brahma, or the level of a Discipleor Pratyekabuddha'.

For the sake of those beings he also, while onhis way to full enlightenment, never again becomes lacking in wisdom.And why? For he knows that he could not mature beings except byentering into the perfection of wisdom, and that therefore he should notproduce even one single stupid thought. It is thus that the Bodhisattva,the great being, just for the sake of beings courses in the perfection ofwisdom.Subhuti: If there is no difference between the perfections, how is itthat this perfection of wisdom has been called the foremost of the fiveperfections, the principal, the best, the choicest, the most excellent, themost sublime, the highest, the utmost, the unequalled?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. There is no difference at all betweenthe perfections. But if there were no perfect wisdom, then these fiveperfections would not get the designation of'perfections'. For it is thanksto the perfection of wisdom that they get this designation. Just as, Subhuti,various kinds of bodies, when they have approached Sumeru, the king ofmountains, become of one colour, just so, Subhuti, thanks to the per-fection of wisdom, these five perfections get the designation of'perfections'and when they have entered into the knowledge of all modes, they becomeof one colour, i.e. of the colour of perfect wisdom, and no more distinc-tion between them is conceived, (so that one could say:) 'this is the per-fection of giving,' etc. to: 'this is the perfection of wisdom'. And why?Because they have no own-being—for that reason no distinction (be-tween them) is conceived.Subhuti: If, O Lord, of any dharma which is modelled on an objectiveentity27 no distinction or difference is conceived, how is it that the per-fection of wisdom has been declared to be among the perfections theforemost, the principal, etc. to: the unequalled?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is.

THE DISCRIMINATION OF THE (NON) ADHERENCE TO THAT WHICHBELONGS TO THE TRIPLE WORLD.Subhuti: What is the reason why, not having attended to form, etc.to : enlightenment, he will reach the knowledge of all modes?The Lord: Because through his nonattention he does not cling to theworld of sense desire, the world of form, or the formless world. By thisnonattention he does not cling to anything. It is thus indeed that theBodhisattva, the great being, who courses in perfect wisdom, should notcling to any dharma whatever.V5e,4.

And why? Because the perfection ofwisdom does not settle down in any dharma, nor is it capable of doing so.And why? Because that wherein one could settle down has no own-being.If again the Bodhisattva, the great being, perceives even the perfection ofwisdom, then he has fallen away from it.

For an immea-surable and incalculable performance has the perfection of wisdom of theBodhisattvas, the great beings, been set up. But, although the perfectionof wisdom lends lustre34 to the performance, it does not take hold ofform, etc. to : consciousness. Nor has it been set up for the sake of takinghold of Discipleship or Pratyekabuddhahood, but on the contrary, thisperfection of wisdom is the leader of the Bodhisattva, the great being,to full enlightenment. She does not lead to the level of the Disciples orPratyekabuddhas, but to the acquisition35 of the knowledge of all modes.It is thus that this perfection of wisdom neither produces nor stops anydharma, if the ñxed nature of Dharma is made into the standard.Subhuti: If the perfection of wisdom neither produces nor stops anydharma, how then should the Bodhisattva, the great being who coursesin perfect wisdom, give gifts, how guard morality, etc. to : how developwisdom?The Lord: After he has made the knowledge of all modes into hisobjective support, he should give gifts. Having made these wholesomeroots common to all beings, he should dedicate them to supreme enlighten-ment. Then the six perfections go in him to their full development, andso does the ((f. 246b)) knowledge of all modes. A Bodhisattva, a greatbeing who is not lacking in the six perfections, is also not lacking in theknowledge of all modes. A Bodhisattva, a great being who wants toknow full enlightenment, should therefore train in the six perfections.When he courses in the six perfections, then the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, having fulfilled all the wholesome roots, will reach the knowledgeof all modes. Therefore, then, should the Bodhisattva, the great being,make efforts about the six perfections.V5f,4.

Just so the Bodhisattva, thegreat being who wants to know full enlightenment, should, after he hastrained in the six perfections, help beings with gifts, with morality,patience, vigour, trance, and wisdom, and should liberate them fromthe round of birth-and-death.V5f,7. THE DISCRIMINATION OF THE ABSENCE OF STRIVING.Therefore, then, a Bodhisattva, a great being, who wants to gain astate where he cannot be led astray by others, to purify the Buddha-field,to sit on the terrace of enlightenment, and to turn the wheel of Dharma,should train in the six perfections.Subhuti: You say that he should through perfect wisdom train inperfect wisdom?The Lord: So I do. I say also that he should train in perfect wisdomif he wants to gain the development of sovereignty over all dharmas.V5f,8. THE DISCRIMINATION WITH REGARD TO THE ABSENCE OF A CAUSE.And why? Because this perfection of wisdom through which one gainsthe stage of the sovereignty over all dharmas, is the door to all dharmas.Just as, Subhuti, the great ocean is the door of all rivers, so is the perfectionof wisdom the door to all dharmas.36 Whether persons belong to thevehicle of the Disciples, or to that of the Pratyekabuddhas, or to thatof the Bodhisattvas, they all should train in just this perfection of wisdom.Therefore, then, the Bodhisattva, the great being, should train in the sixperfections ((f. 247a)), etc. to: in the knowledge of all modes.V5f,9.

Because he himself wants to know full enlightenment, andothers also he encourages to full enlightenment, incites them, instigatesthem, settles, and establishes them. It is thus impossible, Ānanda, thatthe Bodhisattva, the great being, coursing in the four applications ofmindfulness, etc. to : the knowledge of the modes of the path, growing inwholesome roots, could fail to win full enlightenment; that cannotpossibly be.When this Perfection of Wisdom was being taught, the Lord in frontof the four assemblies, and of the gods, men, Yakshas, Gandharvas,Asuras, Garudas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas who had gathered aroundHim, exerted his psychic power in such a way that they all saw Aksho-bhya, the Tathagata, surrounded and revered by his congregation ofmonks, demonstrating Dharma to an assembly vast like the ocean14and imperturable15—all of them Arhats, with their outflows dried up,undefiled, fully controlled, quite freed in their hearts, well freed and wise,thoroughbreds, great Serpents, ((f. 235b)) their work done, their taskaccomplished, their burden laid down, their own weal accomplished,with the fetters that bound them to becoming extinguished, their heartswell freed by right understanding, in perfect control of their wholeminds16—and also to the Bodhisattvas, the great beings who had an intelli-gence vast like the ocean. Thereupon the Lord again withdrew thatpsychic power, and in consequence the four assemblies no longer sawthe Tathagata Akshobhya, or the persons belonging to the Disciple-vehicle or the Bodhisattva-vehicle, nor that Buddha-field of the TathagataAkshobhya. That congregation of monks headed by the Buddha nolonger came within the range of their vision. And why? Because theLord, the Tathagata, had withdrawn that exercise of psychic power.That is why they could no longer see it.The Lord: Ananda, do you see that Buddha-field of the TathagataAkshobhya, and that congregation of monks and Bodhisattvas?Ānanda: That Buddha-field, O Lord, does not come within the rangeof the eye, nor that Tathagata, nor that congregation of monks, nor thatcongregation of Bodhisattvas.l4sarvagunaratnākaratvāt sāgaropamā.

(b)rgal). The terminology concerning this samādhisuffers from an embarras de hchesse. P's avaskandaka and Ad's viskandaka both emphasizethe aspect of 'leaping, jumping, skipping'. At P 71, where under the heading of kāyasāksinpart of this samādhi is described, the word avaskandakena is used; S i 273 has instead vw-kadya, rnam-par mnan tin. The equivalent of AdT, thod-rgyal-gyi, also stands for vyut-krāntaka-samāpatti, and at VM xii 2, 5 Buddhaghosa uses the word ukkantika in the senseof 'skipping', 'ueberspringeh1'. Das has rgal, the translation of AK brgal, which Edgertonrather rashly assumes to be the correct form. Both AA and AdT have rgyal, and the notionof 'victory' seems implied (H 888 calls it vaśitva-laksanam). S's vistambhaka appears toexpress a quite different idea, and I would provisionally assume that we have to deal withthe unwarranted correction of a Nepalese scribe. J. May (Hobogirin 356-357) sums up theless detailed account of Kumārajīva's P (T 223 xx 368al2-cl). For some more Chineseequivalents see T 220 cccl, 800-1; T 1509 lxxxi, 630b.The 'concentration which is like the lion's yawn' is the one which the Buddha underwentimmediately before his Parinirvāna (Das Mahāparinirvānasūtra, ed. E. Waldschmidt,1951, pp. 394-397. Buddhacarita xxvi 89-91, trsl. in my Buddhist Scriptures, 1959, p. 63).The 'overleaping samādhC is a method of 'thought-control' (cittam paridametabbam, VMxii 2) and of winning 'mastery over the trances' (AKv'm 174). It is described in AKVm 18-19(quot. H 888), and according to Vasubandhu's commentary, it is the privilege of the Arhatsof the asamayavimukta type, i.e. of those who cannot fall back, and whose deliverancedoes not depend on circumstances. But even they cannot leave out more than one stage ata time. The Bodhisattva, on the other hand, from the 8th stage onwards (ace. to Asanga)can (1) jump from any one stage to any other, and (2) can even from any transic stage directlyreturn into a condition of unconcentrated distraction.The term simha-vijrmbhita-samādhi, above interpreted as the concentration of the lionwho 'yawns', while he frowns and scowls at the same time, can also be understood as theconcentration of the lion who darts, or springs, forward. As we read in a Chinese commen-tary (quot. by J. May, p. 357): 'One says of a lion that he springs forth so as to 1. removethe dust from his coat, and 2. so as to run much faster than the other animals, whether heflees or attacks. Just so this trance springs forth so as to 1. remove the dirt of ignorance,and 2. so that one can enter rapidly and immediately into the higher concentrations, aswell as emerge from them again.'For further information see J.

A Bodhisattva should be trainedin many stations and yet he should not be trained in anything. For thedharmas in which the Bodhisattva should train cannot be apprehended.Subhuti: A Bodhisattva who wants to know full enlightenment should,in what the Tathagata has taught about dharmas briefly and in detail,study those six perfections in brief and in detail. After he has studiedthem he should become thoroughly familiar with them in his speech,and then repeatedly consider them with his mind, but in such a way thatthe dharmas which constitute thought and its concomitants do notproceed.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. A Bodhisattva who trains brieflyand in detail in these six perfections ((f. 247b)) will also cognize all dharmasbriefly and in detail.Subhuti'.

And why? Becausethey have no own-being which could be conjoined or disjoined. Andwhat has no own-being that is a nonexistent, and what is a nonexistentthat is not conjoined with a nonexistent or disjoined from it. Thus shouldall dharmas be cognized. This again is the abridgement for a Bodhisattva,a great being. For in this abridged perfection should a Bodhisattva trainas a beginner and until he has stood on the tenth stage. When he trainsin this abridgement, a Bodhisattva will cognize all dharmas briefly andin detail.Subhuti: Is this an introduction for a Bodhisattva whose facultiesare keen?The Lord: This is an introduction also for a Bodhisattva whosefaculties are dull, or of a medium kind, or unconcentrated. This is anintroduction for any Bodhisattva who wants to train, but not for onewho is lazy, inferior in vigour, confused in his mindfulness, disturbed inhis thought; it is an introduction for one who exerts vigour, who is notlazy, whose mindfulness is well established, and who wants to train onthe irreversible stage and to reach the knowledge of all modes.V6b,3. THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT UPHELD BY THE BUDDHA'S AID.If a Bodhisattva will train in the perfection of wisdom as it has beenexplained, he will, having trained in the perfection of giving, etc. to:the perfection of wisdom ((f. 248a)) reach the knowledge of all modes.Whatever deeds of Mara may arise to a Bodhisattva who courses inperfect wisdom, he will at once get rid of them again. Therefore a Bodhi-sattva who wants to gain skill in means should train in the perfection ofwisdom. At the time when a Bodhisattva courses in the perfection ofwisdom, develops it, and makes endeavours about it, at that time theBuddhas and Lords who reside in countless world systems and demon-strate the Good Dharma, bring that Bodhisattva to mind, as he coursesin perfect wisdom. And why? The past, future, and present Buddhas andLords have issued from the six perfections. A Bodhisattva who coursesin perfect wisdom should therefore expect that also he will reach thosedharmas which the past, future, and present Buddhas and Lords havereached, will reach, and do reach. It is thus that a Bodhisattva who"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"P 466-467  AAV 6   507courses in perfect wisdom should exert effort. When he exerts himself insuch a way, then he will quickly know full enlightenment. A Bodhisattvashould therefore become one who is not lacking in attentions to theknowledge of all modes. If a Bodhisattva, thus coursing in the knowledgeof all modes, develops perfect wisdom even for the time of a mere finger-snap, then he will beget a greater amount of merit than if he were togratify all beings in the great trichiliocosm with gifts, or were to establishthem in morality, in concentration, in wisdom, in emancipation, in thevision and cognition of emancipation, in the fruit of a Streamwinner,etc. to: Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment. And why? Because all these,from giving to Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment, have issued from this(perfect wisdom). Those Buddhas and Lords also, who reside in theworld systems in the ten directions and demonstrate Dharma, they alsohave issued from this perfection of wisdom. All the past, future, andpresent Buddhas have come forth from this perfection of wisdom.Furthermore if, for a second, or a day, or a hundred days, or a year,or one hundred years, or an aeon, or for one hundred aeons, or forcountless thousands of aeons, a Bodhisattva were to develop this per-fection of wisdom with attentions which have the knowledge of allmodes for their objective basis, he will beget a greater merit than onewho were to gratify all beings in world systems equal to the sands of theGanges with gifts, or would establish them in morality, etc. to:in Pratyekabuddha-enlightenment.

Only with reference to suffering do I use verbalexpressions, not for the settling down in name and sign. For a Tathagata,or his disciple, does not settle down in name and sign. If name couldsettle down in name, sign in sign, emptiness in emptiness, the signlessin the signless, the wishless in the wishless, Suchness in Suchness, theReality limit in the Reality limit, the Dharma-element in the Dharma-element, the Unconditioned in the Unconditioned, then the Tathagata,or his disciples, would settle down in name or sign. But since all dharmasare mere words, they do not abide in them. It is thus that a Bodhisattva,having taken his stand on mere words and signs, should course in perfectwisdom, but not settle down in it.Subhuti: If all dharmas31 are mere words and signs, what is the pointof a Bodhisattva's raising his thought to enlightenment, and why shouldhe experience the manifold misfortunes of the karma formations, whygo on the pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva, and give various gifts, guardmorality, etc. to: develop wisdom, course in emptiness, etc. to: fulfilthe great friendliness and the great compassion?The Lord: As Subhuti has asked, 'if thus all dharmas31 are but namesand signs, what is the point of a Bodhisattva's going on his pilgrimage?'It is just because everything conditioned is mere name and sign, andthose names are empty of names ((f. 252b)), those signs are empty ofsigns, that a Bodhisattva, coursing on his pilgrimage, reaches the know-ledge of all modes, and then turns the wheel of Dharma, thereby leadingbeings to Nirvana through the three vehicles. But of that name or signno production, passing away or alteration can be conceived.32V6e,l.

THE BEWILDERMENT CONCERNING ALL-KNOWLEDGE.The Lord: Everything that there is, both inner and outer dharmas,that has been cognized by the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas—but notall the paths, and not in all respects. As Subhuti has asked:V6e,3. THE BEWILDERMENT CONCERNING THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATHS.'For what reason does the knowledge of the modes of the path belongto the Bodhisattvas, the great beings?' The Bodhisattva, the great being,should produce and cognize all paths. The paths of the Disciples andPrâtyekabuddhas, and those of the Bodhisattvas—those paths shouldbe fulfilled, and through them should be done what ought to be done onthem. But the Reality limit should not be penetrated.Subhuti: Why should a Bodhisattva, who ought to fulfil the Buddha-path, not realise the Reality limit V4The Lord: The Bodhisattva should not realise the Reality-limit withouthaving completely purified his Buddha-field and matured beings.35V6e,4. THE BEWILDERMENT CONCERNING THE PATH.Subhuti: Should then a Bodhisattva, having stood in the path, realisethe Reality limit?The Lord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Having stood in the no-path?The Lord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Having stood in both path and nonpath?The Lord: No, Subhuti.Subhuti: Having stood in neither path nor no-path?The Lord: No, Subhuti.&P then adds: \"Subhuti: For what reason does the knowledge of all modes belong tothe Tathagata?- The Lord: As many as there are the modes, tokens, and signs by whichdharmas are indicated, all those modes, tokens, and signs have been understood by theTathagata. Therefore one speaks of a Tathagata's knowledge of all modes. Subhuti: Forwhat reason does all-knowledge belong to the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas?\"—P alsoreverses the order.34or, as AdT seems to take it: If the Bodhisattva should not fulfil the Buddhapath (whichis not mentioned in the above answer), why then should he not just as well realize the Realitylimit?35P adds: \"For that reason one speaks of the Bodhisattva's knowledge of the paths\"."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"p 476-411  AAV 6   519Subhuti: How then can a Bodhisattva actually realise the Realitylimit?The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, have you, by having stood inthe path, freed your thought from the outflows without further clinging?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Or by having stood in the no-path, or in both path and no-path, or in neither path nor no-path?Subhuti: No, O Lord, My thought has not been freed from the out-flows without further clinging in so far as I am one who has stood any-where; but it has been freed in so far as I have stood nowhere.The Lord: Just so a Bodhisattva who has stood nowhere should realisethe Reality limit. And as to the term 'knowledge of all modes', it is throughone single mode that one speaks of that, i.e. through the mode of calm.Moreover, Subhuti, all the modes, tokens and signs ((f. 253a)) by whichdharmas are indicated have been thoroughly understood by the Tatha-gata; therefore one speaks of 'the knowledge of all modes'.Subhuti: Again, concerning the three kinds of omniscience—theknowledge of all modes, the knowledge of the paths, and all-knowledge—is there some differentiation as to the forsaking of the defilements inrespect of them, in the sense that this one has a forsaking with, and thatone a forsaking without remainder?The Lord: There is no such differentiation in the forsaking of thedefilements; but the Tathagatas forsake not only the defilements, butalso the residues connected with them, whereas the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas do not.Subhuti: Have they not (alty. reached the Unconditioned, and canone apprehend a differentiation within the Unconditioned?The Lord: One cannot, Subhuti.Subhuti: If no such differentiation can be apprehended, how is it thatthe Lord has distinguished between those who have forsaken all thedefilements and the residues connected with them, and those who havenot (also forsaken the residues)?The Lord: There are really no defilements, and no residues connectedwith them. But there is on the part of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhasa forsaking of greed, hate, and delusion, though their physical afflictionscontinue to proceed; these are harmful to foolish common people,but not to the Disciples; and the Tathagatas do not have them at all.Subhuti: If, O Lord, nonexistence is the Path, nonexistence is Nirvana,how can one distinguish between Streamwinners, etc. to: Pratyeka-buddhas, Bodhisattvas, great beings, and fully enlightened Tathagatas?The Lord: All these have been brought forth from the Unconditioned36—Streamwinners, etc. to: fully enlightened Tathagatas.Subhuti: Is it, then, perhaps the Unconditioned which causes the36See my Vajracchedikâ, 1957, pp. 98-9."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"520   AAV 6   P Alldistinction between them?The Lord: It certainly does not. Taking language as a standard, onecan talk (of Streamwinners, etc.), but in ultimate reality no such distinctioncan be caused. And why? Because the paths of speech do not lead to anyvalid concept.Subhuti: How can the final limit39 be conceived?The Lord: Having made worldly convention into a standard, onecan conceive of the final limit of those who have cut ofP8 the limit,39but not by way of ultimate reality. Moreover, those whose former limithas been cut off, of them the final limit is conceived.Subhuti: When all dharmas are empty of own-marks, how can oneconceive of a former or a final limit?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti. Since all dharmas are empty of own-marks, one cannot conceive of a former limit; how again of a final limit?That cannot possibly be. But on the other hand, to those beings who donot cognize dharmas as empty of own-marks, just to them it has beenexplained that this is the former, this the final limit. But in dharmaswhich are empty of own-marks no former or final limit can in fact beapprehended. It is thus that a Bodhisattva should course in perfectwisdom in dharmas which are empty of own-marks. He, then, floes notsettle down anywhere, not in inner or outer dharmas, not in conditionedor unconditioned ones, not in those of the Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas.Subhuti: In what sense does one speak of the 'perfection of wisdom'?The Lord: It has reached the highest41 perfection of all dharmas—inthat sense one speaks of the 'perfection of wisdom', ((f. 253b)) Further-more it is through this perfection of wisdom that all Disciples,Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Tathagatas have gone beyond42 alldharmas, do go beyond, will go beyond—in that sense one speaks of'perfection of wisdom'. Moreover in the ultimate sense43 the objectivity44of dharmas is unbroken. Through this perfection of wisdom the Tatha-gatas have not apprehended a Beyond45 in all dharmas—in that senseone speaks of the 'perfection of wisdom'.V6e,5.

It is thus that the Bodhisattva, the great being,should, having relinquished all thought of good57 and evil,58 course inthe perfection of wisdom.Subhuti: For what reason does the perfection of wisdom no good andno harm?The Lord: Because the perfection of wisdom has no effect on the con-ditioned and unconditioned dharmas,59 for that reason ((f. 254a)) itdoes no good or harm to anything.Subhuti: Does, then, the Unconditioned not benefit60 all holy men—the Buddhas and their disciples?The Lord: The \"Unconditioned benefits all holy men—the Buddhasand their disciples.

The Bodhi-sattva, who would wish to reach the knowledge of all modes for the sakeof beings, would be just like a man who would wish to plant a tree inspace when space can give no ground for its support.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is.

And why? For it is thanks to the Bodhisattva that all thehells are cut off, all animal births, all worlds of Yama, £ll untowardmoments and states of woe, all poverty-stricken states, all inferior desti-nies, and the whole world of sense desire, the whole world of form, thewhole formless world.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. Just as a Tathagata should theBodhisattva be known.

Furthermore that Bodhisattva,that great being, coursing in the six perfections, etc. to : in the knowledgeof all modes, gets fully acquainted with the path to enlightenment, andhe cognizes that path to enlightenment as having nonexistence for own-being.

And so everything, including the per-fection of wisdom, him who develops the perfection of wisdom, and thebeings for whose sake he develops it, he does not imagine, does not makeinto a sign, does not attend to by way of existence or nonexistence. Andwhy? Because, if all dharmas are nonexistent,15 then they have not beenmade by the Buddhas, Disciples, or Pratyekabuddhas. For all dharmasare without an agent, devoid of an agent.Subhuti: Are then, O Lord, dharmas devoid of dharmas?The Lord: Yes, they are.Subhuti: If, O Lord, dharmas are devoid of dharmas, how, then, can adharma which is devoid of itself cognize as existence or nonexistence adharma which is devoid of itself? For a nonexistent dharma cannotcognize an existent dharma, nor an existent dharma a nonexistent one,nor a nonexistent dharma a nonexistent one, nor an existent dharma anexistent one. When all dharmas are thus uncognizable, how can it occurto the Bodhisattva, the great being, that there is 'existence' or non-existence'?The Lord: It is on account of worldly convention that the Bodhisattva,the great being who courses in perfect wisdom, points to 'existence' or'nonexistence', and not in ultimate truth.V8,4. THE ERROR WITH REGARD TO THE ULTIMATE AND CONVENTIONALTRUTH.Subhuti: Is again, O Lord, worldly convention one thing, and ultimatetruth another?The Lord: Worldly convention is not one thing and ultimate truthanother. What is the Suchness of worldly convention, that is the ((f.257 a)) Suchness of ultimate reality. It is because perverted beings donot know or see that Suchness, that for their sake the Bodhisattva, thegreat being, points to 'existence' or 'nonexistence' by way of worldlyconvention. These beings moreover perceive the five skandhas as existence,and do not cognize them as 'nonexistence'.

THE ERROR WITH REGARD TO THE MARKS.Subhuti: One should, you say, O Lord, not train in the mark of form,or anything else. If one should not train in the marks of these dharmas,how, then, will the Bodhisattva, the great being, not having trained inthe mark(s) of all dharmas, and in the marks of the conditioned factors,28transcend the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas? How, withouthaving transcended the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas, willhe enter on a Bodhisattva's special way of salvation? How withouthaving entered on a Bodhisattva's special way of salvation will he reachthe knowledge of all modes? How without having reached the know-ledge of all modes will he turn the wheel of Dharma? How without havingturned the wheel of Dharma will he set beings free from Samsāra, by the26rnam-pa thams-cad-du, 'in each one of their modes'.Vkiyatā, ji-tsam-gyis.2iP: samskāra, AdT: 'du-byed."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"544   AA V 8  P 497-498vehicle of the Disciples, the vehicle of the Pratyekabuddhas, or the greatvehicle?The Lord: If any dharma had a mark, then the Bodhisattva, the greatbeing, should train in these marks. But because all dharmas are withoutmarks, immaterial, undefinable, nonresisting, with one mark only, i.e.no mark, therefore the Bodhisattva, the great being, should train neitherin their mark(s)29 nor in their no-mark(s). And why? For it is not so thatthey were formerly without marks and that they got marks later on. Butbecause formerly just as now these dharmas were without marks, there-fore the Bodhisattva, the great being, should not train in their mark(s)or their no-mark(s). And why? Whether the Tathagatas are produced ornot, just so is this unmarked Element established, ((f. 263a))V8,16. THE ERROR WITH REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT.Subhuti: If all dharmas are without marks, without differentiatingmarks,30 how does, on the part of the Bodhisattva, the great being, thedevelopment of perfect wisdom take place? Because, without havingdeveloped the perfection of wisdom, the Bodhisattva, the great being,cannot transcend the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas; andwithout having done so he cannot enter on the Bodhisattva's specialway of salvation; and without that he cannot produce the patient accep-tance of dharmas which fail to be produced; and without that he cannotproduce the superknowledges; and without them he cannot purify theBuddha-field and mature beings; and without that he cannot reach theknowledge of all modes; and without that he cannot turn the wheel ofDharma; and without that he cannot establish beings in the fruits of aholy life, or in the foundations of meritorious action due to giving,morality, and (meditational) development.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. Without marks, without differen-tiating marks are all dharmas.Subhuti: How can with regard to markless dharmas development inperfect wisdom take place?The Lord: A markless development is the Bodhisattva's, the greatbeing's, development of the perfection of wisdom.Subhuti: How then does a markless development of perfect wisdomtake place?The Lord: An undevelopment31 of all dharmas is the development ofperfect wisdom.Subhuti: What is the undevelopment of all dharmas?The Lord: A development of the undevelopment of form is the deve-2î>The Sanskrit has here the singular, the Tibetan the plural.30ra viîaksanā in S and P.

And how has he, by fully knowing them, reached the domi-nion over the range of all dharmas?3The Lord: Here, I, formerly coursing on the Bodhisattva-course,coursing in the six perfection, detached from sense desires, etc. dwell inthe attainment of the first, up to the fourth, trance; but I do not take upthe sign4 of these trances and trance-limbs,5 do not put my mind to thesetrances, do not relish or apprehend them. I enter on these trances asthey are pure in all their modes, and, having activated their karma result,6I incline my thought7 to the realisation of the various wonder-workingpowers, of the cognition of the heavenly ear, of the cognition of others'mental make-up, of the cognition of the recollection of former lives, ofthe cognition of the heavenly eye.

And that Bodhisattva thinks to himself: Just nonexistenceare the Buddhas, the Lords, etc. to: the Stream winners. Whether I will,or will not, know full enlightenment, just nonexistent are all dharmas.When I have known full enlightenment, I should establish all beings whocourse in the notion of the existence (of dharmas) (in the belief) in theirnonexistence. And that Bodhisattva, who has set out for full enlightenmentfor the sake of leading all beings to Parinirvana, exerts himself in thegradual activity, training, and progress in which the Bodhisattvas ofthe past have trained with the result that they have known full enlighten-ment.VI1-6.

The Perfection of Giving.When he courses in the perfection of giving, he himself gives gifts andalso others he establishes in the perfection of giving. And he praisesgiving as well as those others who course in the perfection of giving,one acquiescent. Through those gifts he acquires great wealth, and herenounces and gives his gifts with a heart free from stinginess—food tothose who are in need of food, etc. Through those gifts he guards thatmorality which constitutes an essential portion of his spiritual practices,and he acquires an exalted position as a god or human,... and he acquiresa mass of morality, etc. to: the mass of the vision and cognition of emanci-pation. Tindo wed with this giving he transcends the levels of a Discipleor Pratyekabuddha and enters on a Bodhisattva's certainty of salvation,purifies the Buddha-field, matures beings, and reaches the knowledge ofall modes. It is thus that, through giving, the Bodhisattva's gradualactivity is conceived, his gradual training, his gradual progress. And allthat cannot be apprehended. And why? Because it has no own-being.VI 2. The Perfection of Morality.Moreover the Bodhisattva, from the first thought of enlightenmentonwards, himself courses in the perfection of morality, and establishesothers also in the perfection of morality. He praises morality and alsothose others who course in the perfection of morality, one acquiescent.Through that morality he acquires an exalted position as a god or ahuman, and through it he establishes beings in giving, etc. to: in thevision and cognition of emancipation.

But all that cannot be apprehended. And why? Because it has noown-being.VI7-12. The Six Recollections.Moreover the Bodhisattva trains in the gradual activity, the gradualtraining, the gradual progress. From the first thought of enlightenmentonwards he has, with his attentions associated with the knowledge of allmodes, resolutely believed in all dharmas as having nonexistence forown-being. And he develops the recollection of the Buddha, of theDharma, of the Samgha, of morality, of renunciation, and of the deities.VI7. The Recollection of the Buddha.And how does the Bodhisattva develop the recollection of the Buddha?Here he does not attend to the Tathagata through the skandhas. Andwhy? Because they have no own-being, and what has no own-beingthat is a nonexistent. And why? A nonrecollection and a nonattentionis the recollection of the Buddha.—A Tathagata further should not beattended to through the 32 marks of the superman, nor through hisgolden-coloured body, (nor through the effulgence of his halo or hiseighty minor characteristics). And why? Because the effulgence of hisbody and the minor characteristics have no ownbeing, and what has noown-being that is nonexistent. And why? A nonrecollection and a non-attention is the recollection of the Buddha.—The Tathagata shouldfurther not be attended to from his mass of morality, etc. to : the massof his vision and cognition of emancipation. And why? Because allthese have no own-being, and what has no own-being that is nonexistent.And why? Because the recollection of a Buddha is a nonrecollection and anonattention.—Furthermore the Tathagata should not be attended tothrough the ten powers of a Tathagata, the four grounds of self-confidence,the four analytical knowledges, the great friendliness, the great com-passion, or the eighteen special dharmas of a Buddha.

Because the recollection of the Buddhais a nonrecollection and a nonattention.—Furthermore a Tathagatashould not be attended to from conditioned coproduction. And why?Because it has no own-being and that which has no own-being that isnonexistent. And why? Because the recollection of the Buddha is a non-recollection and a nonattention.—It is thus that the Bodhisattva whocourses in perfect wisdom should attend to the recollection of the Buddha.It is thus that his gradual activity, training, and progress is conceived,and it is by training himself in these that he fulfils by gradual methodsthe four applications of mindfulness, etc. to : the knowledge of all modes,and that through the nonexistence of own-being. He will fully know alldharmas as just nonexistent, and he will with regard to them no longereven have the notion of an own-being.VI8. The Recollection of the Dharma.And how should the Bodhisattva develop the recollection of theDharma. Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, shouldnot attend to wholesome or unwholesome dharmas, to determinate orindeterminate dharmas, to worldly or supramundane ones, to fleshlyor spiritual ones, to holy or unholy ones, to (dharmas) with or withoutoutflows, not to dharmas included in the world of sense desire, in theworld of form, or in the formless world, (nor to conditioned or uncondi-tioned dharmas.) And why? Because these dharmas have no own-being,and what has no own-being that is nonexistent. Because the recollectionof the Dharma is a nonrecollection and a nonattention. Here ... fullyknows, and therein there is not even the notion of the existence of thenotion of an own-being. It is thus that the Bodhisattva who courses inperfect wisdom should develop the recollection of the Dharma.VI9. The Recollection of the Samgha.And how should the Bodhisattva develop the recollection of theSamgha? Here the Bodhisattva, endowed with morality, concentrationand wisdom, emancipation and the vision and cognition of emancipation,should attend to the community of the Lord's disciples, the four pairsof men and the eight great personages through the absence of own-being.And why? Because they have no own-being and are nonexistent. For therecollection of the Samgha is a nonrecollection and a nonattention.It is thus that the Bodhisattva should develop the recollection of theSamgha.VI10.

And why? It is thus that the Bodhisattva should attend tothe recollection of morality, i.e. that there is in it not even the notion ofan own-being.VI11. The Recollection of Renunciation.And how should the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdomdevelop the recollection of renunciation? Here, Subhuti, the Bodhisattvashould, through the nonexistence of own-being, attend to renunciation,be it a renunciation of fleshly things or a renunciation of Dharma. Andwhen he renounces (things) in such a way he should not produce a thoughtthus: 'I give or I do not give. I renounce or I do not renounce.' (Evenwhen he gives up all his limbs he should not produce such a thought).And why? Because all this has no own-being. When he thus courses inthe recollection of renunciation and trains in it, he will gradually advanceup to the knowledge of all modes.VI12. The Recollection of Deities.And how should the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,develop the recollection of the deities? Here the Bodhisattva shouldattend, through the nonexistence of own-being, to those gods who havebeen reborn in the various heavens. And why? Because they have noown-being. And so should those deities be attended to, that there iswith regard to them not even the action of recollection. When he attendsthus the Bodhisattva gradually attends to everything up to the knowledgeof all modes. And also the Non-Returners should be attended to asnonexistent. And why? Because they have no own-being, and what has noown-being that is nonexistent. And so they should be attended to in sucha way that there is with regard to them not even the action of recollection.When he attends thus he gradually attends to everything up to theknowledge of all modes.It is thus that one conceives of the Bodhisattva who attends thus tothe six recollections the gradual activity, training, and method.VI13.

But on the other hand there will be in a future period monkswho belong to the vehicle of the Disciples, or to that of the Pratyeka-buddhas, or to that of the Bodhisattvas, and who will speak thus : If alldharmas are nonexistent in their own-being, who then can be defiledor purified by them? Since these people fail to cognize the defilement orpurification (which these dharmas may cause), they will fail in theirmorality, views, and conduct, and in consequence one must expect themto be reborn in one or other of three places of rebirth—in the hells, inthe animal world, or in the world of Yama.

He gives gifts after having included in that per-fection of giving all the six perfections. And likewise he fulfils all thedharmas which constitute the wings to enlightenment, etc. to : he developsthe path after having included in it all the six perfections. And whyshould that be so? At the time when the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfectwisdom, gives a gift, he does so having stood in a thought without out-flows, and he does not review a sign, i.e. him who gives, him to whom hegives, what he gives, who am I that gives. He gives his gifts with a thoughtfree from signs, without outflows, free from craving and ignorance.He does not review that thought, nor that gift, and so on up to all theBuddhadharmas. Moreover with a thought free from signs he practisesthe other five perfections, as well as the remaining spiritual practices,and in each case he fails to review them and their constituents.Subhuti: How does the Bodhisattva fulfil these spiritual practiceswhen all dharmas are without signs and uneffected? ((f. 269b))The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva gives to all who ask for them giftswith a thought free from all signs—food to those who desire food, drinkto those who desire drink, etc. And if someone who has come along shouldsay to him, 'what is the use of your giving a gift which is no help at all!'then that Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, thinks to himself,\"although those beings do abuse me and say 'what is the use of your givingsuch a trifling 4 gift!'—nevertheless I should give gifts, and I should notnot give them!\" Having made that gift common to all beings, he dedicatesit to the supreme enlightenment. But he dedicates it in such a way that,when dedicating, he does not review a sign, i.e. this is the gift, tohim I give, (by) that I give, or who is it that gives. Or, I dodedicate, to what do I dedicate, wherewith do I dedicate, who is itthat dedicates. He does not review the entity which he would give awayor which, having given it away, he would dedicate to the supremeenlightenment. And why? Because all such entities are empty throughthirteen kinds of emptiness. And when he thus considers whereto hewill dedicate, what he will dedicate and whereby he will dedicate, thenhis dedication will be actually effective.5 Furthermore he matures beingsand acquires a Buddha-field. He fulfils the perfection of giving, etc.to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas. And from the very beginninghe fulfils the perfection of giving without seizing on its reward. Just as theParanirmitavasavartin gods satisfy all their needs by mind alone, sodoes the Bodhisattva. Through that gift he serves upon the Buddhas andLords, he gladdens the world with its gods, men and Asuras, and establi-shes those beings in the triple vehicle through his having taken up that4asthira, - transient = doubtful in value.SP: when he dedicates in such a way, his dedication becomes a nonpoisonous dedication,a dedication to the realm of Dharma."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"558   ,4,4 VIII  P511perfection of giving, as well as through his skill in means. It is thus that theBodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, fulfils the perfection of givingwith a thought free from signs.And how does the Bodhisattva fulfil the perfection of morality! Herethe Bodhisattva fulfils the perfection of morality while coursing inperfect wisdom. He acquires that morality which is holy, without out-flows, which is included within the path, and which is acquired in thenature of things.6 And his morality becomes unimpaired, flawless, pure,untarnished, something which sets free (from the slavery of craving),which it is good to concentrate upon, and which has been lauded by thewise.7 And in respect of that morality he does not misconstrue anydharma, from form ((f. 270a)) to the achievement of world rulership.But, having made this morality common to all beings, he dedicates it tothe knowledge of all modes, by way of a dedication which is signless,baseless and nondual, and which is also by way of worldly conventionand not by way of ultimate reality. And through having fulfilled thatperfection of morality, he produces through his skill in means the fourtrances, without wishing to enjoy their fruits. He further achieves theheavenly eye. With that heavenly eye, relating to moral discipline,8 hesees the Buddhas and Lords who in all the ten directions stand, hold,and maintain themselves, and who demonstrate Dharma. And he doesnot lose that vision before he has known full enlightenment. With theheavenly ear, pure and surpassing that of men, he hears the words ofthose Buddhas and Lords when they preach (the doctrine). And he doesnot forget what he has heard before he has worked, as a result of what hehas heard, the weal of himself and of others. With the cognition of others'mental make-up he wisely knows with his own mind the mental processesof those Buddhas and Lords, and with the help of that cognition ofothers' mental make-up he works the weal of all beings. With the helpof the recollection of former lives he appraises the past merits of thosebeings, and through those meritorious deeds he (still further) encouragesthose beings, with the result that they become people of specific attain-ments).9 With the cognition of the extinction of the outflows heestablishes beings in the fruits of the holy life, from that of a Streamwinnerto the supreme enlightenment. In fact he establishes beings in wholesomedharmas in accordance with their capabilities. It is thus that the Bodhi-sattva fulfils the perfection of morality with a mind free from signs.And how does he fulfil the perfection of patience, when dharmas aresignless, impassive, baseless, and uneffected?

In fact, the Bodhisattva shoulddevelop two kinds of patience. Which two? He should endure of allbeings the abuse and revilings,10 as well as the blows with clods, sticks,and swords; and he should also produce the patient acceptance of dharmaswhich fail to be produced. As to the first, the Bodhisattva should, whenabused or reviled, or when he receives blows with clods, sticks, or swords,reflect as follows: who is it that abuses or reviles me, or gives me blowswith clods, sticks, or swords? And to whom does he give these? Heshould contemplate the own-being of (all) dharmas and, when he doesso, he apprehends not even dharmas, how much less the own-being ofDharma itself, ((f. 270b)) And when he contemplates the own-being ofDharma, he thinks to himself: who cuts or breaks me? When he con-templates the own-being of Dharma in this manner, then he acquiresthe patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced. And whatis the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced? It isof two kinds: The one results from the nongenesis of the defilements,and the other from the noncutting off of cognition.

Having stood in these dharmas whichare holy, without outflows, supramundane, not shared by all the Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas, he fulfils at the same time the holy superknow-ledges. When he has fulfilled them he reaches the fulness of the six per-fections. And when he has stood in the five superknowledges which arewithout outflows, then he sees with his heavenly eye, in all the ten direc-tions, the Buddhas and Lords, and as a result he acquires the recollectionof the Buddhas. And that Buddha-recollection of his will not be cut offagain before he knows full enlightenment. With the heavenly ear helearns all that these Buddhas and Lords have taught, and he thereuponteaches beings the Dharma just as it is. And he will understand with hisown mind the mental processes of these Buddhas and Lords.

It is thusthat the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom fulfils the perfectionof patience.How then does the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom fulfilthe perfection of vigour, although dharmas are signless, impassive,baseless, nonmanifest, and uneffected? Here the Bodhisattva, who coursesin perfect wisdom, becomes endowed with physical vigour. He dwellshaving entered upon the four trances, one after the other. When he hasachieved the fourth trance he experiences manifold wonderworkingpowers, etc. to: with his hands he handles even the sun and moon, andup to the world of Brahma he holds sway with his body. Endowed withthis physical vigour he travels, by means of his wonderworking powers,to the many hundreds of thousands of world systems in the ten directionswhere the Buddhas and Lords dwell, and he serves upon those Buddhasand Lords with robes, almsbowls, etc. And his robes, almsbowls, etc. willnot get exhausted before he knows full enlightenment. And when hehas won full enlightenment, then the world with its gods, men and Asuraswill become happy through these robes, almsbowls, etc. And when hehas entered final Nirvana his relics will be worshipped. Having travelled(to other world systems) by means of his wonderworking powers, hehears the Dharma from those Buddhas and Lords, and before he winsfull enlightenment he will never again forget what he has heard. And hematures beings and acquires a Buddha-field, while coursing in the know-ledge of all modes. It is thus ((f. 271a)) that the Bodhisattva, endowedwith physical vigour, fulfils the perfection of vigour.And how, then, does the Bodhisattva fulfil the perfection of vigourwhen he is endowed with a mental vigour which takes place on the holyPath without outflows and is included in the Path? Here the Bodhisattva,who courses in perfect wisdom and is endowed with mental vigour,gives no opportunity to unwholesome deeds of body or speech.12 Hedoes not misconstrue anything whatsoever as 'permanent' or 'imper-manent', 'ease' or 'ill', 'self or 'not-self, 'conditioned' or'unconditioned',—be it the world of sense desire, the world of form or the formless world;the element with outflows or the element without outflows; or the transicconcentrations; or friendliness, compassion, sympathetic joy or impar-tiality; or the formless concentrations; or the applications of mindfulness,etc. to: the Buddhadharmas. Nor does he misconstrue the fruits of theholy life, from the fruit of a Streamwinner to Bodhisattvahood, as'permanent' or 'impermanent', etc. and he does not (mistakenly say)that these beings have been exalted by Vision, those by the stage of refine-12.P, but not Ad, either Sanskrit or Tibetan, adds: deeds of mind."},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"P 513-514  AAVIW   561ment, those by the removal of the lower fetters, those by the removal ofthe higher fetters, those by Pratyekabuddhahood, or by the knowledgeof the modes of the path or by the knowledge of all modes. And why?Because there does not exist the own-being of all these (states) by whichthey (the beings) could be exalted. Endowed with this mental vigour evenat the time of his dying he works the weal of beings, but without appre-hending them. He fulfils the perfection of vigour, but does not apprehendit. He fulfils the Buddhadharmas, but does not apprehend them. Hepurifies the Buddha-field, but does not apprehend it. Endowed withthis physical and mental vigour he fulfils all the wholesome dharmas,but does not cling to them. Not clinging to them he passes on fromBuddha-field to Buddha-field, and works the weal of beings. He worksmiracles with the help of whichever wonderworking powers he desires touse—whether it be a rain of flowers, or an emission of scents, or by songsand music, or an earthquake, or the splendour of his appearance, or adisplay of a world system made up of the seven precious things, or whetherhe sacrifices himself for the sake of those who want to regain their youth,or of those who are blind to the light, or whether he discharges scents,or bestows great oblations—but without taking any life in the process—or introduces countless beings to the Path, etc. to: whether he inducesthem to desist from the taking of life, etc. to : whether he frees them fromwrong views. Some he helps by giving, others by morality, for the sake ofothers again he renounces all his limbs. To some he gives sons anddaughters, and to others a kingdom. For the sake of others he sacrificeshimself. In this way he works the weal of beings by whatever device itcan be worked. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom and is endowed with mental vigour, fulfils the perfection ofvigour even though dharmas be signless.And how does the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, fulfilthe perfection of meditation, in spite of the fact that he has stood in dharmasas nameless and signless? Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, fulfils all the concentrations, with the exception of that of theTathagata. ((f. 271b)) Detached from sense desires and other evil andunwholesome dharmas he dwells as one who has entered on the firsttrance, which is with applied and discursive thought, born of detachment,full of rapture and ease. And so for the other trances.13 He dwells as onewho has irradiated the entire world with a mind associated with friendli-ness, etc. to : with impartiality, etc. to: he dwells as one who has enteredon the station of neither perception nor nonperception.

He dwells as one who has entered on the unimpe-ded concentration, the concentration which is like lightning, the rightconcentration, and the adamantine concentration. Having stood in thisperfection of meditation he dwells as one who has entered the thirty-seven dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment. Having stood inthis perception of meditation with the help of the cognition of theknowledge of the modes of the path he sees that all concentrations areincluded in the knowledge of the modes of the path, he transcends thestage of bright insight, the stage of becoming one of the clan, the eighth-lowest stage, the stage of vision, the stage of the attenuation of the defile-ments, the stage where one is without greed, the stage of a Pratyeka-buddha, and then moves into a Bodhisattva's certainty of salvation andfulfils the stage of a Buddha. And although he courses in these stages,he does not midway attain their fruit14 before he reaches the cognitionof the knowledge of all modes. Having stood in this perfection of medi-tation, he passes on from Buddha-field to Buddha-field, honouring theBuddhas and Lords. He honours those Buddhas and Lords, plantswholesome roots in their presence, matures beings and purifies theBuddha-field. He passes on from world system to world system and worksthe weal of beings. Some he wins over with gifts, etc. to: some with thevision and cognition of emancipation. Some he establishes in the fruitof a Streamwinner, etc. to: some he establishes in (full) enlightenment.By whatever wholesome dharmas the beings may be lifted up, just thosehe enjoins on them. Having stood in this perfection of meditation, heconsummates all dharani-doors, and acquires the four analytical know-ledges. And he becomes a recipient of the superknowledges which areborn of karma result. Never again is he born in the belly of a mother andnever again does he pursue sense pleasures. There is no kind of rebirththat he does not take up,15 though he is not polluted by the faults (whichare apt to attend a) rebirth. And why? Because he has well seen that alldharmas are like a magical illusion. Having known that all conditionedthings are like a magical illusion, he works the weal of all beings without,however, apprehending therein any beings or the concept of a being.Himself nonapprehending he establishes beings in the baselessness of alldharmas—though on account of worldly convention and not in ultimatereality. Having stood in this perfection of meditation, he courses in all thetrances, emancipations, concentrations, and meditational attainments,and he will never again be lacking in the perfection of meditation untilthe time that he wins the supreme enlightenment.

The Single Instantaneous Reunion with Regard to AH Dharmaswithout Outflows Which Have Reached the State Where Their KarmaResult Has Matured.And how does the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, amongsignless dharmas go to the fulfilment of the development of the perfectionof wisdom? Here ((f. 272a)) the Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom does not review any dharma as truly real, or as totally real.But he does not review that true or total reality with regard tothe skandhas; nor does he review their production, the door of theirarrival, or their heaping together. And so on, until we come to : he does notreview the door of arrival of all dharmas with and without outflows, buthe reviews them as just vanities or nullities. And when he considers thushe does not apprehend the own-being of any dharma. Coursing in perfectwisdom he firmly believes that all dharmas have nonexistence for own-being. Having firmly believed that, he courses in the emptinesses, anddoes not settle down in any dharma whatsoever. Coursing in a perfectionof wisdom which is nonexistent in its own-being he fulfils the path of aBodhisattva, i.e. the six perfections, etc. to: the eighty minor characteris-tics. Having stood in the path to enlightenment which has the nature ofbeing a karma result, when he has fulfilled the six perfections, the thirty-seven wings to enlightenment, and the superknowledges which are bomfrom karma result, he helps with gifts those beings who should be helpedwith gifts. And so he helps them with morality, patience, vigour, con-centration, wisdom, emancipation, and the vision and cognition ofemancipation. He establishes in the fruit of a Streamwinner those whoshould be established in the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: he establishesin (full) enlightenment those who should be established in full enlighten-ment. And so all this should be done in full detail. Working miracles withhis manifold wonderworking powers he travels to world systems numerousas the sands of the Ganges, and he conjures up all those precious thingswhich he planned to produce. Fulfilling the intentions of beings ((f. 272b))he passes on from Buddha-field to Buddha-field. When he has seen thoseworld systems, he acquires the Buddha-field which he wishes to acquire,—and therein there will be all the enjoyments and their objects whichare found among the gods who hold sway over (the enjoyments) magicallycreated by others, or which can be had in other Buddha-fields withouthaving to strive for them. Through those karma-resultant six perfections"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"564   AA VII2  P 516-517and superknowledges, as well as the path to enlightenment which is bornof karma result, he attains, coursing in the knowledge of the modes ofthe path, the fulfilment of all dharmas and will reach the knowledge of allmodes. And so on, if all dharmas have not been taken hold of, then forsomeone who has known the supreme enlightenment all the enjoymentsand objects of enjoyment in this Buddha-field will be something that hehas not taken hold of. And why? Because all dharmas have not beentaken hold of, on account of their baselessness. And he teaches theDharma to beings so that they may not take hold of any dharma. It isthus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, fulfils theperfection of wisdom by way of signlessness."},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 72EXPOSITION OF MARKLESSNESSVII 3. The Single Instantaneous Reunion, Which Sees All Dharmas asDevoid of Marks.Subhuti: How can there be a fulfilment of the development of the sixperfections if all dharmas are undifferentiated, signless, and empty ofown-marks? How can one conceive of a difference between those dharmaswhich are with and those which are without outflows? How can one forma concept of (the difference between) these dharmas with their distinguish-ing marks when in fact they have one mark only, i.e. no mark?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,having stood in the conviction that the five skandhas are like a dream,an echo, an image, a mirage, a magical illusion or an apparition, practisesthe five cardinal virtues. (For) the five skandhas are like a dream, animage, a mirage, a magical illusion, an apparition, and devoid of marks.And why? Because a dream has no own-being, nor has an echo, etc.And that which has no own-being, that has no mark. That which has nomark, that has one mark only, i.e. no mark. By this method also oneshould know that the gift is without mark, and so is the giver and recipient.One who gives gifts after having cognized this, fulfils the perfection ofgiving, but does not turn away ((f. 273a)) from the other five perfections.Having stood in these six perfections, he fulfils the four trances, etc.to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas. Having stood in these dharmaswithout outflows which are born of karma result he travels to the worldsystems in the ten directions with the help of his wonderworking powers,and there honours and serves the Buddhas and Lords. And so on, untilwe come to: he works the weal of beings by helping them in every way.He wins over by gifts those who should be won over by gifts, etc. to: hewins over by all wholesome dharmas those who should be won over byall wholesome dharmas. Endowed with these wholesome roots he accepts\"ebirth in Samsāra, as one who is a sovereign over all dharmas, but he isnot contaminated by the sufferings which pertain to Samsāra. For thesake of beings he accepts rebirth in the (relatively) prosperous conditionof gods and men, and that enables him to win over beings. He cognizesall dharmas as without marks, and also cognizes the fruit of a Stream-winner, but does not take his stand on it. And so on up to the enlighten-ment of a Pratyekabuddha. And why? Because, when he has cognized"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"566   ,4,4 VII3  P 518-519all dharmas, he should reach the knowledge of all modes which is notshared by any of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas. It is thus that theBodhisattva, having cognized all dharmas as without marks, cognizesthe six perfections, etc. to: all Buddhadharmas as without marks.Moreover, the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, having stoodin the conviction that the five grasping skandhas are like a dream, etc.to: like an apparition, fulfils the perfection of morality. Having cognizedthe five grasping skandhas as like a dream, etc. to: like an apparition,he fulfils the markless perfection of morality, which is unimpaired,flawless, unspotted, pure, untarnished, which sets free (from the slaveryof craving), which has been lauded by the wise, which one has well takenupon oneself, and which is holy, without outflows, included within thePath and supramundane.i Having stood therein he guards the morality(1) which consists in the (verbal) intimation that one has undertaken toobserve the moral precepts,2 (2) which is acquired in the nature of things,3(3) which is due to restraint,4 (4) which is announced5 ((f. 273b)), (5)which is habitual,6 and (6) which is nonhabitual.7 Endowed with thesekinds of morality he does not misconstrue (the situation by thinking)8:through this (practice of morality) I shall be reborn in good warriorfamilies, or in good Brahmin families, or in the families of wealthy house-holders, or as a universal monarch, or as the commander of a fort, oramong the gods; or, alternatively, I shall win the fruit of a Streamwinner,etc. to: enlightenment. And why ? Because all dharmas are without marks,with one mark only, i.e. with the mark of having nonexistence for theirown-being. And a markless dharma cannot win a markless dharma. Noricf. f. 269.2i.e. one verbally makes a promise, or takes a resolution, to the effect that 'I will not doeither this or that'.3Here there is no deliberate resolution, but morality arises spontaneously or automaticallybecause (1) by dissociating oneself from the defilements of the world of sense desire, onetakes hold of a state of concentrated trance in which taking of life, etc. becomes quite outof the question, or (2) because by abstaining from certain actions one enters upon thePath.—One may compare Atthasālinī p. 103, where there is mention of an abstention dueto a definite undertaking (samādānavirati) as distinct from an abstention due to cuttingoff those factors which make for evil deeds (samucchedavirati).4\"Restraint is that which destroys or arrests the flow of immorality\" (Abhidharmakosa-bhāsya, ed.

Prof. Lamotte tells me that he has notfound this or the following term in his sources, and he believes that they refer to two stagesof sanctity (āryatva) —in the first morality still requires an effort, while in the second itdoes not.

Nor can dharmas which are markless and without distinguishingmarks attain dharmas which are markless and without distinguishingmarks. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, fulfilsthe markless perfection of morality and then enters on the Bodhisattva'sway of certain salvation. Thereafter he acquires the patient acceptance ofdharmas which fail to be produced. He courses in the knowledge of themodes of the path, acquires the five superknowledges which are born ofkarma result, establishes himself in the five hundred dharani doors andthe five hundred concentration doors, and acquires the four analyticalknowledges. Thereafter he passes on from Buddha-field to Buddha-field,honours the Buddhas and Lords, matures beings and acquires a Buddha-field (for himself). He wanders about in the world of birth-and-death withits five places of rebirth, but he is not contaminated by the karma whichis bound up with the world of birth-and-death or by its results. Just as amagical creation walks about, stands, sits, and lies down, though itscoming is not observed (as a real fact) nor its going, nor its standing,sitting, or lying down, just so he works the weal of beings, but does notapprehend a being or the concept of a being. Just as the Tathagata whohas won full enlightenment, after he has known full enlightenment,(has) turned the wheel of Dharma and led countless beings to Nirvanathrough the two vehicles, does not apprehend any Bodhisattva whom hemight have predicted to the supreme enlightenment. Having let go thefactors which make for a long life, he has entered Nirvana which leavesnothing behind after he has conjured up a magical creation. And thatmagical creation, after he has predicted (the enlightenment of) thatBodhisattva after an aeon has elapsed, wins final Nirvana through thesupreme enlightenment. But one cannot apprehend any entity in himwho has won final Nirvana, i.e. none of the skandhas. It is thus that theBodhisattva works the weal of beings, although he does not apprehenda being or the concept of a being. In this way the Bodhisattva, who coursesin perfect wisdom, fulfils the perfection of morality, and in its fulfilmentall dharmas are contained.Moreover the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, havingstood in the conviction that the five grasping skandhas are like a dream,etc. to: are apparitions, fulfils the markless perfection of patience. Andhow does the Bodhisattva, having stood in markless dharmas, fulfil theperfection of patience? Here he fulfils the perfection of patience by wayof two kinds of patience. Which two ? The patience which means tolerationand the patience which can look through to dharmas.9 What, then, is thepatience which means toleration?

And he should think that 'when Ihave taken hold of these skandhas I have taken hold of what are deadlyenemies'. When, as he thus reflects, he becomes full of friendliness andcompassion, then one speaks of the patience which means toleration.And what is the patience which can look through to dharmas? It consistsin that he does not apprehend even those beings in the ultimate sense,(and so he asks himself:) who abuses or reviles me, who uses towards memendacious or harsh words, or who gives me blows with clods, sticks, orswords?

This is called the patience which can look through to dharmas.When he considers thus he fulfils the perfection of patience and when hehas done so, he acquires the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail tobe produced.Subhuti: What is this patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to beproduced? What is its definition,10 and what is its cognition?The Lord: Even the least (anu) dharma is not produced, and that iswhy one speaks of what fails to be produced (anutpattikam). And here thecognition is called patient acceptance, and through that cognition heacquires the patient acceptance of dharmas which fan to be produced.Subhuti: Is there any difference between the patient acceptance ofdharmas which fail to be produced on the part of the Disciples andPratyekabuddhas on the one side and on the part of the Bodhisattva onthe other?The Lord: What is the cognition and forsaking of the Streamwinner,etc. to: the Pratyekabuddha, that is (part of) the Patience of the Bodhi-sattva. And this is the difference between the Patience of all the Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas and that of the Bodhisattvas; that the Bodhisattva,who is endowed with this suchlike Patience, surpasses all the Disciplesand Pratyekabuddhas, for, when he has stood in this Patience, in thepatient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced, he courses in10Lit.

He becomesone who is not lacking in the five superknowledges, and so he can maturebeings and purify the Buddha-field. As a result he reaches the knowledgeof all modes through the wisdom which is conjoined with one singleinstant ((f. 274b)). It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, fulfils the markless perfection of patience.Moreover the Bodhisattva, having stood in the five grasping skandhasas like a dream, etc. to : like an apparition, and as without marks, exertsphysical and mental vigour. He aspires for enlightenment with his physicalvigour in that he travels to the world systems in all the ten directions,honours the Buddhas and Lords, and works the weal of beings. Withthe help of his physical vigour he matures beings, exhorts them to thetriple vehicle and establishes them therein. It is thus that the Bodhisattvawho courses in perfect wisdom fulfils the markless perfection of vigour.With a mental vigour which takes place on the path which is withoutoutflows and which is included in that Path he fulfils the perfection ofvigour in which all wholesome dharmas are included. When the Bodhi-sattva courses in them, he should fulfil the knowledge of all modes, andby fulfilling that he will forsake all the defilements together with theirresidues, and in consequence he will fulfil the full complement of themarks, accomplish the state of having a halo all round, and turn thewheel of Dharma, with its twelve aspects and its three revolutions.

And why? Because he cognizes those concentrationsas markless, and as having nonexistence for their own-being. How can amarkless dharma relish a markless dharma? Not relishing them he willnot gain a new rebirth through any of these concentrations, be it in theworld of form or the formless world. And why? Because he does notapprehend those two worlds, nor him who enters (on concentration),or whereby he enters (on concentration). Not apprehending these hefulfils the markless perfection of meditation, and through that perfectionof meditation he transcends the level of the Disciples and Pratyeka-buddhas.Subhuti: How does the Bodhisattva, who has fulfilled the perfectionof meditation, transcend the level of the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva has been well trained in the variouskinds of emptiness. But in all these emptinesses no dharma can be appre-hended on which he could take his stand, be it the fruit of a Streamwinner,etc. to : the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha.

The 'certainty', on the other hand,consists in that those dharmas—i.e. form, etc. to : the knowledge of allmodes, are not apprehended as a subject of verbal communication.And why? Because the own-being of form, etc. is incommunicable bywords. This is the Bodhisattva's 'certainty'. When he has entered on this'certainty', the Bodhisattva fulfils all the concentrations, but he is notreborn as a result of them.

But Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and Tathagatas do not see adream or one who sees a dream, etc. to: they do not see an apparition orone who sees an apparition. And why? Because all dharmas have non-existence for their own-being, and they are the same as final Nirvana,because of their unreality. Not totally real are all dharmas, because theyhave not actually come into being. It is quite impossible that a Bodhi-sattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, should become one who has thenotion of an existent, or of something totally real, or of something trulyreal. That would not be the perfection of wisdom if one were to appre-hend the own-being of any dharma whatsoever, or its total reality, or itstrue reality. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,does not cling to form, etc. to : the five perfections. When he has stood inthis perfection of wisdom, he fulfils the ten stages, without producingtowards them passionate greed. And why? Because he does not appre-hend those stages; how, then, can he produce passionate greed towardsthem?

But all these dharmas are nonentitiesand have nonexistence for ownbeing. You therefore perceive skandhas,elements, and sense fields where there are none. In fact all these dharmasare due to conditioned coproduction, they have originated from theperverted views, they have been taken hold of as the result of karma.How, then, is it that you become perceivers of entities with regard todharmas which are nonentities! It is thus that the Bodhisattva, whocourses in perfect wisdom, by his skill in means turns niggardly beingsaway from their niggardliness, and exhorts them to the perfection ofgiving. And to them the giving of gifts becomes conducive to great wealth.Having moved them away from this,2 he exhorts them to the perfectionof morality, and their taking morality upon themselves becomes conduciveto their being reborn in heaven. Having moved then away from this,3he exhorts them to transic concentration which in its turn is conduciveto their rebirth in the Brahma-world. And so he exhorts them to thevarious trances, from the first trance to the attainment of the station ofneither perception nor nonperception. He then dissuades them in variousways from those inferior things, like giving, morality, and concentration,and from their fruits, and encourages them to win the realm of Nirvanawhich leaves nothing behind, exhorts them to it and establishes them init.

And when, Subhuti, you consider this wonderful and astonish-ing dharma of a Bodhisattva, (you must admit that) it is not easy for allyou Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas to repay the Bodhisattva (for hisfavours). All of you cannot possibly surpass this dharma of a Bodhi-sattva.Subhuti: What, then, is this (wonderful and) astonishing dharma of aBodhisattva which does not exist for all the Disciples and Pratyeka-buddhas?The Lord: Therefore, then, Subhuti, listen and attend well, I willexplain this to you! Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,having stood in the six perfections born of karma result, in the fivesuperknowledges, etc. to: in the eighteen special Buddhadharmas, andhaving travelled to the world systems in the ten directions, helps beingswith what they require, whether it be gifts, morality, etc. to: the con-centration on emptiness, the signless, the wishless.Subhuti: How does the Bodhisattva help beings by giving?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,gives gifts—food to those in need of food, etc. to: anything else that maybe useful to human beings. And just as he gives to the Tathagata, soalso to Pratyekabuddhas, Arhats, etc. to: Streamwinners, to those whoare reborn in the right places of rebirth and to those who progress in theright direction, so he gives to humans and to those who are rebornas animals; to all he gives gifts after he has formed the notion of non-differentiation. And why? Because he has cognized all dharmas asbeing just one undifferentiatedness. Having given gifts without differen-tiating, he becomes the recipient of an undifferentiated dharma, i.e.the knowledge of all modes. But if a Bodhisattva, when faced with((f. 277b)) a living being in the animal world who does not seem worthyof gifts, should produce a thought to the effect that 'a fully enlightenedBuddha is worthy of my gifts, but not this animal', then he does not havethe dharma of a Bodhisattva. And why? Because the Bodhisattva, whohas raised his thought to enlightenment, has not set out for the supremeenlightenment with the reflection, 'these beings I should help with gifts,but not those'. Helped by gifts they will be reborn in good families, andin due course they will, by means of the three vehicles, enter into therealm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. If all people taken togethershould plan to kill the Bodhisattva, his thought should remain unaltered,he should not think 'should I give to them or should I not?', but withunshaken mind he should resolve to give gifts to just those people.

And why? Because that Bodhisattva has taken hold ofhis bodily basis deliberately for the sake of beings, and with the intentionthat through his physical personality the welfare of beings should beworked. And he should produce a thought thus, 'may those people forwhose sake I have appropriated this physical personality go away satisfiedwhen they have received everything without having solicited for it!'And it is thus that the Bodhisattva should train in perfect wisdom.—Moreover, when the Bodhisattva is faced with a beggar, he should pro-duce a thought thus: he who gives, he to whom he gives, what he gives,of all these dharmas the own-being cannot be apprehended. And why?Because these dharmas are empty through their absolute emptiness.And emptiness does not give anything or takes anything away. It is thusthat the Bodhisattva should train in perfect wisdom, i.e. in the inwardemptiness, etc. to: in the emptiness of own-marks. When he has stood inthis emptiness, then, wherever he gives gifts, the perfection of giving willGonstantly and always be fulfilled in him. And when he has fulfilled thisperfection of giving he will, when his inner and outer belongings are cutor broken off, produce the thought, 'there is nothing that cuts or breaks(me)'.VIII5.

And these Bodhisattvas learn the Dharma which thoseBuddhas and Lords teach, bear it in mind and never allow it to be forgottenagain before they win the supreme enlightenment.—Moreover, Subhuti,surveying the world with my Buddha-eye, I have seen in all directions,in world systems countless like the sands of the Ganges, Bodhisattvaswho, for the sake of animal beings, perform the surrender of themselves.Again and again all the limbs of these Bodhisattvas are torn to piecesand scattered in the ten directions, and then the animals eat their flesh.They (thus) acquire a feeling of friendliness for these Bodhisattvaa, andthrough their acquisition of this friendliness they emerge from thatanimal world and are reborn among gods and men. On being rebornthere they please the Buddhas and Lords, and serve upon them. Theyhear the Dharma from these Buddhas and Lords, and as a result theyprogress to Thusness. Gradually they are nirvanized in the realm ofNirvana which leaves nothing behind and that through the three vehicles,i.e. the Disciple-vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, or the great vehicle.It is thus that Bodhisattvas achieve much good when they raise theirthought to the supreme enlightenment and progress to Thusness, etc.to: until they win final Nirvana in the realm of Nirvana which leavesnothing behind.VIII 5,1c.

It is thus that the Bodhisattvas,established in the great compassion, demonstrate Dharma to beings.Wonderful indeed is this astonishing dharma of the Bodhisattvas!VIII 5.1e.

It is thus that the Bodhisattva,who courses in perfect wisdom, gives material gifts to all beings andestablishes them in a state of the highest security. This is the Bodhi-sattva's wonderful and astonishing Dharma.(Ib) And how does the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdomhelp beings with the gift of Dharma? There are two kinds of the gift ofDharma.—(Iba) the worldly and (Ibb) the supramundane.(Iba) What then is the gift of the worldly Dharma? It is the teachingof (all) worldly dharmas, their demonstration and revelation, i.e. ofthe ... ? ... of the (9 kinds of) repulsiveness, the four trances, the fourstations of Brahma, the four formless attainments, and of whateverother worldly dharma there may be that are shared by the foolish commonpeople. And when the Bodhisattva has given this gift of worldly dharmas,he then by various methods turns them away from their cultivation andthrough his skill in means establishes them in holy dharmas and in theirfruit. And which are the holy dharmas and which is their fruit? Theholy dharmas are described as the 37 dharmas which act as wings toenlightenment and the three doors to deliverance. The fruit of the holydharmas is the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to : Arhatship. Furthermorethis is the holy dharma of a Bodhisattva that he has a cognition of thefruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: Arhatship, of the enlightenment of aPratyekabuddha, etc. to : of the 37 dharmas which act as wings f o enligh-tenment, etc. to: of the ten powers of a Tathagata, etc. to : of the greatfriendliness, the great compassion, the great sympathetic joy and thegreat impartiality. And if there are (in addition to these) any other worldlyand supramundane dharmas—with or without outflows, conditioned orunconditioned—their cognition up to the knowledge of all modes,these are called the holy dharmas of a Bodhisattva. And what againis for a Bodhisattva the fruit of the holy dharmas? (All the fruits) up tothe forsaking of all defilements and their residues.Subhuti: Does, then, the Bodhisattva reach the knowledge of allmodes?(The Lord: Yes, he does.)Subhuti: In that case, what is the difference between him and a Tatha-gata?The Lord: There is a difference between them.Subhuti: What, then, is it?"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"580  AA VIII5, 1-2  P 528-529The Lord: The Bodhisattva reaches the knowledge of all modes,but the Tathagata is called one who has attained to (its?) cognition.And why?

So much about a Bodhi-sattva's gift of worldly dharma which becomes a basis for his gift ofsupramundane dharmas. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, when he hasenjoined upon beings the gift of the worldly dharmas, goes on, throughhis skill in means, until he establishes them in the knowledge of all modes.VIII 5,2.

With regard to the bodyhe dwells as one who reviews its origination, its disappearance, andboth its origination and disappearance.

THE COGNITION OF DEFILEMENT AND PURIFICATION.(cf. E) Moreover, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, admonishes the Bodhisattvas as follows: 'Sons of good family,may you become skilled in the consummation of the letters! May youbecome skilled in one letter, in two letters, etc. to: in forty-two letters!May you through these forty-two letters come to a state which has movedaway from everything! May you meditate on the 42 letters as containedin one letter, and may you meditate on one single letter as contained in42 letters!' And that Bodhisattva becomes skilled in the 42 letters, and inmeditating on the 42 letters as (contained) in one letter, and in meditatingon one letter as containing the 42 letters. When he has developed the skillin the consummation of the letters, he becomes one who is skilled in theconsummation of the letters. Just as the Tathagata, skilled in dharma(s),skilled in letters demonstrates Dharma, and demonstrates with lettersa Dharma which is without them. And yet that Dharma is not quite freefrom the mode(?) of letters!Subhuti: If absolutely no being can be apprehended, no dharmas andno own-being of these dharmas, on account of absolute (emptiness andthe) emptiness without beginning and end, how does the Bodhisattva whocourses in the six perfections, etc. to: in the eighty accessory marks,demonstrate Dharma to beings after he has stood in the six superknow-ledges born of karma result? For therein he apprehends no being norconcept of a being. From the nonapprehension of a being there is thenonapprehension of form, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas.And in the nonapprehension of a being one cannot conceive of the conceptof a being. How can that Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom((f. 282b)), demonstrate Dharma to beings? May that Bodhisattva notinstigate beings to nonexistent dharmas, may he not enjoin pervertedviews upon them! And why? Because the Bodhisattva, who courses inperfect wisdom, does not even, to begin with, apprehend an enlighten-ment-being, how much less the dharmas which act as wings to enlighten-ment!The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is, as you say. From the nonappre-hension of beings should be known the inward emptiness, etc. to: theemptiness of the nonexistence of own-being (?), the emptiness of theskandhas, etc. to: the emptiness of enlightenment and of the Buddha-field. But when the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, has"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"588  AA VIII5,3  P 537-538seen all these dharmas to be empty, he demonstrates Dharma in such away that he himself (?) does not enter into (?), (these?) emptinesses.When he has seen things in such a way, and has cognized all dharmas aswithout covering, he does not upset any dharma, or divide any one off.But he demonstrates (the Dharma) as it really is. It is just as when themagical creation of a Tathagata, after he has conjured up countless othermagical creations, enjoins the perfection of giving on some, etc. to:enjoins enlightenment on others. What do you think, Subhuti, has thenthat magical creation effected the distinction (or separation) of anydharma whatsoever?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: By this method you should know, Subhuti, that it is thusthat the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom demonstratesDharma to beings, establishes them in true reality and frees them fromthe perverted views, by way of the fact that they are neither bound norfreed. And why? ((f. 283a)) Because form, etc. is neither bound norfreed. And the fact that form, etc. is neither bound nor freed, that isnot form, etc. And why? Because form is absolutely pure; and so for allconditioned and unconditioned dharmas. It is thus surely that the Bodhi-sattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, demonstrates Dharma to beings,but without apprehending a being. It is in the nonapprehension of alldharmas that the Bodhisattva has stood, but without taking his stand onthat. He has stood in the emptiness of form, etc. without taking his standon that. For dharmas, whether conditioned or unconditioned, do notstand anywhere. And why? Because one cannot apprehend of them anown-being in which they could be established. For the nonexistent doesnot stand in the nonexistent, own-being does not stand in own-being,other-being does not stand in other-being. And why? Because they allcannot be apprehended, and an (object of) nonapprehension cannotstand anywhere. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, systematically meditates on these dharmas by way of all theseemptinesses and it is thus that he becomes free from guilt with regard tothe Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, Disciples and all holymen. And why? Because the Buddhas, etc. to : all holy men have under-stood just this Dharmahood and, when they have done so, they demon-strate Dharma to all beings and they do not stray away from theDharmahood of all dharmas. And why? Because Dharmahood does notstray away, nor Suchness, nor the Reality limit. And why? Because theyhave no own-being which could stray away.Subhuti: If that is so, is then form one thing, and the realm of Dharmaanother, Suchness another, and the Reality limit another? And so forall dharmas.The Lord: No, Subhuti. Form, etc. is not one thing, and the realm of"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"P 538-539  AA VIII5,3   589Dharma another, Suchness another and the Reality limit another.Subhuti: If that is so, how, then, O Lord, does one make definitedistinctions, such as: black dharmas lead to a black karma result, i.e. to thehells, the animal world, and the world of Yama; white dharmas lead to awhite karma result, i.e. to (rebirth among) gods and men; black and whitedharmas lead to a black and white karma result, i.e. the experience ofboth happiness and unhappiness; dharmas which are neither black norwhite lead to a karma result which is neither black nor white, i.e. thefruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: the supreme enlightenment.The Lord: When conventional truth has been made into the standard,the definite determination of the fruits can be described, but not by wayof ultimate truth. And why? Because that Dharma is undiscriminatedand incommunicable, since name and form are nonproduction, non-stopping, nondefilement, nonpurification—this is the absolute empti-ness,20 the emptiness without beginning and end.Subhuti: If the determination of the fruit takes places on account ofconventional truth and not in ultimate reality, then all the foolish commonpeople must already have the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to : ((f. 283b))the supreme enlightenment?The Lord: Do, then, the common people wisely know the conventionaland the ultimate truth? If they do, they will also be able to determinethe various fruits, i.e. the fruit of a Streamwinner etc. to: the supremeenlightenment. But the foolish common people do not have the path,nor its development nor a distinctive determination of (its stages)—so how can they have a distinctive determination of its fruits! It is theholy persons who have the path and its development, and it is thereforethey who have a distinctive determination of its fruits.Subhuti: Is there, then, an attainment of the fruit as a result of thedevelopment of the path and can a fruit be attained?The Lord: No, Subhuti, there is no attainment of the fruit as a resultof the development of the path, and no fruit can be attained. In factthere can be no attainment of the fruit without one's having developedthe path, and at the same time no fruit can be attained through the path.It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, distincti-vely defines the fruit of beings, but without having cut off the share of21either the conditioned or the unconditioned element.Subhuti: If that is so, then the Lord has never said that: this is, thefruit of a Streamwinner, i.e. the forsaking of the threefold fetter;this the fruit of a Once-returner, i.e. the attenuation of greed for sensepleasures and of ill will; this the fruit of a Never-returner, i.e. the forsaking20S0 AdT.

How can we understand the meaningof the Lord's teaching, if the distinctive determination of the fruits doesnot take place through cutting off the share of either conditioned orunconditioned dharmas?The Lord: Is, then, the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. conditioned orunconditioned?Subhuti: It is unconditioned, O Lord, not conditioned, O Well-Gone!The Lord: Is there, then, such a thing as the cutting off of the sharewith regard to an unconditioned dharma?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, demonstrates Dharma to beings without cutting off the share,on account of the inward emptiness, etc. to : the emptiness of own-marks.He himself does not settle down in any dharma, and others also he doesnot settle down anywhere, in the perfection of giving, etc. to: in theknowledge of all modes.

He does not stand anywhere, not indharmas with or without outflows, worldly or supramundane, conditionedor unconditioned.

Butbecause beings on their own do not cognize all beings as6 magicalcreations, therefore the Bodhisattva courses for countless aeons in thesix perfections, matures beings, and purifies the Buddha-field.Subhuti: If all dharmas are like a dream, etc. to: like a magical creation,whereon are beings supported, and wherefrom does the Bodhisattva,when he courses in perfect wisdom, set them free?7The Lord: Beings are supported on words and signs, based on imagin-ing that which is not. It is from these words and signs that the Bodhisattva,when he courses in perfect wisdom, sets them free.Subhuti: What are words and what are signs?The Lord: An adventitious designation is this, something added on,i.e. 'words'8 or 'signs'. They are artificial designations whether theyrefer to the skandhas, or to 'women' or 'men', 'sons', 'daughters', 'peoplein the hells', 'animals', 'beings in the world of Yama', 'gods' or 'men','conditioned dharmas' or 'unconditioned dharmas', 'the fruit of aStream winner', etc. to: ((f. 284b)) 'full enlightenment'. In fact, mereconceptual dharmas are all these words, because they are just words.Mere words are all these conditioned things to which the foolish commonpeople have become attached. But the Bodhisattva, who courses inperfect wisdom and is endowed with skill in means, dissuades (thosebeings and says to them:) 'from false imagination has all this verbosityarisen. Do not get attached to a false imagination, to a nonexistent entitywhich is empty in its own-being.'9 Since all dharmas are empty—well-informed people do not settle down in them'. It is thus that the Bodhi-sattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, demonstrates Dharma to beingswith skill in means. And what is a sign? Twofold are the signs to which5dreams or, AdT.6as note #5.\"'uccālayati, lit. 'divert from'.8Lit.

Thesign of form and the sign of the formless. And what is the sign of form?Whatever form there is—whether gross or fine, whether inferior or exalted—that one seizes on these momentary dharmas as the result of a falseimagination, that is called the sign of form. And what is the sign of theformless? Whatever defilement may be generated in him who hasimagined something about formless dharmas after seizing on their sign,that is called the sign of the formless. Therefore the Bodhisattva, whocourses in perfect wisdom, by his skill in means turns people away fromthat sign, makes them enter into the signless realm and establishes themtherein—and that in such a way that they do not fall into a duality,(distinguishing) the sign here from the signless there. It is thus that theBodhisattva, when he courses in perfect wisdom, by his skill in meansturns beings away from the sign and establishes them in the signlessrealm.Subhuti: If all dharmas are no more than this, i.e. no more thanwords and signs, mere concepts, arisen from imaginations—how, then,does the Bodhisattva, when he courses in perfect wisdom, himself reachdistinction in wholesome dharmas, and how does he establish others inthe distinctive achievement of those wholesome dharmas by which theyfulfil one stage after the other, and how does he enjoin the triple vehicleupon beings?The Lord: If the sign were an entity and not a nonentity, then thisBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, could not reach distinctionin wholesome dharmas, nor could he enjoin this distinction on others.But since the sign is a nonentity, and not an entity, the Bodhisattva,when he courses in perfect wisdom, fulfils all spiritual practices by wayof the signless. Having fulfilled these wholesome dharmas, ((f. 285a))he enjoins them also on others, but by way of the signless. If there existedin dharmas a sign of a dharma even as small as the fine point of the tipof a hair, then this Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, couldnot fully awake to a dharma which is signless, unrememberable, andnot a proper object of attention, and he could not establish beings inThusness and in dharmas without outflows. For all dharmas withoutoutflows are signless, unrememberable, and not a proper object ofattention. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,works the weal of all beings through dharmas without outflows.Subhuti: If all dharmas are signless, unrememberable, not a properobject of attention, how, then, can one enumerate as follows: theseare dharmas with outflows, these dharmas without outflows, these arecommon dharmas, these uncommon dharmas, these are Discipledharmas,these Pratyekabuddhadharmas, these Bodhisattvadharmas and theseBuddhadharmas?"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"594   AA VIII5,3  P 543-544The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, is the signless one thing andare the Discipledharmas, etc. to: the Buddhadharmas another?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Is, then, the signless the same as the fruit Streamwinner,etc. to: the dharmas of a Buddha?Subhuti: So it is, O Lord, so it is, O Well-Gone.The Lord: By this method also should one know that all dharmas are(the) signless. When the Bodhisattva trains in all dharmas as signless,then he grows in wholesome dharmas, i.e. the six perfections, etc. to:all Buddhadharmas. And why? Because the Bodhisattva should not trainin any other way, i.e. other than in dharmas which are emptiness, signless,and wishless. And why? Because in these three doors to emancipationall wholesome dharmas are contained. And here the emptiness-door toemancipation means that which is empty of own-marks; the signlessdoor to emancipation means the departure of signs; the wishless door toemancipation means that which has not been brought about.When he trains in these three doors to emancipation the Bodhisattvatrains in the five skandhas, the twelve sense fields, the eighteen elements,the four holy truths, conditioned coproduction with its twelve links, theemptinesses, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas.Subhuti: And how does the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfect wjsdom,train himself with regard to the five grasping skandhas?The Lord'.W Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,wisely knows form, and how form is produced and stopped, and alsowhat is the Suchness of form. How does he wisely know form? Since it isaltogether full of cracks and holes, he wisely knows form to be as un-substantial as a mass of foam. And how ((f. 285b)) does he wisely knowthe production of form? Since it is said that 'form does not come fromanywhere nor does it go to anywhere', he wisely knows the production ofform from the fact that 'form has not come from anywhere nor gone toanywhere'. It is thus that the Bodhisattva wisely knows the productionand passing away of form. And how does he wisely know the Suchness ofform? Suchness is not produced,or stopped, does not come or go, isnot defiled or purified, does not grow or diminish—thus he wisely knowsSuchness. Suchness is never false to itself, that is why it is called Suchness.It is because it does not deviate from itself that it is called Suchness.It is thus that he wisely knows the Suchness of form. And how does hewisely know feeling, its production and passing away, and its Suchness?As (floating) water bubbles (swiftly) rise and (swiftly burst and) vanish,so he wisely knows feeling to be. He wisely knows that feeling does notcome from anywhere and does not go to anywhere. He wisely knowsSuchness as nonfalseness.10The following passage has been translated by Arthur Waley from Hsūan-tsang's Mahā-prajñāpāramitā in my Buddhist Texts through the Ages. 1954, pp. 154-158."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"p 544-545  AA VIII5,3   595And the same for perception, with the difference that he wisely knowsit as a mirage in which absolutely no water can be apprehended. And asto the impulses he wisely knows that they are like the plantain tree inthat, when you strip off one leaf-sheath after another, you cannot appre-hend any core (within). And as to consciousness he wisely knows it asa fourfold army conjured up by a magician.And how does he wisely know the elements? The eye-element is emptyof the own-being of the eye-element. And so for the other seventeenelements. And how does he wisely know the sense fields? Inward dharmasare empty of inward dharmas, and outward dharmas are empty of out-ward dharmas. And how does he wisely know the holy truths? He wiselyknows ill, knows it as a truth, knows it as the truth of the holy men. Hewisely knows the truth of the holy men to be released from duality,because it has been said that 'nondual is the truth of the holy ones'. Andso for the other three truths. And how does he wisely know the Suchnessof ill, and the other truths? He wisely knows the Suchness of ill as justSuchness. And so for the other three truths.And how does he wisely know conditioned coproduction?11 He wiselyknows it as neither production nor stopping, neither cut off nor eternal,neither single nor manifold, neither coming nor going away, as the appea-sement of all futile discoursings, and as bliss.Subhuti: If the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, wiselyknows the mutually separated dharmas in this manner, would not therebythe realm of Dharma be upset?The Lord: The realm of Dharma could be upset if outside it therewere any other dharma. But outside the realm of Dharma no otherdharma can be apprehended. If one could be apprehended, then therewould indeed be an upsetting of the realm of Dharma. And why? NoTathagata, Bodhisattva, Pratyekabuddha or Tathagata-disciple ((f.286a)) has ever apprehended any dharma outside the realm of Dharma.Since none has been apprehended, one does not say that 'a dharma isapprehended outside the realm of Dharma'. It is thus that the Bodhisattvawho courses in perfect wisdom should train in the realm of Dharma.Subhuti: When a Bodhisattva trains in the realm of Dharma, whereindoes he become trained?The Lord: He becomes trained in all dharmas. And why? Because alldharmas are the realm of Dharma.Subhuti: For what reason are all dharmas the realm of Dharma?The Lord: Whether Tathagatas do, or do not, appear—this dharmicelement is established in dharmas, because there is no discriminationabout it. In other words, both the conditioned and the unconditionednThis is very much like Nāgārjuna's famous verse, Madhyamikakārikā I 1-2, whichis there said to be deśayāmāsa sarpbuddhas.

It is thus that the Bodhisattva, when hetrains in perfect wisdom, is trained in the realm of Dharma12 and in alldharmas as well.12Subhuti: If all dharmas are the realm of Dharma, how, then, shouldthe Bodhisattva train in the perfections, etc. to: in ready speech? Howshould he train in the path to enlightenment wherein all dharmas shouldbe cognized in all their modes? Since in the realm of Dharma these falsediscriminations do not exist, may the Bodhisattva avoid coursing in theperverted views, and may he not delay himself by something which is infact no impediment! And why? Because these false discriminations arenot in the realm of Dharma. For the realm of Dharma is not the skandhas,nor is it other than them, but the skandhas are just the realm of Dharma,and the realm of Dharma is just the skandhas. And so for all dharmas.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is, as you say: the skandhas ((f. 286b))are just the realm of Dharma and the realm of Dharma is just the skandhas.But if the Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom would see anydharma outside the realm of Dharma, then he would not be one whohas set out for the supreme enlightenment. But since all dharmas arethe realm of Dharma, therefore the Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom, after he has (correctly) cognized all dharmas as the realm ofDharma, demonstrates the nameless all-dharmas by way of name andconventional expression, as follows: 'this is form' etc. to: 'this isenlightenment'.VIII 5,4. THE TRUE CHARACTER OF (THE WORK FOR) THE WEAL OF BEINGS.It is as if some clever magician or magician's apprentice were, with thehelp of some suitable material preparations13, to exhibit manifold kindsof shapes, i.e. figures of elephants, horses or bulls, of men, women, boysand girls, of delightful parks, mansions and pleasure groves, rivers andlotus ponds. In addition he would exhibit clothes, carpets and bedding,precious flowers and garlands, as well as food and drink, and he woulddelight people with songs and music. Whether he gives gifts, guardsmorality, perfects himself in patience, exerts vigour, plays with the con-centrations or develops wisdom, he delights people in these ways. Heexhibits the three kinds of good families, the various kinds of gods, andalso14 Streamwinners etc. to: Pratyekabuddhas. And he also exhibitsthose Bodhisattvas who, beginning with the first thought of enlighten-ment, course in the six perfections on the ten stages, enter on a Bodhi-sattva's special way of salvation, consummate the superknowledges andplay with them, mature beings, purify the Buddha-field, play with thei2,i2So Tib.!3see Jaeschke p. 468 s. v. rdzas.14 + (immaterial?"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"P 547-548  AA VIII5,4-7  597trances, deliverances, concentrations, and meditational achievements,or give up all their limbs, or go on the difficult pilgrimage, or achieve thepowers of a Tathagata, the grounds of self-confidence, the analyticalknowledges, the great friendliness or the great compassion. Or he mayalso exhibit the figure of a Buddha, complete in body and limbs. Inreaction to this, essentially foolish beings would think this to mean:4Ah, how well-trained that man is, what a beautiful display he has made!How he delights all these people, how he exhibits so many kinds ofshapes, even including the shape of a Buddha!' And if there are amongthem any men who are well-informed, judicious, clever, and endowedwith the ability to make suchlike examinations, they will think to them-selves : 'This is a wonderful and astonishing Dharma! And yet no dharmacan therein be apprehended. For this man delights this crowd of peoplewith nonexistent dharmas'. And they do not apprehend those perceptionsof beings, on the ground that those beings do indeed perceive what isactually real in what is not actually real. It is thus that the Bodhisattvadoes not see any dharma as outside the Dharma-element. Coursing inperfect wisdom through skill in means, he yet does not apprehend a beingand has no concept of a being.VIII 5,5. THE SIX PERFECTIONS.He himself gives gifts and he invites others also to giving, he speaksin praise of giving, and he also speaks in praise of those other beings whogive gifts, one acquiescent; etc. to : ((f. 287a)) he himself develops wisdom,etc.VIII 5,6. THE BUDDHA PATH.He himself proceeds having taken the ten wholesome paths of actionupon himself, and also others he establishes in the ten wholesome pathsof action, and he speaks in praise of the ten wholesome paths of actionand also of those other beings who proceed having taken the ten whole-some paths of action upon themselves, one acquiescent. And so for hisobservance of the sabbath maintaining the first eight precepts, for hisundertaking of the five precepts, his entrance into the trances, etc. to:his development of the eighty accessory marks (of a superman).VIII 5,7. THE EMPTINESS OF ESSENTIAL NATURE.If there were no Dharma-element which is the same in the beginning,end, and middle, the Bodhisattva could not, with his skill in means,indicate the Dharma-element to beings and mature them. But becausethere is such a Dharma-element, the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfectwisdom, indicates through his skill in means the Dharma-element tobeings, courses in the course of a Bodhisattva for the sake of beings andmatures beings."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 75THE EXPOSITION OF IMPERTURBABILITYSubhuti: If absolutely no being is apprehended, nor the concept of abeing, for the sake of whom does the Bodhisattva develop perfect wisdom?The Lord: Having made the Reality limit into a standard, a Bodhi-sattva courses in perfect wisdom. If the Reality limit were one thing,and the beings limit another, a Bodhisattva would not course in perfectwisdom. But since the Reality limit is not one thing, and the beings limitanother, therefore the Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom for thesake of beings. Coursing in perfect wisdom, the Bodhisattva, withoutupsetting the Reality limit, establishes beings in the Reality limit.Subhuti: If the Reality limit is the beings limit, how, then, can oneestablish the Reality limit in the Reality limit? ((f. 287b)) If the Realitylimit were (actually) established in the Reality limit, then own-beingwould be (actually) established in own-being. But own-being is notestablished in own-being. How then does the Bodhisattva, coursing inperfect wisdom, establish beings in the Reality limit?The Lord: The Reality limit is not established in the Reality limit, norown-being in own-being. Nevertheless the Bodhisattva through his skillin means establishes (the) beings (limit) in the Reality limit without up-setting the Reality limit. And yet, the Reality limit is not one thing andthe beings limit another. In fact they are not two nor divided.Subhuti: What is the skill in means of the Bodhisattva, endowed withwhich he establishes, coursing in perfect wisdom, beings in the Realitylimit, but without upsetting the Reality limit?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, fromthe first thought of enlightenment onwards establishes beings in giving.When he has done so he considers that gift at the beginning, end, andmiddle. Just as the gift is empty at the beginning, end, and middle, sois its fruit, and so are the donor and recipient. In this way all these objectsdo not really exist in the Reality limit. Do not imagine that the gift isone thing, its fruit another, the donor another, and the recipient another!If you do not imagine these things, then your gift will become deathlessand terminate in the fruit of deathlessness. But do not through this gifttake hold of any of the skandhas! And why? Because this gift is empty ofa gift, its fruit is empty of a fruit, and also the donor is empty of a donorand the recipient empty of a recipient. For in emptiness no gift can be"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"P 550  AA VIII 5, 7  599apprehended nor its fruit, no donor, and no recipient. And why? Becauseabsolutely these dharmas are empty in their own-being.—Moreover theBodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, establishes beings through hisskill in means in morality. Come here, son of good family, having forsakenthe taking of life, do you become one who abstains from the taking oflife! etc. to: having forsaken wrong views do you become one who abstainsfrom wrong views! There exists in these dharmas no such own-beingas you have imagined. Investigate therefore the dharmic facts whenyou rob living beings of life or (consider that) by which you rob themof their life!1 And this should be done up to wrong views. Endowed withthis skill in means the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,matures beings. He describes the fruit of that gift or morality, (but heknows that) they are both empty in their own-being. Having known thesefruits to be empty, he does not settle down in them and he producesfirst nondistraction and then wisdom. Through that wisdom he cutsof all unwholesome tendencies and all obsessions, and then enters therealm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind—but by way of worldlyconvention and not in ultimate reality. And why? Because in emptinessno dharma can be apprehended which enters final Nirvana or whichis made to enter it. For in fact absolute emptiness is his final Nirvana,((f. 288a))—Moreover the Bodhisattva, on having seen other beings andpersons who have angry and hostile thoughts, instructs and admonishesthem as follows: 'Come here, son of good family, perfect yourself inpatience, develop patience, and become a tolerant person! He who hasill will, that which makes you have ill will, that towards which you haveill will, all these dharmas are empty of an essential nature. Do thereforeinvestigate him who has ill will, him towards whom he has ill will andthat which causes him to have ill will, (and you will find that) all thesedharmas are empty of an essential nature. But the emptiness of essentialnature is never not emptiness. It has not been made by the Tathagatas,nor by the Pratyekabuddhas, or Disciples, or Bodhisattvas, or gods,Nagas etc. to: the gods of the station of neither perception nor non-perception. Do therefore investigate him who feels ill will, him towardwhom you feel ill will, or that whereby you feel ill will, (and you will findthat) all these dharmas are empty of an essential nature. For emptinessdoes not feel ill will toward anyone.' It is thus that a Bodhisattva, coursingin perfect wisdom, through his skill in means enjoins the emptiness ofessential nature upon beings, both as regards the cause and as regards thefruit. As a result he encourages them to gradually win the supremeenlightenment and establishes them in it—and that again by way ofworldly convention and not in ultimate reality. And why? Because in theemptiness of essential nature there is no one who could attain, nothingiThe construction of this sentence is not very clear."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"600  v4^4 VIII 5, 7  P551through which he could attain, and not anything which he could attain.This is the Reality limit, the emptiness of essential nature, wherein theBodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom for the sake of beings, althoughtherein he apprehends no being or the concept of a being. And why?Because all dharmas have nothing to do with 'beings'.—Moreover theBodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom sees beings of inferior vigourand full of sloth, and with his skill in means he encourages them tophysical and mental vigour: 'In the emptiness of essential nature, Oson of good family, there exists no losing of heart on the part of anydharma. That about which he might lose heart, or whereby he wouldlose heart, or he who would lose heart, all these dharmas do not strayaway from the emptiness of essential nature. Do generate mental andphysical vigour, avoid indolence and exert yourself in wholesomedharmas, whether by way of giving, etc. to : by way of all Buddhadharmas!All those dharmas, O son of good family, you should see as unobstructed,because of their emptiness. For in unobstructed dharmas there exists nolosing of heart on the part of any dharma. 'It is thus that the Bodhisattva,coursing in perfect wisdom, by his skill in means encourages beings tothe emptiness of essential nature, settles, and establishes them in it.And he establishes them in such a way that no duality exists therein.And why? Because the emptiness of essential nature is not two nor divided.And a nondual dharma cannot lose heart anywhere. Moreover theBodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom instructs and admonishesbeings in vigour by way of the emptiness of essential nature: 'Come here,son of good family, exert vigour, whether by way of giving, etc. to: byway of the eighteen special Buddhadharmas! But do not attend to thesedharmas from duality or from nonduality! And why? ((f. 288b)) Becausethese dharmas are the emptiness of essential nature, and that should notbe attended to from either duality or nonduality.' It is thus that theBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, and who through his skillin means courses on the pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva, matures beings.Having done so, he gradually2 establishes them in the fruit of a Stream-winner, etc. to: in the supreme enlightenment.—Moreover the Bodhi-sattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, through his skill in means instructsand admonishes beings whose thought is distracted : 'Come here, son ofgood family, and develop transic concentration! May you not becomeone who has notions about either distraction or concentration! And why?Because these dharmas are the emptiness of essential nature. And in theemptiness of essential nature no dharma can be apprehended whichcould either be distracted or become onepointed. When you have stoodin this transic concentration, whatever wholesome root you may bringabout, by body, voice, or mind, whether by your giving of gifts, etc. to :Successively; step by step."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"P 552-553  A A VIII 5, 7  601by your purification of the Buddha-field, all these wholesome dharmaswill become manifest in you with little trouble when you course in theemptiness of essential nature.' It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who coursesin perfect wisdom, works the weal of beings through his skill in meansever after he has had his first thought of enlightenment. He always per-forms good works and constantly seeks for what is wholesome whileworking the weal of beings. He constantly passes on from Buddha-fieldto Buddha-field, and there honours the Buddhas and Lords. And theDharma which he hears from those Buddhas and Lords, that he neverforgets again until he has won the supreme enlightenment, even afterhe has passed beyond this present birth. He is constantly and always inpossession of the dharanis, and his faculties are (always) complete,3whether they be physical, vocal, or mental. And why? Because he hasconstantly and always well developed the knowledge of all modes, andin consequence all the paths become well developed, i.e. the paths of theDisciples, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas. The superknowledges ofthat Bodhisattva will constantly and always be used to benefit others,because they are never lost. Having stood in these superknowledgeswhich result from the maturation of deeds, he works the weal of beings,and does not avoid Samsara with its five places of rebirth. It is thus thatthe Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, having stood in theemptiness of essential nature, works the weal of beings through his skillin means.—When he has well developed that perfection of wisdom, heinstructs and admonishes beings as follows: 'Come here, son of goodfamily, whatever deeds you may do, by body, voice, or mind, all thatyou should consider as empty of essential original nature, and thenthey will lead to a deathless fruit and terminate in the deathless. For inthe emptiness of essential original nature one cannot apprehend anydharma which one could destroy or diminish, ((f. 289a)) And why?Because the emptiness of essential nature cannot be diminished, nor canany dharma be diminished in the emptiness of essential nature. And why?Because the emptiness of essential nature is neither an existent nor anonexistent. How can anything be diminished if all dharmas have non-existence for own-being?' It is thus that the Bodhisattva who courses inperfect wisdom instructs and admonishes beings through his skill inmeans. And when he instructs and admonishes them in such a manner,he never ceases to do good works. Constantly and always he himselfobserves the ten wholesome paths of action, and also others he encouragesto observe them; etc. to: he himself produces the path to the supremeenlightenment, and also others he instructs in that path, admonishesthem (to tread it), exhorts them to it, disciplines them, and establishesthem in it.

Nor could he, on havingwon full enlightenment, demonstrate dharmas as empty of essentialnature. The skandhas are (actually) empty of essential nature. Thereforethe Bodhisattva, when he courses in perfect wisdom, demonstratesDharma to the effect that the five skandhas are empty of essential nature,etc. to: that the forsaking of all defilements together with their residuesis empty of essential nature, ((f. 289b)) If again the inward emptiness8were not empty of essential nature, then the Bodhisattva would notdemonstrate Dharma to the effect that all dharmas are empty of essentialnature. And so for the other kinds of emptiness. Because if he did, theemptiness of essential nature would have been destroyed; but the empti-ness of essential nature cannot be destroyed, nor does it overtower allchange,9 nor again does it depart (at some future time). And why?Because it does not stand in any spot or place; it does not come fromanywhere nor does it go to anywhere. That is the stability of Dharma inwhich one can apprehend no accumulation or removal of any dharma,no diminution or growth, no production or stopping, no defilement orpurification. And that is the essential nature of dharmas in which theBodhisattvas have stood when they set out for the supreme enlightenment.And yet they do not review the setting out of any dharma, nor its not-setting-out. Because no dharma has set out or has stood (anywhere).This is the dharmic stability of dharmas. Therefore the Bodhisattva,who courses in perfect wisdom and who has seen all dharmas as empty ofessential nature, does not turn back on the supreme enlightenment.And why? Because, reviewing no obstruction to any dharma, he reviewsall dharmas as unobstructed. So how can he have doubts about thesupreme enlightenment when in this emptiness of essential nature nobeing can be apprehended, etc. to: so one should consider (all) inwardand outward dharmas, up to the eighty accessory marks.477: Path^satjipratisthate«77:Path.1pratiti$fhet8or: emptiness of the subject, at P 195.9na kūtastho bhavati = 'unmoved' at P 195."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"P 553-554  AA VIII5,8  603VIII 5,8.

And why? Because they would have no objectivebasis (for that).The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. When all dharmas have no objectivebasis,1 ° what is that being whom the Bodhisattva could exhort to (win)the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: the supreme enlightenment? So allthat he actually does is to exhort people who are enveloped in pervertedviews and exhort them to nonperversion and establish them in it. And thatperversion is in any case just a nonperversion, because it has issued from(nothing but) thought-constructions. For nonperversion is free from alldiscriminations. Where there is no perversion there is no self, no being,etc. to: no enlightenment. And where there is no form, etc. to: noenlightenment, that is the emptiness of essential nature, dwelling inwhich the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, frees beings subjectto the perversions from the notion of a being, from notions about thingswith and without form, etc. to : from all dharmas with outflows.

And that emptinessof essential nature is an emptiness of essential nature at the beginning,at the end, and in the middle, and it is never not the emptiness of essentialnature. Therefore the Bodhisattva, who courses in the perfectionswhich are the emptiness of essential nature, courses in the knowledge ofthe modes of the path in order to free from all notions those beings whohave formed the notion of a being. When he courses in the knowledge ofthe modes of the path he courses in all the paths, i.e. that of the Disciples,Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas.

And apart from thisemptiness of essential nature no manifestation in the world of the Buddhasand Lords takes place. It is in their presence that the Bodhisattva shouldcourse in the perfections which are the emptiness of essential nature,in such a way that he does not lose the knowledge of all modes.Subhuti: It is wonderful, O Lord, that the Bodhisattvas should coursein dharmas which are all empty of essential nature, and yet do not upsetthis emptiness of essential nature (by assuming that) form is one thingand the emptiness of essential nature another. And so up to enlightenment.Form is just the emptiness of essential nature, just the emptiness ofessential nature is form. And so up to enlightenment.The Lord: If form, etc. were one thing, and the emptiness of essentialnature another, and if form etc. were not empty of essential nature,then the Bodhisattva could not know the supreme enlightenment,((f. 290b)) But it is because form, etc. to: enlightenment are empty ofessential nature that the Bodhisattva, having known all dharmas aswithout essential nature, knows the supreme enlightenment.

No one who courses in dualitycan have enlightenment, nor does enlightenment cause divisions. Forenlightenment is not two nor divided.

THE COGNITION (OF DHARMAS AS MERELY) CONVENTIONALSYMBOLS.It is therefore on account of what is dharmically a concept due toworldly convention that the Bodhisattva fully knows the supreme en-lightenment. But in ultimate reality there is not anything that is form,etc. to : enlightenment, and there is no one who courses in enlightenment.All these dharmas have been conceived on account of convention, andnot by way of ultimate reality. And in consequence that Bodhisattva who,from the first thought of enlightenment onwards, courses towardsenlightenment does not apprehend those thoughts, as well as no beingsor enlightenment, no Buddha or Bodhisattva. What do you think,Subhuti, at the time when Subhuti had forsaken the view of individuality,had acquired (the five cardinal) virtues, had attained the unimpededconcentration, or the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: of Arhatship,had on that occasion a dream been apprehended, or a thought, or a pathor a fruit?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: Had you, then, Subhuti, attained Arhatship when youannounced that you had won the final saving gnosis?Subhuti: Yes, by way of worldly convention.The Lord'. So it is, Subhuti. Through worldly convention has theBodhisattva been conceived, and so has form, etc. to: the knowledge of allmodes. But the Bodhisattva has not apprehended any dharma, of whichhe could effect an accumulation or removal, a benefit or harm—onaccount of the essential nature of dharma(s). And that dharmic natureof dharmas has not been apprehended, how much less could one appre-hend the first thought of enlightenment, etc. to: the tenth stage, etc.to: the Buddhadharmas.

It is thus that aBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, will through his skill inmeans know the supreme enlightenment. And likewise the Bodhisattvawill find the path to enlightenment if, coursing in perfect wisdom, hecourses in the perfection of morality, but does not apprehend morality,or someone who observes morality, and also does not course in dharmasother than these.

And why? Because there exists no own-being of anydharma whatsoever. When thus all dharmas have no own-being, what is acommon person, what a Streamwinner, etc. to: what a Tathagata?When these persons cannot be apprehended, then wherefrom can thesedharmas become manifest by which one could define that this is a commonperson, etc. to: this is a Tathagata?Śāriputra: When all dharmas are nonentities, how should one inter-pret the canonical text which says that this is a common person, etc. to :this is a Tathagata?The Lord: Is form, etc. an entity or something truly existent in theway in which the foolish common people have settled down in it?Śāriputra: No, O Lord, except by way of perverted views, ((f. 292b)).The Lord: So it is, Śāriputra, so it is. It is by way of perversion thatbeings imagine dharmas which are nonentities to be existents. It isbecause of this that a Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom andwho sees, through this skill in means, all dharmas as nonentities, setsout for the supreme enlightenment.VIII 5,11. THE MATURING OF BEINGS.Śāriputra: What is the skill in means of the Bodhisattva by which,seeing all dharmas as nonentities, he sets out for the supreme enlighten-ment?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,does not review any dharma as an entity by which he could be frustrated,with the result that he would crouch, lose heart, and become indolent.But because all dharmas are nonentities, without a living soul, devoid ofa living soul, with nonexistence for their own-being, empty of essentialnature and empty of own-marks, it is only through utter confusionthat beings have adhered to what they call the 'skandhas', 'elements',or 'sense fields'. Therefore the Bodhisattva, who beholds all dharmasas having nonexistence for their own-being, as empty of essential nature,and as empty of own-marks, courses in perfect wisdom, sustains himselfon a personality, which is like a magical illusion or like space, and de-monstrates Dharma to beings.

And when those beings have becomeestablished in giving, etc. to : in the perfection of wisdom, then he finallypreaches to them a sermon which is holy, leading to going forth and topenetration, and by which they attain the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc.to : the knowledge of all modes.Śāriputra: How, then, does the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfectwisdom, become one who leans on a basis when he enjoins beings whoare not and do not exist in giving, etc. to : in wisdom, and when he finallypreaches a sermon which is holy and leads to going forth, by which theyattain the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to : the knowledge of all modes?The Lord: The Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of wisdomhas, of course, no basis at all. And why? Because he apprehends nobeings whatsoever, except that he speaks of them by way of conventionallanguage and agreed symbols. And thus the Bodhisattva demonstratesDharma to beings after he has stood in the two truths, i.e. the conven-tional and the ultimate truth. For when he has considered both truths,he apprehends no being and has no concept of a being. It is, on the con-trary, through his skill in means that the Bodhisattva, coursing in perfectwisdom, demonstrates Dharma to beings. In consequence, those beingsin this very life do not apprehend a self, how much less that which theywill attain, or that by which they will attain. It is thus that the Bodhi-sattva ((f. 293a)), who courses in perfect wisdom, demonstrates Dharmato beings through skill in means.Śāriputra: A great product, indeed, O Lord, is the Bodhisattva, thegreat being! For he does not apprehend of any dharma whatsoever thesingleness or manifoldness, or even the separateness. And he is armed withsuch an armour that he does not (actually) appear in the world of sensedesire, the world of form, or the formless world, neither in the conditionedor the unconditioned world. He liberates beings from the triple worldand yet he apprehends no beings or concept of a being. Where beingsare not conceived they are neither bound nor freed, and they can undergoneither defilement nor purification, and no differentiation betweenthe places of rebirth can therefore be conceived. In the absence of adifferentiation between the places of rebirth there is also no karma andno defilement—how can there be a karma result by which selves andbeings could (actually) appear in Samsara with its five places of rebirth?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is, as you have said. If a being hadexisted in the past, and later on had not existed, that would be a fault.And it would likewise be a fault if the Bodhisattva or Tathagata hadbeen an existent in the past and later on a nonexistent, and the sameapplies to Samsara with its five places of rebirth. But because, whetherTathagatas are produced or not, established is this Dharmahood of"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"610  AA VIII 5, 11-12  P 560-561dharmas, their Suchness and Nonfalseness, wherein there is no self,being, living soul, person, doer, or agent;—how can there be the skan-dhas! And when those dharmas are not, how can there be that Samsarawith its five places of rebirth from which beings should be liberated?But because these dharmas are empty of own-being, therefore the Bodhi-sattva, having listened to the Buddhas and Lords of the past, firmlysets out for the supreme enlightenment—though there is not thereinany dharma which you could apprehend, or on which, after apprehendingit, you could base your resolve, or in which beings have settled down—except by way of perversion. It is thus that the Bodhisattva is armed withthe great armour which enables him not to turn back on the supremeenlightenment: 'Not should I not fully know the supreme enlightenment!In fact I should fully know it! Thereafter I shall work the weal of beingsand thereby liberate them from the perversions!' It is as if a person whohas been conjured up by a magician were to conjure up a vast number ofliving beings and refresh them with exquisite food and drinks, and wouldthen cry out in triumph, 'Much merit have I begotten, much merit haveI begotten!' What do you think, Sariputra, would in this case anybodyhave been fed or refreshed?Śāriputra: No, O Lord.The Lord: Just so the Bodhisattva, from the first thought of enlighten-ment onwards, coursing in the six perfections, etc. to: the eighteenspecial Buddhadharmas, ((f. 293b)) fulfils the path to enlightenment,purifies the Buddha-field and matures beings, and yet he does not appre-hend any being1 which he would discipline after having apprehended it.VIII 5,12. THE PATH OF A BODHISATTVA.Subhuti: What is the enlightenment-path of a Bodhisattva, coursingin which he should mature beings and purify the Buddha-field?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, from the first thought of enlighten-ment onwards, courses in the six perfections, etc. to: in the eighteenspecial Buddhadharmas, and both matures beings and purifies theBuddha-field.Subhuti: And how does he mature beings when he courses in theperfection of giving?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva gives gifts to beings, and thereuponinstructs and admonishes them as follows: 'Here, son of good family,do not acquisitively grasp at the gift! May you not, seized by acquisitive-ness with regard to the gift, reproduce your personality in such a waythat in due course you will experience many ills! For here, in ultimatereality, there is no gift or its fruit, there is no donor or recipient. Allthese dharmas are empty of essential nature, and a dharma which is*as a dharmic fact."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"P 561-562  AA VIII5, 12   611empty of essential nature cannot seize upon a dharma. For the emptinessof essential nature is ungraspable.' It is thus that a Bodhisattva, coursingin the perfection of giving, gives gifts to beings, but without apprehendinga gift, donor, or recipient. A perfection without a basis is that, i.e. theperfection of giving. When he does not make a basis of thesedharmas, he establishes beings in the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to:he enjoins the supreme enlightenment upon beings. It is thus that theBodhisattva, coursing in perfect wisdom, matures beings. He himselfgives gifts and others also he encourages to give gifts; he speaks in praiseof giving, and of those others also who give gifts he speaks in praise,one acquiescent. In consequence the Bodhisattva, who has given greatgifts in this manner, is reborn in good families, he becomes the king of afort or a universal ruler, or he acquires universal kingship. He then winsover those beings by means of the four means of conversion. Which four?Namely, giving, kind words, helpfulness, and consistency between wordsand deeds. When he has won over beings by his gifts he gradually2 estab-lishes them in morality, etc., in the concentrations on emptiness, thesignless, and the wishless, he enters on the certainty that he will winsalvation by the methods appropriate to the Disciples, etc. to : he makesthem attain Arhatship and the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha, andincites them to win the supreme enlightenment. 'Look here, you people,the supreme enlightenment is easy to know! In it no dharma exists byway of own-being, nor any beings except by way of the perverted views.Therefore cut yourselves off from seizing upon all the perverted views!((f. 294a)) Free yourselves from Samsara, and free others as well! Inthis way you will work a great weal for yourselves, and also enjoin agreat weal upon others!' It is thus that the Bodhisattva should course inthe perfection of giving and as a result he will not, from the first thoughtof enlightenment onwards, ever fall again into a bad rebirth, nor will heever fail to achieve universal kingship. And why? Just as the seed so isthe fruit. When petitioners come again and again to that universal mo-narch, he thinks to himself: 'I have taken hold of universal kingship forno other reason than to benefit beings.' And he says: 'Whatever youmay want, it will be given to you. It is yours and not mine. I have nodesire even for this inward3 body, how much less for anything else!I have laid hold of Samsara for no other reason than to benefit all beings.'Whereas he has no desire for Samsara he feels compassion and fulfils thegreat compassion, which enables him to work the weal of beings. And hedoes not apprehend those beings as fully real, but refers to them only asnotions, agreed symbols, and conventional expressions. But this con-ventional expression is like an echo and should be known as incommuni-2successively.3This is Buddhist jargon for 'this, my own body'."},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"612  AA VIII 5, 12  P 562-563cable. It is thus that a Bodhisattva should course in the perfection ofgiving, i.e. in such a way that there is nothing that he has not abandonedto beings—not even his own flesh, how much less those outward servicesby which beings should be freed from Samsara.Subhuti: And what are these services?The Lord: The six perfections, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddha-dharmas are the services which help beings to get free from Samsara.—Moreover the Bodhisattva who has stood in the perfection of givingand who gives gifts should then speak as follows : 'May you guard yourmorality! I will cause you to have an abundance of food, drinks, etc. to :anything else that may be useful to you. For it is through your deficiencyin these things that you do immoral deeds. That is why I will cause youto have an abundance of food, drinks, etc. to : the seven treasures, andin consequence you will, having stood in moral restraint, graduallyput an end to ill through the three vehicles, i.e. the vehicle of the Disciples,the vehicle of the Pratyekabuddhas, and the cognition of the knowledgeof all modes'. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who has stood in the per-fection of giving, wins beings over through the perfection of morality.—Moreover the Bodhisattva when he has stood in the perfection of giving,speaks as follows to those beings who become enraged or who feel illwill: 'For what reason do you, sons of good family, feel ill will? If thelack of anything makes you feel ill will, then you can get it from me. Iwill bring about for you an abundance of food, drinks, etc. to: anythingthat might be useful to you, so that you may not become angry ((f. 294b))or feel ill will'. In this way the Bodhisattva, who has stood in the perfec-tion of giving, enjoins patience on beings: 'There is nowhere any existentor anything substantial from which your wrath is produced. An unrealfancy is this wrath. No real entity corresponds to it, nor is there a realentity which offends you, makes you feel anger or ill will, or which makesyou belabour others with sticks or swords, or rob one another of life.When you have got angry as a result of an unfounded imagination,you will be hurled into the hells, the animal world, or the world of Yama,or any other place of bad rebirth where you will experience painfulfeelings—intense,.harsh, and bitter. Do not, O you people, for the sakeof dharmas which are nonentities acquire a karma which precludes theacquisition of a human rebirth, how much more so that of Buddhahood.In fact, hard to get, Sir, is Buddhahood, hard to get is the acquisitionof a human birth. May you not be estranged from these timely rebirths,may you not be filled with doubts!' In consequence the Bodhisattvaperfects himself in patience, and enjoins patience also on others; hespeaks in praise of patience, and also of those others who develop patience,one acquiescent. Thereupon, having enjoined patience on those beings,having established them in patience, he leads them step by step to final"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"P 563-565  AA VIII5, 12   613Nirvana through the three vehicles. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, whenhe has stood in the perfection of giving, wins beings over to the perfectionof patience.—And how does the Bodhisattva, coursing in the perfectionof giving, enjoin the perfection of vigour on beings? Here the Bodhi-sattva, who has known of beings who are indolent, will say to them:'For what reason have you become so indolent?' And they will reply,'because of the deficiency of the necessary conditions'. But the Bodhi-sattva, who courses in the perfection of giving, will say to them : 'I willsurely provide you with all the necessary conditions, be they giving, ormorality, or patience, or whatever else is necessary for you to exertvigour'. In consequence through the services of the Bodhisattva thosebeings exert vigour, physical or mental, and through that physical andmental vigour they fulfil all wholesome dharmas; through them againthey develop the holy dharmas without outflows, and as a result they willattain the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to : they will fully know the supremeenlightenment. It is thus that the Bodhisattva, who has stood in the per-fection of giving, wins beings over to the perfection of vigour.—Andhow does the Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of giving enjointhe perfection of meditation on beings? Here the Bodhisattva, who hasseen beings who are distracted in their thoughts, admonishes them asfollows: 'How is it, O beings, that you do not enter on the trances?'And they reply to him, 'because of the deficiency in the necessary condi-tions'. But the Bodhisattva then says to them: 'I, my dear people, willprovide you with the necessary conditions, which will enable you tohave no discursive thoughts (concerning) either inward or outward'.Thereupon the Bodhisattva will provide these beings with the conditionswhich enable them to have no discursive thoughts. And these beingswith their discursive thoughts cut off, will enter on the four trances andthe four Unlimited, ((f. 295a)) Through those trances they will come todevelop the eightfold path^and as a result will gradually reach final Nirvanathrough the three vehicles. And some of them will not lose the path ofenlightenment until they win the supreme enlightenment. It is thus thatthe Bodhisattva, who has stood in the perfection of giving, wins beingsover to the perfection of meditation.—And how does the Bodhisattvawho courses in the perfection of giving win beings over to the perfectionof wisdom? Here the Bodhisattva says to them: 'How is it, O beings,that you do not develop the perfection of wisdom?' And they will reply,'because of the deficiency in the necessary conditions'. Thereupon theBodhisattva who has stood in the perfection of giving admonishes thosebeings as follows : 'Avail yourselves of my services, and when you givegifts, etc. to : enter into trance, then, having fulfilled these modes, investi-gate as follows : is there any dharma which can be apprehended when theperfection of wisdom is being taught, i.e. a self, etc. to: the supreme"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"614  AA VIII 5, 12  P 565enlightenment?' The Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of wisdomthus does not apprehend any dharma; in consequence he does not settledown in one; and in consequence he does not review the production orstopping of any dharma whatsoever, nor its defilement or purification.As a result he does not discriminate as follows: this is someone in thehells, this is an animal, this is someone in the world of Yama, this one isan Asura, this one a god, this one a human being; this one a moral person,this one an immoral one; this one a Streamwinner, etc. to: this one aTathagata, an Arhat, a fully enlighteed Buddha.

It is thus that theBodhisattva wins beings over to the holy dharmas without outflows.—Moreover the Bodhisattva, who courses in the perfection of giving, andwho has seen beings who are helpless, suffering, and without food orshelter, matures them in this way : 'Come here, you sons of good family,take from me food, etc. to: the seven treasures, and let me thus helpbeings! And all that will contribute to your welfare, weal, and happinessfor a long time. But do not think that this benefit is theirs and not ours!For it is just for the sake of beings that I have procured this benefit over along time'. But he should give gifts after he has reflected that 'what ismy very own that is yours'. In this way he enjoins (upon beings) thatgiving, morality, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddhadharmas (Andhe adds:) 'Do not be contented with these, but you must go further andestablish those beings finally in the holy dharmas without outflows,in the fruit of a Streamwinner, etc. to: in the supreme enlightenment.'It is thus that a Bodhisattva, who courses in the perfection of wisdom,should mature beings in such a way that they are (gradually) liberatedby the triple device, until in the end they are set free from Samsara.—Moreover the Bodhisattva, who has stood in the perfection of morality,should mature beings as follows : 'It is through the lack of the necessaryconditions that you are immoral, but I will bestow those necessary condi-tions upon you, i.e. food, etc. to: anything that may be useful to you'.Having stood in the perfection of morality, he helps beings in this mannerwith the result that they conform to the ten wholesome ways of action.He has established them in moral restraint so that their morality becomesunimpaired, etc. to: untarnished.—And this should be worked out forall the six perfections."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 77THE COGNITION OF THE PERFECT PURITYOF THE BUDDHA-FIELDSubhuti: What is the Bodhisattva's path, having stood wherein heshould put on this kind of armour?The Lord: The six perfections, etc. to: the eighteen special Buddha-dharmas. Moreover all dharmas are the Bodhisattva's path. What do youthink, Subhuti, is there any dharma in which the Bodhisattva should notbe trained, and yet win full enlightenment? There is no dharma in whichhe should not be trained, because untrained (in each and every dharma)a Bodhisattva is not capable of attaining the knowledge of all modes.Subhuti: If all dharmas are empty, how can a Bodhisattva train inthem? Does he not form discursive ideas about something which iswithout them if he thinks that: 'there are so many of these and not ofthose; these dharmas are worldly or supramundane, with or withoutoutflows, conditioned or unconditioned, dharmas of the common people,etc. to: dharmas of Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, or Buddhas'?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. All dharmas are empty. If againall dharmas were not empty, then, the Bodhisattva could not fully knowthe supreme enlightenment. But because all dharmas are empty, there-fore the Bodhisattva does fully know the supreme enlightenment. More-over, Subhuti, when you say, 'if all dharmas are empty, how does aBodhisattva effect a differentiation of dharmas, to the effect that: thereare so many of these and not of those; etc. to : there are the dharmas of thecommon people, etc. to: the dharmas of Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, orBuddhas'. It is just possible that those beings might cognize that alldharmas are empty. If they did so, ((f. 269a)) that Bodhisattva would notreach the knowledge of all modes with regard to all dharmas. But becausethey do not cognize that 'all dharmas are empty', therefore the Bodhi-sattva, having fully known the supreme enlightenment, having notedthe distinctive differentiation of all dharmas, demonstrates Dharma tobeings.VIII 5,13.

And why? Because through their own-beingall dharmas are empty, and emptiness cannot settle down in emptiness.The very emptiness, to begin with, cannot be apprehended, how muchless he who can settle down in emptiness! It is thus that the Bodhisattvadwells without having settled down in any dharma. Having stood inthis training, he surveys all the practices in which beings course, askshimself wherein they do course and thinks to himself that they course inseizing on that which is not. And the Bodhisattva further reflects that'well freed, surely, are those beings from seizing on that which is not!'Thereupon through skill in means, having stood in the perfection ofwisdom, he admonishes them as follows: 'May you beings give gifts,and then you will have an abundance of all that you need. But do notput your minds to that which you need, because within it there is nocore!' And so he admonishes them in morality: 'May you beings guardmorality, but do not put your minds to that morality, for within it thereis no core', and so for the other virtues, up to the dharmas of a Buddha.When he thus instructs and admonishes, he courses in the path to enligh-tenment, but does not settle down anywhere. And why? Because alldharmas are unfit to settle down in. For they have no own-being in whichone could settle down, on account of the fact that their own-being con-sists of emptiness. In consequence the Bodhisattva who courses in thepath to enlightenment does not abide anywhere. By way of abidingnowhere he courses in the six perfections, but does not abide in them.He enters on the trances, but does not abide in them. And why? Becausethe trance is empty of itself, and also he who enters on it is empty, andalso the modes through which he enters are empty, ((f. 296b)) And so on,up to the enlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha.Subhuti: For what reason does he not abide (therein?)The Lord: For two reasons. Which two? The fruits in which he couldabide have no own-being, nor has that by which he could abide, or hewho could abide. Nor is he easily contented, (but he thinks to himself:)'not should I not attain the fruit of a Streamwinner, but I should notstand still at that point'; etc. to : 'I should not rest until I have won thesupreme enlightenment.

Because I have not evenfrom the first stage onwards produced any thought which lies outsidethe supreme enlightenment; and so up to the tenth stage; etc. to : whenhe has entered on a Bodhisattva's special mode of salvation, he has neverproduced any thought which lies outside the supreme enlightenment.'"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"P 566-567  A A VIII 5, 13-14  617As with an undistracted mind the Bodhisattva heroically advances byway of body, voice, and mind, he never does so without reference tothis thought of enlightenment.

All dharmas are unproduced.For is it not so that all dharmas are unproduced for those who do noteffect any karma formations?Subhuti: Is it not so, O Lord, that whether Tathagatas are produced,or whether they are not produced, just established is this fixed dharmicorder of dharmas?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is.

THE PURITY OF THE BUDDHA-FIELD.Subhuti: How does a Bodhisattva purify the Buddha-field?The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, from the first thought of enlighten-ment onward, cleanses away all wickedness of body, speech, and mind,on the part of himself and of others. Through their being perfectly purehe purifies the Buddha-field.Subhuti: What is a Bodhisattva's wickedness of body, speech, andmind?The Lord: Unwholesome bodily action, i.e. taking life, taking whatis not given and sexual misconduct, that is his'wickedness of body.Unwholesome verbal action, i.e. false speech, slander, harsh speech,and frivolous talk, that is his wickedness of speech. Unwholesome mentalaction, i.e. covetousness, ill will, and wrong views, that is his wickednessof mind. Moreover any thought of meanness is for a Bodhisattva wicked-ness of mind, and so is any thought of immorality, anger, indolence,distraction, unconcentratedness, or stupidity. Moreover any moralitythat is not perfectly pure, that is wickedness for a Bodhisattva. And soit is to be deprived of the four applications of mindfulness, etc. to: thewishless concentration; the realization of the fruit of a Streamwinnerwhen accompanied by the longing for it, etc. to: the realisation of theenlightenment of a Pratyekabuddha when accompanied by the longingfor it; the notion of the five skandhas, the twelve sense fields and theeighteen elements; ((f. 297b)) the notions of women and men, of thetriple world, of wholesome and unwholesome, etc. to: the notion of theconditioned and of the unconditioned, that also is wickedness of body,speech, and mind. In consequence the Bodhisattva, who courses inperfect wisdom, abandons all those kinds of wickedness, and then hehimself gives gifts and also encourages others to giving; he gives food tothe hungry, etc. to: anything that may be useful, and also others heencourages to give anything that may be useful, and establishes themin giving these things. When he has made the resulting wholesome rootcommon to all beings, he dedicates it to the purification of the Buddha-field. And so with morality, etc. to : wisdom. He himself perfects a greattrichiliocosm which is made of the seven jewels, and then gives it as agift to the Triple Jewel. And he thinks to himself: 'May I through that"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"P569   AA vni 5, 15  619wholesome root have a Buddha-field made of the seven treasures!'Moreover the Bodhisattva plays heavenly musical instruments, in honourof the Buddhas or their shrines. And he thinks to himself that 'as a resultof that wholesome root may I constantly and always have musical instru-ments which make heavenly and charming sounds!' Moreover the Bodhi-sattva fills the great trichiliocosm with heavenly perfumes and givesthem to the Buddhas or their shrines. And he thinks to himself, 'throughthis wholesome root may my Buddha-field emit heavenly scents!' More-over the Bodhisattva gives the most excellent foods to the Tathagatasor their disciples. And he thinks to himself, 'as a result of this wholesomeroot may there accrue the most excellent foods for the community ofmy disciples in my Buddha-field when I have known the supremeenlightenment!' Moreover the Bodhisattva gives heavenly ointments tothe Tathagatas or to their shrines. And he thinks to himself, 'as a resultof this wholesome root may there accrue in my Buddha-field, when I haveknown the supreme enlightenment, heavenly touchables to all beings!'Moreover the Bodhisattva thinks to himself, 'may I by my good inten-tions alone bestow upon the Buddhas and Lords, their disciples and allbeings agreeable sense pleasures of the five kinds!' And when he has hadthis idea he thinks to himself, 'as a result of this wholesome root, whenI have known the supreme enlightenment in that Buddha-field, thefivefold agreeable sense pleasures will be manifested to the whole commu-nity of the disciples and to all beings just as a result of their wishing forthem'. Moreover the Bodhisattva gives the fivefold sense pleasures asa gift to the Buddhas and their disciples, together with all beings. More-over the Bodhisattva who courses in the perfection of wisdom thinks asfollows: 'Now that I have myself entered on the four trances, the fourUnlimited, etc. may I also introduce other beings to them! When Ihave won the supreme enlightenment, may all beings not be deprivedof the four trances, etc. to : the thirty-seven dharmas which act as wingsto enlightenment!' It is thus that ((f. 298a)) the Bodhisattva purifies theBuddha-field. He does not know the supreme enlightenment until allthose intentions are fulfilled. He himself becomes endowed with allwholesome roots, and he also causes all beings to be endowed withwholesome roots. His own body becomes handsome, and the bodiesalso of those beings whom he has matured become handsome, beautifulto behold, and graceful—with the help of his merit. It is thus that aBodhisattva purifies the Buddha-field in such a way that there is nolonger even the concept of the three states of woe, of the false views,of greed, hate, and delusion, of women and men, the two vehicles, imper-manence, ill, and not-self, a recipient, I-making, and Mine-making,latent biases and obsessions, the perverted views or the differentiationbetween the various fruits. But there is a proclamation of the concen-"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"620  AAVIU5,\\5  P 570trations on emptiness, the signless, and the wishless. And when the windstirs the branches of the trees, those beings hear an admonition torenounce both their inward and outward2 properties. From all inwardand outward dharmas there issues the message that 'this is emptiness,signless, and wishless', that it is nonproduction and nonstopping. Justas the own-being of these dharmas is, so the words express it, sayingthat all dharmas are empty of all dharmas. Whether Tathagatas areproduced or not, all dharmas are empty of all dharmas. And what isempty, therein there is no sign and it is also wishless—this is the kind ofdemonstration of Dharma which will emerge. Night and day this kind ofdemonstration of Dharma will emerge in that Buddha-field when hehas fully known the supreme enlightenment—to those who stand, sit,lie down, or walk along. And all the Buddhas and Lords in the worldsystems in the ten directions speak in praise of this Tathagata. And thosewho will hear His name, they will also be definitely destined for the sup-reme enlightenment. And none of the beings to whom the Tathagata,who has won the supreme enlightenment, teaches the Dharma has anyuncertainty as to whether this is the Dharma and that is not the Dharma.And why? In the dharmic nature of all dharmas there is no non-dharma,and all of it is Dharma. But those beings who are possessed by unwhole-some roots, who have not planted wholesome roots under the Buddhasor their disciples, or who have been taken hold of by bad spiritual teachers,they cling to the false view of a self, etc. to : they cling to all false views.They take their stand on the extremes, i.e. on annihilation or eternity.Seized by a wrong conception they form the notion of fully enlightenedBuddhas with regard to those who are not fully enlightened Buddhas,and with regard to the fully enlightened Buddhas they form the notionthat they are not fully enlightened Buddhas. They speak of what is notthe Dharma as if it were the Dharma, and they speak of Dharma as ifit were not the Dharma. They reject the Dharma, and in consequencewhen their body has broken up they will after their death fall into a stateof woe and a bad destiny, and be reborn in the hells. And the Buddhasand Lords, after they have known the supreme enlightenment, willliberate those beings who are included in Samsara from both their evilplaces of rebirth and from their false views. Thereafter ((f. 298b)) theywill establish them in the group of those whose destiny is not fixed eitherway; and after that they will again be reborn in the states of woe. It isthus that the Bodhisattva purifies the Buddha-field, with the result thatbeings will find no home in anything—worldly or supramundanedharmas, dharmas with or without outflows, conditioned or uncondi-tioned dnarmas—until they all become definitely destined for the supremeenlightenment.2i.e. both their bodies and their other possessions."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 78SKILL IN MEANS IN THE PURIFICATION OF THEBUDDHA-FIELDVIII 5,16.

It is likewise impossible that he should fall intothe false view that there is no karma or retribution. And it is also quiteimpossible that a Bodhisattva who, from the first thought of enlighten-ment onwards has resolutely set out for the supreme enlightenment,should commit himself to the ten unwholesome paths of action.Subhuti: If the Bodhisattva, thus endowed with wholesome roots,U.e. monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen."},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"622  AA VIII 5, 16  P 572is no longer reborn in the odious places of rebirth, how is it that the Tatha-gata has told about himself those Jataka stories in which he appearsas an animal? Whereto had those wholesome roots gone on thoseoccasions?The Lord: It is not as a result of insalubrious karma that the Bodhi-sattva is reborn as an animal. But he acquires, for the sake of beings,deliberately, of his own free will, any kind of body through which hecan work the weal of beings. Do Arhats or Pratyekabuddhas have thatskill in means ((f. 299a)) which would enable them to be reborn as animals?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: The Tathagata, however, has the skill in means whichenables him to be reborn there. And when confronted with those whostruggle to kill him, the Bodhisattva renounces himself with supremepatience for the sake of those very beings and does them no harm. Inthis way, Subhuti, you should know that the Bodhisattva, when for thesake of beings he fulfils the great compassion, is even on the way to hissupreme enlightenment reborn as an animal, but is not stained by thefaults of animal life.Subhuti: Having stood in which wholesome dharmas do Bodhisattvasacquire these kinds of bodies?The Lord: Which is the wholesome dharma that the Bodhisattvashould not fulfil? The supreme enlightenment is the fulfilment of allwholesome dharmas. Therefore there is not any wholesome dharmawhich the Bodhisattva should not fulfil—from the first thought ofenlightenment onward until he is seated on the terrace of enlightenment.For it is impossible for him to know the supreme enlightenment whileeven one single wholesome dharma has remained unfulfilled. Therefore,then, the Bodhisattva should, from the first thought of enlightenmentonward train in the fulfilment of all wholesome dharmas and, havingtrained therein, he reaches the knowledge of all modes and will forsakethe last residues of the defilements.Subhuti: How again is it that the Bodhisattva, when he is endowedwith such pure dharmas, with the holy dharma(s) without outflows, isreborn in the states of woe or among animals?The Lord: Is, then, the Tathagata holy and without outflows?Subhuti: He is, O Lord.The Lord: Can, then, the Tathagata conjure up an animal whichdoes his Buddha-work (for him)?Subhuti: He can, O Lord.The Lord: Does, then, the Tathagata become an animal?Subhuti: No, O Lord!The Lord: Does he, then, experience an animal's sufferings?Subhuti: No, O Lord!"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"/>572  AA VIII5, 16-17  623The Lord: It is thus that the Bodhisattva, endowed with the holyDharma without outflows, deliberately and of his own free will acquiresa body which enables him to mature beings suitably in accordance withtheir deserts.Subhuti: Can, then, an Arhat conjure up a fictitious magical creationwho can do the work of an Arhat, which generates joyous zest in others?The Lord: He can, Subhuti, he can. It is thus that a Bodhisattva.endowed with the Dharma which is holy and without outflows, acquiresdeliberately and of his own free will a body which allows him to do aBuddha's work for living beings. But through this body he does notbecome subject to suffering, nor does he experience painful feelings.What do you think, Subhuti, if a magician exhibits illusory beings,in the shape of elephants, horses, bulls, or any other illusory beings,do they then become actual elephants, horses, bulls, or any other animals?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: It is thus that the Bodhisattva becomes endowed with theDharma which is holy and without outflows, and acquires deliberatelyand of his own free will a body which enables him to work the weal ofbeings, but he does not experience the feelings which normally go with it.Subhuti: Greatly skilled in means, O Lord, is the Bodhisattva who,even when endowed with the holy cognition, acquires any body whichenables him to work the weal of beings.VIII 5,17. THE WEAL OF COUNTLESS BEINGS.In which pure dharmas has the Bodhisattva stood when ((f. 299b)) heperformed these kinds of skill in means, and yet was not stained byhis activities?The Lord: It is when he has stood in perfect wisdom that the Bodhi-sattva performs these kinds of skill in means, with the result that inall the directions and subdirections in countless world systems he doesthe work of beings. But he is not affected by anything anywhere. Andwhy? Because the Bodhisattva nowhere apprehends a dharma whichcould affect him, or whereby or wherein he could be affected. And why?Because all these three dharmas are empty of own-being. For emptinessdoes not affect emptiness, nor can any dharma affect emptiness, norcan emptiness he affected at all. And why? Because emptiness, beingempty in its own-being, cannot be apprehended in emptiness. This isthe emptiness without basis in which the Bodhisattva has stood beforehe knows full enlightenment.Subhuti: Has he just stood in perfect wisdom and not in other dharmas ?The Lord: Is there, then, any dharma which is not included in theperfection of wisdom?Subhuti: If perfect wisdom is through its own-being empty, how,"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"624  AA VIII 5, 17-18  P 572-573then, are all dharmas included in it?

THE VIRTUOUS ACTS WHICH CONSIST IN APPROACHING, TENDING,ETC. THE BUDDHAS.Subhuti: How does the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdomand has stood in the emptiness of all dharmas, conjure up the perfectionof superknowledges, which enables him to travel in the East, etc. to:countless world systems, to honour the Buddhas and Lords who stand,hold and maintain themselves in those world systems, and demonstratethe Dharma there, to hear the Dharma from them, and to plant wholesomeroots in the presence of those Buddhas and Lords?The Lord: Here, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom sees all the countless world systems in the East, etc. as empty.And the Buddhas and Lords who are in them are empty of own-being,and they can be described only by way of names and conventionalexpressions which rely on concepts. All these concepts, however, areempty of own-being. If those world systems were not empty of own-being,as well as those Buddhas and Lords and the habitual conceptions, thenthat emptiness would be only a limited one; but because emptiness isnot limited, therefore all dharmas are empty of all dharmas. In conse-quence the Bodhisattva who through his skill in means courses in theperfection of wisdom consummates the perfection of the superknowledges.Having stood in the superknowledges, he consummates the heavenlyeye, the heavenly ear, the magical powers, the cognition of others'thoughts and the knowledge of the decease and rebirth of beings. Andit is not without the superknowledges that a Bodhisattva can know thesupreme enlightenment, ((f. 301a)) Since therefore the enlightenmentof a Bodhisattva and the perfection of the superknowledges are mutuallyincluded within each other, one should strive to attain enlightenmentthrough just those superknowledges.In the process of doing so (the Bodhisattva) with his heavenly eyesees for himself those wholesome dharmas, and he enjoins them also onothers. But he does not settle down in these wholesome dharmas. Andwhy? Because they are all empty in their own-being. But on account of"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"p 573-574  A A VIII 5, 18  625emptiness one cannot settle down anywhere, or relish that in which onehas settled down. For emptiness cannot be relished. Therefore theBodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, consummates the heavenlyeye which enables him to see all dharmas as empty. Thereupon theBodhisattva, aware of the true dharmic situation, voluntarily performsthose deeds which enable him to demonstrate Dharma to beings, butwithout apprehending a being or the concept of a being. It is thus byway of basing himself on nothing at all that the Bodhisattva conjuresup the perfection of the superknowledges, and brings about all thedharmas which should be achieved through these superknowledges.And here the Bodhisattva, with his heavenly eye, purified, and surpassingthat of men, sees the world systems in all the directions, and with thehelp of his wonderworking powers he travels there and works the wealof beings, whether by giving or morality, etc. to : by the Buddhadharmashe does the work of those beings. And to beings who are stingy he de-monstrates Dharma as follows : 'Do give gifts! For poverty is a painfulthing. One is unable, when poor, to accomplish one's own welfare,much less that of others! In consequence you yourselves will suffer,and you will also make others suffer. May it not be that overpoweredby poverty you will be unable to free from the places of woe those whofeed on each other's flesh!' And to those who are immoral he demons-trates the Dharma as follows: 'Immorality, O you people, leads tosuffering. For through immorality one cannot accomplish one's ownwelfare, how much less that of others! The immoral will find their punish-ment in the hells, or in the world of animals, or in the world of Yama.Once you have been hurled into the three states of woe, you will beunable to accomplish your own welfare, how much less that of others!Therefore may you not give an opportunity to even one single thoughtof immorality, so that later on you may have no reason to repent!'And to those beings who feel ill will for one another he demonstratesDharma as follows: 'May you not feel ill will towards one another!For to those that have angry thoughts not one single wholesome dharmacan manifest itself. It is therefore quite certain that you who are angrytowards one another will be reborn in the hells, or the world of animals,or the world of Yama. May you not feel even one angry thought, howmuch less should you give an opportunity to other unwholesomethoughts!' He encourages the indolent to vigour, etc. to : he encouragesthose who have distracted thoughts to the practice of trance, and thestupid to wisdom, and those who course in greed he encourages tomeditate on the Unlovely, those who course in hate to the practice offriendliness, and ((f. 301b)) those who course in delusion to meditateon conditioned coproduction. Those who have set out on the wrongpath he encourages to the (right) path, whether it be that of the Disciples"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"626  A A VIII 5, 18  P 574or the Pratyekabuddhas. And he demonstrates Dharma to them asfollows: 'Those dharmas in which you have settled down, they areempty in their own-being. One cannot possibly settle down in dharmaswhich are empty of own-being. For emptiness is something in whichone cannot settle down'. It is thus that the Bodhisattva who coursesin perfect wisdom and who has stood in the superknowledges worksthe weal of beings. No Bodhisattva can demonstrate Dharma to beingswithout having first stood in the superknowledges. And it is quite im-possible that those who have strayed on to a wrong path can makeothers enter the (true) path. Just as a bird without wings cannot soarinto space, just so the Bodhisattva cannot demonstrate Dharma withoutresorting to the superknowledges. Therefore, then, a Bodhisattva whocourses in perfect wisdom should consummate the superknowledges.When he has done so, he makes those beings happy whose weal hedesires to work. With his heavenly eye he will see countless world systems,and also the beings who are reborn in them. With the help of his wonder-working powers he travels to them, wisely knows their thought withhis own thought, and in his wisdom he demonstrates the Dharma justas it is—be it a sermon on giving, etc. to: a sermon on release. Withhis heavenly ear-element he hears both kinds of sound, heavenly andhuman. He hears the dharmas which the Buddhas and Lords demons-trate in countless world systems, learns them as they are, and demons-trates them without introducing any falsehood into them—whetherthey be a sermon on giving, etc. to: a sermon on release.

THE LIMBS OF ENLIGHTENMENT.Subhuti: Which are the limbs of the path2 which a Bodhisattva fulfilsbefore he knows the supreme enlightenment?The Lord: All the wholesome dharmas are the limbs of the path2 ofthe Bodhisattva.Subhuti: What, then, are they?The Lord: From the first thought of enlightenment onwards theperfection of giving is such a wholesome dharma, when it is carriedout without false imaginations, and when one does not discriminatewith regard to the act of giving that 'this is the gift, to him I give, it is Iwho gives'. In fact one does not imagine any of these three, on accountof the emptiness of own-being. Through this perfection he saves himselfand rescues also others from the flood of Samsara. These are the whole-some dharmas which are a Bodhisattva's path to the supreme enlighten-ment, and it is by this path that the past, future, and present Bodhisattvashave been saved, are being saved, and will be saved from the flood ofSamsara, after they have taken with them countless other beings.

Just as the candidate is onething and the one who is established in the fruit is another, and yet theyare not both of them not holy persons, just so the Bodhisattva stands inthe place of a candidate to the unimpeded path, ((f. 302b)) whereasthe Tathagata has attained a state of nonblindness3 for all dharmas.This is the difference between the Bodhisattva on the one side and theTathagata on the other.Subhuti: If, however, these dharmas are empty of own-marks, howcan with regard to dharmas which are empty of own-marks a differenceor distinction be apprehended (to the effect that one says) 'this one is abeing in the hells, this one an animal, this one someone in the world ofYama, this one a god, this one a human, this one is on the stage wherehe becomes one of the clan, etc. to: this one is a Tathagata.'

In respect of dharmaswhich are empty of own-marks no karma or karma result can be apprehen-ded. But when those too ignorant to cognize dharmas as empty of own-marks manufacture a karma—be it badly done or well done, with orwithout outflows—then, through badly done karma they are hurledinto the three states of woe, through what is well done they are rebornamong gods and men, and through flawless karma they are reborn in theworld of form and the formless world.

When that weal has been worked, he neveragain forgets (what he has learned) and in consequence he cannot behurled again into the Samsara with its five places of rebirth.Subhuti: Has, then, the Lord, when he has fully known the supremeenlightenment, apprehended Samsara with its five places of rebith?The Lord: Certainly not!Subhuti: Has, then, the Lord apprehended the dharmas which areblack, white, or both black and white?The Lord: Certainly not!Subhuti: If they have not been apprehended, how could he conceiveof the hells, the world of animals, etc. to: the Streamwinner, etc. to:the Tathagata?The Lord: Do, then, those beings cognize all dharmas as empty ofown-marks?Subhuti: Certainly not!The Lord: If those beings were to cognize that 'all dharmas are emptyof own-marks', then the Bodhisattva would not set out for the supremeenlightenment and in consequence he would not set beings free from thethree states of woe, etc. to : from Samsara with its (five) places of rebirth.But because beings do not cognize dharmas as empty of own marksthey are not set free from Samsara with its five places of rebirth.

In these four holy truths are included all whole-some dharmas as well as those dharmas which act as wings to enlighten-ment and through which the respective determination of the threeTreasures takes place. Which three? The treasure of Buddha, Dharma,and Samgha. Through the manifestation of these three treasures beingsare liberated from Samsara with its five places of rebirth.Subhuti: Does, then, Parinirvana take place through the cognition ofill or through ill, through the cognition of origination or through origi-nation, through the cognition of the stopping of ill or through the stoppingof ill, through the cognition of the path or through the path?The Lord: Parinirvana does not take place through any of these. Butit is the sameness of the four holy Truths which I have taught as Pari-nirvana.Subhuti: What, then, is the sameness of the four holy truths?The Lord: It is where there is no ill nor cognition of ill, no originationnor cognition of origination, no stopping nor cognition of stopping,no path nor cognition of the path—the Suchness of those holy truths, theirnonfalseness, their Dharmahood, (i.e.) the Dharma-element, fixedsequence of Dharma, stability of Dharma. It is the element, i.e. theDharma-element which is firmly established whether Tathagatas areproduced or not, and conduces to the (dharaiic state which is) undeludedand never fails. Thus it is that a Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom courses towards the understanding of the truths. And yet thetruths are not something that should be understood.Subhuti: And how again does the Bodhisattva who courses in perfectwisdom course towards the understanding of the truths? As he coursesso he understands the truths, and when he has fully known them he pene-trates to (their) Thusness, with the result that he does not fall on the levelof a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha, but enters on a Bodhisattva's specialway of salvation.The Lord: Here the Bodhisattva, who courses in perfect wisdom,does not see those dharmas in such a way that, when seeing them, heapprehends any dharma whatever. Not apprehending them he seesthat 'all dharmas are empty'. He sees that they are all empty, whetherthey are included in the truths or not included in them. When he viewsthings in this way, the Bodhisattva who enters on a Bodhisattva's specialway of salvation becomes established on the stage of those who havebecome one of the Bodhisattva-clan, and as a result he cannot fall fromthe Summits ((f. 303b)) unto the level of a Disciple or Pratyekabuddha.Having stood on the level of the Bodhisattva-clan, he produces the fourtrances, the four Unlimited, and the four formless attainments.

Through this kind of insighthe discerns that 'all dharmas are empty'. Not of any dharma does he seean own-being which would provide him with an existent on which hehas stood when fully knowing enlightenment.Subhuti: Is, then, enlightenment nonexistent?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is, as you say. Enlightenment alsois a nonexistent. It has not been made by Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, orArhats, nor by those Bodhisattvas who here course towards enlighten-ment.

What do you think, Subhuti, when someone seessomething in a dream does he see an entity on which he could base hisenjoyment of the five sense pleasures?Subhuti: The dream, to begin with, is not—how much less that onwhich the dreamer could base his enjoyment of the five sense pleasures!The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, is there a dharma—condi-tioned or unconditioned, with or without outflows—which is not like adream?Subhuti: No, there is not.The Lord: Does Samsara with its five places of rebirth exist in adream?Subhuti: No, O Lord.The Lord: What do you think, Subhuti, does there take place in adream the development of the path, thanks to which one would beneither defiled nor purified?Subhuti: No, O Lord.

And bymeans of what is not actually real one cannot fully know the supremeenlightenment after one has coursed in the six perfections, etc. to: inthe eighteen special dharmas of a Buddha.The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. All these dharmas are contrivedactivities, planned and willed, and through them the knowledge of allmodes cannot be reached. All these dharmas serve to bring near thepath and to produce it, but do not lead to the obtainment of the fruit.For the nonproduction and nonmanifestation of these dharmas meansthat they are without marks. Therefore from the first thought of enlighten-ment onwards the Bodhisattva continues to exert himself in wholesomedharmas, be it the perfection of giving, etc. to: the special Buddha-dharmas. And he cognizes all this as a magical illusion. Without havingfulfilled those dharmas one cannot mature beings. Therefore the Bodhi-sattva, who courses in perfect wisdom, cognizes as like a dream, etc.to: as like a magical creation each and every wholesome dharma inwhich he exerts himself. When he courses in perfect wisdom he cognizeseverything up to the knowledge of all modes as like a dream, etc. Hecognizes that all these beings are moving about in a dream, etc. Thereforethe Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom does not seize on dream-like dharmas, etc. to: on dharmas which are like magical creations,as either existent or nonexistent, and when he has done so he reachesthe knowledge of all modes. For unseizable is the perfection of wisdomand so is everything up to the eighteen special Buddhadharmas. Thereforethe Bodhisattva, having known all dharmas as unseizable, strives afterthe supreme enlightenment. And why? Because all dharmas are unseiz-ble, nonentities, like a dream, etc. to : like a magical creation, ((f. 306a))But one cannot reach an unseizable dharma through an unseizable dharma,except for beings who do not cognize or see these dharmas. Thereforethe Bodhisattva sets out for the supreme enlightenment for the sakeof all beings. From the first thought of enlightenment onwards, whatevergift he gives, etc. to: whatever wisdom he develops, he does so for thesake of all beings and not for the sake of his own self. It is exclusively forthe sake of all beings that he sets out for the supreme enlightenment.When he courses in perfect wisdom he dissuades from their pervertedviews those who have perceived a being in what is not a being, a selfin what is not the self, etc. to : a viewer in what is not a viewer, and there-after he establishes them in the deathless element where these habitualconcepts, such as the notion of self, etc. no longer proceed. When hehas given up all these tendencies to make affirmations and negationsabout objects, and all these restless tremulations of intellectual multipli-city, he dwells with a heart which does not mind anything as one whohas achieved much. It is by this device that the Bodhisattva, when he"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"638  AA VIII 5, 25  P 588courses in perfect wisdom, does not himself settle down in any dharmawhatever and establishes also all beings in the avoidance of settling down—by way of worldly convention, and not by way of ultimate reality.Subhuti: That Dharma which has been fully known by the Tathagata,has that been fully known by way of worldly convention, or by way ofultimate reality?The Lord: By way of worldly convention one says that 'this Dharmahas been fully known by the Tathagata'. But when one says that 'thisdharma has been fully known by that dharma' one really gets hold ofnothing. And why? It would be a basis if one were to say that 'throughthis dharma has that dharma been fully known'. And through dualitythere can be no attainment or reunion.Subhuti: If through duality there is no attainment and no reunion, isthere, then, an attainment and reunion through nonduality?The Lord: There is no attainment or reunion through either duality ornonduality; there can be attainment and reunion only where there isneither duality nor nonduality. And why? Because they would otherwiseimply an intellectual multiplicity. But in the sameness of Dharma thereis no intellectual multiplicity, for the nature of Dharma is withoutintellectual multiplicity.Subhuti: What is the sameness of Dharma in respect of dharmaswhich all have nonexistence for own-being?The Lord: The sameness of Dharma is where there is no existent, nononexistent, no own-being, and no doctrinal statement. For about thesameness of Dharma no doctrinal statement is possible. Since outsidethe sameness of Dharma no dharma can be apprehended, the sameness ofDharma has transcended all dharmas. The sameness of Dharma isinaccessible to anyone, be they fools or holy men, and it lies outsidetheir range.Subhuti: Does, then, the sameness of Dharma lie outside the rangealso of the Tathagata?The Lord: It lies outside the range of all holy men, ((f. 306b)) includingthe Tathagatas.Subhuti: Does, then, the Tathagata not have sovereignty over therange of all dharmas?The Lord: The Tathagata would be a sovereign over the range of alldharmas if the sameness of Dharma were one thing and the Tathagataanother. But the dharmic sameness of the common people, and that ofthe Streamwinners, etc. to: of the Tathagatas, that is just one singlesameness, and in this sameness there is not any difference. Since thesameness of the common people and that of all holy men is just onesingle sameness, there is no duality in it, (so that one could say that)'this is a common person', etc. to : 'this is, a Tathagata'.

In the sameness of all dharmasthere is no difference between these various kinds of persons.Subhuti: If that is so, wherefrom, then, is there the manifestation inthe world of the three Treasures, i.e. the Buddha, Dharma, and Samgha?The Lord: Is the treasure of the Buddha one thing, the treasure of theDharma another, the treasure of the Samgha another, and the samenessof Dharma again another?Subhuti: As I understand the meaning of the Lord's teaching, thetreasure of the Buddha is not one thing, the treasure of the Dharmaanother, the treasure of the Samgha another, and the sameness of Dharmaanother. But the three Treasures are just the sameness of Dharma. Allthese dharmas are not conjoined or disjoined, they are immaterial,undefinable, nonresisting, with one mark only, i.e. no mark. How, then,can the Lord bring about3 with regard to these markless dharmas adistinctive determination between common persons, Streamwinners,etc. to: Tathagatas?The Lord: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. It is within the range of the Tatha-gata's power, it is the work of the Tathagata's manly competence, thathe brings about a distinctive determination of markless dharmas.
