He resides in forests and is horrible. He is windy in temperament and is intelligent. Ketu is akin to Rahu.” BPHS Ch. 3, Shloka 41-44: “Rahu rules the outcaste while Ketu governs mixed caste. ... Rahu denotes multi-colored clothes and Ketu rags. Lead and blue gem belong to Rahu and Ketu.” KETURAHUSo u t hno de o fRAHU & KETU : THE NORTH & SOUTHNODES OF THE MOON BPHS, Chapter 3, verse 30:” Rahu has smoke like blue body, lives in forests and is horrible. He is windy in temperament and is intelligent. Like Rahu is Ketu.” The Moons apparent path intersects the ecliptic obliquely at two points called the nodes. The point where the Moon crosses the ecliptic from south to north is called the ascending node or Rahu, where it crosses the ecliptic from north to south is called descending node or Ketu. These two points are 180 degrees apart and their movement is constantly retrograde, meaning, against the normal direction of movement of planets. Rahu and Ketu are given special status and considered as planets in Indian astrology. Rahu and Ketu take approximately eighteen years and ten days to complete one round of the zodiac . In Hindu mythology, Rahu is a snake that swallows the sun or the moon causing eclipses. He is depicted in art as a dragon with no body riding a chariot drawn by eight black horses. Rahu is one of the navagrahas (nine planets) in Vedic astrology. The rahu kala is considered inauspicious. According to legend, during the Samudra manthan, the asura Rahu drank some of the divine nectar. But before the nectar could pass his throat, Mohini (the female avatar of Vishnu) cut off his head. The head, however, remained immortal. It is believed that this"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 5immortal head occasionally swallows the sun or the moon, causing eclipses. Then, the sun or moon passes through the opening at the neck, ending the eclipse. Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denotes the two points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. The fact that Eclipses occur when Sun and Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the myth of the swallowing of the Sun. Surya Grahan, solar eclipse, is widely mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of Hinduism. There is also an interesting myth regarding the occurrence of Surya Grahan. It happened during the Samdura Manthan (churning of ocean) episode in the Puranas. Rahu (Demon) and Mohini, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, are the main characters in the incident. The Amrit (elixir) that was obtained from churning the ocean was cunningly stolen by Ausras (Demons). Lord Vishnu took the form of Mohini, a beautiful damsel, to win back the Amrit. She achieved her mission by enamoring the Asuras, they fell for her beauty and handed over the Amrit to her. Mohini returned to the Devas and started distributing it. Devas sat in a line and mohini gave a portion to each one of them. Rahu, an Asura, who found out that they were tricked took the form a Deva and sat in the line between Chandra (Moon God) and Surya (Sun God). The asura Rahu drank some of the divine nectar. When Mohini approached Rahu, Chandra and Surya realized that Rahu was not one among them and soon identified him as an Asura. Mohini soon severed the head of Rahu which flew into the sky. The head, however, remained immortal and is called Rahu , while the rest of the body became Ketu. It is believed that this immortal head occasionally swallows the sun or the moon, causing eclipses. Rahu is depicted in the form of a Snake and continued to live and decided to avenge Surya and Chandra. Thus, periodically Rahu engages in a war with Surya and Chandra. The Chandra Grahan (Lunar eclipse) and Surya Grahan (Solar eclipse) takes place when Rahu gobbles up Moon and Sun respectively. Surya and Chandra then fights to free themselves. Ketu is the Lord of Descending/South lunar node. Ketu is generally referred to as a \"shadow\" planet. He is considered as Tail of the Demon Snake. It is believed to have a tremendous impact on human lives and also the whole creation. In some special circumstances it helps someone achieve the zenith of fame. He is Tamas in nature and represents supernatural influences. Phaladeepika, Adhyaya II, Sloka 35 : “Lead and an old garment belong to Rahu while a mud vessel and a mixed cloth of variegated colour have been allotted to Ketu.Mercury, Saturn and Venus are the friends of Rahu as well as Ketu. Mars is natural to them. The rest are enemies.” Manik Chand Jain on Rahu & Ketu in Predictive Astrology, page 82, writer: “Rahu has the influence of Jupiter conjunction Venus."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 6It gives intense appreciation and respect for the area by house where Rahu is located or transiting. There is popularity in this place with optimism and cheerfulness. This is a lucky place. .... Ketu has the influence of a Mars conjunct Saturn. In Ketu, too much of the Saturn accent can produce fear and hold the Mars action back. This can give poor timing. Mars represents energy and Saturn, a cycle of time. With the Combination, we need to take stock of the issues involved, and do something about them. There is an ambition for power where Ketu is located by house. The trick is to use the energy of Mars in the right amount by the disciplining of Saturn in an area of selfless service rather than over-possessiveness.” Barbara Pijan Lama: What are Rahu & Ketu? “Rahu & Ketu are two psycho-magnetic zones opposite each other, on our Moon's orbit path around Earth. They reside where the Moon's path intersects the plane of the ecliptic, called the \"rashi chakra\" [\"circle of signs\"]. • Rahu is the \"North Node of the Moon\" = Dragon's Head = Caput Draconis. • Ketu is the \"South Node of the Moon\" = Dragon's Tail = Cauda Draconis. Rahu, Ketu, Dhuma, are called \"chhaaya grahaa\" or \"shadow planets\" because they have similar effects to planets, but they have no gravity or mass. [\"Planet\" means \"wanderer\".] Rahu/Ketu (who work always as a pair) move \"backwards\" through the rashi chakra, in direction opposite to Moon and Sun.” Barbara Pijan Lama: The destruction and rejuvenation of the human body: - Rahu destroys the physical body while Ketu creates the physical body, Rahu is associated with intense desires (including obsessions) which are energetic overloads for the physical body, thus Rahu is a destructive force. - Ketu actually creates and maintains the physical body by anti-doting or negating the effects of desire. Das Goravani, in his writing about the nodes says: \"Every planet has two nodes relative to Earth. However, due to our Moon's extraordinary proximity to Earth, the Moon's nodes are said by the ancient rishis to have especially powerful implications for life on our little blue planet. Each planet has got its own ascending and descending nodes except the Sun.... Generally the point of the Zodiac, where a planet crosses from the south to north latitude is the ascending node and the point of the Zodiac where a planet crosses from the north latitude to south latitude is called the descending node.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 7RAHU AND KETU :The Great Churners Rahu is called \"the great churner of the oceans of milk\". Rahu is expansive, like Jupiter, but in chaotic and weird ways. Rahu releases long-suppressed desires from past lives. Rahu is the excitement of desire - usually desire for something that is very new, forbidden, unprecedented, or challenges established tradition. After Rahu's desire is released and made manifest the excitement fades as yang swings to yin and Ketu induces apathy. Ketu has \"been there, done that\" attitude which is often the mask for exhaustion and frustration. Rahu is our powerful to brings past-life desires and fantasies into material form in this life. Rahu is the force of passion and desire. A person with a strong Rahu is considered to have built up lots of tantric powers from previous incarnations which grant the spiritual power and permission to change stored subconscious imagery into conscious imagery, and through the power of desire, to manifest that image on the material plane. I.e., to have a five-senses, real-life experience rather than just a daydream or a hope. Rahu is very powerful because desire is a very powerful thing!! Ketu is Rahu's diametrically opposite force. Rahu is permissive and expansive like Venus and Jupiter, but Ketu is restrictive and like Shani and Mars. Whereas Rahu is passionate and desirous, Ketu is detached and meditative. The house, degree, sign, aspects, and other characteristics of Ketu show imagery that has already been manifested by Rahu, that we are finished desiring and now wish to separate from ourselves. Wherever Ketu is, there the person is detached, impassionate, cool-tempered, and unconcerned with the development of those matters. Ketu is a manifestation of Shri Ganesha, the elephant-headed god who is cheerful, slow-moving, and above it all. Rahu gives insatiable yearning hunger, while Ketu gives detachment, disconnection, and despair. Cycling between these two nodes, during intense periods, one may temporarily feel like the victim of an unstoppable boomerang cycle of primal need and utter abandonment. Rahu's attachment cycle to experience, possess, and control reaches its natural extreme; then starts Ketu's reverse detachment cycle creating despair, impossibility to be loved or accepted, unworthiness proven by rejection. This cycle can make a person absolutely miserable on the ego level. The Signs in which Rahu and Ketu are less weird: Rahu and Ketu are always weird. • Ruling or occupying good houses like 1, 5 or 9 doesn't make them any less weird. Rahu-Ketu can be helpful if they are positioned this way: 1. No aspects on either node from Mars or Saturn 2. Rahu acts better when Saturn is good by house and sign (\"Shani vat Rahu\") 3. Ketu acts better when Mars is good by house and sign (\"Bhaum vat Ketu cha\") 4.

Rahu behaves better in Virgo and best in Gemini 6. Ketu behaves better in Pisces and best in Sagittarius The Nodal People \"Very nodal people\" are: • Radix nodes in lagna • Radix nodes yuti Chandra • Navamsha nodes in D-9 lagna • Radix nodes conjunct navamsha lagna • Navamsha nodes conjunct Radix lagna \"Very nodal people\" will be involved with \"foreign-ness\" to a dramatic degree in their lives. The distinctive foreign components may be foreign ideas, foreign spouse or romance, foreign business or travel, or foreign adoption children, foreign appearance. Rahu-Ketu transits essentially Reorganize the Personality, by opening the consciousness to a previously undetected level of past-life information. This information arises while reconnecting (usually very intensely) with a person, place, or knowledge base from a previous incarnation. (Thus the obsessive connection to things which are \"foreign\" in this life.) Rahu/Ketu effects are felt much more strongly during periods of Rahu or Ketu \"Triple-whammy\" effects can be predicted for the native whose nodes rise in either radix or navamsha, when their Vimshottari Dasha gives a Rahu/Ketu bhukti. This period will dramatically change the individual's definition of him/herself, due to new psychic information, which breaks through from the subconscious storage zone. Rahu-Ketu transiting the Radix affects the physical body/Material Plane. For example, nodes crossing the 1/7 axis in Radix may generate a pregnancy or induce surgery. Rahu-Ketu transiting the navamsha affects the astral body (relationships). For example, modes crossing the 1/7 axis or a nodal return within navamsha often bring a dramatic relationship. Often there is a long psychic build-up period, such a partners dreaming about each other before meeting, or a strong but taboo attraction, or other dramatic circumstances which are not so much in the physical body, but predominantly on the astral.

The lords ofKendra and Kona houses, if not conjoined with the two nodes, produces beneficial results. The effects will be contrary, if they be other node these two nodes in spite of their malefic nature becoming benefic by virtue of their position in certain houses or association with certain planets. (2) If one of the two nodes and the lord of a Trikona be posited in the 9th or 10th, or if one of them be in the 9th or the other in the 10th or vice versa, the yoga will cause prosperity to the native. Even a conjunction of either of these with the lord of a trikona will prove beneficial. In the above circumstances the paras of these two nodes as well as these of the planets conjoined with them will prove happy. If there be a planet who is inauspicious associated by a sum of Sambhandha (relationship) with either of the nodes, then the Bhukti of the yogakarka planet will prove adverse. (3) The two planet.- Rahu and Ketu become auspicious when they occupy a Trikona or Kendra position or when they are associated with the lord of that particular kendra or kona house in which they are posited. They also prove beneficial when they conjoin with the lords of any Kendra or Kona house. If the lord of the 9th were to own the 8th or 12th as well, or if the lord of 9th and the 10th in the above circumstances were to conjoin with the lords of the 9th or the 12th, then the auspiciousness of the Yoga is lost. 9) RAHU – THE ASCENDING NODE OF THE MOON: \"Caput Draconis - The Dragon's Head\" UTTARAKALAMRITA M, SECTION 5: Slokas 51-52 Relating to Action, Function or Doing of Rahu: (1) Umbrella (2) chowrie (3) kingdom (4) gathering (5) fallacious argument (6) a wounding speech (7) one belonging to the lowest caste (8) a wicked, female (9) a vehicle bordered on all sides (10) an i religious man (11) gambling (12) strong at twilight (13) intrigue with a wicked female (14) going to a foreign country (15) impurity (16) bone (17) enlargement of spleen (18) false¬hood (19) downward look (20) perplexity (21) an emerald (22) facing the Southern quarter (23) resorting to outcastes or other low people (24) a bad swelling (25) a big forest (26) moving in a contrary direction (27) mountain (28) pain (29) staying 0utside (30) inclined towards South-west (31) wind (32) phlegm (33) sorrow (34) serpent (35) night wind (36) severe (37) long (38) reptile (3 ) reading of dreams (40) travel (41) a Muhurta (42) old age (43) a vehicle (14) world of serpents (45) mother (46) father o grandfather (47) air (48) an acute or sharp pain (49) catarrh (50) breathing (51) great courage (52) forest (53) fortress (54) worshipper (55) wickedness (56) cohabitation with - quadrupeds (57) writing of Urdu and (58) harsh --speech.

Phaladeepika , ADHYAYA – II, Sloka 33 : Rahu is black in colour, tall in stature and of a low caste; he has got skin-disease; he is a heretic; he has got hic-cough; he speaks falsehood; he is cunning; he suffers from leprosy; he reviles others and is devoid of intelligence."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 13 Jataka Parijata: • Rahu has a body black in appearance. • [He is represented by] a person of a hundred years. • [His stone is] Agate. • [His direction is] South-west. • [He lingers in] the corners of the house. • Rahu causes great fear to men by means of epilepsy, smallpox, halter, flies, worms, ghosts, fiends and goblins, and also by leading to suicides by hanging, because of diseases resulting in lack of appetite and leprosy. • One ought to guess about one's paternal grandfather through Rahu. In Mesha, Vrischikha, Kumbha, Kanya, Vrishabha, Kataka, and in the tenth house, from the lagna, Rahu has strength. Jataka Parijata, Ch. 2, ln. 81: “Rahu causes great fear to men by means of epilepsy, smallpox, halter, flies, worms, ghosts, fiends and goblins, & also by leading to suicides by hanging, because of diseases resulting in want of appetite and leprosy.” B. V. Raman, Three Hundred Important Combinations. p.211, Bahuputra Yoga: “It is only in the Navamsha of Saturn that Rahu's disposition is held to be harmful.” Rahu/Shani conjunction, any rashi: • If Rahu has higher degree, the \"shadow\" or the shamanic membrane will dominate Shani. Shani's job is to keep order. (Shani rules time and space, the Law, all structures including Clans and Bones.) The \"shadow's\" job is to shape-shift and show hidden forces. The person will need to find a way to package their shamanic knowledge so that conventional society can understand psychic truths -- which is a mighty task! Early years are bound to be heavy with social criticism, imprisonment, contempt. However with other good planets, person might emerge in later years as a powerful authority. The key with this combination is *time.* Person must be allowed to mature emotionally, and early dashas must support life. • If Saturn has higher degree, shamanic perceptions of Rahu are compressed inside of Saturn. The combination is classically associated with mental/emotional illness. Remember when Peter Pan was robbed of his shadow? He could not find himself. Here the shamanic forces are shackled to for forces of social control. The person knows they don't fit in to the mainstream, but they are not empowered to seek alternative societies - psychic congregations, healing networks - which might provide much-needed validation. Compressed visionary energy may periodically erupt into anti-social activity. Vedic Symbolism of Rahu – the North Node of the Moon"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 14 Many references are found in Hindu Mythology and Vedic spiritual literature about the Nodes of the Moon. Rahu is also known as Ahi, which means a serpent or dragon, the Sun, the demon Vritra, a thief, a scoundrel, or a cloud. In the Vedas Rahu is invoked as a demon named Svarbhanu, who devours the luminaries to cause the eclipse. Rahu is also connected with poison used both for destructive and regenerative purposes. The regeneration of the Moon after the solar eclipse indicates the regenerative power of Rahu. Being the son of a lioness, Rahu has the nature and consciousness of the lion. Rahu represents the active or male potency of Shakti, the female reproductive power in nature, Durga, the feminine counterpart of Shiva also rides a lion. As a serprent, Rahu pervades the entire body of Shiva who controls the gods and demons alike. Rahu ws used by the demons as well as the gods in the churning of the cosmic ocean. The close association of Lord Shiva and Rahu emphasizes the mystic nature of Rahu for the bestowal of inner knowledge. Vedc hymns invoke Rahu as “adorned with sandal paste, flowers and an umbrella, of blue colour, armed with a sword and shield, seated facing south and ssurrounded by all siddhis.” Naga or serpent is also one of the names of Rahu, and the name in the Hindu pantheon of the Dragon Sopirit who inhibits the nether world, Patala Loka. The four hands of Rahu indicate the instruments with which it manifests itself. 1) A scimitar – a short saber with a curved, sharp edged blade broadening from the handle. 2) A spear used for hunting and fighting. 3) A shield used to protect oneself. 4) The fourth hand bestows blessings on his devotees. Rahu is an ever wise deity endowed with extraordinary magic power. He is the presiding spirit of the god of the five regions (the four directions of the compass and the centre as the fifth), The priucipal function of Rahu is to arouse spiritual awareness by making the individual aware of his immeasurable latent faculties. Until this understanding dawns the individual is troubled by the influence of the graha. Rahu rides a chariot of eight horses, who are black in colour and eternally yoked to it. Rahu has thirty two sons called Ketus, implying thereby that they are like comets. Rahu seated in the chariot signifies the important position it is assigned among the planets. A similar status is indicated by assigning to it an umbrella of protection of higher forces. The significance of Rahu’s eight horses is found in Hindu mythology where similar allusions are made regarding Shiva where there are eight incarnations of Shiva to enable the cosmic manifestation to proceed to the right course. They represent the eight aspects of creative energy. They are 1) Sharva to go or to kill 2) Bhava birth or acquisition 3) Rudra  dreadful 4) Ugra fierce or violence 5) Bhima  the formidable 6) Pashupati the herdsman or owner of cattle 7) Ishana the ruler or master8 8) Mahadeva Supreme Shiva himself These aspects of the Supreme Lord form earth, water, fire, air, ether, the indwelling soul and the Sun and the Moon, which are also eight in number and constitute the manifest existence. Shiva in his cosmic creative role is assisted by eight Bhairavas or terrible ones who are said to be frightful, horrible and formidable, who are his different limbs. They are"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 15Shiva, Bhaya (fear), Bhayanaka Rasa (the fearful dramatic mood), a specific river, a special musical composition, a special rhythm in music, a jackal and a specific mountain. All these Bhiravas represent the eight horses of black colour that draw the chariot of Rahu. Emblematically, Rahu is represented by two small circles linked by a larger semicircle curving upwards. This stands for the potential contained in man the Divie potential for its actualization. Rahu represents the great cyclical law related to the rejuvenating and regenerating process. Rahu is the messenger of the great cyclic law of manifestation whose mission is to work under the direction of a still higher law, with the assistance and cooperation of many cosmic forces. Rahu’s Profile by Barbara Pijan Lama : Rahu is the Reptile Brain with Passion, Entitlement & Desire. - Rahu is never satisfied. • Rahu is always working overtime, trying to receive validation in a role for which He is unqualified. Rahu is always scheming a new approach toward getting what He is not entitled to have. • Rahu is an embezzler, slowly leeching the life force consciousness as He pursues an endless series of hot but fleeting material desires. • His methods are devious and surreptitious, driven by a deep hunger for validation through the experience of Possession, which is never satisfied. - Rahu is an interloper, a fraud, and a poseur. :Rahu wants to be included in the world of the gods. But, Rahu is not a real deity. Rahu sneaks in through trickery. - Rahu is a wanna-be. :He mainly tries to be attractive like Shukra. However, Rahu will shape-shift to imitate any graha who is His co-tenant or His Lord. - Rahu is illegitimate, a taboo-breaker.:The planetary gods do not recognize or accept Rahu. Vishnu was insulted and enraged when He saw Rahu lift the cup of Amrita to those snake-like lips. Vishnu flung His diamond-sharp discus across the room and sliced Rahu in half, instantly, for his crime. But Rahu is for obvious reasons associated with scandal, taboo-breaking, excess, etc. so \"skillful\" is really the key. - Rahu is always malefic in some sense, even when His contribution makes the native's life more vigorous, interesting, & colorful than would conventionally be allowed. The bhava occupied by Rahu becomes a site for sudden changes, sometimes catastrophic. - The nature of the catastrophe is known via Rahu's lord. When Rahu's lord is a highly impressionable graha like Chandra or Budha, the lord of the lord will be a causative agent also. - Rahu breaks social boundaries on Sex, Death, and other Taboos. Rahu gives the spirit emotional permission to break taboos & manifest passions long suppressed in the subconscious. Because social moral codes are essentially systems of taboo-management, taboo-crossing Rahu is associated with breakdown of the moral code."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 16- Rahu represents a foreigner, one who is polluted, a taboo-breaker, who looks or behaves in a strange or peculiar way, one who deals in vulgar or forbidden substances, or things that have been used by others and thus carry a hidden cargo of others' psychic imagery. - Rahu's portfolio includes psychic pollution from wearing others' clothes or handling \"recycled\" items such as animal teeth, horns, skins. Forbidden substances typically include human blood, corpses, and offal, but each culture has its own unique proscriptions. (E,g., meat or alcohol for some; lying, profanity, or varieties of sexual behavior for others.) Rahu represents whatever the home culture holds as 'taboo' - If Rahu is associated with a malefic graha, the person subconsciously remembers the ill-effects of breaking taboos in past lives, when they likely were driven out into the wilderness by their angry tribe - and died. - For other people, Rahu is almost blissfully high adventure. - If Rahu is associated with a benefic graha, the person subconsciously remembers the glamorous effects of expanding their tribes boundaries in a socially appreciated way. For example, the taboo on exotic marriages does not apply to royalty, who frequently marry foreigners to gain alliances for their tribe. A person carrying positive past-life memories of a tribe-pleasing foreign bond or shamanic funeral where all the evil spirits came and were dispersed, will be much more likely to enjoy Rahu periods in the current life. - Rahu is a disturber of the Moon which means He is a disturber of Manas, the Mind : Chandra rules hopes dreams emotions fear aspirations imagery and all the other ocean of mental-emotional experience which is Manas. Chandra rules a huge territory! - Rahu creates a psychic gateway, through which miraculous and/or catastrophic changes emerge. - Rahu releases subconsciously stored desires. These desires were often rather violently suppressed in past lives because it was impossible, inappropriate, or dangerous to manifest them in the old life. In the current life, when Rahu becomes strong, the desire resurges powerfully, \"sprung\" with the full force of long suppression. - Rahu creates obsessive-compulsive behavior, passions, OBSESSIONS. His special forte is sexuality & money, jealousy & greed. - Rahu is responsible for sudden, impulsive marriages. In relationships, Rahu can function as Venus's \"evil twin\" - causing us to mistake hormonally-driven passion for enduring love. In romance, under Rahu's influence, one may become obsessed by a person, idea, substance or pattern that you know is bad for you - but the addiction or obsession is so powerful that one becomes utterly enslaved. - During its reign as mahadasha/bhukti-pati, Rahu will \"light up\" its rashi sign within navamsha. E.g., if Rahu occupies Simha in radix, then Rahu's period's will \"wake up\" Simha's house in the navamsha too. Rahu's navamsha rashi should define how your romantic & sexual passions will be running during Rahu."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 17- Rahu's bhukti always disturbs some aspect of life. However, if Rahu is yuti a good planet it can also magnify the good planet's effects. - Rahu Dasha is time of material fulfillment for Taurus and Libra lagna. [Shani rules] Fortune-fulfilling houses 5, 9, or 10. - Rahu conjunct any other planets hugely amplifies that other planet. With sensual planets like needy Moon, self-indulgent Venus, permissive Jupiter, or the willful Sun, Rahu gives a passionate intensity to the sensual quest. Not always accomplishment, but always desire. - Rahu also amplifies its house owner. If house owner is Saturn or Mars, great need for self-knowledge in order to manage the desires not have the desires manage you. - Rahu dasha is time of material fulfillment when Rahu itself *resides* in house 5, 9, or 10. See this chart of successful attorney who experienced blossoming of legal literary accomplishments, publications, children, and success in litigation during Rahu's 18-yr dasha. [Note strong Rahu in 5 with L-2 Jupiter, lord of two kendras. - Rahu in 5th house is generally harmful to children. Will deny children if Rahu occupies a barren sign - those ruled by Budha and Shani. In all other signs the children will often develop willfulness, have social-adaptive blockages, and may - exhibit shamanistic tendencies to \"push the envelope\" which marginalize the children socially. However usually there are compensating effects from other good planets. - Rahu in 5 & 9 with no aspects gives a passion for truth which goes into writing books. - Male Energy, Sun's Enemy Rahu :Surya is a source of energetic outgoing hot Male Energy; Moon is the opposite, incoming cool Female Energy. (Not to be confused with anatomical male bodies, which run a combination of Male and Female energies.) - Rahu is inherently difficult for individuals who depend heavily on social approval through conformity. - Rahu is inherently exhilarating & creative for people who are naturally independent and thrive on materializing long-held desires through creativity. - Rahu the Darkener who causes eclipse of Surya is the greatest enemy of the Sun. Rahu symbolizes destruction of Dharma. (In traditional India, Surya signifies a woman's husband; Rahu brings widowhood.) - Rahu is anti-conformist. It is said that the two strongest human desires are (1) to mate and (2) to conform. So you can see how Rahu has developed a reputation as a serious malefic. He prevents a person from conforming to social taboo. Rahu's job is to push passions to the surface.

It is also found, contrary to general belief, that planets like the Sun and Mercury, occupying Rahu's constellations are capable of conferring happy results financially and career-wise but would create situations in domestic life, which could shatter a person's self-confidence and make him experience results which he would ordinarily never expect to happen.

Yet, the native is by nature emotionally fluctuating & changing every day. Highly unstable parent. Will often make a great display of parenting, or patriotism, or both - but the display is intended to attract attention and create opportunities for deeper sensual experience. It is not a display of contentment. Can develop a parent complex, taking care of everyone within reach. Has a special attraction to those who are 'separated' from their roots: destitute, homeless, and stateless. Can become extremely focused on protecting their family, home and homeland from invaders - psychic or physical. Yet, the native also seeks public validation of the parenting role, in which the native feels unstable. Rahu is an interloper, fraud, and poseur who wants to be included in the world of the gods. But, He is illegitimate in that world. Thus Rahu is always working overtime, trying to receive validation in a role for which He is unqualified. His methods are devious and surreptitious, driven by a deep hunger for validation which is never satisfied.

Rahu does well in lagna & in dushtana & upachaya bhava. Leading to: - Desire to challenge conventional boundaries of social positioning - Hunger to Possess unique identity through special entitlements. - Attracted to displays of physical glamour. Bhava 1: Native has an unusual individual identity. Craving to advance one's social position far beyond the rank into which one was born. A bit of a poseur, who may downplay one's common upbringing, attempting to appear more exotic. Often the mark of high performance in the area of life controlled by Rahu's lord, due to ambitious risk-taking. One is strangely attractive; and prone to take risks in one's life (usually in order to gain attention or power). - If Shani is associated with Rahu in lagna, these are calculated risks with scarce resources, reduced by conservative fears; - if Kuja is associated with Rahu in lagna, prone to adventure with physical risk; accidents; - if Chandra is associated with Rahu in lagna, prone to dramatic relationships with psycho-emotional risk - if Shukra is associated with Rahu in lagna, prone to glamour and attraction and creativity. In psychic terms: if Rahu + malefics, the birth personality is conflicted. The birth itself is challenged. Native must struggle to enforce their right to life. Native 'sneaks in' to the conception in a surreptitious act: stealing their drop of amrita. Rahu disrupts the customary methods of individual identity development."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 22All graha gain dignity in lagna, and Rahu is no exception. An extraordinary person who stands out from the crowd. Native is socially identified with foreign interests, the underclass, mysterious or taboo behaviors, or a threat to order implied in catastrophic social changes. The total results depend entirely on Rahu's lord and any grahas which co-occupy the lagna. The native is psychically hyper-sensitive to empowerments of all varieties. One seeks recognition and achievement, and is obsessively hungry for material-physical-sensual experience. Bhava 2:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of mental tasking and group communications: - Desire to penetrate the conventional boundaries protecting Stored Cultural Values and \"classic\" Knowledge Traditions. - Hunger to Possess histories, wealth collections, & classical languages - Attracted to banks, accounts, collections of valuable books, art, music, language materials, all hoards of knowledge and accumulated wealth. Rahu disrupts the customary methods of values acquisition. The native hungers for many types of knowledge, and is unable to maintain a sustained focus on a single type for long enough to build much wealth or expertise. Lifetime accumulations, including money savings, are erratic & unpredictable along a roller-coaster pattern. Periods of Rahu are fiercely acquisitive. If Rahu's lord is favorable, Rahu in domain-2 may signify great wealth - either in money or in knowledge, or both. Typically the native will desire to acquire not only money, but also a comprehensive knowledge of history -- especially knowledge of the traditions of one's blood lineage. One hungers to know languages, esp. the most valuable languages e.g. the ancient & sacred tongues. Rahu wishes to possess knowledge & material collections of art, music, jewels, money, & all beautiful and luxurious things (Shukra's house). However Rahu's rampant desires are not satisfied with a single collection. The more Rahu learns, the more Rahu acquires, the more He craves the experience of acquiring further foods, monies, jewels, art, music, books, and other containers of sustaining knowledge. One acquired, the materials lose their fascination, and Rahu's hunger moves to new, related values. The general range of collection types will be known according to Rahu's lord and Rahu's co-tenants. Rahu periods may produce dramatic taboo behaviors such as death, and bringing outsiders into the family. When Rahu occupies death house-2, and Rahu occupies an unfavorable angle from the mahadasha pati, Rahu periods can give powerful maraka effects including sudden deaths within the family."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 23Unusual or extreme expression of cultural values. Values are deeply influenced by foreign cultures and the native eats the foods of foreign lands. High permission to enjoy amplify the activities of the face & mouth. Attractive hair. High entitlement to eat & drink, speak & sing, as they please! Gives an intriguing, attractive, slightly exotic face. Bhava 3:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of mental tasking and group communications. - Desire to penetrate & disrupt the conventional integrity of Business Administration and Communication Patterns - Hunger to Possess the thoughts of others through special entitlements - Attracted to taboo conversations and interactive mental process. Challenges the conventional cultural styles of information management. Disrupts meetings, the information flow of work-group, team, or business department. A rather peculiar person to have in the office.Great hunger to talk with foreigners & take short trips to foreign lands. Can fabricate false stories for instrumental purposes, but is also a great short-story writer. Whether this mental attraction to extremes in storytelling is beneficial will depend on Rahu's lord. Too exotic mentally for success in parochial business, but may succeed in international commerce. Mental health:Disruption to the conventional flow of daily thoughts. Invades the boundaries of others' thoughts. The inner personal narrative may be surging with hungry desire for sensual experience. If Budha is involved with Rahu, the mental flow of daily thoughts and voices from past and present which rings in the heads of all humans, is a wild and exciting inner debate. Younger Siblings:The immediate younger sibling is odd or has strong foreign interests. Communication flow with the siblings is intense, peculiar, disrespectful of boundaries, challenging to personal integrity. If Rahu = yuti malefics, the sibling's mental health may be an issue. Bhava 4:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of cultural indoctrination.Associated with Land Reform movements and with patriotic cultural revolutions, \"the loyal opposition\". The native uses one's education toward taboo-challenging purposes Outsiders who are present in the childhood home create a peculiar & unstable or highly diverse upbringing, in which the natural repetition o familiar habits and customs is disrupted (e.g., foreign education) and child is not entirely secure. - Desire to challenge conventional boundaries of social security and cultural indoctrination - Desire to Possess cultural roots through special entitlements - Attracted to schools, lands & properties The native may receive indoctrination amongst the underclass or in an exotic, ritually proscribed land. Unusual process of basic socialization & cultural education. May reject conventional education, preferring to carve a taboo-challenging path toward one's own cultural identity.

Good for owning property in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 24foreign lands. Can accumulate a massive amount of property if Rahu's lord is powerful but one does not directly own it. Attracted to extremes in the world of real estate & education. Sudden changes of property ownership; damage to properties by natural catastrophe during Rahu periods. Bhava 5:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of expressing individual creativity. Can be an indication of celebrity, if Rahu's dispositor is favorable. - Desire to challenge conventional boundaries of expressing creativity, raising children, politics, speculation, and genius in performing arts - Hunger to Possess fame, celebrity, and recognition for individual intelligence - Attracted to amusements and games. Fascination with celebrity and political power. Excited by expressions of individual genius and by \"winning\". Expansive but unstable desire for children, which may be thwarted due to psychic fluctuations & inconsistency of purpose. Underclass or taboo attributes of the children. Rahu in a rashi of Budha or Shani may deny children. Rahu in other rashis may give large numbers of children. Only the house lord can determine whether the native can raise these unusual children, or whether the kids will be raised by others (servants, ex-spouses, etc.) Frequently an indicator of foreign adoption. Can signify adopting or raising one's grandchildren because one's own children have an irregular lifestyle. Bhava 6:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of performing service work and managing conflict.Generally when a malefic occupies a dusthana, the malefic oppresses the natural 'dus' (troubles) associated with the evil house, and the results are surprisingly good. The native's strongest desires are focused in the area of \"loss of agreement\", i.e. fighting, but one does not run from the challenge. Rather, a deep and sustained engagement often produces expertise and profit. - Desire to challenge conventional boundaries of social conflict: medicine, poverty, divorce, exploitation, and crime. - Hunger to Possess drugs & medicines, servants & animals, imbalanced and adversarial association. Attracted to underclass Rahu in domain-6 gives a \"mixed bag\".

There will be considerable illness from toxicity, often psycho-mental in origin, and danger from wrong drugs. In case of severe illness, the native may find remarkable cures from alternative treatments, or in a foreign land. There is allurement of unethical, disrespectful or forbidden activities.

Rahu disrupts the customary methods of marriage and business partnership. May have an exotic or taboo-breaking attitude toward sexual partnership. Foreign, exotic, or taboo-breaking attributes of the spouse. Marriage represents entitlement to satisfy a personal desire at the expense of social conformity. Spouse may be externally successful in worldly life, but the spouses boundary-breaking excesses or foreign behaviors are a permanent source of instability and challenge in the native's life. Spouse is inappropriate. Excellent for international business negotiations, where the spouse becomes a significant partnering asset. Also good for counseling/advising in multi-cultural and socially taboo relationships. Bhava 8:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of managing the joint assets of marriage, and gives a passion for handling sudden emergencies. Rahu is beneficial in domain-8, but only for magical or tantric healings, such as surgery, and emergency intervention.

Hunger for immersion in sudden movements of the cycle of birth & death, such as acute psycho-medical trauma, emergency first-responder, medical \"triage\", wills & estates, large-scale taxation, managing weapons of mass destruction, awareness of forces of great evil in the world. Bhava 9:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of religious ritual and wisdom teaching. High desire for intense experience in religious ritual and belief systems. Often has a foreign or outsider guru. The Guru may be involved in espionage or manipulation of foreign governments; or a cult priest; or other surreptitious taboo-breaking roles. The guru may be a renegade anti-traditionalist. Native tends toward extremes in ceremonial religion, with powerful desire to re-interpret or re-appropriate religious systems. Wants to make changes in the existing temples of knowledge & their priesthood. If Rahu is ill-disposed, may desecrate temples of knowledge. Bhava 10:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of leading organizations & managing public duties. There is a :"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 26- desire to challenge conventional boundaries protecting Leadership Respect & Prestige - hunger to possess respected positions, high reputation, important duties, government appointments - desire to attain executive offices, tops of pyramids, positions of power and command. To conventional observers, this person seems like an inappropriate or vulgar choice for an exalted public role. However if Rahu's lord is auspicious the public becomes fascinated with the native and one retains high dignity for a good long time. - Associated with sudden changes in leadership. - Wants status objects & admiration of the masses. - The native may profit from power vacuums & social instability. - An iconic agent of social change. Desires a high position in hierarchy, but has an exotic & taboo-challenging style of getting there. - Underclass, taboo-breaking, or exotic element in the public personality. \"Outsider\" breakthrough into iconic, symbolic public roles.

Normally, a karaka for wealth. Associated with pyramid schemes & questionable marketing practices. Great hunger for profitable association, which causes the native to form networks of association amongst highly diverse persons & interests. A chameleon of society, who enjoys manipulating the needs & desires of others for personal profit. Rahu in domain-11 is a karaka for marketplace success, and a high (though fluctuating) income. Rahu's lord must be auspicious to provide long-term sustained profits. Bhava 12:Rahu disrupts the customary methods of private enclosure and the handling imagery from the dream world. Desire to penetrate the conventional boundaries protecting Sanctuary, Loss of Identity, and Moksha. Hunger to possess dreams, images, and astral information. Attracted to foreign lands, private enclosures, meditation centers, monasteries, hospitals, and ashrams. One's private world of dreams & fantasies is forever churning & trying to merge with the imaginations of others, or invade the boundaries of others' private enclosures.

When Ketu is bad, he will cause to the native intense miseries; all his efforts will become fruitless; he will be doing only unprofitable things; there will also be loss of position; he will suffer from rheumatism, tuberculosis, shaking all over the body,' misunderstanding with the Brahmin folk. He will further commit the worst follies. Phaladeepika, Adhaya II, Sloka 34 : Ketu has a red and fierce look a venomous tongue, and an elevated body; he is armed; he is an outcast of a smoky colour, and is inhaling smoke always; he has bruised limbs; he is lean and is malicious Rahu & Ketu in Predictive Astrology, page 82, Manik Chand Jain: \"Rahu has the influence of Jupiter conjunction Venus. It gives intense appreciation and respect for the area by house where Rahu is located or transiting. There is popularity in this place with optimism and cheerfulness. This is a lucky place. .... Ketu has the influence of a Mars conjunct Saturn. In Ketu, too much of the Saturn accent can produce fear and hold the Mars action back. This can give poor timing. Mars represents energy and Saturn, a cycle of time. With the Combination, we need to take stock of the issues involved, and do something about them. There is an ambition for power where Ketu is located by house. The trick is to use the energy of Mars in the right amount by the disciplining of Saturn in an area of selfless service rather than over-possessiveness.\" Vedic Symbolism of Ketu – The South Nodes of the Moon Ketu, the descending or south lunar node, forms an integral part of the serpent, Vasuki. Ketu, along with Rahu, represent karmic retribution, linking the present restrictions and opportunities with past actions. In Vedic hymns, Ketu is invoked as “Decked with silk, flowers, garlands, sandal paste and an umbrella, of variegated colour and seated in a divine chariot which travels around mount Meru. Born of Jaimini’s family, under Abhijit star may four-armed, deathless, effulgent Ketu, seated facing south on a throne, make us ever happy with wealth and abundance.” The ancient seers gave Ketu such epithets as : Tamas, Dwaja and Sikkhin."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 29 Tamas; one of three basic attributes of nature, meaning darkness. This is associated with avarna shakti, the veil that conceals the real nature behind the manifestation. The illusory or Mayic covering gives us a wrong view of reality. It radiates a strange illumination born of its understanding of the illusory character of creation. The enigmatic splendour of Ketu arises from its understanding of human nature wrapped in the great illusion. Dwaja: means a flag or an emblem. It symbolises a) an eminent person; b) the organof generation c) a house situated in the east. The impulse makes an individual work under the orders given by a higher power. The person carrying the flag works under some authority; Ketu assists the externalization of the Divine Plan. As it is aware of the transient nature of existence, it does not involve itself in the physical or material realm. It functions from the mental plane and is induced towards spiritual unfoldment, which is the function of pure intelligence. Sikkhin: means an arrow, a horse, a bull, a lamp, a tree, a religious mendicant and a peacock. Sikkhin represents something pointed, well directed and serving as a funcrum. It signifies the sharp penetration of an arrow. The arrow is directed towards a target – the understanding of the process of Divine manifestation. With the dawn of such an understanding, Sikkhin apart from making the individual purely intellectual, orients a new life in the light of the new understanding, thereby enabling the person to work for the Divine Plan. Ketu, born under Abhijit refers to the bright northern star Vega, in Cpricorn, standing for the universalisation of the individual, in consonance with the planetary impulse of Ketu to carry out the Will of God. Ketu’s birth in Jaimini’s family under Abhijit stands for regenerative mental process under inner guidance that allow for the spiritual evolution of humanity. The emblem of Ketu is a downward curving semicircle linking two small circles place on either side above it. Both the small circles stand for the actualization of the individual’s destiny, the bottom of the semi circle symbolises the zenith, the incarnation of the soul’s growth to perfection is being realized, the several phases of development represented by the passage of the soul which the semicircular arc traverses. Ketu is spiritual humiliation. Ketu, who is associated with the arrow, looking from behind the veil of ignorance, taking orders from the Divine Intelligence, guides the destiny of the universe while preserving its cohesion and equilibrium. BENEFIC EFFECTS :of being separated from Head/Ego, Humility, Detachment. Physical: fasting, austerities, wandering, pilgrimage (esp. yuti Guru), high-permission sexuality / low barriers (esp. yuti Shukra), a strong Ketu is beneficial for the Practice of Medicine Psycho-emotional: easy detachment from ego, psychic intuition, subtle sensitivities strengthens \"tolerance for ambiguity\", a hallmark of moral maturity, authentic humility, increased awareness of subconscious projection.

When afflicted it signifies worries, suspicious nature of mind, hidden difficulties, unforeseen circumstances, impediments, insanity, amputation KETU AND THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AWARENESS At the higher levels of awareness, Ketu can aid concentration & meditation , create authentic, fully transformative sacrifice, support pure tantrik practices, establish complete non-reactive neutrality, invoke a conscious state of surrender – one’s only felt desire is the desire for deeper surrender, provide sincere & willing detachment from objects of desire, induce a state of passive, non-interfering and non-invested acceptance of reality, reduce “interference patterns” in perception increase the size, scope & clarity of the field of consciousness by eliminating desire-driven distractions, strengthen clairvoyant and clairaudient capabilities (again, reaping benefits of reduced interference). Benefits:If Ketu is well-situated, Ketu periods may bring all the benefits associated with the Ketu-occupied bhava. For example, Ketu in dhanasthana may bring extraordinary wealth – but the native will not be particularly attached to it! Ketu periods with their conscious rootlessness are very auspicious for guided austerity practices, withdrawal from non-spiritual relationships, sanctuary retreats, temple pilgrimage, sacred journey At medium levels of awareness:Ketu tends toward a mix of bitter disappointment & continuous yearning for connection:. Denial of ego nutrient, mental tension, caught in moral dilemmas and lose-lose options, lack of praise, denied promotions, loss of status, personal and professional setbacks due to failed expectations, Emotional withholding behaviors by Self and projected upon others, Frustration and blaming one’s shortcomings upon Other, Unconscious projection of childhood abandonment, fears into adult relationships, Bitter disappointments, Deep yearning for apparently unachievable goals, partners, and experiences, Contemptuous rejection of Other, cycling back to frustrated union, and rejection again, Unconscious or barely conscious projection of negative fantasies upon others Benefits:Ketu periods are exceptionally auspicious for personal psychotherapy, but may not yield much progress in relationship counseling. A focus on “abandonment” and “separation” issues will be fruitful. If Ketu is well-positioned and the native knows their true capabilities, there can be professional and personal advancement through careful management of power vacuums & unusual circumstances. Key to success is neutral humility paired with sensitive awareness of other's desires. (Not self-effacing or other false humility, but true neutrality and authentic skillful ability to serve other's interests, such as to help an organization reach its goals.) At lower levels of awareness: Ketu tends toward its more malefic state: Terror of abandonment, urgent but thwarted survival need to achieve union with the object of desire, leading to stalking, anxiety-driven predatory behaviors, etc Rejection of reality, Disregard for social and psychic boundaries, Fantasy-driven behaviors, falsifying credentials, posing and posturing, obsession with distant celebrity figures,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 32claiming that fantasy relationships are real, other confusions of the reality-imagination boundary, Native is exceptionally absorptive; other people’s negative projections easily find him, and stick to him, Deep neediness, relies on others to provide his/her identity, Inability to accept personal responsibility Victim state, Feels that homelessness, rootlessness, acts of desperation are the result of having been abandoned by those s/he once trusted, Asks for shelter from government, community, or family – but rejects services, fears & distrusts connection, needs to wander, Trapped in Ego reaction of toxic anxiety Divorce as a lower-level reactive fear bondage; Ketu is a karaka for divorce of the “I-give-up” type. However, true to the myth of Rahu-Ketu, divorce under Ketu means that the natives may physically separate from each other but they remain psychically connected in a perpetual cycle of victimization, blaming & distrust. Trauma:The brutal act of separation, abandonment, and rejection is described vividly in the myth of Rahu-Ketu. Ketu also indicates trauma. Look for trauma in the signification of Ketu's house and the character of His lord, as well as in any co-tenants who share a house with Ketu. Wherever the native shall suffer unbearable separations, with a great but unachievable longing for consummation or reunion, there is Ketu. Ketu is a karaka for ex-communication, divorce, being shunned, ostracized, or invalidated. Ketu's trauma is not likely to \"heal\" in the sense that material reunion will not be fully accomplished in this lifetime. However the emotional pain can be neutralized by deep acceptance and forgiveness. Each new Ketu bhukti will re-stimulate the core trauma of separation, rejection, abandonment, and loss of wholeness. Each Ketu bhukti offers and opportunity to practice neutrality and forgiveness. Positive management of Ketu's malefic effects: Ketu is a karaka for meditation and conscious awareness. All disabilities caused by Ketu can be improved through conscious awareness of the subconscious predisposition to expect disconnection, leading to a lifetime of disappointment & chronic mistrust. While Shri Ketu does have an essential lesson to teach regarding impermanence, it is not necessary for the native to suffer a lifetime of compulsive, subconsciously impelled rejection of connection and trust in matters of Ketu's domain. It is very difficult to manage Rahu's obsessive-compulsive desires. However, it is not so hard to manage Ketu. Luckily the reptile brain does not have to dominate human life. Conscious natives can learn to manage many historic, subconsciously driven compulsions -- even the most natural, largely bio-chemical, 'hard-wired' survival fears. Calm awareness of one's habitual rejection of completeness will go a long way toward resolving the malefic effects of Shri Ketu. The area of most dramatic rejection will be Ketu's birth domain (see table of Ketu in Houses, below). That same calm awareness can transform Shri Ketu's fearful effects into an overall positive spiritual experience of appreciation of impermanence. These two phenomena are really two sides of the same coin. The difference is that one is physically & emotionally terrifying and one is sweetly wise."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 33 Ketu gives the results of His lord and co-occupants :The most important thing to understand about the lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu is that they do not own any houses, and they do not own any signs. Rather, Rahu-Ketu function as magnifiers & distorters of the their bhava and rashi lords. Rahu-Ketu also amplify any co-tenant grahas within their house. Ketu contributes frustration and denial wherever he goes in the normal realms of life. Only at the highest levels of awareness is Ketu really an asset. However under good circumstances Ketu's power of disenchantment can also break the spell of material attractions, and show a direct route to enlightenment. Producing as He does the irresolvable conflict between Saturn/social law & order versus Mars/personal independence, Ketu induces a state of deep frustration and repressed anger which alienates the individual from the matters of the house which Ketu occupies. The native feels that, in matter's of Ketu's house and its lord, an irresistible force is trying to budge an immovable object. The result is traction and deep alienated frustration. Furthermore Ketu complicates the expression of his lord and co-occupying planets. Ketu and a strong Shukra, the native will have not only the excesses of wealth, beauty, prestige, and addiction that this Shukra would have brought independently. Ketu adds a surly, denying, frustrated to Shukra's effects which result in addiction to food, drugs, sex, and elegant company while plunging the individual into great denial about his true behavior. Ketu The Great Withholder :Ketu is Rahu's diametrically opposite force. Rahu is permissive and expansive like Venus and Jupiter, but Ketu is restrictive and like Shani and Mars. Whereas Rahu is passionate and desirous, Ketu is detached and withdrawn. The house, degree, sign, aspects, and other characteristics of Ketu show psychic imagery that has already been manifested by Rahu,. Under Ketu's influence the matter concerned is finished; we have stopped desiring and now wish to separate that matter from ourselves. Wherever Ketu is, there the person is detached, impassionate, stopped, and uninvolved with the development of those matters. Ketu is a manifestation of Shri Ganesha, the elephant-headed god who is the somber, plodding Remover of Obstacles.. Ketu is excellent for meditation and withdrawal from the world of the senses but understandably Ketu's influence damages any attempt at acquisitions. Ketu will \"destroy\" marriage in the 7th house because he doesn't really care enough to keep the fires of affection burning. Ketu gives a spouse but not affection toward the spouse; not passion. Ketu will make the person quite unconcerned about financial wealth when he occupies the 2nd or 11th houses. Financial affairs are blocked in some way, beyond personal control. That doesn't mean a person with Ketu in 2 or 11 will be poor. If the house lord is in good condition, that person with Ketu in 2 or 11 might have much money at his disposal. But he will not care about investing the money, and he will not have permission to change or control it. He will not take steps to protect money, develop his wealth, or show much attachment to it. Often this position is the spouse or child of a wealthy person, who has access to considerable funds but lacks passion for the wealth. Ironically, because Ketu's disengaged energy-state has no resistance to money, native with Ketu in a money position (2, 5, 9, 11) could be remarkably wealthy as a result of past-life"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 34labors. Much poverty is caused by resistance to wealth! However whether rich or poor, he will be neutral on the subject of acquiring and developing wealth. Like the native with Ketu in 7, s/he will accept the presence of a spouse as a social given - but express little truly personal interest in marital development Ketu, the Spiritual rejuvenator:Ketu shows where the native is the most bewildered & confused. Psychically, this is a weak patch in the aura, the protective energy shield of positive energy which surrounds each spirit in a body. Humans have much stronger, more complex, and \"brighter\" auras than other earthly forms. The more divine energy that is connected to & nourishing a human aura, the \"brighter\" the person looks psychically. They represent the \"bright\" qualities such as intelligence, charisma, enthusiasm, verve, good humor, etc. These qualities are \"seen\" (with the intuitive third eye) as \"bright\" patches in the aura. Ketu is in charge of the grey patches of foggy uncertainty, apathy, or confusion which show where the ego in this life is rather disinterested, yet for karmic reasons obliged to continue to connect by a thread. Grey is of course the colors of elephant, and Shri Ganesha is the elephant-headed god. Remover of obstacles, Ketu is like a bulldozer plowing away all unnecessary distractions from our spiritual path. That's why results of Ketu are generally \"bad\" materially ) but \"good\" spiritually. This role of Ketu is hampered by the karmic effects of a compromised Moon or when Ketu's planetary lord is inauspicious. The influences of Ketu's house & sign makes the native experience confusion, indecision, unclarity. The native remains, foggily and often passive-aggressively, engaged with it - often believing that someone else is causing the issue or that forces outside himself are at work. Ketu can be highly intuitive but in lower consciousness will tend toward superstition because the native passive-aggressively attributes his problems to the evil intentions, failures, or incompetence of others. As a manifestation of Shri Ganesha, Ketu gives remarkable benefits through disconnection and detachment, thereby cutting one's losses, abandoning hopeless projects, leaving unsuitable relationships, surrender before annihilation, etc. Ketu is associated with radically surgeries - a painful and invasive process which when successful can restore health and extend life. After the pain of loss subsides, one confirms this loss to have been a spiritual gain. TRANSIT OF KETU IN THE RADIX CHART The Lagna: Ketu transit of radix lagna, an 18-month period recurs once every 18 years. Ambiguity and/or spiritual acuity during which one disconnects from material attachments and accepts the separative, polarized nature of perceptions as an external phenomenon with no inherent reality. Ketu transit to lagna can be a component in divorce timing, loss of employment, forced house moves, loss of habitual environment, loss of identity-validation. Surya: The native's ego definition is a blank screen upon which the collective unconscious may project its needs and desires. Positive individual ego development is restrained by apathy & detachment, giving a reduced capacity for authentic faith in divine intelligence while sustaining social immaturity..

In civilized locations, this native must take care to observe social and ethical boundaries. Chandra: Native is emotionally numbed. The mother is emotionally disconnected, disenfranchised, timid, afraid of life, weakened by addiction or emotionally. The native may be unsure of one's emotional perceptions. Withdraws from parenting duties; lacks enthusiasm for family relationships and feels apathetic. Kuja: Physical body uncoordinated and less responsive. Nerves not as sharp; perception numbed. Less interested in physical experience. Reduction in vigor. Frustration & disappointment in one's own performance. Budha: Mental confusion, psychic sensitivity, great sensitivity to the mental patterns of others in one's environment. Psychic absorptiveness, may feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of intuitive information that the native is receiving. Tendency to believe in religious dogmas and ideological tenets without too close inspection of the logical implications of those beliefs. Guru: Optimism and generosity are distorted. Vague ideas about cosmic interconnectedness & righteous action may replace practice of meditation & rituals of true religion. Ideology can replace faith. Tendency toward cult beliefs and idolatry of guru. May also give frustration & confusion about which faith is valid, inability to locate the sangha, feeling lost and disconnected from the divine. Shukra: Deeply confused about sensual pleasures and love relationships. Difficulty placement for a male, because it confuses and deranges the perception of the wife and women in general. Difficult for females, due to confusion and uncertainty of one's own feminine beauty and entitlement to sensual pleasures. Trouble finding the right balance point in all matters of harmonious arrangement and good design. Artists will struggle to find a good expression; those who make beautiful things may have a weird, out of balance phase of producing odd art. Does not struggle against addictions. Shani: Separateness and confusion about definition and scope of social duties. Non-conformist tendencies. Feels oppressed by customary procedures and social expectations yet is disinclined to try something new. Tends to stick with the tried and true yet feels restless, undefined, marginalized. KETU IN THE TWELVE RASHIS In rashi, Rahu-Ketu's primarily give the effects of their rashi lords, & of any co-tenant planets which share their house. Mesha (Aries): Ketu will blunt the sensitivities of Mangala, making the native less warlike & more self-preoccupied, less clear about their external military goals & more concerned with their internal warfare. One competes against standards for achievement it is true but these will tend to be spiritual standards which have little material value and the warrior energies are unlikely to achieve much unique self-definition in external social life.

Good for winning inner battles against addiction or fears; for un-conflicted dedication to an organization or ideal. Vrishaba (Taurus): Depends absolutely on how Lord Shukra functions in the overall nativity. Ketu in Vrishabha rashi will blunt the sensitivities of Venus, making the native unsure about sensual indulgence. This native can lose himself easily in escapist behaviors of sensual and sexual pleasure. If Shukra is strong, then drugs, alcohol, fine fabrics, lovely appearances, delicious foods & scented oils will find this native easily. However, no amount of pleasure will be satisfying to this person. The body's cravings are never fulfilled; desires only increase, without satisfaction. This native seeks deepest fulfillment through marriage & love relationships but that area of life is precisely where he is most disenchanted. His love behavior will be seen by outsiders as \"passive-aggressive\" because the native simultaneously wants sensual love & pleasure, while rejecting it. Ketu in Vrishabha either self-destructs through sensual addictions or develops a very selective sensual filter, allowing the native to pursue only those pleasures which advance specific spiritual goals. Mithuna (Gemini): Depends absolutely on how Lord Budha functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blur the mental-communicative sensitivities of Mercury, making the native dissatisfied with mundane communications and likely to twist, evade, mystify, or ignore communicative convention. The native relies on a few phrases or devices, and does not make the effort to articulate his speech or gestures. When Ketu is yuti Budha in swakshetra, the native's verbal and written communication is difficult to understand even whilst he may be multi-lingual or work in a media job! Often exaggerated speed or a speech defect will be the culprit. Karaka (Cancer):Depends absolutely on how Lord Chandra functions in the overall nativity. This is more true of the Moon than any other planet. Ketu will blunt the sensitivities of Moon, making the native emotionally detached and impersonal in their nurturing style. Frequently the mother or primary nurturer rejects the native either overtly or covertly. The native is perpetually dissatisfied with their home conditions, and may be afraid of water. Simha (Leo): Depends absolutely on how Lord Surya functions in the overall nativity. When occupying Simha rashi, Ketu will blunt the ethical sensitivities of Sun, making the native ambivalent about creative ego-expression in general and about assuming moral authority in particular. Consistent with Ketu's passive-aggressive style, this native is prone to criticizing the leadership positions of others and trying to undermine ethical claims, rather than making positive suggestions toward constructive ways of channeling Divine intelligence.

Moral uncertainty surrounds but does not unsettle them. Ketu with Surya in swakshetra may yield a creative genius who expresses unworldly sounds and color. Past-lives associated with cult of the Sun-priest; they have been sacrificed & although they love the celebrity they are naturally wary of abuse of power. Kanya (Virgo): Depends absolutely on how Lord Budha functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the mental-organizational sensitivities of Mercury, making the native a curator & collector of concepts & ideas which lack direction & serve little practical purpose. May pursue dead-end analytical philosophy, or elaborately documented yet unfounded conspiracy theories. Mistakenly they substitute a vast collection of details for an actual system, i.e., they miss the forest for the trees at least intellectually. Verbally inconsistent but insight is profound. Spiritually the information is good & liberating. One follows circuitous analytical paths, mentalizing when they should be meditating & meditating when they should be mentalizing, always frustrated & dissatisfied with the value & purpose of their knowledge base.mentalizing, always frustrated & dissatisfied with the value & purpose of their knowledge base. Thula (Libra): Depends absolutely on how Lord Shukra functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the artistic & architectural sensitivities of Venus, making the native ambivalent about balance & design, and thwarting his relationship management skills. His sense of natural balance, fairness, and justice in the larger sense being lost in a fog, the native is likely to err in judgment on social & personal matters. One is disliked, considered unaesthetic, badly dressed, or somehow an icon of poor taste in one's society. In situations where polite negotiation of meaning or identity is required, one lacks the grace to introduce oneself properly or make the other party feel balanced in one's company. Ketu with Shukra/swakshetra may produce a genius of unorthodox costume design, or an avant-garde style in arts or theatre. Vrischika (scorpio): Depends absolutely on how Lord Mangala functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the sensitivities of Mars, making the native ambivalent about tantric healing, profound therapeutic change, and the reality of trauma. He spends much of his life force in the project of denying the existence of psycho-spiritual energies; he disregards magic; and he avoids therapeutic engagement in conscious change. Ketu yuti swakshetra Mangala could under favorable circumstances produce a tantrika of great ability. Such a person under proper guidance might become an effective channel for planetary healing although working from the dark side. Dhanus (Sagittarius): Depends absolutely on how Lord Brihaspati functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the sensitivities of Jupiter, making the native ambivalent about the reality of fundamental goodness, world family, All-One, and other blessings of the Divine which penetrate the veil of our human sadness and bring spiritual light into human lives. This native is curmudgeonly, unable to recognize the value of education, religion, or charity. He tends toward atheism and survival-of-the-fittest market economics. He dislikes group activities and does not celebrate holidays.

It may be clarifying to be free of idealistic, ideological attachment when constructing comprehensive world visions. Makar (Capricorn): Depends absolutely on how Lord Shani functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the hierarchical, caste sensitivities of Saturn, making the native taciturn without benefit of realism, and expecting protection from the hierarchy without knowledge of or commitment to their position in that hierarchy. In general Ketu is problematic in Shani's signs where groundedness & practical good sense are important for basic survival on the material plane. Good position for truly religious political leaders or the wandering mendicant who takes physical sustenance from temples & government rationing programs. Kumbha (Aquarius): Depends absolutely on how Lord Shani functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the populist, democratizing sensitivities of Saturn, making the native ambivalent about his role in the marketplace. Kumbha is in general a highly abstract sign, famous for its esoteric theories and special interest groups which have little connection to the survival reality of the global population yet purport to be universal in nature. Kumbha is the solar or rational side of Shani's domain, concerned primarily with equalizing exchange networks of the marketplace not with the emotional security of fixed caste (Makara). Ketu here gives reluctance to participate in networks of association and dislike of the masses. Ketu with swakshetra Shani is likely to produce extreme disengagement from earthly politics and distrust of human social movements, marginalizing the native and forcing the group-think scope into galactic or even cosmic range This is a science-fiction orientation with a mind that wanders across the universe in search of a culture weird enough and 'safe' enough but also familiar enough to identity with. Might be a gifted sci-fi script writer or mathematician or computer programmer if Budha is strong. Otherwise, seeks anonymity and intellectual distance through cold logic. Could live in isolation & socialize exclusively via computer networks. Very detached person. Meena (Pisces): Depends absolutely on how Lord Brihaspati functions in the overall nativity. Ketu will blunt the sensitivities of Jupiter, making the native ambivalent about the world of private imagery, traveling in the spirit world, and one's natural communion with all sentient beings. May be intensely intuitive, aware of the presence of fairies, elves, devas, deities, & spirit beings of many classes. Dispassionately observes the sorrows of the wandering. Accepts wandering, accepts a disconnected, dreamlike state; accepts the vast cosmic viewpoint. This native is lonely and worried about their well-being; naturally withdrawn. One avoids formal or actively engaged meditation and sanctuaries such as ashrams and monasteries, although ironically in a state of extreme detached awareness of the interconnectedness of all life, they are exemplary models of meditative neutrality.

Ketu is the planet of disconnection & vyayasthana is the house of disconnection, so despite initial restlessness, the native settles into enthusiastic \"giving away\" of all attachments - which weren't going to last anyway. Malefic graha in dusthana give good results. One is disconnected from his inner sanctuary but he becomes available for helping those most deeply in need. There is always an increasing alignment with the Divine cycle of manifestation & dissolution, breathing in & breathing out. As always with Rahu-Ketu the planetary lord defines Ketu's effect. If the lord is a strong benefic there can be great waste seeking after bed pleasures. More sensible approach to loss if the lord is a neutral or malefic. However even this resolves with time. Will wander aimlessly, disregarding offers of sanctuary. Will also \"hop fences\" and cross barriers as one has little regard for separations or boundaries, personal, ethical, ethnic, religious, legal, or material. Thinks of spiritual life as real and true and material accumulation is not the aim of life. Therefore, gradually through life, you spend more of your time & energy towards serving good causes. One does well because of their sincere approach to life. A natural malefic in a dusthana generally gives quite good results.

XVIII OTHER GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANETS Strong Planets:A strong natal planet protects and promotes its general significations and the significations of its mooltrikona house. Any planet is considered strong when it is not in the state of weakness. It can increase its strength if: "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 50a) it is young, i.e. its longitude is between 10º to 20º in a particular sign. b) it occupies own or good navamsa and other divisions. c) it is under the close influence of the functional benefic planets. d) it occupies its exaltation, mooltrikona or own sign. Weak Planets:A weak natal planet is not capable of fully protecting/promoting its general significations and the significations of its mooltrikona house during the course of its sub-periods and during the triple transit functional malefic influences. By descending order of weakness, any planet becomes weak when: 1) The most effective point of its mooltrikona sign is afflicted by a functional malefic planet within an orb of one degree. 2) The most effective point of its house of placement is afflicted by a functional malefic planet within an orb of one degree. 3) It is conjunct or aspected by any functional malefic planet within an orb of one degree. 4) It is combust due to its nearness to the Sun. 5) It occupies malefic houses from the ascendant, except if in its own mooltrikona sign. 6) It occupies its sign of debilitation. 7) It is in the state of infancy or old-age. 8) It occupies its debilitated sign in navamsa. 9) It occupies the mooltrikona sign of a weak planet. 10) It is the Moon within 72 degrees either side of the Sun. However, this is a minor weakness. NOTE: In serial nos. (1) to (3) above, when the affliction is special or multiple i.e. when it comes from: 1) a conjunction with/ aspect from the most malefic planet, 2) an aspect from a functional malefic planet placed in a dusthana, 3) a conjunction with Rahu or Ketu (Rahu-Ketu axis) 4) an aspect of a functional malefic planet afflicted by other(s) functional malefic planet, 5) more than one functional malefic planet at the same time, Then the otherwise \"strong\" planet should be considered afflicted (and weak) even when the orb of affliction is of two degrees. Afflicted Planets:Whenever a planet is already weak for any other reason and is under the close influence of any functional malefic, it is treated as an afflicted planet. But when the planet is not weak for other reasons, it can only be considered afflicted under the exact influence of any functional malefic, becoming a weak planet for that reason. So whenever any planet is afflicted, it becomes weak. The significations of the house having a mooltrikona sign of an afflicted planet are harmed. Afflicting Planets:Only the functional malefic planets can be afflicting planets. It is very necessary to understand the difference between afflicting planets and afflicted planets. Dispositor:Dispositor is a planet in whose moolatrikona sign another planet is located in the natal chart.

Jupiter is of satvic. Mars, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu are of tamsic nature. The Sun, Mars, and Jupiter are male while the Moon, Venus, and Rahu are female. Mercury, Saturn and Ketu are eunuchs. FUNCTIONAL NATURE OF PLANETS The functional nature of planets is the key analytical factor in the horoscope analysis. Besides Rahu and Ketu, the planets, whose mooltrikona signs are in malefic houses (sixth, eighth and twelfth) with reference to the ascendant, act as functional malefic planets in a nativity. For this purpose, under the Systems' Approach, the sign Cancer is considered as the mooltrikona sign of the Moon. FUNCTIONAL MALEFIC PLANETS The functional malefic planets for various ascending signs are as under: Aries: Mercury, Rahu and Ketu. Taurus: Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Rahu and Ketu. Gemini: Rahu and Ketu.

It is described in chapter 27 of Hora Shastra. Shadbala consists of 6 different sources of strength. Each source represents an aspect of strength, such as planetary placement in zodiacal signs or aspectual strength. Signification Planetary strength is important for chart prediction. Strong planets will have auspicious effects during their time of influence (Dasas, transits). Weak planets will have inauspicious effects. Strength of Rasi resp. Bhava lords is another important aspect of the chart. Bhavas will have effects according to their strength and the strength of their lords. Some sources of strength give hints for special purposes: e.g. Digbala gives informations about directions having positive or negative effects. Calculation The complete Shadbala is the sum of all Balas. Balas are calculated in Rupas or Virupas. One Rupa has 60 Virupas. Most sources of strength have values between 0 Virupas (very weak) and maximum value of 60 Virupas (very strong). Other sources (like Drekkana Bala) have only a maximum value of 30 Virupas. Parasara gives required values of strength for each planet. Planets meeting these requirements are considered to be strong. These planets will have favourable effects. Planets without strength will prove inauspicious. TYPES OF SHADBALA There are 6 main types of Shadbala. Sthana Bala and Kala Bala have several sub-Balas. The hierarchy (including translation of Sanskrit terms) is shown below. Please follow the links.  1. Sthana Bala - positional strength  1.1 Saptavargaja Bala - strength of exaltation  1.2 Uchcha Bala - divisional strength  1.3 Ojhajugmariamsa Bala - strength related to placement in odd/even Rasis and Navamsas  1.4 Kendradi Bala - strength of placement in angle, succedent or cadent houses"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 53 1.5 Drekkana Bala - strength according to Drekkana placement of planets  2. Dig Bala - directional strength  3. Kala Bala - temporal strength  3.1 Nathonatha Bala - diurnal/nocturnal strength  3.2 Paksha Bala - strength related to Lunar phase  3.3 Tribhaga Bala - strength related to portions of the day/night  3.4 Varsha-Masa-Dina-Hora Bala - strength of astrological year, month, day and hour  3.5 Yudhdha Bala - strength caused by planetary war  3.6 Ayana Bala - equinoctial strength  4. Cheshta Bala - motional strength  5. Naisargika Bala - natural strength  6. Drig Bala - aspectual strength Shad Bala – Sthana Bala Sthana Bala is the strength of planetary positions. This kind of strength depends exclusively on the zodiacal positions of the planets. Other factors (like speed, Bhava cusps or aspects) are neglected in this context. There are 5 parts of Sthana Bala. The total Sthana Bala is the sum of these 5 parts. No. Sthana Bala Type Description 1 Uchcha Bala Strength of exaltation 2 Saptavargaja Bala Divisional strength 3 Ojhajugmariamsa Bala Placement in odd/even Rasis and Navamsas 4 Kendradi Bala Placement in Kendra, succedent or cadent houses 5 Drekkana Bala Drekkana placement of planets 1. UCHCHA BALA Uchcha Bala is a measure for the distance between a planet and its exaltation point. Each planet gets 1 Rupa in exaltation and zero in debilation. Other positions contribute a proportional value. Rule: Find out the distance between a planet an its debilation point (max is 180). Uchcha Bala (in Virupas) will be one third of this value. Uchcha Bala Example Let the Sun be in 12 Gemini. Debilation is in 10 Libra. Distance between both points is 118 deg. So Uchcha Bala will be 118/3 = 39.3 Virupas. 2. SAPTAVARGAJA BALA"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 54Saptavargaja Bala is the divisional strength of seven Vargas (Saptavargas). Saptavargaja Bala is similar to Saptavarga calculation, but the evaluation is different, and there is no weigthed evaluation, i.e. all Vargas have the same contribution. The seven Vargas are  Rasi (D-1)  Navamsa (D-9)  Hora (D-2)  Decanate (D-3)  Saptamamsa (D-7)  Dvadasamsa (D-12)  Trimsamsa (D-30) Each Varga placement contributes a strength according to the placement in the planet's sign. Placement  Strength  (Virupas)  Moolatrikona 45 Onw Rasi 30 Extreme friend (Adhi Mitra) 20 Friend (Mitra) 15 Neutral (Sama) 10 Enemy (Satru) 4 Extreme Enemy (Adhi Satru) 2 Theoretical maximum value for Saptavargaja Bala is 45*7=315 Virupas (Planet in Moolatrikona for all Vargas). To note: 1. Strength calculation is not the same as in Saptavarga calculation. 2. Exaltation and debilation play no role in Saptavargaja Bala. 3. Moolatrikona placement in Varga charts is calculated according to sign position not to length (because there is no length in higher Varga charts). There are different opinions about temporary friendship of planets. Some say that temporary friendship is always relative to Rasi placement of planets, others say that this friendship must be calculated from the underlying Varga chart 3. OJHAJUGMARIAMSA BALA Ojhajugmariamsa Bala is about the placement of the planets odd/even Rasis and Navamsas. Female planets (Moon, Venus) get 15 Virupas if they are placed in in even Rasi/Navamsa, zero otherwise."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 55Male planets (Sun, Mars, Jupiter) and neutral planets (Mercury, Saturn) get 15 Virupas if they are placed in in odd Rasi/Navamsa, zero otherwise. This calculation must be made for Rasi an Navamsa chart separately, i.e. a planet can get a maximum of 30 Virupas for this kind of strength. Ojhajugmariamsa Bala Example Moon in 1 Pisces gets 15 Virupas for Rasi placement in odd sign and 15 Virupas for placement in female Navamsa (Cancer). The total Ojhajugmariamsa Bala is therefore 30 Virupas. 4. KENDRADI BALA Kendradi Bala evaluates the fact that planets in angles (Kendras) are stronger than planets in succedent or cadent houses. Each planet in angle gets full strength (60 Virupas), planets in succedent houses get 50% of strength (30 Virupas), while planets in cadent houses only get 25% (15 Virupas). There is no distinction between male and female planets etc. in this Bala type. The table below shows the Kendradi Bala for all houses. . 4.

DREKKANA BALA Drekkana Bala is based upon placement of planets in decanates of Rasis. Male planets get 15 Virupas in first decanate, female planets in 2nd decanate, neutral planets in 3rd decanate. This evalution is valid for all zodiacal signs; there is no distinction between male and female signs. The table below shows the Drekkana Bala for Rasi positions. The degrees are the Rasi portions of the planets' lengths (e.g. Mars in 15° Leo will have Drekkana portion of 15° in the table)."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 56Planets/Degrees 0° - 10° 10° - 20° 20°- 30° Sun, Mars, Jupiter 15 0 0 Moon, Venus 0 15 0 Mercury, Saturn 0 0 15 Dig Bala Dig Bala is the strength of planetary directions, i.e. their position relative to the angles of the chart. Signification:Digbala has high influence on the effects of the planets: 1. Planets with high Digbala will have auspicious effects in the direction of their strength. 2. Planets with bad Digbala will cause losses and difficulties in their direction of strength or the opposite direction. Remark: It is difficult to determine the correct direction in which events will take place because there are different views of planetary directions. Digbala is the source of strength but events may take place in the directions attributed to the planets, i.e.  Sun: east  Saturn: west  Mercury: north  Mars: south  Jupiter: north-east  Rahu: south-west  Moon: north-west  Venus: north-east Calculation Each planet has directional strength in an angle of the chart. These points of strength are: the cusp of 1st house (Ascandant), 7th house (Descendant), 4th house (Nadir, Imum Coeli) or 10th house (Meridian, Medium Coeli). Sun and Mars are strong in the 10th, Jupiter and Mercury in the Ascendant, Moon and Venus in the 4th and Saturn in the 7th. Dig Bala of a planet is the distance between his position and the corresponding point of mimimum strength (in Virupas). Values greater than 180° or 60 Virupas must be deducted from 360° resp. 120 Virupas, so the Dig Bala of a planet must be between zero and 60 Virupas.

PAKSHA BALA"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 58Paksha Bala is related to Lunar phase at the time of birth. Benefics get high Pakasha Bala near Full Moon, low Bala near New Moon. Reverse for malefics. Calculation Paksha Bala in Virupas depends on the angle between Moon and Sun. The formula is pakshabala = ( moon - sun ) / 3 The Bala must be deducted from 120 if the value exceeds 60. This method yields a small value if birth takes place near New Moon (irrespective of placement before/after New Moon). Birth near Full Moon will result in high Paksha Bala (~60). Birth near Half Moon will have 30 Virupas. This method is extended to all planets in Paksha Bala. Benefic planets (Jupiter, Venus) get Paksha Bala Virupas according to this method. The method of calculation is reverse for malefics (Sun, Mars, Saturn) i. e. the value must be deducted from 60. The Moon is benefic if birth takes place in the bright half of the month, i.e. birth is between New Moon and Full Moon. Reversely Moon is malefic for birth in the dark half of the month (between Full Moon and New Moon). Mercury is regarded as malefic if conjunct with a malefic, benefic otherwise. 3. TRIBHAGA BALA Tribhaga Bala is about portions of the day/night at the time of birth. Each portion of the day resp. night has a lord as its ruler. The lord of the birth time will get full strength (60 Virupas). See table. Day/Night Part Lord Day 1 Mercury Day 2 Sun Day 3 Saturn Night 1 Moon Night 2 Venus Night 3 Mars Jupiter always gets 60 Virupas, i.e. each chart will have two planets with 60 Virupas Tribhaga Bala: the lord of birth time and Jupiter.

YUDHDHA BALA Yudhdha Bala is about planetary war. Planetary war takes place if 2 planets (Mars ... Saturn) are within one degree of each other. Shad Bala – Ayana Bala: Ayana Bala plays a singular role in Shadbala calculation. Some see it as a part of Kala Bala, others see Ayana Bala as a separate source of strength. Ayana Bala is identical to Cheshta Bala for the Sun (the Sun has no own Cheshta Bala because he is always in Sama motion). Signification Ayana Bala depends upon declination and the tropical zodiac, i.e. Ayanamsa must be neglected. Ayana Bala is the only source for evaluation of this planetary property. Moon and Saturn are strong with southern declination; Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus in the north. Mercury plays a special role in so far as it is strong with northern as well as southern declination. So Mercury is again the most neutral planet. All planets (including Mercury) have medium Ayana Bala near the equinoxes. Calculation Ayana Bala depends upon the declination of the planets resp. their tropical length (which is nearly the same, see below). It is important to remember that Ayanamsa must be added to the planetary lengths in Ayana Bala calculation. The planets form 3 groups, each of them having their own rules for Ayana Bala calculation. All planets have 50% Ayana Bala strength (30 Virupas) in the equinoxes (0 Aries and 0 Libra). The specific rules are 1. The Moon and Saturn have maximum Ayana Bala (60 Virupas) near the point 0 Capricorn, zero in 0 Cancer."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 602. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus have maximum Ayana Bala near the point 0 Cancer, zero in 0 Capricorn. 3. Mercury has maximum Ayana Bala near 0 Cancer and 0 Capricorn. KRANTI BASED CALCULATION Kranti is the declination of a planet relative to the celestial equator. A planet in the equinox has Kranti zero while a planet near the point 0 Capricorn or 0 Cancer has maximum Kranti (which is about 23:27 deg). The rule for Ayana Bala calculation is ayanabala = 30 * ( eps +- kranti ) / eps = 1.2793 * (eps +- kranti) where eps is the obliquity of the ecliptic (23:27). The rules for addition/subtraction of the Kranti value are  Moon and Saturn: the value must be added for southern Kranti, deducted for northern Kranti.  Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus: the value must be added for northern Kranti, deducted for southern Kranti.  Mercury: the value must be added for northern and southern Kranti. PARASARA'S METHOD The second method is described by Parasara in chapter 27 (15-17) of Hora Shastra. Find out the tropical length of a planet i.e. add Ayanamsa to its length. Calculate the distance from the nearest equinoxe. This value must be between 0 and 90. There are 3 Khandas (portions) for 3 possible Rasis: 45 (1st sign), 33 (2nd sign) and 12 (3rd sign). Khanda Rules 1.) Planets within the 1st sign get the proportional strength according to their length in that sign (Khanda 45). Example: A planet in 10° Pisces has distance 20° from equinoxe (0° Aries) and will get a value of 20/30 * 45 = 30. 2.) Planets in the 2nd sign (30°-60°) will get the Khanda of 45 plus proportional value (of 33) for their length in the 2nd sign. Example: a planet in 10° Scorpio has distance of 40° from equinoxe. So the value is 45+ 10/30 * 33 = 56. 3.) Planets in the 3rd sign (60° - 90°) get a value of 78 (=45+33) plus the portion of the Khanda value (12)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 61Example: a planet in 15° Cancer has distance 75° from equinoxe. The total value will be 78 + 15/30 * 12 = 84. The result must be between 0-90. Planets near the equinoxes get a small value (near 0); planets near 0°Cancer or 0°Capricorn get a high value (near 90). Rules for Specific Planets Moon and Saturn get in addition 90 degrees if they are posited between Libra and Pisces. The value must be deducted from 90 if their position is between Aries and Virgo. Same vice versa for Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus i.e. 90 must be added for for positions between Aries and Virgo; the value must be deducted from 90 for Libra to Pisces. For Mercury 90 must always be added. The result must be divided by 3 to get Ayana Bala in Virupas. The value must be between 0 and 60 Virupas. LENGTH BASED CALCULATION This method doesn't use the declination of the planets but is only based upon their tropical length. The results are almost identical to the above described method's results. The calculation rule is ayanabala = 30 * ( 1 +- abs( sin( len ) ) ) where len is the tropical length of the correponding planet/luminary. The rules for addition/subtraction are the same as above. Example Take May 1st 1990 0:00 UT as example. Length must be Sayana (without Ayanamsa); declination must be relative to the equator (not to the ecliptic). The table shows that the results are quite similar; the tolerance is within 2 Virupas.

This kind of strength applies only to the planets, not to the luminaries. The Cheshta Bala of the Sun is identical to his Ayana Bala; Cheshta Bala of the Moon is her Paksha Bala. The five planets (Mars ... Saturn) may have 8 different types of motion. They can be in direct motion (slow, normal or accelerated), be stationary or retrograde. Another kind of motion is the introgression into the next/previous sign of the zodiac in accelerated of retrograde motion. RETROGRADE MOTION Retrograde Planets are very strong according to Cheshta Bala. A retrograde planet is powerfull and gets the full Cheshta Bala (i.e. 60 Virupas). This kind of motion is called Vakra. Another kind of retrograde motion is Anuvakra. A planet is in Anuvakra motion if he is retrograde and enters the previous sign in his retrograde motion. Anuvakra planets get 50% of strength (30 Virupas). Stationary Planets A planet is stationary if he he is devoid of motion. This happens if the motion is changing from direct to retrograde or vice versa. Stationary planets get a strength of 25% i.e. 15 Virupas. This kind of motion is called Vikala. Direct Motion There are 5 different kinds of direct motion described in Hora Shastra. The motion is called Mandatara if the speed is slow. Mandatara motion gets 25% of strength (15 Virupas). The motion is called Manda if the speed is medium. Manda motion gets 50% of strength (30 Virupas). Normal motion is called Sama. A planet is in Sama motion if his speed is near the average. Sama motion gets 7.5 Virupas and is the weakest of all motions. Fast direct motion is called Chara. Chara planets get 75% of strength (45 Virupas). A special Chara motion is Atichara. A planet is in Atichara motion if he is in Chara and enters the next sign of the zodiac. Atichara planets get 50% of strength (30 Virupas).

This strength does not depend on the specific chart but is fixed for all charts. SignificationPlanets with nearly identical Shadbala can be evaluated by their Naisargika Bala, i.e. the planet with higher Naisargika Bala can be regarded as stronger. Calculation The seven bodies are ordered by their luminosity and get relative strength according to their position in that order. Sun has the highest luminosity, Saturn is the darkest planet; other planets get portions of 1/7 Rupa according to their position in that order.

The net strength is important for the judgement of the effects during Dasas and transits. Planets with high net Bala will have strong effects. These effects will be auspisious in most cases. But strong planets can also have strong inauspisious effects, especially Saturn and Mars. Planets with low net Bala will prove inauspicious or harmless. Shadbala Requirements Strength and weakness of planets depend upon their total Shadbala. Planets are considered to be strong if they meet the minimum Shadbala requirements mentioned in Hora Shastra. The values are Planet Required (Rupas) Virupas Sun  6.5  390"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 64Moon 6.0 360 Mars 5.0 300 Mercury 7.0 420 Jupiter 6.5 390 Venus 5.5 330 Saturn 5 300 A planet that has at least the required Shadbala Pinda is considered to be strong and will show favourable results. Nevertheless malefics like Saturn or Mars can give problems and miseries, too. Requirements for Individual Shadbala Types There is another Shadbala requirement template that is based upon individual requirements for different types of Sub-Balas. This approach can be used as an alternative method for judgement of strength, even if the requirements mentioned above do not match. Planets are arranged in groups. The corresponding planet must match all the requirements in order to be considered as strong. The table shows the required Balas in Virupas.

USE OF SHADBALA The individual elements of the shadbala show different aspects in our life. They are as follows: 1. Sthana Bala: This planet is the giver of position and status. This also shows which positions are most auspicious for us and where shall we be most comfortable. 2. Dig Bala: This shows the direction which shall be good for us for growth in the career or self development. 3. Kaala Bala: This shows which time is best suitable for us for undertaking an activity. 4. Cheshta Bala: This shows what drives us, our inherent desires and purpose of our struggle in this life. 5. Naisargika Bala: This is of lesser consquence as this remains constant all through out. This is to be used in conjunction with other strengths. This indicate which planets are naturally more able to dictate their results. 6. Drik Bala: This shows which planet shall be favourable all through out in the life of native as this is based on the aspect of benefics on the planet. Shadbalas or Six Fold strength: The planets acquire strength from six (6) sources, called Shadbalas, by virtue of occupation in the horoscope. They are: "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 651. Positional or Sthanabala:- A planet gets strength by virtue of its position in a rasi which happens to be the planet's exaltation, own, moolatrikona (trine) friendly or Swavarga (own six fold division) in the Shadvargas. 2. Digbala (Directional Strength): -Jupiter and Mercury are powerful and strong in East. -Sun and Mars are powerful and strong in North. -Saturn is powerful and strong in the West. -Venus and Moon are strong and powerful in the South. 3. Motional Strength (chestabala): This is by virtue of the position of planets in their Northern and Southern course. The association of planets also afford motional strength. Six (6) signs constitute Uttarayana or Northerly course of Sun: -Capricorn -Aquarius -Pisces -Aries -Taurus -Gemini The Sun and Moon are strong in these signs by virtue of motional strength. Retrograde Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn will have motional strength. These planets in conjunction with the full Moon are strong. Jupiter, Venus, Mercury and Saturn in conjunction with Mars get Motional strength; when they occupy the succeeding constellation to that occupied by Mars. 4. Temporal strength: (KALABALA): Planets get strength and power by virtue of the time of birth. For a person born during the night time, the Moon, Mars and Saturn are powerful. So they are planets of nocturnal strength. The planets having diurnal strength are the Sun, Jupiter and Venus. Hence persons born during the day time derive strength from these diurnal planets. Mercury is both diurnal and nocturnal and is always powerful, whether at day or night time. Malefics i.e. Sun, Mars, Saturn are powerful during the dark half or Krishna Paksha; while benefics i.e. Moon, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are powerful during the bright half or Sukla Paksha.

Aspect strength or drugbala: . Drugbala or 'aspect strength' is the result of the aspects of planets. A house or a planet in a house which is aspected by another planet gets or lose its strength. The aspect of a benefic planet enhances strength of the aspected planet or house while a malefic reduces strength. All planets aspect the 7th house. These special aspects are more powerful than the 7th house aspect: Saturn aspects 3rd and 10th houses Jupiter aspects 5th and 9th houses Mars aspects 4th and 8th houses 6. Naisargikabala or Natural strength: Planets have certain natural strength, irrespective of position. In the order of strengths, the planets can be arranged as: Sun, Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars and Saturn. Strength is measured in rupas or 'intensities'. They are: Sun 30 Moon 16 Venus 12 Jupiter 10 Mercury 8 Mars 6 Saturn 1 Over-lapping or Ascendant or over Lording Full Moon. Saturn, Ketu and Jupiter over lap, over lord certain houses from their location. This is called Aschadana. The effect of the over lording planet on the over lorded house and planet also should be taken into consideration. It is almost like the aspecting. -Full Moon|Saturn|Ketu: over-lap or lord over 2nd and 12th houses from their location i.e. on either side -Jupiter:lords over 3rd and 11th houses from its location. There are ten (10) states of planets based on their location and conjunction etc. They have to be taken into consideration for assessing strength of a planet and its effect in the horoscope. The ten (10) states of existence are: 1.) Exaltation or deeptha: A planet in its exaltation tends to be benefic, even when it should otherwise be a malefic according to other situations in the horoscope. When a person is in a joyous mood like having just married his loved woman, tends to be soft, forgiving and even offer sweets to his bitter and hateful enemy in that jolly mood. Same is the case with the planets in their exaltation and give gains, wealth, status, favours from the government, name and fame etc. 2.) Own Rasi or Swasta: Planet in his own Rasi feels secure, contented and hospitable. Hence bestows wealth, happiness, respectability, position and children."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 67 3.) Rasi of a friend or Mudita: Being in the house of a friend, enjoys hospitality and comforts. Hence a planet in its friend's rasi gives happiness, good clothing, and interest in fine arts. 4.) Friendly Rasi or Friendly Navamsa or Santa: Almost same as Mudita 5.) Retrogression or Sakta: A planet in retrogression becomes powerful as it revisits the same house/sign. A retrograde planet gives courage, success, wealth, fame etc. A planet in its exalted sign or Moolatrikona is powerless when in retrogression; while becomes powerful in its debilitated sign. 6.) In an Inimical House or Deena: When a person resides in this enemies house, he loses all his freedom, comfort and happiness. So naturally will be troubled and humiliated. Same is the case with planets also. Deena state of a planet causes envy, worry, sickness, humiliation, nervousness and the like. 7.) Combustion or Vikala: When any planet is within 8Â° from the Sun ,except Mercury, the planet is said to be in a state of combustion. Its rays are burnt away by the rays of the Sun. Such a state causes disease, loss of near and dear ones, deformity and humiliation. 8.) Debilitation or Khala: When a person is in a very humble circumstances and in a very helpless state, he tends to be envious, hateful, quarrelsome etc. Likewise, a planet in its debilitated Sign becomes powerless to do any good. On the other hand give losses, troubles, quarrels with near and dear ones, loss of position, evil thoughts and bad company and the like. A malefic planet in debilitation cause less harm than a benefic planet. A retrograde (Rx or R) planet in its debilitation sign will become powerful to do good. 9.) Acceleration or Bheeta: Planets move some times faster than their normal acceleration. Such a state is called acceleration. It is presumed that the planet is in fear or bheeti. A person in fear will run for safety, adopting dilatory methods and forgoing many things. Same case with planets also. A planet in acceleration causes enemies, troubles, losses, dirty habits or residence away from native place; in the company of menials. 10.) Situation in the Last part of a Sign or Peeditha: A planet in the last Navamsa of a sign is in the process of entering the next sign. This is transitory position of the planet. When a person is about to leave his residence and village to go to a new place, he will be troubled with clearing all his debts, obligations, etc. and thus will be in a state of harassment or Peeditha. Same case with planets also. A planet in Peeditha stage causes troubles, civil and criminal legal-actions, quarrels, inclination towards theft or pilferage etc. Yoga: "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 68There are 27 Yogas. The Yoga at birth is calculated by adding the sign and longitude of the Moon and Sun. If it is more than 11 signs (Aries being Zero) 12 should be deducted from it and the Yoga corresponding to the sign and longitude should be read like this example: 5S 11° 08' Sun OS 28° 16' Moon 6S 09° 24' or 15th Yoga or Vajra Yoga Vishtambha, Vyatipath, Sula, Vijra, AtigandaVyaghata, 1st half of Parigha, Vydhruti Yogas are inauspicious. BHAVA BALA OR STRENGTH OF THE HUUSE The strength of the Bhava is composed of three factors, namely: 1) House lord potency or Bhavadhipati bala): This takes into consideration the strength of a planet which is the lord of the house. The lordship of the house depends upon the lord of the sign where the mid-point of the house falls. The strength is six-fold known as the six-fold potency of the planet (shadbala pind). 2) Directional strength of the house (Bhava digbala) a) Bipeds or Human signs get 60 shashtiansh wen they are in the first house. If the mid point of the Ascendant fall on Gemini (3), Virgo (6), Libra (7), 1st half of Sagittarius (9) or Aquarius (11) then this ascendant gets 60 shashtiansh. b) Water borne signs or Jalchar signs in 4th house give 60 shashtiansh bala to the house. In such cases, the mid-point of the house should fall in Cancer (4), second half of Capricorn (10B) or Pisces (12). c) Insect sign or keet sign in the 7th house, Scorpio (8) gets 60 shashtiansh. d) Quarduped or Chatuspad sign in 10th House gives 60 shashtiansh to bahva bala. The following signs should fall on the mid-point of the 10th house: Aries (1), Taurus(2), Leo (5), second half of Sagittarius (9B) and 1st half of Capricorn (10 B). e) Houses getting zero potency are; i) Seventh house from the power house ii) Human signs in 7th house iii) Water-borne signs in 10th house iv) Insect signs in 1st house v) Animal sign in 4th house."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 69f) Directional strength of the Bhava: i) Directional strength decrease 10 shastiansh per bhava from the powerful point to powerless point. ii) Directional strength increases @ 10 shastiansh per bhava from the powerless point to the powerful point. 3) Aspectual strength of the House (Bhava drishti bala): a) When strong benefic planets give aspect to the mid-point of a house, the native very good results with respect to the functions or significance of that house. b) One-fourth of aspect value becomes aspect strength which is positive for naturally benefic planets and negative naturally malefic planets. c) Aspects of Jupiter and Mercury are taken in full and not quarter. d) Moon when waning and less tan half gives negative aspect. e) Mercury, even if afflicted, is considered benefic for house aspect potency. i) Sun, Mars and Saturn are malefic and give negative aspect value ii) Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are beenfic and give positive aspect iii) A controversy: Some are of the opinion that a weak Moon gives negative aspect. XX  DIVISIONAL CHARTS OR VARGAS Kalyana Varma has said that without divisional charts, one cannot take a step forward in astrology. It illuminates a bhava where darkness prevails and enables the astrologer to examine bhava specific queries in its minutest detail. Divisional charts are the keys to understanding horoscopes as they unlock that hidden door which refuses to open, even after the astrologer has examined the entire spectrum of variables for analyzing a bhava. So once a bhava has been put under the gaze, and its rashi and the planets housing it and aspecting it, its lord and its dispositor, its strengths and its Navamsa, its karakas and yogas, and drishtis, have all been inspected from every possible angle, and yet clarity is not achieved, divisional charts come to the fore to dispel the clouds of obscurity. V. S. Apte, in Practical Sanskrit- English Dictionary tells us that the meaning of: A) Varga are: subdivision, class, category, section, or group b) mathematical square power 3) strength. B) Amsa are: the shoulder, shoulder-blade; corner of a quadrangle, the two shoulders or angles of an altar, a Portion or share, one who excludes or removes or averts, a separate division , class , set , multitude of similar things (animate or inanimate) , group , company , family , party , side any series or group of words classified together, a class or series of consonants in the alphabet ... (7 such classes: Guttural; Palatals; Cerebrals; Dentals; Labials; Semivowels; Sibilants; and the aspirate h.), everything comprehended under any department or head , everything included under a category , province or sphere of., a section , chapter , division of a book , (in alg.) the square of a number, strength."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 70 1. Divisional strength of a planet: A planet attains strength when it is a) exalted b) in its own moolatrikona c) in own sign d) in a friend’s sign. Planets are considered strong when they are : a) in Kendra (cardinal points) b)in Trikona (Tine) c) areassociated with Kendra or trine lords d) associated or aspected by a natural or functional benefic planet in divisional chart. These planets are capable of giving good results to the native during their main or sub-periods (mahadasa or antar dasha period). In Indian Astrology the power of the Planet is calculated based on its position in 16 different divisions called “Shodasha Varga”. There are 4 groups of these Varga as follows: • Shadvarga • Saptavarga • Dashavarga • Shodashavarga 2. Shadvarga - 6 Divisions Shadvarga consist of Kshetra, Hora, Dreshkan, Saptamansh, Navamansha & Dwadashansha. a) Kshetra (300) - Indicates the actual position of the planet which is calculated from Ephemeris and the Longitude, Latitude of Birth Location. Kshetra Kundali is nothing but the Janma Lagna Kundali. b) Hora (150)- (Finance) indicates the financial gains & financial position of a person. Every sign is divided in 2 parts of 150 each. First part (00 - 150) is called as Ravi (Sun) Hora & the 2nd part (150 - 300) is called as Chandra (Moon) Hora. c) Dreshkan (100) –(Brothers & Sisters) indicates relations with siblings (brothers/sisters)Every sign is split in 3 equal parts of 100 First Dreshkan (00 - 100) belongs to the same sign as Kshetra, 2nd Dreshkan (100 - 200) belongs to the 5th sign from the Kshetra & the 3rd Dreshkan (200 - 300) belongs to the 9th sign from the Kshetra."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 71d) Saptamansh – 7 parts of (30/70) – (Children) indicates the relations with the children. e) Navamansh – 9 parts of (30 20’) – (Married Life & Power of the Planets) indicates the overall married life & the strength of the Planets in the horoscope. f) Dwadashansha - 12 parts of (20 30’) – (Parents) – indicates the relations with the parents. 3.

When a sign of 30` is divided into two halves, then we get 2 divisions of 15` each. In an odd sign (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) the ruler of the first hora is the Sun and ruler of the 2nd hora is the Moon. Similarly, in an even sign (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) the ruler of the 1st hora is the Moon and the ruler of the 2nd hora is the Sun. Hora Odd sign (1,3,5,7,9,11) Even sign(2,4,6,8,10,12) First half 0`-15` 5 Sun 4 Moon Second half 15` -30` 4 Moon 5 Sun Hora is the extension of the second house indiacting wealth, face, complexion, nature and behavious and relationship with other members of the family. There is a school of thought that believes that the first hora of all signs are benefic and are called “Dev Horas”. Sage Parashar in his “Hora Shastra” states: If the Hora Ascendant Lord is the Sun it indictes that the native has come from the land of deities, is ambitious, spiritual, skilled worker and a born leader. Some believe that the native does not belong to the Human Race and has come to perform good virtuous and religious deeds and increases his merits on this earthly sojourn. If the Hora lagna belongs to Moon then the native has come from his forefather’ world or that a family member has taken rebirth and has come to either repay or recover some debts from his parents as Moon represents the mind, nectar and forefathers."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 74If natural malefics occupy the hora ascendant of the Sun the native would be bold, aggressive, courageous, determined, ruthless and rich. Beneifc planets in the Sun’s hora would become less benefic. If natural benefics occupy the Hora lagna the native would be intelligent, genius, humble, loving, sympathetic, helpful co-operative and dedicated worker with a high sense of duty. Malefic planets when posited in Moon’s hora would lose their evil effects. The D 2 chart is different from all other charts since it has only two hourse and not twelve. One is ruled by the Sun (the Atma or super ego) and the other one is ruled by the Moon (emotions, feelings of the heart, sympathy and desires). The planets in the Sun’s hora denote the much needed energy gained or acquired by the native to fulfill the needs while the planets in the Moon’s hora show the inner desire and perceived needs. D/2 chart or Dhana Bhava :\"Field of Psychic Expectation for Matters of Wealth\" In the matter of increased hoarding - savings - wealth: 1. To determine the prognosis for Gain of Wealth, look first (of course) to all the effects upon labha bhava [the 11th house of gain] itself. 2. The house which defines and energizes \"gainfulness\" sits in 3/11 angle to the gainfulness-house: it is dhana bhava, the 2nd house of food-wealth. 3. Clearly, producing income is one of the central goals of the wealth house. 4. Examine dhana bhava in the radix. Will the radix 2nd house generate the community support (11) and personal courage (3) necessary to realize its goals? 5. Outcome depends on the relationship between the 3/11 houses, their rulers and their occupants. 6. Once the radix 3/11 relationship is established, look for confirmation of the \"fruits\" of the 2nd house in the D-2 divisional chart: \"Hora\" The Hora reveals fine detail of how the \"results\" of dhana bhava manifest. 7. The central result of wealth being income, we gain from Hora (presuming an accurate birth time) a confirming level of detail regarding gainfulness, which amounts to whether society is in general for one or against one! 8. D/3 DIVISIONAL CHART OR THE DREKKANA/DRESKHAN CHART Barbara Pijan Lama says that the D-3 varga now commonly called 'drekkana' was probably originally called the 'dreshkhamsha', but may have changed over time, by analogy, to match the Greek term dekka. This process happens in all languages. The definition of a Decanate or Drekkana: A decanate ( Drekkana in Sanskrit ) is 1/3 rd of a house. The 30 degrees Sign divided by 3 is a decanate .The first Drekkana is, therefore, 0 to 10 degrees, the second decanate is 10 to 20 degrees & the third decanate is 20 to 30 degrees.

Interpretation of the three Drekhanas in a sign through Mythology: 1st drekhana (0 to 10 degrees): This part is called Narad which suggests that the ascendant in this rekhana makes the native intelligent, fond of music and travelling. He is noble, versatile, friendly and justice loving. He settles al disputes amicably. 2nd drekhana (10 to 20 degrees): The second part is called Agastya. If the ascendant falls in the second decanate, the native is strong, powerful, noble, determined to achieve goals and destroy his enemies. Sage Agastya humbled the Vindhya mountains, helped Lord Rama to conquer Ravana and drank the whole ocean to destroy the demons hiding in the sea water. 3rd drekhana (20 to 30 degrees): The third part is called Durvasa drekana. If the ascendant falls in this part, the native is aggressive, hot tempered, rigorous and ruthless. He believes in traditions, age old religious customs and practices and any deviation from them would make him angry. He does not hesitate to punish the guilty. Durvasa the hermit cursed many kings at the slightest provocation, causing suffering and misery to his own disciples. He has very strong religious inclination and was a hard taskmaster. He loved perfection. D/3 chart or Drekhann: \"Field of Psychic Expectation for Matters of Siblings & Cousins\" 1. To determine the prognosis for siblings/cousins/competitors/communication patterns, look first (of course) to all the effects upon Bhratru bhava [the radix third house] itself. Bhratru bhava defines how we function on teams, in small groups. 2. The house which defines and energizes \"siblings/competitors/courage\" sits in 3/11 angle to the radix lagna. Tanu bhava is the 1st house of physical body, appearance, social stigma based on your appearance, vitality, musculature, identity. 3. Clearly, achieving good siblings & worthy competitors is one of the central goals of taking birth in a particular class of physical body. 4. Then look to the condition of tanu bhava in the radix.

Once the radix 3/11 relationship is established, look for confirmation of the \"fruits\" of the 1st house in the third divisional chart: D-3/Drekkana. Drekkana reveals fine detail of how the \"results\" of taking a particular class & composition of physical body will manifest in physical, emotional, and mental communication patterns. 7. The central result of having a body being the development of coordinated physical, mental, social, and emotional communication patterns, we gain from Drekkana (presuming an accurate birth time) a confirming level of detail regarding siblings/competitors/small group process. D-3 shows small-group collective thought patterns & this view can help the Jyotishi evaluate the native's mental health. • Gracious and abundant planets in drekkana indicate successful spiritual work in creatively developing one's self and others. If one has tapped into divine identity as it manifests in small-group process, one will likely be empowered by strong & supportive siblings, close neighbors, & team-mates. o Conflicted planets in drekkana indicate unresolved psychic difficulty in the native's subconscious, which will manifest in this life in the intimate mirror of relationships to siblings and team-mates. • The good news is, as always: if unconsciously-continued patterns arise into consciousness, karma is transformed into wisdom and negative implications of the astrological charts may be reversed.

The spouse(s) we marry in the current life have been our spiritual partners in past lives. If we developed compassion and understanding for others in past lives, all should go well indeed. Navamsha is an exceptionally valuable varga for the key questions of life, which all devolve upon how much and what kind of wisdom has been acquired in past lives. Generally matters signified by the \"swamsha\" (lord of navamsha lagna) and the house which swamsha rules in radix, are easy to accomplish in this life due to past-life build-up of skill & wisdom in those matters. (Not necessarily morally good or profitable or approved ... just easy! If swamsha is a criminal planet there will be an easy life of crime.) Navamsha gives a richly detailed micro-view ones' disembodied life conducted through psycho-mental projections. Navamsha represents our psychic field of perception, including hidden assumptions & expectations. What one profoundly expects to happen, will happen! Not what one wishes or hopes or calculates, but subconsciously deeply expects. Particularly we live vicariously through the life of the Spouse. Predictions for Marriage, development of psycho-spiritual awareness, developments in intentional religious education, moral consciousness, and (following from spiritual intentionality) happiness in general are read through the navamsha. The joy and also the unresolved conflict of one's marriage situation is founded upon the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual consciousness which obtained in past life (and which usually continues unconsciously into the present life). A smooth and prosperous navamsha indicates committed spiritual work in previous lives. If you have reflected the divine in others so will others reflect the divine in you. /*79+/0 Differences between D/1 chart and D/9 chart Many scholars are of the opinion that if the: D/1 (rasi) chart is : then the D/9 chart is : 1) The body The backbone 2) The tree The fruit 3) a mere photograph The X-ray photograph A school of thought is of the opinion that : a) a planet occupying exalted, own or friendly sign in D/9 chart would give good and benefic result despite the fact that it is placed in debilitated or inimical sign. b) a planet though ill-placed in D/1 chart would give benefic results, provided its position is improved by aspect, association and lordship the D/9 chart."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 90c) it would be appropriate to observe the D/9 chart along with the D/1 chart and the Moon chart to study malefic and benefic effects of planets. d) D/9 chart has become a supplementary chart to D/1 chart to confirm many aspects of the D/1 chart. e) D/9 chart has been used to study marital bliss, married life and conjugal happiness.

Death can happen when the Moon transits over the 64th navamsa from the Ascendant or from the Natal Moon. Rahu’s transit over the 64th navamsa may cause death of a closer relative. The Lagnesh of the Moon chart could affect the longevity of the native if it has the following configurations to the lord of the 64th navamsa: - life could be short if is inimical to the 64th navamsa lord - life could be of medium length if is neutral to the 64th navamsa lord - life could be long if it is friendly to the lord of the 64th navamsa lord If the lord of the 64th navamsa is posited in 6, 8 or 12th house and is assocated with a) Saturn, the native dies by swallowing poison b) Rahu or Ketu, the native will be hanged till death."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 9111) D/10 OR DASHAMSA A sign of 30` is divided into ten dqual divisions of 3` degrees each, this division is used to construct the D/10 chart.

Nitin Kashyap says in Profession and Dashamsha Lords “In my opinion, prediction of vocation and guidance in professional life can easily be considered to be among one of the toughest areas in Astrology. I have been doing some research on vocation and choice of profession life of people. In the past, there were very limited options as far as jobs are concerned. In this modern day and age, things have changed are in this era of specialization, jobs are too many to choose from. This poses interesting problems for an astrologer to solve. The content in this article is my attempt to apply some of the knowledge passed down by gurus. Dashamsha is the divisional chart that relates to profession and success and failure in professional life should be judged from this chart. I have looked at a few charts to try and derive the modern meaning of Dashamsha.” For assessing professional life, we have to look for the following: • Lord of the Tenth House • Planets aspecting tenth house • Planets situated in tenth house • Tenth House mid point (Bhaav Madhya) If you recall how Dashamsha is calculated, we need to take the longitude of the lagna and see which tenth of rashi division does it fall under. Accordingly, the dashamsha lagna is calculated. These ten parts can be thought of corresponding to ten directions. The lords of these directions along with the significance that can be accorded to them in the current yuga are as follows: • Indra is the king of Gods, i.e. Devraj. He is the head of the department and wields control over other staff in the place of work. • Needless to say, Agni would rule professions related to fire, i.e. jobs that that need a lot of energy and aggression. Police, security and places where a furnace is at the center of affairs. • Yama is puctual, follows rules and is “niyam ka pakka”. He controller institutions that make laws. Naturally, it relates to court of law and associated professions - judges, lawyers, etc. • The mind of a Rakshasa is not constructive and wanders a lot. A Rakshasa has serious problems with authority and with taking advice from others. A Rakshasa is"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 92therefore a law breaker. It can also denote department of municipal corporation in cities that have the responsibility of destrying illegal construction, encroachment etc. • Varun relates to water. Sailor and professions related to ships are professions denoted by Varun. Water is also the basis of all life on earth. Varun can therefore be related to medical profession as well. • Ever changing and freely flowing, Vaayu, i.e. air relates to profession where dissemination of ideas is important. Examples of such professions are - teaching, consulting, writing books, poems etc. Its effect can also make a person change their profession as well. • Kuber presides over the treasury of Gods. His work therefore relates to finance, stock market, banks and currency market. • Ishaan is the son of Brahma. His work relates to taking care of people in need etc. Hence, in the current context, this may be applied to organizations doing social service, e.g. NGOs • Brahma is the creator. His influence on professional life would be towards the manufactering industry. • Literally translated as “infinite”, Anant’s influence would be spread all over the world - akin to working in a multinational company. To work out the Deva/lord that is applicable, the mid point (bhava madhya) of tenth house should be looked at. Based on the sign falling in the tenth house, the following table should be referred to. Degree Odd Sign Even Sign 0° - 3° Indra Anant 3° - 6° Agni Brahma 6° - 9° Yama Ishaan 9° - 12° Rakshasa Kubera 12° - 15° Varun Vaayu 15° - 18° Vaayu Varun 18° - 21° Kubera Rakshasa 21° - 24° Ishaan Yama 24° - 27° Brahma Agni 27° - 30° Anant Indra 12) D/30- TRISHANSH CHART The Trinshansh Divisions of the different signs are given below: Odd signs Degrees Trinsansh ruler Deity Lords Even signs Degrees Trinshansh ruler Deity Lords 1,3, 5,7, 9,11 2,4,6,8,10,12   1 Aries 11 Aquarius 9 0` to 5` 5` to 10` 10` to 18` Mars Saturn Jupiter Mercury Fire Air Indira Kuber 2 Taurus 6 Virgo 12 Pisces 10 0` to 5` 5` - 12` 12` to 20` Venus Mercury Jupiter Saturn Cloud Kuber Indira Air"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 93Sagittarius 3 Gemini 7 Libra 18` to 25` 25` to 30` Venus Cloud Capricorn 8 Scorpio 02` to 25` 25` to 30` Mars Fire - This chart is used to detmine evil influence, adversities, misfortunes, difficulties, obstructions, calamities, etc. - The purpose of assigning lordship to different deities is to ascertain the root-cause of a problem faced by the native and suggest suitable remedial measures.

XXI NAKSHATRAS IN ASTROLOGY In Hindu mythology the Nakshastras, were invented by Daksha, and are personified as daughters of the deity and as mythological wives of Chandra, the moon god. Some even make them the daughters of Kashyapa, the brother of Daksha.[1] A nakshatra or lunar mansion is one of the 27 or 28 divisions of the sky, identified by the prominent star(s) in them, that the Moon passes through during its monthly cycle, as used in Hindu astronomy and astrology. Therefore, each represents a division of the ecliptic similar to the zodiac (13°20’ each instead of the 30° for each zodiac sign). The orbit of the moon is 27.3 days, so the Moon takes approximately one day to pass through each nakshatra. Dr. David Frawley in his Introduction to Nakshatras says “It was to the Moon that the ancient people first looked for calculating time and connecting to the stars. The Moon is the basis of the heavenly clock. The first zodiac, therefore, would have been lunar.” He further says : “theVedic Nakshatras arose from such a spiritual perception of the cosmos. The Nakshatras represent the abodes into which the fruits of our labour, our karma, is transferred and stored. The Nakshatras are the mansions of the Gods or cosmic powers and of the Rashis or sages. They can also project negative or anti-divine forces, just"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 96as certain planets like Saturn have well-know malefic affects.” Some scholars derive Nakshatra from “na” and “kshatras” = not destructible. In Indian astrology the Moon Nakshatra is the main indicator of personality types, much like the Sun sign is in Estern astrology. The Moon’s Nakshatra and its qualities is an important tool of self-discovery and useful for all counselling and psychological purposes, giving an insightful new way to look at the world. The Nakshatras are also the basis of the mantras or primal sounds of he soul used for naming children in India and for yogic practices as well. Each of the nakshatras is governed as 'lord' by one of the nine graha in the following sequence: Ketu (South Lunar Node), Shukra (Venus), Ravi or Surya (Sun), Chandra (Moon), Mangala (Mars), Rahu (North Lunar Node), Guru or Brihaspati (Jupiter), Shani (Saturn) and Budha (Mercury). This cycle repeats itself three times to cover all 27 nakshatras. The lord of each nakshatra determines the planetary period known as the dasha , which is considered of major importance in forecasting the life path of the individual. The list of Nakshatras is found in the Vedic texts (AV 19.7; Taittiriya Samhita) and also in the Shatapatha Brahmana. The first astronomy text that lists them is the Vedanga Jyotisha of Lagadha. The starting point for the nakshatras is the point on the ecliptic directly opposite to the star Spica called Chitrā in Sanskrit (other slightly-different definitions exist). It is called Meshādi or the \"start of Aries\". The ecliptic is divided into each of the nakshatras eastwards starting from this point. Nakshatras and the Three Worlds According to Hindu mythology there are three worlds or 'Lokas': Swarga (Heaven) Loka, Prithvi (Earth) Loka and Mrityu or Narakha (Hell) Loka. The Nakshtras too are divided into three groups or 'Ganas' • Nakshatras- ASHWINI (Horse Woman) : THE STAR OF TRANSPORT o Western star name : β and γArietis (Beta Arietis) o Lord: Ketu (South lunar node) o Symbol : Horse's head Deity : Ashwini Kumaras, the horse-headed twins who are physicians to the gods o Indian zodiac: 0° - 13°20' Mesha ; Western zodiac 26° Aries - 9°20' Taurus Horse Head Ashwini Translation: Horseman Deities :Ashwini Kumars (Health), Shiva, Surya Symbol: Horse”s Head Animal Symbol:Male Horse Greek equivalent: Asklepios, the father of healing in ancient times A good Nakshatra for administering medicines or performing healing work and at times miracles are experienced in this Nakshatra. Shidhra Vyapani Shakti : the power to quickly heal and reach things. Ashvini (aśvinī) is the name of a Hindu constellation (the head of Aries, or the first of the 27 Nakshatras).

The Ashvin are young twins. They are the embodiment of the great power that ushers in the dawn. They represent the movement from darkness to light, from ignorance to knowledge. They are the physicians to the devas, the Gods, and their sacred energy alone is enough to destroy disease and bring about good health. The symbol of the Ashvin is honey. Honey has many miraculous properties, a fact that was known to the peoples of ancient days. Honey is the medicine of the Gods. It has the power to cure many illnesses, it purifies the body of all kinds of taints. It has a beneficial physical, mental and spiritual effect. Sweetness too, is a quality of the Ashvin. Ashwini is the first nakshatra of the zodiac having a spread from 0°-0'-0\" to 13°-20' and is ruled by the node Ketu. Ashwini is governed by the Ashwins, the twin horsemen. The Sun is Exalted here and the horse is the preferred transport of the Sun God. Sun's exaltation in Ashwini is a reminder to the soul of their eternal connection. In the zodiac at 0° in Mesha there is a reddish star which the western astronomers call Arietis. The Indians named it Aswini. The deity for Aswini Nakshatra is Aswi or the Duality known as Aswini Kumar Twins, the physician of the Gods. The Puranas relate that the two Aswini Kumaras were born of mother Sanga and father Ravi. Ashwini nakshatra falls in the zodiac sign of Mesha, which is ruled by the aggressive and fiery planet Mars. The mystic ideas of Asvini the ancients. told in many tales in mythology. The symbolical expression of Asvini is 'Dawn' — personified as the sons (in twin ideas) of Ravi (light) and Chaya (shadow) — day and night; once in the morning and again in the evening. It represents twin ideas — Jnana (wisdom) and Ajnana (ignorance); birth and death creation and destruction; the visible world and the inv invisible space around. In mythology, Asvini kumara— the personified dawn, make their journey across the heaven in three wheeled and spring bearing golden chariots drawn by birds or horses. Asvini is predominantly Tamo Guna an attribute that is so essential for the destruction of evil propensities and to turn to Suva karma. The stories describe that Asvini kumara procured Madhu (honey) for Gods and together with Saraswati (Goddess of knowledge) introduced Soma — wine (spirit) into the cult. They were refused drinks and equal status with Gods but they were reconciled to Indra (God of senses, Indriya) and had to be admitted to Yajna (sacrifice, religious activities; Dharmic karma}. The stories aim to say that it has ability to progress from wrong to right and can assert to secure a rightful position by the help of knowledge. There is an emphasis in their role as helpers and heroes who save and heal. They restored the decrepit Chyavana's youth; saved Bhjyu, the son of Tugru from sinking into the sea and rescued Atri whom the demon had put i.ito a burning pot. They are beautiful, young, quick-moving physicians. Their typical epithet is 'Miraculous' A person born in this Nakshatra is inclined towards serving others, is humble by nature, is truthful, has a contented family life.

The planet of art and beauty, the Venus, rules this nakshatra. The energy of Bharani is called ugra or krura, which translates as harsh, powerful, hot, formidable and fierce. In Hinduism, 'Bharani' is a goddess of good luck.[citation needed] Like her sister Anuradha, she is a daughter of Daksha, and wife of Chandra.. Symbol: Orifice of the.womb (oss-mouth) lord Mangal. It is possible to have an idea of the nature of Bharavi Nakshatra from the nature of Rahu, Mangal and Yama. To take Rahu first: 1. Rahu gives extravagant enjoyment of material pleasure and is later on the cause of sorrow. 2. Mangal gives courage, strength, exaltation and hope 3. Yama purity, cleanliness, justice and integrity. The sense of restraint is also Yama's: gift; he is; the lord of Dharma a stern disciplinarian, a ruthless expositor of truth and a refuge for kings and law-abiding subjects. We should not always confine his interpretation to his being only the lord of death; he is the great judicature the ultimate dispenser of reward and punishment. The story of Yama-Nachiketa is a particularly an exposition of the hospitality of Yama, his. sense; of dharma and knowledge of it, his superb honesty and great integrity and other divine virtues. The Nakshatra of which he is the,;devata-(God) is' also in consequence the ;giver, ;of. enjoyment and. Pleasures, courage and upward thrust of the spirit and on the other hand the giver of whatever is good, pure, truthful and honest. The etymological meaning of Bharani is \"what deserves to be cultivated and preserved\" that is dependence, servitors, retainers or anything by which living is earned, for example salary. In Mesha, next to Asvini, there are three stars in one and are conceived as a triangle without opening. This is called Bharani. The star Bharani represents the character of Agni Rasi Tamo Guna, In a life the destructive forces of Tama Guna and the expressive character of Agni work within and make changes that start from within. It denotes experiences of suffering, suppression, restraint in struggles, strife, contest and such other circumstances as presented by Mangala. The Agni energy provides a great will power, forbearance to withstand it by self-control, discipline. The Devata of Bharani is Yama Dharma Raja (lord of virtues). Truth, duty, morality are the blessings it effects in the life. The effect makes one a saint. The ideas of Bharani are similar to Rahu. who eclipses or hides and then again it releases. Womb has similar function. By name Bharani (from Bharana, Bharana-posana — feeding and rearing up) it connotes the act of maintaining, bearing in the womb, edibles, load, burden, to hire, wages, etc. In mythology Yama is personified as the son of Vibasvan (Surya or Ravi) and the lord of our forefathers. The south is the lord of our forefathers — Pittrijana (Pittri — paternal; jana-vehicle). The abode of God is on the north. Devajana {Deva — God; jana — vehicle, path) is on the north. Bharani gives direction to the south, [Makara to Mithuna clockwise is Devajana; Karkata to Dhanus anticlockwise is Pittrijana.] This star is under the planetary lordship of Venus and is within the sign of Aries, ruled by Mars.

Bharani's animal symbol is the Elephant.This star is connected with the energies we expend to maintain ourselves in the material world. Bharani Nakshatra takes away that which has reached its term of life to a new condition. It shows the movement of the soul away from the body.

Indulgence in sexuality, vanity and narcissism (Mars of Maddona) is observed in this asterism. • Nakshatras- KRITTIKA (One Who Cuts) THE STAR OF FIRE o Western star name: Pleiades (Eta Tauri) o Lord: Ravi (Sun) o Symbol: Knife or spear Deity : Agni, god of fire o Indian zodiac: 26°40' Mesha - 10° Vrishabha ; Western zodiac 22° 40' Taurus - 6° Gemini Razor Krittika is ruled by Agni, the God of Fire. Symbol: Flame or Razor Animal symbol: Female sheep It represent the Dahana Shakti, the power to burn or to cuty away negativity to get to the deepest truth. The star cluster K\u001fttikā, , popularly transliterated \"Krittika\" sometimes known as Kārtikā, corresponds to the open star cluster Pleiades in Indian astronomy and Jyoti\u001fa (Indian astrology). The name literally translates to \"the cutters\". According to Hindu mythology, the god Murugan was raised by the six sisters known as the K\u001fttikā and thus came to be known as Kārtikeya (literally \"Him of the Kārtikā\"). According to the Mahābhārata, Murugan was born to Agni and Svāhā, after the latter impersonated six of the seven wives of the Saptar\u001fi and made love to him. The Saptarshi, hearing of this incident and doubting their wives' chastity, divorced them. These wives then became the K\u001fttikā. Agni is the symbol of brightness and brilliance and all weapons with fire-power. And other things of this same category come within the range of Krittika group. The fire is considered as purifier for it burns away all that is sordid, dark and dull, also all that is low and sinful and inauspicious in the world. The dross thus blazed away, only effulgence and light remain. Fire gives the earth its activity and dynamic and revives it after spells of cold that periodically inflict comatose condition on the earth. It is easy enough to deduce from fire the causal effect of the Krittika group. Mangal is the lord of that part of Krittika which is in Mesa Rasi and Mangal is like a mass of lightning in shining splendor. So the Krittika in Mesha is devastatingly brilliant, the effulgence being closely associated with an incendiary character. The Krittika of Vrshabha Rasi is brilliant but unlike the Krittika of Mesa, is not incendiary. The lord of Vrshabha Rasi is Sukra and Sukra stands for worship of beauty and for poetry and imagination. He is radiantly white like Snow, the ‘Kunda’ flower and the 'Utpal’. He is also the encyclopedic expounder of all branches of learning. It follows that the Krittika of Vrshabha Rasi is brilliant but the brilliance does not burn. It is soft and sweet and benign. The Krittika of Mesha Rasi is doubtless brilliant, it has plenty of heat which burns. The Krittika of Vrshabha Rasi has on the contrary a softened radiance, a wave of brightness that does not hurt. In Western Astrology Krittika has been described as an incendiary star."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 102Devata Agni is the oldest of all gods and used to be worshipped all over the world. Old Romans addressed Him Vesta and worshipped Him without image. “No image Vesta’s semblance can express Fire is too subtle to admit of dress” 'Agni remains hidden in wood, plants and water [terrestrial or aerial] Born in the sky it descends in form of lightning and the Sun and is the source of energy. It is at the root of all creation and expression of speech. In mythology it is ‘Master of the House, Domestic god and head of the clan’. There are many names of Agni, each is used in inviting and worshipping Agni for particular function and occasion. Krittika, therefore, denotes capability to give a desired change in a form by burning out all the impurities of life or the wrongs and give birth to purity, morality and virtues. Mythology describes Krittika as the foster mother of Kartik devata who is beautiful in appearance and an able commander in a battle. He is still worshipped in South India. The ideas of Krittika are related to the ideas of a commander, fighter, a foster mother, nurse or an adopted child;. Since the root power of every action is Agni, either action of the senses, or digestion, or the existence of life, it is first worshipped in all Pujas (divine service). For different actions (Karmas) the same Agni is worshipped by different names. Agni is conceived in three planes physical, mental and spiritual. Krittika in Mesa (Tamo Guna) represents physical creative force. Krittika in Vrshabha (Raja Guna) represents the function of Agni (creative faculty) in mental plane. Krittika by name connotes Kirti — a great achievement, monumental deeds that are famous; Kartan — to cut, divide, to trim; also its instrument, viz., sword, knife, razor, etc. In Krittika the portion that is in Mesa has ideas of burning sensations or feelings. It may be the fire of the stomach, body or mind. This is due to the characteristic of Mesa and Mangala. But Krittika in Vrshabha speaks for luster and glow of power, full of warmth and feelings. This is due to ideas of Vrshabha and Sukra. Krittika is also known as the \"Star of Fire\" and is related to a commander, fighter, foster mother, lustre, glow of power, physical and creative force. Krittika being a female nakshatra suggests passivity, indicating that Krittika needs outer energy or life circumstance to activate their power. This is the third nakshatra of the zodiac, spanning 26°-40' in Mesha to 10°-00' in Vrishabha. Kritikka is considered the nakshatra where power is born. This is the birth star of Chandra. The passivity of this nakshatra represents their ability to nurture power. Mythology describes Krittika as the foster mother of Kartik devata who is beautiful in appearance and an able commander in a battle. Krittika Nakshatra burns up negativity, purifies what is mixed, and cooks or prepares that which is not yet ripe.This nakshatra rules war, battles, and disputes. Planets in Krittika activate its passive energy. Krittika denotes capability to give a desired change in a form by burning out all the impurities of life or the wrongs and give birth to purity, morality and virtues."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 103People with this nakshatra have a cutting wit and can be sarcastic and critical.

Gandha is the Guna of Prthvi therefore, in Rohini it is perfume, fragrant. The other name of Rohini is Suravi – the celestial cow; it has ability to give whatever is wanted from it.

It has power to secretly travel or penetrate into a place where ordinarily it is impossible to go. Such power is depicted by the name Chandra-Ketu — another name of Siva — the lord of wisdom.

"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 14312 factors for matrimonial alliance, out of which first 8 are important: Horoscope compatibility is judged by points, known as kuta. These points are calculated by taking into account the position of Moon in both the charts. Moon in a person’s chart represents the emotional aspect, his/her personality and capacity to care about other people. 1) VARNA 2) VASYA 3) DINA (TARA) 4) YONI RASHYADHIPAT 6) GUNA 7)RASI (SHAKUTA) 8) NADI 9) MAHENDRA 10) STREE-DREEGA 11) RAJJU 12)VEDHA. The main factors considered on the basis of the moonsign for matching or horoscopes are : 1.Varna (spiritual or ego development) – 1 point allotted for this. It indicates the spiritual development and maturity of the soul. In the Hindu religious system society is categorized into four castes depending on their duties namely Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vysyas and sudras. The rashis are classified as follows : Brahmins : Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio Kshatriyas : Aries, Leo and Sagittarius Vysas : Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn Sudras : Gemini. Libra and Aquarius It is considered to be the best that the Bridegroom and the bride belong to the same varna and it it is -different then the varna of the bridegroom should be superior to that of the bride. 2.Vasya (Magnetic control and amenability) – 2 points are allotted for this. Here again the rashis are divided into three categories – - Nara Rashis( two legged) – Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius, first part and Aquarius - Chatushpada Rashis( four legged) : Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius second part and Capricorn - Jala Rashis(water) – Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces It is favourable if both the bride and groom belong to the same varga and then the other things come in. This suggests the magnetic control or amenability the husband or wife would be able to show each other. 3.Graha Maitri or Rasyadhipati ( Psyhchological disposition, mental qualities and affection ) 5 points are allotted for this in this the relationship between the lords of the janma rashis of the two people are concerned as friends, neutrals and enemies. This is supposed to deal with the psychological dispositions of the couple, their mental qualities and their affection for each other. 4. Rasi Kuta – For this 7 points are allotted, in this the distance between the janma rashis of the bridegroom and the bride is considered. When the bridegroom’s janma rashi from the bride’s janma rashi is in 1st,7th,8th, 9th,10th or 12th then full 7 points are given. If it is in 2nd ,3rd,4th,5th or 6th then no points are given."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 1445. Dina kuta or Tara Bala – 3 points are allotted for this, the nakshatra of the bridegroom is counted from that of the bride or vice-versa and divide the number by 9. If the remainder is 1,3,5,7 then no points are given. If from one side favourable and from the other side unfavourable, then give 1½ points. In Dina kuta the couple’s health and family happiness is indicated. 6.Yoni Kuta – 4 points are allotted to this and this implies bodily physical contact or sexual compatibility. All the 27 nakshatras have been assigned certain animals for Male and female. Marriage between Nakshatras indicating same class of yoni and between the male and female constellations of that yoni is said to be conducive to great happiness, perfect harmony and progeny. 7.Gana Kuta – 6 points are allotted to this, this seems to have an important bearing on the compatibility of temperament and character of the couple concerned. Astrologically, three ganas( temperament) are recongnized i.e Deva (divine), Manusha (Human) and Rakshasha (diabolic). Dev gana – Ashwini, Mrigshira, Punarvasu, Pushya, Hasta, Swati,Anuradha, Sravana and Revathi Manushya Gana – Bharini, Rohini, Aridra, Poorvaphalguni, Uttaraphalgni,Poorvashada, Uttarashada,Poorvabhadrapada and Uttarabhadrapada."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 145Rakshasha Gana – Krittika, Ashlesha,Magha, Chitra, Vishakha, Jyestha, Moola, Dhanishta and Shatabisha 8. Nadi Kuta – 8 points are allotted, this aspect signifies the pulse or the nervous energy indicating the physiological and to a certain amount of hereditary factors. The three nadis enumerated are Vatha (wind), Pitta (bile), Sleshma (phelgm), these are given nomenclatures as Adi, Madhya and Anthya respectively. If the Nakshatras of the bridegroom and the bride fall in different rows, then the agreement between the couple will be good. Kuta without points 9. Mahendra Kuta: Blessings in the married life; Well-being; Longevity Principle: If the Girl is born in the 4th Nakshatra from that of the Boy, it is Mahendra; if she is born in the 7th, it is known as Upendra. Mahendra gives wealth and Upendra gives children. Many say that nakshatra of the boy counted from that of the girl (both inclusive) should be 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd or 25th. This promotes well being and increases longevity. 10. Stri Deergha: Long life to the Husband Principle: The male Nakshatra should be beyond 9th from the girl; some say more than 15 stars away from that of the female. If that is not so, long life of the male is not supported. Other factors like Navamsa have to be considered. Rider: This consideration can be ignored if Rasi Kuta and Graha Maitri is there.. 11. Rajju Kuta: This indicates the strength and or duration of married life.The Asterism can be classified into 5 categories namely: Rajju Body part Nakshatra group Indications if the Janma nakshatra falls in the same Rajju Kantha Throat (neck) Rohini, Ardra, Hasta, Swati, Sravana, Satabhista   Widowhood – death of wife Kati Waist Bharni, Pushya, Purva Paalguni, Anuradha, Purva Ashada, Uttara Bhadrapada   Poverty Pada Feet Ashwini, Ashlesha, Magha, Jayestha, Moola, Revati   Wanderer or distant traveller Siro Head Mrigashira, Chitra, Dhanista Husband’s death Kukshi (Nabhi) Navel Kritiaka, Punarvasu, Uttara Phalguni, Vishaka, Uttara Phalguni, Purva Bhadrapada   Loss of children"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 146This Kuta need not be considered if the kutas of Rashyadhipati, Rasi, Dina(Tara) and Mahendra match. 12. Vedha: Vedha means afflictions and it causes obstacles in married life. Principle 1: The following pairs affect each other. Nakshatra of the couple should not fall in the vedha group as mentioned below. - Aswini and Jyeshta; -Bharani and Anuradha; -Krittika and Visakha; -Rohini and Swati; -Aridra and Sravana -Punarvasu and Uttarashadha; - Pusayami and Purvashadha; -Aslesha and Moola; -Makha and Revati; -Purvaphalguni and Uttarabhadrapada; -Uttaraphalguni and Purvabhadrapada; -Hasta and Satabhisha, -Mrigasira and Dhanishta. Principle 2: Even if there is other agreement such as Vasya, etc., Vedha will prevail. - MANGAL DOSHA Rishi Parashara, in his Brihat Parasara Horasastra, chapter 81, verse 47 said the following: \"If Mars is placed in the Lagna, 12th, 4th, 7th and 8th houses, without any aspect or conjunction of the benefic planets, the husband of such a woman will certainly have an early death.\" So it is clear that if Mars has the aspect or association of a benefic, there is no dosha. It must be noted that in the very next verse, verse 48, he gave the other important exception as follows: \"The yoga in which a woman takes birth and becomes a widow, if a male takes birth, he also becomes a widower. If a woman with the widowhood yoga marries a man with similar yoga, such yoga will be cancelled.\" So the 2nd exception given by him is that this feared dosha is cancelled if both the girl and the boy have mangal dosha. Presense of Mars in houses 1, 4, 7, 8, and 12 usually causes dosha. However, like all other rules, this rule exceptions too No Dosha for Leo and Aquarius signs and/or Lagnas, No Dosha when Mars is in 2nd house, in the signs of Gemini and Virgo, No Dosha when Mars is in 4th house, in the signs of Aries and Scorpio, No Dosha when Mars is in 7th house, in the signs of Cancer and Capricorn, No Dosha when Mars is in 8th house, in the signs of Sagittarius and Pisces signs No Dosha when Mars is in 12th house, in the signs of Taurus and Libra Apart from that, some of the exceptions are: - Association of Mars with Jupiter and Saturn in certain cases cancels the dosha - Retrograde mars does not cause dosha. - A weak mars (e.g. combust, situated near rashi sandhi) loses ability to cause dosha."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 147What is Mangal Dosh? When Mars is located in any of the houses shown in the horoscope, the horoscope is said to have \"Mangal Dosh\". i.e. if Marsh is in first house, fourth, seventh, eighth or twelfth house person is having \"Mangal Dosh\". What is Mangal Dosh? When Mars is located in any of the houses shown in the horoscope, the horoscope is said to have \"Mangal Dosh\". i.e. if Mars is in first house, fourth, seventh, eighth or twelfth house person is having \"Mangal Dosh\". Why is it considered as a drawback during marriage?Mars affects the 4th, 7th & 8th house from the house in which it is placed. This is called \"Mangal Drushti\". Mars is a planet which is representative of fire, electricity, chemicals, weapons, aggression, high energy, blood, fight, accident etc... Let's see what are the repercussions of Marsh located in these houses. Whichever house it is located or has its drushti, effects of Mangal are experienced in the aspects of life represented by that house. 1) 1st house: if Mars is placed in the 1st house it will affect 4th, 7th & 8th house in addition to 1st. 1st house represents the personality of the person, hence person may be very short tempered. 4th house represents the house, vehicles of the person, hence there is a possibility of problems associated with house & vehicle e.g. accident due to fire, chemicals, electricity etc...7th house represents the Marital Life, spouse & business in partnership, hence there is a possibility of turbulent married life, spouse may be of very hot tempered nature, loss in partnership etc... 8th house represents death, sudden monetary gains etc... hence there is a possibility of fatal accident to the person. Of course these are very broad guidelines. Many other angles need to be studied like the overall quality of the horoscope, power of the planets, aspects of the planets etc... 2) 4th House: If it is placed in the 4th house it will affect 7th, 10th & 11th house in addition to 4th house. We have seen effects on 4th & 7th house. 10th house represents career, father, sleep etc... hence there is a possibility of frequent changes/disturbances in the career, sleep disorder, issues with father or even early death of father etc... 11th house indicates the monetary gains in life, hence there is a possibility of losses due to accidents, theft etc... 3) 7th House: Mars in 7th house affects 10th, 1st & 2nd house in addition to 7th. 2nd house is the house that gives the idea about the wealth of the person. It indicates the family of the person & it is also the 8th house from 7th house indicating death of the married life/business in partnership. Hence Marsh drushti on this house can create issues among the family members, there is a less harmony among the members due to short tempered & aggressive behaviors. So also there are chances of loss of money. 4) 8th House: It affects 11th, 2nd & 3rd house. 3rd house represents brothers & sisters of a person, the verbal communication skills, voice of the person, achievements of the person. Hence Mars might create tensions among siblings, person may be very rude & arrogant in speaking, might hurt others quite often & may suffer more failures than successes."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 1485) 12th House: Mars in 12th house affects 3rd, 6th & 7th house. 12th house indicates the spending nature of the person. Hence person may be of over spending nature. 6th house indicates diseases, thefts due to servants, maternal uncle etc...person is likely to have diseases caused due to acidity, hyper tension, blood diseases etc... Thus you will observer that if the Mars is troublesome in these houses which affect the married life substantially. Hence horoscope with Mangal Dosh is treated unsuitable. What precaution is to be taken while checking the position of the Marsh in the horoscope? First & foremost the horoscope MUST be \"Bhavachalit Kundali\" & not the genaral Lagna Kundali. It is advisable to consult an expert Astrologer in taking decision in case of Mangal Dosh. Under what circumstances the \"Mangal Dosh\" is not considered \"Dosh\"? If Mars is \"Neech\" i.e. in Cancer If Mars is in the enemy house i.e. in Gemini or Virgo, If Mars is \"Astangat\" extinguished i.e. near Sun. If Mars is in Aries in 1st house If Mars is in Scorpion in 4th house If Mars is in Capricorn in 7th house If Mars is in Leo in 8th house If Mars is in Sagittarius in 12th house. Under what circumstances Marsh is treated as Mild? If Mars is receiving drushti from any \"Shubh\" planet i.e. Jupiter, Venus, Moon & Mercury, it is treated to be a mild \"Mangal\". What situations in the horoscope of the spouse is treated as matching with the horoscope having \"Mangal Dosh\"? If the horoscope of the spouse has any of the following star positions, it is complementary to the person having \"Mangal Dosh\" & hence the two can be considered to be match for each other. If Saturn is in 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th or 12th house. If Saturn is affecting 7th house with \" 3rd or 10th Drushti\" i.e. if Saturn is in 5th or 10th house. If Powerful Jupiter (In Cancer, Sagittarius, Pisces or Vargottam, Uchcha Navamansh or swanavamansh etc...), or Powerful Venus (in Pisces, Taurus or Libra or Vargottam, Uchcha Navamansh, Svanavamansh etc...) is placed in 1st house, If 7th house is affected by Jupiter's 5th or 9th drushti i.e. Jupiter is placed in 3rd or 11th house.

Adi is eternal, absolute, and immutable while Aditi is a reflection of Adi. The Vedas used Adi in the sense Brahma was used in subsequent scriptures.

She is frequently implored for blessing children and cattle, for protection and forgiveness. In the Yajur Veda, Aditi is addressed as the support of the sky, the sustainer of the earth, the sovereign of this world, and the wife of Vishnu. The Vishnu Purana describes Aditi, the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, to be the mother of 8 Adityas (q.v.), including Vishnu and other shining ones. According to the Matsya Purana, Indra gave to Aditi a pair of earrings that were produced by the churning of the ocean. Several Puranic stories refer to these earrings being stolen and taken to the city of Prag Jyotish by the Asura king Naraka, from where they were brought back and restored to Aditi by Krishna. Occult tradition establishes a close resemblance between Krishna, Aditi and the Cosmic Mother principle. Aditi gave birth to 8 Adityas (q.v.), of whom the 8th one, Martand, the present Sun of the present solar system, was cast away as a 'dead egg'. In the Mahabharata there is a reference to Devaki who bore eight fetuses, of which seven were destroyed by Kamsa while the eighth one, which was Krishna, was transported to Gokula by her husband, Vasudeva. In such legends, Devaki, the mother of Krishna, is represented as a new birth, or manifestation of Aditi, and Krishna of the Sun connected with the origin and nourishment of the earth. Aditi is variously represented in Indian occult literature. Besides being the goddess who mothered 8 Sun gods, she even represents Prithvi, the mother earth, Vach, the goddess of speech who articulates noumenon into creative impulse, and in southern Buddhist schools, she is identified with Akasha, the all-pervading substratum of all manifestation, and with Nirvana, liberation. She represents the Great Deep, the primeval waters of space, the chaos, and the celestial Virgin Mother of all the visible and invisible universes, and the primordial light, which provides life and substance to every form of creation. Aditi is symbolized as the central point in the Sun symbol. Aditi presides over the 7th asterism, Punarvasu. Mees states that Aditi has six or seven forms as applying to six or seven spheres or twelve forms referring to the stages of spiritual path connected with the twelve signs of the zodiac. Blavatsky refers to it as the Vedic name for Mulaprakriti (q.v.). She even considers Aditi as the mother of gods, or Sheikinah, the eternal light; in the world of spirit, the great deep and chaos, or the primordial substance in its first remove from the unknown in the manifested cosmos. Aurobindo states that Aditi is 'both the cow and the general Mother; she is the Supreme Light and all radiances proceed from her. Psychologically, Aditi is the supreme and infinite consciousness, represented as mother of the gods.' ADITYA :Meaning, born of Aditi. Born as Vivaswan, a son of Kashyapa and Aditi, Adityas are divine intelligence supervising and maintaining the cosmic evolutionary process. They are also known as Suryas, Vasus, and by several other names. The root number 33 in Hindu occultism stands for the 12 Adityas, 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, and 2 Ashwinis, all presenting different aspects of the same primeval impulse. Adityas represent the creative expression of the primordial effulgence of life. Brahma is said to have created them for assisting him in his evolutionary task but they refused to do so considering it to be an impure involvement. An infuriated Brahma cursed them to be born repeatedly at the beginning of every Kalpa (q.v.). They are also called Ajitas, Tushitas, Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sadhyas, and Adityas on different occasions. Aditi is said to have given birth to 8 Adityas, 7 of whom she gave to the gods, and they became different planets. The eighth one, named Martand, was thought dead and was cast away. It became the Sun of the present solar system. The Puranic stories mention the Sun (Vivaswan) to be married to Tvastri (Sanjna), daughter of the celestial architect Tvastra or Vishwakarma. But she was unable to bear his effulgence, so having left her shadow,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 152Chhaya, to look after him she went to her father, who sheared much of the Suns radiance. From the fragments thus chipped off, the discus of Vishnu, the trident of Shiva, the weapons of Kubera, the lance of Kartikeya and such other deadly weapons of several other gods were formed. The Sun, or the Aditya, is supposed to have a large family. He has three wives, viz., Sanjna, Ragyi, and Prabha, besides Chhaya, formed from the shadow of Sanjna. A king named Raivat was born of Ragyi, Prabhat was born of Prabha. From Sanjna the Sun had two sons, viz., Vaivasvata Manu and Yama, and a daughter called Yamuna. Yama and Yamuna are said to be twins. From Chhaya, the Sun begot Savarni Manu, Sani (Saturn) and Vishti. The two Manus are related with racial evolution and social reorganisation of different human races during the different periods of manifestation or Manvantara. Yama became the god of death, and Sani is the planet related with death. Yama presides over the planet Saturn. Yamuna avid Tapti are two important rivers of north and south India. Vishti is a very fierce-looking demoness, connected with Time. Away from her husband, Sanjna assumed the form of a mare and began wandering in the universe. When the Sun became aware of the deception, he assumed the form of a horse and, having found her in her new form, produced the two Ashwini Kumars (q.v.). There are many stories of the Sun's seductions. The Sun begot Karna from Kunti before she was married to Pandu. It was supposed to be an immaculate birth, without destroying her virginity. Karna became a hero of the Mahabharata and in many ways excelled Arjuna in bravery and military skill. It was difficult to vanquish him until he removed his armour on his own volition. The Sun also fathered Sugriva, the monkey chief who helped Rama trace and retrieve his abducted wife Sita, from the clutches of Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. Sugriva also provided the necessary monkey army to Rama in his fight with Ravana. It is said that Aditya gave the Syamantaka jewel to Satrajit, the father of Krishna's wife, Satyabhama. As Martand, Aditya received from his mother the earrings obtained from the churning of the ocean which enabled him to maintain stability during his constant strife with his brothers. In the form of a horse, Aditya communicated Sweta Yajura Veda to Yajnavalka. Blavatsky describes Aditya as \"neither Sun, nor Moon, nor stars, but the eternal sustainer of the luminous life which exists as it were behind all the phenomena.\" She further says: the Radiant Child of the Two, the unparalleled refulgent Glory-Bright Space, Son of Dark Space, who emerges from the Depths of the great Dark Waters. He shines forth as the Sun, he is the Blazing Divine Dragon of Wisdom. Behold him lifting the Veil, and unfurling it from East to West. He shuts out the Above, and leaves the Below to be seen as the Great Illusion. He marks the places for the Shining Ones, and turns the Upper into a Shoeless Sea of Fire, and the One Manifested into the Great Waters.\" ADVAITA :[(A = not) + (Dvaita = duality)]. The non-dualistic school of Vedantic philosophy founded by Sankaracharya stressing the Supreme as one and the only one causeless cause of all. A philosophical system of absolute monotheism. AFFLICTION :Adverse planetary effect. It arises in many ways, e.g. (1) placement of planets in the 6th, 8th, and/or 12th houses or their ruler ship of these houses; (2) association of a house or a planet with malefic Saturn, Mars, or Rahu; (3) occupation of Badhaka (q.v.) planets in a house or their association with any other planet; (4) Combustion (q.v.) of a planet; or (5) association of Sun with Saturn, Rahu or Ketu. Affliction is also caused to a planet if it occupies an inauspicious asterism. AGASTYA :[(Aga = the immovable, a mountain) + (Asti = thrower); (Aga = pitcher) + (Asti =to exist)]. An ancient patron saint of Vedic astrology associated with the star Canopus. Tradition claims him to be still living in the South Indian hills where he went to teach science and literature and to revive occult teachings. Some spiritualists believe him to be middle-aged with Grey hair, often coming into physical contact with the disciples, though"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 153precluded from the purview of visitors. Yet he is said to be as old as the Vedas. Many hymns in the Rig veda are attributed to him. He and Vashishtha are said to be the offspring of Mitra and Varuna (q.v.) whose seed fell from them at the sight of Urvasi, a celestial nymph. Lest the vital energy thus released be wasted, it was preserved in an earthen pitcher and at the appropriate time, born as a fish of great lustre'. As he was very small when he was born, not more than a span in length, he was called Mana, meaning a standard measure. It is said that Agastya drank the entire ocean when it did not stop giving shelter to fugitive demons. He pushed down the Vindhya mountains when they insisted on obstructing the path of the Sun. He devoured the demon Vatapi and burnt to ashes his brother Ilwala, because they were destroying the Brahmin priests. In the Ramayana, he is said to have received Rama, his wife Sita and younger brother Lakshmana at his hermitage and presented Rama with the bow of Vishnu, the arrows of Brahma, the quiver of Indra, and an invincible sword. He also presented him with a rare jewel obtained from the dead king Sweta. Agastya redeemed his ancestors, suspended by their heels, by begetting a son, which he did by marrying a girl whom he had formed out of the most graceful parts of different animals. The sage is also said to have been related to the Rakshasas through his previous birth. According to Blavatsky, Pulashya, a Prajapati or a mind-born son of Brahma, who was the progenitor of Rakshasas, had in a former birth a son named Dattoli, who was later known as Sage Agastya. Dattoli alone has six more variants to it, or seven meanings. He is called Dattoli, Dattali, Dattotti, Dattottri, Dambhobhi and Dambholi. These seven variants have each, according to Blavatsky, a secret sense, and refer in the esoteric commentaries to different ethnological classifications, and also to physiological and anthropological mysteries of the primitive races. AGNI :Meaning (i) fire, god of fire, viz., Vaishvanara in the Rig Veda; (ii) personified primordial light, Bhuranya, the rapid carrier of Divine Spark; (iii) first emanation in the triple manifestation of spirit, force, and matter; (iv) central spiritual Sun, and (v) the electrical fire of life. One of the most ancient and most sacred objects of Hindu worship, Agni appears in three phases: G) as Sun in heaven, GO as lightning in midair, and (iii) as ordinary fire on earth. Agni is one of the three great deities in the Vedas, viz., Agni, Vayu (or Indra) and Surya, who preside on earth, air and sky, respectively, and are equal in dignity. Agni is considered as the mediator between men and gods, as protector of men and their homes, and a witness to their actions. Agni is one of the Panch Bhutas (q.v.) and represents the primordial fire which carries forth life essence in all forms of manifestation. It exists in them, either in latency or expressed in their actions. In the Puranas, fire in pre-manifestation state represents Shiva as a shaft of light which Brahma and Vishnu together were unsuccessful in exploring and locating its source. Brahma is also said to be the progenitor of fire as one of his sons married a daughter of Daksha and produced 49 types of fire. According to another story, Indra, an offspring of Kashyapa and Aditi, is considered identical with Agni as well as the Sun. Agni emanated from the mouth of the Supreme; he later manifested the cosmos and revealed the sacredness of the Vedas. His carTier is a ram (which also means the first asterism, Aries). Agni had three sons, Pavaka, Pavamana, and Suchi, who were condemned by Vashistha to be born repeatedly. They appear as Vidyuta (electrical fire), Nirmatya (fire produced by friction) and Suchi, as the solar flare. From Pavaka was born Kavyavahana, the fire of Pitris (q.v.; from Pavamana was born Saharaksha, the fire of the Asuras or the demons; and from Suchi was born Havyavahana, the fire of the gods. The three sons of Agni had 45 sons, so the family had altogether 49 persons identified with the 49 fires. They produced physical, psychic and spiritual energies in men by their permutations and combinations."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 154Agni is represented as having seven tongues, each of which has a distinct name and function. He has four hands and is borne in a chariot drawn by red horses, and the seven winds are the wheels of his car. He is accompanied by a ram, on which he is sometimes represented as riding. The seven flames of fire are named Kali (black), Karali (fierce), Manojava (mind-swift), Sulohita (blood-red), Sudhumravarna (smoke-coloured), Vishwaruch-devi (universally attractive), and Sphulingini (scintillating). They are the seven channels of cosmic, mundane and human evolutions; they represent the seven rays of the Sun, represented by seven horses of its chariot, or the seven heads of a single horse in it. The seven channels each with seven subsidiary currents make a total of 49 fires which move in both outgoing and in going directions. The fire manifests as Prana (q.v.), the vital life force in the physical body; as Kama, sexual passion in man's emotional nature; Manas, as the thinking principle in his mind-body; and Tapas, penance with austere sacrifices at the spiritual level. The total sacrifice of one's everyday life for one's divine nature or for the Supreme Being is represented by Swaha, the sacrificial fire. The fire aroused by Pavamana forges a union between thinking principle and Buddhic consciousness, thereby leading to an illumined mind which unfolds higher spiritual attributes in man. The Sun is the visible symbol of cosmic fire functioning in the solar system; it vibrates at the highest spiritual level in man. Mars represents fire at the physical level, imparting to it the necessary vigour, enthusiasm and initiative. Jupiter absorbs the life force radiating from the Sun, and distributes it throughout the body for sustaining and protecting it from any untoward calamity. Agni presides over Krittika and Vishakha asterisms and is also related to Aridra, Hastha and Purva Bhadrapada. Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are fiery zodiacal signs. The importance of fire and therefore of the stellar impulses linked with it in manifestation and everyday existence was emphasized by H.P. Blavatsky as follows: The Spirit beyond Manifested Nature is the fiery Breath in its absolute Unity. In the manifested Universe, it is the Central Spiritual Sun, the electric Fire of all Life. In our System, it is The visible Sun, the Spirit of Nature, the terrestrial God. And in, on and around the Earth, the fiery spirit thereof-Air, fluidic Fire; water, the liquid Fire; Earth, the solid Fire. All is Fire . . . The primitive names of the Gods are all connected with fire, from Agni. AGNI BHU :Born out of fire; Kartikeya AGNIHOTRA :Oblation to and maintenance of the sacred fire. AGNIHOTRI :The priest who served the fire god and performed Agni Hotra every morning and evening as a duty enjoined upon the householders, offering Homa, oblations, to it. AGNIVESHA :A sage, a son of Agni, and an ancient writer on medicine. AHALYA :The most beautiful woman created by Brahma and given in marriage to Gautam (q.v.); He returned her undefiled even when she was kept under his charge for more than a year. Indra, in the guise of Sage Gautam, seduced her. Gautam, on discovering it, cursed Indra to have a thousand female generative organs on his body, which later, at the intercession of the gods, was changed to a thousand eyes. But Indra once again seduced Ahalya and this time the sage turned Ahalya into a stone. She was redeemed thousands of years later when she was touched by the feet of Rama. There are many, variations of this story. According to one, Gautam expelled Ahalya from his hermitage and deprived her of her, prerogative of being the most beautiful woman in the world. According to another story, he made her invisible, to be restored to her physical form only by the touch of Rama's feet. This episode of Ahalya's seduction by Indra is explained mythological as Indra (Sun's carrying away the shades of night, as the name Ahalya also means and signifies night. AHAMKARA :[(Aham = self) + (Kara = maker)] Egotism, self-love born of avidya (q.v.), spiritual ignorance; the conception of \"I\" distinguished from the universal One-Self"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 155personality. In Vedanta, it is considered as the third of 8 producers of illusory creation in the sense of conceit, or the conception of individuality. It is rooted in the nature of Manas, the thinking principle, which arises from Mahat, the illumined mind. It is dual in nature as it has affinity with Atma-Buddhi as well as with the physical counterpart of man. Astrologically, Mercury produces self-conceit as well as spiritual ignorance, Avidya, especially when it is associated with the materialistically afflicted Sun, or when it is adversely aspected or is conjunct with Saturn or the nodes of the Moon (Rahu). AHI :A serpent, a thief, the shadowy planet Rahu. In the Vedas, Ahi is a demon representing egotism and ignorance. It personifies thirst for life, lack of moisture, and existence of drought. Yet as Dhyan Chohans, it stands for mighty intelligent forces which give rise to and enact her laws in nature while themselves acting in accordance with laws imposed on them by yet higher powers. As a demonic power, Ahi was Vritra: (q.v.), the serpent of ignorance killed by Indra to save the world from destruction. Ahi represents the Sun and Rahu. As Naga it presides over Ashlesha (q.v.) and as Ahir-Budhanya it imparts wisdom to Uttara Bhadrapada (q.v.). AHIRBUDHANYA :Also known as a dragon of the deep. It is one of the 11 primary Rudras (q.v.) produced by Sage Kashyapa and Surabhi, who was one of the daughters of Daksha Prajapati (q.v.). Ahirbudhanya produced 80 million invincible trident-holding secondary Rudras who were spread in all directions to protect mankind. Along with Ajaikapada, another primary Rudra, he formed the dual principles of light and darkness, heat and cold, and is personified, as Agni while Ajaikapada is Soma. Ajaikapada and Ahirbudhanya preside over Purva and Uttara Bhadrapadas (q.v.), respectively. AHIRVRITRA :The dragon of primordial ignorance, which lies concealed in primeval darkness. AJA :Meaning unborn, eternal Brahma, the zodiacal sign of Aries, a name of Moon and of Kamadeva. Born from the heart of Brahma, it is also known as Atmabhu, self-existent. It stands for the manifest deity, which is an outer cover of the ever concealed. It represents the primeval thirst for sentient existence personified by Kamadeva (q.v.). Aries is known as Aja, which induces externalisation process and produces the energy to blossom in splendour. Aja is an epithet applied to many gods. It is also, the name of a prince in the solar race of kings sometimes he is said to be the son of Raghu and at other times the son of Dilip the son of Raghu. He redeemed a celestial musician, a gandharva, transformed as a mad elephant. On his release, the gandharva gave Aja certain arrows, which enabled him to win and marry Indumati, the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, in a Swayamvara (where a bride herself selects her husband). When their son Dasharath, the father of Rama, grew up, Aja ascended to Indra's heaven. AJA-EKA-PADA/AJAIKAPADA :[(Aja = ram) + (Eka = one) + (Pada = foot)]. Presiding deity of Purva Bhadrapada (q.v.), a primary Rudra born of Kashyapa and Surabhi, represents the sure-footed goat. It is transcendent cosmic energy, referred in the Atharva Veda along with Rohit, primarily concerned with producing heaven and earth. Ajaikapada establishes itself as the Sun to nourish the universe. (See Ahirbudhanya) AJITAS :Unconquered. A title given to Vishnu, Shiva and many others. These are 12 classes of gods incarnating in each Manvantara (q.v.) and are often identified as Kumaras (q.v.), an epithet of Jnana Devas. AJNA CHAKRA :[Ajna = to command) + (Chakra = wheel, energy centre)]. A term used in yogic literature to mean the energy centre located between the eyebrows. Also known as Brow Chakra. AKASHA :Meaning sky, ether. A term with different meanings to different systems of Indian philosophy. It stands for the subtle, supersensuous, spiritual essence pervading all space. The cosmic void in which the entire manifestation takes place. In the latter, Aditi"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 156(q.v. personifies the Vedic concept of Void. The Vedantists describe it as one of the five basic elements, the Mahabhutas (q.v.) and the Vaiseshikas (q.v.) considered it as one of the nine dravyas, substances, having the substratum of the quality of sound. Indra rules over Akasha. The Buddhists describe it as a state in cosmogenetic evolution. The Southern Buddhists made it one of the three eternal components of existence, the other two being law and Nirvana. Blavatsky considers space and universe to be synonymous. In space there is neither matter, nor space, nor spirit, not all that and much more. She states it to be the root of life which, in its eternal, ceaseless motion, like the out- and in breathing of one boundless ocean, evolves but to re-absorb all that lives and feels and thinks and has its being in it. (SD. V. pp. 381-82) The occultists consider Akasha as the astral and sidereal light (q.v.) which contains within its shoeless waves not only promise and potency of every quality of life but also realization of the potency of every quality of spirit. It is anima mundi (q.v.), the world soul, the workshop of nature and of all the cosmos, spiritually and physically. AKASHIYA DHRUVA :Celestial pole. AKASHIYA VISHUWATA VRITA :Celestial equator. AKHAND SAMRAJYA YOGA :A planetary combination producing a long life of affluence formed by Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius or Taurus as ascendant, making Jupiter rule either the 5th or the 11th house in a natal chart. The yoga also assumes that the rulers of the 2nd, 9th and 11th houses from the Moon are strong. AKRITI YOGA :Depending upon the pattern of relationships, the following yogas are identified as Akriti yoga:(1) Gada, (2) Saket, (3) Pakshin, (4) Bajra, (5) Yava, (6) Shringataka, (7) Hala, (8) Kamal, (9) Vapi, (10) Yupe, (11) Shar, (12) Shakti, (13) Dand, (14) Nau, (15) Kuta, (16) Chatra, (17) Ardha Chandra, (18) Chap, (19) Samudra, and (20) Chara. (For results of these yogas, see them under their respective names.) AKSHANSHA :Latitude. ALAYA :Meaning a dwelling place, a receptacle. The universal soul. The name belongs to the Tibetan system of the contemplative Mahayana school. Identical with Akasha (q.v.) in its mystic sense, and with Mool Prakriti (q.v.) in its essence, it is the basis of all things. Blavatsky considers Alaya as the soul of the world, or anima mundi (q.v.), which, according to esoteric teachings, changes its nature periodically. Alaya, though eternal and changeless in its inner essence on the planes which are unreachable by either men or cosmic gods, changes during the active life period with respect to the lower planes. The Mahayana school considers it as the personification of Void ness. Yet Alaya is the basis of every visible and invisible thing, though it is eternal and immutable in its essence, it reflects itself in every object of the Universe. ALPAYU :Short span of life. Those who die young. The exact duration of this short span depend upon the life expectancy prevalent in the culture of the native under consideration. As a general rule, the period of Alpayu extends up to 32 years of age. (For determination of longevity in any chart, see author's Planets in Signs and Houses. AMAR YOGA :An auspicious planetary combination formed in two ways, viz., (1) all cardinal houses occupied by all malefic, or by all benefices. In the former case, the native owns landed property and real estate, and in the latter case, he becomes rich and affluent; (2) Sun in Aries or in Leo occupies the ascendant, or any other cardinal or trine house while Moon is in exaltation or in its own sign, i.e., in Cancer or Taurus, and Jupiter and Venus occupy the 8th or 12th house in the natal chart. Amar yoga nullifies all evils in the horoscope. AMARAK YOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lord of the 7th house placed in the 9th house, and the lord of the 9th in the 7th house while both these planets are in"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 157strength. It bestows to the native long arms, big eyes, knowledge of law and religious scriptures. His wife is faithful to him and he leads a pure and moral life. AMARESHWARA :Lord of the immortals. A title of Vishnu, Shiva, and Indra. The name of one of the 12 great Lingas (q.v.) situated at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh. AMATYA KARAKA :The planet with the highest longitude in a natal chart, irrespective of the sign in which it- is placed is known as Atma karaka while the planet with the second highest longitude is known as Amatya karaka. It is related with the welfare of siblings. (See Karakattwa) AMAVASYA :New Moon day. AMBA :Mother. A name of Durga. The eldest daughter of a king of Kashi (Varanasi), she became in a subsequent birth a chieftain of the Pandavas and incapacitated Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kuru dynasty. (See Mahabharata) Amba is also the name of the eldest of the seven Pleiades, the heavenly sisters, each of whom was married to the seven sages of the constellation Great Bear. AMBIKA :A sister of Rudra. In later times identified as Uma or Parvati, the consort of Shiva. Also the name of a younger sister of Amba who became the mother of Dhritarashtra, of the Kuru dynasty. AMITABHA :[(A = not) + (mita = measurable) + (abha = splendour)]. Also a Chinese perversion of the Sanskrit Amrita Buddha meaning the Immortal Enlightened, which is a name of Gautam Buddha. The name has many variations such as Amita, Abida, Amitya, etc., meaning both 'Boundless Age' as well as 'Boundless Light.' The word is an anthropomorphised version of the original concept of the ideal of an impersonal divine light. Presently, it refers to one of the seven Adi Buddhas who is the heavenly prototype particularly of Gautarn Buddha. AMRITA :[(A = not) + (mrita = dead)] Nectar of immortality; ambrosia. Esoterically a state of interminable bliss; esoterically, it is the water of life, ambrosia, which, when taken, could lead to final beatitude. Also means the various things offered in sacrifice and more specially Soma. In the Vedas, ghritam, clarified butter, Soma, the sacred drink, and amritam, ambrosia, each attributed a distinct psychological state. The experience of the final beatitude leads to radical transformation, from which no retreat to uncertainty (and ignorance, avidya) is possible. In Puranic stories, the ambrosial drink was produced during the churning of the ocean by the gods and demons. The gods tried to prevent the demons from partaking of the drink but Rahu and Ketu (q.v.), represented by Vasuki, who had served as the churning cord, surreptitiously partook some of it and became immortal. AMSAVATARA YOGA :The planetary combination suggesting descent of an exalted is being into the body of an apparently simple person. It signifies limitations imposed on the incarnating ego, even after it attained high spiritual status. The yoga produces high status with fruits of spiritual and mundane achievements. (See Avatara Yoga) ANAGAMIN :[(An = not) + (gamin = subject to return)]. Not subject to return. Buddhist term for third-degree initiation. ANAGAMIN :The Dragon's Head, Rahu the invisible karmic planet. ANANT SHESHA :[(Anant = infinite, inexhaustible) + (Shesha = end)]. The Serpent of Eternity, represented by the thousand-headed serpent, said to function as the couch of Vishnu. It is also said to support the world on its nose. ANAPHA YOGA :A planet other than the Sun occupying the 12th house from the Moon constitutes Anapha yoga. Mars in this position makes the person powerful, self-controlled and a leader of persons engaged in undesirable activities. Mercury makes him proficient in oratory, an absorbing conversations, and skilled in social arts. Jupiter makes the native a serious-minded, righteous person spending money on charity. Venus makes the person a womanizer yet respected by persons in authority. Saturn leads to disenchantment, and the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 158nodes, to perversity. The Moon under the yoga bestows well-formed organs, good manners and self-respect. In old age, the individual becomes austere and renounces social involvement. ANGIRAS :A Vedic sage, Many hymns of the Rig Veda are attributed to him. All Rishis accorded him high status. He is included as one of the seven Maharishis, one of the ten Prajapatis, and a frequent companion of Indra. The name Angiras comes from, the same root as Agni, fire; many of his functions are associated with fire. Angiras inspires the lawgivers, is an author on astronomy, and is often considered a personification of Brihaspati, the regent of the planet Jupiter, or the planet itself. Angiras is also considered an epithet for the father of Agni. He is connected with hymns addressed to Agni, Indra and other luminous deities. One version makes him the son of Uru by Agneyi, the daughter of Agni; another makes him born from the mouth of Brahma. Even Daksha Prajapati is sometimes mentioned as his father. His wives are Smriti (memory), Shradha (reverence), Swaha (oblation), and Sad (truth). His daughters were Richas (Vedic hymns). His sons were the Manes called Havishmats. Utathya, Brihaspati, and Markandeya were also said to be his sons. Aurobindo ascribes to Angiras the role of the revealer of divine enlightenment. He considered Angiras to be in the first place a power of Agni, the Seer-Will. According to him, Angiras is also the seer, who works by light, by knowledge; he is a flame of the puissance of Agni, the great force that is born into the world to be the priest of sacrifices, and leader of the journey, the puissance which the gods are said to establish here as the immortal in mortals, the energy that does the great work. In the second place, Angiras is the power or at least has the power of Brihaspati, the truth-thinking and seven-rayed whose seven rays of light hold that truth which he thinks, and whose seven mouths repeat, is the word that expresses the truth. It cannot be doubted, Aurobindo says, that this host of troops of Brihaspati is meant to be the Angiras rishis, who by the true mantra help in the great victory. He even identifies Jupiter with Sage Angiras. Brihaspati is also an Angiras and one who becomes the Angiras-(SoV, pp. 152-65) ANGIRASAS :A generic name for several Puranic individuals, a class of Pitris (q.v.). The word also stands for a river in Plaksha, one of the seven sacred islands in Sapta Dwipa described- in detail in Devi Bhagwatam. Blavatsky mentions the Angirasas as an intermediate race of higher beings between gods and men. She states Angirasas to be one of the names of Dhyanis, or Deva instructors, of the late third, fourth and even of the fifth race initiates. (SD. IV. 177) ANGLES :Also known as Kendras, cardinal houses or the quadrants. The angles are very auspicious. All planets in these houses bestow affluence and happiness and active life. Even a malefic gives good results in the angles. ANIMA MUNDI :Latin for Alaya (q.v.). The soul of the world. The divine essence, which permeates, animates and informs all, from the smallest atom of matter to man and God. Every human soul is, according to Blavatsky, born by detaching itself from the anima mundi, which esoterically means that our higher egos are of an essence identical with that which is a radiation of the ever-unknown universal absolute. ANIVAHUPPU :A combination for planetary strength and its auspicious disposition given in Kapil Nadi Grantham. It refers to the strength of a planet arising from its placement in such a way that the remaining eight planets are distributed 4 in 6 houses on its both sides. The nodes are included among the planets considered under this combination. The central planet thus situated attains a powerful position. Even if it is not auspicious otherwise, this position enables it to produce beneficial results. ANTAHKARAN :[(Antar = middle, interior) + (Karan = cause, instrument)]. The bridge between the lower and the higher mind; the link between the Divine ego and the personal"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 159self of the man.

ANUJANMAN :Younger brother. ANULOMA :Born of a mother whose caste is inferior to that of the father. Viloma refers to the birth when the mother is superior in caste to that of the father. ANURADHA :17th asterism extending from 2130 20' to 2260 40' of the zodiac. Tamas (q.v.) is its primary attribute. Its presiding deity is Mitra (q.v.) and lotus is its symbol. It imparts the impulse of growth towards spirituality as well as materialism, depending upon the inherent nature of the individual. ANYONYASTAYA :Same as Parivartan (q.v.). APACHAYA :The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th and 8th houses in a natal chart. (See also Upachaya and Panphara houses) APASAVYA :A term used in Kalachakra (q.v.) Dasa calculation. Apasavya and Savya sequences are used to determine planetary relationships over different times in one's life. APOKLIMA :The 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th houses in a natal chart. Planets attain 1/4 of their basic strength in these houses. Preponderance of planets in them makes the latter part of an individual's life brighter and more active. APSARAS :Celebrated nymphs of Indra's heaven. Literally the word means ‘moving in the water’; these nymphs are said to have emerged as a result of the churning of the ocean and are very fond of water sports. They are able to change their forms and are very liberal in granting their favours. At Indra's instance, they often detract the sages from their austerities, specially when Indra feels his throne threatened. They are denizens of Anatariksha (q.v.). AQUARIUS :Meaning kumbha (sk) (a pitcher). The eleventh sign of the zodiac which extends from 3000 to 3300. Aquarius is airy and fierce, related to the western direction and is a Sudra by caste. It is powerful in day and likes to wander in forests. It produces struggles for earnest spiritual individuals but for a common householder it leads to inauspicious results, making his everyday life very hard. Saturn is its ruler. The sign does not provide suitable milieu for exaltation or debilitation of any planet. Aquarius represents the release of the universal life force latent in an individual. It increases and intensifies material propensities. Under its impulse, frustration is greatly heightened if the individual does not have indifference to worldly attainments. (For details, see REA, pp. 123-31; MSVA, pp. 159-61) ARA SAURIKARSHANA :Mutual aspect between Saturn and Mars ARA SAURI YOGA :Planetary combination between Saturn and Mars. It produces serious afflictions. ARDHA-CHANDRA YOGA :A planetary combination under which all planets occupy consecutive houses leaving the intervening cardinal houses vacant. The individual under this combination is happy, handsome, and is provided with much ornaments, gems and jewels. ARDHA-NARISHWARA :[(Ardha = half) + (nari = female) + Ushwara = God)]. A concept suggesting polarization of primeval unity into active (male) and passive (female) energy forms and their mutual interaction in togetherness. This stage of cosmic manifestation is described in many ways in ancient religious literature. Mahadeva, the Supreme Lord, also known as Shiva (q.v.), is represented as half male and half female, denoting masculine and feminine energies to be functioning together. The Puranic stories refer to Brahma, as splitting himself into Brahma-Viraj (male) and Vach-Viraj (female) whose mutual interaction began human generation. Swastika represents the union of male and female I"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 160together in action producing motion. Sankhya philosophy postulates Purusha (Spirit) and Prakriti (Nature) together, resulting in over lasting manifestation in action. The cosmic evolution from the primeval subjective state to the gross terrestrial manifestation results from the inter-action of polarized energy forms represented as Ardhanarishwara. It is analogous to Jungian psychology of balanced personality; i.e., a harmonious blending of male and female principles in an individual. Astrologically, the zodiacal belt is divided between male and female signs [as under Hora (q.v.) division]. Planets are also paired together, such as Sun-Moon, Mars-Saturn and Venus-Jupiter, while Mercury is the interconnecting link between subjective and objective groups of planets. ARDHAPRAHARA :An invisible satellite of Mercury. It is theoretically worked out as follows: Assuming the duration of a day is 30 ghatis (q.v.), Ardhaprahara rises after 14 ghatis on Sunday, 10 ghatis on Monday, 6 on Tuesday, 2 on Wednesday, 26 on Thursday, 22 on Friday, and 18 ghatis on Saturday. This period is proportionately changed if the duration of daytime differs. During nighttime, this satellite rises after 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 6, and 2 ghatis, respectively, on these days. ARGALA :Meaning a latch, a bar, or a bolt used for fastening a door or the cover of a vessel. Figuratively, it refers to some-thing intervening as an obstruction. In Jaimini astrology (q.v.), it is used to describe the obstructing effect of an intervening planet. It assumes that planets and signs of the zodiac affect other planets and signs by their aspects. These influences can be nullified by the presence of certain planets at certain places relative to these planets and signs. Such obstructing planets are known as Argalas. ARGHA :Respectable oblation to a god. A small boat-shaped vessel often used for an oblation of water. In mystic literature, the word is also used for the Ark or the womb of nature, the crescent moon, or a life-saving ship. ARHAT :The worthy one deserving divine honors. A title given to fourth degree initiates\" who have attained Nirvana (q.v.). An Arhat is one who has entered the highest path (of return) and is emancipated from the bondage of involuntary rebirth. ARIDRA :Meaning green, fresh, soft, moist. The 6th asterism extending from 660 44’ to 800 00' of the zodiac. Its presiding deity is Rudra, the planetary ruler is Rahu and its primary motivation comes from Kama, passion. Its basic attribute is Rajas (q.v.). It is symbolized by a human head. The asterism represents the thinking capacity in man. ARIES :The zodiacal sign extending from 00 00' to 300 00\" of the zodiac. Mars rules over the sign, the Sun is exalted at 100 and Saturn is debilitated at 200. Aries is considered male by sex, a quadruped by species, and blood red in color. Its other characteristics are moving, fiery, barren or very few children, bilious in bodily humor, austere and sullied in appearance, rises from the hind part. Its abode is the surface of the earth containing precious stones and gems; it rules over minerals. The sign represents the first stirrings of cosmic ideation. It stands for the beginning of every creative impulse. In Vedantic philosophy, Aries stands for initial action, or Avarana Shakti, the veiling process. Its impulse is unsullied, noumenal in its original innocence containing within it all forms of evolutionary potential. Aries is primordial dynamic energy, the eternal fire inherent in every form of creation in its latency. It is capable of acting in destructive as well as constructive manner. It shows the primeval polarization of cosmic unity. The Puranic stories describe Brahma, the cosmic creator, born under this sign. Aries imparts activity, eagerness to venture in new directions and undertake new explorations, experience happiness in creative activities and take greater interest in action than in results. The sign is supremely suited for asceticism, yogic practices and austerities. It arouses great urge for renunciation of material wealth. It exerts strong spiritual influence and often"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 161inspires the persons born under the sign to enter into religious discipleship. These persons are well meaning in their intentions, yet are extremely difficult to live with. Their social relationships are boorish, their married life strained, and professional career rough. Aries-born individuals are never satisfied. They desire to reach insurmountable peaks and feel independent. The sign produces radical changes and makes social behavior unpredictable. Aries produces too many contradictions in life. Syn: Mesha (ram.), Vishwa (the universe), Kriya (physical action), Tamboor (a kind of musical instrument), Adyam (beginning), Vasta (goat, an abode), Pratham (primeval), Kshetram (sacred spot), Riksha (bear), Bhavam (an abode), Bha (delusion). ARISTHAM :Meaning misfortune; unlucky omen. A planetary combination that produces unfavourable results and obstructs the fructification of auspicious ones. It accentuates illness, poverty, fatal accidents, and may even cause death. ARISTHA BHANGA :Mitigation of unfavorable results expected by Aristha Yogas (q.v.). Three such alleviating combinations are (a) Mercury, Jupiter or Venus in a quadrant; (b) a strong Jupiter in ascendant, and (c) a strong ascendant lord in a cardinal house. ARISTHA YOGAS:Planetary combinations producing misfortune. These combinations nullify auspicious results and produce hardships. Some of these combinations are listed below: (i) Malefic (q.v.) associated with the 6th, 8th and 12th houses or their lords; (ii) Malefic aspects on a weak Moon; (iii) Sun, Mars, and Saturn in the 5th house; (iv) Mars, Saturn, or Sun in the 8th house; (v) malefic aspect on weak ascendant lord, Sun or at Moon; (vi) Sun, Mars, Rahu and Saturn in ascendant; (vii) exchange of signs between Jupiter and Mars; (viii) Mars and Saturn in the 2nd house while Rahu occupies the 3rd; (ix) Rahu in the 4th, and Moon in the 6th or 8th house; W Mars in the 7th, Venus in the 8th and Sun in the 9th house; (xi) Malefic in the 7th and 12th houses; (xii) Jupiter, Sun, Rahu and Mars occupy signs of malefic Planets while Venus is in the 7th house; (xiii) lord of ascendant associated with a malefic or flanked by two malefic, and a malefic positioned in the 7th house (it produces suicidal tendencies); (xiv) Saturn in the 8th house, Moon in ascendant, or alter-natively, Venus and Moon in the 6th or 8th House (it leads to stomach disorder or maimed limbs); and (xv) Moon and Mercury in the 6th or 8th house. ARJUNA :Meaning white, the bright or silvery color. The third Pandu Prince born, supposedly, of the radiance of Indra, hence he is also called Aindra, meaning, born of Indra. Arjuna was brave as the bravest, a highly skilled archer, proficient musician, aristocratic in temperament, generous, tenderhearted, and chivalrous. His extraordinary skill in archery has identified him with the astrological sign of Sagittarius. He was taught military science by Dronacharya, the greatest teacher of ethics, royal manners, as well as in military science during the Mahabharata period. Arjuna won Draupadi, a daughter of the Panchal king Draupada, in an archery contest and thus married her at her swayamvar.* Fraternal feud led to Arjuna's exile and during this period, he received further instructions in the use of arms from Parasurama, the sixth avatara (q.v.) of Vishnu. During the period of exile, he married Ulupi, a Naga princess and by her he had a son named Iravat. He also married Chitrangada, a daughter of the king of Manipur, and from her he had a son named Babruvahan. He visited Krishna at Dwaraka and there he married Subhadra, the sister of Krishna. By her he had a son, named Abhimanyu. Later on, he obtained the bow 'Gandiva' from Agni (q.v.). He journeyed to the heavenly world, where he, on resisting the advances of Urvashi, the most beautiful celestial nymph, was cursed with (temporary) impotence. When his eldest brother, Yudhishthir, lost the kingdom in gambling, the five brothers went into exile for 13 years, including a year of incognito residence. During this period, Arjuna went on a pilgrimage to the Himalayas to propitiate gods and to obtain from them celestial weapons for use in the anticipated war against the Kauravas. On this occasion, he fought with Shiva (q.v.) who appeared before him in the guise of a mountaineer, but Arjuna having"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 162found out the true character of his adversary, worshipped him, and obtained from him the Pashupata, one of the most powerful weapons. Indra carried Arjuna to his capital Amaravati where Arjuna spent some time improving his military skill and use of weapons. At the instance of Indra, he went to fight against the daityas (q.v.) of the sea and vanquished them. On his return, Indra presented him 'with a chain of gold and diadem and with a war shell, which sounded like thunder.' During the thirteenth year of exile, when he was expected to live incognito, he entered into the service of the king Virata, disguised as a eunuch (the nemesis of Urvasi's curse), and acted as a music teacher to Virata's daughter Uttara. Towards the concluding period of his incognito residence, he took a leading part in an assault on the side of King Virata and defeated his enemies, thus winning the lasting friendship of the king, which proved very useful in the course of his fight with the Kauravas. When the Kauravas, at the end of the Pandavas' exile, refused to return their kingdom, preparations for the Mahabharata war began and Arjuna secured the personal assistance of Lord Krishna as his charioteer. Before the actual battle began, Arjuna became despondent at the futility of the impending bloodshed. Krishna, then, related the famous Shrimad Bhagvada Gita to Arjuna in the battlefield in the presence of both the armies of Kauravas and the Pandavas. The Mahabharata war lasted 18 days. On the tenth day, Arjuna wounded Bhishma mortally. He killed many of his adversaries, including Jayadratha and others. On the seventeenth day, he was stung by some reproaches of his eldest brother Yudhishthir and he would have killed him had not Krishna interposed; on the same day he miraculously escaped being killed by Karna (Arjuna's mother's son from the Sun-god before her marriage to his father Pandu) but an accident to Karna's chariot gave Arjuna the opportunity of killing him. After the victory following Yudhishthir's Ashwamedha horse, Arjuna, besides fighting and conquering many kings, also had an encounter with his own son Babhruvahana at the city of Manipur; there he was killed by his son but was restored to life by a Naga-charm supplied by his wife Ulupi. Arjuna was subsequently called to Dwaraka amid the internecine struggles of the Yadavas, the descendants of Krishna. There Arjuna performed the funeral rites of Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, and of Krishna himself. While he was escorting the wives of Krishna to their abode, he was humiliated and defeated by wayside marauders, which proved to be not only a great disappointment for him but also an eye-opener. He realized that all his powers, which were given to him by Lord Krishna, no longer existed after Lord Krishna's death. He was now a commonplace entity. Soon afterwards, he retired from the world to the Himalayas, where he perished in the snow along with his brothers and Draupadi. (*Swayamvar is an ancient ceremony where marriageable maidens, brides-to-be, stipulated certain conditions, and any individual who could fulfill and accomplish them, could marry the girl as a result.) ARKA :Meaning, a ray of light, a flash of lightning. Sun; Sunday. ARTHA :Meaning, to strive, obtain, desire. The word means 'significance' specially of attaining worldly objects, such as riches, prosperity, etc. Artha is also one of the four ends of human life, the other three being Dharma (righteousness), Kama (passion, sexual urge, intense attachment), and Moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths, Nirvana (q.v.), release). Artha is the primary motivational impulse of Bharani, Punarvasu, Makkha, Swati, Jyestha, Shravana and Purva Bhadrapada asterisms. ARUDHA :Ascended. (See Arudha Lagna) ARUDHALAGNA :Arudha refers to the relative distance of a sign as the lord of the sign is from the sign it owns. Arudha lagna is also known as Pada lagna, a term frequently used in Jaimini astrology. It is worked out by counting the same number of signs from the ascendant lord as it (the ascendant lord) is from the ascendant. For example, if the ascendant is Leo and the Sun is placed in Scorpio, four houses away from the ascendant"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 163sign Leo, Arudha lagna will be four houses away from Scorpio where the Sun is placed. In this case Arudha lagna will be Aquarius. ARUNA :Rosy red, the morning hue; the color of dawn. The dawn is personified as the charioteer of the Sun. While driving the chariot, Aruna sits facing the Sun rather than the horses. Aruna is of a later origin than the Vedic Usha. He is said to be a son of the Sage Kashyapa and Kadru. ARYA VASU :One of the 7 rays of the Sun which, according to the Kurma Purana, nourishes Jupiter. ARYAMAN :The presiding deity over the twelfth asterism, Uttara Phalguni. A Vedic deity whose interaction with Varuna, Mitra, and Bhaga enables a seeker to reach one indivisible light. Before a human being attains this position, he needs mighty strength, perfectly guided happy inner upsurgings, and constant endurance to reach his goal. Aryaman has the function of strengthening the endurance of the seeker. In all human endeavors, there is stress and strain of efforts, there is struggle. The resolution of conflicts on the path enables the individual to transcend narrowness (an aspect of Varuna) and establish harmony (Mitra). It requires intense austerity, penance, and mastery' over one's psychic reactions. It is through Aryaman's guidance and assistance that success in efforts is accomplished. Aryaman is the embodiment of endurance. The physical body, i.e., the jar, requires thorough baking before the nectar of immortality can be poured in it. This baking is done by the heat and austerity of Aryaman. Aurobindo states that Aryaman sums up in himself the whole aspiration and movement of man in continual self-enlargement and self-transcendence to his divine perfection. Dowson considers Aryaman as 'a bosom friend'. According to him, Aryaman appears in religious literature as the chief of the Pitris (q.v.); one of the Adityas, and one of the Vishwadevas. The Puranic stories make him to be an offspring of Aditi (q.v.). ARYA SIDDHANTA :The system of astronomy founded by Aryabhatta in his work bearing his name. Aryabhatta is considered as the inventor of algebra; two of his works, viz., the Dasagiti Sutra and Aryashtasata published now under the title Aryabhattiya were extensively known throughout the contemporary world. Aryabhatta was born at Kusumapura (Patna) in A.D. 476, and his first astronomical work was composed at the age of twenty-three. ARYAVARTA :The land of the Aryans, synonymous with India. But more specifically it is the tract of land between the Himalayas and the Vindhya range and from the eastern to the western seas. ASAT :[(a = non) + (sat = truth; the immutable, eternal, the one real banes)]. A metaphysical concept referring to 'non-being' rather ‘nonbe- ness'; the incomprehensible nothing-ness. A synonym of matter, Prakriti (q.v.). The unreal or the objective nature is regarded as illusion, nature, or the illusive shadow of its one-true-essence. ASCENDANT :Lagnam (sk.). Meaning, an auspicious moment; decisive moment; time of action. The point on ecliptic (q.v.) rising at the eastern horizon at the time of birth or occurrence of an event. The zodiacal sign at the time of birth. In a horoscope, an ascendant represents general personality, opportunities in life, and the basic impulse motivating the individual. It indicates the physical appearance, general health, early years of one's life and the inborn vitality with which the individual meets life's challenges. Jaimini astrology considers 6 kinds of ascendants, viz., Arudha or Pada; Bhava; Hora; Varnada; Ghatika; and Nisheka. All these are worked out differently and are intended to describe different aspects of the individual. ASCENDANTS, TABLE OF :A table giving longitudes of different zodiacal signs rising at the ascendant corresponding to each sidereal time (q.v.)."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 164ASCENSION, RIGHT :Visuvamsa (sk). A coordinate to locate a celestial body. It represents the arc of the celestial equator (q.v.) measured eastward from the vernal equinox to the foot of the great circle passing through the celestial poles and the given object on the celestial sphere expressed in degrees, hours, etc. ASHADA, PURVA :The 20th asterism extending from 2520 20' to 2660 40' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Venus, its presiding deity is Aapas, the water god, and its primary attribute is Sattwa (q.v.) and the basic motivation comes from Moksha, liberation. It is considered Brahmin by caste, monkey by species, man by temperament. It represents the eastern direction. It is an auspicious asterism producing God's grace, pride and suitable conditions for spiritual growth. (See also MSK pp. 229-31.) ASHADA, UTTARA :The 21st asterism, which extends from 2660 40' to 2800 00' of the zodiac, is an extension of the previous one, viz., Purva Ashada, and both together form the complete unit, yet there are subtle differences between them. Uttara Ashada is ruled by Sun, and Vishwadeva is its Vedic deity. Its primary attribute is Sattwa, and basic motivational impulse is also Moksha, liberation (the same as the previous asterism). It is, however, categorized as a warrior by caste, mongoose by species, but man (the same as the earlier one) by temperament. It represents the southern direction. It is a spiritualizing influence: it arouses humility, self-centeredness and deep-rooted sensitivity to cosmic unity. (See MSVA, pp. 232-34) ASHLESHA :The 9th asterism containing 5 stars symbolizing a serpent extends from 1060 40' to 1200 00' of the zodiac. It is one of the most mysterious asterisms capable of imparting highly spiritualizing influence as well as the most depraved mentality. The asterism is ruled by Mercury. Its presiding deity are the Nagas (q.v.), the serpent custodians of spiritual wisdom. Its primary attribute is Rajas (q.v.) and the basic impulse is spiritual magnetism. As the Moon is related to human psyche and the changes within it, and Mercury is concerned with intelligence, so are these planets closely related with this asterism; they endow it with great potential for mental development. Ashlesha imparts intellectual and mental development enabling those whom it affects to very much change their perception of life. These changes occur in the most unexpected ways which make the individual experience radical transformation in its thinking and relationships. ASHUBHA :Meaning Krura, cruel, or a malefic planet such as Saturn and Rahu. ASHRAM :Hermitage of a sage, or a monastery for ascetic contemplation. One of the four stages in the life of an individ-ual as divided under the law of Manu, specially so in the case of a Brahman. These four ashrams or stages are (i) Brahmacharya, when the individual spends his time as a student under a spiritual preceptor, (ii) Grihastha, in which he is married and spends the life of a householder, (iii) Vanaprastha, the anchoret or the dweller of the woods who, having discharged his duties as 'a man of the world', retires to the forest to devote himself to self-denial and religious meditation, and (iv) Sanyasa, the religious mendicant who wanders about and lives with complete indifference to the mundane world and intent upon humanitarian work and final absorption, Moksha. ASHWIN/ASHWINAU/ ASHWINI KUMAR The 1st asterism extending over 130 20' of the zodiac. It is related with the Sun in many ways: the two ascetics represented by the asterism are said to be born of the Sun and his estranged wife Tvastri, when they had assumed the form of a horse and a mare. The various appellations, e.g., Abdijan (ocean-born), Pushakara-srajan (wreathed with lotus), Badav-eyan (sons of the submarine fire) indicate their mystic character. The Ashwini Kumars are said to be born of the Sun and the sky and are known as Dasra (the destroyer) and Nasatya (untruth). They are drawn in a three-wheeled chariot and the charioteer's seat is -divided in three sections. In the Vedas, they are described as two deities, very young and handsome in appearance, bright and of golden brilliance, agile, swift as falcons, possessed of many forms, riding in a golden car drawn by horses or birds, as"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 165harbingers of Usha, dawn. They are the earliest bringers of light in the morning sky. They are hymned as the physicians of heaven who restored the sage Chyavan to youth and had prolonged his life when he had become old and decrepit. In the Mahabharata, they are described as the parents of the Pandu princes, Nakula and Sahadeva. Ashwins, as an asterism, consisting of 3 stars, are symbolised in the form of a horse. The zodiacal sign Aries in which it occurs, is ruled by Mars but the asterism itself is ruled by Ketu. Its presiding deities are the two Ashwini Kumars. Its primary attribute is Rajas, and its basic motivating impulse is Dhanna, righteousness. It is classified as a merchant by caste, horse by species, and a god by temperament. It represents the south direction. The asterism imparts regenerative potential, leadership and 'thirst for sensation. The Sun is exalted in this asterism. Blavatsky sums up the characteristic of the Aswinis -by describing them as the two Vedic deities, the twin sons of the Sun and the sky, the bright harbingers of the dawn, who prepare the way for the brilliant dawn for those who patiently wait through the night. They are the physicians of the heaven world inasmuch as they heal every pain and suffering and cure all diseases. They are the ocean-born, or Abdijan, crowned with lotuses. The Aswinis represent the transition from darkness to light, cosmically and metaphysically. ASPECT :Meaning Drishti (sk), sight. Transference of planetary influences to another planet or house division as a result of their situation in relation to each other. Every planet casts direct aspect on planets located seventh from itself. Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn possess additional aspects, too. Jupiter aspects 5th and 9th additionally; Mars aspects 4th as well as 8th; and Saturn aspects 3rd and 10th besides their usual 7th aspect. These are full aspects; planets have three-quarters, half and a quarter aspects, too. These determine the strength of the impulse produced by their location. Full aspect produces 100 per cent result, three-quarters 75 per cent and a quarter aspect produces only 25 per cent of the inherent results of the planet aspecting. Usually the aspects cover the entire house division on which the planet casts its aspect, yet the concentrated impact is restricted to a narrow range which differs for different planets. The range of concentration is known as Deeptamsa which is ±100 for the Sun; - ± 50 for Moon; ± 30 30' for Mercury; ±30 for Venus; ±40 for mars, ±40 30' for Jupiter and ±40 30' for Saturn. Nodes do not have any aspect but some authorities assign them full aspect on the 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th houses, 3/4 aspect on 2nd , and 10th and 1/2 aspect on 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th houses. Table 1 shows aspects of various planets. Jaimini astrology considers aspects based on the relationship between different signs. Planets located in any sign acquire the aspect assigned to them. ASSOCIATION :A relationship produced by the position of two or more planets in the same sign or house. (Also see Asthamana.) Aspects of Different Planets Planets Deeptamsa (+) or (-) Full Aspect 100% Three- Quarters 75% Half 50%One- Quarter 25% Sun 100  7 4,8 9,5 10,3 Moon 50 7 4,8 9,5 10,3 Mercury 30 30' 7 4,8 9,5 10,3 Venus 30 7 4,8 9,5 10,3 Mars 40 4,7,8 Nil 9,5 10,3"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 166 Jupiter 40 30' 5,7,9 4,8 Nil 10,3 Saturn 40 30' 3,7,10 4,8 9,5 Nil ASHTAKAVARGA :Meaning eightfold categorization. It depicts eightfold strength of planets excluding the nodes of the Moon but including the ascendant. It is worked out according to certain well-established rules for measuring the planetary strength. The strength of each planet depends upon the location of other planets and the ascendant in relation to it. Eight full points are assigned to each planet. They can obtain strength varying from zero to 8 points which, plotted on different signs in a chart, determine the possibility of a transiting planet in inducing auspicious or otherwise effects during its sojourn in a particular sign. Four or more benefic points lead to the fructification of benefic results and elimination of any malefic effect of the planet's transit in that sign. ASTERISMS :Also known as Nakshatras (sk) and lunar mansions. A portion of the zodiacal circle of 3600, beginning with 0' Off of fixed signs (q.v.) divided into 27 divisions, each of which division measures 130 20', represents one asterism, or Nakshatra. An additional asterism, viz., Abhijit, is sometimes added in between the 21st and 22nd ones, which alters the magnitude of some of these asterisms. The asterisms are powerful centers of radiation. Moon has special relationship with them. Its position in an asterism determines the ruler ship of planets over different periods in an individual's life. (See Dasa system) ASHTA DISHA :Kashta = eight) + (disha = direction)]. Eight cardinal points; the eight-faced ASTHAM :Eighth position, either from a sign or a planet. Such positions are considered inauspicious. ASTHAMANA :Occultation or obscuration of a planet by the Sun. It is formed when a planet is hidden by the rays of the Sun. When other planets do the same, it is known as Samagama, meaning union or association. ASTIKA :One who believes in God. An ancient sage, son of Jarat-Karu by a sister of the great serpent Vasuki (q.v.). He saved the life of the serpent Takshaka, when Janamejaya sacrii-ficed the serpents. Astika induced the king to forego his persecution of the serpent race. ASTODAYA :Rasta = setting) + udaya = rising]. Helical setting and rising of a planet. ASTOTTRI :A system of Dasa calculation (q.v.). Only 8 planets, instead of 9 under the popular Vimshottri system (q.v.), are taken into consideration under it to qualify for a cycle of 108 years of total planetary ruler ship (as against 120 years under Vimshottri). Depending upon the position of the Moon in different blocks of 3-4 asterisms in which even Abhijit, which is not considered in other systems, is included, the initial ruler ship of a planet is decided. Table 3 indicates the order of precedence of the planets, years of their ruler ship and the blocks of asterisms in which the placement of Moon qualifies initial ruler ship of a planet. ASTRAL LIGHT :A concept similar to sidereal light of Paracelsus and other Hermetic philosophers. It has been popularised in modern times by occultists like H.P. Blavatsky, Eliphas Levy and others. Physically, it is the ether of modem science; metaphysically and in its spiritual sense, \"it encloses within its shoreless waves not only promise and potency of every quality of life, but also the realization of the potency of every quality of Spirit.\" Blavatsky describes it as a subtle essence visible only to a clairvoyant eye, and is the lowest but one of the seven Akashic or cosmic principles. Eliphas Levy calls it the Great Serpent and the Dragon from which radiates humanity on every evil influence.

It gave precise magnitudes, positions, motions, etc., of heavenly bodies based on their functioning over millennia. Their observation, if yogic methods of studying the stellar realm is included under it (See Patanjali Sutra, III. 27, 28 and 29), extended over innumerable yugas, manvantaras and kalpas. They fixed the calendar (both lunar and solar), described the zodiac and asterisms in great detail, calculated precisely the precession of the equinoxes, established the general laws of the stellar movements and observed and predicted the eclipses. They described the wobbling of the polar axis and even reported complete reversal of the poles. The earth was known to them as a sphere rotating on its axis and revolving round the Sun. Our world belonged to a heliocentric system, but the Sun derived its life essence from the Milky Way; it passed a portion of it to the Moon, which disseminated the same, according to its brighter and darker phases, nourished different kinds of entities and vegetation. The Sun was the ultimate dispenser of energy to the solar system, but it depended for its stability and existence on the Saptarishis, represented by the Ursa Minor. The ancient seers had detailed knowledge of visible and invisible satellites of different planets, extra-Saturnian planets, comets, nebulas, and galaxies connected with our solar system. The Puranic details of the stellar realm veiled much of the deeper knowledge of the heavenly world from the common readers, yet the available information in ancient Siddhantas displayed the accuracy of the ancient information. The ancient astronomical knowledge, as reflected in observances, prescribed for sacrificial rites (Yajnas), temple architecture and the location of temples, and the various astrological impulses exposed the seers' perception of supra-physical forces intimately related with the physical astronomical system. They gave these details so as to enable the human individual to work effectively for his self-development and self-transcendence with a view to attaining divine perfection. ASURA :[(i) (a = not) + (sura = god); (ii) (asu= breath) + (ra = to bestow)]. In the oldest parts of the Rig Veda, the term was used for the Supreme Spirit, the bestowed of beneficence to the world. As a benefic power, it was applied to several of the chief deities,"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 168e.g., Indra, Agni, and Varuna. In later times, the word acquired the opposite meaning and came to signify a demon or the enemy of gods. It was in this later sense that later Vedic and the still later Puranic periods applied the word to those who opposed divine and benefic powers. The churning of the ocean, samudramanthan, in which the gods and the demons took opposite sides, applied Pe word Asuras in the malefic sense. The Taittiriya Brahmana states that the breath (asu) of Prajapati (Brahma) became alive, and with that he created the Asuras. In another part of the same work, he is said to have become pregnant and thus he created Asuras from his abdomen. The Taittiriya Aranyaka represents Brahma as the creator of gods, men, Pitris, Gandharvas, and Apsaras from water, and that the Asuras, Rakshasas and Pisachas sprang from the drops, which were spilt. The various other scriptures also attribute a divine origin to Asuras. Blavatsky states that the word changed its meaning when ritualism and dogmatism got better of wisdom and the initial letter a was adopted as a negative prefix. It has now come to mean enemies of gods. Yet the Asuras cannot be outright condemned as unspiritual beings. There are many kinds of divine beings who are not necessarily gods. Many Daityas and Danavas and other descendants of sage Kashyapa from his several wives are opposed to gods, and at times usurped their kingdom, but they are not considered outright as devils. Rakshasas, who were the descendants of Sage Pulashya, belonged to a different category; their greatest weakness was greatly inflated egotism, which led them to much mischief and grief. In Vedic astrology, presently Asura stands for Rahu which represents impediments (analogous to the Vedic Vritras (q.v) arousing spirituality in the individual. ASWAMEDHA :The sacrifice of a horse. It was performed by kings. It implied that he who instituted it was a conqueror and king of kings. It did not entail the killing of a horse, but the horse was let loose to wander in different directions without any restraint; he who stopped the horse had to fight the king who had let it loose or to accept his suzerainty. It was believed that the performance of one hundred such sacrifices would enable a mortal king to ascend the throne of Indra, and to become the ruler of the universe and the sovereign of gods. ATALA :[(a = without) + (tala = surface, roof, bottom)]. Bottomless, unfathomable. One of the 7 islands or the lokas (q.v.) belonging to the nether world. Antipodes. One of the 14 realms of existence. Blavatsky states Atala loka to exist on the astral plane; it was once upon a time, according to her, a real island on the earth. ATICHARA :Accelerated motion of a planet, especially during its passage from one sign to another. Such an acceleration occurs after the planet's recovery from retrogression. ATMA/ATMAN :Meaning soul, Brahman, essence, the natural temperament. Atm refers to one's own Self; Atma to Self-awareness, and Atman to the state of being supremely aware. Atmajnana is Self-knowledge, or knowledge of the soul; Atmatattwa is the true nature of the spirit, and Atmavidya the wisdom of the Self or Divine Wisdom. The Vedas spoke of Atmanam atmane pasya, meaning see Thyself by thyself. The Supreme Self can be known by itself and any knowledge about it based on any other source is only illusory and deceptive. Atma alone is the one real and eternal substratum of all, the essence and absolute knowledge, the Kshetrajna (q.v.), the knower of the field. It is the central core of pure awareness; it neither forgets, nor remembers. It is the ever-present substratum of the consciousness of egoism, it witnesses the experiences of three stages of consciousness, viz., waking, dreaming and the dreamless slumber. It is different from the five sheaths, viz., physical, pranic, sensational, mental, and blissful. Atman perceives all but it is not perceived by others. It is like the eternal ray of light which shines upon and through the darkness of matter, when the latter is able to reflect the same, but light itself cannot be penetrated by anything else."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 169Atma's relationship with Jivatma and Paramatma refers to the relationship of the subjective, noumenal individual scintilla with the noumenal universal fire on the one hand and the same life essence enmeshed in matter on the other. fivatma, the individual soul, is enshrined in individ-ual sheaths to which it constantly imparts the urge for liberation while experiencing the materialisation process and the resulting thraldom. On achieving pure awareness, liberation, the individual consciousness merges in the universal conscious-ness, Paramatma. The philosophy of Vishistadvaita assigns a different status to Atman. When the individual has attained Moksha (q.v.), liberation, and the body dies at different levels of material existence, Jiva has already passed through several stages; on death, it goes with Sukshama Sharira, or the dreamlike illusive body, from the heart of the body to the Crown Chakra, Brahmarandra, located in the crown of the head, traversing the Sushumna Nadi, a nerve connecting the heart with the Crown Chakra. Jiva breaks through Brahmarandra and goes to the region of the Sun, Surya Mandal, or the aura of the Sun through the solar rays. Then it goes through a dark spot in the Sun to Paramapada, the source of Supreme Light. liva is directed on its passage by Atmajnana acquired by yogic discipline. Jiva thus proceeds to Paramapada with the assistance of Adhivahikas, the bearers in transit by various names, e.g., Archi, Ahas, Adityas, Prajapatis. On attaining Paramapada, the source of Supreme Light, the individual attains the awareness of himself as the emanating spark from the uncreated ray. Atma is then combined with the Universal Spirit and becomes a part of it, yet as Atma it retains its individual identity. The status attained at this level is that of Pratyeka Buddha, the individual enlightened being. The soul's journey proceeds further when this individual awareness completely loses its distinctive character and merges wholly in the Universal Spirit to become Atman, the Supreme Soul, Brahman. Currently, the word Atma or soul is used in many different senses. It is used as the word soul or anima mundi (q.v.), animal soul, spiritual soul, etc. These words merely refer to the central animating core of the being expressing itself through different sheaths at different levels of its existence. The relationship between Atma, Buddhi, and Manas is astrologically represented by the disposition of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury. ATMA KARAKA PLANET :The planet representing Atma; the Sun is the Karaka, dir the causative agent, of Atma. Atma Karaka planet in a horoscope is decided on the basis of the highest longitudinal progression of a planet, irrespective of the sign in which it is placed. The nodes of Moon in this reckoning due to their permanent retrogressional motion are counted from the end of the sign. In predictive astrology, Atma Karaka planet attains great importance; all other planets are expected to bestow their support to it. The harmony between natural Atma Karaka planet, the Sun, and the special Atma Karaka position attained by a planet represents the unity of purpose or otherwise between the permanent nature of the individual, his soul and the course earmarked for him in the present birth. ATREYA :A patronymic from Atri. A son or descendant of Atri (q.v.). ATRI :A Vedic sage is said to have composed many hymns in praise of Agni, Indra, the Ashwins and the Vishwa-Devas. He was also considered one of the ten Prajapatis assigned the task of human generation. He is described as a mind born son of Brahma, and one of the seven gages related with several Manus, e.g., Swayambhu, Swarochitha, and the Vaivasvata. According to the Puranic stories, when Brahma asked them to create the universe, he went into deep meditation for several thou-sands of years, at the termination of which a drop of water fell from his eyes which took the form of the sage; Soma, or the Moon was born from this sage and his wife Anasuya, one of the daughters of Daksha, and she was"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 170considered as one of the most pious ladies. Rama along with Sita and Lakshman visited Atri's hermitage during his exile from Ayodhya. AVADHUTA :An ascetic who has renounced all worldly attachments and connections. AVASTHA :Disposition of a planet. It is classified in 10 categories, viz., (i) Deeptha, illuminated or exalted; (ii) Swastha, healthy, owning its own sign, (iii) Mudita, joyous, owning a friendly sign; (iv) Shanthi, quiet, placed in auspicious subdivisions (v) Shakta, powerful, NO Vakra, in retrogression, (vii) Peedya, tormented, occupying the last quarter of a sign, (viii) Vikal, mutilated, when a planet is combust, (ix) Khala, mischievous when it is debilited, and (x) Ashubha, inauspicious, when the planet is in its atichara (q.v.) or accelerated motion. AVATARA :A descent. It refers to the descent of a deity, especially of Vishnu, or of some exalted being who has progressed beyond the necessity of involuntary reincarnations. These are of two kinds, viz., those -born from women, or appearing on the earth without any parent. The first indication, not of an avatara but of what subsequently developed into an avatara is found in the Rig Veda in the \"three steps of the unconquerable preserver who strode over this (universe) and in three places planted his steps\". This has been variously interpreted. The early commentators understood the three places to be the earth, the atmosphere and the sky; in the Earth, Vishnu was fire, in the air lightning and in the sky the solar light. Another sage interpreted it to mean the three positions of the Sun, viz., at its rising culmination, and as at setting. The most common 10 avataras, according to Puranic stories are: Matsya, fish; Kurma, tortoise; Varaha, boar; Narasimha, man-lion; Vamana, dwarf; Parasurama, Rama with an axe; Rama, the son of Dasharatha, the ideal king, Krishna, the Lord who functioned as the charioteer of Arjuna enlightened him about the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita; Buddha, the son of Suddhodhana who finally became the enlightened Sakyamuni; and Kalki, who will appear at the end of Kaliyuga. The Bhagavata Purana which greatly glorified the role of Vishnu enumerates 22 such incarnations: (1) Purusha, the male, the progenitor, (2) Varaha, the boar, (3) Narada, the great celestial musician, (4) Nara and Narayana, Vishnu floating on a serpent couch on the infinite water, (5) Kapila, the sage philosopher, (6) Dattatreya, the three-deities in one, (7) Yajna, the sacrifice, (8) Rishabha, the righteous king and father of Bharat, (9) Prithu, a king of the solar race, (10) Matsya, the fish, (11) Kurma, the tortoise, (12 & 13) Dhanwantri with nectar, the physi-cian of the gods and the drink of immortality, (14) Narasiniha, the man-Ijon, (15) Vamana, the dwarf, (16) Parasurama, the sage with axe, (17) Ved Vyasa, the compiler of the Vedas, (18) Rama, the king of Ayodhya, who killed Ravana, (19) Balarama, the elder brother of Krishna, (20) Buddha, and (22) Kalki. After this listing, the Purana however mentions that the avataras of Vishnu are innumerable. AVATARA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by (i) the ascendant occupying a cardinal Sign, i.e., Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn, and 00 Venus and Jupiter also in Angles, i.e., 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th houses, and (iii) Saturn in exaltation. The combination bestows spiritual blessings uplifting the individual's mind and heart enabling him to attain mystic awareness and inner wisdom. He becomes an erudite and deep student of religious and esoteric literature with psychic susceptibilities. The combination also bestows high status in society, renown for meritorious deeds and pilgrimages to religious and historical places. He shapes the character of the age in which he is born. AVAYOGA BINDU :See Yoga Bindu. AVIDYA :(Meaning ignorance, want of spiritual wisdom.) The Vedantic concept of illusion created by Maya (q.v.). Avidya makes an individual perceive the (unreal) phenomenal universe as real. The concept is based on the assertion that Brahma alone is Real and everything else is illusory. AYANA :The Sun's monthly speed."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 171AYANAMSA :The difference between the Tropical (Sayana) and the Sidereal (Nirayana) longitudes. The beginning of the zodiacal circle under Sidereal system is always the fixed 00 of Aries; the Tropical System assumes the point of intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic at Vernal Equinox when the Sun begins its journey in the northern hemisphere as the 00 of Aries or the beginning of the (moving) zodiacs. It is estimated that in about A.D. 285 the two points were coincident. The gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon produces retrogression to the-Equinoctial point leading to divergence in the two systems. In about 26,000 years this point is expected to complete the circle to meet the earlier point. This gives an annual divergence of 50.3\". The Precession of Equinoxes is defined as the earlier occurrence of the equinoxes in each successive sidereal year because of the slow retrograde motion of the equinoctial points along the ecliptic. The division of zodiac into various Signs in the western Tropical system does not refer to the same portion of the zodiac as the Sidereal or Nirayana system. As the referral 00 does not mark the same portion of the ecliptic, the zodiacal signs, though given the same name, are not identical under the two systems. When we speak of converting a Western chart into the Hindu equivalent, it implies subtracting the Ayanamsa from the Tropical longitude. It suggests bringing into focus the same portion of the ecliptic, and the same name of the zodiacal signs while discussing the nature of planetary impulses. Differences have arisen in the estimates of Ayanamsas. All the estimates do not agree on A.D. 285 as the year of nil Ayanamsa. The Western Sidereal astrologers usually use the Ayanamsa developed by Cyril Fagan and Donald Bradley, while in India, the two best known estimates are of N. C. Lahiri and B. V. Raman. For 1990, Lahiri's Ayanamsa is estimated as 230 43' 14\", B.V. Raman's 220 16', 20\", and Fagan-Bradley's 240 23' 46\"; the same for A.D. 2000 will be 230 51' 11\", 220 24' 44\" and 240 44' 11\" respectively. AYUSHA KARAKA :Producer of longevity. (See Karakas) BADHAKADHIPATI :Lord of obstructions. A planet, which invariably creates difficulties whenever it gets a chance to do so. Such a planet has the capacity to destroy the auspicious effects of lucky planets. There are several methods of identifying such a planet. The most extensive view is that the lords of the 11th, 9th or the 7th houses in a natal chart become dependent upon the ascendant or its lord, being placed in a cardinal, fixed or in a common sign. BAHUDHANYA :12th of the 60-year cycle of Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Brahma (q.v). Individuals born during this year are bestowed with religious learning, skill in different arts, and humility in disposition. BAHYA RASI :Also known as Bhoga Rasi. A term used in Jaimini Astrology for deciding the planetary ruler ship operating at any time. It is identified by counting the Dvara Rasi (q.v.) or the house under consideration from the ascendant, and extending the distance further by the same distance. BAJRA YOGA :A planetary combination under which all benefices (q.v.) are located in the 1st and 7th houses in a natal chart. It makes the individual good-natured and lucky during the first and the last phase of his life. BALARAMA :The elder brother of Krishna. Krishna is regarded as the full manifestation of Vishnu, but Balarama according to some is regarded as his seventh avatara. About his birth, the Vaishnavaites believe that Vishnu took two hairs from his body, a white and a black one which took birth as the sons of Devaki and Vasudeva. and became Balarama Krishna. Balarama. was of a fair complexion while Krishna was of a dark blue color. As soon as Krishna was born, he was carried to Gokula village to preserve his life from the tyrant Kamsa. Another legend states that the foetus itself was transferred from Devaki to Rohini (the personifi-cation of the 4th asterism) who became his foster-mother. Balarama and Krishna grew up together. When Krishna went to Mathura, Balarama accompanied"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 172him and effectively supported him till he killed Kamsa. He was very fond of intoxicating drinks. His favorite weapons of assault were club, ploughshare, and pestle. He taught the technique of club fight, the use of mace in assault and defense to both Duryodhana and Bheema, the two heroes of the Mahabharata War fighting from opposite sides. He himself refused to take an active part on any side in the Great War. Balarama was married to Revati, the personification of the 27th asterism. He was considered, according to one view, to be an incarnation of Sesha Naga (q.v.), the mythological serpent that supports the earth on his hood. When Balarama died, a serpent is said to have issued forth from his mouth to go to its divine habitat. BALARISHTA Period of serious affliction with the likelihood of its causing death during the child's infancy. There are three methods used for calculating it, which are known as Gandaristha, Graharistha, and Patakaristha. The first one occurs if a child is born at certain junction-points of zodiacal signs or of asterisms. The boundaries of Cancer-Leo, Scorpio-Sagittarius, and Pisces-Aries are considered inauspicious for this purpose. One-and-a-half-hour before the end of Ashlesha, Jyestha, and Revati, and the same duration before the beginning of Makkha, Moolam, and Ashwini is likely to cause infant mortality. Graharistha refers to certain weak-nesses of planets at birth. Affliction of the Moon is one such important factor. A weak Moon accepted by malefic, and unsupported by any benefice produces the affliction, especially if it occupies the 3rd, 6th, 8th or the 12th house. In case the Moon is strong and is accepted by the powerful beneficial Jupiter, the evil effect is destroyed. Patakistha depends on intricate relationships between certain zodiacal signs. This affliction is worked out on the basis of certain favorable or antipathy relationships between certain planets and signs. Each sign is assigned certain numerical values based on the planet-zodiacal relationships, on which basis the date of fatality is worked out. (For details see Jyotish Ratnakara, vol. I, pp. 214-39) BHACHAKRA :An imaginary belt around the ecliptic through which the planets traverse during their sojourn around the Sun. It represents a space approximately 90 above and 90 below the path of ecliptic on which all the planets, including the Sun, traverse. BHADRAPADA, PURVA :The 25th asterism extending from 3200 00' to 3330 20' of the zodiac. It consists of 2 stars symbolizing a sword. The Vedic deity Aja Ekapada (q.v.) presides over it. Jupiter owns the asterism. Its primary attribute is sattwa (q.v.) and its motivational impulse is artha (q.v.). It imparts fearlessness to those who are spiritual in temperament, but on the materialistic side, anguish and sorrow result from it. It impels the individual to work for universal unity with courage, vision, and complete detachment. Purva Bhadrapada imparts immensely active impulse: it radically affects the personal life of the individual concerned. BHADRAPADA, UTTARA :The 26th asterism which extends from 3330 20' to 3460 40' of the zodiac. Saturn owns the asterism and the Vedic deity Ahir Budhnya (q.v.) presides over it. Purva and Uttara Bhadrapadas complement each other; together they are represented by 4 stars, which symbolise the four legs of a cot. The 2 stars assigned to Uttara Bhadrapada are also said to symbolise a twin as well as the number 2. The primary motivating impulse of Uttara Bhadrapada is kama (q.v.); its primary attribute is sattwa (q.v.). Under this asterism opposing forces clash with each other. The asterism is categorized in the warrior class, and it imparts strong determination to persevere, protect, and cooperate with the Divine Plan, notwithstanding any hardship one may' have to suffer. It is considered masculine, active and completely indifferent to worldly matters. It is classified as cow by species, and it lives to provide nourishment to others. The asterism leads the spiritually inclined individuals towards liberation, Nirvana, but if the individual is still on the materialistic side of evolution, it makes him careless, lazy, irresponsible and dull."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 173BHADRAYOGA :One of the five combinations under Pancha Mahapurushayoga (q.v.) Mercury in exaltation or in its own sign occupying a cardinal house either from ascendant or from the Moon produces Bhadrayoga. The combination produces gracious behavior. Another kind of Bhadrayoga is formed by the Moon and Jupiter placed in the 2nd house, the lord of the 2nd house in the 11th house, and the ascendant lord associated with benefices. The combination makes the person learned, intelligent, capable of understanding the feelings of others. He is skilled in many arts. BHAGA/BHAGA DEVATA :Bhaga means female reproductive organ while Bhaga Devata is a Vedic deity who is invoked to bestow affluence, happiness and good luck. Both of them, in Vedic literature, represent the power that leads to light and delight. Explaining the significance of Bhaga or Bhaga Devata among the Vedic gods, Aurobindo states this deity along with Varuna, Mitra, and Aryaman, to be guardians of Light; these four together build up the divine state into its perfection. Together they also represent the essential trinity of Sachchidananda-Existence (Sat), Consciousness (Chit), and Bliss (Ananda) with self-awareness and self-force, chit and tapas. This state of consciousness and perfection is translated into its cosmic terms and equivalents as the four of all-devas-Vishwadevas. Varuna, the king, has his foundation in the all-pervading purity of Sat; Mitra, the happy and the mighty the most beloved of the gods, in the all-uniting light of Chit, many-charioted Aryaman in the movement and all-discerning force of tapas; while Bhaga is the all-embracing joy of Ananda.Bhaga also refers to the Sun, Moon, and Shiva. It presides over Uttara Phalguni the 12th asterism. BHAKTI :Derived from the root referring to the act of separation, division; commonly translated to mean love, reverence, and devotion. In religion, it refers to divine love, which brings together the Supreme Self and the separated human individual. Realization of this separation produces intense desire for reunification. It can arise due to grief, mutation, or spiritual perception. Narada (q.v.) classified Bhakti in 11 categories, viz., (i) glorification of the Lord's blessed qualities, (ii) infatuation with divine beauty, (iii) worship-ping, GO constant remembering of the Almighty, (v) serving the deity, (vi) friendly affection towards the various incarnations of god, (vii) devotion towards the Supreme as that of a son, (viii) loving as a married partner, (ix) Self-surrendering, (x) complete identification with the deity, and (xi) experiencing the pain of duality. (See Narada Bhakti Sutra, verse 82) Bhakti cult is based on the philosophy of duality. The separation of the devotee from his beloved causes pain. In order to overcome it, he Pines for the object of his love similar to the craving of Gopis for Krishna.Devotion is said to be of 3 kinds, viz., Sattwic (harmonious), Tamasic (inertial), and Rajasic (full of action with a sense of pride). It is approached equally by the mystics as well as by the occultists, making the approach possible both emotionally and intellectually. BHANU :Brightness; a ray of light; beauty; the Sun, the sovereign. (See, Sun) BHARADWAJA A Vedic sage, the son of Brihaspati (q.v.) by Mamata, the wife of Utathya, a rishi of great power. Bharadwaja was the father of Drona, the teacher of the Kauravas and Pandavas. The Taittiriya Brahmana describes him as the sage who lived through three lives and became immortal and ascended the heavenly world to unite with the Sun. In the Mahabharata, he is said to be living in Haridwar. In the Ramayana, he received Rama, Sita and Lakshmana at his hermitage when they were in exile. According to Puranic stories, he was adopted by King Bharat. There is also an allegorical story, which states that his mother, the wife of Utathya, was pregnant by her husband as well as Brihaspati. Dirghatamas, the son of her husband, kicked his half-brother out of the womb before the due time, but at this time Brihaspati told the mother 'Bhara-dwa-jam', meaning, cherish this child of two fathers', and this is how the child got his name Bharadwaja."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 174Bharadwaja is one of the Sapta-rishis, the seven sages, of the present Manvantara (q.v.), and represents the special ray of harmony. His basic teaching emphasizes that thirst for life must be given up for redemption from human bondage and sufferings. BRARANI The 2nd asterism extending from 130 20' to 260 40' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Venus; its presiding deity is Yama (q.v.), the god of death. Artha is its basic motivation, and its primary attribute is Rajas. It consists of 3 stars symbolizing Bhaga, the female generative organ. It is classified as outcaste by caste classification, elephant by species and human being by temperament. The esoteric significance of the asterism is revealed by (i) Bhaga, which also refers to one of the four Vedic gods included under Vishwadevas (q.v.). This god stands for Divine Ecstasy, or Bliss, which is a basic aspect of the Supreme Spirit. The asterism as such produces great delight which may sometimes be followed by material disappointment. The second aspect of the asterism is signified by (ii) Shakti, which as the asterisms primeval element provides the necessary environmental backing for its creative functions. (iii) Yama, the presiding deity of the asterism reveals its third main feature. Yama leads to complete annihilation of everything phenomenal. The asterism is expected to reveal the inner subjective significance of different conditions of existence. (See MSVA pp. 174-76) BHASKARA [(Bhas = light, lustre) + (kara = to cause)]. A name given to the Sun. It stands for the 'life-giver' and 'the light-maker'. BHASKARA YOGA A planetary combination formed by Mercury placed 2nd from Sun, Moon 11th from Mercury, and Jupiter in a trine house from the Moon. These conditions imply that Mercury is 2nd from Sun, Moon is 12th, and Jupiter is either in the 4th or the 8th house from Sun. A person born under this combination is courageous, powerful, learned, has deep knowledge of religious scriptures, mathematics and classical music. BHAVA (i) A house-division in a natal chart corresponding to the signification of a house. In equal house division chart, each house measures 30 degrees and corresponds to a zodiacal sign; these house divisions do not necessarily correspond to an aspect of life as denoted by different house divisions. There are several methods for deciding the extent of different bhavas: the Regiomontanus' house division is one such method of demarcating the limits of a house. Depending upon the latitude, season, and time of birth, the size of different bhavas in a horoscope may be different from one another. (ii) Bhava is also the 8th year in a cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is presided over by Brahma. Persons born during this year are ambitious, skilled in many arts, and fond of flesh-food. BHAVA KUNDALI The horoscope in which planets are shown in different house divisions worked out on the basis of precise delineation of different bhavas, which are neither necessarily synchronous with zodiacal signs, nor of equal divisions. BHAVA MADHYA The mid-point of the extension of a house division. BHAVA SANDHI The borderline between two house divisions. Planets situated at these points are considered ineffective. BHAVAT BHAVAM :An important principle of predictive Vedic astrology. It suggests that the significance of a house is deciphered by the disposition of the same house relative to it. It implies that the significance of, for example, the 2nd house can be determined also by taking into account the 2nd house from the 2nd house, which will be the 3rd house in a natal chart. To give another example, the significance of the 5th house should be decided in conjunction also with the 5th from the 5th house, which will be the 9th house in the horoscope. BHAVYA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by Moon in the 10th house, the navamsa lord of Moon in exaltation, and the lord of the 9th house associated with the lord of the 2nd house. This combination makes a person rich, respected and learned; he may be renowned as a botanist and a collec-tor of artifacts."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 175BHERI YOGA :The planetary combination which is formed in 3 ways: (i) all planets occupy the ascendant, in the 2nd, 7th, and 10th houses; (ii) Venus and the lord of ascendant are placed in a cardinal house from the ascendant, and the lord of the 9th house is strong. (iii) Venus and the lord of Ascendant and Jupiter are in mutual angles and the lord of the 9th house is strong. All these combinations make the individual learned in scientific subjects, practical in mundane affairs, and well provided with wealth and luxuries of life. BHIKSHU :From the word Bhikkhu in Pali language; a mendicant. BHOGA :Experiencing sexual enjoyment; an object of pleasure. The expanded hood of a serpent. RHOGA KARAKA :Venus; the planet of affluence and sensual pleasure. BHOGYAMSA :Longitudinal distance traversed (specially in any specific zodiacal sign). BHOGAYONI :[(Bhoga = experiencing of pleasure as well as of sufferings) + (Yoni = womb, female generative organ, a place, a species)] = The individual born to experience the conditions of life imposed on him.] The individuals born primarily to reap the consequences of their earlier karmas (q.v.). It assumes that the present efforts of an individual are not (very much) reflected in the existing conditions of his life, especially the pleasures and sorrows he is made to suffer. Bhoga Yoni refers to such individuals who are born mainly to experience these consequences, while Karina Yoni refers to such individuals who are born primarily to generate fresh karmas and their past karmic fruits are temporarily put in abeyance. They may not be allotted the fruits of past karmas to be born in the given incarnation which they may have to encounter in subsequent births. Devas or the shining ones belong to the first category, while the human individuals generally belong to the latter. In fact, a clear-cut distinction between these two categories among the human individuals is not always possible. BHRATRI KARAKA :Significator of brothers. Apart from Mars which is the natural Bhratri Karaka planet, the lord of the 3rd house and the planet attaining the third highest longitudinal distance among all the Signs also acquires this status. BHRIGU :A Vedic sage and seer. He is called a 'Son' by Manu (q.v.) who confides to him his Institutes, the basic elements of his jurisprudence. Bhrigu is one of the seven Prajapatis (q.v.) and is regarded as the founder of the race of Bhrigus or the Bhargavas in which was born Jamad-agni and Parasurama. Bhrigu also stands as an epithet for the planet Venus and the sage who identified Vishnu as the God worthy of universal worship among the Trinity (q.v.). He officiated at Daksha's performance of sacrifice, yajna; Bhrigu had a beard which at the turmoil ensuing at the yajna was pulled out by Shiva. Blavatsky mentioned that \"the very erudite Dr Kenealy made Bhrigu the fourth, out of his twelve 'divine messengers' to the world, adding that his religion spread even to Britain where his followers raised the megalithic temple of Stonehenge\". But she added that this is a hypothesis based merely on Dr Kenealy's personal speculation. (See Glossary, p. 57) BHUJA :Arms; sides of a triangle. BHUKTI :Sub-period of planetary ruler ship within the main Dasa Period (q.v.). BHUMl :Land; Earth. BHUMI PUTRA [(Bhumi = Earth) + (Putra = Son) Earth's Son]. The planet Mars. BHUPA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lord of the 5th or 9th house from the sign where & Navamsa lord of Rahu is posited occupying its own sign and expected by Mars. The combination makes the individual born under it victorious in warfare and bestows on him high military status. BHUTA :Means that which is over. Any being, divine, human or others. Mythological, it refers to malignant spirits. In Vayu Purana, Krodha (anger) is said to be their mother. The Bhutas are the attendants of Shiva, who is held to be their king. Metaphysically, the Bhutas stand for that which stimulates sense organs. In the sense of Panch Bhutas or the five"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 176primeval elements, they stand for Prithvi (earth), Apas or Jala (water), Tejas or Agni (fire), Vayu (air) and Akasha (ether or sky). (See Panch Maha Bhutas) BHUTASARGA :[(Bhuta = being, past) + (sarga creation)]. The second creation of the elements; the creation of the world; the class or order of created beings. BIJA :(Also spelt as Vija) [bi = to disjoin, scatter, separate; jan = to generate, produce, be born]; seed; semen; germ; to go in different directions; to diffuse. Also implies the cause or the beginning of any chain reaction. The nucleus. BIJASPHUTA :[(Bijam = seed, semen) + (sphuta = bursting forth, manifestation) = possibility of begetting progeny]. A factor in determining the possibility of begetting a child of one's own. Along with kshetra sphuta (q.v.) and progeny tithi sphuta (q.v.) this factor is used in deciding the final outcome. Bijasphuta is applicable to male horoscopes, and kshetra sphuta to female horoscopes; and progeny tithi sphuta is used for calculating the highly opportune date for copulation with a view to begetting an offspring. One method of calculating the child-bearing possibilities is to add the longitudes of the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter in the husband's chart and work out the resultant sign and its navamsa (q.v.). Alternatively, the longitude of the Sun can be multiplied by 4, and that of Venus and Jupiter by 3, and then together, to find out the sign and its navamsa. If both, the resulting signand navamsa are odd signs, the individual is virile with good prospects of begetting an offspring; if both are even, the virility is doubtful. In case one is an odd sign and the other even, the progeny may be delayed but there is a possibility of one's having his own offspring. BRAHMA :(Neuter). The supreme soul of the universe, self-existent, absolute, and eternal from which all things emanate and to which all return. It must be distinguished from Brahman, and Brahma (masculine) (q.v.) (pronounced Brahmaa). Brahma (neutral) is sometimes also known as Brahman (q.v.), which is the impersonal, supreme and unrecognizable principle of the universe, from the essence of which everything emanates and into which everything returns, which is incorporeal, immaterial, unborn, beginning less, and eternal. It is all pervading and infinite in its manifestation, in all nature, animate and inanimate, in the highest god, and is manifested in the tiniest creature. Although not worshipped, it is the object of abstract meditation practiced to obtain absorption into it and thus getting released from bondage and restrictions. BRAHMA :(Masculine) (pronounced Brahmaa): The first member of the Hindu Trinity, the other two being Vishnu and Mahesh (also known as Shiva). He is the Supreme Spirit manifest as the active creator of the universe; the male and the alleged creator, exists periodically in his manifestation only, and then goes into Pralaya, dissolution. In Vedic theology, he sprang from Hiranyagarbha, the mundane or the golden egg deposited by the supreme first cause. Aurobindo states that Brihaspati (q.v.), Brahmanaspati (the deity presiding over Jupiter), and Brahma were considered almost identical by the ancient sages. In the later Puranic theologies, Brihaspati and Brahma became separate deities. Brihaspati did not possess great importance and was relegated as the spiritual teacher of gods, and incidentally as the guardian of Jupiter, while Brahmanaspati, who once linked the two, disappeared altogether. Brahma is the Prajapati, the lord and father of all creatures. He began manifestation by dividing himself in two, male and female. When Brahma created the world, it remained unchanged for one of his days, which lasted for 2,160 million mortal years. Everything, except the sages, gods, and elements in the world are then consumed by fire. When he wakes up, after a similar period of night, he again restores creation, and the process is repeated for a hundred years, measured in terms of the duration of his days and nights. After this, he himself expires, and along with all the gods, sages, and the universe resolves into the constituent elements."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 177Brahma is said to be red in color, has 4 heads, one of his heads (the fifth) having been burnt by Shiva because it had spoken disrespectfully. Brahma has four hands and 8 ears. BRAHMAN :(Also see Brahmin) Generally refers to the highest caste in ancient India, the sacerdotal class, the members of which may be, but are not necessarily, priests. It also refers to the works composed by and for Brahmins; occasionally used as a synonym of Brahma (neuter). As sacred books, they are commentaries on those portions of the Vedas which were intended for ritualistic use and guidance of the dvijas (the twice-born) or the Brahmins. Aurobindo states that Brahman in the Vedas signifies ordinarily the Vedic word or mantra in its profoundest aspect as the expression of the intuition arising out of the depths of the soul or being. It is the voice of the rhythm which has created the worlds and goes on creating perpetually. This vast being, this all-containing and all-formulating consciousness is Brahma. It is the soul that emerges out of the sub conscient in Man and rises towards the super coincident. The word of creative power willing upwards out of the same is also Brahman. (See SoV, pp. 303-13) BRAHMANASPATI :A Vedic deity; known as the planet Jupiter in exoteric works. This deity is supposed to link together two cosmic creative functions. The all-containing and all-fonnulating consciousness creates the worlds out of the waters of sub conscient by the mantras. The word power is different from the conscious soul power at the root of manifestation. The former, represented by Brihaspati, is an expression of the latter, Brahma. In the name Brihaspati, the two varying stresses are unified and equalized. It is the link between the general and the special aspects of the same deity, variously known as the Divine, the Deva, or the Supreme. BRAHMARANDRA :(Brahma = the Supreme Spirit; randra = a slit, fissure, hole). A term used in yogic literature. It refers to an aperture on the top of the head through which the soul is supposed to exit at death (See Kundalini). A spot on the crown of the head (See Sahasrare) connected with the heart by Sushumna Nadi (q.v.), a nerve in the spinal column. BRAHMARISHI :A great sage belonging to the Brahmin caste. A rishi is a sage or an inspired poet, but the Indian tradition graded them as different orders of Prajapatis (q.v.). These grades are (i) Rajarishi, (ii) Brahmarishi, and (iii) Devarishi. Rajarishi is a royal sage, a man of the kshatriya caste (of princely or royal status) who by his pure and holy life on earth to be a great sage, demi-god has risen to Indra's heaven. Brahmarishis belong to the highest caste and by their austerity and saintliness have attained the wisdom of the Supreme Self. Devarishis are divine sages of the celestial class, who dwell in the regions of the gods, such as Narada. These sages are generally the mind born sons of Brahma or they have attained perfection upon earth and are given the exalted status. BRAHMAVIDYA :The wisdom about the Supreme Self. The knowledge, the esoteric wisdom, about Brahma (neuter and masculine) and his true nature in both the aspects. BRAHMIN :(Also known as Brahman). The first of the four castes, the-sacerdotal class, the members of which may be, but are not necessarily, priests. A Brahmin is the chief of all created beings; his person is inviolate; he is entitled to all honors, and enjoys many rights and privileges. According to Shatapatha Brahmana, Brahmans are the gods who have learnt the Vedas and chant them; they are human gods. The chief duty of a Brahman is to study and teach the Vedas; to perform sacrifices, yajnas, and other religious functions. All the asterisms (q.v.) are classified according to the four castes to indicate their nature, duties, and general influence. Asterisms classified as Brahmans are Krittika, Purva Phalguni, Purvashada, and Purva Bhadrapada. BRIHASPATI :A Vedic deity and preceptor of gods; the planet Jupiter (q.v.). BRIHAT SAMHITA :A celebrated work of astrology by Varaharnihira (A.D. 505-576). The term Samhita means 'compilation, and Brihat Samhita (Major Compilation), encyclopedic in its contents' deals with almost every subject even remotely connected with predictive science. It includes detailed chapters on astrological, seismological, sexual, and"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 178psychological subjects. It also dwells upon portents, market fluctuations, gems and precious stones, palmistry, physiognomy and worship of stellar deities. The work is executed in superb poetic language. Al-Beruni, who came to India in A.D. 1030, translated the work into Arabic and introduced it to the Middle East and the West. During recent times, Dr.. Kern translated it in English and it is now available as translated and annotated by many Indian writers too. BUDDHA :The enlightened being who reveals to the world the way to Liberation, Nirvana. To become a Buddha, one has to break through the bondage of sense and personality to acquire complete perception of the Real Self and learn not to separate it from all other selves. (See also Buddha Siddhartha) BUDDHA SIDDHARTHA :The name given to Gautam, the prince of Kapilavastu, the son of king Suddhodhana. Gautam was born in 621 B.C. He left his father's palace to become an ascetic in 597 B.C., became a full Buddha on the full moon night of Vaisakha in 592 B.C. and entered Nirvana in 543 B.C. These dates are given differently by different traditions, though only with slight variations. Siddhartha was the most perfect of all mortal men that the world has even seen. Gautarn Buddha, the fourth of the seven Buddhas and seven Tathagatas, had the most powerful influence in spiritualising the world. He is considered the ninth avatara of the Hindus. (See The Light of Asia by Sir Edwin Arnold) According to Dr B.V. Raman, Gautam Buddha was born on 14 April 623 B.C. at about middday at Lat. 270 8' North, Long. 830 5' East, the planetary position of the epoch is given as Sun 290 Y; Moon 2000 45'; Mars 260 54'; Mercury 530 6'; Jupiter 110; Venus 60 12'; Saturn 240 36'; Rahu 860 54' and Lagna 116045'. Ayanamsa +140 16'. BUDDHI :Universal soul; mind. Cognition of sensations through the sense organs resulting from the interaction of mind (citta) which produces knowledge of the external world. It produces intuitive awareness either of the inherent qualities of an external object or higher spiritual laws and their operations, which are not perceived by consciousness. It is intuitive awareness, resulting from intonations of spiritual illumination. It functions like a mirror reflecting the spiritual, Atmic, messages. In the reverse process it filters the mundane experiences to comprehend the Atmic manifestation. In Sankhya philosophy, Buddhi is the second of the 20 elements involved in manifestation. Astrologically, the Moon reflects Buddhic consciousness and stands as a component of the higher triad, represented by Atma (Sun), Buddhi (Moon) and Manas or Citti (Mercury). BUDDH :Wise, intelligent. The planet Mercury, son of Soma, the Moon, Rohini or by Tara, who was a wife of Jupiter. Buddh married Ila, daughter of Manu Vaivasvata, and from her had a son named Pururava. [Ila or Ida is primarily food, refreshment or libation of milk. She is called the instructress of man.] BUDDHAYOGA :A planetary combination formed by Jupiter in ascendant, Moon in a cardinal position from Jupiter, Rahu in 2nd from Moon, and the Sun or Mars in 3rd from Moon. An individual boom under this combination attains renown, erudition, intelligence, and a social status of high order. He does not have enemies. BADHAKADHIPATI :Lord of obstructions. A planet, which invariably creates difficulties whenever it gets a chance to do so. Such a planet has the capacity to destroy the auspicious effects of lucky planets. There are several methods of identifying such a planet. The most extensive view is that the lords of the 11th, 9th or the 7th houses in a natal chart become dependent upon the ascendant or its lord, being placed in a cardinal, fixed or in a common sign. BAHUDHANYA :12th of the 60-year cycle of Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Brahma. Individuals born during this year are bestowed with religious learning, skill in different arts, and humility in disposition. BAHYA RASI :Also known as Bhoga Rasi. A term used in Jaimini Astrology for deciding the planetary ruler ship operating at any time. It is identified by counting the Dvara Rasi"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 179(q.v.) or the house under consideration from the ascendant, and extending the distance further by the same distance. BAJRA YOGA :A planetary combination under which all benefices (q.v.) are located in the 1st and 7th houses in a natal chart. It makes the individual good-natured and lucky during the first and the last phase of his life. BALARAMA :The elder brother of Krishna. Krishna is regarded as the full manifestation of Vishnu, but Balarama according to some is regarded as his seventh avatara. About his birth, the Vaishnavaites believe that Vishnu took two hairs from his body, a white and a black one which took birth as the sons of Devaki and Vasudeva. and became Balarama Krishna. Balarama. was of a fair complexion while Krishna was of a dark blue color. As soon as Krishna was born, he was carried to Gokula village to preserve his life from the tyrant Kamsa. Another legend states that the foetus itself was transferred from Devaki to Rohini (the personifi-cation of the 4th asterism) who became his foster-mother. Balarama and Krishna grew up together. When Krishna went to Mathura, Balarama accompanied him and effectively supported him till he killed Kamsa. He was very fond of intoxicating drinks. His favorite weapons of assault were club, ploughshare, and pestle. He taught the technique of club fight, the use of mace in assault and defense to both Duryodhana and Bheema, the two heroes of the Mahabharata War fighting from opposite sides. He himself refused to take an active part on any side in the Great War. Balarama was married to Revati, the personification of the 27th asterism. He was considered, according to one view, to be an incarnation of Sesha Naga (q.v.), the mythological serpent that supports the earth on his hood. When Balarama died, a serpent is said to have issued forth from his mouth to go to its divine habitat. BALARISHTA :Period of serious affliction with the likelihood of its causing death during the child's infancy. There are three methods used for calculating it, which are known as Gandaristha, Graharistha, and Patakaristha. The first one occurs if a child is born at certain junction-points of zodiacal signs or of asterisms. The boundaries of Cancer-Leo, Scorpio-Sagittarius, and Pisces-Aries are considered inauspicious for this purpose. One-and-a-half-hour before the end of Ashlesha, Jyestha, and Revati, and the same duration before the beginning of Makkha, Moolam, and Ashwini is likely to cause infant mortality. Graharistha refers to certain weak-nesses of planets at birth. Affliction of the Moon is one such important factor. A weak Moon accepted by malefic, and unsupported by any benefice produces the affliction, especially if it occupies the 3rd, 6th, 8th or the 12th house. In case the Moon is strong and is accepted by the powerful beneficial Jupiter, the evil effect is destroyed. Patakistha depends on intricate relationships between certain zodiacal signs. This affliction is worked out on the basis of certain favorable or antipathy relationships between certain planets and signs. Each sign is assigned certain numerical values based on the planet-zodiacal relationships, on which basis the date of fatality is worked out. (For details see Jyotish Ratnakara, vol. I, pp. 214-39) BHACHAKRA :An imaginary belt around the ecliptic through which the planets traverse during their sojourn around the Sun. It represents a space approximately 90 above and 90 below the path of ecliptic on which all the planets, including the Sun, traverse. BHADRAPADA, PURVA :The 25th asterism extending from 3200 00' to 3330 20' of the zodiac. It consists of 2 stars symbolizing a sword. The Vedic deity Aja Ekapada (q.v.) presides over it. Jupiter owns the asterism. Its primary attribute is sattwa (q.v.) and its motivational impulse is artha (q.v.). It imparts fearlessness to those who are spiritual in temperament, but on the materialistic side, anguish and sorrow result from it. It impels the individual to work for universal unity with courage, vision, and complete detachment. Purva Bhadrapada imparts immensely active impulse: it radically affects the personal life of the individual concerned. BHADRAPADA, UTTARA :The 26th asterism which extends"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 180from 3330 20' to 3460 40' of the zodiac. Saturn owns the asterism and the Vedic deity Ahir Budhnya (q.v.) presides over it. Purva and Uttara Bhadrapadas complement each other; together they are represented by 4 stars, which symbolise the four legs of a cot. The 2 stars assigned to Uttara Bhadrapada are also said to symbolise a twin as well as the number 2. The primary motivating impulse of Uttara Bhadrapada is kama (q.v.); its primary attribute is sattwa (q.v.). Under this asterism opposing forces clash with each other. The asterism is categorized in the warrior class, and it imparts strong determination to persevere, protect, and cooperate with the Divine Plan, notwithstanding any hardship one may' have to suffer. It is considered masculine, active and completely indifferent to worldly matters. It is classified as cow by species, and it lives to provide nourishment to others. The asterism leads the spiritually inclined individuals towards liberation, Nirvana, but if the individual is still on the materialistic side of evolution, it makes him careless, lazy, irresponsible and dull. BHADRAYOGA :One of the five combinations under Pancha Mahapurushayoga (q.v.) Mercury in exaltation or in its own sign occupying a cardinal house either from ascendant or from the Moon produces Bhadrayoga. The combination produces gracious behavior. Another kind of Bhadrayoga is formed by the Moon and Jupiter placed in the 2nd house, the lord of the 2nd house in the 11th house, and the ascendant lord associated with benefices. The combination makes the person learned, intelligent, capable of understanding the feelings of others. He is skilled in many arts. BHAGA/BHAGA DEVATA :Bhaga means female reproductive organ while Bhaga Devata is a Vedic deity who is invoked to bestow affluence, happiness and good luck. Both of them, in Vedic literature, represent the power that leads to light and delight. Explaining the significance of Bhaga or Bhaga Devata among the Vedic gods, Aurobindo states this deity along with Varuna, Mitra, and Aryaman, to be guardians of Light; these four together build up the divine state into its perfection. Together they also represent the essential trinity of Sachchidananda-Existence (Sat), Consciousness (Chit), and Bliss (Ananda) with self-awareness and self-force, chit and tapas. This state of consciousness and perfection is translated into its cosmic terms and equivalents as the four of all-devas-Vishwadevas. Varuna, the king, has his foundation in the all-pervading purity of Sat; Mitra, the happy and the mighty the most beloved of the gods, in the all-uniting light of Chit, many-charioted Aryaman in the movement and all-discerning force of tapas; while Bhaga is the all-embracing joy of Ananda. Bhaga also refers to the Sun, Moon, and Shiva. It presides over Uttara Phalguni, the 12th asterism. BHAKTI :Derived from the root referring to the act of separation, division; commonly translated to mean love, reverence, and devotion. In religion, it refers to divine love, which brings together the Supreme Self and the separated human individual. Realization of this separation produces intense desire for reunification. It can arise due to grief, mutation, or spiritual perception. Narada (q.v.) classified Bhakti in 11 categories, viz., (i) glorification of the Lord's blessed qualities, (ii) infatuation with divine beauty, (iii) worship-ping, GO constant remembering of the Almighty, (v) serving the deity, (vi) friendly affection towards the various incarnations of god, (vii) devotion towards the Supreme as that of a son, (viii) loving as a married partner, (ix) Self-surrendering, (x) complete identification with the deity, and (xi) experiencing the pain of duality. (See Narada Bhakti Sutra, verse 82) Bhakti cult is based on the philosophy of duality. The separation of the devotee from his beloved causes pain. In order to overcome it, he Pines for the object of his love similar to the craving of Gopis for Krishna."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 181Devotion is said to be of 3 kinds, viz., Sattwic (harmonious), Tamasic (inertial), and Rajasic (full of action with a sense of pride). It is approached equally by the mystics as well as by the occultists, making the approach possible both emotionally and intellectually. BHANU :Brightness; a ray of light; beauty; the Sun, the sovereign. (See, Sun) BHARADWAJA :A Vedic sage, the son of Brihaspati (q.v.) by Mamata, the wife of Utathya, a rishi of great power. Bharadwaja was the father of Drona, the teacher of the Kauravas and Pandavas. The Taittiriya Brahmana describes him as the sage who lived through three lives and became immortal and ascended the heavenly world to unite with the Sun. In the Mahabharata, he is said to be living in Haridwar. In the Ramayana, he received Rama, Sita and Lakshmana at his hermitage when they were in exile. According to Puranic stories, he was adopted by King Bharat. There is also an allegorical story, which states that his mother, the wife of Utathya, was pregnant by her husband as well as Brihaspati. Dirghatamas, the son of her husband, kicked his half-brother out of the womb before the due time, but at this time Brihaspati told the mother 'Bhara-dwa-jam', meaning, cherish this child of two fathers', and this is how the child got his name Bharadwaja. Bharadwaja is one of the Sapta-rishis, the seven sages, of the present Manvantara (q.v.), and represents the special ray of harmony. His basic teaching emphasizes that thirst for life must be given up for redemption from human bondage and sufferings. BRARANI :The 2nd asterism extending from 130 20' to 260 40' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Venus; its presiding deity is Yama (q.v.), the god of death. Artha is its basic motivation, and its primary attribute is Rajas. It consists of 3 stars symbolizing Bhaga, the female generative organ. It is classified as outcaste by caste classification, elephant by species and human being by temperament. The esoteric significance of the asterism is revealed by (i) Bhaga, which also refers to one of the four Vedic gods included under Vishwadevas. This god stands for Divine Ecstasy, or Bliss, which is a basic aspect of the Supreme Spirit. The asterism as such produces great delight which may sometimes be followed by material disappointment. The second aspect of the asterism is signified by (ii) Shakti, which as the asterisms primeval element provides the necessary environmental backing for its creative functions. (iii) Yama, the presiding deity of the asterism reveals its third main feature. Yama leads to complete annihilation of everything phenomenal. The asterism is expected to reveal the inner subjective significance of different conditions of existence. BHASKARA :[(Bhas = light, lustre) + (kara = to cause)]. A name given to the Sun. It stands for the 'life-giver' and 'the light-maker'. BHASKARA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by Mercury placed 2nd from Sun, Moon 11th from Mercury, and Jupiter in a trine house from the Moon. These conditions imply that Mercury is 2nd from Sun, Moon is 12th, and Jupiter is either in the 4th or the 8th house from Sun. A person born under this combination is courageous, powerful, learned, has deep knowledge of religious scriptures, mathematics and classical music. BHAVA :(i) A house-division in a natal chart corresponding to the signification of a house. In equal house division chart, each house measures 30 degrees and corresponds to a zodiacal sign; these house divisions do not necessarily correspond to an aspect of life as denoted by different house divisions. There are several methods for deciding the extent of different bhavas: the Regiomontanus' house division is one such method of demarcating the limits of a house. Depending upon the latitude, season, and time of birth, the size of different bhavas in a horoscope may be different from one another. (ii) Bhava is also the 8th year in a cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is presided over by Brahma. Persons born during this year are ambitious, skilled in many arts, and fond of flesh-food."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 182BHAVA KUNDALI :The horoscope in which planets are shown in different house divisions worked out on the basis of precise delineation of different bhavas, which are neither necessarily synchronous with zodiacal signs, nor of equal divisions.

BHERI YOGA :The planetary combination which is formed in 3 ways: (i) all planets occupy the ascendant, in the 2nd, 7th, and 10th houses; (ii) Venus and the lord of ascendant are placed in a cardinal house from the ascendant, and the lord of the 9th house is strong. (iii) Venus and the lord of Ascendant and Jupiter are in mutual angles and the lord of the 9th house is strong. All these combinations make the individual learned in scientific subjects, practical in mundane affairs, and well provided with wealth and luxuries of life. BHIKSHU :From the word Bhikkhu in Pali language; a mendicant. BHOGA :Experiencing sexual enjoyment; an object of pleasure. The expanded hood of a serpent. RHOGA KARAKA :Venus; the planet of affluence and sensual pleasure. BHOGYAMSA :Longitudinal distance traversed (specially in any specific zodiacal sign). BHOGAYONI :[(Bhoga = experiencing of pleasure as well as of sufferings) + (Yoni = womb, female generative organ, a place, a species)] = The individual born to experience the conditions of life imposed on him.] The individuals born primarily to reap the consequences of their earlier karmas (q.v.). It assumes that the present efforts of an individual are not (very much) reflected in the existing conditions of his life, especially the pleasures and sorrows he is made to suffer. Bhoga Yoni refers to such individuals who are born mainly to experience these consequences, while Karina Yoni refers to such individuals who are born primarily to generate fresh karmas and their past karmic fruits are temporarily put in abeyance. They may not be allotted the fruits of past karmas to be born in the given incarnation which they may have to encounter in subsequent births. Devas or the shining ones belong to the first category, while the human individuals generally belong to the latter. In fact, a clear-cut distinction between these two categories among the human individuals is not always possible. BHRATRI KARAKA :Significator of brothers. Apart from Mars which is the natural Bhratri Karaka planet, the lord of the 3rd house and the planet attaining the third highest longitudinal distance among all the Signs also acquires this status. BHRIGU :A Vedic sage and seer. He is called a 'Son' by Manu (q.v.) who confides to him his Institutes, the basic elements of his jurisprudence. Bhrigu is one of the seven Prajapatis (q.v.) and is regarded as the founder of the race of Bhrigus or the Bhargavas in which was born Jamad-agni and Parasurama. Bhrigu also stands as an epithet for the planet Venus and the sage who identified Vishnu as the God worthy of universal worship among the Trinity (q.v.). He officiated at Daksha's performance of sacrifice, yajna; Bhrigu had a beard which at the turmoil ensuing at the yajna was pulled out by Shiva. Blavatsky mentioned that \"the very erudite Dr Kenealy made Bhrigu the fourth, out of his twelve 'divine"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 183messengers' to the world, adding that his religion spread even to Britain where his followers raised the megalithic temple of Stonehenge\". But she added that this is a hypothesis based merely on Dr Kenealy's personal speculation. (See Glossary, p. 57) BHUJA :Arms; sides of a triangle. BHUKTI :Sub-period of planetary ruler ship within the main Dasa Period (q.v.). BHUMl :Land; Earth. BHUMI PUTRA [(Bhumi = Earth) + (Putra = Son) Earth's Son]. The planet Mars. BHUPA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lord of the 5th or 9th house from the sign where & Navamsa lord of Rahu is posited occupying its own sign and expected by Mars. The combination makes the individual born under it victorious in warfare and bestows on him high military status. BHUTA :Means that which is over. Any being, divine, human or others. Mythological, it refers to malignant spirits. In Vayu Purana, Krodha (anger) is said to be their mother. The Bhutas are the attendants of Shiva, who is held to be their king. Metaphysically, the Bhutas stand for that which stimulates sense organs. In the sense of Panch Bhutas or the five primeval elements, they stand for Prithvi (earth), Apas or Jala (water), Tejas or Agni (fire), Vayu (air) and Akasha (ether or sky). (See Panch Maha Bhutas) BHUTASARGA :[(Bhuta = being, past) + (sarga creation)]. The second creation of the elements; the creation of the world; the class or order of created beings. BIJA :(Also spelt as Vija) [bi = to disjoin, scatter, separate; jan = to generate, produce, be born]; seed; semen; germ; to go in different directions; to diffuse. Also implies the cause or the beginning of any chain reaction. The nucleus. BIJASPHUTA :[(Bijam = seed, semen) + (sphuta = bursting forth, manifestation) = possibility of begetting progeny]. A factor in determining the possibility of begetting a child of one's own. Along with kshetra sphuta (q.v.) and progeny tithi sphuta (q.v.) this factor is used in deciding the final outcome. Bijasphuta is applicable to male horoscopes, and kshetra sphuta to female horoscopes; and progeny tithi sphuta is used for calculating the highly opportune date for copulation with a view to begetting an offspring. One method of calculating the child-bearing possibilities is to add the longitudes of the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter in the husband's chart and work out the resultant sign and its navamsa (q.v.). Alternatively, the longitude of the Sun can be multiplied by 4, and that of Venus and Jupiter by 3, and then together, to find out the sign and its navamsa. If both, the resulting signand navamsa are odd signs, the individual is virile with good prospects of begetting an offspring; if both are even, the virility is doubtful. In case one is an odd sign and the other even, the progeny may be delayed but there is a possibility of one's having his own offspring. BRAHMA :(Neuter). The supreme soul of the universe, self-existent, absolute, and eternal from which all things emanate and to which all return. It must be distinguished from Brahman, and Brahma (masculine) (q.v.) (pronounced Brahmaa). Brahma (neutral) is sometimes also known as Brahman (q.v.), which is the impersonal, supreme and unrecognizable principle of the universe, from the essence of which everything emanates and into which everything returns, which is incorporeal, immaterial, unborn, beginning less, and eternal. It is all pervading and infinite in its manifestation, in all nature, animate and inanimate, in the highest god, and is manifested in the tiniest creature. Although not worshipped, it is the object of abstract meditation practiced to obtain absorption into it and thus getting released from bondage and restrictions. BRAHMA :(Masculine) (pronounced Brahmaa): The first member of the Hindu Trinity, the other two being Vishnu and Mahesh (also known as Shiva). He is the Supreme Spirit manifest as the active creator of the universe; the male and the alleged creator, exists periodically in his manifestation only, and then goes into Pralaya, dissolution. In Vedic"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 184theology, he sprang from Hiranyagarbha, the mundane or the golden egg deposited by the supreme first cause. Aurobindo states that Brihaspati (q.v.), Brahmanaspati (the deity presiding over Jupiter), and Brahma were considered almost identical by the ancient sages. In the later Puranic theologies, Brihaspati and Brahma became separate deities. Brihaspati did not possess great importance and was relegated as the spiritual teacher of gods, and incidentally as the guardian of Jupiter, while Brahmanaspati, who once linked the two, disappeared altogether. Brahma is the Prajapati, the lord and father of all creatures. He began manifestation by dividing himself in two, male and female. When Brahma created the world, it remained unchanged for one of his days, which lasted for 2,160 million mortal years. Everything, except the sages, gods, and elements in the world are then consumed by fire. When he wakes up, after a similar period of night, he again restores creation, and the process is repeated for a hundred years, measured in terms of the duration of his days and nights. After this, he himself expires, and along with all the gods, sages, and the universe resolves into the constituent elements. Brahma is said to be red in color, has 4 heads, one of his heads (the fifth) having been burnt by Shiva because it had spoken disrespectfully. Brahma has four hands and 8 ears. BRAHMAN :(Also see Brahmin) Generally refers to the highest caste in ancient India, the sacerdotal class, the members of which may be, but are not necessarily, priests. It also refers to the works composed by and for Brahmins; occasionally used as a synonym of Brahma (neuter). As sacred books, they are commentaries on those portions of the Vedas which were intended for ritualistic use and guidance of the dvijas (the twice-born) or the Brahmins. Aurobindo states that Brahman in the Vedas signifies ordinarily the Vedic word or mantra in its profoundest aspect as the expression of the intuition arising out of the depths of the soul or being. It is the voice of the rhythm which has created the worlds and goes on creating perpetually. This vast being, this all-containing and all-formulating consciousness is Brahma. It is the soul that emerges out of the sub conscient in Man and rises towards the super coincident. The word of creative power willing upwards out of the same is also Brahman. (See SoV, pp. 303-13) BRAHMANASPATI :A Vedic deity; known as the planet Jupiter in exoteric works. This deity is supposed to link together two cosmic creative functions. The all-containing and all-fonnulating consciousness creates the worlds out of the waters of sub conscient by the mantras. The word power is different from the conscious soul power at the root of manifestation. The former, represented by Brihaspati, is an expression of the latter, Brahma. In the name Brihaspati, the two varying stresses are unified and equalized. It is the link between the general and the special aspects of the same deity, variously known as the Divine, the Deva, or the Supreme. BRAHMARANDRA :(Brahma = the Supreme Spirit; randra = a slit, fissure, hole). A term used in yogic literature. It refers to an aperture on the top of the head through which the soul is supposed to exit at death (See Kundalini). A spot on the crown of the head (See Sahasrare) connected with the heart by Sushumna Nadi (q.v.), a nerve in the spinal column. BRAHMARISHI :A great sage belonging to the Brahmin caste. A rishi is a sage or an inspired poet, but the Indian tradition graded them as different orders of Prajapatis (q.v.). These grades are (i) Rajarishi, (ii) Brahmarishi, and (iii) Devarishi. Rajarishi is a royal sage, a man of the kshatriya caste (of princely or royal status) who by his pure and holy life on earth to be a great sage, demi-god has risen to Indra's heaven. Brahmarishis belong to the highest caste and by their austerity and saintliness have attained the wisdom of the Supreme Self. Devarishis are divine sages of the celestial class, who dwell in the regions of the gods, such as Narada. These sages are generally the mind born sons of Brahma or they have attained perfection upon earth and are given the exalted status."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 185BRAHMAVIDYA :The wisdom about the Supreme Self. The knowledge, the esoteric wisdom, about Brahma (neuter and masculine) and his true nature in both the aspects. BRAHMIN :(Also known as Brahman). The first of the four castes, the-sacerdotal class, the members of which may be, but are not necessarily, priests. A Brahmin is the chief of all created beings; his person is inviolate; he is entitled to all honors, and enjoys many rights and privileges. According to Shatapatha Brahmana, Brahmans are the gods who have learnt the Vedas and chant them; they are human gods. The chief duty of a Brahman is to study and teach the Vedas; to perform sacrifices, yajnas, and other religious functions. All the asterisms (q.v.) are classified according to the four castes to indicate their nature, duties, and general influence. Asterisms classified as Brahmans are Krittika, Purva Phalguni, Purvashada, and Purva Bhadrapada. BRIHASPATI A Vedic deity and preceptor of gods; the planet Jupiter. BRIHAT SAMHITA :A celebrated work of astrology by Varaharnihira (A.D. 505-576). The term Samhita means 'compilation, and Brihat Samhita (Major Compilation), encyclopedic in its contents' deals with almost every subject even remotely connected with predictive science. It includes detailed chapters on astrological, seismological, sexual, and psychological subjects. It also dwells upon portents, market fluctuations, gems and precious stones, palmistry, physiognomy and worship of stellar deities. The work is executed in superb poetic language. Al-Beruni, who came to India in A.D. 1030, translated the work into Arabic and introduced it to the Middle East and the West. During recent times, Dr.. Kern translated it in English and it is now available as translated and annotated by many Indian writers too. BUDDHA :The enlightened being who reveals to the world the way to Liberation, Nirvana. To become a Buddha, one has to break through the bondage of sense and personality to acquire complete perception of the Real Self and learn not to separate it from all other selves. (See also Buddha Siddhartha) BUDDHA SIDDHARTHA :The name given to Gautam, the prince of Kapilavastu, the son of king Suddhodhana. Gautam was born in 621 B.C. He left his father's palace to become an ascetic in 597 B.C., became a full Buddha on the full moon night of Vaisakha in 592 B.C. and entered Nirvana in 543 B.C. These dates are given differently by different traditions, though only with slight variations. Siddhartha was the most perfect of all mortal men that the world has even seen. Gautarn Buddha, the fourth of the seven Buddhas and seven Tathagatas, had the most powerful influence in spiritualising the world. He is considered the ninth avatara of the Hindus. (See The Light of Asia by Sir Edwin Arnold) According to Dr B.V. Raman, Gautam Buddha was born on 14 April 623 B.C. at about middday at Lat. 270 8' North, Long. 83 05' East, the planetary position of the epoch is given as Sun 290 Y; Moon 2000 45'; Mars 260 54'; Mercury 530 6'; Jupiter 110; Venus 60 12'; Saturn 240 36'; Rahu 860 54' and Lagna 116045'. Ayanamsa +140 16'. BUDDHI :Universal soul; mind. Cognition of sensations through the sense organs resulting from the interaction of mind (citta) which produces knowledge of the external world. It produces intuitive awareness either of the inherent qualities of an external object or higher spiritual laws and their operations, which are not perceived by consciousness. It is intuitive awareness, resulting from intonations of spiritual illumination. It functions like a mirror reflecting the spiritual, Atmic, messages. In the reverse process it filters the mundane experiences to comprehend the Atmic manifestation. In Sankhya philosophy, Buddhi is the second of the 20 elements involved in manifestation. Astrologically, the Moon reflects Buddhic consciousness and stands as a component of the higher triad, represented by Atma (Sun), Buddhi (Moon) and Manas or Citti (Mercury). BUDDH :Wise, intelligent. The planet Mercury, son of Soma, the Moon, Rohini or by Tara, who was a wife of Jupiter.

The sign is owned by Saturn; Mars is exalted here and Jupiter is debilitated: The Sun is enigmatic and troublesome in this sign. T. Subba Rao refers to Capricorn as the Creative Intelligence. The impulse from the sign leads the cosmos and human beings towards their destiny. Blavatsky relates the sign with the Occult Hierarchy, commissioned to 'create' man in a special mould. It is the task of the Fifth Hierarchy, the mysterious beings who preside over the constellation 'to inform the empty and ethereal animal form, and make of it the Rational Man'. (S.D. I., P. 279) She also states that the Dhyanis in India and Egypt were connected with the crocodiles and their abode was in Capricorn. (I b. p. 266) Capricorn is a mystical sign capable of producing selfishness as well as occult insight. CAPUT DRACONIS ;Rahu, the north node of the Moon. CARDINAL HOUSES :Angles kendms (sk); the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th house divisions in a horoscope. These are the most important houses in a chart, as they represent very significant aspects of an individual's life.

The 4th house division is related with general prosperity, mother, property, vehicles, and intelligence. The 7th house is related with marriage and sex as well as business partnership, social status and death. The 10th house deals with profession, career, livelihood, reputation and social interactions. Planets in cardinal houses, even if malefic, acquire auspicious significance making decisive impact on the individual's life. Their lordship by benefic planets is considered inauspicious unless the ruling planet is posited in a cardinal house itself. CAUDAD DRACONIS :Ketu , the southern node of Moon. CASUALBODY :Karana Sharira (sk); the cover for the seed of one's future incarnations. It is neither an objective nor a subjective body, but the direct cause of the Sushupti (q.v.) condition, leading to the Turiya (q.v.) state, the highest state of Samadhi (q.v.). It is called Karanopadhi, or the causal sheath, which, according to Taraka Raja Yogis, is the repository of all causes of phenomenal existence. In the Vedanta system, it corresponds to Vijnanamaya and Anandamaya sheaths combined together, the latter comes next to Atma and is thus the vehicle of the Universal Spirit."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 187Blavatsky states that Buddhi alone cannot be called the causal body but it becomes so in conjunction with Manas (q.v.), the incarnating entity, or the ego. CHAKRA :Circle, disc-the perfect symbol of the cosmos. It refers to the natal chart depicting distribution of planets in different houses. In spiritual literature, chakras refer to the seven energy centers extending from the spinal cord to Etheric Double (q.v.), astral body and to other invisible counterparts of the human aura.

CHART, NATAL :Commonly known as jamna Kundah; depicts planetary positions at the time of birth. For preparing it, the ecliptic (q.v.) is divided into 12 divisions. The zodiacal sign rising at the time is known as ascendant or the 1st house; the zenith represents the 10th house; the western horizon is the 7th house; and the nadir is the 4th house.

It is applicable when the lord of the 10th house is located in the 10th house itself. The planetary ruler ship under this system is worked out by counting the birth asterism from Swati (q.v.) and dividing the number obtained by 7, the remainder will indicate the planetary ruler ship in the following sequence: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Each planet rules for 12 years. The balance at birth of the first ruling planet depends upon the distance traversed by Moon at birth in the asterism. The number obtained as the remainder indicates the order of the planet in the sequence given above. CHATURTHAMSA :Fourfold division of a zodiacal sign, each consisting of 70 30'. The deities presiding over the four divisions are Sanak, Sanandan, Sanat, and Sanatan, respectively. The planetary ownership of these divisions belongs to the sign lord for the first division, the lord of the 4th sign from it rules over the second division, the lord of the 7th sign from it over the 3rd division, and the lord of the both sign over the 4th division."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 189CHATUR-VARNA :The four castes according to the code of Manu, viz., Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaisya, and Sudra. Brahmin is the sacerdotal and learned class, the members of which may be, but are not necessarily, priests. Kshatriya is the regal, and the warrior caste. Vaisya is the trading and agricultural caste. Sudra serve the other three castes in meeting their individual requirements, while the other three serve the society as a whole. CHATURVISHAMSA :Also known as Siddhamsa. It refers to the 1/24th division of a zodiacal sign. CHHADAKA :That which conceals or covers. Full Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and Ketu are Chhadakas for the 2nd and 12th houses from them. Jupiter owning a malefic house and becoming a malefic to the native becomes a Chhadaka for only the 12th house; others thus placed are Chhadaka for the 2nd house only. In another sense, a planet in 2nd from a Bhava (q.v.) is Chhadaka for that Bhava while that in 3rd is called Vedhaka, that which is placed in 4th is Bandhaka and the planet in the 8th house is Pratibandhaka. CHHATRA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all planets situated in the first seven houses of the chart. It makes the individual very happy from the beginning of his life till the very end. CHHAYA :Shadow. The shadowy body of the wife of Sun, Sanjna, kept by her to attend to the needs of her husband while she herself was away on a visit to her father's place. From Chhaya were born Saturn, Savrni (a Manu), Tapti (a river), and Visthi (a son). CHITRA :The 14th asterism extending from 1730 20' to 1860 40' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Mars; its presiding deity is Tvastra, the celestial architect. Its primary motivation arises from Kama, desire; and its basic attribute is Tamas, inertia. It is classified a farmer by caste, a tiger by species, a demon by temperament, and a human by animal type. The asterism is concerned with west direction. It leads to involvement in Mayavic (illusory) existence, but for spiritually advanced individuals the asterism makes them highly creative, enabling them to produce original artifacts. The asterism is symbolised by a pearl. CHITRA BHANU :The 16th in the cycle of 60 Samvawtsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Brahma. Birth during this year makes the individual brilliant, proud, devoted to gods; but he, sometimes, indulges in dishonourable activities. CITTA :(pronounced Chitta, Ch as in Champion). Abstract consciousness; mind. One of the three aspects of consciousness, the other two being Sat, truth, and Ananda, bliss. In Vedanta, these three are considered the three aspects of the primeval unity, & three aspects of Sachchidananda, the Supreme Spirit. The self-existent and self-sufficient Sat, due to its latent tendency of polarisation, differentiates itself as Self and Not-Self. The Self-expressed as Not-Self is said to be Citta and that which relates the two is Ananda. Yoga aims at restoring the unity between the two-Self and Not-Self. In astrology Moon represents the Citta aspect of the consciousness. It reflects the attribute of Sat, represented by the Sun; it establishes a relationship between the object or the mundane activities of the individual and his central subjective core, the Sun. COMBUSTION :Destruction by planetary influence. The general effect of a planet destroyed by its close proximity to the Sun is known as combustion. The extent of closeness for it differs for different planets, as it is given as follows: ± 120 for Moon; ± 140 for Mercury; but if Mercury is retrograde, the distance of only ± 120 between Sun and Mercury is applicable; ± 100 for Venus, but if it is retrograde, only ± 80 is applicable; for Mars it is ± 170, but only ± 80 in retrogression. To be combust with the Sun, Saturn should be within a range of ± 150 from it. The nodes are never combust. There is no uniform acceptance of these magnitudes. The combustion of a planet is neither an unmitigated evil, nor does it completely obliterate its special features. In the case of Moon, this relationship spoils the sensitivity of the individual. A combust Venus destroys marital happiness. Jupiter conjunct makes the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 190individual profane, and transgressing well established social norms. Saturn debases the nature of Sun. Rahu, when closely associated with the Sun, leads to several perversions and dishonorable behavior. When Mars is associated closely with the Sun, the individual is filled with great enthusiasm and is capable of performing many chivalrous deeds. CONJUNCTION :Any two planets situated together in a house. Combustion refers to the relationship between Sun and the other planets, whereas conjunction is a general term applicable to any two planets. Various astrological combinations, known as Yogas (q.v.), are formed by such combinations, which have special results. Thousands of such combinations have been identified in classical/Vedic astrology. COSMIC ASTROLOGY :Sidereal astrology. Its zodiacal signs are fixed stellar constellations. It establishes relationships between our solar system, the fixed stars and the galaxy. Cosmic astrology possesses very accurate (occult) predictive base and provides a sound basis for spiritual astrology. It reveal ' s many deeper aspects of an individual's life. COSMOGONY :A theory of the origin and development of the universe. Cosmology deals with the philosophy of the origin and general structure of the universe with its parts, elements, laws, and such of its characteristics as space, time, causality and freedom. It forms a branch of astronomy that deals with the general structure and evolution of the universe. Astrology provides a bridge between the philosophical aspect of cosmology and the impact of cosmic forces on human and terrestrial events at their deeper levels. CUSP :The central point in a house division where a planet exerts its maximum impact. DAITYAS :Titans; Descendants of Diti, a daughter of Daksha, and Kashyapa, a Prajapati (q.v.) and grandson of Brahma. Daityas were a race of demons and giants who lived in Sutala, which according to the legends, is one of the 14 lokas (q.v.). They were gigantic in form and were moved by intense sensual passion. Yet they were greatly devoted to their deities, followed Vedic rituals, undertook severe penance, and offered incredible offerings to them. Hiranyakashipu, Prahalad, Ravana, Sishupala, Virochana and Bali were some renowned daityas. Very often, the daityas were at war against the gods and interfered with their religious ceremonies; they were often victorious and the gods had to invoke divine dispensation to wrest back power. The daityas cooperated with the gods in churning the ocean to obtain the nectar from it, but the gods did not wish to share it with them. Rahu and Ketu (q.v.) surreptitiously mingled with the gods and partook a bit of it, which made them immortal. Esoterically, daityas represent resistance to spiritual forces; they enable externalization of latent faculties. In this way, they represent the opposing power required to maintain natural equilibrium and harmony. Demon est deus inverses (Daityas are gods inverted). According to Blavatsky, the daityas are demons in an adverse sense; in truth, they are identical with certain asuras (q.v.) the intellectual gods and opponents of meaningless rituals. They are antagonizing, blind forces in nature, expressed as reaction, opposition, and contrast, evil for some, good for others. Psychologically, they play an important role in discovering the concealed psychological weaknesses of neophytes before they qualify for Initiation (q.v.) in hidden mysteries. DAKSHA :Able; competent; intelligent; skilled. The Puranic being who represents creative power, a form of Brahma. He is described in detail, in almost every religious treatise in India. These descriptions often elude the readers unless the esoteric references are well understood. The Rig Veda makes Daksha spring from Aditi (q.v.) and Aditi from Daksha. To ' explain it, Roth made Aditi as eternity, and Daksha represented the spiritual power, the male energy which generates gods in eternity.The Shatapatha Brahmana identifies Daksha with Prajapati, the creator. He is considered to be a son of Brahma, one of the mind born offsprings, and is regarded as their chief. On another occasion, he is regarded to be a son of Aditi, one of the Adityas (q.v.) and also reckoned among the Vishwadevas (q.v.)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 191The Mahabharata makes Daksha spring from the right thumb of Brahma, and his wife from his left. Almost every Purana gives important status to Daksha in human evolution. The names of his wife are variously given, e.g., Prasuti, who was a daughter of Priyavrata, and granddaughter of Manu. Daksha married Virini when he took birth as a son of Prachetasa and Marishi; Asikni, a daughter of Panchjanya, is also said to be his wife, from whom he produced 10,000 sons. From Prasuti, Daksha had, according to various statements, 25, 50, or 60 daughters, the last being the most extensively held view. Of these, ten married Dharma, thirteen Kashyapa, from whom were born gods, demons, men, birds, serpents, and all living beings. Twenty-seven of Daksha's daughters were married to Soma, Moon, and these became the asterisms (q.v.). One of the daughters of Daksha, Sati, was married to Shiva who immolated herself at her father's yajna when due honor was not accorded to her husband, and this led to a catastrophe and Daksha's head was severed and thrown into the fire, but later replaced by that of a ram. The other daughters of Daksha were married to Aristnemi, Bhrigu's son Venus, Krishashva, and Angira. In another Manvantara, when Daksha was born as a son to Prachetasa, he had seven sons, viz., Krodha (anger), Tamas (sloth, inertia), Dama (self control), Vikriti (distortion), Angiras (a Vedic sage), Kardama (sin), and Ashwa (a horse, a horse like human race, and the number seven). According to Blavatsky, the various stories about Daksha make him a personification of creative forces acting on all planes. He has spiritual power and, according to her, a male form of energy that generates gods in eternity. DAKSHINA SAMPATA :Autumn equinox. DAKSHINAMURTI :An aspect of Shiva. A mystic functionary situated, according to legends, around the Tropic of Capricorn, and guiding the influx of spiritual forces to earth. The nodes of Moon are said to be intimately connected with him. DAKSHINAYANA :The beginning of the southward sojourn of Sun after the summer solstice. DAM YOGA :See Sankhya Yoga. It makes the individual sharp witted, rich, and renowned. DAMARU :A small hour glass shaped drum like musical instrument which produces sound when twisted by the wrist. Two strings are attached to its middle, which, when shaken, strike at both the ends producing sound. A damaru is generally held by Kapalikas, the mendicants who hold a skull in their hand; the jugglers make use of it to make captive monkeys and bears dance to its rhythm. Its religious significance arises from the belief that Lord Shiva holds a damaru in one of his hands. In this context the damaru symbolizes time and rhythmical cosmic movement to its musical accompaniment. A damaru represents many aspects of Cosmo genesis: sound released from void makes manifestation possible; polarization of a point leads to duality, involution and evolution, subjective and objective manifestation, in the direction above and below. The polarization further leads to triangularisation, making trinity to emerge and thenceforth further creative impulses are generated. DANAVA :Demons. DANDA YOGA :An auspicious planetary combination formed in several ways. If Venus aspects Jupiter placed in the 3rd house, while the lord of the 3rd is in exaltation, Danda Yoga is formed. Alternatively, it takes place when all planets are placed only in Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces signs. Danda Yoga makes a person respected, very rich, an able administrator, and a pious person. An inauspicious combination under the name is formed when all planets occupy only the 10th, 11th, and 12th houses; it makes the individual depraved, dependent on others for livelihood, and discarded by his kith and kin."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 192DARIDRA YOGA :Planetary combination producing indigence and personal infirmities. Many such combinations are given in astrological texts. Some of the important ones are mentioned below: (i) Jupiter as lord of the 8th house or the 1st house exceeds the strength of the lord of the 9th house, and the lord of the 11th house is neither placed in a cardinal house nor is combust. (ii) Debilitated and combust Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, or Mercury occupies the 11th, 6th, 12th, 8th or the 5th Bhava. (iii) Saturn in 9th house aspected by malefic planet(s) while Mercury is associated with the Sun and occupies the Ascendant and has Pisces Navamsa. (iv) Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Mars occupy in any order 8th, 6th, 12th, 5th, and 10th Bhavas, and the lord of the 12th house, weakened by Sun's aspect, has greater strength than the Ascendant lord. (v) Depressed Venus, Jupiter, Moon, and Mars occupy any four of the 1st, 10st, 11th, 6th, 7th , and 8th Bhavas. (vi) Venus in Ascendant in its debilitation sign, while Jupiter, Mars, and Moon are also in debilitation. (vii) The ascendant is in a cardinal sip, while the rising Navamsa is aspected by Saturn and depressed Jupiter. (viii) In the above combination (No. vii) even if Jupiter is in the 6th or the 8th Bhava in a sign not belonging to itself, the same result follows. (ix) Ascendant in a fixed sign, malefic in cardinal and trine houses in strength, and angles devoid of benefices make the individual to subsist on alms. (x) Night time birth, ascendant in a cardinal sign, weak benefices occupy angles and trine, and malefic not in cardinal houses will make the individual absolutely poor. (xi) Debilitated malefic will make the individual indulge in unethical acts, but debilitated benefices will succeed in keeping his sins concealed; Jupiter for Aries ascendant posited in the 10th house, or Mars for Pisces in the 5th will make the individual lead a disgraceful life Persons born in Daridra Yoga suffer deprivations of different intensities and meet unlucky and trying conditions of life. Their sorrows arise not only from indigence; their organs may be defective, their nature may be crafty, their speech unpleasant and they may be addicted to lust and gluttony. They earn by foul means. Their social life is dishonourable. They meet unexpected failures in life. DARSHAN :Sight; understanding; intellectual insight; a system of philosophy. Six systems of Indian philosophy, or Shad Darshan. These are based on the assumption that nothing comes out of nothing ex nihilo nihil fit so there is a beginning, and all have one and the same ultimate destiny, the emancipation of the soul from future births and existence, and its absorption into the Supreme Soul. The Shad Darhsan reaches these conclusions through different paths of intellectual enquiries, viz., Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Sankhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa, and Uttar Mimamsa. Nyaya, associated with Vatsyayana, is a system founded by Gautam. The word Nyaya means propriety, justice, appropriateness of conclusions. The school under this name is also called the Logical School. It refers more to the appropriateness of methodology rather than to its subject matter. It is also said to represent the sensational aspect of Hindu philosophy, because it has more pointed regard to the five senses than the other systems have and treats these external manifestations more frankly as a solid reality. Dowson considers it as the esoteric school, as the Vedanta is the esoteric. It aims to establish the nature of the Absolute, purely based on logic and reasoning. Vaiseshika was founded by Sage Kanada. He was a contemporary of Gautam. This school is supplementary to Nyaya. The two are often classed together. It assumes fewer predicables of the Absolute and lays special emphasis on specialities (Vishesa, the term to which the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 193system owes its name, means special). It bases its approach to the Ultimate on the atomic theory of the universe. It teaches the existence of a transient world composed of aggregation of eternal atoms, an endless number of souls, and a fixed number of material principles. Their correlation and interaction of primordial cosmic evolutions take place without any directing force. They operate by a mechanical law inherent in the atom. It is a very materialistic approach to the manifest existence, yet it recognizes a Supreme Being. Sankhya, literally 'relating to number', is based on the teachings of Sage Kapila. It discourses on numerical categories and the 25 tattwas representing the forces of nature in various degrees. It explains the integration of 24 elements with Purusha, the Spirit, modified by the three gunas, viz., sattwa, rajas, and tamas; teaching the eternity of Pradhana, primordial homogeneous matter; the self transformation of nature; and the eternity of human Egos. Sankhya and Yoga are often classed together, but Sankhya seems atheistical while Yoga is manifestly theistical. Sankhya's chief goal is to establish the way to final emancipation which can be accomplished by release from the attributes and tattwas leading to the emancipation of Purusha or Soul from the fetters of phenomenal existence. A true understanding of the relationship between Purusha and Pradhana leads to the release. Yoga, popularly associated with Patanjali, is the doctrine which owes its origin to still an earlier sage, Yajnavalkya, the writer of Satpatha Brahmana of Yajur Veda, the Brihad Aranyaka, and other famous works. Yoga aims at unification of an individual with the Supreme Spirit and at control of the modification of the mind in order to attain self realisation. It lays down the eightfold path to the final attainment of Nirvikalpa Satiiadhi, when the separation of the individual is eliminated and the yogi realizes his identity and merges in the Supreme. Tremendous psychic powers are attained during this unfolding, or self-realization. Purva Minimamsa was founded by Jaimini and Uttara Minimamsa is associated with Bhadrayana Vyasa. Uttara Mimamsa is also called Vedanta, whose most prominent apostle was Sankaracharya. The term Vedanta means the end, or goal, of the Vedas. Minimamsa means deep reflection, inquiry, investigation. The object of both these schools of philosophy is to teach the art of reasoning with the express purpose of aiding the interpretation of the Vedas, not only of the speculative but also of its practical portion. The principal doctrines of Vedanta are that God is the omniscient and omnipotent cause of existence, continuance and dissolution of the universe. Creation is an act of his will, and he is both the efficient and the material cause of the world. On consummation, all beings and things merge into him. He is the sole existent and universal soul, and besides him there is no second principle; he is adwaita, without a second. An important contribution, of Vedanta is the doctrine of Avidya, the Mayavic illusion, which blinds one to the reality of the Supreme Self. DASA :Also known as planetary direction. It refers to the system according to which planetary ruler ship at any specific period of one's life is worked out. It shows the time when effective results of any planet, according to its natal position, can be experienced. Parashara enumerated 42 such dasas. The specific system applicable to any horoscope depends upon special planetary combinations in the chart. The basic consideration in all these systems is Moon's natal position in an asterism. On this basis the cyclical order of the periodicity of planetary ruler ship is worked out. Each planet is assigned a certain number of years for its ruler ship, and this number differs from one system to another. The following are some of the extensively used systems: (i) Vimshottri: It has a total of 120 years, of which Sun is assigned 6 years; Moon, 10 years; Mars, 7 years; Rahu, 18 years; Jupiter, 16 years; Saturn, 19 years; Mercury, 17 years; Ketu, 7 years; and Venus, 20 years. This planetary sequence is adhered to in the system. The first dasa is of Ketu when Moon occupies the very beginning of the first asterism, viz., Ashwini."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 194(ii) Ashtottri: It has a total duration of 108 years. In this system, Sun has a duration of 6 years; Moon, 5 years; Mars, 8 years; Mercury, 17 years; Saturn, 10 years; Jupiter, 19 years; Rahu, 12 years; and Venus, 21 years. There is no rulership for Ketu under this system. (iii) Shodashottri: It has a complete planetary chain of 116 years. (iv) Dwadashottri system has a total of 112 years. (v) Panchottri has a complete cycle of 105 years. (vi) Shatabdika has a planetary chain of 100 years. (vii) Chaturashitisama dasa has a planetary chain of 84 years. In all these dasas, Vimshottri dasa is the most widely accepted and used system. In certain parts of India Ashtottri dasa system is also employed to a limited extent. DASA CHHTDRA :The last portion of a planetary ruler ship. This duration is often inauspicious. DASAMAMSA :One-tenth division of a zodiacal sign' Each of it consists of 30 with different planets ruling and different Vedic deities presiding. DATA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by Jupiter in ascendant, Venus in 4th house, Mercury in the 7th, and Mars in the 10th house. It makes an individual very affluent and generous. DATTAKA PUTRA/ POSYA PUTRA :Adopted child. DEBILITATION :Also known as Neecha. It represents the weakest position of a planet. At this position the auspicious effects of the planet are eliminated unless cancelled by Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga (q.v.). The planets are debilitated as follows: Sun in Libra, 100; Moon in Scorpio, 30 Mars in Cancer, 280 Mercury in Pisces, 150; Jupiter in Capricorn, 50; and Venus in Virgo, 270; and Saturn in Aries, 200. Debilitation of a planet occurs 1800 away from its exaltation point. DECANATE :One-third portion of a zodiacal sign, equal to 10' each. DECLINATION Kranti . The angular distance of a heavenly body from the celestial equator measured on the Great Circle, or Meridian, passing through the Celestial Pole and the body. Declination of stars changes very slowly due to the effects of the precession of equinoxes whereas that of a planet changes markedly over a short period. DEEPTAMSA :Range of an expecting planet; the focal point of an expecting planet; the orb within which the aspect of a planet can be effective. The 7th house aspect of a planet means transference of its influence to the 7th house from which the planet is situated. It implies transference to the entire range of 300 of the house. In actual practice, it is not so. A planet placed towards the end of a sign does not effectively aspect a planet located towards the beginning of the seventh sign from it, though it is generally stated to be doing so. Deeptamsa indicates the area of maximum impact of an expecting planet. It is 150 for the Sun, 120 for Moon, 80 for Mars, 70 for Mercury, 90 for Jupiter, 70 for Venus, and 90 for Saturn. The area of maximum impact extends over 1800 ± Deeptamsa. DEHAM :A term used in Kala Chakra Dasa (q.v.). If differs for different quarters of an asterism. (Different related concepts are described in detail under Kala Chakra Dasa) DESCENDANT :The house opposite to ascendant. It represents the western direction in the sky, the region where the planets set down the horizon. In predictive astrology it represents the 7th house. DESHANTAR :Longitude. DETRIMENT :Position of a planet opposite to the sign of its ruler ship. DEVARISHIS Also known as Devarshis. The sages of the highest order. Either they are mind born sons of Brahma, e.g., Narada, or those who have, by their austerities, attained the exalted status of demigods. They dwell in the region of gods."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 195DEVAS :Shining ones. Gods dwelling in Indra's kingdom. DEVAVIDYA :Divine wisdom. A term used by Narada (q.v.) which he included among the various subjects when he told Sanat Kumar what he had learnt to prove his preparedness/eligibility for receiving further instructions from him. The nine subjects mentioned on this occasion, besides the Vedas, were history (including Puranic stories), grammar and philosophy (Nirukta), the knowledge of helping the Pitras (q.v.) and ancestors, mathematics, the science of manifestation, the knowledge of hidden wealth (Nidhi), logic and debate, ethics and Devavidya. The last implied either the secret of existence and functioning of 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, 12 Adityas, vidyuta (electricity), and the gods of the oblations of yajnas totaling 23, or the working of these gods which refers to the laws and their operations relating to physical sciences. DEVATA :A divine being; god. Devata includes many grades of celestial beings from the highest cosmic powers to a large number of beneficent inferior nature spirits. DEVA YONI :Of divine birth. A general name for those who belong to the realm of gods. DEVENDRA YOGA A planetary combination formed by ascendant placed in a fixed sign, ascendant lord in 11th, the lord of 11th in ascendant, and the lords of 2nd and 10th houses in mutual exchange. This combination is powerful in making the individual extremely beautiful (handsome like Indra), loved by pretty women, owner of vast wealth and villas. He attains a very high social status. DEVI :The female cosmic power. She is worshipped both in her mild forms (i) representing Uma, the light; Gauri, the brilliant; Jagatmata, the mother of the world, and so on; and (ii) in her fierce forms such as Chandika, the fierce; Durga, the terrible, or the unconquerable; Kali, the black, and so on. Various names had been given to this power and it is worshipped for obtaining quick divine favors. DEVYANI :Daughter of Shukra (Venus), and wife of Yayati, a mythological king of ancient India. DHANA KARAKA :The planet producing wealth, viz., Jupiter. DHANAYOGAS :Planetary combinations for wealth. DHANISHTHA :The 23rd asterism extending from 2930 20' to 3060 40' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Mars and its presiding deities are the eight Vasus (q.v.). Its primary attribute is Sattwa. It is classified as a farmer by class, lion by species, aquatic by animal type, and demonic in temperament. It is associated with the eastern direction. It bestows occult attainments on those who are on the spiritual path, while for the men of the world, it leads to deprivation of material conveniences with a view to pushing them towards their egoic destiny. DHANU :Bow. The ninth sign of the zodiac, Sagittarius. It extends from 2400 to 2700 of the ecliptic. It is symbolized by a centaur, a mythical horse like creature with a human torso which holds a bow with an arrow on it pointing towards the sky. Sagittarius is the mysterious center of radiation for cosmic evolution with stored latent energy which is released gradually as and when humanity is prepared to absorb the same. This impulse entails much hardship inherent in the process but the corresponding spiritual advancement is also commensurate with the difficulties confronted. In Hindu scriptures, Arjuna, the hero of the Mahabharata, who is also known as Dhanvi, meaning one who holds the bow and the arrow, represents this phase of inner enfoldment. Dhanu, as a zodiacal sign is characterized as a male indicating its quality of taking positive action. It is considered a common sign (Dwiswabhava) which indicates its capability for dynamicism as well as remaining perfectly still, passive. It is fiery in element, fierce in temperament, and strong during the day. Its favorite haunts are mountainous regions."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 196Jupiter rules over it. It provides spiritual impulse for radical transformation. The sign produces a radical transformation in one's life, marked change in temperament, cataclysmic situation in one's pattern of living, and much widening of social relationships. The future of Sagittarius ascendants lies not in enjoyment of worldly pleasures but in discharging personal, household, and social obligations. Although they struggle throughout their life, they receive unexpected support as well. A part of their life is bright, the other very dark. The chief stimulus in their life comes from their Atman, the very core of their being represented by the Sun which is, however, still very far away. DHARMA :Moral code; religious rites; righteousness; that which holds together and protects from dissolution; one of the four major motivating impulses for living beings, the other three being Kama (desire), Artha (gains), and Moksha (liberation). The eldest of the Pandavas, Yudhishtra, the hero of the Mahabharata, as well as Yamaraja, the god of death, are also called Dharma. It is also the name of an ancient sage, sometimes classed among the Prajapatis, who married ten (according to some authorities, thirteen) daughters of Daksha and had numerous children. Wilson has stated that these children were manifestly allegorical, being personifications of intelligence, virtues, and religious rites. DHARMARAJA :Yama, the king of the dead. It is also a title of Yudhishtra, the eldest of the Pandavas (he is mythically stated to be a son of Yama). The two are also known as (merely) Dharina, to suggest them to be the embodiments of righteousness. DHARMAYOGA :A planetary combination constituted by the occupancy of Jupiter and Venus along with the lord of the 2nd in the 9th house. It makes the person very pious, fond of warfare, chivalrous, and the commander of an army. He also becomes rich and charitable. DHATA :Tenth in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Brahma. The individual born during this year becomes rich, materialistic, libidinous, interested in cattle breeding and wealth. He is often religious as well. DHRISHTA KETU :Names of certain Puranic kings, such as (i) a son of Dhrishta Dyumna, (ii) a son of Shishupala, king of Chedi, and an ally of the Pandavas, (iii) a king of Kekayas, also an ally of the Pandavas, (iv) a son of Satyadhriti, and (v) a son of Nriga. The name has no relationship with Ketu, the southern node of Moon. DHRUVA :Fixed; immovable; the pole star; the pole of any great circle; the stem of a tree. It refers to the axis on which the Earth rotates. It represents the North Pole, and is the centre of cosmic centripetal energy making the South Pole the centre of centrifugal force. In ancient mythology, Dhruva was described as an asura (q.v.). According to Vishnu Purana, the sons of Manu Swayambhuva were Priyavrata and Uttanpada. The latter had two wives; the favourite Suruchi was proud and haughty, and the second, Suniti, was humble and gentle. Suruchi had a son named Uttama, and Suniti gave birth to Dhruva. While quite a child, Dhruva was contemptuously treated by Suruchi, and she told him that her own son Uttama alone would succeed to the throne. Dhruva and his mother submitted, and he declared that he wished no other honors than such as his own actions should acquire. He was a kshatriya, traditionally engaged in selfless, creative activities intended for protecting the social order, both from internal disorder and external aggression. Aroused by his inner impulse he left the royal palace, met the Saptarishis, and learnt from them spiritual austerities. On being pleased with his penance, Vishnu touched Dhruva's forehead with his conch shell, a symbol of cyclical cosmic evolution and fixed him as the Pole Star. He has the patronymic Authanpada, and he is also called Grahadhara, meaning the stay, or the pivot, of the planets. The mystic significance of the Pole Star is described to some extent by H.P. Blavatsky. She stated that the seven Prajapatis (q.v.), charged with the task of evolving various root races are intimately linked with the Pole Star. The centenary impulses of the cosmic spark which"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 197produce various phenomena through cosmic forces arise from this central seat of inner spiritual power. She highlighted the Seven Regents who enclose within their circle the world of senses, and represented as the seven planets, the seven invisible spirits, the seven seers, and other centenary influences, all related with Dhruva. She emphasized that the visible Sun, Moon, planets, and stars derive their power not from the eternal sustainer of their luminous life which exists as it were behind all these phenomena but in their case strongly tethered to the central fountainhead, Dhruva, the Pole Star. The Vishnu Purana mentions that there are certain special radiations related with Dhruva. The four stars, viz., Agni, Mahendra, Kashyapa, and Dhruva, placed in the tail of Shishupala, the Ursa Minor, produce extraordinary results when viewed in a certain way. The sight at night of the Pole Star and of the Shishupala constellation is said to expatiate all sins committed during the day. According to a Puranic story, Vishnu was so pleased with Dhruva that having placed him in the sky, he blessed him as follows: O Dhruva! I bestow to you that tenacious status which transcends those of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, all asterisms, the Seven Regents, and all the gods wandering in the sky. Many of the gods exist for four yugas (q.v.), some for a Manvantara (q.v.) but to you I give the position for a Kalpa (q.v).* *[N.B. A Kalpa is equal to 1,000 Mahayugas, lasting for 4,320 million human years, which represent one day of Brahma.] DHUMA :Smoke; a meteor. A concealed planet whose position is worked out by adding four zodiacal signs (i.e., 4 X 300) and one asterism (i.e., 130 200) to the longitude of Natal Sun. Dhuma is a powerful but inauspicious malefic. DIGBALA :[Dig (direction) + Bala (strength, power)]. It refers to the strength of a planet acquired due to its location in a specific direction in a horoscope. It is worked out in several ways. According to one method, Jupiter and Mercury acquire full strength in the east (ascendant), Sun and Mars in the south (M.C., or the 10th house), Saturn in the west (descendant, or the 7th house), and Moon and Venus in the north (the 4th house). These positions bestow full scope to these planets to express their potential. They enjoy maximum directional strength in these places. Opposite to these directions, they obtain the minimal strength. According to another system, the Sun acquires maximum Dig Bala in the north (the 4th house) from Mars; Jupiter, in the west (the 7th house) from Mercury, or the east (the 1st house) in relation with Saturn, or the south in relation with Venus and Moon. There are some other variations in the above rule. Varahamihira gives Dig Bala to various Bhavas (q.v.). If the 7th (west or the descendant) Bhava is occupied by a reptile sign, i.e., Scorpio, its Dig Bala is full. A biped, e.g., Gemini, Virgo, Libra, first half of Sagittarius or Aquarius, gets their directional strength in full; in 1st house in relation to the ascendant. Watery signs such as Cancer and Pisces have their full Dig Bala in 4th or the north, and the quadrupeds, viz., Aries, Taurus, Leo, second half of, Sagittarius and the first half of Capricorn attain full Dig Bala in 10th or the south. DIGNITIES :Status of a planet. It is of two kinds, viz., Naisargika, the inherent, and Tatkalika, the accidental. Lordship of a sign, or exaltation of a planet bestows to it inherent dignity while its occupancy of a mundane house, such as the cardinal, trine, etc., provides it temporary dignity. Planets situated close to the cusp of 1st, 10th, and 7th houses are temporarily dignified. Houses congenial to the nature of a planet, e.g., 4th house for Moon, 3rd for Mercury, 5th for the Sun, and 9th for Jupiter add dignity to them. DIKSHA :Initiation. Spiritual teaching imparted directly by a (qualified) teacher at a special mystical ceremony, revealing secret laws of nature. DIRECTION :According to Directional astrology, the timing of events likely to occur at different ages of an individual is worked out in a particular manner which is denoted by"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 198this term. It indicates the planetary ruler ship during a particular period in one's life when the special effects of the planet can be experienced. DIRECT MOTION :The normal direction of planetary movement. It is especially important to note the time when a planet assumes this direction at the conclusion of its retrogression. The change in direction is significant for predictive purposes. DISPOSITION :The planet which executes the will of another planet is known as its depositor. The ruler of the sign in which a planet is placed becomes the executor of the results of the former. For example, if Mars is located in Aquarius, then Saturn, the lord of Aquarius, becomes the 'depositor' of Mars. It implies that the directional period of Saturn (that is, during the Dasa period of Saturn) this planet will (also) produce the results normally expected from Mars in Aquarius. DITI :Cutting; splitting; division. A goddess or personification in the Vedas who is associated with Aditi (q.v.), and seems to be the antithesis to her. Aurobindo states that Diti, also called Danu, means division, and the obstructing powers or Vritras are her children, Danus, Danavas, Daityas, while Adit is existence in its infinity and the mother of gods. Diti had two powerful sons, viz., Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashyapu. The former was killed by Vishnu in the form of a wild boar, and the latter in the form of half lion and half man. Having lost her children, the Vishnu Purana describes how Diti begged Kashyapa for a son of irresistible prowess able to destroy Indra; she insisted on the sage fertilising her womb at dusk even if the time was not auspicious. Kashyapa asked her to control her emotions and await a favourable time, but Did was insistent. Her imploration was acceded tobut with a condition. Diti was asked to follow the rules of purity and observe the austerities for a period of hundred years, during which duration she should hold the foetus. She assiduously observed the conditions. But Indra knew of the approaching danger, so he went to her and attended upon her in great humility, watching for any slip on her part so as to destroy the foetus. One night, Diti retired to bed without washing her feet. This was a transgression and it gave an opportunity to Indra to destroy his impending adversary. With his thunderbolt he divided the foetus in her womb into seven portions. Thus mutilated, the child cried bitterly, and Indra being unable to pacify it, became angry and divided each of the seven portions into seven, thus forming 49 swift moving deities called Marutas. (Maruta comes from Ma-roditi meaning 'weep not’ which Indra is, supposed to have told the crying children to quieten them). Diti's son Hiranyakashyapu had a daughter named Sinhika, who was married to Viprachiti. He was the chief of the Danavas. They gave birth to Rahu, the north node of Moon. DREKKAN :One-third division of a zodiacal sign, equal to 100 each. In each sign, the first division is ruled by the lord of the sign, the second by the lord of the 5th sign from it, and the last by the lord of the 9th from it. The three presiding deities of various dekkans are Narada, Agastya and Durvasa. DRIG DASA :A system of planetary ruler ship (cf. Dasa System). It is specially adopted in Jaimini Astrology (q.v.). It is related with aspects of the sign from which it derives its name. The aspects under this system are decided according to Jaimini tenets for the same and the ruler ship of the signs refers to the ruler ship of the planets owning the sign. Under it, the 9th house gets the initial ruler ship, followed by the sign expected by it. The 10th house sign gets the next turn, followed by the sign expected by it. Subsequent ruler ships continue this order of sequence. Whether the signs are cardinal, fixed or common, it is important in deciding the forward or reverse aspect. Cardinal signs have reverse aspects while fixed signs aspect ahead. Odd common signs, e.g., Gemini and Sagittarius, aspect forward, and even common signs, like Virgo and Pisces, have reverse aspects."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 199With regard to duration, the lords of Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini, and Virgo get 9 years each; Capricorn, Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio get 8 years each; while Aries, Cancer, and Libra get 7 years each. DRIK BALA :Strength derived from planetary aspects. These are feeble within 3000 (i.e., two houses behind it) to 300 (i.e., one house ahead of it). The maximum strength is obtained at 1800 (the 7th sign ahead of it). The general rule is slightly modified in relation with Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. The differences in drik bala is also due to the planets half and three quarter aspects. Drik bala is full at 1800 and is nil at the sign in which the planet is situated; it is 25 per cent at 600 ahead, 75 per cent at 900 ahead, after which it declines to 50 per cent at 1200 and becomes nil at 1500. Between 1500 and 1800, the drik bala, or the Aspect Strength, gradually increases to the maximum. DRISHTI :Aspect . DURGA :The invincible; inaccessible; the wife of Shiva; an epithet of Parvati. The name Durga is derived from a special manifestation of her which occurred to restore the balance disturbed by the ravages caused by the demon Durgam. She succeeded in the insuperable task of subduing him. Durga is represented as the fierce aspect of the adorable goddess Lakshmi. She is represented with 8 hands and occasionally with 16 heads, and rides a tiger, which is at times represented as a lion. She possesses much tantric power. Blavatsky mentions that Durga, also known as Kali, who personifies the dark side of Lakshmi (the Indian goddess representing Venus), is the white side of Shakti. She is the feminine counterpart of the cosmic creative power. Devi Purana describes her as the primeval and mayavic power of Vishnu. She is known by many names such as Narayani, Sarva Shakti Swarupini, etc. She is said to radiate stability, intelligence, and final result of an action, hunger, thirst, compassion, humility, satiety, nourishment, understanding, peace, sleep, stupor, forgiveness, delusion, and grace. Durga is propitiated to overcome the afflictions caused by Rahu (q.v). Sorcerers and magicians worship her for obtaining supernatural powers. DURMATI :The 55th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsaras (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra (q.v.). Birth during this year makes the person possess a perverted mind, impatient, greedy, and engaged in undesirable activities. DURMUKH :The 30th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsaras (q.v.). It is ruled by Vishnu. Birth during this year makes the individual pious, peaceful, skillful, respected, and altruistic. He is, however, pursued by courtesans. DUSTHANAM :Inauspicious houses in a chart. These are primarily the 6th, 8th, and 12th houses which relate to litigation, death, and wasteful expenditure, respectively. DURUDHARA YOGAS :The name of planetary combinations constituted by planets situated on either side of Moon. They generally produce affluence such as wealth, comforts in life, and high social status. Sun and the nodes must not be involved in this combination. The specific planets which form this combination add their own special influence as well. If Moon is flanked by Mars and Mercury the combination makes the individual cruel, greedy, fond of old women, and a liar. Mars and Jupiter in the position make the individual renowned, clever, rich and a defender of others from adversaries. Venus and Mars make the individual fond of warfare, rigorous physical exertion, and courageous deeds, yet in personal life he will be sorrowful. He, however, will get a loving wife. With Saturn and Mars, the individual becomes an expert in sexual art, accumulates much money, indulges in a fast life, and is surrounded by enemies. The combination of Jupiter and Mercury bestows religiosity, knowledge of scriptures, all round affluence and renown. Mercury and Venus in the situation make the individual beautiful, attractive, affluent, courageous, and the recipient of high official status. Moon in between Saturn and Mercury enables the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 200individual to travel to different countries in pursuit of wealth. Such persons are respected by unrelated distant persons while his own relatives treat him with disdain. Jupiter and Venus make the individual patient, intelligent, balanced, and ethical; he acquires jewels, renown, and good administrative position. When Venus and Saturn form the combination, they enable the individual to acquire an aged wife from a respectable family; they make the individual skilled in many trades, loved by women, and respected by government officials. Saturn and Jupiter flanking Moon create much difficulties in the personal life of the individual; he is often surrounded by scandals, difficulties, and litigation, though from these he emerges unscathed. Whatever the variation in the planetary combination, Durudhara Yoga makes the individual endowed with much physical comfort, wealth, loyal helpers, and sincere followers, but towards the end in the individual's life there arises a strong impulse for renouncing the worldly possessions. DVAITA :A school of Indian philosophy which emphasises the duality of the original cause of manifestation, viz., Jivatma and Paramatma, Spirit and Matter, Life and Form, Day and Night, Dark and Light, etc. DVARA RASI Opening sign; a term used primarily in Jaimini Astrology. It represents the sign of initial dasa (q.v.) or the sign whose dasa is under consideration. DWADASHOTTRI SYSTEM A system of planetary direction applicable to persons born in Venus navamsa. It is calculated by counting the number of asterisms from that of birth to Revati, and dividing it by 8, the remainder indicating the ruling planet at the time of birth. The numerical denote the different planets; and the years of their ruler ship are assigned in a different manner from other dasa systems. The numericals for different planets and the years of their rulership are as follows: 1=Sun (7 years); 2=Jupiter (9 years); 3=Ketu (11 years); 4=Mercury (10 years); 5=Rahu (15 years); 6=Mars (17 years); 7=Saturn (19 years) and 8=Moon (21 years). The total duration of the planetary cycle under this system is 112 years. It has no ruler ship of Venus. The balance of planetary ruler ship at birth depends on the portion of asterism already elapsed at birth. DWADASA VARGEEYA BALA :A term which refers to planetary strength in a horoscope based on the planet's position in 12 main divisions of a zodiacal sign, viz., (1) Rasi, (2) Hora, (3) Drekkan, (4) Padmamsa, (5) Panchamamsa, (6) Shashtamsa, (7) Saptamsa, (8) Astanisa, (9) Navainsa, (10) Dasamsa, (11) Ekadasamsa, and (12) Dwadasamsa. Auspicious or otherwise nature of a planet depends upon the aggregate strength derived from the total of these positional strength. DWAJA :Flag; ensign; insignia; the organ of generation; a symbol of honor. In astrology, it stands for the south node of Moon, viz., Ketu. DWAJA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all the malefic placed in the 8th house and all benefices in the ascendant. Under this combination, a leader is born in this combination, unless Mercury acquires malfeasance, it is not fully formed. DWAPARA YUGA :The yuga immediately preceding the Kali Yuga. DWIRDWADASA :The interrelationship between two planets placed 2nd and 12th from each other. DWISWABHAVA :Common signs of the zodiac, viz., Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. DYUTA :Gambling. The 1st house in a horoscope indicates gambling and Rahu is the planet associated with gambling in general. EARTHY SIGNS :Zodiacal signs related with Earth element. These are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. EASARAPH :Also known as Musarifa. A term used in Horary Astrology. It refers to a planetary combination involving two swift moving planets in which the fast moving one has"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 201overtaken the slow moving one. If the forward planet is a benefic, final success, or fruition of the action is likely a malefic overtaking. A benefic will frustrate the efforts of the individual. If both the planets are malefic, the result will be inauspicious. ECLIPSES :The obscuration of the light of Sun by the intervention of Moon in between it and Earth is known as Solar Eclipse. Two solar eclipses must be visible every year in some part of the earth, the maximum number of it may go up to five. For a solar eclipse to occur, the New Moon must be very close to a node of Moon. Total solar eclipse occurs when the surface of Sun is completely obscured by Moon, but it is not very common. The track of total eclipse never exceeds 268.7 km in width, and the never lasts more than 8 minutes. The obscuration of the light of Moon by the intervention of Earth in between it and Sun is known as Lunar Eclipse. Under its impact Moon becomes dim until it passes out of the shadow. Moon does not completely vanish, as the shadow of Earth does not completely preclude Sun's light from falling on it, due to the refraction of Sun's rays on it by Earth's atmospheric mantle. A lunar eclipse can be total or partial. Its duration can be no longer than 3 hours 40 minutes, the totality occurring only for 1 hour 40 minutes. The significance of eclipses is great in mundane astrology. The Tantrics and black magicians make special preparations during such eclipses for fulfilling their special occult objectives and for the preparations of their special charms. ECLIPTIC :The Great Circle formed by the intersection of the plane of Earth's orbit around Sun. It is the apparent path of Sun in the sky during the course of a year, In the geocentric system, which is generally adopted in all astronomical (and astrological) studies, this path is inclined to the Celestial Equator at an angle of 230 27. The inclination changes imperceptibly and is related to a cycle of 26,000 years. This variation, which is in between 210 59' and 240 36' is known as the Obliquity of the Ecliptic. All planets, constellations of the zodiac, and asterisms move, more or less, within a region of 80 on both sides of the solar trajectory making the total width of approximately 160 around the ecliptic for their annual movement. The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect at two points, viz., points of spring, or vernal, and autumnal equinoxes. These points are relevant for determining the precession of equinoxes on the basis of which the difference between tropical and sidereal zodiacs is worked out. EGO :Self; the unified triad comprising Atma Buddhi Manas, or the duad formed by Atma Buddhi. The immortal part of man which reincarnates as man-I am I, or the feeling of I am ship. Esoteric philosophy teaches the existence of two Egos in man, the mortal, or the physical, and the Higher, or the Divine and Impersonal, calling the former 'personality' and the latter 'individuality'. EKAWALI YOGA :The planetary combination in which all planets occupy different houses in a sequential manner. It makes the individual an emperor. ELEMENTS :See Tattwas. EQUATION OF TIME :The difference between true and mean time at any given moment. This difference arises due to Sun not always crossing the Meridian at 12 o' clock by watch. The time by watch is regulated by mean solar time, which is constant in length, and is equal to the annual mean of the true solar days. In working out a natal chart for predictive purpose, the true position of the planets is taken into account. It needs readjustment of the mean time on the basis of the equation of time to arrive at the true time. The ephemeris generally indicates the different true and mean midday times, which determine the equation of time. True solar time is worked out on the basis of this equation. EQUINOCTIAL POINT :Sampat Bindu (sk); the points of intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic. Each point refers to the Sun's crossing of the celestial equator, and is known as Equinox. On this day, night and day are equal all over the world. One of these"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 202is known as the Vernal Equinox, which occurs around 21 March every year, and the other as Autumnal Equinox, which occurs around 21 September. Astrologically, Sun's rays acquire a positive impulse after vernal equinox and auspicious activities can be fruitfully initiated and beneficial results expected. FEMININE SIGNS :Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces are feminine signs. Feminine asterisms are Krittika, Rohini, Mrigashirsha, Aridra, Punarvasu, Purva Phaiguni, Hastha, Chittra, Vishakha, Anuradha, Dhanistha, Shatbhisag, Uttara Bhadrapada and Revati. Feminine signs and asterisms are related with the material aspect of life as distinguished from the spiritual aspect of it. Among the planets, Moon, Venus, and Ketu are considered feminine; Mercury and Saturn are neutrals (or eunuchs). Feminine planets need active support of other planets to produce their inherent results. Feminine signs and asterisms as well as planets have their masculine counterparts, in whose association they prosper easily and harmoniously FIERY SIGNS :Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are fiery signs. Sun and Mars are fiery planets. They show courage, strength, determination, aggression and confidence in oneself. FIXED SIGNS :Sthira Rasi (sk). Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius are fixed signs. These signs radiate deep acting impulses when planets are posited there, they make decisive impact on the life of the individual. FIXED STARS :Nakshatras . FOHAT :A Tibetan term representing in the universe of manifestation the ever present electrical energy and nonstop destructive and formative power. It is analogous to the Vedic concept of Agni, fire. Agni, in the Vedas, is always represented in the double aspect of force and light. It is the divine power that builds up the worlds; it is a power that acts always with perfect knowledge; it knows all forms and activities of divine wisdom. Similarly, Fohat is said to be the universal propelling vital force, at once the propeller and the resultant. Often it is said to be equivalent to the Vedic Mool Prakriti, the primeval root for all cosmic manifestation. Theosophists use Fohat to represent the active male potency of Shakti (q.v.), the female reproductive power in nature. The energy expressed by Fohat becomes important in interpreting the deeper aspects of solar impulse. FORTUNA, PARS :A term (probably) of Arabian origin. It was known even to Ptolemy. It is an imaginary point in heaven yet considered sometimes powerful as the luminaries. Pars Fortuna is worked out by adding together the longitudes of Ascendant and the Moon, and subtracting from the total the longitude of Sun. The resultant is the longitude of Pars Fortuna. This concept itself may not be available in ancient Indian astrological texts, but the essential features of it were known to the astrologers. The identity of Pars Fortuna, in terms of Vedic astrology, can be established as follows: Paras Fortuna =A+M-S=F where A is the Ascendant, M is the longitude of Moon, S, the longitude of Sun, and where F is the longitude of Pars Fortuna. The equation can also be written as F=A+T because T = M - S, where T stands for Tithi, or a lunar day. In this way, Pars Fortuna becomes a point in the horoscope as distant from the ascendant as the Sun is from Moon, measured from the ascendant. Traditional Hindu astrology regards Moon as important as the ascendant. Tithi is assigned a functional role as a magnetic point well established in traditional Vedic astrology. Pars Fortuna, in airy signs, bestows fame through literary or artistic activities. In earthy signs, it makes the individual laborious: in Taurus, it makes him work on fine arts; in Virgo, as a chemist or a printer; and in Capricorns, in medical profession. In watery signs,"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 203Pars Fortuna gives birth to successful occultists; and in fiery signs, the individuals become leaders and pioneers in different spheres of life. The results of Pars Fortuna in different houses are as follows: 1st House: Desire for self-expression and recognition of one's merit. 2nd House: Desire for power and domination over others. 3rd House: The person becomes a thinker. 4th House: Pleasant domestic environment. 5th House: Enterprising and meritorious offspring. . 6th House: Impatience and lack of self-control. 7th House: Happy married life. 8th House: Strained financial fortune. 9th House: Spiritual temperament. 10th House: The individual attains high official status. 11th House: Helpful and supportive friends and social circle. 12th House: Depression and frustration in mundane activities. FRIENDSHIP, PLANETARY Planetary friendship is of three kinds, viz., inherent, temporary, and aggregative. The first one depends upon the basic qualities of the planets, the second on their mutual relationships in the horoscope, while the third depends upon the resulting relationships emerging from the first two kinds and determining their aggregative strength. Planets according to Sage Satyacharya, are inherently friendly with the lords of 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 12th signs from their Mulatrikona (q.v.) or Trine houses, besides the lords of their exaltation signs. Any planet occupying 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, or 11th houses from it becomes its temporary friends. If a planet is situated along with another in any house, or if there is a planet in the 5 th, 6 th, 7th, 8 th, or 9th houses from it, such planets are treated as its temporary enemies. Aggregative relationship is classified under five categories, viz., very friendly, friendly, neutral, inimical, and very inimical. If two planets are friendly according to both the methods of classification, they are considered to be very friendly. If under one classification a planet is friendly with another but in the next becomes neutral, the two will be treated as only friendly. If according to one they are friendly, but inimical according to the other, they will be treated as neutrals. In case two planets are neutral according to one classification whereas under the next set of conditions they become enemies, they will be reckoned as enemies. If under both sets of conditions, two planets are neutral according to one classification whereas under the next set of conditions they become enemies, they will be reckoned as enemies. If under both sets of conditions, two planets are found to be unfriendly, they will be treated as very inimical. The, following table shows the generally accepted inherent or natural interplanetary relationships of friendship.

The friendly relations of Rahu and Ketu are not included in the table. Some texts mention Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn to be their friends. GADA YOGA :A planetary combination formed in two ways: W Moon posited in 2nd house along with Jupiter and Venus, or the lord of 9th house additionally aspects them; and (ii) all planets, excluding the nodes are posited in adjoining cardinal houses. Gada Yoga makes the individual engaged in philanthropic and religious activities but fierce in appearance and free from any enemy. He earns much money. He is also happily married. GAJA YOGA :A planetary combination in which the lord of the 7th house from ascendant, which would be 9th from the 11th house, is in the 11th house along with Moon, and the lord of the 11th house aspects them. A person born under this combination is always happy, rich, religious, and lives in luxurious style. His third decade in life proves to be very important. GAJA KESARI-YOGA :[Gaja = elephant, Kesari = lion, Yoga combination]. An auspicious planetary combination formed by certain relationships between Moon and Jupiter. It postulates that Jupiter must be in an angle (q.v.) from Moon or the ascendant; or that benefice such as Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury without being debilitated or combust, aspect the Moon. An alternative condition is that Jupiter in a quadrant from the ascendant or Moon is in association with or expected by benefices which are neither combust nor posited in the 6th house. The combination makes the individual bright, affluent, intelligent, accomplished and favored by the government. Gaja Kesari-yoga is both protective from evil consequences of other maleficent as well as productive of auspicious results. GANDANTA :The conjunction of Pisces and Aries, Cancer and Leo, and Scorpio and Sagittarius. GANESHA :[(Gana = inferior deity, or the masses) + (Isha = Lord)]. Also known as Ganapati. Son of Shiva and Parvati or of Parvati only. He is the deity invoked at the commencement of all auspicious activities; he is the supreme god of all educational activities, specially of those connected with divine wisdom. He is the god of wisdom and remover of all obstacles. He is one of the five primary deities (the other four being Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, and Durga) who are related with the five primeval elements, the Panch Mahabhutas . Ganesha is described as a short, fat deity of golden-yellow color with a protuberant belly, four hands, and the head of an elephant, which has only one tusk. In one hand he holds a conch shell, in another a discus, in the third a club or goad, and in the fourth a water lily. Sometimes he is depicted riding a mouse or attended by one. He is very fond of lidos. There are many legends about his birth, which makes him born only of Parvati, and which even explains his having an elephant head and only one tusk. According to one version, Ganesha sprang from the scurf of Parvati's body; he was created by her to guard the door while she went for a bath. Shiva, her consort, wished to enter the house but was opposed by Ganesha. An infuriated Shiva cut off Ganesha's head. Later on, to pacify a wailing Parvati he replaced it with an elephant's head. According to another story, when the gods assembled at the birth ceremony of Ganesha, Parvati, proud of her offspring, asked Sani (Saturn), disregarding the natural malefic effect of his glance, to look at him. Sani, when prodded, looked at Ganesha and his head was burn (to ashes. It created a turmoil and Parvati could not be consoled. Brahma however saved the situation by arranging to replace the head with the first one that could be found and that was an elephant's. Another version is that Parvati formed him to suit her own fancy. A further explanation is that Shiva slew Aditya, the Sun but restored him to life again. For this violence, Kashyapa cursed Shiva's son to lose his head, and when he lost it, the head of Indra's elephant was used to replace it."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 205Ganesha's elephant-head contains only one tusk, the other having been lost in a fight with Parasurama (q.v.). It happened so when the latter came to Shiva's abode at Mount Kailash but was stopped at the door by Ganesha who was deputed there to stop anyone from entering the sleeping chamber of Shiva. On being stopped Parasurama felt humiliated, as it is said that Ganesha wrapped him in his trunk. An angry Parasurama threw his axe at Ganesha. As the axe was given to the sage by Shiva himself, Ganesha received it with great humility lest its greatness was compromised, and permitted it to sever one of the tusks. Ganesha is also known as Aj, meaning 'unborn', an epithet for Aries (q.v.). He is said to be a brother of Kartikeya (q.v.), the presiding deity of Mars. [Ganesha is related to Sagittarius in a special way. While Sagittarius is represented as an animal body with a human head, Ganesha is depicted as a human body with an animal head, suggesting his inner preoccupation with cosmic manifestation transforming spirit into matter.] Dr. Rees gives another sea cance of Ganesha. He states Ganesha to be Indra's celestial elephant, Airavata, represented by Capricorn. (See Revelation in the Wilderness, vol. 11, p. 26) According to him, Ganesha watches the beginning of the spiritual path, he is the lord of karmic cause-and-effect, hence the binder and remover of obstacles. Ganapati, according to him, represents the manifested universe in his body, the unmanifested in his head. From another standpoint, Dr. Rees states that below his throat, Ganesha is one with Maya (q.v.), while his head represents Brahman. He associates Ganesha's mouse with Atman, the Divine Self. (See, Ibid., vol. I., p. 288) GARUDA :A mythical bird vulture-like-half-man, half-bird-on which Vishnu rides. According to Puranic stories, he is the chief of the feathered race and a staunch enemy of serpents. He is born of Sage Kashyapa and Vinata, one of the daughters of Daksha Prajapati. He has a white face, a beak-like nose, red wings, and a golden body. His lustre was so brilliant that soon after his birth, the gods mistook him for Agni (q.v.) and began worshipping him. Garuda had a son named Sampati, and his wife was Unnati, or Vinayaka Kadru, another wife of Kashyapa, and the mother of the serpent race, was Vinata's great rival. Once the two wives had a dispute over the colour of Indra's horse, Uchchaishravasa, said to have been obtained during the churning of the ocean. Vinata lost and as per the condition of the wager, she was made a slave of Kadru. She could regain her freedom only if Garuda could obtain the nectar. Garuda succeeded in stealing it from heaven but not without a severe fight with Indra, its custodian. Indra recovered the nectar, but he was worsted in the fight and his thunderbolt was smashed in the broil. Garuda's son Jatayu once tried to fly up to the Sun in the sky. This burnt his wings and he fell down. He awaited his death till Rama took birth in a successive yuga, and after giving him details of Sita's abduction by Ravana and her whereabouts, left his body. His last rites were performed by Rama. Jatayu had been a friend of Rama's father, Dasharatha. The friendship began from the time Dasharatha went to the ecliptic to recover Sita from Sani (Saturn). His carriage was consumed by a glance from Saturn but Jatayu caught the falling king and saved him. (See Dowson, p. 135) Blavatsky considers Garuda as a symbol of the Great Cycle representing the periodic rejuvenation of the universe. GHATIKA LAGNA :The Ascendant in the Indian system of horoscopy which is expressed in relation with the daily sunrise and sunset time described in traditional time counts such as ghati, pala, etc. (See Time) GAYATRI :A sacred Mantra (q.v.) of the Rig Veda which is ascribed to Sage Vishwamitra. It is at one and the same time, a prayer, an invocation, and a mantra, a creative sound vibration. It consists of three parts, viz., Maha Vyahritis, Gayatri Mantra proper, and Gayatri Sirah. The first one refers to \"Om bhuh, Om Bhuvah, Om Suvah, Om Mahah, Om Janah, Om Tapah, and Om Satyam.\" These are the seven spheres of existence. Gayatri Mantra alludes to \"tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo nah"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 206prachodayat.\" It means, We meditate upon the Divine Light of that adorable Sun of spiritual consciousness, which stimulates our power of spiritual perception. Gayatri Sirah consists of \"Om apo jyoti raso 'mrtam Brahma bhur bhuvah suvar Om\" meaning, Om is the Waters, Light, Essence, the Immortal Reality; the Physical, Intermediate and Heaven worlds is Om.\" A Brahmin is every aspirant seeking Truth, and Brahman, is enjoined to repeat the mantra during his morning, more importantly at dusk, and even during his midday meditations. Gayatri mantra is addressed to Aditya (q.v.), Savitri. Explaining the inner significance of this mantra, Dr. Rees states that Savitri forms an aspect of the Sun in the house, which Mercury rules on the Night-throne. Gayatri is a prayer for spiritual illumination. The mantra has 24 divisions, viz., Tat-Sa-Vi-Tur-Va-Re-Ni-Yam-Bhar-ghoh-De-Va-Sya-Dhi-Ma-Hi-Dhi-Yo-Yo-Nah-Pra-Cho-Da-Yat. These are said to be related with the 24 divisions of the soundboard of the veena, the musical instrument held by Saraswati (q.v.) who is said to be identical with Savitri. These are further associated with the 24 divisions of the path through the zodiac, and with the 24 vertebrae in the spinal column. The Gayatri mantra symbolises, according to Dr. Rees, the world of creation in its stages from midnight to morning, from morning to midday, from midday to evening, and from evening to midnight. (See The Revelation in Wilderness, Vol. 111, pp. 67-68) GEMINI :Mithuna . The 3rd sign of the zodiac which extends from 600 to 900 of the ecliptic. It consists of two bright stars, Castor and Pollux. They symbolise a twin. In Vedic astrology they represent a male and a female holding a mace and a harp in their hand. The sign is ruled by Mercury; it stands for divine creative energy activated by the polarisation of spirit and matter. Polarisation is an important feature of the sign. Gemini is an odd sign, classified as male by sex, hermaphrodite by temperament, airy by element, and fierce by nature. It is related with west direction. It is powerful during night. Its natural habitat is in gambling dens, pleasure haunts, and bedrooms. It imparts Mahat (q.v.), the thinking principle in its trine aspects. It activates both subjective and objective activities in its interactions. Blavatsky describes Gemini to be the stage corresponding to the ceasing of the androgynal union and the man evolving the woman out of himself as a separate entity. In Kala Purusha, the heavenly or the cosmic man, Gemini represents the neck, the upper portion of the chest and the shoulders. It stands for his courage, enthusiasm as well as the impediments and difficulties met on the evolutionary path. Gemini is considered as the bridge as well as the separating agent between spirit and matter. The synonyms of Gemini are Mithuna (the twin), Dwandwa (conflict, strife), Nriyugma (union of human kind), and such other terms pointing to the duality in life. GEOCENTRIC SYSTEM :The conception of the universe with Earth as its center. It is the system based on the pre-Galilean view of the stellar world. This unrealistic view is opposed to the Heliocentric System (q.v.) yet it does not much vitiate the validity of various astronomical coordinates, especially for their practical use. The present day Ephemeris's provide coordinates of stellar relationships as seen from Earth. With the knowledge of its limitations, the astrological findings do not need any adaptation and they do not lose their applicability. GOCHARA :The range of pasturage for grazing by the cattle; the transit or passage of a planet in relation with other planets during the course of their usual movement. At any moment of time, a planet's position is different from its natal position. This divergence requires to be taken into consideration for astrological predictions. This relationship with natal Moon, along with Sarvastaka Varga (q.v.) and astrological direction (q.v.) synchronized together indicate the precise nature of situation an individual may face due to any planetary influence."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 207GO-YOGA :The planetary combination formed by exaltation of the lord of the ascendant, and strong Jupiter placed in its Mool Trikona (q.v.) in association with the lord of the 2nd house. It makes the individual hail from an elite family and bestows upon him happiness, attractive appearance, and high social standing. GOLA-YOGA :One of the Sankhya-yoga . Persons born under it are poor, lazy, and idiots. GOLAI VRITA Circumference. GOLARDHA Hemisphere. GRAHA :Planets. In common parlance it refers to the effect of adverse planetary conjuncture. GRAHA, POURA :The nature of planets when they are in opposition to another planet. (See Graha Yudha) GRAHAYUDHA :[(Graha = planet) + (Yudha = fight) planetary warfare]. An astronomical phenomenon resulting from proximity between two planets. It affects their power to produce any result. The planets involved in this relationship are rendered unable to bestow their beneficence, and become inauspicious. Such a situation occurs when a planet other than Moon or the nodes (Rahu.or Ketu) is situated within 50 of the Sun. The planet so placed is considered Asthagatha or combust. When such a relationship takes place with Moon, it is known as Saniaagama, or combination. Any of the five nonluminaries within 50 of any other planet causes planetary warfare, or Graha yudiza, and one of the two involved in this relationship is said to be vanquished and the other is a victor. The victorious planet produces powerful auspicious effects, while the vanquished one becomes inauspicious. The house in which this phenomenon occurs is destroyed and the individual suffers throughout his life in respect to that Bhava (q.v.). There are five kinds of planetary warfare, viz., Bhedam, Ullekham, Amsumardhanam, Apasauyam, and Yuddham. Bhedain occurs when two planets are within 50 of each other though in different asterisms. When they are between 30 and 50 of each other located in the same asterism, they are in Ullekha yuddham. When such planets are within a distance of 10 to 30 of each other in the same asterism, the relationship is known as Amsumardlianam. If the planets are within one degree of the other, they are known as in Graha yuddham proper. If one of the two planets within 50 of each other is direct while the other is retrograde, they form Apasavya Yuddham. The effects of planetary warfare depends upon the conditions classified under Poura Graha, Akranta Graha, and Akrita or Yayee Graha. Poura Graha is a planet in a state of opposition to another. Akranta Graha is the overpowered, chased, or eclipsed planet. Akriti Graha is generally aggressive on the move. The Sun is Poura up to 11 a.m., Akranta at noon, and Akrita or feeble in the afternoon. Moon is always overpowered. Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn are always in opposition (Poura), while Mars, Venus, Rahu, and Ketu are always aggressive. The effect of Graha yuddha is conditioned by the mood of these planets as indicated above. A planet with earlier longitude is said to defeat the planet ahead of it. A planet in southern hemisphere is considered defeated. But Venus is always victorious. The planet with a fairly larger orb than the other becomes victorious. (See Brihat Samhita, Chap. XVII). GRISMAKRANTI :Also known as Dakshinayan Vibhu. Summer solistice. GULIKA :An invisible point considered as a son of Saturn; Mandi (q.v.) is Saturn's another son. Gulika and Mandi are sometimes said to be the same but this view is not universally accepted. Both of these are theoretical satellites, Upagrahas (q.v.), but the methods for determining their positions are different. Gulika assumes that one-eighth of the day and the night is ruled by the seven rulers of the weekdays, while the remaining one-eighth portion is not assigned to any planet. Each ruler"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 208is assigned a number according to its sequence in the week, i.e., Sun (1), Moon (2), Mars (3), Mercury (4), Jupiter (5), Venus (6), and Saturn (7). The duration of the day, if the birth is in daytime, and of the night, if the birth is in night, when divided by would indicate the duration of their rulership. The first rulership belongs to the planet ruling the day. The subsequent portions will be ruled by planets in the sequence as in weekdays. The period belonging to Saturn is the period belonging to Gulika. In case, the birth is in night, the first portion of the night does not belong to the planet of the day; it is ruled by the planet relative to the fifth day from the first day. For example, the first planetary rulership for Wednesday night will belong to Sun, and consequently Saturn's portion on this day will be the 7th portion, which will be the time for Gulika. Gulika produces good results in ,the 3rd, 6th, and 11th houses in a natal chart; in the 10th house it makes the person religious and devoted to austerities. The longitude of Gulika is worked out as in the case of ascendant, depending upon the time of birth after sunrise. GUNAS :The three primeval emanations of the Supreme Spirit, Sachchidananda, known as Sattwa (pure harmony), Rajas (pure creative impulse), and Tamas (primeval darkness, or the state of ultimate dissolution). Esoterically, they correspond to Vishnu Brahma, and Shiva, respectively, though for common people Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva represent them. Together known as Trimurti or Trinity, they represent the three qualificative attributes of the universe. These are the basic attributes or qualities of the phenomenal existence. According to Sankhya doctrine, matter, Prakriti, is nothing but a condition of perfect equilibrium of the three attributes, known as Triguna-Samyavastha (harmonious balance of triplicity). Taimini explained the three attributes as different modes of motion. These modes, for want of better words, he calls (i) the vibration which involves rhythmic motion of particles, (ii) the mobility which involves non-rhythmic motion of particles with transference of energy, and (iii) the inertia which involves relative position of particles. The discovery of equivalence and interconvertibility of mass and energy will, according to him, ultimately reveal that the nucleus of an atom is also an expression of energy, and that the ultimate bases of the manifested physical universe is nothing but motion or energy. All properties can therefore be reduced to their simplest elements such as wave, motion or li ht (Prakasha), action (Kriya), and position (Sthiti), at least for the physical universe. Dr. Taimini concludes that these three are the ideas associated with the three Gunas or Attributes. Among the planets, Sun, Jupiter, and Moon are considered Sattwic planets, representing self-formative, pure, quiescence and rhythmic motion in life's enfoldment. Mercury and Venus are Rajasic; they are involved with self-preservation, energizing action and desire. Saturn and Mars are Tamasic planets leading to a growth process, both physical and psychological, which ultimately leads to dissolution. GURU :Teacher ; he who dispels darkness and ignorance; Jupiter (q.v.). GURU-CHANDALA YOGA :A planetary combination relating Jupiter and Rahu. When these two planets are associated together in a house, it produces inauspicious results. It makes the individual depraved and inclined to indulge in socially and morally unethical activities. HADDA INDEX An index prepared on the basis of sign lord and Hadda lord of the sign. The latter is based on planetary lordship assigned to five non-luminaries on different areas of various signs. The Hadda division in different signs is given below. If the division lord and the sign lord are the same, full strength is assigned to the planet, usually measured as 15 units. In case one is a friendly planet, the strength is half, and the strength is only a quarter if one of them is inimical.

The combination is said to bestow a life of more than 82 years. HARIHARA BRAHMA YOGA :Refers to 3 sets of planetary combinations: (i) Benefics placed in the 2nd, 8th, and 12th houses from the sign in which the lord of the 2nd house is placed; (ii) Jupiter, Moon, and Mercury posited in the 4th, 9th, and 8th houses from the sign where the lord of the 7th house is situated; and (iii) the Sun, Venus and Mars in the 4th, 10th, or 11 house from the ascendant lord. These combinations make the individual truthful, effective speaker, victorious, well-versed in religious scriptures, and philanthropic. HASTHA :Hand; the 13th asterism extending from 1600 to 1730 20' of the zodiac. It consists of 5 stars and is ruled by Moon. Its presiding deity is Savitar, the Sun God. Its basic attribute is Tanias, sloth or inertia. Hastha is characterized as Vaishya, the trading community and is classified as buffalo by species, godly by temperament, human by animal type and is said to be related with the Southern direction. Its motivating impulse is Moksha, Liberation. The asterism makes the individual always engaged in activities, especially at the physical level. If the individual is still on the evolutionary side of manifestation, he works enthusiastically for the satisfaction of his own desire and fulfillment of his ambition for spiritually evolving persons, it will help him in sustaining his philanthropic activities. Hastha gives tremendous self-reliance and control over outgoing cosmic energy. It is always ready to proceed further. It contains within its radiation much generative power. HATHA YOGA :A form of yogic discipline which aims at gaining mastery over one's breath and other bodily functions by effective exercise of will-power and control over one's involuntary responses and passions. It also aims at maintaining flexibility of limbs by adopting various types of physical postures known as Asanas. These postures lead to the purification of physical and other sheaths so that the divine influx can flow easily without any impediment produced by the lower self comprising body, emotion and mind. Hatha Yoga is the opposite of Raja Yoga in the sense it establishes control over the lower self to attune it to receive the higher spiritual influx; in Raja Yoga, the development of spirituality and control of consciousness by meditation is attempted first to strengthen the transcendental forces to take sway of lower vehicles in order to spiritualize one's life. HELIACAL RISING :It relates the visibility of planets in close proximity with the Sun. A star is said to have heliacal rising when it shows itself above the horizon exactly at sunrise. Planets are invisible to the naked eye for some days at the time of their conjunction with Sun. This phenomenon of invisibility is known as combust (q.v.) or heliacal setting of the planet. The opposite phenomenon is known as heliacal rising. In this condition the planet is with the Sun but still visible. The concept is primarily related with the method of observation employed by the ancient Chaldeans who (supposedly) watched the planets every day to determine the identity of a planet which ascended over the eastern horizon immediately prior to the rising of the Sun. HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM :The system in which cosmographic coordinates are given on the assumption that the Sun is at its center. It is a realistic approach. Ever since the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) discovered that the solar system revolved round the Sun, instead of the Earth, as its center, as assumed under the geocentric system (q.v.), the astronomers began finding discrepancies with regard to certain planetary positions, especially of Mercury and Venus. For outer planets, for astrological horoscopy, there is very little difference between the two systems. In heliocentric system, the position of a star or planet is determined as if the observer is positioned at the center of the Sun, while under the geocentric system he is assumed to be observing the stellar world from the earth's center. This difference makes the moving objects appear traversing in different directions. HEMLAMBHI :The 31st year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsaras (q.v.). It is ruled by Vishnu.

He is much respected among his relatives and in the society, yet he is a miser. HIRANYAGARBHA :(Hiranya = gold; any vessel made of gold; semen virile; Garbha = womb); the inside, middle or interior of anything; the bed of a river); golden egg; the golden womb. A Vedic term used in the context of Cosmo genesis. It represents the stage when the 'one animating principle' begins to coagulate and decides the area for its manifestation. In Rig Veda, it is said to have arisen in the beginning, the one lord of all beings, who upholds heaven and earth, who gives life and breath, whose command even the gods obey, who is the God of all gods, and who is the one animating principle of their being. According to Manu, Hiranyagarbha was Brahma, the first male, formed by the indiscernible eternal First Cause in the egg resplendent as the Sun. The Puranas describe Hiranyagarbha at one stage almost synonymous with Brahma. It is stated that Brahma created the Trinity (q.v.) and then he himself emerged from Manu. It refers to Brahma's reemergence as a creative principle after the three basic attributes, the Gunas (q.v.), and the three evolutionary principles of creation, preservation, and regeneration (or dissolution) were differentiated and externalized. At this stage, Brahma took further action to concretize the manifesting principle and appeared as Hiranyagarbha, or the Golden Egg. It was further fructified by the impact of the Divine Spark or the Radiant Ray. The One Lord of the Being, the one animating principle of gods and men, arose from the Golden Womb, which is the sphere of the universe. Hiranyagarbha is surrounded by its seven zones or planes, which are the realms of form and matter. These became the seven and fourteen Lokas (q.v.) with varieties of denizens in them functioning with different Tattwas. Mahabhutas and Indriyas The Puranas describe Hiranyagarbha containing within itself Brahma as the collective symbol of the seven universal forces. Hiranyagarbha is the limit of cosmos. Blavatsky mentions Hiranyagarbha as the radiant or the golden egg or womb. Esoterically, according to her, it represents the luminous 'fire-mist' or the ethereal stuff from which the universe is made of. HORA :The rising of a radical sign; an hour; it represents a part of the zodiacal sign divided into two parts, each of which is owned by Sun or Moon. Sun's Hora is considered masculine and Moon's Hora is feminine. In even signs, the first part is ruled by Moon and the second by Sun; in odd signs, it is the other way round. HORA LAGNA :A sort of ascendant worked out by multiplying the birth time after sunrise by two and dividing the product by five, and adding the result to the sunrise on the day. HORA SHASTRA :A treatise on predictive astrology, but generally it refers to the science of astronomy and astrology both. HORARY ASTROLOGY :(horary = pertaining to time). One of the four sections of horoscopy, the other three being (i) mundane, relative to meteorology, seismology, husbandry, etc., (ii) state, or civic, concerned with the fate of nations, kings and rulers, and (iii) genethliacal astrology, predicting the future of individuals on the basis of the moment of their birth. Horary astrology resolves doubts arising in the mind of an individual, or any query with regard to any personal or other problems arising spontaneously at any moment of time. Hindu astrology refers it under Prasna Shastra, the science dealing with queries which covers a wide variety of subjects, such as the possibility of the occurrence of any event, Muhurtha (q.v.) or electional astrology; Parihara, or remedial measures, and Nimittas, or the questions relating to omens. It also tackles problems relating to longevity, death, and diseases. Horary predictions depend on planetary positions at the moment of putting the query. HORIZON, CELESTIAL :Extension of earthly horizon to space. Astronomically, horizon refers to the small circle of the celestial sphere whose plane is tangent to the earth at the position of a given observer or the plane of such a circle which is also known as the Sensible"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 212Horizon. The celestial horizon refers to the great circle of the celestial sphere whose plane passes through the center of the earth and is parallel to the sensible horizon. HOROSCOPE :Also known as Janma Kundali (sk) literally meaning birth-serpent's coil. The natal chart depicting positions of different planets at the time of nativity or any event. It represents the zodiacal sign rising at the place of birth and the location of planets in various signs. The 12 zodiacal signs are related to so many houses in the horoscope relative to different aspects of life. A detailed horoscope relates the planets, houses, and minute divisions of the signs in order to show the strength and potential of the planets. A horoscope as such is merely a kind of astronomical chart depicting planets relative to the place and time of birth; predictions based on these details depend upon application of astrological principles relevant to the specific astronomical data incorporated in the horoscope or the natal chart. HOROSCOPE OF SOLAR INGRESS :Planetary positions along with the ascendant and other horoscopes details for the moment when the Sun during its annual sojourn returns to its exact zodiacal position as at birth. This chart is used as an aid for annual forecasting. HOUSE DIVISION :The division of the ecliptic in 12 sections. It begins with ascendant as the first house. These divisions are related to different aspects of one's life. The planetary relationships with these houses indicate the possibility of a result and the time of its occurrence. There are various ways of demarcating these houses. The equal house division assumes identity of the first house with the sign rising as ascendant and each of the following signs with the successive house divisions. There are some other systems of house division in which the synchronisation of signs is not assumed with these houses. (See Bhava Kundali) The 12 house divisions generally signify the following aspects of an individual's life: 1st House: (Ascendant). General personality, face, temperament, strength, and vitality (life-force contained in the incarnating soul). 2nd House: (Dhana Bhava). Wealth and affluence, family relations, speech, right eye, neck, creative potential, and death. 3rd House: (Sahaja Bhava). Siblings, individual prowess, collateral, short journeys, chest and right ear, longevity. 4th House: (Sukhasthana). Immediate environment, home life, mother, emotion, landed property, dwelling place, personal conveyance, conditions at the fag end of life. It also refers to chest as well as peace of mind. 5th House: (Suta Bhava). Children, creativity, learning, psychological disposition, speculation, intelligence, and physically it relates to stomach and back. 6th House: (Ripu Sthana). Enemies, impediments, wounds on body, disappointments, debts, illnesses, servants, employment conditions. It also represents intestines and navel. 7th House: (Kalatra or Jaya Bhava). Marriage and legally wedded wife, business partnerships, foreign travel recognition of merit overseas, dissipation of energy, sexual relationships; it represents the loin region and the urinary tract. 8th House: (Mrityusthana). Death, generative organs, hidden aspects of an individual, occultism, legacy, unearned income, secret maneuverings, life of the spouse, place and surroundings of death. 9th House: (Dharmasthana; Bhagyasthana). Religious philosophy and one's beliefs, luck, past righteous merits natural proclivities, unmerited rewards (especially resulting from deeds of past lives), institutional religious observations (rituals), long travels, father, and thigh. 10th House: (Karmasthana). Profession, relationship with state and administration, primary activities for sustaining oneself, status in life, honor from the public, and knees."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 21311th House: (Labhasthana). Gains, income, friendship, social life and permissive sexual relationships, elder brother, and ankles. 12th House: (Vyayasthana). Expenditure, all kinds of outflows, e.g. expenditure, dissipation of energy, useless efforts, tiresome travels. It is also concerned with pleasures of bed and with the obstacles in life. It is concerned with life after death and with psychic experiences. It is related with feet. HRISHIKESH :Paramatma. The lord of various sense organs. A name of Vishnu, Krishna. The 10th month of a year (according to Indian calendar, corresponding to the month of Paushya). Pilgrimage to the foot of the Himalayas. One of the solar rays supposed to vitalize the various asterisms. ICHCHITA MRITYU YOGA :The planetary combination formed by Mars in a cardinal house and Rahu in the 7th. It leads the individual to self-destruction. ICHCHA SHAKTI :Will power; one of the not-so-well known powers in nature. It can generate certain nerve-currents necessary to vitalize some and to atrophy some other muscles. IDAJILA :Earth; speech; food; a goddess. The goddess of revelation. A Vedic goddess and the daughter of Manu (q.v.). She is referred to in two different contexts: first, she is related with Mercury (Budha), and with the origin of the lunar dynasty of kings; second, Ida and her sister Pingala are Nadis (q.v.) connected with Sushumna whose proper activation arouses the Kundalini (q.v.). In spiritual teachings, both these references interfuse to represent the basic impulse leading to human and cosmic evolution. Ida is feminine, nourishing and sustaining principle. In the Rig Veda, Ida is primarily food, refreshment, or a libation of milk, the necessary ingredient of physical well-being. It is also a personification of speech. It expresses creative potential. Ida is the instructress of Manu; she was the first to institute the rules of performing sacrifices, Yajnas. According to Sayana, Ida presides over the Earth. Shatapatha Brahmana describes Ida as arising from a sacrificial libation by Manu for begetting an offspring. When Ida arose from the sacrificial fire, Mitra-Varuna claimed her but Ida remained faithful to Manu. From them arose the race of Manus. The Puranic stories refer to several sex changes in Ida. Vaivasvata Manu wanted a son, but due to an error of the officiating priest managing the sacrifice, a daughter was born. MitraVaruna changed her into a male and Ida became Sudyumna. Under the malediction of Shiva, Sudyumna once again changed into a woman, and married Budha (Mercury). To them was born Pururava, a king of immense charm, truthfulness, devotion, and philosophical learning. Having given birth to Pururava, Ida once more, under the benediction of Vishnu, was restored to her earlier form of Sudyumna and in this form fathered three sons. Another story about Ida/Ila mentions him as the eldest son of Manu. Once Ida trespassed a grove sacred to Parvati. For this indiscretion, he was transformed into a female. Upon the supplication and prayers of friends, Shiva and Parvati conceded that Ida could be male for a month and a female the following month. Blavatsky considers the union between Swayambhuva Manu and his own daughter Vach-Shatrupa as the first 'euhemerisation' of the dual principle, of which Vaivasvata Manu and Ida are a secondary and a third form. It stands in cosmic symbolism as the root life, the seed from which spring all the solar systems, the worlds, the angels, and the gods (Cf. S.D., vol. 111, p. 156). About the changes of sex in Ida, Blavatsky maintains it to be the psychological transformation of sexes which occurred during the third root race. The changes in Ida are related with the creative role of Mercury. The union between positive and negative counterparts of the mind-principle is necessary for different kinds of creative results on different occasions. United with Ida, Mercury presents the positive, masculine, or the creative power. Yet the intelligence represented by Mercury is passive in"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 214character. This explains Mercury's androgynous nature. Ida, who functions as the concretizing counterpart of Mercury has the characteristics of both the forces, active and passive. In yogic literature, Ida and Pingala exist on both sides of the Sushumna canal in the middle of the spinal cord. They provide the channel for Kundalini (q.v.) to move from the Muladhara to Sahasrara Chakras (q.v.). The channel is normally blocked in common individuals. The trans Himalayan school of the ancient Indian Raja Yogis located Sushumna as the chief seat of these three canals in the central tube of the spinal cord, and Ida and Pingala exist on its left and right sides. Blavatsky indicates a much deeper significance of Ida when she states that Sushumna is the Brahmadanda while Ida and Pingala are simply, the sharps and flats of that Fa of human nature, the keynote and the middle key in the scale of the centenary harmony of the principles which, when struck in a proper way, awakens the sentries on either side, the spiritual Manas and the physical Kama, and subdues the lower through the higher. But she further indicates that it is the pure Akasha that passes up Sushumna whose two aspects flow in Ida and Pingala. Ida and Pingala are semi-material, positive and negative forces, the Sun and Moon. They put into action the free and spiritual current of Sushumna. They form a distinct path of their own; otherwise they would diffuse the radiance all over the body. Concentration on Ida and its sister channel Pingala leads to activation and regulation of the sacred fire. This effect can be produced by exercising will power, and not through the scientific or trained suppression of the breath. IKKBALA YOGA :A term used in annual forecasting. It is formed by all the planets placed in Panphara (q.v.) houses. It produces many desired events during the year. (See Induvara Yoga) ILA :Same as Ida (q.v.). The ruler of the celestial world; the God of gods; the God of the firmament, the atmosphere personified. Indra represents the principle of mind-power released from the limits and obscurations of the nervous consciousness. The word Indra is related with Indriyas, and refers to the organs of wisdom and action. Indra stands for intelligence, unfettered by any physical or nervous limitations. It is pure illumination. The Puranic stories make Indra son of Kashyapa and his wife Sachi, the daughter of a demon Puloman. In the Rig Veda, Indra is assigned a place in the Vedic Trinity, along with Agni (fire) and Vayu (air Indra rules over Swarga, the realm of gods, with a large number of nymphs under his command. He is described as becoming insecure of his position whenever a Rishi undertakes arduous austerities. He then sends nymphs to distract him from completing his determination. He is also famed for his adulterous behavior. Sage Gautarna cursed Indra for seducing his wife Ahalya, which resulted in the formation of a thousand marks resembling the female generating organ on his body, later on changed to eyes which gave Indra the appellation of Sahasraksha, meaning the thousand-eyed god. Arjuna, the hero of the Mahabharata, is said to be born of him. Indra is characterised as the cosmic principle of Mahat (q.v.). He represents the fifth human principle, Manas (q.v.), which is dual in character. As connected with Buddhi and as allowing itself to be dragged down by Kama, it leads to manifestations at the material or phenomenal planes. Indra presides over Jupiter, whereas Agni presides over Sun, and Varuna, the god of waters, over Moon. In the Puranas, Jupiter is often considered the preceptor of Indra., INDRACHAPA :An invisible Upagraha, satellite, of Venus. Its other names are Kodanda and Karmuka. INDRIYA :Qualities belonging to Indra (q.v.). The term in common parlance refers to the sense organs. They are classified in two categories, viz., Karmendriya and Jnanendriya. The former category consists of organs of speech, action (hands), mobility (legs), and the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 215excretory and generative organs. The latter category consists of the organs of wisdom, which comprise ears, eyes, tongue, skin, and nose that enable the individual to acquire knowledge of the external world. Jnanendriyas are connected with Panchabhutas (q.v.) and Tanmatras (q.v.). Blavatsky gives the following relationships between these three: Table: Relationship between Indriyas, Tanmatras & Bhutas Action organs Knowledge organs Tanmatras Panch bhutas(1) Organs of generation Nose Smell Earth (2) Hands Tongue Taste Water (3) Feet Eyes Sight Air (4)Organs of execration Skin Touch Fire (5) Organs of speech Ears Hearing Ether INDULAGNA :A sensitive point in a horoscope based on the ascendant and the Moon sign. Counting ninth from both of these and adding the Kalas (see below) of the lords of the sign thus arrived at, and dividing the total of these two by 12, and the remainder when added to the Moon sign gives the Indu Lagna. For this calculation, the Kalas for the planets are as follows: Sun = 30; Moon = 16; Mars = 6; Mercury = 8; Jupiter = 10; Venus = 12; and Saturn = 1. The general principle may be further modified by taking into account the odd and even signs of the ascendant and Moon. In case both these are in odd signs, the counting of the ninth sign is to be made directly, but in the case of their being even, the resultant 9th house should be counted in the reverse direction. For example, if the ascendant is Aries, which is an odd sign, the ninth from it counted directly is Sagittarius whose lord is Jupiter who enjoys 10 kalas. For Taurus as ascendant, an even sign, ninth from it counted in the reverse direction is Virgo which is owned by Mercury having 8 Kalas. Similarly, if the natal Moon is in an odd sign, the counting is done directly, and in the case of its being an even sign, the direction will be reversed. If the remainder in the final operation is odd, the final Indu-Lagna is counted directly from the Moon sign while in the case of its being even, the counting from the Moon for fixing the Indu Lagna is in the reverse direction. Indu Lagna, when occupied by a benefic without any association with a malefic planet makes the individual extremely wealthy; and if only a malefic planet occupies it, the individual may be very rich. If the malefic occupies Indu Lagna in its exaltation sign, the individual becomes extremely wealthy. INDUVARA YOGA :An inauspicious planetary combination. It is studied primarily in Tajaka astrology. The seven planets (excluding Rahu and Ketu) in a progressed horoscope based on solar ingress (q.v.) principle, situated in Apoklima (q.v.) houses produce obstacles and thereby nullify the fructification of an auspicious combination that may otherwise be present. INITIATION :Consecretion for a religious ceremony. It is a ceremony preliminary to the Yajna, sacrifice, or an important religious rite dedicating oneself to a higher cause. It is a mysterious ritual, sometimes involving the blending of the consciousness of the disciple with that of the teacher. The traditional Brahmin had three Dikshas, initiations: (i) at birth, when he received his mystery name from his family astrologer, 00 at seven years of age, when the sacred thread was given to him, and (iii) at the age of 11 or 12 years when he entered the preparatory stages of the main functions of his life. These rites are extremely personal and secret. They are consecrated under strict vows of secrecy. Relics of such mysteries are available in Egypt, Eluseum, Greece, Mexico, Scotland, India, and in the secret crypts of many less frequented areas in the wildernesses of deserts and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 216mountains. These sacred places are situated in isolated mountains, caves, forests, deserts, and lonely surroundings with direct access to nature's finer forces. The Egyptian Pyramids, the British Stonehenge, and the desolate caves of Rajgriha in India are existing monuments of once-active initiating temples. Many spiritual texts mention these sacred rites. The Viveka Cudamani mentions Manushyatwam, or the essence of being a human being; Mumukshatwam, or the urge towards Liberation; and Mahapurushashraya, or the benevolent protection of perfected beings essential for initiation in secret mysteries. Initiation is based on the assumption that the path of involution has followed a course of the entrenchment of the soul in a material sheath that needs reversal. The path of withdrawal from these material encasements requires unraveling various knots tied into the material sheath. These knots can be unraveled only after a detailed knowledge of one's own inner constitution. The Hindu spiritual teachings indicated Hridaya-Granthi and Granthi-Bheda as important for understanding one's body mechanism and to establish control over its Granthis or the knots formed during the materializing process of the soul. The process of opening out these knots hidden in the inner consciousness of the soul is known as Granthi Bheda. The initiatory rites represent the Granthi-Bheda for which the Adept Brothers (the spiritual teachers who have crossed the stages of GranthiBheda) have to take charge of the candidate. The method by which they make the candidate aware of his latent powers is unique, differing with candidate and the teacher who guides him. During the initiating rites the candidate is brought face to face with his inner nature and the finer forces of nature. The Egyptian temples, which were the centers of such rituals, are full of astronomical details; the Vedic Yajnas served the same purpose. The candidate could absorb these subtler forces to transform his nature only after making arduous preparations. These involved austerities, fasting, abstinence from impure social relationships, living in isolation, emotional purification, cultivation of virtues, mental maturity, psychic aptitude, and intuitive understanding. Atmospheric quietude and freedom from physical and emotional vibrations of the gross types are also necessary. Initiations are usually held at isolated places. They are held at a time when stellar forces are helpful for harnessing spiritual forces. Initiatory rites are of different orders at which different levels of illumination are realized. Blavatsky gives some descriptions of seven degrees of initiations as practiced in Egyptian mysteries. They reveal the immortality of spirit. She says that the candidates, after a preliminary trial, pass through twelve tortures. He is commanded to govern his passions and never lose for a moment the thought of his god. Then as a symbol of the wanderings of the unpurified soul, he has to ascend several ladders and wander in the darkness of a cave which has many doors but all of them are locked. When he succeeds in these trials, he attains the level of Pastophoris: the first degree of initiation. The second and the third degrees are called Neocoris and Melanephores. These are received after one has crossed the gates of death. Later, he is conducted to the hall of spirits. There he is taught to never desire or seek revenge, but to be always ready to help others in danger, even at the risk of one's own life; to bury every dead body; to honour one's parents; respect old age, and protect those weaker than oneself; and finally, to ever bear in mind the hour of death and that of resurrection in a new and imperishable body. Purity and chastity are highly recommended and fornication threatened with death. Then the candidate is made a Kristophores. At the fifth degree, known as Bolahala, the candidate is instructed in alchemy. At the sixth degree, the candidate is instructed in astronomy by the method of a priestly dance in the circle. After the final probation in a building set apart for this purpose, the Astronomus, as he is now called, emerges from the sacred apartment called Manneras, and receives a cross- the Tau, which at death, has to be laid upon his breast. He is now a Hierophant."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 217Blavatsky mentions that (i) every true Adept has to pass through the seven and the twelve trials of initiation, symbolised by the twelve labors of Hercules, (ii) the day of his real birth is regarded as the day he is born into the world of spirituality, his very age being counted from the hour of his birth makes him twice-born, a Dwija or an Initiate, and (iii) that the trials of all these persons are made to correspond with the esoteric significance of initiatory rites-all of which correspond to the twelve zodiacal signs. An Adept teacher once stated that the degrees of an adept-initiation mark the seven stages at which the candidate discovers the secrets of the sevenfold principles in nature and man and awakens his dormant powers. With regard to the tasks ahead of a candidate, he indicated that the whole individuality of a person is centered in the three middle or the Third, Fourth, and Fifth principles. During earthly life it is all in the Fourth, the center of energy, volition-will. The difference between personality and individuality is that the former hardly survives the latter, to run successfully its sevenfold downward and upward course to assimilate to itself the eternal life power residing but in the Seventh and then blend the three (Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh) into one-the Sixth. The Adept stated that \"those who succeed in doing so become Buddhas, Dhyan Chohans, etc. The chief object of our struggles and initiations is to achieve this union while yet on this earth. Those who will be successful have nothing to fear during the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh rounds. But this is a mystery.\" ISHTHA :The desired object. Ishtha Kala is the time of an epoch. It is measured in terms of time elapsed from the moment of sunrise to the moment of the occurrence of the event. ISHWARA :God; the Almighty God; the presiding deity of a manifested solar system. The term also refers to the 11th year of the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.) ruled by Brahma. A person born during this year becomes rich. He is able to enjoy material comforts and luxuries of life; he is a passionate partner in sexual acts, interested in cattle rearing and religious observances. ITHASALA YOGA :Also known as Muthashila Yoga. A planetary combination considered in connection with annual forecasting (cf. Jaimini Astrology). It is based on the relative motion of different planets. The order of planetary motion is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Moon takes the shortest period in perambulating round Earth while Saturn takes the longest. When two planets are related in such a way in a house that the slow moving planet is ahead of the fast moving one, Ithasala Yoga is formed. This formation is effective only when both the planets are within their Deeptamsa (q.v.), the orb. In this situation, the fast-moving planet transfers its influence to the slow-moving planet. JAGADAMBA :Mother of the world; one of the names of Shiva's consort. Among the zodiacal signs, Virgo (q.v.) generally stands for Jagadamba, especially in the sense of sacrificing oneself for the welfare of others. JAGRATA :Wakefulness. One of the four states of consciousness, the other three being Swapna (dream), Sushupti (profound sleep), and Turiya (the state in which the soul identifies itself with the Universal Spirit). JAIMINI :A celebrated sage; a disciple of Vyasa. He is said to have received Sama Veda from his master, and he gave the same to the world. He was also the proponent of Purva Mimamsa philosophy. (See Darshan) One system of astrology was also propounded by him. (See Jaimini Astrology) The name also stands for the patronymic of a certain order of Vedic seers. JAIMINI ASTROLOGY :A system of astrological prognostication associated with Sage Jaimini. But Jaimini is a patronymic referring to a special group of sages born during different periods but adhering to the same line of thinking. One, therefore, cannot be sure if the various works attributed to Jaimini were from the same Vedic source."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 218Astrological predictions under Jaimini astrology do not differ basically from others excepting with regard to certain special principles incorporated in it. Some of these special features are indicated below: Jaimini astrology lays greater emphasis on Karakattwa (q.v.) and Karakamsa than in other systems. The relative distance traversed by planets in different houses determines their Karakattwa; in Parashari astrology, each planet has its unique Karakattwa. For example, a planet which has attained the highest longitude among all the planets disregarding the sign in which they are located becomes, under Jaimini astrology, Atma Karaka while in Parashari Astrology, Sun is considered so in all horoscopes irrespective of its longitudinal progress in a sign. Similarly, the planet which has moved the shortest distance in a sign under Jaimini system becomes Karaka for wife (or husband) whereas the natural Karaka for the spouse in Parashari astrology is Venus. While it is noted that Rasis (q.v.) and houses ar e identical in jaimini astrology, the Parashari system makes a difference between the two (cf. Bhava Kundali). In Jaimini astrology, Arudha Lagna, or Lagnarudha, is more important than ascendant (q.v.). Arudha Lagna is obtained by counting as many signs from the lord of the ascendant as this lord is removed from the ascendant itself. Other kinds of ascendants also exist under this system, e.g., Bhava, Hora, Varneda, Ghatika, and Nisheka. Aspects under Jaimini system are based on the nature of the zodiacal signs concerned. (See Aspects) Under the Jaimini system, the strength of a sign is reckoned on the basis of Karakattwa, occupation or otherwise of a sign by any planet, aspects of benefices, strength of the planet ruling the sign, flanking of the signs by planets and the placement of Atma Karaki planet in cardinal, Panaphara (q.v.) and Apoklima houses. The Jaimini system emphasizes Nisheka, Adhana, or the conception time in a special way for working out the natal chart. This system also works out planetary ruler ship at a particular age (See Dasa System) on the basis of signs, the trine houses and the situation of the lords thereof. The duration of their ruler ship depends upon the distance between the sign and its lord. The sequence follows! the order of the zodiacal signs. Several special concepts are frequently used in Jaimini astrology, which are specially referred only in it. Some of the important concepts thus used are mentioned below: Argalas: A fastening latch; something intervening as an impediment; planets affecting the fructification or otherwise of another sign or planet. Planets in the 4th, 2nd, 11th, and 5th positions from an expecting planet (except Ketu) become Argalas. Lords which are in the 9th house from Ketu become Argalas for the sign which they own. When planets becoming Argalas are benefices, their results are auspicious; malefic in the position produce impediments. The Argalas produced by planets in the 4th, 2nd, 11th, and 5th positions get neutralised by the presence of planets in 10th, 12th, 3rd, and 9th respectively. Arudha Lagna: Signs obtained by counting as many signs from the lord of ascendant as this lord itself is from the ascendant. Atma Karaka: The planet having attained the highest longitudinal position after discarding its sign positions. The Karakattwas of planets attaining relative longitudinal position in the descending order refer to Atma (soul); Amatya (wealth, social status); Bhratru (brothers); Matru (mother); Putra (offspring): Gnathi (cousins); and Dara (spouse), the last having relatively the least advanced in any sign. Hora Lagna: It is obtained as follows: Divide by 2.5 the birth time in ghatis (1 ghati = 24 minutes) after sunrise, add 1 (one) to the quotient and count as many houses as this number from Sun or ascendant depending upon whether the natal ascendant is an odd or even sign. Karakamsa: Navamsa sign occupied by Atma Karaka planet. Pranapada: A sensitive point used for rectifying the birth time. It is worked out by adding twice the birth time in vighatis (1 vighati = 24 seconds) to (a) the Sun's longitude, or M to the Sun's longitude plus 2400 or (c) to the Sun's longitude plus 1200 depending on whether"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 219the Sun is in a cardinal, fixed, or common sign. Discard the multiples of 3600 to obtain the Pranapada for a natal chart.Upapada: The sign as apart from the 12th lord as the latter is from the 12th sign itself. JAMADAGNI :One of the Saptarishis (q.v.). He was a descendant of Sage Bhrigu, and was a Brahman by birth. His father was Richika, a Brahman, but his mother, Satyavati, a daughter of King Gadhi, was a Kshatriya by birth. The Vishnu Purana describes a mix-up related with the birth of Jamadagni and Vishwamitra. When Satyawati was pregnant, Richika prepared a mess, pulpy food prepared with rice and milk and imbued with sattwic radiance so that she could have a son with the qualities of a Brahman; he prepared another mess for Satyavati's mother with the magnetism of a Kshatriya, qualifying her to have a son with the character of a warrior. At the persuasion of her mother, the women changed the messes, and so Jamadagni, the son of Richika, was born a warrior-Brahman, and Vishwamitra, the son of Kshatriya Gadhi, was born a priest. Jamadagni engaged himself in intensive studies and obtained the entire knowledge of the Vedas. He married Renuka, the daughter of King Prasenajit, and had five sons, the youngest being Parasurama (q.v.). Jamadagni once found that his wife, on seeing some nymph couples sporting and dallying in the water, where she had gone to have her bath, had felt envious of them and had fallen from perfection of purity and thus shorn of her sanctity. He asked several of his sons to kill her, but none except Parasurama obeyed him. The deed assuaged Jamadagni's anger, and he granted him (Parasurama) a boon. Parasurama begged that his mother be restored to life in purity and that his brothers regain their natural conditions. All this was granted. Jamadagni had acquired Surabhi, the sacred cow, by his penance. The cow was taken from the ashram by King Kartavirya while the sage and his wife were away. On learning of this, Parasurama killed the king, but the sons of Kartavirya killed Jamadagni. His basic teaching was that one must renounce one's acquisitions though possessing the capacity to acquire them again and retain the same. JANMA, ANUJANMA AND TRIJANMA :(Anu = minute, atomic; anujanma = essence of origin; Tri = three; trijamna = thrice born). These terms are shortened expressions to describe the planets occupying the Moon sign (janma), the 5th from the Moon sign (Anujanma), and the 9th from the Moon sign (Trijanma). JATAYU :The king of birds and of the feathered tribe. The Ramayana describes him as the son of Garuda (q.v.); the Puranic stories make him a son of Aruna, the forerunner of the Sun. Jatayu helped Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, by fighting with Ravana when he was carrying away Sita, and was mortally wounded by Ravana in the fight. He died after disclosing to Rama the whereabouts of Sita and Ravana. His last rites were performed by Rama and Lakshamana. Jatayu is described as a close friend of Dasharatha, the father of Rama. It is said that Jatayu had helped Dasharatha when the latter had gone to the sky to recover Sita, when she was carried away by Sani (Saturn). The king's carriage was consumed by a glance from the eye of Sani, but Jatayu had caught hold of the failing king and saved him Esoterically, Jatayu and Garuda both are related with the cycle of Time. JAYA :The 28th in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Vishnu. Persons born during this year are victorious in wars, blessed with a wife, associated with faithful friends and successful in business enterprises. JEEVANU :Life-germ. JIVA :A term considered almost synonymous with life. Blavatsky treats it as equivalent to Monad, or Atma-Buddhi. It is the nucleus of potential vitality with intelligence in it. It is variously referred to as the life-breath, the vital breath, and the principal of life. It refers to the individual or personal soul enshrined in the human body and imparting to it life, motion, and sensation, and it is in this sense distinguished from the Supreme Soul, Paramatma."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 220The Indian religious scriptures frequently use the terms Paramatma, Atman,Jivatma and Jiva, each of which has a definite connotation. These terms assume that cosmic ideation occurs at many levels, and extending in several directions. Parmesh Shakti of the Supreme Lord, also called Avyakta (unmanifest), is the invisible core from which every aspect of manifestation is spilled out. Human individuals also owe their existence to it. The life and light of the Supreme Self in its primeval purity has been preserved during the course of evolutionary process, even in the individual self, whence it is known as Atman. The former is the flame and the latter, its scintilla. Self-awareness is an attribute of Atman, but this pristine intelligence is veiled in various material sheaths. Yet, at the highest subjective level of Atma-Buddhi-Manas, it projects itself as Jivatma, the fragmented self which maintains its identity in spite of its repeated births and deaths. In Vedic astrology, Jupiter is called Jiva and is vitally related with Pran Vayu which energizes the body and protects it from physical and other ailments. JNANA :Knowledge; sacred knowledge, especially derived from meditation. Higher truth, religion or philosophy which teaches man how to understand his own inner nature and transcend the limitations produced by matter, and reunite with the supreme spirit. Jupiter is related with the knowledge of religious philosophy and rituals. Mercury is concerned with mundane intelligence and head learning. Saturn and Ketu lead to the realization of spiritual truths and understanding of deeper cosmic laws. JUPITER :Syn: Brihaspati, Jiva, Angira (a Vedic sage), Deva Guru (preceptor of gods), Vachaspati (the lord of speech), Jijya (worthy of respect, adoration), Prashantha (serene, composed), Trideveshavandya (worthy of veneration by the three lords of gods). (For details See Brihaspati) JYESHTHA :The 18th asterism extending from 2260 40' to 2400 00' of the zodiac. It consists of three stars symbolizing an earring. It is ruled by Mercury and is presided by Indra, the king of gods in the celestial world. Its primary motivation comes from Artha, directed activity. It is classified a farmer by class, deer by species, demon by temperament, and insect by type. It is related with the Western direction. Jyeshtha prepares the individual for a new kind of divine influx. It induces psychological exploration often accompanied by material deprivation. The asterism produces arrogance in ordinary individuals, but those who are spiritually advanced, find the asterism very helpful in their inner unfolding. JYOTISH :Astronomy: the science of light and the stellar world. One of the Vedangas, the limb of the Vedas. The word Jyotish is rooted to the Supreme Light emanating from Brahma (q.v.). At the inner sacred level, it is the spiritual teaching concerning cosmic evolution, which includes the growth and unfolding of man. The Vedic seers treated astrology or Jyotish as the esoteric foundation of divine wisdom on the basis of which human beings at different levels could find light for their spiritual development. Jyotish is broadly classified into two categories, viz., G) astronomy dealing with the mathematical aspect of planetary and other movements of celestial bodies, and 60 astrology related with the prognostication of the future based on stellar conjuncture and the movement of planets. The former is divided into (a) Siddhanta (theory) which deals with the rules for determining the planetary position ever since creation, (b) Tantra, which gives these rules during the present Kali Yuga (q.v.), and (c) Karan, which provides rules for determining the current position of planets during the current period. Predictive astrology includes (i) Hora or Jataka predictions, in its application to the fate of individuals from the moment of their birth to their death based on planetary positions either at the time of conception, or nativity, (ii) Muhurtha, or electional astrology, showing the auspicious time"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 221for undertaking a new activity such as marriage, construction of houses, temples, forts, etc., or undertaking journey, schooling of children, etc., (iii) Prashna, or horary, under which answers are given to spontaneous queries at any particular moment of time, (iv) Medaniya, or national (state) astrology, under which the fate of nations, kings and rulers are prognosticated, and (v) Samhita, or the mundane astrology, which is concerned with natural calamities, e.g., earthquakes, droughts, floods, omens, etc. Certain branches of astrology also deal with physiognomy and astrological implications of vibrations of different parts of the body. Some astrologers, who have acquired esoteric knowledge of in-and out- breathing, predict future events and answer queries based on it. Medical astrology is a special branch of stellar science which is currently becoming popular: it shows the relationship between various ailments, both physical and psychological, and planetary positions. Currently three systems of Vedic astrology are in vogue. They are (a) Parashari System, (b) Jaimini System, and (c) Prashna Marg. The Parashari System is the most popular one while Jaimini System approaches the same task primarily from Karakattwa (q.v.) of different planets. The Prashna Marg lays down rules for predicting the future depending upon the planetary positions and prevalent omens at the time of the query. Some serious studies of Vedic astrology are presently concerned with discovering the relationship between yoga literature and the ancient system of astrology with a view to channeling stellar influences for human spiritual development. KACHHA :(Kachha = dry or healed sore; hem of a garment). A son of Brihaspati (Jupiter). He was instrumental in learning the secret of restoring the dead to life from Sukracharya (Venus) which the latter alone possessed. The demons did not want Kachha to succeed, so they killed him again and again, but he was always restored to life by Venus at the intercession of Devayani, his daughter who had fallen in love with Kachha. The demons killed Kachha for the third time, burnt his body, crushed his bones and mixed the ashes with their preceptor's drink, but Devayani again implored her father to bring back the young man to life. Venus agreed to do so. As there was a danger that Venus himself would die in the process if Kachha came out of him by tearing his body, he taught the secret to Kachha to help him bring Venus to life after His (Kachha's) restoration. Devayani wanted to marry Kachha, but even when he was restored to life he resisted the proposal on the plea that he loved her only as a sister. At this Devayani cursed him that the charm that he had learnt from her father would be powerless with him, and he in return condemned her to be sought by no Brahman, and to become the wife of a Kshatriya KADRU :A daughter of Daksha (q.v.), and one 6f the 13 wives of Sage Kashyapa. She was the mother of many-headed powerful serpents, chief among them being Sesha, Vasuki and such others. KAHALYOGA :(Kahal = mischievous). A planetary combination that produces contradictory results: persons born under the combination are courageous, virile, commanding a well-equipped army, and ruling over an extensive area, yet they are intellectually foolish, ignorant (dull witted), and devoid of common and garden guts. This combination is constituted in several ways: the most popular version lays down that the lords of 9th and 4th houses should be in mutual angles and the lord of the ascendant should be strong. The combination is also formed if the lord of the 4th occupies its exaltation or own sign and is expected by or is in conjunction with the 10th lord. Jatakadesh, a classical text, states it to produce learning, humility, grace and self-possession, yet the individual will be indulgent in sensual pleasures. Kahal Yoga, according to Phaladeepika, is formed by the lord of the ascendant in exaltation or in its own sign occupying a trine or a cardinal house. It makes life without any blemish: a person born under it is prosperous, respectful, benevolent, and God-fearing, happy, charitable and regal in demeanor."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 222KAIVALYA :Perfect isolation. Detachment of soul from matter and complete identification with the Supreme Spirit. Final emancipation or beatitude. It is the culmination of Yoga practice. KALA :(Pronounced as Kaala) A unit of Time. An unseen satellite of Sun. Vaiseshikas (q.v.) considered it as one of the nine dravyas (an elementary substance); in another sense it represents the Supreme Spirit as the destroyer. It is considered a personification of the destructive principle, viz., Yama, the god of death. The planet Saturn stands for it as far as our terrestrial life is concerned. As a measure of time, it has been variously computed; it is often said to be equal to one minute 48 seconds (1’ 48\"), sometimes it is said to be slightly less than it. The traditional Hindu Time Division identifies many fractions of time which are very minute while on the other extreme, its expansion goes much beyond normal human imagination. Some of these divisions are as follows: Thruti: Time taken to Pierce one petal of the tenders petal of lotus flower by the sharpest needle. It is equal to 1/4 of a kshana (moment) or 1/2 of lava, approximately 1/6 part of time taken in twinkling of eyelids. Nimiesha: Time taken in twinkling of an eyelid. Guru Akshara: Time taken in uttering a syllable. Prana: Time taken in uttering 10 Guru Akshara. Bhagan Kala: Time taken for a planet to traverse the full zodiacal circle. Savana Kala: The duration between two sunrises. Some important equivalence under different systems of measuring Time are as follows: (Some of these are not necessarily equal to one another even if they have the same name in different systems.) 100 Thruti = 1 Lava = 1 Tathapara 30 Lava = 1 Nimesha 45 Nimesha = 1 Prana = 10 Guru Akshara = 1 Asu = 10 Vipala. 6 Prana = 1 Pala = 1 Vighati or 1 Vinari 60 Anupala = 1 Vipal = 2/5 of a second 60 Vighati = 1 Nadi = 1 Pala = 1 Garidanda = 1 ghati 60 Nadi/ghati = 1 Ahoratri = 1 DayNight = 1 Nakshatra day 7 1/2 Nadi/ghati = 1 Prahara 8 Prahara = 1 Hora = 24 Hours 1 Day-Night 2 Nadi/ghati = 1 Muhurtha 30 Muhhurtha = 1 Day-Night = 1 Ahoratri 7 Ahoratri = 1 week 30 Ahoratri = 1 month 30 Nakshatra Day/Ahoratri 1 Savana Month 1 Tithi = one-fifteenth of the duration between the first day of Moon known as Pratipada to New Moon, or vice versa, i.e., from New Moon to Full Moon. 15 Tithis I night 30 Tithis 1 Lunar month 1 Lunar Month = period taken by Moon to traverse the whole of 27 asterisms 1 Solar Month = Duration in which the Sun traverses one complete zodiacal Sign 100 Thruti = 1 Lava = 1 Thatpara 60 Thatpara = 1 Para 60 Paras = 1 Villiptha 60 Vilipathas = 1 Liiptha 60 Lipthas = 1 Vighati = 1 Pala 60 Vighatis/Palas = 1 Ghati/Danda 60 Ghatis = 1Ahoratri/Day-Night"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 22360 Viapalas = 1 Pala = 24 seconds Paksha, or a lunar fort 60 Palas = 1 Ghari/Ghati = 24 seconds 60 Ghatis = 1 Ahoratri = 24 hours 2 1/2 Vii2alas = 1 second 2 1/2 Palas = 1 minute 2 1/2 Ghatis = 1 hour 11 1/4 Nimeshas = 1 second 1 Asu/Prana = 4 seconds. A Year: Four measures of a year are given depending upon the movement of the luminaries. Savana Year: 1 Savana Year = 12 Savana Months 1 Savana Month = 30 Savana Days 1 Savana Day = The period intervening between two sunrises (1 Savana year would roughly be equal to a Sidereal Year of 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9 seconds) Solar Year: 1 Solar Year or Surya Varsha is the period taken by Sun to traverse the complete zodiacal circle. It is equal to the length of the Tropical Year and is roughly equal to 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45 seconds. Lunar Year: Approximately equal to 354 days 30 Ghatis (or 12 hours). It consists of 12 Lunar months beginning with the 1st Lunar Day, i.e., Pratipada to New Moon Day, i.e., Amavashya. When Mala-Masa occurs, it becomes equal to 13 Lunar Months. Mala Masa is an additional month which is added due to special synchronisation of Solar and Lunar Years. During the Lunar Months when Sun does not crops the Sankranti, the intervening line between two zodiacal Signs, then that Lunar Month is repeated again, thus producing an additional month. During the Lunar Month when the Sun crosses two such Sankranti lines, the month is considered a negative one, known as Kshaya Masa, which is to be neglected. Such a negative month occurs approximately after 19 years, and in such a year there are two additional Lunar months (Mala Masa). Nakshatra (Lunar) Year: It is equivalent to approximately 324 days. It denotes the duration taken by Moon to traverse all the 27 asterisms twelve times. Samvatasara and Yugas are other important time-concepts in Vedic Astrology. Samvatasara is a measure of time taken by Jupiter in traversing on its average speed a zodiacal sign. In one Samvatasara, there are 361.02672 Savana days; in 12 Samvatasaras which measure Jupiter's full revolution of the zodiacal signs, there are 4332.3206 Savana days. A sequence of 5 Samvatasara, the lustrum of Jupiter, is also known as a Yuga which is different from the Yugas mentioned below. 12 of these lustrums constituted 1 Jovian Cycle of 60 years in which each lustrum and each Samvatasara is given a special name aind a special presiding deity. A Maha Yuga, i.e., a collection of yugas, viz., Kali, Treta, Dwapar and Satya Yuga, totalling 4,320,000 years is measured in terms of Jovian and Solar Years both. Yugas: 4 Yugas, viz., Kali, Dwapar, Treta and Satya, together lasts for 4,320,000 years but all these are of varying duration. Kali Yuga, the present yuga, consists of 432,000 years of which 5,099 years elapsed on April 15, 1998. Dwapar Yuga, accounted for 864,000 or 432,000 x 2 years. Treta Yuga, during which period the ideal king Rama was born, had 1,296,000 years, or 432,000 x 3 years. Satya Yuga lasted for 1,728,000 or, 432,000 x 4 years. The four yugas together comprise one Maha Yuga. 4 Yugas = 1 Maha Yuga = 4,320,000 years 71 Maha Yugas = 1 Manvantra, which is the period during which a Manu rules and guides the terretrial evolution.

The Vedic literature and the Puranic stories refer to Kala in many different contexts. The concept is used to describe many abstract teachings. The Puranas describe it in terms of Ashvatta Tree, Nagas, Garuda etc. Ashvatta Tree with its roots in heaven and branches spreading downwards refers to manifestation in Time. Vishnu reclining on the coils of Vasuki or Sesha Naga represents Time in its circular motion. Garuda as a Vahana or stead of Vishnu refers to the Great Cycle of Time. Kala which is timeless, constituting Eternity in its bosom, is even divided in several portions of 'Eternities'. Blavatsky uses the expression 'Seven Eternities' which apparently seems paradoxical. Realizing this contradiction in expression, she herself explains that the latter expression divides Duration into unconditionally eternal and universal Time (Kala) and conditioned Time (Khandakala)'. She explains that one is the abstraction or Neumann of infinite Time, the other its phenomenon appearing periodically as the effect of Mahat, the Universal Intelligence, limited by Manavantric Duration. The relationship between Sun and Saturn describes certain aspects of Vedic metaphysics related with Time. Sun produced Mann, the progenitor of human race, Yami, the river Yamuna personifying the life-giving essence (water), and Sani, the keeper of Time. Sun, the visible one, is itself considered an objective expression of the subjective Neumann. Time, in this way, expresses the objective impulse of the Primordial Cause, the Life Principle, represented by (invisible) Sun. Two important features of Kala as described in Vedic metaphysics highlight the fact that (i) Time cycle is not mere a sequence of events, and (ii) it provides noumenal as well phenomenal existence. The ancient seers connected Time with Karmic Nemesis and postulated planetary deities working out the destiny of individuals and the world so as to enable them to attain the \"ultimate infinitude\". Explaining the first, viz., the time cycle, Blavatsky states that the cycles were something more than a mere succession of events or a periodical \"space of time\" of more or less prolonged duration, for they are generally marked with recurrence of a more varied and intellectual character than are exhibited in the periodical seasons or of certain constellations. Modern wisdom is satisfied with astronomical compilations and prophesies based on unerring mathematical laws. Ancient wisdom added to the cold shell of astronomy the vivifying elements of its soul and spirit-Astrology. And, as the sidereal motions do regulate and determine other events on Earth besides potatoes and the periodical diseases of that useful vegetable, these events have to have predetermination, by simple astronomical computations. Believers in astrology will, Blavatsky added, understand our meaning, but skeptics will laugh at the belief and mock at the idea. Thus, they shut their eyes; ostrich like, to their own fate. (cf. SD., II., p. 370) Subjective and objective extensions of Time have been described in several yogic literatures as Maya, an illusion, resulting from restrictions on consciousness. It arises from avidya, spiritual ignorance. Shiva-Sakti Tattwa emphasized that the release of consciousness from the various restrictions imposed on it liberates spirit and one's time-consciousness. The yogis are beyond the trammels of time and space. They are beyond the Karmic-Nemesis. These happen due to knowledge of the natural laws, which are expressions of the Universal Time, Kala, working through conditioned Time, Khanda-Kala. Sun, Moon and the planets are never erring time-measurers."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 225Blavatsky explained the relationship between Khand-Kala, the conditioned Time, and Kala, the Universal Time, as follows: Father, which is boundless time, generates mother, which is infinite space in eternity; and mother generates father in manvantaras, which are divisions of duration, that day when that world becomes one ocean. Then the mother becomes nara [waters-the great deep] for nara [the Supreme Spirit] to rest or move upon, when, it is said, that 1, 2, 3, 4 descend and abide in the world of the unseen, while the 4, 3, 2 become the limits in the visible world to deal with the manifestation of the father [Time]. This relates, according to Blavatsky, to the Maha Yugas which in figures become 432 and with additions of nights 4,320,000. (Cf. SD, V, p. 235) When Indian Astrology postulated Kala Purusha (q.v.) as the base for astrological predictions, the concept of universal time, Kala, expressed as conditioned time, Khanda Kala, was under consideration. Vedic Astrology establishes a link between the human being and conditioned time, and thereby makes him an expression of the universal time; the man, in astrological metaphysics, is an expression of universal periodicity. KALA CHAKRA :Mala = Time) + (Chakra = Wheel) Wheel of Destiny]. An important ritual recapitulating Cosmo genesis and the role of h man individual in it. KALA CHAKRA DASA :A dasa system, or the method of working out the planetary rulership at any specific age of the individual. It is based on Moon's position at birth in the specific quarter of the asterism, rather than in the asterism as a whole. Its calculation involves many intricate details of the stellar position and the system is intended to predict certain special aspects of life such as longevity of the individual. The following is a general description of the method. The total number of asterism-quarters, viz. nakshatra padas, is (27 x 4) = 108. These are used to find out the planetary sequence which will sway over different periods of the individual's life. In order to work out the specific sequence a special process is adopted. In order to do so, at the very outset, the total number of asterisms; (27) is divided into two groups, known as Savya (15) which refers to left hand, backward or reverse, and Apsavya (12) which means not-left. These two groups are further divided in groups of 10 and 5 asterisms, and 4 and 8 asterisms. These asterism-quarters can be written down as follows wherein the numerical represent the natural order of asterisms, e.g. Ashwini = 1, Bharani = 2, Krittika = 3, and so on. Savya Group: (15) Group(a): 10 asterisms, viz. ,1,3,7,9,13,15,19,21,25,27 Group (b): 5 asterisms, viz., 2, 8, 14, 20, 26 Apsavya Group: (12) Group (c): 4 asterisms, viz., 4, 10, 16, Group (d): 8 asterisms, viz., 5, 6, 11, 12,17,18,23,24 The sequence of zodiacal ruler ship under each of these asterisms according to their different quarters are worked out as below. (Numerical in the following groups stand for the order of zodiacal signs, e.g. 1=Aries, 2=Taurus, and so on). In following the details of the calculation, it is important to be very careful about the asterism and different signs such as ( ), &, ** etc., which indicate that the sequence has taken special turn. Savya Group (a): 1st Qrs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 2nd Qrs: 10, 11, 12, ** 8, 7, 6, 0 4, 5, 3; 3rd Qrs: 2, 1, 12, 11, 10, 9, **,1, 2, 3, 4rth Qrs: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Savya Group (b): lst Qrs: ** 8, 7, 6, 4, 5, & 3, 2, 1, 12;"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 2262nd Qrs: 11, 10, 9, ** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3rd Qrs: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ** 8, 7, 6 4th Qrs: ** 4, 5, & 3, 2, 1, 12, 11, 10, 9 Apoasavya Group (c): Ist Qrs: ** 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4; 2nd Qrs: ( ) 6, 7, 8, ** 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7: 3rd Qrs: 6,5,4, 3,2, 1, ** 9, 10, 11; 4th Qrs: 12,1, 2, 3,5 & 4 6, 7,8 Apsavya Group (d): 1st Qrs: ** 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4M 2nd Qrs: 3, 2, 1, ** 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2; 3rd Qrs: 3,() 5,4, & 6,7,8, **12, 11, 10; 4th Qrs: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. From the above, it can be observed that the sequence of planetary rulership is very irregular: skips several signs, or just goes one sign in retrogression or jumps over one sign. Such irregularities are of seven types of which three are important. These are named Mandook Gathi (frog-like motion), Markata Gathi (monkey-like motion), and Simhavalokan (Lion's aspect). When the movement is abruptly reversed much ahead of its position as from Pisces to Scorpio [as in Savya Group (a) 2nd Qrs], or vice versa, it is known as Simhavalokan. It is marked **. Mandoka Gathi indicates jumping over a sign in between them, as for example from Virgo to Cancer [as in Savya Group (a) 2nd Qrs]. It is marked by ( ). When the backward motion is for only one sign, it is known as Markata Gathi as from Leo to Cancer [as in Apsavaya Group (c) 4th Qrs]. It is marked by '&'. Markata and Mandooka Gathis are often together involving irregular movements among several zodiacal signs. The planets owning the sign regulate the events during the rulership of these signs. There are only 9 signs under each group suggesting that only 9 planets form a cycle of planetary rulership under each asterism pada, but the total duration of each of these planets is different. In Savya Group (a) asterisms, the total number of years for Paramayu (full longevity) is 100 years for 1st Qrs signs, 85, years for 2nd Qr ones, 83 years for 3rd Qrs and 86 years for 4th Qr signs. In Apasauya Group asterisms, it is 86 years for 1st Qr signs, 83 years for 2nd Qr signs, 85 years for 3rd Qr signs and 100 years for 4th Qr signs. The total number of years of zodiacal rulerships for the four quarters of Savya asterisms will be found reversed from that of the Apasavya asterisms. The periods of zodiacal ruler ships which appertain to the planets owning these signs are as follows: Aries, Scorpio owned by Mars 7 yearsTaurus, Libra owned by Venus 16 years Gemini, Virgo owned by Mercury 9 yearsCancer owned by Moon 21 years Leo owned by Sun 5 yearsSagittarius, Pisces owned by Jupiter 10 years Capricorn, Aquarius owned by Saturn 4 years"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 227 The zodiacal ruler ships in different nakshatra-padas are arranged in such a way that the total ruler ship period (Paramayu) synchronized with that indicated above. The initial period of ruler ships is determined proportionately on the basis of lunar progress already made in the nakshatra-pada. The intervening sub periods (Bliuktis) are determined on the same principle as in other systems, e.g., Vinishottri (q.v.) but the cyclic order remains the same as given above for the nakshatra-padas. The lord of the first zodiac in any nakshatra-pada is known as Deha (body) and the last one as jeeva (life). Kala Chakra Dasa is primarily used for determining the timing of death, and of physical afflications and difficulties of different sorts. KALA DASA :A method of working out planetary= ruler ship (Dasa) on the basis of birth time being in morning or evening. These periods of dusks are assumed to last for 5 ghatis (q.v.) or 2 hours before and after sunrise or sunset. For computing Kala Dasa, the birth time in ghatis and palas from the beginning of sunrise or sunset is multiplied by 4 and the result is divided by 15 which gives the duration of Sun's ruler ship in years. By multiplying it by 2 one gets the duration for Moon, by 3 for Mars, by 4 for Mercury by 5 for Jupiter, by 6 for Venus, and 7 for Saturn. For example, if the birth time is 4 ghatis 15 palas (the birth time is known as Istha Ghati) after sunrise, it is considered to have taken place at 9 ghatis 15 palas [which is equal to (5 ghatis prior to sunrise which is reckoned as the duration of dusk) + (4 ghatis 15 palas which is the Ishta Ghati)]. Multiplying it by 4, one gets 37 ghatis, which divided by 15 gives 2.7/15 years. It is equal to 2 years 3 months 18 days. Multiplying it by 2, one gets 4 years 11 months 6 days. The former is the Dasa of Sun and the latter of Moon. Multiplying it by 3, one gets 7 years 4 months 24 days as the planetary ruler ship of Mars, and so on. KALAPURUSHA :Also known as Virat Purusha, the Cosmic Man or ' the Heavenly Man. One of the four Great Sayings of the Vedas is Tat Twam Asi meaning \"I am That\". This approach is based on the identity between the human individual and the Supreme Spirit. This identity provides the rationale for astrological predictions. The various planets are described as different urges of this Cosmic Man. Sun is said to be his Soul (Atma), Moon his mind (citta, consciousness), Mars his vitality or valour (Purushattwam), Mercury his speech (Vani, the medium of expressing inner experiences and understanding), Jupiter is the quintessence of wisdom (Vijnana Sukham, the happiness of understanding), Venus the impulse of his sensual attraction (Kama, passion), and Saturn his grief and agony (Dukham, the pain which arises from limitations on one's spirit). The different limbs of Kala Purusha are represented by different zodiacal signs. His head is represented by Aries, mouth by Taurus, breast and shoulder by Gemini, heart by Cancer, belly by Leo, hip by Virgo, groins by Libra, private generative organs by Scorpio, the thigh by Sagittarius, the knees by Capricorn, the calves by Aquarius, and the feet by Pisces. The 12 house-divisions (q.v.) are considered identical with the zodiacal signs in the case of Kala Purusha. The word Kala Purusha describes the cosmic creative principle operative in time. The diety represents the primeval divine impulse. The zodiacal signs are the inward impulses of this Heavenly Man. The planets represent his basic impulses of manifestation; the zodiacal signs express the various stages of externalization of the subjective essence into objective or phenomenal existence. The art of prediction in Vedic astrology consists in integrating the natal chart of the individual with the nature and basic impulses of Kala Purusha. Based on this relationship between the individual and his universal self, Blavatsky points out that every form on earth, and every speck (atom) in space strives in its efforts towards self-formation to follow the model placed for it in the Heavenly Man. (S.D. Vol. I. p. 235) KALA SARPA YOGA :(Kala = Time; Sarpa = serpent; Yoga combination). A planetary combination formed by the encirclement of all planets in a natal chart by the two nodes of Moon. It is not a combination producing penury, yet it restricts functioning of the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 228individual in many ways. It makes the individual unable to enjoy the fruits of his meritorious deeds. The joyous fruits of past karmas relating to those aspects of life which are encircled between the signs in which Rahu and Ketu are placed are greatly denied to the individual yet he is provided full opportunity to take fresh initiative in their regard. On the other hand, if the planets are situated between the sign starting with that of Ketu and ending with that of Rahu, the personal initiative of the individual relating to those houses will be greatly fettered, yet he may experience the results of these planetary positions. The overall effect of this combination depends on the basis of planetary strength, their position and special pattern of the horoscope. The combination does not necessarily debar the individual from attaining position of eminence. The Kala Sarpa Yoga expresses karmic nemesis. It is intended to arouse in the individual an awareness of his personal limitations and the omnipotence of the Supreme Spirit. The helplessness, whether arising due to the limitations of wealth, bad health, family discord, social obloquy or denial of opportunities for the growth of his personality occurs to him to remind him that they are the results of his past deeds of omissions and commissions. He has to learn to adapt himself in his present life with these conditions and orient his life accordingly. He cannot alter them and he cannot transcend them either. He has to confront them and accept their supremacy. Yet he is free to take fresh initiative in various aspects of life renouncing every self-centered approach to life. The impact of Kala Sarpa greatly minimized if three or more planets are exalted in the chart and Raja Yogas (q.v.) are also present. Even more than two lords of 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th houses are placed in cardinal or trine houses, without being in debilitation, expected by malefic or flanked by malefic, the restricting effects of the combination are greatly reduced. KALA YUKTA :The 52nd year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra, the god of destruction. Birth during this year makes the individual an agriculturist or a trader dealing with oil, oilseeds and kitchen utensils. KALANIDHI YOGA ;A planetary combination formed by Jupiter in 2nd or 5th house, Mercury and Venus expecting or combining with it. An individual born under it is honored by many heads of state. He becomes affluent, accomplished, healthy and occupies a very high position in life. KALATRA STHANAM :(Kalatra = wife; sthanain = place). The 7th house in a natal chart. It is related with wife, business partnership, married happiness, travels, etc. It represents dissipation of life-energy, and death. KALI :(Kali = black). A name of the goddess described as the fierce and bloody concert of Lord Shiva. She is associated with Agni, fire, and is said to have seven flickering tongues of flame for devouring oblations of butter. One of the flames itself is called Kali because it is said to be black in color. The Kali Yuga (see Yuga for details) personified all that is evil in the Spirit. KALPA :[Kalpa = practical, feasible, possible. Derived from Root Klrip (sk) meaning 'in order to arrange well']. A cycle of time. Astronomical, geophysical and divinisation processes of individual souls are so arranged that they by the end of each kalpa attain their full realization of Atmic Principle (qx.); those who fail to accomplish this goal are doomed to 'eternal' damnation until the next sweep of time (kalpa) includes them along with other oncoming souls for their further evolution and growth. A Kalpa represents a 'Day I of Brahma; it is equal to 4,320, million mortal years. A day of Brahma comprises 1,000 Mahayugas (q.v.) each including Satya Yuga (1,728,000 years), Treta (1,296,000 years), Dvapara (864,000 years) and Kali (432,000 years). 71 Maha Yugas (= 306,720,000 years) account for a Manvantara which is equal to an interval between the ruler ship of two Manus (q.v.), or the interval between one ininor pralaya (dissolution) and another. Between two Manus, there is an interregnum of 1,728,000 years. Between two major cycles of Kalpas, there are 14 Manus (14 x 71 x Maha Yuga) controlling and guiding"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 229evolutionary impulses for 4,294,080,000 years. Between two Manvantaras, the period of Sandhis (dissolution, pralaya, and the intervening period) consist of the duration of Satya Yuga (1,728,000 years). 15 such Sandhis intervene between two Kalpas, which account for 25,920,000 years. Together they are equal to 4,320 million years, which is equal to a Day of Brahma or a Kalpa. Each Day of Brahma is equal to his one Night. During this period there is a major period of Pralaya. A Day and a Night of Brahma together account for (2 x 4,320,000,000 years) or, 8,640 million years. 360 such days and nights equal to a year of Brahma; it contains 3,110,400 million years. Brahma has a life of 100 years, which is the duration of a Maha Kalpa. It accounts for 311,040,000 million mortal years. The concept of Kalpa refers to the evolutionary process of cycles within cycles, which are not concentric cycles but several minor cycles within major cycles of differing dimensions. Blavatsky states that theoretically the Kalpas are infinite, for they have never had a commencement or in other words, there never was a first Kalpa, nor will there ever be a last, in Eternity. (Of S.D. Vol. 11. p. 84) But practically, she further states, they are divided and sub- in space and time, each division down to the smallest having its own Dhyanis as patron or regent (Cf S.D. Vol. III, p. 180). Each Kalpa begins with a divine Avatara concretizing the earth from dissolution. The present one was brought to surface by the divine Spirit taking the form of a boar, Varaha. Each Kalpa involves activation of life-impulse several times over different globes of the solar system, and even on each globe. The task requires nurturing of several (seven) Root Races, each with seven sub-races. During a Manvantara, the task is entrusted to seven Root Manus and seven Seed Manus, the latter collecting the special souls from which to develop the subsequent Races. The names of 14 Manus in the present Kalpa are given as follows: A and 'G' represent the sequence of seven planets on which life-wave moves during each Round. 1st Round: 1st Root Manu on Planet A Svayambhuva 1st Seed Manu on Planet G Svarochi, or Svarochisha 2nd Round: 2nd Root Manu on Planet A Auttami 2nd Seed Mann on Planet G Tamasa 3rd Round: 3rd Root Manu on Planet A Raivata 3rd Seed Manu on Planet G Chakshusha 4th Round: 4th Root Manu on, Planet A Vaivasvata (The Present Progenitor) 4th Seed Manu on Planet G Savarna 5th Round: 5th Root Manu on Planet A Daksha-Savarna 5th Seed Manu on Planet G Brahma-Savarna 6th Round: 6th Root Manu on Planet A Dharma-Savarna 6th Seed Manu on Planet G Rudra-Savarna 7th Round: 7th Root Manu on Planet A Rauchya- (daiva-)Savarna 7th Seed Manu on Planet G Bhautya During each Manvantara and each Kalpa the contours of the continents and the axial alignment of Earth change.

These were subsequently regrouped in 10 landmasses distributed among the grand children. It is believed that these Dvipas refer to the landmasses at different phases of terrestrial changes. One opinion even refers them as the conditions prevalent during different Kalpas. The life of each individual during the course of his various incarnations is arranged in such a way that he finally attains the highest principle in him-viz., the Atmic Awareness. Even those who attained Nirvana have to await in dissolution until the next wave sweeps them ahead for their onward journey. KAMA :(Kama = wish, desire; love or desire for sensual enjoyment.) One of the four ends of life. It is the thirst for sensual gratification, which is considered one of the four ends of life as well as the primary motivating impluses. These four impulses are named Purushartha, the inherent qualities, self-volitation in every human individual: Artha, purpose or goal (specially material ones) of human activities; Dharma, righteousness or that which gives coherence to human existence; and Moksha or Liberation from involuntary birth and death; besides Kama. The Rig Veda described Kama as the very personification of the impulse which induces people towards creation. Kama is the seat of terrestrial and animal desires and passions. It is often identified with life itself. Prana is universal life force on earth while Kama is in humanbeings their vital principle. Kama according to Blavatsky depends on Prana without which there would be no Kama. Prana wakes up the Kamic germs of life. It makes all desires vital and living. Kama is everywhere in the body. The red cells are drops of electrical fluid, the perspiration of all the organs oozed but from every cell. They are the progeny of the Fohatic Principle. (S.D. Vol. V., p. 553) She identifies kama with general consciousness which belongs to all the objective world, even to the stones, for if stones were not living they could not decay, emit a spark, etc. Affinity between chemical elements according to her is a manifestation of this Kamic consciousness. Kama is the Cupid of Hindu pantheon. He is armed with a bow and arrows, the bowstring is made of a line of bees and arrows of flowers of five different plants. Vasant, the spring season, is his best friend. His wife is called Rati (meaning copulation). Living in the domain of Indra (q.v.), he assists gods in their fight against the demons. He has many Apsaras, the celestial nymphs, at his command who provide pleasures to gods and tempts the yogis whom Indra fears as usurpers of his throne. When Taraka, a demon emboldened by Lord Brahma's favors, conquered the gods, Kama was approached by the gods so that he could arouse passion in the mind of Shiva and induce the birth of his (Shiva's) child who could kill Taraka as under the boon. [According to Brahma's boon to Taraka only a seven-day-old child born of Shiva's virility could kill Taraka, and the latter considering it to be an impossibility had become arrogant and was destroying the gods.] At the behest of the gods, Kama accepted the biddings of Indra, aroused the creative impulse in. Shiva (Kama, passion), though in the process he (Kama) was burnt by the fire emitted from the third eye of Shiva. On the intercession of gods, considering the purpose of his exertion as noble, and to relieve the unmerited misfortune of Kama's wife Rati, Shiva forgave Kama. He was restored to life as a son of Krishna. The son born to Lord Shiva due to the effort of Kama was known as Kartikeya (q.v.) who vanquished Taraka finally and restored the kingdom of gods to them. Kartikaya is the presiding deity of Mars. The Rig Veda associated Kama with that feeling which leads and propels creation. It was the first movement that stirred the ONE, after its manifestation from the purely abstract Principle. A hymn in Atharva Veda exalts Kama into a Supreme Lord and creator and"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 231says: \"Kama was born the first: Him, neither gods nor father (Pitris) nor men have equaled.\" It identifies him with Agni (q.v.) but makes him superior to that god. The Taittiriya Brahmana makes him allegorically the son of Dharma and of Shradha. (The former means righteousness, that which sustains and the latter, respectful regard.) Elsewhere, Kama is said to be born from the heart of Brahma, and therefore is Atmabhu meaning self-existent, and Aja, the unborn (which is also a synonym of the first zodiacal sign, Aries). In Harivamsa, Kama is mentioned as the son of Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu (q.v.). Blavatsky emphasises Kama's special role in integrating the three lower principles of Sthula Sharira (physical body), Prana (the life-breath or the Vital Air), and Linga Sharira (the astral double) and cementing them with higher Principles of Atma-Buddhi, itself combining with Manas (mind) and completing the centenary principle in man. (S.D. Vol. 111, p. 183) KAMADHENU :The cow of plenty; a heavenly cow which satisfies all desires, especially of the material nature. A cow of celestial origin, under the service of ancient sages and capable of providing sustenance to innumerable ascetics who came to their hermitage for spiritual lessons and discourses. The cow is said to have been produced at the churning of the ocean. It had supernatural powers and could defend itself against the mightiest foe. Its power was evident during the relationship between Sage Vashishtha and Vishwamitra, and also during the hostility between Vashishtha and Krita-Virya. Explaining the significance of Kamadhenu, Blavatsky relates it with Vach-Viraja, the daughter of Brahma. (S.D. Vol. V., p. 165) KAMA RUPA :The vehicle of desire. It is the subjective form created through mental and physical desires and thoughts connected with material relationships by all sentient beings. Kama (q.v.) operates efficiently only in association with other Principles. In association with lower Principles acting as instinct and other inertial (tamasic) attributes, it expresses itself as physical passion and urges for sensual gratification. With Manas, intellect, it expresses itself as Kama-Manas, the psychic nature, and even inspires the individual to undertake severe austerities. Kama is also related with Capricorn, the 10th zodiacal sign viz., Makaram (q.v.). It is borne on- the standard of Kamadeva, the Indian Cupid. The relationship between Capricorn and Kamadeva is also linked with divine fire, Agni, circulating in human beings like red cells and life-breath. Kama is also related with Mara and Kumaras (q.v.). Mara is the god of darkness, illusion, death, but Mara is also the unconscious quicksilver leading to the birth of spiritual awareness. From Mara sprang the four Kumars who silently watch the spiritual and terrestrial growth of the universe. (See Kama also) KAMAL YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all planets situated in 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses which makes the individual born under it renowned, happy and accomplished in many arts. KAMBOOLYOGA :A planetary combination produced by Ithasala (q.v.) relationship between the lord of the ascendant and the lord of the 10th house, especially when one of them is associated with Moon. The Kambool Yoga is of 3 kinds, viz., Shrestha (the best), Madhyama (ordinary) and Adhama (the worst) depending upon the strength of the planets concerned. There are 16 varieties of these relationships. (See Tajaka Nilakanthi, pp. 127-148) KANDUKA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lord of 10th house placed in 9th house, the lord of 2nd in ascendant, and the 2nd and 10th houses posited by benefices. An individual born under this combination is charitable but very materialistic in his approach to life. He seeks enjoyment of all kinds of physical comforts and a luxurious life. KANYA :The 6th sign of the zodiac named Virgo. It extends from 150' to 180' of the zodiac. It is symbolized by a virgin sitting in a boat with a chaff of corn in one hand and a flaming"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 232fire in another. Mercury rules the sign and at 150 in it, it is exalted. Venus is most debilitated in this sign at 270 of it. The sign is earthy by element, vat (airy) by humor and stronger during night. Virgo or Kanya represents Shakti or Mahamaya, the goddess of great creative power. It stands for six primary forces in nature, viz., Parashakti (the supreme power generating fight and heat), Jnanshakti (the power derived from knowledge and wisdom), Ichchashakti (will-power), Kriyashakti (the power derived from thought and volition), Kundalinishakti (the Serpent Power) and Matrikashakti (the power of mantra aroused by letter, speech and music). These primary forces in their unity represented the Astral Light (q.v.), an aspect of Aditi (q.v.), the universal womb. Kanya represents the World Mother. In Vedic literature, she is known as Prithvi (the Earth), Aditi (the celestial space), and Parvati (the divine mother of all gods and men). She is a mother of all men without any intervention of a male. She is the cosmic creative generative principle. Virgo-born individuals are generally full of responsibilities, afflicted by sorrow and frustration. They are highly sensitive. Even the slightest ripple creates powerful turbulence in their psyche. Their greatest weakness is their pass ional nature. Yet they may take up yogic studies to develop their mind. Their mind principle is very active. If rightly cultivated there is no other Sign more propitious for psychic development. The Virgo ascendants have immense possibilities for their self-development but they rarely make efforts in this direction. Syn: Tanwi (a delicate and slender woman), Abala (the weaker sex), Sasthi (an epithet of Durga in the form of Katyani, one of the 16 divine mothers) and Pathona (a female deity born of lotus). KAPHA :Phlegm. One of 3 humors, the other two being Pitta (q.v.) and Vat (q.v.). KAPILA :A celebrated sage. The founder of Sankhya philosophy. He is sometimes identified with Vishnu and sometimes with Agni, fire. In Puranic stories, he is said to have destroyed a hundred thousand sons of King Sagar with merely a glance. KARAGAR YOGA :A planetary combination formed by one, two or three malefic planets unaspected by any benefic, and posited simultaneously in 2-12, 3-11, or 4-10 houses. It produces the possibility of imprisonment, or detention under duress. Similar results also occur if malefics occupy 12th and 9th houses. KARAKA :Astrological signification of different aspects of life.(See Atma Karaka) KARAKA DASA :The planetary ruler ship (cf. Dasa) beginning with the period of Atma Karaka planet. The duration of the planets depends upon their location from Ascendant, each House counting as a year. KARAKAMSA :Navamsa of the Atma Karaka planet. KARANA :Half of a tithi, the lunar day. The first half of the tithe is known as Purvardha (= the earlier half) and the latter as Uttarardha (= the latter half). Distance of 6' between Sun and Moon accounts for one Karana. One Karana is completed when the Nirayana longitude of Moon gains six degrees on that of Sun. The first Karana, the Purvardha, ends at the middle of the tithe and the latter half, Uttarardha, extends up to the end of it. Karanas are divided into Movable (Chara) and Immovable (Sthira) ones. Seven Karanas are included among the movable or the Cardinal Group known as Bava, Balara, Kaulava, Thital, Gara, Vanija, and Vist; the Immovable ones are four, viz., Shakuni, Chatuspada, Naga and Kistug1na. KARKATTA / CANCER :The 4th sign of the zodiac. It extends from 900 to 1200 of it. It is a watery sign and symbolizes a ten-footed crustacean. The sign is ruled by Moon; Jupiter is exalted here and Mars is debilitated. It is a Cardinal Sign and is classified as female by sex,"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 233watery by element, creative by nature. It resides at watery places and is powerful during the night. Cancer-born persons easily acquire money and social status. Yet there is instability in their personal life. The Sign in Ascendant raises the individual to dizzy heights and depresses him in profound depth as well. The mysterious nature of the Sign represents that level of manifestation where the divine impulse signified by Pranava (q.v.), the sacred word AUM,. is resolved into four aspects of the supreme corresponding to Brahma (q.v.), Hiranyagarbha (q.v.), Prajna (intuitive divine wisdom), and Ishwara (God). Cancer also stands for the four aspects of Parabrahma, namely, Sthula (physical), Sukshma (subtler), Bija (Causal) and Sakshi (the Silent Watcher, the witness); it also signifies the four states of consciousness, viz., Jagratha (wakeful), Sushupti (dreamful sleep), Turiya (deep or dreamless sleep), and Nirvana (deep meditation). Cancer-born persons are shy, highly sensitive, nervous, and very impressionable. Human beings born under the sign are seldom violent in temperament. They will even sacrifice their life for others or for any idealistic cause. They are very gracious. Instability is, however, an important characteristic of them. Wherever the Sign is located in a natal chart that aspect of the individual becomes instable, changeful and insecure. KARMA :(Karma = action; cause and effect; destiny). Physically, action; metaphysically the law of cause and effect, or ethical causation. 11th Nidana (the first or the primary cause) in the concatenation of cause and effect in orthodox Buddhism, yet it is the power that controls all things, the resultant of moral action, the metaphysical Samskara (the self-reproductive quality) of the moral effect of an act committed for the attainment of something which gratifies one's personal desire. Karma neither punishes nor rewards; it is simply the One Universal Law which guides unerringly, blindly, all other laws productive of certain effects along the grooves of their respective causations. Karma operates at all levels of manifestations such as physical, psychic and spiritual. It affects all forms of creation, human, animal and includes even the divine beings. Karmas are of 3 kinds, viz., Sanchita (accumulated), Prarabdha (allotted for working out at the time of each birth), and Agami or Kriyamana (to be met in future). The totality of Karma is a dynamic aggregate; it keeps on changing with every action of the individual. Karma operates on individuals as well as on groups, social organizations and even on nations. The actual operation of Karma takes into account the special circumstances of those on whom it operates, but it always aims at leading the individual to their ultimate destiny. Kamas of different kinds produce results of different intensities. For example, if one unit of physical deed produces one unit of physical effect, the same unit of emotional deed such as sympathy, compassion or resentment would produce 5 units of emotional results; the mental deeds such as appreciation, criticism and similar responses of the mind would lead to say, 25 units of effect. The impact of idealism is very intense. Even one unit of philanthropic or social action would produce 125 units of results, The results of actions are borne at the same level where they are generated. KARMASTHANA :The 10th house in a natal chart. It shows professional activities of the individual. (See House Division) KARMAYOGA :One of the four paths of uniting with the Supreme Spirit, the other three being Raja Yoga (Kingly Yoga), Jnana Yoga (the path of wisdom), and Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion). Under Karma Yoga one discharges one's responsibilities allotted to oneself dedicating the same to the Supreme and be unconcerned with their results. KARMA YONI :(Karma = action; Yoni = form of existence, species). Birth for doing action. Birth as a human being as it is only as a human individual that one is capable to generate"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 234fresh Karmas; lower animals and others act on their instincts (which arise from their pass ional and physical nature and as such are not responsible for their individual actions). Similarly, devas and other celestial beings enjoy their blissful existence due to their past actions so are not subject to the bondage of fresh karmas. It is only the human beings who have Rajasic (q.v.) attributes. These propensitivies develop the man's instrumental (Kama-Manasic) propensities giving him the freedom to react to various conditions of his life. They also compel the human being to experience the fruits of his actions, and evolve accordingly. [Also see Bhoga Yoni.] KARMIC NEMESIS :Any karmic force having been accumulated to such an extent that it could explode effectively so as to affect the psyche of the person in order to make an imprint on the corresponding Principles, the totality of the (past) karma of the specific nature brings about the necessary change. For example, a large number of small cruelties may at a time vitally damage the individual at the end of the series of small deeds but sufficient enough to explode and produce the Karmic retribution. KARTIKEYA The god of war and the regent of the planet Mars. Son of Krittikas, the 3rd asterism (q.v.). A name given to Skandha, a son of Lord Shiva without any direct intervention of any woman. He was nurtured by Six Krittikas . The Puranic stories relate his birth with the death of the invincible daitya named Taraka. Lord Brahma had blessed Taraka that none except a child of 7 days born of Shiva's virility could kill Taraka, which to the daitya appeared to be an impossibility. It made him very arrogant. He began to destroy gods. To subjugate him, the gods with the intervention of Kamadeva (q.v.) aroused passion in Shiva. His seed was cast into Agni, fire, who had gone to Shiva in the form of a dove at a time when he was enjoying the company of his consort Parvati. Agni was unable to bear the seed; it cast it into the Ganges. Kartikeya is also known as Agnibhu, meaning born of fire, and Gangaputra, the son of the Ganges. When the Krittikas went for a bath to the Ganges, the seed was transferred to them for rearing. On maturity, each of them produced a child, which were mysteriously combined into one form with 6 heads and 12 hands and eyes. Hence his name Kartikeya (born of Krittikas), Shadanana (six-headed) and Shanmukha (face to face). According to another legend, the seed of Shiva was cast by the Ganges into a thicket or reeds (Sara). Kartikeya born from the reeds was called Saravanabhava or Saranajanam (born of Sara or reeds). He is also said to have pierced the mountain Krauncha, so he got the name of Kraunchabharana. He became the commander of the gods, hence he is called Senani, meaning the Commander-in-'Chief. He vanquished and destroyed Taraka, so he is named Tarakapati, the conqueror of Taraka. He is represented as riding on a peacock, holding a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. His wife is known as Kaumari or Sena. (See Mars) KASHYAPA :A Vedic sage, and a Saptarishi (q.v.). A patronymic of a line of seers whose birth, progeny and life are mystically related with time, space and creation of all living beings. He is described as having a large part in the work of creation. Kashyapa means a tortoise. The Shatapatlia Brahmana describes that having assumed the form of a tortoise, Prajapati (q.v.) created several offspring's of his own. It is stated that all creatures are descendants of the tortoise, which represents the sage Kashyapa who was also one of Brahma's offsprings. The Atharva Veda made Kashyapa spring from time, and time was identified with Vishnu, who in his avatara (q.v.) in the form of a tortoise brought forth life on Earth."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 235The Puranic stories emphasized the creative role of Kashyapa. It described the sage as one of the seven regents of the world. He was produced from Hiranyagarbha (q.v.) from which was also born Garuda (q.v.) which represented Time-Cycle, and Brahma (q.v.) who created the universe. Kashyapa was also mentioned as grandson of Brahma, a son of sage of Marichi as well as in many other ways. He married Aditi (q.v.), Ditti (q.v.) and others, all daughters of Daksha Prajapati. From Aditi, Kashyapa begot Adityas, Indra, Vaivasvata Manu and many other shining beings; even Vishnu was born as a dwarf as a son of Aditi and Kashyapa. By his other wives, Kashyapa had numerous and very diversified offspring's such as demons, nagas, reptiles, birds and all kinds of living things. Kashyapa is also described as one of the priests of Parasurama (q.v.) and Ramachandra, one of the solar dynasty kings. Kashyapa's basic teaching is that attachment and greed lead to human degradation; the human beings must renounce all material attainments. KAVI :A poet. An epithet of Venus. KEDAR YOGA :(See Sankhya Yoga). A planetary combination formed by all planets occupying four houses in a natal chart. It makes the individual ever ready to wage a righteous war, undertake a righteous mission, follow traditional religious practices and be humble, patient, philanthropic, interested in agriculture and respected in his society. KEMA DRUMA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by Moon when it is not flanked by any planet on any of its sides. Sun is excluded from this combination. It is also required for Moon to form this combination, that no planet should be placed in a cardinal house in the horoscope. This combination which is very inauspicious is considered very significant for predictive purposes. It makes the individual devoid of any education and intelligence. He suffers from penury and meets many difficulties in life. Several other combinations are also indicated under this name, all of which suggest the same inauspicious nature of the combination. Some of these planetary relationships are given as follows: (i) Moon occupies 1st or 7th Bhava without any benefic aspect of Jupiter. (ii) Saturn and Venus in debilitation or in the sign of their inimical planets and placed together or in 7th house from each other. (iii) In the case of persons born during nighttime, a weak Moon in association with a malefic planet occupies a malefic house or a malefic navamsa (q.v.) and is expected by the lord of the 10tn house. (iv) Moon aspected by the lord of the 9th house and posited in its depression navamsa (q.v.), associated with a planet, which is already afflicted by another planet. (v) In case of birth during nighttime when waning Moon occupies its debilitation sign, the Kema Druma Yoga is formed. There are several other combinations, which nullify this inauspicious combination. Some of these are constituted in the following manner: (i) Moon or Venus occupies a cardinal house expected by Jupiter. ii) Moon is either associated with or flanked by two benefic planets and is expected by Jupiter.' iii) Moon either occupies the navamsa sign of a very friendly planet or is in its exaltation sign and expected by Jupiter (iv) Full Moon occupies ascendant with a benefic planet, and (v) Moon in the 10th house occupies its exaltation sign and is expected by Jupiter. The presence of Kema Druma Yoga in a natal chart without its cancellation, destroys even Raja yogas (q.v.) and produces much misfortune, indigence and unexpected difficulties. KENDRA :Cardinal houses viz., 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses in a natal chart. KENDRA DASA :One of the methods of determining planetary ruler ship at any period of one's life. It is worked out on the basis of relative strength of ascendant, Sun and Moon, and the sequence of planetary ruler ship takes into account the strength of planets occupying cardinal, cadent and succulent houses in relation to these three positions."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 236KETU :[Ketu = a banner used as standard; a ray of (divine) light; a meteor, or a comet]. The descending node of Moon, also known as the Dragons Tail. Ketu is represented by the point of intersection of Moons orbit with the ecliptic (q.v.). It is considered a Danava (a demon), and a son of Viprachitti and Sinhika. It is also known as Akacha (hierless), Ashlesho Bhava (cut off) and Munda (bald). Ketu is a malefic planet, which produces much worry, frustration and seclusion from social life. It often leads to perversions, yet it has the potential to arouse deep-rooted spirituality. Ketu is the counterpart of Rahu, both function together. Together they bring out the hidden potential of the individual and work out the karmic results. In this task, Rahu works from the material or the physical side of life, whereas Ketu works on the inner or spiritual plane. Ketu produces introspection, deep thinking and spiritual aspiration. It produces disillusionment with material conditions of life and their fulfillment. KILAKA :The 42nd year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra. Persons born during this year are full of artistic perception, they are coolheaded, happy, respectful to learned persons and are devoted to parents. KONA :Angle. KONATMAK AMSA :Angular distance. KOSHA :The sheath. The vehicle of consciousness; the medium through which lifeprinciples work in a human being. The various sheaths are generally named as Annamaya Kosha (physical body), Pranamaya Kosha (the sheath through which Prana or the vital air circulates), Manomaya Kosha (mental body), Vijnanamaya Kosha (the vehicle of higher knowledge), and Anandamaya Kosha (that which enables experience of Bliss). These sheaths are of different densities and they constitute different qualities of matter. KRANTI :Declination. KRANTI PRADESHA :Zodiacal belt. KRANTI VRITA :Ecliptic. KRANTI VRITA KA DHARATALA :Plane of ecliptic. KRIDHANA :The 59th year in the cycle of 60 Sanivatasara (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra. Persons born during this year suffer from anger, but they are learned in religious scriptures and traditional philosophies. They depend upon others for their livelihood. KRISHNA :(Krishna = Black). The azure-skinned, eighth child of Devaki and Vasudeva, the king of Mathura, was born towards the end of Dvapar Yuga (q.v.) He is the most celebrated avatara (q.v.) of Vishnu. He is regarded as the lord of yoga, Yogeshwar, and is considered as the most desired goal of devotees, and the best friend of children. The erotic as well as devotional literature in India revolves around his character. The most extensively studied Shrimad Bhagavad Gita was given by him, in the form of a dialogue with Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra where the facing each other in fractional war of the Mahabharata. During his childhood and later period of adult age, he killed many demons and daityas, conquered many kings and humbled the most arrogant ones but in the end was himself killed unintentionally by a hunter, who shot at him an arrow mistaking him from a distance for a deer. The name Krishna has a very ancient history. Dowson records that the name occurs in the Rig Veda but without any relation with this great deity. The earliest mention of Krishna as the son of the Devaki is found in the Chhandogya Upanishad, but there he appears as a scholar. It is said that there was a Rishi of this name who was a son of Vishwaka. There was a great asura (q.v.) so named, who with 10,000 followers committed fearful devastation, until he was defeated and skinned by Indra. In another Vedic hymn, 50,000 Krishnas are said to have been slain, and it is added in another that his pregnant wives were slain with him that he might leave no posterity. Similarity in the sound of the name, and some incidents in the life of Krishna and Jesus Christ have led some scholars to believe in the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 237identity of Krishna with Christ. Krishna represents an Indian deity around whom many folk-lures, adulatory stories and mystic allegories have been woven. The popular Krishna is described as the eighth avatara, or as the full manifestation of Vishnu himself. His life began in a mystic circumstance, and ended also in a similar manner. He was born in the Yadava race, who descended from Yadu, one of the sons of Yatati (q.v.). The Yadavas were a pastoral community and dwelt on the banks of river Yamuna (supposedly a daughter of the Sun) near Vrindavan on the western side and in Gokula on the other side. (The readers interested in mystic significance of cows and rivers may profitably see The Secret of the Veda.) Before Krishna was born, Ugrasena, the king of the Bhojas, was deposed by his son Kamsa who ruled in the city of Mathura. Ugrasena had a brother named Devaka, whose daughter Devaki was married to Vasudeva, son of Sura, also a descendant of Yadu. Kamsa was a tyrant; he was the center of kingly intrigues widely prevalent at that time. While he was escorting his cousin sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva after their marriage, he was divinely informed that the eighth child of the newly married couple would destroy Kamsa. It led the tyrant ruler to imprison the couple and mercilessly kill their newborn babies one after another till the 7th when mysteries began to manifest. Balarama (q.v.) was the 7th child of Devaki and Vasudeva, and Krishna was the 8th one. The Mahabharata and Vishnu Purana record that Vishnu plucked two of his own hair, one white and the other black. These two hair entered the wombs of Rohini (q.v.) and Devaki respectively, the white hair became Balarama and the black (krishna) hair (kesha) became Krishna or Keshava. After their birth, they were miraculously, with much supernatural assistance, shifted to Gokula, at the house of Rohini (the second wife of Vasudeva) and Yashoda, the wife of Nanda, a cowherd chief, whose wife Yashoda had been on the same night as that on which Krishna was born, delivered of a female child. This female child was handed over to Kamsa for killing; by now Kamsa knew that he had been deceived. He intensified his atrocities and made vigorous efforts to identify the newborn child destined to destroy him, so as to destroy the child in its infancy by any means. Meanwhile, Krishna as a child, grew in affection and gay abandon among the cowherd lads and damsels. His most favorites companion was Sudama, a poor God-fearing boy, and Radha, an elderly lady in passionate (platonic) love with him. During his childhood, he is said to have held the Govardhan mountain on his little finger to save the village-folk from deluge which was caused because Krishna instigated them not to pray and pay obeisance to Indra, the rain god, who wanted to wreck vengeance at this instigation. Krishna also captivated the poisonous serpent Kali-Naga residing at that time in the Yamuna river, making its water unbootable. Krishna made the serpent leave the river so that cowherd people and the cattle could freely drink its water. His most mystic act in the village is said to be the Ras-Lila, the dance festival, on which occasion he invited the maidens of the village at the river bank on a full-moon night, and all the damsels believed that Krishna was dancing with her alone. At the age of 11 years, he left Vrindavan, also known as Braj-bhumi, to go to Mathura where he encountered Kamsa, killed him, liberated his own parents (Devaki and Vasudeva) from captivity, entrusted the kingdom to Ugrasena and ended the reign of terror and disorder at Mathura. Krishna then went to Sage Sandipani at Avantpur, near present Ujjain, for learning various kingly duties, martial arts, and scriptural wisdom. On completion of his studies, he married Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati and several other eligible princesses. It is said in many stories that he had more than 16,000 wives and more than 180,000 sons. From Rukmini, Krishna had a son called Pradyumna, and a daughter named Charumati. His son by Jambavati was called Samba, and by Satyabhama he had ten sons. While Krishna was settling down as an efficient ruler, many unfriendly kings kept invading his kingdom. Jarasandha, a king of Magadha, invaded him 17 times. When Jarasandha was"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 238preparing for his 18th assault, another king named Kala Yavana also attacked him. Krishna thought it better to retreat. He along with his people moved to Dwarka, a seaside township (in modem Gujarat). Meanwhile Krishna learnt of the palace intrigues at Hastinapur, between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Kunti, the mother of the (first three) Pandavas was Krishna's aunt, his father's sister. The Kauravas, in a bid to usurp the kingdom belonging to the Pandavas made several treacherous attacks on threw Krishna came to console them on one of their miraculous escapes. Gradually the relationship between them became very close. When the fight between the brothers (Kauravas and Pandavas) became imn-dnent, Krishna became the charioteer of Arjuna, the third eldest Pandava but Krishna's army fought along with that of the Kauravas. At such a critical psychological moment, when both the armies faced each other, Krishna spoke to Arjuna, to dispel his depression at the impending destruction of the huge army with his almost all personal relations for the acquisition of some material possession. The teachings contained in the Bhagavad Gita record the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna on this occasion. In this Mahabharata war, the Pandavas won the war, yet everyone on the battlefield excepting the Pandavas met his end. After the war, Krishna returned to Dwarka. By now, his family had grown very big. He decided to see the end of it. Their unethical behaviour had already aroused the wrath of pious sages. As a result of their curses, the descendants of Krishna destroyed themselves fighting one another. In the end, Krishna advised the remaining elders to return to the Indian mainland, and himself went into meditation. A hunter seeing his tender feet from a distance felt them to be some portion of the body of a young fawn, shot his poisonous arrow, which killed Krishna. With his death ended the Dvapar Yuga and Kali Yuga (q.v.) started. KRISHNA PAKSHA :The darker fortnight of the lunar month. KRISSAMSA :A term used in calculating Dasa (q.v.) of different planets in annual horoscope. It refers to degrees of planets devoid of signs arranged in the ascending order. It implies discarding 30' for planets in Taurus, 60' for planets in Gemini and so on, from the longitudes of the planets in the chart. The longitudes of the nodes of Moon are also excluded. These magnitudes are then arranged in their ascending order which are known as Krissamsa. From these magnitudes, keeping the lowest magnitude as it is, it is further subtracted from the next higher or the following one and the same (the resultant) is put as the second magnitude, and the process is continued for every planet. These are called Pratyamsas of the planets. From the Pratyamsa of the planet having the lowest magnitude nothing is subtracted, and it remains as it is. The planetary ruler ship for different periods in the year is worked out by dividing 365.25 by the total of Pratyamsas and multiplying the resultant by the Pratyamsa of the planet concerned. The order of the Dasa will be the same as the order of the planets in Krissamsa. KRITTIKA :The 3rd asterism (foster-mother of Kartikeya) (q.v.), extends from 26' 40' to 40' 00' of the zodiac. Its first quarter lies in Aries, while the latter three-quarters fall in Taurus. The asterism is owned by Sun; its presiding deity is Agni, fire; its primary attribute is Rajas, activity. Its basic motivation comes from kama, desire. The asterism is classified as Brahman by caste and quadruped by animal type. It is related with northern direction. Krittika consists of 6 visible stars and a seventh one supposed to be an invisible one. These are the stars in the constellation of Pleiades, also called the 'seven sisters'. The influence of Krittika arouses divine qualities in men. The materiality of existence, the demonic proclivities, false humility self-centered activities, and the like do not harmonies well with this asterism. Its influence, however, is passive; it requires some positive impulse to activate its results."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 239KRODHI :(Krodhi = angry). The 38th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsaras (q.v.). It is ruled by, Vishnu. Persons born during this year are full of anger, and courage. They aspire for knowledge and medicine and relish scandal-mongering. KRURA/ASHUBHA :Cruel or malefic planet. KSHAYA :The 60th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsaras (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra. A person born during this year is very much involved in family feuds. He becomes a womanizer and drunkard with no ethics and morality. KSHEMA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lord of the ascendant and the lords of 8th, 9th and 10th houses occupying their own signs. It makes the individual support his family members and other relations. He becomes personally rich, happy and lives for long. KSHETRA :Field. The human body through which the Supreme Spirit manifests itself. KSHETRAJNA/ KSHETRAJNESHWARA :(Kshetra = the soil) + (jne = knowing) + (Ishwara = lord) = Soul Consciousness]. Knower of the self. The Spirit in man. It is a concept used in the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter XIII). Lord Krishna, in this chapter, identifies the human body as the kshetra, the field. The Lord suggests himself to be the Kshetrajna, the knower of the field. The five elements of the body, the Mahabhutas (q.v.), Ahamkara or the I-ness, Buddhi (q.v.) or the intelligence, Indriyas or the five senses and action organs, and the experience of pleasures and pains, desires, aversion, consciousness and determination (Dhriti) are all different aspects of Kshetra. All these are subject to modifications and change. Yet they are related to the Supreme Being who is eternal, changeless and unman fest. He who perceives this relationship without any movement in his awareness is the knower of the field, Kshetrajna. KSHETRA SPHUTA :Longitudinal delineation of Bhava Kundali (q.v.). KSHETRAJNESHVARA :See Kshtrajna. KSHITIJA :Horizon. KUCHASTAMBHAN :Stationariness of a planet while changing its direction either from direction to retrogression or viceversa. KUJA / MARS :The planet fourth farthest away from Sun. It has a diameter of about 6,770 kms. Its mean the distance from Sun is 227 million kms. It takes 686.9 days in revolving around Sun. It has 2 satellites. Kuja or Mars is said to be a god of war. The Puranic stories describe it as a sort of Shiva born from his sweat and nurtured by Earth. Kartikeya (q.v.) is its presiding deity. In astrology, it is said to be a malefic planet. It rules over Aries (q.v.) and Scorpio (q.v.). It is exalted in Capricorn (q.v.) and debilitated in Cancer (q.v.). Saturn, Merury and Venus are its enemies ' and Sun, Moon and Jupiter are friendly to it. It is red in color, fiery by element, bilious in humor, warrior by caste, youthful in appearance, and male by sex classification. It is specially related with the south direction. It is Tamasic (q.v.) - in basic attribute, strong at midday, fierce by temperament, quadruped by species, dynamic by nature and ever impulsive. Its favorite place of residence is the forest and it has a special affinity with Earth. Mars is powerful in the 10th house, ascendant and the 6th house. It produces Kuja dosa (q.v.) which is detrimental to married relationship. When placed in a Cardinal House, either in exaltation or its own sign, in strength, it produces Rucliaka Yoga (q.v.), which is one of the combinations of exceptionally high status in life. (See Panch Maha Purusha Yoga) Syn: Aar (spoke or radius of a wheel), Angaraka (the smouldering ember), Avaneya, Rhauma, and Bhuiniputra (all meaning the son of Earth), Krura (fierce, invincible), Lohitanga (red colored body), Kuja (part of a tree, a demon killed by Krishna), Vakra (crooked, going backward). KUJA DOSHA :Also known as Angaraka Dosha. An affliction caused by the position of Mars in a horoscope. It is formed by the position of Mars in 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th from"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 240ascendant, Moon or Venus. It adversely affects the longevity of the married partner. This malfeasance is said to be reduced and sometimes eliminated by the presence of similar affliction in the horoscope of both the partners. The malfeasance of Mars does not occur if the planet is situated in a movable sign. In actual practice, this condition does not apply in cases of Aries, Sagittarius or Pisces ascendants. The affliction is also eliminated when Jupiter or Venus is associated with Mars, or aspects it. Kuja Dosha is also said to occur if Mars is in 4th house for Scorpio or Aries ascendant, 8th for Taurus, for Sagittarius and Aquarius ascendants. Again, it occurs if Mars is in 7th and the 7th house happens to be in the sign or naves (q.v.) of Mars, or if Mars is in the ascendant while planets in the 7th are either debilitated or eclipsed by others. Kuja Dosha may not necessarily produce death of the partner; it may make the physical union between them not feasible; it may be so by one of the several causes such as death, disease and illnesses, separation which could be judicial or circumstantial. KUMARS :Mind-born sons of Brahma, who declining to create progeny by generative process remained ever 'boys and ever pure and innocent'. They are also known under patronymic Vaidhatre. Their names are variously given, and the Puranic stories mention their number as four, five, and even seven. One such list of seven names of these Kumars consists of Sanaka, Sanandan, Sanatana, Asuri, Kapila, Barhu, and Panchsika. The most popular Kumars are Sanat Kumar, Sanandana, Sanak, and Sanatana; Sana, Sanat Sujata, and Kapila are less known names. It is said that all these names are mere aliases, their real names are not revealed to the world at large. Often Skandha or Kartikeya as well as Narada are also known as Kumars. According to esoteric teachings, these Kumars represent manifestations of certain order of divine spirit at certain stage of cosmic evolution to help the Primordial Creative Spirit, Brahma. Yet they did not function in the ordinary creative processes of manifestation. Being the personification of the highest principle in manifestation, they could not be contained in any physical body. So they did not mingle with the mainstream of manifestation and concerned themselves only with the development of the inner man; from their supreme height they guide and watch the evolutionary process as the man aspires and struggles to realize one's pristine nature. Blavatsky describes them as the \"intelligent, conscious and living Principles: the primary seven lights manifested from light unman fasted-which to us is darkness. They are the seven, exoterically four, Kurnars as 'mind-born sons' of Brahma. And it is they again are the Dhyan Chohans who are the protypes in the agonic eternity of lower gods and hierarchies of divine Beings, at the lowest end of which ladder of beings are we-men\". (S,D.V. p. 78) In this context similar to the Builders or cosmic Dhyan Chohans of the Buddhistic esoteric philosophy and to the seven Angels of the Stars. They are all divine forces. They are all virgin gods who remain eternally pure and innocent and decline to procreate. In their original nature, they are not the regents of the planets but they dwell beyond the planetary region. They are not Jivanmuktas, the liberated souls, who attain their status in the evolutionary process. They have not descended to the realm of matter, as such there is no question of their ascension to the higher realms: they are Kumars, the Virgin Ascetics, who ever remain at the sublime height and radiate their impulses like the spring wind for the germination of spdritual seed within every life-form. The Kumars are mixed up astronomically, physiologically and mystically in general with a number of Puranic personages and events. Even in non-Vedic literature, references to these cosmic or divine forces are made under different names. Blavatsky mentions Michael the Archangel, Peter Sadic, Cain or Jupiter, or Jehovah in this category. (S.D. V. p. 320) Astrologically, the five Kumars are said to be closely associated with Capricorn: the pentagon representing the 10th sign, stands for the Kumars, two of whom, out of the seven, having been kept secret. Blavatsky also mentions that the Kumars are the fifth order of"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 241Brahmadevas and the fivefold Chohans having the soul of the five elements in them, water and ether predominating and therefore their symbols are both aquatic and fiery. KUMBHA/AQUARIUS :(Kumbha = an earthen pitcher). In Yoga, the practice of Kumbhaka refers to closing of nostrils and mouth so as to suspend breathing. In erotic literature, the term signifies the paramour of a harlot. It also means the frontal globe on the forehead of an elephant as well as the breast of specially a nourishing mother. These are suggestive usages of the term intended to indicate the agency through which some deeply satisfying physical or spiritual nourishment can be obtained. In astrology, Kumbha is the 11th sign extending from 3000 to 3300 of the zodiac. The sign is considered masculine, airy and fixed. It is ruled by Saturn, and no planet is either exalted or debilitated here. It is magnetically linked with Leo: the impulses received at Leo is released under Aquarius. It leads to spiritualisation and realisation of one's divinity. The sign covers Dhanistha (q.v) later part, Satbhisag and the first quarter of Purva Bliadrapada (q.v.) asterisms, owned by Mars, Rahu and Jupiter respectively. The mysterious nature of Aquarius that cannot be experienced through material prosperity is indicated by these planets. Unusual persons are born under this sign. Whether in misery, deprivation, humiliation, or in prosperity, abundance and prestigious positions, the individuals belonging to this sign are extraordinary. They do not have a happy personal life, yet they are useful to the society in many ways. Under Aquarius, the turmoil in one's life is immensely increased and the person increasingly begins to work in an ethical manner. His frustrations lead him to annihilation of his egotism. Hindu astrology describes Kumbha/Aquarius as a man holding a water-pot; he is yellow in color, fat in physical constitution, tall in stature, and normal in other respects. It is a human sign, strong during day. It resides in water, but is lazy by temperament. The sign acts primarily on the psychology of the person. KUNDALI :(Kundali = circular or spiral coil) - The horoscopes chart on which the planetary positions at the nativity or an epoch are depicted. It contains 12 divisions, each occupied by a zodiacal sign. (In higher latitudes, under some systems of casting the horoscope, more than one sign may sometimes occupy a house-division.) KUNDALI, BHAVA :The horoscopes chart depicting planetary positions in different house-divisions, which are demarcated according to unequal house-division system of casting the horoscope. KUNDALI, RASI :Planetary positions at birth put in different house-divisions according to their occupation of different signs as at the nativity. KUNDALINI SHAKTI :[(Kundala = circular earring; circular coiling of a serpent) (Shakti = power)]. The power contained in a circular coil at the base of the spinal cord. In Tantric literature, it refers to a form of feminine form of Nature-power. Kundalini Shakti stands for seven-layered power residing at the base of spine. It has its origin in the ascending force of Shiva-Shakti Tattwa, known as the Third Logos in theosophical literature. It is said to emanate from Sun but reaches the human individual through the central axis of the earth. On activation, it moves through Ida (q.v.), Pingala (q.v.) and Sushumna (q.v.) Nadis or nerves located around the spine. In its milder manifestation, it represents the nerve force; when fully activated, Kundalini quickens the activities of various force-centers, Chakras (q.v.) in a human body. Blavatsky considers it as the power of life, one of the forces of nature coming from Sun, which is different from electricity and Prana (q.v.). It generates certain light in those who sit for spiritual and clairvoyant development. Vivekananda considered it to lead to all causal knowledge, thus by developing it, in a yogic way, it could enable the yogi to possess all knowledge pertaining to life and nature."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 242The development and forced activation of Kundalini Shakti has dangerous possibilities for those who try to do so without adequate spiritual preparations and control over one's lower nature. It is the force that moves in a serpentine curved path. It is the universal life-principle, which manifests everywhere in nature. The mastery over Kundalini is to be accomplished at every birth. Age does not affect the development of the Chakras (q.v.). Yet health is a necessity for it because only a strong body can endure the strain of its activation. The yogic literature describes moral purity, sexual abstinence and emotional stability as essential qualifications before any practice towards its activation is recommended to be practiced. KURMA YOGA :A planetary combination produced by benefices in 5th, 6th, and 7th houses either in exaltation, own signs, or those of friendly planets, or in the navamsa (q.v.) of friendly planets. Alternatively, it is formed if the benefices are in ascendant, 3rd, and 11th houses occupying exaltation, own signs, or their Mool Trikona (q.v.) positions. Persons born under this yoga become leaders, very renowned, charitable, helpful, and they lead a very happy life. KUSUMA YOGA :The planetary combination formed by Saturn occupying the 10th house, Venus placed in a cardinal house with fixed signs and a weak Moon in a trine house. Alternatively, Jupiter should be in ascendant, Moon in the 7th and Sun occupying 8th position from Moon (that is, in the 2nd house in this situation). Persons born with this combination belong to an aristocratic family, they attain high status in the society, and possess charitable disposition and enjoy unblemished glory. KUTA :Points of agreement in matching horoscopes for marriage. Kutas indicate planetary compatibility between the partners, which measures their capacity to bear the strain of their marital responsibility and relationships. About 25 Kutas have been identified of which some important ones are Rasi, Rasyadhipa, Vasyam, Mahendra, Gana, Yoni, Dina, Stridirgha, Rajju and Vedha. Some details of these are given below: Rasi Kuta: A male born in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th asterisms counted from Moon-sign of the female partner is inauspicious; those who are born in 11th, 8th (under certain special conditions), 9th, 10th, 1lth, and 12th are acceptable. The auspicious effects of Rasi Kuta are destroyed by the two Moon-signs owned by the same planet or by friendly planets. Rasyadhipa Kuta also known as Graha Maitri, signifies friendliness among the concerned planets. The nature of the rulers of the Moonsigns ip the two horoscopes indicates the possibility of psychological compatibility of the partners. Vasyam: Every zodiacal sign is assigned some Vasya signs. If the male is born in a sign which is the Vasya sign to that of the male, their marriage is recommended. Vasyain indicates the magnetic attraction between the partners. Mahendra Kuta: According to this Kuta, if the asterism of Moon in a male chart is 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd, or 25th from the same in a female chart, it portends happiness and longevity of the partner. Gana Kuta reveals the temperamental affinity between the partners. In order to find it out asterisms are divided into devas (gods), asuras (demons), and manusyas (human beings). The asterisms in which Moon in the charts of the partners are situated determine the Gana Kutas. Yoni Kuta: Any alliance between two partners should be such that the asterisms of Moon classified as male and female are harmoniously blended. It is important specially to find out whether normal, homosexual or lesbian attraction between the partners would exist. Dina Kuta: It takes into account the various quarters of the asterisms of Moon between the partners, especially to determine the endurance of the relationship. Certain quarters of various asterisms are considered not well adjusted between themselves. These should be avoided."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 243Stri Dirgham: It emphasises that the asterisms of Moon in both the charts should be beyond certain specified distance. Rajju: The word means a rope or a cord. It determines the strength and duration of the married life. It is based on the consideration that Moon-asterism of the partners should not as a general rule belong to the same kind of RaJu (all asterisms have been classified in five kinds of Rajjus). Vedha denotes opposition, antagonism and distress. Certain asterisms are discordant among themselves. They require to be avoided in matching the horoscopes. On the basis of Kuta considerations, certain values are assigned to different horoscopes. The number of harmonious points indicates the degree of compatibility between the partners. KUTA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all planets consecutively placed from 4th to 10th houses. It makes the individual dwell in forests or mountainous regions are very cruel in temperament. KUTILAA :Also known as Vikalaa and Vakragaa, it refers to planetary motions in its indeterminate zones of retrogression. Vakragaa and Kutilaa both refer to the position of retrogression, yet they differ slightly in their connotation. Immediately on acquiring stationary position (sthambhan) after its direct motion, the planet retrogrades with increasing speed. Kutilaa refers to stagnation of such a planet at this position. In the same way, prior to its regaining its direct motion, the speed of retrogression slows down prior to its sthambitan. Retrogression prior to this position of stationeries is known as Vakragaq LAGNA :Ascendant, or the first house in a horoscope. It portends psychological features, early childhood, and totality of life in essence. It represents the physical body; head, including brain; general appearance; and general attractiveness. The person's nature, his capacity to enjoy the pleasures of life, his struggles, pleasures and pain to be experienced in life are indicated by it. The ascendant lord represents the guardian angel of the individual; it protects him and provides the motivation for his actions. Sun, Mars, and Jupiter are auspicious when in ascendant. The ascendant lord in cardinal houses or in a trine house bestows physical comfort; when in Trik, i.e., in 6th, 8th or 12th house, it leads to difficulties. LAGNA, HORA :It specifies the zone of sensitivity to the impact of different planets. Jaimini Astrology makes use of it for determining one's life-span. There is no universally accepted method for working out Hora lagna. According to Parashara, it is obtained by multiplying the birth ghatis (q.v.) by 2, dividing the product by 5, and adding the quotient to the birth ghatis. Jaimini Astrology lays down several methods for calculating it, but all of them produce different results. One such method is being given below: Ahapranianam, i.e., duration of the day, or Ratripramanam, duration of the night, in ghatis, is first noted. If the birth is in daytime, the duration of the day is divided by 12, and the birth ghatikas from sunrise are divided by the quotient thus obtained. The quotient plus one counted from ascendant in the forward direction for odd sign ascendant, and in reverse direction for even sign ascendants gives the sign of the Hora lagna. The remainder, converted into degrees, indicates its longitude. The same procedure is adopted for nighttime births, but in this case the duration of night is taken into account and the birth ahatikas used in the method are counted from sunset rather than from sunrise. LAKSHMI YOGA :A planetary combination formed by a strong lord of the ascendant, the lord of the 9th in its own, exaltation or its Moola-Trikona (trine) sign occupying a cardinal house. Persons born under it are graceful, religious, wealthy, accomplished, famous, and enjoy high status in the society. Their offspring's are very bright. LAYA :Deluge. The dissolution when the manifest universe is assimilated in the Original Cause."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 244In Yoga, it refers to that meditation practice in which the consciousness of a yogi merges with the consciousness of his deity. In occultism, it stands for that state in which the substance (the seeker) becomes homogeneous with the object (the sought); at that level the seeker, or the substance, cannot be distinguished from the object because of the complete annihilation of his ahamkara, egotism, and cannot act differently from his deity. LEO/SIMHA :The 5th sign of the zodiac extending from 1200 to 1500. Sun rules this sign, and traverses the sign roughly between mid-August and mid September annually. It is fiery in element, male by sex, fierce by temperament, bilious by body humor and is related with the eastern direction. Leo represents the creative urge of the cosmic man. It provides a tremendous aspiration to grow and multiply, spread and develop. On the physical plane, those who are born with Leo as ascendant have great virility. But such individuals suffer from marital discord. They are difficult persons to live with; and their relationships spring from their self-centered nucleus. Sun and Mars vibrate favorably with Leo. The same is not true for Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn. If Mercury is well supported, it produces creative thinking, sharp intellect, money, and high social status as a result of literary efforts. Individuals with Leo as ascendant are brilliant, yet are dissatisfied with themselves. LILA :The sport of gods, particularly that of Shiva in his creative and destructive dance. Under Ida, the actor is not identified with his action. LINGAM :The phallus as a symbol of divine generative power; the abstract symbol of creation. The symbol by which Shiva is universally worshipped. The lingam is, sometimes, represented merely by a plain column of stone, or a cone of plastic clay, suggesting no offensive ideas. In India, there are 12 great lingams in different parts of the country. The famed one is a natural formation of ice, and is situated in Amamath. LINGA SHARIRA :The matrix of the physical body; it is the vital and prototypal body. Sometimes it is called the Etheric Double and on other occasions, the Astral Body. In Vedic literature, it is commonly described as the reflection of the man of flesh through which vital air, Prana circulates and activates the man. It is said to be born before the formation of the nucleus physical body, and it dies or fades out with the disappearance of the last atom of the physical body. LOGOS :The word in the context of cosmic manifestation, or the second person of the Hindu Trinity. The rational principle that governs and develops the universe. It is said to be that divine word or the reason incarnate in Jesus Christ. Blavatsky considers it as the manifested deity with every nation and people; the outward expression, or the effect of the cause which is ever concealed. Taimini compared Logos with the diffused light of Sun shining over a landscape, which while remaining invisible brings out from the objects present in ii all kinds of colors and forms according to their names. Similarly the consciousness and life of the Logos pervading the solar system, though remaining invisible, brings out from all the objects, animate and inanimate, an infinite variety of expressions, which are the characteristic of the manifested universe. (cf. Man, God and the Universe, p. 286) LOKA A world; a division of the universe; a realm of existence. In general the three lokas (tri-lokas) are heaven, earth, and hell. Another classification enumerates seven lokas, exclusive of the infernal regions, also seven in number which are classed under Patala Lokas, or the infernal/nether regions. The upper worlds are (i) Bhur Loka (Earth), (2) Bhuvar Loka (Antariksha, the space between Earth and Sun), (3) Swarga Loka (the heaven world ruled by Indra; the space between Sun and the Pole Star), (4) Mahar Loka (the world of the Adepts who are coexistent with Brahma), (5) Jnana Loka (the world of celestial beings such as mind-born sons of Brahma), (6) Tapas Loka (the world of immortal ascetics, the Vairagis), and (7) Satya Loka (the world of Brahma, the Supreme Deity). The first three"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 245lokas are known as Kritaka Lokas and the three above Mahar Loka are Akrita Loka. The former gets dissolved after every kalpa (q.v.), the latter at the end of Brahma's life (i.e., one hundred of his years). The fourth, or the Mahar Loka, is equally permanent, but is uninhabitable at the time being due to the beat as Kritaka Loka is burning. The Sankhya and the Vedantic Schools of philosophy recognised 8 lokas, viz., (i) Brahma Loka (the world of superior deities), (ii) Pitri Loka (the world of Pitris, Rishis and Prajapatis), (iii) Soma Loka (the realm of Moon and the planets), (iv) Indra Loka (the abode of inferior deities), (v) Gandharva Loka (where the heavenly spirits dwell), (vi) Rakshasa Loka (the realm of the demons), (vii) Pishacha Loka (the abode of evil spirits), and (viii) Yaksha Loka (the world of Yakshas) (q.v.). Patala Lokas are the infernal regions, inhabited by Nagas, Daityas, Danavas, etc. They have been classified differently in different scriptures. According to Padma Purana, these infernal lokas are (i)Patala (where dwell the Nagas under the rulership of Vasuki; where dwell the animal body of men and their material propensities), (ii) Mahatala (the abode of men's astral body; here reside the great serpents), (iii) Rasatala (the plane of passionate and lustful beings; where Daityas and Danavas dwell), (iv) Talatala (the clinging of lower Manas to the sentient and objective life; the realm of Maya), (v) Sutala (identification of man with his animal nature; the realm ruled by Bali), (vi) Vitala (the realm where animal nature in man is delinked from his higher nature; the realm ruled by a form of Shiva), and (vii) Atala (the realm of perpetual state of torture). The first four of these have forms, known as Rupa Lokas, are under the rule of Mahamaya; and the last three are formless, i.e., Arupa Lokas. The Shiva Purana enumerates 8 infernal realms, viz., Patala, Tala, Atala, Vitala, Taala, Vidhi Patala, Sarkara-Bhumi and Vijaya. It is said that Narada (q.v.) visited these lokas and found them resplendent with their own lustre; they did not need Sun's rays. These lokas were more delightful than Indra's heaven and have every kind of luxury and sensual gratification. LOKAPALS Guardians of the world. They preside over the 8 points of the compass. They are Indra (East), Agni, or Fire (South-East), Yama (South), Surya, or Sun (South-West), Varuna (West), Vayu, or Air (North-West), Kubera (North), Soma, or Moon (North-East). Nritti is sometimes substituted for Sun, and Prithvi (or Shiva, especially in his form Ishana) for Soma, or Moon. Each of these guardians has an elephant, which defends and protect the various quarters. These 8 elephants are themselves, often, called as Lokapals. These elephants have been given different names: (1) Indra's elephant is Airavat; (2) Agni's elephant is Pundarika, and its female is Kapila; (3) Yama has Vamana as his elephant, and its female is Pungala; (4) Sun's elephant is Kumuda, and its female is Anupama; (5) Var-una has Anj.Ana, whose female is Anjanavati; (6) Vayu has Pushpadanta, whose female is Subhadanti; (7) Kubera's elephant is Sarvabhauma, and (8) Soma's elephant is Supratika-Tamrakarni. LUMB :Perpendicular. LUNAR ASTERISM :Asterisms, Nakshatra . LUNAR PITRIS :The celestial beings who acquired and developed their mind on Moon chain of manifestation, and now assist the evolution on Earth in building different forms of life on it. LUNATION :The period taken by Moon to arrive at the same point after completing one revolution. For example, if Moon was at birth at 8* 12' of Aries, a lunation would be accomplished when Moon arrives at this longitude again. It is called Periodical Lunation, and is usually performed in 27 days, 7 hours and 41 minutes. A Synod cal Lunation covers the duration from the time Moon quits Sun until it again overtakes it, which occurs in a out 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes. This is also called Embolismic Lunation. When Moon"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 246forms a conjunction, square, or opposition relationship with Sun, such relationships with Sun are also known as Qualified Lunation. MADAN YOGA :A planetary combination constituted by the lord of the 10th house posited in ascendant along with Venus and the lord of 11th house occupying the 11th house itself. The combination makes the individual born under it very attractive and highly placed in political circles. He begins prospering at an early age of twenty years. MADHYANA REKHA :Meridian. MAGHA/MAKHA :The 10th asterism. Also known as Makha . MAHABHARATA :The great war of the Bharatas. The great epic poem, probably the longest in the world, containing more than 2,20,000 lines. It describes the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas who were the descendants, through Bharata from Puru, of the great ancestor of one of the lunar races. In this war, Krishna agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna, the most resplendent among the Pandavas, while Krishna's army sided with the Kauravas. When Arjuna was reluctant to fight for the kingdom, to which he had a legitimate right, and to kill his cousins and relatives, Krishna advised him and this advice became the Bhagavad Gita. The epic contains 18 chapters, and the war also lasted 18 days. Krishna Dwayapayana, better known as Vedavyasa, is not only the author of the epic, but also the source from whom the chief actors of the drama have sprung: Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur were all the off springs of his seed. The epic contains much wisdom and information. The Mahabharata, considering its importance in Indian philosophy and thought, is reckoned as the 5th Veda. MAHA BHUTAS :The 5 primary elements, viz., Earth (Prithvi), Water (Apas), Fire (Agni), Air Wayu), and Sky Washa). MAHA DASA :The main period of planetary ruler ship. (See Dasa System) MAHAMAYA :The great illusion, deception. Illusion personified as a female form of celestial origin, created for the purpose of beguiling individuals. Under its spell, even intellectuals and spiritual persons are deluded. Even Narada, the mind-born son 6f Brahma and a great ascetic, could not escape its ensnarement. Mahamaya is also known as Mahadevi, the female creative power of the Supreme Lord and represents the dawn of the supreme inner wisdom. Mahamaya and Mahadevi are known as the two sides of the same reality. Mahamaya is also known as Durga (the inaccessible), the wife of Lord Shiva. MAHA PATAKA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by Moon associated with Rahu, and aspected by Jupiter conjunct with a malefic. It leads the individual, even if highly intellectual and well placed in society, to indulge in mean behavior and acts. MAHA PRALAYA :A total dissolution of the universe when the 7 Lokas (q.v.) and their inhabitants, including Brahma, are annihilated. MAHAPURUSHA YOGAS :Planetary combinations which indicate maturity of the soul. These are formed if any of the five luminaries, namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Venus, possessed of strength occupies its own, exaltation, or friendly sign identical with cardinal houses. These planets produce five kinds of illustrous personages, and the combinations are known as Sasa, Ruchaka, Bhadra, Hamsa, and Malavya yogas formed by Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively. These combinations induce the individual to liberate himself from involuntary actions and to direct one's conscious efforts towards certain specific goals in his life. [For details, see each of these yogas separately.] MAHAT :Great; the great ones. Universal intelligence and consciousness. It is the first product of primeval root matter, Mula Prakriti, also known as Pradhana in Sankhya philosophy. It is the producer of the thinking principle, and -of egotism, Ahamkara. In Sankhya philosophy, it is intellect as distinguished from mind, the second of the 25 elements or Tattwas. Mahat or Maha-Buddhi, according to the Vaishnavas, is the cause of all things. The Secret Doctrine considers it as the universal soul. It is the cosmic noumenon of matter,"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 247the basis for intelligent operations in and of nature. (SD, 1. p. 82) Blavatsky states that Chit (q.v.) or consciousness is synonymous of Mahat for the yogis, but in esoteric philosophy, it is the root of Chit and Chit is a quality of Manas in conjunction with Buddhi (q.v.). It is a quality that attracts to itself spiritual affinity when it develops sufficiently in man. MAHESH :Lord Shiva. MAKARA :The 10th sign of the zodiac. It is also known as Capricorn. It is ruled by Saturn; Mars is exalted in it; and Jupiter is debilitated. Karnadeva (q.v.), the god of human desires and passion, has the insignia of Makara on his standard. Its numerical value is 5, and is related with the faces of the universe, said to be bound by a pentagon. The sign represents the spirit of eternal life and the spirit of life and love terrestrial in a human being at one and the same time. Makara is a deeply mystic sign. There is a mystic connection between it, represented by a goat, a half-fish and a half-human figure and Kumaras (q.v.). It is symbolized by a crocodile, which refers to the central seat of Dakshinamurti, whose mystic dwelling is around the Tropic of Capricorn. The sign is described as gentle and mild, Tamasic by temperament, earthy by element, and related with the southern direction. It is powerful during night. It is fond of forests and wilderness, and greatly swells under water. By itself Makara is ineffective in producing results; it produces powerful results under the influence of a planet by association, aspect or relationship in planetary combinations. The sign is classified as even, signifying its materialistic nature. Persons born under this sign invariably suffer from mental conflict. The sign produces turmoil, disharmony, and inner emptiness. Only under strong spiritualizing influence of Sun, Mars, and the nodes can one expect latent spirituality of the person to externalize. T. Subba Rao, a great occultist of the 19th century, states that the word Makara, commonly translated as crocodile, refers to simultaneous representation of both microcosm and macrocosm as external objects of perception. The numerical value of the word Makara represented the five limbs of man. It refers to man's inner and outer qualities, the man with his five organs of action and five organs of knowledge. The sign includes within its influence the entire manifestation. [See, T. Subba Rao, Collection of Esoteric Writings, TPH, pp. 10-12; H.P. Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine, vol. IV, pp. 147-48] MAKAR SANKRANTI :Ingress of Sun in Capricorn. Sun on this day moves into the northern hemisphere. Bhishma, the grand sire of the Mahabharata, awaited for this moment to give up his life. Mythologically, the inauspicious nature of this phenomenon is represented by Sankranti Pitnislia, who is said to possess three heads, two faces, five mouths, three eyes, four large ears, bloody and red colored teeth, long nose, eight limbs, two legs, black complexion, ugly appearance, and half-man and half-lion in composition. These physical characteristics vary each year depending upon astrological factors. Sankranti Purusha gets a new name every year such as Rakshas, Mandakini, Manda, Dhwanaksha, etc. These names suggest the special results expected during the year. MAKHA/MAGHA :The 10th asterism extending from 1200 00' to 1330 20' of the zodiac. The constellation consists of 5 stars and is symbolized by a house as well as a palanquin. It is ruled by Ketu, and its presiding deities are the Pitris, the great ancestors of humanity. Its primary motivation comes from Artha (q.v.) suggesting 'seeking of specific goals'. Its basic attribute is Tamas. It is classified a worker by vocational class, rat by species, demon by temperament, and forest dweller by animal type. It is related with the western direction.Under Makha, the soul is pushed out into the world with much energy and courage. Under its favorable influences, it is capable of bestowing much affluence, physical comforts, sexual pleasures and other luxuries of life. It makes the individual an idealist amidst material abundance, if the planetary configuration is supportive for it-"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 248MALAYOGA :A planetary combination formed by the lords of the 2nd, 7th, 9th and 11th houses posited in their respective signs. It bestows high administrative status on the individual and makes him a minister, a royal treasurer, or a leader of the people. His fortune brightens after the age of 33 years. MALAVYA YOGA: One of the 5 planetary combinations for human greatness, viz., Panch Maha Purusha Yoga, formed by Venus in exaltation or occupation of its own sign and situated in a cardinal house. It makes the person the head of a cultural organization, gives him a life-span of 70 years. The individual dies at a sacred place, practicing yoga and penance. The individual with Malavya Yoga possesses a graceful appearance with the luster of Moon; he has a narrow waist, attractive lips, long hands, deep voice, and well-formed teeth. He rules over the western part of the country and lives happily up to a ripe old age. MALEFICS :Inauspicious planets, especially Saturn, Mars, nodes of Moon, and Moon itself when it is weak. MALIKA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all the 7 planets, excluding Rahu and Ketu, placed one in each house, beginning with any house consecutively in the natal chart. There should be only one planet in each house, and no sign in the chain should be vacant. It is one of the exceptionally auspicious combinations depending upon the house from where the series starts, the auspicious nature of the result is predicted. MANAS :Mind; intelligence; the thinking principle with matured synthetic sense. When unqualified, it refers to the higher self, or the spiritual soul, otherwise it represents Kama-Manas, the instrumental principle in man. Manas is mind or the internal organ of perception and cognition. It is the instrument by which objects of sense perception carry experiences to the soul and based on one's own spiritual development enable it to see the world from a real standpoint. In Nyaya Philosophy, Manas is regarded as a Dravya, substance, and is distinct from Atmati, the soul. It is an important base of the higher triad consisting of Atma-Buddhi-Manas; it forms a bridge between the subjective and the objective parts of a human personality. The feeling of self-consciousness arises from it. MANAS PUTRA :The mind-born sons of Brahma, e.g., Kumars , Narada , Marichi , and others. MANDALA :Circle; globe; wheel. A mystical wheel or diagram in which various symbolic patterns are drawn, representing different divine powers (deities) and their ways of manifestation at different levels. The drawings form a part of the rituals intended for invoking gods. It is a part of an elaborate ritual among the Tibetan Lamas. The 10 divisions of the Vedas as well as the whole of the zodiacal circle are also known as Mandalas. MANDI :An Upagraha (a satellite), attached to Sat-urn; is also known as the son of Saturn. It is an invisible, rather a hypothetical point. Its position is mathematically ascertained for predictive purposes. When the length of day and night is 30 ghatikas (60 ghatikas make 24 hours) each, the position of Mandi on weekdays, counting from Sunday onwards, is at the end of ghatikas 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 6, and 2 during daytime, and during night time, at the end of 10, 6, 2, 26, 22, 18, and 14 ghatikas respectively. The following formula helps in working out the position of Mandi. D or N (as the case may be) X I / 30 = M 30 where M is birth ghati after sunrise or sunset, D is duration of day expressed in ghatis, N is duration of night in ghatis, I is the Index from the following table: Table: Table of Mandi Indices"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 249Week day Day Night Sunday 26 10 Monday 22 6 Tuesday 18 2 Wednesday 14 26 Thursday 10 22 Friday 6 18 Saturday 2 14 Taking M in ghatis and vighatis (q.v.) we have to find out the ascendant and navamsa for the time indicated by M. The Rasi and Navamsa revealed will be the Rasi and Navamsa occupied by Mandi for a particular nativity. Indian ephemeris (Panchanga) give ahas (daytime) for the day as well as night. If it is not available there, the time of rising and setting of Sun can be ascertained from other sources. Mandi is very important in judging the correctness of an ascendant, which should conform to any of the following positions, specially if Moon is not strong in the natal chart: 1. Ascendant will be trine to the lord of the house occupied by Mandi. 2. Ascendant will be trine to the lord of the house occupied by the same -in Navamsa. 3. Ascendant will be trine to the Navamsa house of the Mandi itself. Mandi is a dreaded malefic, but it gives good results in the 6th and 11th houses. Its association with a planet makes the planet inauspicious. If the lord of the house occupied by Mandi is in a cardinal or a trine house with reference to ascendant, it bestows plenty of riches and fame on the individual. MANDUKA GATI :Frog-leap. A term used in working out Kala Chakra Dasa MANGAUMARS :See Kuja. MANOMAYA KOSHA :The sheath of mental activities which receives all sense impressions and forms its own ideas, thus giving rise to the idea of 'I' and 'Mine', thereby creating illusion, avidya. The organs connected with sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, together with mind constitute the mental sheath. It enables the individual to identify various objects and perceptions and distinguish one from another. It permeates the Pranamaya Kosha, the sheath through which vital air, or Prana, circulates throughout the body. The various desires are activated by active participation of the mental sheath and the energy circulating through it. MANTRA :Primarily that portion of the Vedas which contains hymns, as distinct from Brahmanas. The mantras, or the instruments of conveying thoughts, consists of prayers and praise embodied in metrical hymns. Popularly, mantras now refer to a particular combination of sounds, or words, whose recitation is expected to bring about certain specified results. Japa, which is meditative, or repeated, utterance, whether articulate or mental, is an important complement of mantra-siddhi, realisation through mantras. Those mantras which consist of merely one letter are known as Pinda, of two letters kartari, of three to nine letters Bija-Mantra, and 10 to 20 letters as Mantras, and more than 20, as Mala-Mantra, a garland of mantras. Mantra Shastra is the science dealing with their nature and method of practicing them to obtain the expected results. Mantra-Siddhi not only enables various yogic accomplishments or attainment of psychic powers, but many phenomena of trivial nature can also be produced by it. The results are based on the relationships between vibrations, forms, and consciousness. Each letter and syllable of Sanskrit is associated with certain specific powers rooted in the highest plane of the solar system and can work on all the planes constituting it provided the mantras are correctly pronounced and the receiving agent is appropriately"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 250purified and prepared for the purpose. In a Puranic story, it is mentioned that Vritri, the Serpent Naga and an enemy of Indra, pronounced a mantra with wrong intonation and killed himself, instead of his enemy. Mantra Yoga has 16 steps finally leading to Samadhi, the highest form of meditation. Many mantras even change the nature of one's objective environment and produce miracles. Tantric literature is full of mantras capable of producing such results. The possibility of using mantras for undesirable objectives is dealt with under Black Magic. Mantras are of three kinds, viz., Sattwic (q.v.), Rajasic (q.v.), and Tamasic (qv.). Those mantras are the best which are practiced with pious thoughts for pure altruism and Sattwic results. Ordinary mantras are employed for ethically approved purposes, such as for gaining health, erudition, liberation, and other religious goals, Mantras practiced for material gains, such as power, position, wealth, and children, are of the worst kind. The silent repetition of mantras is more effective than their loud utterances, yet the purely mental repetition has the highest effect. Mantras intoned with full understanding of their meaning and comprehension of the mechanism by which they produce results is the best method of deriving full advantage of the subtler powers contained in a mantra. MANU :[From the root man, pronounced mun, to think.] The man. This name belongs to the mythological progenitors of mankind and rulers of the earth, each of whom holds sway for a Manvantara (q.v.). In Puranic stories, the first Manu was Swayambhuva, the self-existent, sometimes identified with Brahma himself. Yet it is said that Brahma divided himself into Manu and Shatrupa, one a male and another a female, for initiating sexual generation. It was done so after the Virgin Ascetics, the Kumaras (q.v.) and others, whom Brahma had created for manifestation, refused to do so. In the Bhagavad Purana, Swayambhuva Manu begot two sons, Priyavrata and Uttanapada, and three daughters, Akuti, Devahuti, and Prasuti, who were married to Ruchi Prajapati, Kardam Rishi, and Daksha Prajapati, respectively. Priyavrata was assigned the responsibility of protecting the universe; Uttanapada fathered Dhruva (q.v.) and others. Akuti gave birth to a couple who personified Vishnu and partially Lakshmi, and Devahuti gave birth to nine ascetics who produced the Saptarishis. Dhruva became the Pole Star, and the seven Rishis ruled over the seven stars of Ursa Major. Daksha Prajapati had 16 daughters from Prasuti and 60 from his another wife Asikni. During each Kalpa , 14 Manus reign. The present Varaha Kalpa began with Vishnu taking Avatara in the form of a boar when he retrieved the earth from deluge. So far 6 Manus have reigned. The present Vaivasvata Manu is the 7th one. The 6 preceding Manus were Swayambhuva, Swarochisha, Auttami, Tamasa, Raiwat, and Chakshusha. Swarochisha was the son of Agni, Auttami was the son of Priyavrata who was the eldest child of Swayambhuva Manu. Tamasa was a brother of Auttami and had saved the destruction of the Vedas, for which he is also known as Vaidhritha. During the period of Tamasa Manu, Vishnu saved the elephant which remembered him in utter desperation when it was caught by a crocodile and was unable to save itself. The 5th Manu, Raiwat, was also a brother of Tamasa. The churning of the ocean had taken place during the period of Chakshusha. Vaivasvata Manu is a son of Vivaswana, Sun. In the present period, Aditya, Vasu, Rudra, Vishwadeva, Marudagana, Ashwini Kumaras, and Ribhu are important deities, and Purandar is the name of present Indra. The 7 regents or the Saptarishis during the reign of Vaivasvata Manu are Kashyapa, Atri, Vashista, Vishwamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, and Bhardwaja. Vishnu appeared as Vamana Avatara during this Manvantara. According to the Bhagavad Purana, the 8th Manu will be Sawarni who would be a manifestation of Ashwini Kumaras. Bali, who is said to have been humbled by Vishnu in his role of Vamana Avatara and is presently ruling Sutala Loka (q.v.), will be the Indra during this period. The 9th Manu, to be known as Dakshaswarni, will be the son of Varuna. The 10th Manu will be Brahma-Sawarni, the llth"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 251Dharma-Sawarni, the 12th Rudra-Sawarni 13th Deva-Sawarni or Rauchya, and the 14th will be known as Indra-Sawami or Bhautya. Each Manu has a special role to play. Swayambhuva Manu was asked by Brahma to begin generative evolution, religiously maintain the wellbeing of the earth, and worship God by religious sacrifices, Yajnas, Swayambhuva Manu got the nebulous globe concretised, divided it into seven seas and seven continents and made proper arrangements for their progress and development. Since the very beginning, each Manu works in close collaboration with other Rishis, Pitris, Indras, Kumaras, Siddhas, and Prajapatis. They also owe special responsibilities towards ascetics, Saptarishis, and planetary deities. MANVANTARA :The interval between the reigns of two Manus. It consists of 71 Maha Yugas, equal to 306,720,000 years, (See Kala for details) MARA :The embodiment of desire, Kama. MARG, NIVRITTI AND PRAVRITTI :Nivritti Marg refers to withdrawal of consciousness from material involvement; on Pravritti Marg, the ego gradually gets immersed in the Mayavic world of illusion. These two concepts are basic to all Indian teachings. The terrestrial existence provides sensual gratification which increasingly binds the individual to involuntary births and deaths, as well as to frustrations and sorrows. Initial turning point occurs with helplessness experienced at moments of intense pain when the heart bleeds and there is no escape. Increasing introspection and the growing urge to free oneself from the pain of despair and dissolution induce the individual to delve deeper into the mysteries of nature. At such moments, the reality of the path of withdrawal dawns on him. He begins to lead a life of righteousness and controls his involuntary responses. New realities begin to dawn on his consciousness. The path of spiritual unfoldment, over a number of years, takes the individual towards his deliverance. When he consciously begins to establish voluntary control over his life, he is placed on the path of withdrawal. His spiritual teacher, at the inner plane of his psyche, takes control over him. Many mystic experiences begin to take place in him. His life becomes very intense. Often his nervous and psychological strain increases. Yet there is much satisfaction on higher levels; a sense of fullness and purpose in life takes sway over him. MARGI GATI :Accelerated direct motion. MARICHI :A ray of light. One of the mind-born (q.v.) sons of Brahma. The father of Surya, Sun, and the direct ancestor of Maha,kashyapa. The Northern Buddhists at the Yogacharya School see in Marichi a Bodhisattva. Marichi is the chief of the Marutas (q.v.) and one of the seven great Rishis. MARS :See Kuja. MARTAND :Literally means the dead egg; Sun. The Puranic stories describe that when the 8th Sun was born, Aditi (q.v.). thought him to be a lifeless egg, so the name of Martand was assigned to him. A bird produced from seemingly lifeless egg. A Vedic name for Sun, Aditya, the Sun-God. MARUDYOGA :A planetary combination formed by Jupiter in a trine house from Venus, Moon in 5th from Jupiter, and Sun in a cardinal house in respect with Moon. The combination makes the person very rich and a successful businessman. MARUTA :The storm god. The 49 sons of Diti (q.v.) who are also said to be the sons of Rudra and brothers of Indra, sons of the ocean, sons of heaven, and sons of the earth. They are armed with lightnings and thunderbolts, and ride on the whirlwind and direct the storm. The Marutas, according to Aurobindo, represent the progressive illumination of human mentality, until from the first obscure movements of mind which only emerge out of the darkness of the subconscient, are transformed into an image of the luminous consciousness of which Indra is the Purusha, the representative being. MASCULINE SIGNS :Odd signs of the zodiac, viz., Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 252MATRI KARAKA :The planet which indicates the relationship of the individual with his mother. It is important especially in Jaimini astrology. It is worked out as follows: the longitudes of planets in different signs are arranged in descending order after discarding the value (in degrees) of the sign. In this sequence, the planet fourth in order is known as Matri Karaka; the first one is Atma Karaka, the second one Amatya Karak (family relations), and the third one Bhratri Karaka (brothers). In Parashari astrology, Moon is universally considered as the Matri Karaka planet. MATSYA YOGA :A planetary combination formed by malefic and benefices both occupying the 5th house, malefic in ascendant and in 9th house, and a malefic in either the 4th or the 8th house from the ascendant. A person born under this combination is compassionate, religious, intelligent and renowned. He becomes a renowned astrologer also. MAYA :Illusion, deception. Illusion personified as a female of celestial origin; creative illusion. Sometimes identified with Durga. (q.v.) as the source of spells, or as a personification of the unreality of worldly things. In common parlance, Maya stands for wealth, women, and transience. In Vedanta, it is the matter which veils spirit. Sankaracharya stated that everything from Mahat (q.v.), cosmic intelligence, which is the first to proceed from Prakriti (q.v.) down to the gross physical body is the effect of Maya. It always exists with Avidya (q.v.), ignorance. Blavatsky considers Maya as the cosmic power which renders phenomenal existence and the perception thereof possible. Maya was also a Daitya who was the architect and artificer of the Asuras (q.v.). He dwelt in Devagiri Mountains, not very far from Delhi. His chief works were in the neighbourhood of that city where he worked for men as well as Daityas. He also built a palace for the Pandavas .

It is symbolized by a pair of fishes. Venus is exalted at 270 of it and Mercury debilitated at 150. The sign represents the feet of Kala Purusha (q.v.). Pisces makes an individual work for humanity in general, and to rise above the common folk. He is never satisfied with his conditions. In adverse relationship with Mercury, Pisces makes the individual neurotic cynical, and psychologically unbalanced. In special relationship with Venus, it produces the worst trials for the individual, especially from women, worldly pleasures, and drugs. Syn: Anthya (end), Matsya. (fish), Pritharoma (fish), Prithujugma (double fish) and jhasa (warmth as well as a large fish). MERCURY :An inferior planet like Venus since it is closer to Sun than Earth. Its mean distance from Sun is 60 million km, and its diameter is 4,850 km. Its axial rotation is the same as its sidereal period so that the same hemisphere is always presented to Sun. There are regions of permanent night on it, however there is a zone in between permanent night and permanent day, over which Sun appears to rise and set but no life is expected there. Mercury is said to own Gemini and Virgo ; it is debilitated in Pisces at 150. It is friendly with Sun, Venus, and Rahu, and is inimical with Moon, neutral with Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Sometimes Saturn is considered friendly with it. The proximity of Sun adds special significance to the planet. It is never more than 600 away from Sun. Unless it is too close to Sun, when it is considered combust thus depriving itself of its inherent qualities, an association between Mercury and Sun leads to Budha-Aditya Yoga (q.v.), which sharpens intellect. The occultists place much significance on this association as it, according to them, exalts the status of Mercury among the heavenly bodies. Blavatsky refers to this phenomenon as important so as to make Mercury the most eloquent and the most wise of all"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 253gods.

Soma, the presiding deity of Moon, had abducted and impregnated Tara, the wife of Jupiter, who gave birth to Mercury It had led to a war in heaven between the gods and the demons, and natural balance was restored only at the intercession of gods. Jupiter also accepted Mercury as his own son. Other Puranic stories refer to Mercury's changing sex several times and begetting several offspring both as a male as well as in a female form. In predictive astrology, Mercury represents intelligence, commerce, and one's own brothers. It has a tremendous adaptive capacity. It has the most suitable aptitude for ministerial and diplomatic assignments. In yogic literature, Mercury is said to be connected with Vishudhi Chakra. Syn:, Budha (learned), Chandraputra (son of Moon), Jna (the sentient soul, a wise person), Saumya (graceful), Boodha- (instructor, informer), and Atidirgha (very enduri MERU :The cup, or lotus-vessel, whose each leaf is a Dwipa (island); the mystic mount, the house of gods. The Puranas describe the height of Meru mountain as 94,000 yojanas, 16,000 yojanas of which are rooted in Earth. Meru is a name of a mythical mountain supposed to function as the centre, or navel, of Earth where swarga, or the abode of gods, exists. Geographically it is described as an unknown mountain situated north of the Himalayas. Traditionally, Meru is the 'Land of Bliss', existing since the earliest Vedic times. It is also referred to as Hemadri, the golden mountain, Ratnasanu, 'the jewel peak', Karnikachala, lotus mountain, and Amaradri or Deva Parvata, signifying the mountain of the gods.

MITRA :An ally, a Vedic deity, usually associated with Varuna, a regent of the ocean and of the western direction. Mitra in the Vedic pantheon was one of the seven earliest Adityas presiding over day, calling all to activity, beholding all with an unwinking eye, sustaining earth and sky. Mitra is the presiding deity over Anuradha, the 17th asterism, and Varuna is that of Satbhisag . Aurobindo states that Mitra is the harmoniser, the builder, the constituent light, the god who effects the right unity, of which Varuna is the substance and the infinitely self-enlarging periphery.

It is said that his father once wanted his wife Renuka to be beheaded because she had entertained an impure thought. None of his sons except Parasurama obeyed him. When his father's anger subsided, he granted Parasurama a boon for his obedience. The kindhearted son begged that his mother be restored to life (again), which the father granted readily. On another occasion, when the son of Karatavirya killed Jamadagni, Parasurama vowed to extricate the entire Kshatriya race. He is said to have done so twenty-one times. He was defeated by Rama (q.v.).

Some important ascetic yogas are as follows: (1) Four or more planets in strength occupying a single house with Raja Yoga (q.v.) present in the horoscope. The type of asceticism depends upon the strongest planet in the combination. Mars produces Sakyas who worshipped Devi, the goddess of power; Mercury produces Jeevikas who worshipped Vishnu, the preserver of the universe; Jupiter makes the person a Bhikshu, a mendicant, -professing Samkhya philosophy. Moon makes Vriddhas who believe in Supreme God and go around begging alms with a skull-like pot. Saturn produces Nirgranthas who roam naked like the Nagas (q.v.); and Sun makes a person Vanyasana who believe in simple living and high thinking, possessing high intellect and is spiritually developed. (2) The lord of Moon sign with no aspect on itself, aspects Saturn; or Saturn aspects the lord of the sign occupied by Moon which is also weak. (3) Moon occupies drekkan (q.v.) of Saturn and is expected by it. Such an individual renounces the world and mundane relationships. (4) Moon occupies the navamsa of Saturn or Mars, and is expected by Saturn. Such a person is disenchanted with mundane existence and leads the life of a recluse.

PLANETS :A planet is a non-luminous globe of relatively small mass, revolving round a star, a globe of incandescent gas. The only planets of which there is any knowledge are those in the solar system. There are nine planets in this system, viz., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, arranged according to their distance from the central star of this system, viz., Sun. In astrological studies, Earth is not taken into account, but Sun and Moon (which is a satellite of Earth) are included. The Vedic astrology does not include the trans-Saturnian planets, viz., Uranus (also known as Herschel), Neptune and Pluto, but it includes the Nodes of Moon, viz., Rahu and Ketu, for prognostication purposes. These planets are divided into two well-marked groups: the inner consists of three relatively smaller ones (viz., Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) and the outer five giants, viz., Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and -Pluto. Between the two groups lies the main asteroid zone consisting of about 45,000 small 'worlds' moving round Sun whose orbits lie in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

They took to wife Marisha, a daughter of Kanclu, and Daksha was their son, when he was born in another Manvantara (q.v.). But in another Manvantara, the 27 daughters of Daksha (cf. Asterisms) were married to Soma, Moon, whose emanation was Marishi who is referred to as mother of Daksha. Thus Prachetas were Daksha's father as well as his great grandson.

These terms in general mean control and regulation of the flow of the Vital Air (Prana Vayu) which has its source in Sun (or Fohat). Pranayama distributes the Vital Air to the different Chakras (energy centres). It enters Swadhistan or the spleenic energy centre which differentiates it into five different channels and distributes them to the different energy centres.

These points slowly move backward. This is known as precision of equinoxes. The slow change in the direction of Earth's axis of rotation, mainly due to the attraction of Sun and Moon on the equatorial bulge of Earth, produces the precision of equinoxes. As a result, the Celestial Pole describes circles among the stars; each circle is 470 in diameter, and completes the whole length of the circumference or the lunar attraction on the equatorial bulge of the Earth tending to push the polar axis towards the axis of the ecliptic causes equinoctial Precision entire zodiacal belt in about 25,800 years: It implies that the precision of equinoxes covers one zodiac sign in approximately 2,160 years. It also leads to a shift in the position of the North Pole.

(2) If Venus occupies the 9th house, Moon the7th house, Mars the 8th, and Jupiter owns the 2nd house or the ascendant while the ascendant is in a fixed sign. The person born in this combination lives always in servitude.

Rahu is said to be born of Viprachitti and Sinhika. He is said to have four arms and his torso ends in a serpenVs tail. The Puranas describe his deceit to obtain nectar at the conclusion of the churning of the ocean. He mingled among the gods and drank a few drops of it. Sun and Moon detected him doing so and informed Vishnu who then cut off his head and two of his arms. But as he had secured immortality, his body was placed in the stellar sphere, the upper part of which represents Rahu and the lower part Ketu. Rahu is also called Abhra-Pisacha, the demon of the sky, as well as Bharani-bhu, born from the asterism Bharani. The exaltation sign of Rahu is Taurus.

RAJAPADA YOGA :An auspicious combination formed by Moon and ascendant in Vargottam (q.v.) Navamsa, and four or more planets expecting them. It makes the individual head of a state or its equivalent. RAJAS :(Rajas = activity energy, agitation). One of the primeval attributes, Gunas (q.v.), of activity, the other two being Sattwa (harmony) and Tanzas (inertia or darkness). Rajas impulse arouses ambition for worldly status and involvement in material existence. RAJARISHI :A sage of Kshatriya (regal) caste raised to the spiritual status through pure and austere life on earth to that of a demigod, e.g., Vishwamittra, Pururava, and Janaka.

RAJJU YOGA :A planetary combination formed by all planets in movable signs. The combination makes the individual born under it to settle in a foreign country. He is generally unjust and engages in illegal activities. RAKSHASAS :The 49th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.). It is ruled by Rudra. Persons born during this year are fond of foul food, hunting, liquor and antisocial activities. The word, however, refers to evil spirits but not, all of them are equally bad and harmful. They are grouped in three categories, viz., (i) the Yakshas who have a special task of testing the spiritual nature of saints and sages, (ii) the Titans who are the enemies of gods and are generally at war with them, and (iii) the usual demons and fiends who haunt burial grounds, disturb sacrifices (yajnas), harass devout men and afflict mankind in several ways. The Rakshasas are the descendants of sage Pulastya (q.v.). According to some scriptures they sprang from Brahma's foot. The Vishnu Purana describes them the descendants of Kashyapa (q.v.) and Khasa, a daughter of Daksha (q.v.). The word Rakshasa is derived from the root raksha, meaning to guard. Based on this derivation, some scriptures associate Rakshasas with Brahma who made them guard the waters. RAKSHASLOKA :One of the 8 Lokas (q.v.) recognized by Sankhya and Vedanta schools of philosophy where the Rakshasas dwell. RAKTAKSHI :The 58th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.).

RAMA :Three Ramas have been described in the Hindu scriptures, viz., (1) Parasurama , (2) Ramachandra, the son of Dasharatha, and (3) Balarama, the elder brother of Krishna. It is the second Rama who is generally referred to by this name. He said to be the 7th avatar (q.v.) of Vishnu and made his appearance in the world at the end of Treta Yuga. He was born to Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya, and Kaushalya. He was the eldest of four brothers. While still very young Vishwamitra sought his help to protect his Yajnas and other religious observances from the Rakshasas. Later, the sage took him to the court of Janaka, the king of Videha where Rama won the hand of the princess Sita in a Swayamvara. On the eve of his coronation, his father banished him from the kingdom for 14 years in order to fulfil a promise given to one of his wives, Kaikeyi. He obediently left with his wife and younger brother Lakshamana to the forest. Sita was abducted by Ravana and Rama had to kill him in a war in order to rescue his wife. Upon the completion of his exile, he returned to Ayodhya but a foul remark from one of his subjects about Sita forced him to send her, in spite of her pregnancy, to the forests. There, in the ashram of Valmiki, she delivered twins, Kusa and Lava. Later, Rama recognised them as his sons, but to prove her purity to the subjects, Sita asked her mother, Earth, to accept her in her bosom if she were pure. The legend says Earth opened itself and swallowed her. Soon afterwards, Rama also left for his celestial abode."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 271RAMAYANA :The epic authored by Valmiki describing the life and glory of Ramachandra, the king of Ayodhya.

He became a great menace, and it is said that his evil deeds cried aloud for vengeance. Vishnu took avatar as Rama to destroy him. While Rama was in exile in a forest, Ravana abducted his wife, Sita, and this led to a war in which Ravana was killed. Ravana was a descendant of Sage Pulastya and was a Brahinin by caste. He is described as having ten heads, twenty arms, copper-colored eyes and teeth bright like the young Moon. He looked like a thick cloud and appeared to be the god of death. He had all the marks of royalty, but his body bore the impress of wounds inflicted by all the divine arms. He was well versed in religious scriptures and performed all Vedic rituals. When he died his body was cremated with Brahmanic rites. RAVI YOGA {A combination of planets formed by Sun in the 10th house and the lord of the 10th house in 3rd house along with Saturn. It makes the individual born with this combination a scientist who attains a powerful status in administration. He eats very little, is much occupied with his studies, and is greatly respected. RECEPTION :Planetary relationship formed by two planets situated in one another's signs. It is also known as Parivartan. RECTIFICATION :The method of correcting the true time of nativity is known as the rectification of horoscope. There are various methods to examine the correctness of a given natal chart; it is an important professional tool. REGIOMONTANUS' SYSTEM :Regiomontanus (Johann Muller) was a 15th-century German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer. He died under mysterious circumstances. He formulated a system of house division for different latitudes, replacing the earlier method. Presently, this system is not in vogue except in some parts of Germany. In this system, the great circles intersect the celestial equator at equal distances of 300. They intersect the, ecliptic at points considered as the cusps of the houses. These divisions begin from the horizon, and the meridian is also one of the dividing circles. Therefore the ascendant, descendant, M.C. and I.C. in this system are identical with those of the other systems. REKHA YOGA :A planetary combination leading to poverty. It arises when a weak lord of ascendant is expected by the lord of the 8th house, and Jupiter is combust (q.v.) by Sun. Alternatively, if the lord of Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 4th house is obscured by Sun while Sun itself is expected by the lord of the 12th house. RETROGRESSION :The movement of a planet in the direction opposite to that of Earth. It is an apparent retrogression, not an actual change in direction. It occurs due to the relative position of Earth and the planet though the both may actually be moving in the same"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 273direction. The difference in the speed of Earth and the planet gives the illusion (see diagram).' REVATI :The 27th asterism extending from 3460 40' to 3600 00' of the zodiac. It is ruled by Mercury. Its presiding deity is Pushan. Revati is Sattwic. It is classified Brahmin by class, elephant by species, god by temperament, aquatic by animal type and is related with the eastern direction. Its primary motivation comes from Moksha. Two fishes lying in opposite directions symbolize it. It is said to be leonine in majesty and tender in its impact. Revati also stands for Balarama's wife. The legend says that she was so beautiful that her father, King Raivata, sought Brahma's advice about a possible husband for her. He directed the king to Dwarka where Balarama, as a portion of Vishnu, had to take birth as the elder brother of Krishna. Raivata went and offered him Revati's hand but Balarama beholding her as excessively tall, shortened her with the end of his ploughshare, and she became his wife. Revati also stands for the Great Womb in which Sun dwells in dormancy until the impulse for the next Manvantaric cycle begins. It is the Great Deluge where the seeds for future creations incubate until the following Cosmic Dawn. Revati expands human consciousness and provides depth to one's spiritual understanding. RISHI :An inspired poet, a sage. It refers to Vedic seers who spend much time in meditation, live in forests, and impart spiritual training to disciples who live with them in their hermitage. The Rishis were also concerned with leading mankind towards spiritual regeneration and enlistment. Three levels of Rishis, viz., Devarishis, Brahmarishis, and Rajarishis are mentioned in the religious scriptures. The Seven Regents of the world, the Saptarishis (q.v.), are said to have a special role in the manifestation of the universe. ROHINI :A red cow; a girl who has just begun menstruating.

Its symbol is chariot and its primary motivation comes from Moksha. Rohini is considered a trader by class, a serpent by species, a man by temperament, a quadruped by animal type, and is related with the eastern direction. It is Dhruva, or steadfast, in its impact. Rohini prepares the individual and the world for the dawn of a new awakening, the arrival of a new spiritual influx and a radical change in one's life. The asterism directs the individual towards the physical world of illusion with all its glamour, luxuries and sensual gratification. ROHITA :Red. A red horse. A horse in the chariot of Sun, and it also refers to one of the flames of Agni, fire. Rohita is the name of a deity celebrated in the Atharva Veda, representing a form of fire or Sun. Harishchandra, who was one of the ancestors of Rama (q.v.) and a king of the solar dynasty, renowned for his truthfulness had a son named Rohita whose death proved to be the greatest trial for Harishchandra but he came out triumphant in his conflict between emotion and duty. RUDHIRODGARI :The 57th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatasara. It is ruled by Rudra. A person born in this year suffers from blood diseases and lives a shady life. RUDRA :[Rudra = a howler; a roared; terrible]. Rudra is the howling god of storms who presides over Ardra, the 6th asterism. As a destructive deity, Rudra brings diseases upon men and cattle, yet as a beneficent deity he has exceptional healing powers. Rudras are said to be the ten vital breaths (Pranas) with Manas, mind, as eleventh. He is supposed to have arisen from the forehead of Brahma. Mention has also been made of 11 Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Surabhi. Some of the names given to Rudra by Brahma are Bhava, Sarva, Ishana, Pashupati, Bhima, Ugra and Mahadeva."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 274Rudra. is also the name of the 54th year in the cycle of 60 Samvatsara (q.v.).

It is ruled by Shiva. Persons born during this year become businessmen, religious and dutiful, and are satisfied even with meager return to their efforts. SADHUA holy saint or a sage. SAHAMAA concept important in the Tajaka system of annual predictions. It refers to special planetary combinations due to interplanetary distances between certain planets. Sahama gives certain sensitive points in relation with special aspects of life. It is worked out on the basis of longitudes of several planets, the ascendant and other sensitive points in a natal chart. Around 119 such points are identified in Tajaka Astrology: 50 by Neelakantha, 48 by Venkatesh, and 21 by Keshava. Some of these are very effective, e.g., Punya, Yasha and Mahatmya Sahamas. SAHASRARA:Also known as Brahmarandhra ' or Crown Chakra. It is said to be located in the topmost portion of the head. In Yogic literature, it is described as the apex of seven Chakras connected with Serpent Fire or the Kundalini (q.v.). It contains 960 radiations of primary force. To clairvoyants it resembles a thousand-petal led lotus. Full arousal of this energy center enables an individual to attain spiritual illumination. SAKATA YOGA:An inauspicious planetary combination described variously in classical texts. Varahamihira, in Vrihada-jataka, defines it as formed by all the planets in the 1st and 7th houses which make the individual accept low professions. Vaidyanath Dixita, in Jataka Parijatam, states it to occur when Jupiter occupies the 6th or 8th position from Moon posited in a house other than the cardinal houses in relation with the ascendant. It brings poverty even to those born in a royal family. Such a person is troubled throughout his life and is disliked by the head of the state. Mantreswara, in Phaladeepika, mentions that Moon in the 12th, 8th or 6th house from Jupiter causes Sakata Yoga unless Moon is situated in a cardinal house. A person with this combination loses his wealth or position in life, but regains them. Sakata Yoga produces cyclic fluctuation in fortune, just like the wheel of a chariot, rotating on its axis. SAKSHI:A witness. The subjective center of the being, often referred to as Atma, watching the actions of the individual in his personal and public life. (See Sankhya philosophy) SAMYOGA:Conjunction of planets. SAMA:Balanced. The natural state of a planet when it is neither debilitated nor exalted. In Yogic literature, it means control of mind. SAMA-SAPTAKA:Planets occupying the 1st and 7th houses in relation with one another. SAMADHI:Highest state of meditation practice. A process of diving into the deepest layers of one's consciousness. It is the ultimate state of the eightfold steps of Yoga: the eight steps in this system are self-restraint Nina), fixed observances or following self-discipline (Niyama), right posture (Asana), regulation of breath (Pranayama), abstraction, withdrawal from and renunciation of worldly attractions (Pratyahara), concentration and holding on to one idea or object in mind (Dharana), meditation (Dhyana) and merging of individual consciousness in Universal 'Life (Samadhi). There are several kinds of Samadhis, such as, Asamprajnata Samadhi, Dharma-Megha Samadhi, Nirbij Sanzadlii, Nirvichara Samadhi, Nirvitarka Samadhi, Sabija Samadhi, Samprajnata Samadhi, Savichara Samadhi, Savitarka Samadhi, etc. Details of different kinds of Samadhi and steps to accomplish them are given in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. SAMBANDHA:Planetary relationships, viz., conjunction aspect, and interchange of houses, etc. SANGAMA:Conjunction of planets. SAMPATA:Equinox."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 275SAMPATA BINDU:Equatorial point. SAMRAJYA YOGA:A planetary combination formed by the lord of the Navamsa sign of the lord of the 9th house, along with Jupiter in the 2nd house. It makes the individual a top-ranking administrative officer living in luxury. SAMUDRA YOGA:A planetary combination formed by all planets in even houses such as the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., while odd houses, such as the 1st, 3rd, etc., are vacant. It bestows much renown on the individual and he is provided with all conveniences of life. SAMVATSARA:A lunar year which starts from the first day of the bright half of Chaitra month (Chaitra Shukla Pratipada). Two most prevalent Samvatsaras are Vikrama samavat and Sakabda or Saka samvat. The latter is obtained by deducting 135 years from the former. [In A.D. 1998, Vikrama 2055, samvat began on March 28.] Samvatsaras are grouped in a cycle of 60 years, also known as the Jovian Cycle. The names of different Samvats in the cycle are given below. Details of the persons born during different Samvatsaras are given under their respective names. Two most common methods for identifying the name of the year in which a person is born are given below: (A) Multiply the Saka Samvat by 22, add 4291 to the product and divide the result by 1875. Add the quotient to the given Samvatsara, neglecting the remainder. Again divide the total by 60. Upon adding one to the remainder, neglecting the quotient, we will get the Samvatsara's position in the cyclic order. For example, the given samavat is 1902. 1902 x 22 = 41844 41844 + 4291 = 46135 46135/1875 = 24 (Remainder 1135 is disregarded) 24 + 1902 = 1926 1926/60 = 32, quotient is disregarded, and the remainder is 6. 6 increased by 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. The 7th Samvatsara in the cyclic order given in the table shows Shrimukh as the year. (B) Another method relative to Vikrama Samvatsara is given below: Add 9 to the Vikrama Samvatsara, divide the total by 60 and add 1 to the remainder. It would indicate the number in the cyclic order. For example the given Vikram samvat is 2037. 2037 +9 = 2046 2046/60 - Quotient 54, remainder 6 6 + 1 = 7; the 7th in the is Shrimukh. The cycle of 60 Samvatsara sometimes grouped in 5 comprising 12 Samvatsara, category. These categories Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Anuvatsara, and Idavatsara usual cyclic order, th Samvatasaras are ruled b the second 20 by Vishnu and the third 20 by Shiva see Table below.

Kshaya SANDHI:Boundary, limit; morning and evening twilight; daybreak or dawn and dusk either of a day or a yuga (q.v.) or a manvantara (q.v.), meeting point of two different groups. It also refers to the last 24 minutes of a lunar day (tithi), as well as to the last 2 minutes of a zodiacal sign and the last 24 seconds of a Navamsa. SANDHYA:Twilight. In some scriptures, Sandhya is personified as the daughter of Brahma and wife of Shiva. In one of the Puranic stories, Brahma is said to have attempted to seduce his daughter, but she changed herself into a deer. He pursued her in the sky assuming the form of a stag. When Shiva saw this injustice, he shot an arrow to cut off the stag's head. The arrow is said to remain in the sky as Ardra, the 6th asterism, and the stag's head as Mrigashirsha, the 5th asterism. SANDHYA DASA:A kind of planetary - ruler ship over the life of an individual. SANGITHA KANDA:A system of astrological prediction based on factors such as the planetary combinations at the beginning of a Samvatsara (q.v.), appearance of a comet, presence of omens, birth-marks, nature of the breathing when a query is made and such other unusual occurrences. SANI:The planet Saturn. Its regent is represented as a dark man in black garments with a black vulture as its stead. Sani is represented in the legends as a son of Sun and Chhaya but according to another scripture he is said to be an offspring of Balarama and Revati. Saturn's mean distance from Sun is 886,100,000 miles. Its sidereal period is 29.46 years, the period of axial rotation is 10 hours and 48 minutes, and equatorial diameter 75,100 miles. Its mass is 95 times heavier than that of Earth. Its maximum surface temperature is -2400F. It has an unique system of rings made up of small particles revolving round Saturn in the manner of dwarf Moons but looking like a solid sheet. (Recent explorations indicate that some outer planets also seem to have such rings.) The rings of Saturn measure 170,000 miles end to end, but are not more than 10 miles thick. Saturn has nine satellites, the largest being Titan which has a diameter of over 3,000 miles and is known to possess an atmosphere composed chiefly of methane. Astrologically, Saturn is a malefic. It obscures the spiritual impulses of Sun, pushes them inward and makes the individual grossly materialistic. Saturn's aspect on the 9th house in a natal chart, and on Moon, Sun and the ascendant makes an individual ascetic and desirous of inner illumination, often resulting in serious psychological setbacks. Saturn rules over Capricorn and Aquarius; the latter is also its trine sign. It is exalted in Libra and debilitated in Aries. It is related with the north-eastern direction. Saturn produces Sasa Yoga (q.v.) and Parivrajya Yogas (q.v.). SANJNA:Spiritual consciousness; Gayatri. Daughter of Vishwakarma and a wife of Sun. SANKHYA:Pronounced as Sunkhya, it means numbers, digits, but pronounced as Saankhya it means relating to numbers and refers to one of the 6 systems of Hindu philosophy attributed to sage Kapil. It enumerates 25 Tattwas and aims at the emancipation of the individual from the thralldom of these elements so that Purusha is released from the fetters of phenomenal existence. The release comes from the true knowledge of the 24 elements (besides Purusha) and properly comprehending the nature of Purusha or Atman as distinct from him. Sankhya philosophy regards the whole universe an expression of Prakritti , Purusha being a passive onlooker, a sakshi . Sankhya agrees with Vedanta in being a synthesis while differs from Nyaya and Vaiseshika (q.v.), which are primarily analytical. Sankhya differs from Vedanta in its assumption of two separate"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 277principles as Purusha and Prakriti; it also does not assume a Supreme Reality as the Creator of the entire existence, which is postulated in Vedanta. SANKHYAYOGA:Depending upon the number of signs occupied by the seven planets (excluding the nodes), Sankhya Yoga is formed. The different combinations formed by the number of houses occupied afe given different names, viz., (a) Vina Yoga (seven signs occupied); (b) Dama Yoga (six signs occupied); (c) Pasha Yoga (five signs occupied); (d) Kedar Yoga (four signs occupied); (e) Shula Yoga (three signs occupied); (f) Yuga Yoga (two signs occupied); and (g) Gola Yoga (one sign occupied). These combinations produce results when any other yoga formed by such combinations. eg. Chap Yoga, Kshetri Yoga, Nav Yoga, etc. do not occur. Results of the various combinations of Sankhya Yogas are given under their respective names. SANKRANTI:Passage from one point to another. The passage of Sun or any planet from one zodiacal sign to another. (This term should not be confused with Krantivrita which means Ecliptic or with Kranti Pradesh which refers to the Zodiac.) SANGAMA:Coming together; conjunction of planets. SANYAS:Asceticism. Renunciation of worldly relationships. The fourth or the last stage of a Brahmins religious life. (See also Pravraiya Yoga) SAPTA:Seven; a sacred number; many compounds proceed there from. It also refers to the seven planets excluding the nodes. SAPTASLAKA:A term used in Jaimini Astrology. It indicates the mutual intervention, Vedha, between different planets. Seven vertical lines and seven horizontal lines drawn intersecting one another would give 28 (i.e., 7 X 4 = 28) terminals of the two sets of seven intersecting lines. These terminals are marked seriatim beginning with 1 as the second topmost terminal on the left-hand side and continuing upward and turning right hand top terminals till one comes to 21st terminal. The terminal after 21 is assigned zero followed by 22 number. The 27 numbers represent the asterisms in the same order beginning with Ashwini as 1. On the basis of this chart one can find out whether the two planets have vedha or nullifying relationship between them. For example, if in a natal chart Saturn is in Moolam which is the 19th asterism and Venus is in Punar-vasu which is the 7th asterism, one finds that 19 and 7 are terminals of the same straight line, so they nullify the effect of one another. This diagram is used for various other purposes as well SAPTAMSA:Seventh part (1 / 7) of a zodiacal sign. Each part of it is ruled by a planet. The lordship of different parts of odd signs (q.v.) begin with the ruler ship of the planet owning the given sign itself and each subsequent part is ruled by the lord of the subsequent sign. For even signs, the sequence starts from the ruler ship of the 8th house from it. The deities presiding over the various divisions are Kshara (water), Kshira (milk), Dahi (curd), Aajya (clarified butter, ghee), Ikshura (sugarcane), Madya (wine), and Sudhajala (pure drinking water). SAPTARISHI:The seven regents of the earth. As stars they represent the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). They are also called the Riksha and Chitra Sikhandinas (meaning the bright crested). (See Rishi) SAPTAVARGA BALA:Sevenfold strength of a planet.

This shift is taken into account in the delineation of heavenly bodies in the Western system of astrological predictions, while the Hindu (or the Vedic) system considers the positions of planets without taking into account the precession. The difference between the Sayana and Nirayana (without taking precession into account) planetary delineations is the extent of precession, which in the year 1998 was approximately (Mean) 230 49' 45\".

Calculations relating to the possibility of having an offspring. Three important sphutas are considered in this regard: (i) Beeja (seed) sphuta, (ii) Kshetra (field) sphuta, and (iii) Putra tithi (opportune date for impregnation) sphuta. Beeja sphuta is obtained by adding the longitude of Sun, Venus and Jupiter in the husband's chart. The sum indicates a sign and its Navamsa. If both of these are in odd signs, virility is present and the chances of an offspring are good. If both are in even signs, virility and the chance of progeny are both absent. If one is odd and the other is even, the progeny may   be   delayed.   Kshetra sphuta is worked out by adding the longitudes of Jupiter, Moon and Mars in the wife's natal chart. If the sign and Navamsa thus obtained are both in even signs, fertility and chances of progeny are assured. In case both are in odd signs, the progeny will be delayed or even denied. If one is odd and the other is even, there may be a delay but the progeny can be expected. Putra tithe sphuta is decisive in progeny prediction. It is determined as follows: Multiply the longitudes of natal Moon and Sun separately by 5, subtract the result obtained from Sun from that of Moon, and convert the result into degrees, minutes, etc. Divide it by 12. The quotient plus 1 gives the tithe required. If this is less than 15, it is deemed to be in the dark half, and if the remainder is less than 6, the tithe is in the first half. If it is more than 6, it would be in the second half. Impregnation during this period has greater chance of fertilization. STAMBHAN:Stillness of a planet when it changes its course either due to retrogression or of direct motion STARS, FIXED:Asterisms (q.v.), also known as Lunar Mansions and Nakshatras.

Generally the watches are set to indicate the mean solar time which has a longer constant equal to the annual mean of true solar days. In order to find out the true solar time, equation of time is used which is provided by the corresponding difference for a given moment, between the mean time and the true time. This difference is generally given in Ephemeris's, for the midday's. Thus the equation of time (±15 mins.) signifies that the true Sun passes the Meridian within the given difference. TITHI/LUNAR DAY :The are covered by Moon in its transit away from Sun, computed for the moment of its conjunction with Sun to its true longitude at the moment of the epoch. It is obtained by subtracting the Longitude of Sun from the longitude of Moon.

The longitudes and their positions in a natal chart are calculated according to well-established rules. They produce results like other results. UPANISHADS :Esoteric doctrine. The Upanishads are ancient religious discourses between the seer teachers and their earnest disciples. Many of the Upanishads form parts of the Vedas. There are probably more than 150 of these works. The objective of these treatises is to ascertain the mystic sense of the Vedic texts, so they enter into such abstruse questions as the origin of the universe, the nature of the deity, the nature of soul, and the connection between mind and matter. The discourses, often in the form of dialogues, are aimed at arousing the intuitive understanding of the wisdom rather than laying down well-defined doctrines. The word 'Upanishad' signifies \"seating together\" as well as \"that which destroys ignorance and leads to liberation.\" The central theme of all Upanishads is to provide an insight into this liberating principle. The Rig Veda has an Upanishad called Aitreya. The Taittiriya Samhita of the Yajur Veda has an Upanishad of the same name. The Vajasaneyi Samhita has the Ishopanishad, and attached to the Shatapatha Brahmana it has the Brihad Aranyaka. Sama Veda has the Kena and Chhandogya.

The remaining 12 asterisms are divided into four group of 3 asterisms each. For the first group, this malefic influence pervades the first 8 ghatis of Vishakha, 8 ghatis after the 52 ghatis of Anuradha, and 10 ghatis after the 20 ghatis in Jyeshtha. In other words, for the first 15 asterisms the latter half of the Amsakas fall in Aries, the last ghatis of Amsakas fall in Scorpio, and the 9 ghatis after 6 ghatis for the Amsakas fall in Capricorn and form the Ushanasika period. For the remaining asterisms, from Vishakha to Revati, the first 8 ghatis of the Amsakas falling in Aries, the last 8 ghatis of the Amsakas falling in Scorpio, and the last 10 ghatis of Amsakas falling in Capricorn are Ushanasika period. The malignant influence of this malefic influence is avoided in all considerations under horary and elect ional (muhurtha) astrology. While examining charts in relation with diseases, accidents, losses, if the Ushanasika is taken into account, much accuracy is ordinarily claimed. UTTAM-VARGA :Auspicious situation.

In Padma Purana, she is described as a daughter of Daksha, the wife of Kashyapa, and the mother of Gandharvas and Apsaras. Blavatsky calls her 'the female logos'. Astrologically, the 2nd house in a natal chart represents the house of Vach. VAHAN :A stead, a vehicle, a chariot, an animal which can be ridden.

In Ayurveda, Vayu (or Prana) is one of the three humours of the physical system of the human body, the other two being kapha (phlegm) and pitta (bile). VEDA [Root: vid, to know or Divine knowledge]. Divine knowledge. The four ancient scriptures of the Hindus, whose antiquity has not yet been decidedly affirmed, -are probably the oldest records of human thought. They are known as Srutis, i.e., what is heard or revealed as distinguished from Smritis, i.e., what is memorised and considered as the composition of human origin. Each hymn of the Vedas bears the name of a Rishi to whom the hymn is supposed to have been revealed. The compilation of the Vedas is attributed to Krishna Dwaipayana, or Vedavyasa, but he regards himself merely as \"the compiler\" and not the composer. The Vedas are said to have emanated like breath from Brahma, who is regarded as the soul of the universe. All the Vedic writings are classified in two great divisions, viz., exoteric and esoteric: the Karma-Kanda, 'the department of action’ the ceremonials, and the Jnana-Kanda, 'the department of wisdom.\" The hymns and prayers come under the first, and the philosophical speculations of the Brahmans, especially of the Upanishads, under the second division. All are alike Srutis or revelations. Mantras, or Samhitas, and the Brahmanas are two distinct parts of the Vedas. To the Brahmanas are added the Aranyakas and Upanishads, mystical treasures which speculate upon the nature of Spirit and of God, and"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 294exhibit a freedom of thought and ;peculation which give rise to various systems of Indian philosophy. According to traditional belief, the Vedas are Apaurushaya, 'not of human origin,' so these are considered Srutis in their entirety, and the Rishis whose names are associated with different hymns are those seers to whom the hymns and mantras were revealed. The Vedas are four in number, viz., Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva. The first three, according to Manu, have been \"'milked out as it were from fire, air, and Sun.\" The Rig Veda is the oldest one; chief among the deities invoked are Agni, Indra or Vayu, and Surya. Among others Pitras, the heavenly fathers, Aditi , Varuna, Ushas (q.v.), Ashwinaus , Marutas , and Rudras can be included. Aurobindo has suggested that the Vedic presentation of divine wisdom needs a fresh look. He states: \"The hypothesis I propose is that the Rig Veda is itself the one considerable document that remains to us from the early period of human thought of which the historic Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries were the failing remnants, when the spiritual and psychological knowledge of the race was concealed, for reasons now difficult to determine, in a veil of concrete and material figures and symbols which protected the sense from the profane and revealed it to the initiated. One of the leading principles of the mystics was the sacredness and secrecy of self-knowledge and the true knowledge of the Gods. This wisdom was, they thought, unfit, perhaps even dangerous to the ordinary human mind or in any case liable to perversion and misuse and loss of virtue if revealed to vulgar and unpurified spirits. Hence they favoured the existence of an outer worship, effective but imperfect, for the profane, an inner discipline for the initiate, and clothed their language in words and images which had, equally, a spiritual sense for the elect, a concrete sense for the mass of ordinary worshippers. The Vedic hymns were conceived and constructed on this principle. Their formulas and ceremonies are, overtly, the details of an outward ritual devised for the Pantheistic Nature Worship which was then the common religion, covertly the sacred words, the effective symbols of a spiritual experience and knowledge and a psychological discipline of self-culture which were then the highest achievement of the human race.\" (Cf. The Secret of the Veda, pp. 5-6) VEDANGA :[Veda + Angas = the members of the main body]. Constituents of the Vedas. Six in number, necessary for understanding and proper sacrificial employment of the Vedas are (i) Sikshas, the science of pronunciation, (ii) Chandas, the science of prosody, (iii) Vyakarana, the grammar, (iv) Nirukta, etymology or glossary, (v) Jyotisha, astronomy and astrology, and (vi) Kalpa, the rituals. VEDANTA :Esoteric and deeper teachings of the Vedas as propounded in the Upanishads and such other systems of thought.

Vishnu is the embodiment of Sattwa Guna (q.v.). As a preserving and restoring power, he manifested himself to the world in a variety of forms, called avataras (q.v.).

The Rig Veda described him as the one \"all-seeing god, who has on every side eyes, faces, arms, and feet, who when creating heaven and earth, shapes them with his arms and wings; the father, generator, disposer, who knows all worlds, gives the gods their names, and is beyond the comprehension of mortals.\" In the Vedic hymns, he is said to sacrifice himself or to himself, which the commentators, the Nirukta, explained to imply that Vishwakarman first of all offered up all worlds in a general sacrifice (Sarvamedha) and ended by sacrificing himself. He is the artificer of the gods as well as the maker of their weapons. He revealed the science of architecture and mechanics (Sthapatya-veda). According to Puranic descriptions, Vishwakarma was the son of Prabhasa, the eighth Vasu, by his wife Yoga-Siddha. His daughter Sanjna (q.v.) was married to Sun. As Sanjna was unable to bear the effulgence of Sun in his primeval radiance, Vishwakarman sheared his rays, from which he formed the discus of Vishnu, the trident of Shiva, the weapons of Kubera, the lance of Kartikeya, and the weapons of several other gods. Vishwakarman is also represented as having made the great idol of Jagannatha. In his creative capacity, he is also designated as a Prajapati, and is said to be a mind-born son of Brahma.

Vishwamitra felt that Vashishtha's supremacy and power ensued from his Brahmanic origin so he engaged himself in severe penance, tapas, and finally succeeded in his efforts. His austerities made Indra nervous lest he usurp Indra's throne. Menaka, a celestial nymph, was sent to distract Vishwamitra from his tapas, in which she succeeded. Their amour resulted in the birth of Shakuntala (immortalised by Kalidasa in an epic of same name) who gave birth to Bharata who lent his name to India and made it known as Bharatvarsha. Vishwamitra finally attained so much of spiritual power that he sent Trishanku alive to the heavenly world. Vishwamitra was an early teacher of Rama whom he took away at an' early age to his hermitage to get rid of Rakshasas (and to impart to Rama valuable lessons in arms). He was a priest of the solar dynasty of kings yet he put Harishchandra, who belonged to this lineage and had taken a vow of absolute truthfulness, to immense hardships to test his will to uphold his vow.

Yajnavalkya was an early teacher of this meditational practice, whose name is also associated with Shatapatha Brahmana of Yajur Veda, Brihad Aranyaka and several other works on the subject. YOGINI :A sorceress. Yoginis are eight female demons attending on Durga. The term also refers to a female practitioner of yoga. YOGINI DASA :Refers to a system of Dasas. Yogini Dasa, which are eight in number, are Mangala, Pingala, Dhanya, l3hramari, Bhadrika, Ulka, Siddha, and Sankata. The prevailing Yogini Dasa at birth can be worked out by counting the number of birth-asterism, adding 3 to it, and dividing the total by 8. The remainder gives the Yogini Dasa to commence. The planets and the number of years assigned to them under this system are as follows: Moon-1; Sun-2; Jupiter-3; Mars-4; Mercury-5; Saturn-6; Venus-7; and Rahu-8.

A Day of Brahma consists of 4,320,000,000 mortal years with an equal length of Pralaya or Night of Brahma. An Age of Brahma or Maha Kalpa equals 100 years of Brahma at 3,110,400,000,000 years each. The total is given as the period of a solar universe during its Manvantara, with probably an equal period of dissolution or rest. It is said that only about 5,000 years have so far advanced in the Kali Yuga of the Fifth Race, with 4,27,000 years pending. The periods spent in the subtler ages are enormously longer than those spent in the grosser. The Yugas apply to every division of manifestation from a planetary chain to birth and decay of a nation. There is a definite overlapping of racial Yugas. Ages, cycles, Yugas are not measured by physical changes but by stages of consciousness and many factors may affect the duration.

In the case of Moon, the deviation is only ± 50. This belt is divided into 12 equal parts of 300 each, represented by individual signs ± called a Rasi (q.v.) or the sign of zodiac. Sayana or tropical signs of the zodiac start from the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the celestial equator, while Nirayana or the sidereal zodiac (q.v.) starts from the fixed origin The tropical longitude of any planet minus precession or ayanamsa (q.v.) on any specific date gives the Nirayana longitude of the planet. There is no universal agreement on the meeting point of the Nirayana and the Sayana zodiac, but the widely accepted date of coincidence, according to N.C. Lahiri, in India is A.D. 285. The 12 signs of the zodiac are highly occult divisions of the firmament, connected with many mythologies and esoteric teachings. Very strong supra physical, well differentiated esoteric impulses radiate through them, which vitally affect the universe, Earth, and life on this planet. Information about these impulses is given in religious scriptures in a garbled and veiled manner. Blavatsky states that the 12 signs of the zodiac are connected with the 12 sons of Jacob. Other scriptures also relate the zodiacal signs with mythological beings personifying powerful spiritual and supernatural forces. She even mentions that wherever the world religions mentioned the number 12, they mean the zodiacal signs. The following are the 12 signs of zodiac, with their presently believed basic significance: 1. Aries: Ram, Mesham. Action less but with potency for action. The primeval cause of material existence but the seed of causation has not fructified to become the tree of life. 2. Taurus: Bull, Vrishabham . The basic strife for creative union. Cosmic energy begins to flow at this stage: force as well as matter, both, are generated, which are necessary for causing action. 3. Gemini: Twins, Mithunam. Duality. In fact, a trinity representing Father, Mother and the Holy Ghost; three guans (q.v.), viz., Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, or harmony, activity and dissolution, respectively; Trimurti, comprising Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra, or creation, preservation and assimilation, respectively. It stands for Mahat, the cosmic intelligence."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY THROUGH THE NIRAYANA SYSTEM : REFERENCE TO HINDU VEDIC ASTROLOGY PART II Prof. Anthony Writer, Jyotisha Bharati, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai 3024.
