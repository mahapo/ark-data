If the 4th lord is in 4th and it happens to be its moolatrikona, the mother will live long 12.

If the 2nd and 11th lords are in 10th, free from afflictions, rajayoga results 3. Rahu’s placement in 4th, 5th, 10th or 11th gives a rajayoga during Rahu dasa 4. Ketu in the 5th or 9th is evil. In the 3rd, it’s capable of producing a rajayoga 5. The placement of Moon and Venus in 3rd is auspicious, during the Venus dasa 6. There’s no permanent yoga if the 10th lord is either in 3rd or 11th 7. When Jupiter lords the 10th, his placement in 3rd gives the same yoga as that when he’d have owned the 3rd 8. While the placement of the 9th lord in 8th is generally unfavorable, the same placement when Jupiter lords the 9th is very auspicious 9. When the 8th and 9th lords associate, the dasa of the former will confer fame and power 10. An association of the 10th and 11th lords confers a rajayoga during the 11th lord’s dasa, while bad results occur during the 10th lord’s periods and 11th lord’s bhuktis 11.

If the lords of 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and Jupiter are all together in a watery sign, the native will have dips in rivers as sacred as Ganga and in Ganga itself during Jupiter’s dasa 3. No pilgrimage will be undertaken by the native during the dasas of the 5th and 7th lords; he’ll spend his time listening to God’s stories in this time instead 4. If Jupiter and Saturn are in 9th in Aquarius, the native will have the fortune of many dips in the Ganga and holy rivers. The same results if there’s a Venus-Sun-Jupiter combine in 10th in Capricorn 5. If the 10th lord is associated with Jupiter, the native will be religious. Opposite results are produced when the 10th lord is in the 6th or 12th Chapter 11 Combinations for death 1. The 2nd lord becomes a maraka in the dasa of the 12th lord, and vice-versa 2. If the second lord associates with the 12th lord, the latter becomes a powerful maraka during the dasa of the 2nd lord 3. If the 12th lord aspects the 12th house, the planets in that house become marakas during the dasa of the 2nd lord 4. Death may take place in the bhuktis of malefics in the 12th within the 12th lord’s dasa 5.

Death can be predicted in the dasa of the 6th lord and bhukti of the 8th lord 10. Planets aspected by the 8th lord and planets associated with the 6th lord become marakas in the dasa of the 8th lord 11. Death will be caused in the dasa of a malefic in 8th and bhukti of the 6th lord 12. Death will be caused in the dasa of a malefic in 6th and bhukti of the 8th lord 13. Death will happen in the dasa of a malefic in 8th and bhukti of a malefic in the 6th 14. For Taurus lagna natives, if Mercury and Venus are in Virgo, they become mutual marakas 15. Mars inflicts death in his dasa if he has evil lordship and is placed in the 5th house 16. When Saturn associates with marakas in a chart, he becomes death-inflicting, even if he owns favorable houses 17. Death will be caused in the dasa of the 8th lord when he occupies the lagna 18. If two or more children of the native undergo Rahu dasa concurrently, the native dies in that time Chapter 12 Results of dasas 1. Unless born in Sagittarius and Pisces lagnas, when Venus and Saturn give rise to yogas in the other’s dasas, unfortunate results are to be expected in Saturn’s dasa Venus bhakti and Venus dasa Saturn bhukti 2.

If the 3rd and 10th lords are in association, the native will be bereft of fortune in the 10th lord’s dasa but enjoy good results in the 3rd lord’s dasa 4. The 5th, 7th and 9th being in their own houses facilitate dips in sacred rivers during their dasas and bhuktis 5. A person gets wealth by his own efforts in the dasa of planets occupying the lagna or 7th house. He’ll also acquire wealth during the 9th lord’s dasa if he occupies 7th 6.
