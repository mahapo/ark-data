The inspiration is Leelavati Ganitam, a chapter in the ancient mathematical treatise, the Siddhanta Siromani, written by Bhaskaracharya in 1150CE. The Leelavati Ganitam is fascinating not only for its treatment of indeterminate analysis and a method to solve Pell’s Equation, but also, as a Canadian university’s website on mathematical history puts it, for its poetic conversation between the narrator and a narratee named Leelavati1. The similarity between this poetic construct and the conversation between Apara Ganita and the dwara palika is probably noticeable. Frame stories are not common for scientific research papers, but they certainly have a historical precedent.   1 “Bhaskaracharya”, History of Mathematics, Simon Fraser University, <http://www.math.sfu.ca/histmath/India/12thCenturyAD/Bhaskara.html> (21st September, 2002.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 2 Prologue – The Mystical Garden of Enchanted Numbers Once upon a time, in the magical mystical city of Suvarnapuri2, there lived a student called Apara Ganita3. Apara Ganita was virtuous and devoted to his sciences. Having spent considerable amount of time learning the shastras from his guru, he was surprised when one day his guru called him up. “You have performed well, O sishya4 mine”, the guru said, “but the time has now come for you to take leave”. Apara Ganita was at once sad, for he had learned a lot under him. But he remained quiet and continued listening to his guru. “Listen, Apara Ganita, I shall now tell you something that my guru told me when I finished my studies. For, a study in Ganita Sastra (mathematics) is not complete, unless one visits the Mystical Garden of Enchanted Numbers” “You must go and find this place for your education to be truly complete”. And so Apara Ganita went about searching for this place. Indeed, after much travelling and searching, he was finally shown the way to the Mystical Garden of Enchanted Numbers. And lo, what a beautiful sight it was! For it was situated in the midst of a lush green valley, saddled by mountains on either side. Down there, Apara Ganita could see famous mathematicians expositing their theories and skills, like hawkers on a bazaar street. There was Euclid standing on a rectangle, explaining the beauty of the Golden Ratio in classic Greco Caldean architecture.

However, as he was about to enter through the great doors guarding the garden, he heard a sonorous voice calling out his name. He stopped and turned around to see who was calling him only to saw a young woman coming towards him.

It must be reiterated though, that such an exercise might be misleading. The classification is indeed not watertight; all calendars are intrinsically inter-linked with one another. A flowchart of the various Indian calendars and the links between them is given in the Appendix. With this caveat, we’ll now traverse India on a calendrical vehicle of sorts. In particular, we try to ascertain the following elements in each region’s calendrical practices: - Â Basis of the Calendar Â Local Variation. Â When does the year begin? Â Era Followed We’ll find the following calendars defined with these metrics: - The Southern Amaanta Calendar The Southern Amaanta Lunisolar Calendar is predominantly followed in the South and South-West Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. It is essentially a lunisolar one; i.e., its days and months are calculated based on the motions of the moon. Like the Chinese calendar, the month is calculated from new moon to new moon. It however, differs from the Chinese calendar in that the lunar day (“thithi”) of the new moon is considered the last day of the previous month. Again, as in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 6 the Chinese calendar, a leap month, an adhika maasa, is added to the calendar every 2.7 years on an average to offset the disparity in lengths between the lunar year and the sidereal year. In addition, a month, the kshaya maasa, is occasionally subtracted. This is discussed in a later segment. The Southern Amaanta Calendar differs from the Western Amaanta Calendar in its treatment of kshaya maasas, the New Year Day and the Era followed. We believe that the Southern Amaanta Calendar follows the Southern School for treating kshaya maasas. Saha and Lahiri suggest that it follows the Salivahana Saka Era starting with Chaitra Sukla Pratipada5, the lunar day after the last new moon before Mesha Sankranti. The years are also named according to the names of the Jovian years (Southern School6). The Eras and handling of kshaya maasas will be discussed in detail in their respective segments. Western Amaanta Calendar As already mentioned, we believe it's important to distinguish between the Amaanta calendar practised in South and West India. In West India, specifically, in the state of Gujarat, the Amaanta calendar is of two forms7, one that starts with Aashaadha (followed in the Kathiawar region) and one that starts with Kartika (followed all throughout Gujarat). Both calendars follow the Vikrama Era and both also possibly follow the North Western School for kshaya months.   5 Chakravarty, Apurba Kumar and SK Chatterjee “Indian Calendar from Post-Vedic Period to AD 1900” in History of Astronomy in India.

(Earlier literature fails to mention Uttaranchal, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Delhi, but they are off-shots of bigger states and would necessarily follow the same calendar). The last of the three Indian lunisolar calendars, this one differs from the Amaanta calendar in that the months are reckoned from full moon to full moon. Therefore, the Purnimaanta calendar starts two weeks before the Amaanta calendar does; that is, it starts with the lunar day after the last full-moon before Mesha Sankranti. The Vikrama Era is followed9, along with the Northern School of Jovian-year names10. The Malayali Calendar We now come to the list of Solar Calendars. The Malayali Calendar is predominantly followed in the South Indian state of Kerala. It is essentially a solar calendar; as we shall see later, the months are defined according to the raasis. The year starts with the Simha Sankranti and follows the Kollam Era.11 The month begins on the same day as a Sankranti if it occurs before aparahna, i.e., three-fifths of a day. Otherwise, it begins on the next day.   8 Chatterjee, SK.

This calendar is also solar; the month begins on the same day as a Sankranti if it occurs before sunset12. The Kali Era is followed along with the Southern Jovian cycle. One peculiarity about the Tamil calendar is that its month names start with Chittirai13 (Chaitra). Bengali Calendar The Bengali calendar is predominantly followed in West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. The Era is the Bengali San. The rule for the beginning of the month is again different; the month begins on the day after a Sankranti, if it occurs before midnight. Otherwise, it begins on the third day.14 Oriya Calendar The Oriya calendar is followed in the Eastern state of Orissa. In addition to the Bengali San, the Saka, Vilayati and Amli eras are followed.15 The month begins on the same day as that of the respective Sankranti.16 The Nanakshahi Calendar Promulgated in 1998 CE, the Nanakshahi Calendar is followed in Punjab. It’s intrinsically linked to the Gregorian calendar, except in its usage of the Nanakshahi Era.17   12 Chatterjee. p. 14 13 Ibid. p. 9 14 Ibid. p. 14 15 Saha et al. p. 258 16 Chatterjee. p.14 17 Pal Singh Purewal, Nanakshahi Samat < http://www.sikh.net/sikhism/Nanakshahi.htm > (22nd September, 2002)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 9 National Calendar of 1957 Proposed by the Calendar Reform Committee of 1952 and promulgated in 1957 CE, the National Calendar is a tropical calendar with fixed lengths of days and months.

Listening to this, she said, “Since we are deep in this game, Might I ask how each month got its name?” To which Apara Ganita stared at a gulmohar flower with twenty-seven buds and replied thus:- The complexity of the Indian calendar system is not just in the plethora of calendars available, but also in the manner in which they link up with one another. A principal point of linkage of most Indian calendars is in their names of the months; as we shall see, the similar sets of month names are used in more than one calendar. In this section, we aim to formulate rules determining the naming of the months. Our motivation is not just taxonomic; month names, we shall see, are critical to understanding the Indian calendar system. We propose that there are two types of month names: - 1) Months named after Nakshatras The set of month names named after nakshatras is used by both solar and lunisolar calendars, adding to seeming complexity of the Indian calendar system. Indeed, as we shall see, this type should actually called as ‘Months initially named after Nakshatras’; there has been an infusion of solar rules into an essentially lunar convention. Let us then, first consider the original rule. Saha and Lahiri mention that pakshas or fortnights were differentiated based on the nakshatra “where the moon is full”.20 That is to say, if a particular full moon occurs near, say, the lunar asterism, Visakha, the full moon would be called as Vaisakha Purnimaasi, and the month would be Vaisakha. The earliest lunisolar months, then, were purnimaanta, that is, the name of the full moon   20 Saha et al. p. 221"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 13 corresponded to the name of the month. Of course, the full moon occurs at all nakshatras. Fifteen were taken into account for naming of the month, spaced more or less equally. We thus have the following set of names along with their respective nakshatras21: - Nakshatra on Purnima Month Name Chitra  Chaitra  Visakha  Vaisakha  Jyestha  Jyaistha  (Purva & Uttara) Aashaadha Aashaadha Sravana  Sraavana  (Uttara & Purva) Bhaadrapada Bhaadrapada Asvini  Asvayuja  (Aasvina)  Krittika  Kaarthika  Mrugasira  Maarghasira  Pushyami  Pausa  (Pushyam)  Maghaa  Maagha  (Uttara and Purva) Phalguni Phalguna It may be noted that the months of Aashaadha, Bhadrapada and Phalguna are linked to two nakshatras respectively. Chatterjee and Chakravarthy give the following criteria for choosing nakshatras for month names22: - 1) The yogataaras or the identifying stars of the nakshatras are prominent or have traditional significance. 2) They are spaced more or less equidistant from one another. It must be mentioned that this rule is now an approximation largely due to Earth’s precession; for instance, this year’s Chitra Purnimaasi had Swati as its nakshatra. Also, possibly for historical reasons, and allowing for regional variation in pronunciation, the Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Punjabi and Tamil solar calendars also use the same set of month names. To reconcile all this, we might frame a new rule; that, the amaanta lunar   21Saha et al. p. 221 22 Chakravarthy et al, p. 281"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 14 month takes its number from the solar month that starts in it, but its name from the solar month in which it starts, while following the purnimaanta months in chronological order. That is to say, since Chitra occurred during the purnima of this year’s first purnimaanta month, we call this month as ‘Chaitra’. Consequently, the first amaanta month would also be ‘Chaitra’, which also would be the name of the solar month during which the amaanta ‘Chaitra’ started. However, the ‘number’ of the solar month (‘1’ in the case of amaanta and purnimaanta Chaitra) is not quite the same; the solar Chaitra is the last (i.e., 12th) month of the year. The lunisolar Chaitra’s number is taken by the solar month that begins in it, namely the solar Vaisakha. All this can be seen in the graphic in the next page. The relationships for all the months may be mapped according to the following table23: - Raasi Approximate nakshatra on Purnima Lunar Month Name Solar Month Name Assamese Version Tamil Version Punjabi Version24Mesha Chitra Chaitra Vaisakha Bahag Chittarai Vaisakh Vrshava Visakha Vaisakha Jyaistha Jeth Vaikasi Jeth Mithuna Jyestha Jaishta Aashaadha Ahar Aani Harh Karkata (Purva & Uttara) Aashaadha Aashaadha Sraavana Saon Aadi Sawan Simha Sravana Sraavana BhaadrapadaBhad Aavani Bhadon Kanya (Purva & Uttara) Bhaadrapada BhaadrapadaAsvayuja (Aasvina) Ahin Purattaasi Asu Tula Asvini Asvayuja (Aasvina) Kaarthika Kati Arppisi Katik Vrischika Krittika Kaarthika Maarghasira Aghon Karthigai Maghar Dhanus Mrugasira Maarghasira Pausa (Pushyam) Puha Maargali Poh Makara Pushyami Pausa (Pushyam) Maagha Magh Thaai Magh Kumbha Maagha Maagha Phalguna Phagun Maasi Phagun Mina (Uttara and Purva) Phalguna Chaitra Chait Panguni Chet   23 Chakravarthy, et al. p. 280 24 Pal Singh Purewal, Nanakshahi Samat. < http://www.sikh.net/sikhism/Nanakshahi.htm >"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 15 Phalguni The Assamese, Punjabi and Tamil versions have been provided to give an idea of the linguistic variation. It is also interesting to observe that the National Calendar suggested by Saha and Lahiri also uses the same set of month names, increasing the potential confusion. As is probably obvious by now, the rule does not correspond to the Tamil, National and Nanakshahi calendars. 2) Months named after raasis Only so lar mo nths share their names wit h raasis. SK Chatterjee and Apurba Kumar Chakravarthy give the following names along with the associated raasis25. Raasi Sanskritised Version Malayalam Version Mesha Mesha Medam Vrshava Vrshava Edavam Mithuna Mithuna Midhunam Karkata Karkata Karitaka Simha Simha Chingam Kanya Kanya Kanni Tula Tula Thulam Vrischika Vrischika Vrischikam Dhanus Dhanus Dhanu Makara Makara Makaram Kumbha Kumbha Kumbham Mina  Mina  Minam  That is to say, the month shares its name with that of its corresponding Sankranti. For instance, if Mesha Sankranti occurs on a certain day, then the period until the next Sankranti would be Mesha maasa (Medham maasam). This naming rule is followed primarily in the Malayalam calendar. Incidentally, Abhayankar says that the Oriya calendar also follows this rule.26   25 Chakravarty, et al. p. 280 26 Abhayankar, p. 55"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 16 Parva Dina Nirnaya – How the days of festivals are decided.

First, the terms. “Nisita” is defined to be a time-period measured by two ghatikas (1/60th of a solar day; approximately 20 minutes) stretching on either side of midnight. “Pradosha” is the time-period stretching for two muhurtas (1/15th of the time between sunrise and sunset; approximately 1 hour 36 minutes) after sunset. “Madhyahna” is one-third of the time-period between sunrise and sunset. This fraction covers mid-day. Second, these dates are valid only on non-intercalary thithis for all lunisolar festivals. Both leap days and non-leap days in leap months are deemed unfit for festivals. (Kshaya maasas are not an issue here because a) jugma months are deemed fit for religious observance and b) in the Eastern and Northwestern schools, the extra intercalary month is deemed to be normal). And finally, if the given thithi doesn’t cover the given time, or covers the given time on two solar days, then the second solar day is reckoned to be the respective festival.   28 Sivasri Sarma, Madugula.

Also, we do not attempt to link individual calendars to eras, for the same calendar may be reckoned with two different eras in two different places. Here’s the listing29: - Era Zero Year Beginning of Era with respect to individual year Saka 78 CE Mesha Sankranti, Chaitra S 1 Vikrama 57 CE Mesha Sankranti, Chaitra S 1, Kartika S 1, Ashadha S 1 Kali 3101 BCE Mesha Sankranti, Chaitra S 1 Kollam 824 CE Kanya Sankranti, Simha Sankranti Bengali San 963 + solar years since 1556 CE Mesha Sankranti In addition, some regions also name their years according to the names of the Jovian years. Saha and Lahiri point out that there are two schools for this; the Southern school names its years in continuous succession, while the Northern school names its years corresponding to the present Jovian year30.   29 Saha et al. p. 252 – 258. 30 Ibid. p 272"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 19 Kshaya Sutra – How certain months are dropped. Observing the reaction, she enquired, To calendars you seem to be an active saakshya31, But have you studied the ephemerally confounding kshaya? To which, Apara Ganita looked at some fallen leaves and replied thus:- One of the most interesting aspects of the Indian lunisolar calendar is its kshaya maasas, literally “decayed months”. Occasionally, certain months are dropped from the lunisolar calendar. We now try to understand the modalities behind this omission; we try to answer how, why, when and where it happens. First, let’s try to define a kshaya month. Chatterjee, in his work on Indian calendars, says that a certain lunar month “may completely overlap any of the short three nirayana solar months of Margasira, Pausha and Magha”, with the result that there will be no new moon in the respective solar month. Consequently, there will be no lunar month named “after ...this solar month”.32 A graphic describing this interaction is given in Appendix C. We learn the following from this statement: - a) that the solar months of Margasira, Pausa and Magha are small, b) that at a certain time, there might be no new moon in these months, and c) the corresponding lunar month is dropped from the calendar. Note that Chatterjee is silent on whether the dropped lunar month is amaanta or purnimaanta; a naïve assumption would be that since he talks about new moons, the month would be amaanta. But, a study of the (Chaitradi) amaanta and purnimaanta calendars for the present year reveals that the difference between these two calendars is still two weeks. Therefore, it’s safe to conclude that kshaya months were dropped from the purnimaanta calendar as well.   31 saakshya = witness (in Sanskrit) 32 Chatterjee, p. 34"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 20 Moreover, the statement about “corresponding lunar month” is unclear; are we talking about the lunar month with the same number as the new-moon-lacking solar month? Or are we talking about the lunar month with the same name o f the so lar month? Running the calendrica code provided by Dershowitz and Reingold with their book Calendrical Calculations – The Millenium Edition (see table for values), we see that it’s the lunar month with the same name that gets dropped. To account for a purnimaanta kshaya, and to further clarify which month to drop, we re-phrase the definition of a kshaya month to be thus: - “in any given lunar year, if two consecutive Sankrantis occur between two consecutive new moons, then the lunar month, whether amaanta or purnimaanta, with the same name as the solar month in which this occurs, is dropped.” As we shall see, such a re-phrasing is useful for computational purposes. Indeed, as we mentioned earlier, we ran the Dershowitz and Reingold’s calendrica package to get values for the occurrence of a kshaya month. Since searching for a kshaya month is computationally very heavy33, we used a table prepared by Saha and Lahiri (table 22 in the book)34 as a starting point. We also tabulated results for non-kshaya months, specifically years with gaps of 19, 46, 65, 76, 122 and 141 years respectively. The results and the graphs from these results are tabulated in the appendix. It must be noted that all cases tabulated previously have been calculated according to Surya Siddhantic rules and that we may get a different set of results if calculated according to ephemeris calculations. Indeed, as Chatterjee has pointed out, there was a difference in 1964 CE; ephemeris calculations showed Margasira to be kshaya (and   33 Dershowitz, Nachum and Reingold. Calendar Tabulations – 1900 to 2200.

What do we get from all this? We see that a kshaya month can occur every 19, 46, 65, 76, 122 or 141 years. Indeed, Saha and Lahiri’s tabulation provide us with the following frequencies of occurrences for gaps between kshaya months: - IntervalNumber of times occuring191146365176112211416 Table – Number of times a particular interval gap occurred We therefore see that between 525 CE and 1985 CE, kshaya occurred 11 times with a gap of 19 years, thrice with a gap of 46 years, six times with a gap of 141 years, and once each with gaps of 65, 76 and 122 years. The obvious question one would like to ask would be why. Why does kshaya occur only in these gaps? To answer this better, we re-iterate what causes kshaya in the first place. We already said that a kshaya would occur when two consecutive Sankrantis occur between two Amavasyas. That is to say, when a solar month is shorter in length than, and is completely enclosed by, a (an Amaanta) lunar month. Saha and Lahiri go on to say that the “maximum duration of a lunar month exceeds the lengths of the solar months only in   35 Chatterjee, SK. p. 38 36 Dershowitz, Nachum and Edward M. Reingold.

This would explain the solar month part, but what of lunar? How can the lunar month be bigger than the solar month? Ala’a Juwad has some answers; in his article, he suggests that the canonical synodic month, a lunar month between two consecutive phases of the moon, is not constant in length. Indeed, he goes on to say that between 1600 and 2400 CE, the synodic month extends in length from 29 days 6 hours and 31 minutes to 29 days 19 hours and 59 minutes.38 Moreover, he says that the “longest lunar months ... occur when the date of the new Moon coincides with apogee”.39 A brute-force search for the longest synodic month definitely won’t give us a kshaya; for kshaya to occur, the lunar month needs to be only bigger than its solar counterpart and more importantly, completely encompass it. Indeed, Jawad says that the longest synodic month occurred in 1610 CE, a year which occurs within the 141 year long kshaya hiatus between 1540-1541 CE and 1680 – 81 CE. We therefore search for other clues to unscramble kshaya. On a purely arithmetic perspective, we observe the following: - 19 = 19 * 1 46 = 19 * 2 + 8 65 = 19 * 3 + 8 76 = 19 * 4 122 = 19 * 6 + 8 141 = 19 * 7 + 8 That is to say, the year-gaps are in the form 0, 8 mod 19.   37 Saha et al. p. 250 38 Jawad, Ala’a. “How Long Is a Lunar Month?” in Sky & Telescope, November 1993. p. 76 39 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 23 Is it possible then, that the kshaya month has something to do with the Metonic cycle? The Metonic Cycle is a fairly well documented phenomenon; first observed by the Greek astronomer Metos, every 19 years, the lunar dates overlap with the tropical ones. The underlying mathematical reason is simple: - 19 sidereal years contain 19*365.242189 = 6939.6 solar days, while 235 synodic months (with a mean of 29.53 solar days) contain 235*29.530588853 = 6939.68 solar days. The lengths overlap. But this obviously is neither necessary nor sufficient; it might be useful for the dates to repeat, but it definitely doesn’t fulfil the requirement for kshaya. One suggestion therefore, might be that the kshaya occurs when the number of solar days of a sidereal year is equal to that of a synodic month, which in turn is equal to that from an anomalistic month. An anomalistic month is defined to be the time – period between two consecutive perigee passages and has a mean value of 27.55455 days. Taking these average values, we calculate the average values of solar days in whole numbers of synodic and anomalistic months (canonical kshaya years shaded for reference): - IntervalOccurrence ModuloSolar YearSynodic MonthsAnomalistic Months1911 1*196939.6015916939.688386943.7466270 1*19+89861.5391039863.2166779864.5289380 2*1913879.2031813879.3767613887.4932463 2*19+816801.1406916802.9050616808.2755570 3*1920818.8047720819.0651420831.2398651 3*19+823740.7422923742.5934423752.0221761 4*1927758.4063627758.7535227774.9864840 4*19+830680.3438830682.2818230695.7687950 5*1934698.0079634698.441934718.7331030 5*19+837619.9454737621.970237639.51531140 6*1941637.6095541638.1302841634.925051221 6*19+844559.5470644561.6585844555.707351330 7*1948577.2111448577.8186648578.671651416 7*19+851499.1486551501.3469651499.45395 Broadly speaking, we might summarize the above table as thus: - for the most part, the number of solar days in solar years, synodic and anomalistic months overlap in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 24 kshaya years. However, this overlap doesn’t occur only in kshaya years; as the table shows, there’s an overlap for 133 years as well. Does this, then, explain the kshaya phenomenon? We might summarize it as being strongly suggestive, but definitely not conclusive. Treatment of Kshaya Months40 We may complete our discussion of kshaya months by describing the three Kshaya Schools of thought. The North Western School is followed in the north-western part of the country, presumably in Gujarat and/ or Rajasthan, where the lunisolar calendar is used. Essentially, the North Western School treats the adhika month before kshaya as a normal month and the one after the kshaya month to be intercalary. This contrasts with the Eastern School where the reverse is followed; the adhika month before the kshaya is deemed intercalary, while the one after it is deemed normal. The Eastern School is followed in the eastern parts of the country, where the lunisolar calendar is followed. The final of the trio, the Southern School, treats both adhika maasas as intercalary, instead reckoning the kshaya month as a “jugma”, i.e., the first half of the thithi of this month is deemed to be that of the first month, and the second half as that of the second month. This is presumably followed in the Southern parts of the country where the lunisolar calendar is followed.   40 Chatterjee, SK. p 37- 40"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Panchanga- Tantra: The Magic of the Indian Calendar System / 25 Epilogue – The Beginning By this time, onlookers all sides gathered around the two.
