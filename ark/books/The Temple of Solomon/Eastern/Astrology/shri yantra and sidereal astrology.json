Like a tree the human transmutes elementsfrom the Earth and the Sun into growth. Like a tree, thegrowing end or tip is vital to the whole well—being of theorganism. Hormonal activity is regulated by the growingshoot, and if each branch grows then the whole tree ben-efits.Everything in nature is based on a similar model. Thusthe branches of the Cosmos are Solar Systems with lateralshoots such as the nine planets and buds — the variousMoons.In our life on Earth these principles are paramount.The Moon in our being is responsible for all growth, for theregulation of our bodies, and the rythmns to which werespond quite mechanically.The seed of life itself is found in the Sun, the well-spring or Light, so to say, which burns from within itself.Fruit of growth can only occur when the conditions areright. That is, every individual’s well-being depends on each"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"branch and its true development and growth. Upon thisfactor depend the correct hormonal vibrations reaching thebloodstream. All of this depends on the environment con-taining sufficient substances for metabolism, and on theinteraction of the being with such substances.Consciousness is the greatest fruit of the growthprocess — the sixteenth digit which contains the possibili-ties of all possibilities. If we follow Nature then this growthcan be encouraged and also stimulated. But, as in plantmanagement, all must be done just right. For there is noguarantee of growth, only its possibility.This analogy between plant and human life has beenmaintained at such length because of the very close simi-larities between the two processes. While a fruit-bearingtree represents a stage in our cosmic ladder, we ourselvesmay represent the growing end of our planet Earth. Thisgives the possibility of regeneration of Earth by the dev-elopment of Consciousness.In Shri Vidya the processes of human life are seen tobe based on the activity of the Moon. As all organic proc-esses partake of similar laws and forces, the differentphases of the Moon can guide us in our investigations intoall laws and processes.Personified as the 15 Nityas (Eternities), the differentparts of the Moon represent what can grow in us. Sustainedas we are by the vitality of the Sun, and with our bodiesrepresenting the earthy component, our own Moon repre-sents the regulatory factor. The Tantrikas describe a su-preme or Mahanitya who represents the fruit of the devel-opment of the 15 branches.Some of the qualities of a Being in whom theMahanitya is apparent are described in one of the tantras orsacred works: “Free from doubts in spite of conflictingscripture, full of contentment as he has realized himself,and with a feeling of his completeness. Always merciful and- free from both hatred and attachment. Honest and hum-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ble. Grateful. His concern is truth and not the affairs ofothers. He seeks not wealth. His attachment to anythingoutside himself is only to the extent necessary for hisbody’s preservation.” (Tantrarajatantra)Unfortunately there are few human beings like thisaround. The reasons for this are to be found in man’sonesided growth.Men and women, because of intrinsic factors presentfrom birth develop one-sidedly, along one line only, so tospeak, and consequently other branches of the same treemay become stunted, or, at best, only partially developed.With this degree of identification the supreme fruit is im-possible.Faculties which every man and every woman possessas birthrights consequently decay and fall into disrepair.What literally happens is that because of constitutional andtime-conditioned factors, only one or a few branches de-velop in a being.The regulation of the hormones releasedby each individual’s Moon depends on a correct relationshipbetween each part of the organism. Overemphasis on onebranch creates beings who manifest various ‘poisons’. It isthese which cause the being misery.Such chemical messengers are formed in us throughthe influence of the Moon, and the description of -deitiesfound in the literature of Shri Vidya describe very preciselyand completely their nature and function.Regulation of our being by the Moon is through themedium of 15 parts, eight of which correspond to the eightplanets apart,from Earth, three of which are the humancorollaries of Sun, Moon and Earth, and four of whichrepresent the so-called ‘four elements’.The presiding Devi (Goddess) of the circle of ShriVidya is She called Maha-Tripura-Sundari (TranscendentBeautiful Triple City). This Triple City is the being of everyMan and every Woman, and consists of three Shaktis orEnergies which correspond to the Sun, the Moon and Earth."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The only way of all-spreading growth is for these energiesto come together.This gives the possibility of working with the 15 ener-gies which can be growing parts of our being. And, funda-mentally, this is what schools of Shri Vidya do. By cultivat-ing Consciousness of the 3 Energies and by stimulatinggrowth in one direction and pruning in another, the hormo-nal messengers of the Supreme Energy can be gently madeto yield their fruit.Because it is easy to recognize which ends are growingtoo much (and consequently affecting the Being adversely)this task is not so difficult as may at first appear.Furthermore, because of the laws of our Cosmos, it ispossible to precisely determine which condition prevails inwhich individual. This is where the Guru comes in — in ourtime span the Circle Itself.The complex symbology of the Nityas in such books asiNityashodashika or Tantrarajatantras is designed to revealsuch precise knowledge. For example the 15 form a circle.Each Goddess has a number of arms, the total of which inthe whole circle is 108. The importance of this number is inits determination of the branch or type which each unre-generate human being represents. Such a person is, as itwere, the growing end of their own partial identification.It is the primary aim of Shri Vidya to enable the indi-vidual to realize his or her Triple Being with all its branches,faculties and functions. Being founded upon real considera-tions such schools that today function have little time forpeople without the necessary potential to benefit.By knowing oneself, that is by knowing one’s place inthe Universe and the possible branches of individual evolu-tion the Sun of the heart can warm the body and light thepersonality. All human growth follows the pattern of thelunar phases, and, until conditioning and lies interfere withnatural growth at some arbitrary period of a child’s life, theprocess continues. Its progress is most apparent in the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"period from conception to the age of seven — a periodwhich represents in its entirety all 15 phases.It is during this formatory and important cycle that thechild develops faculties typical of a human being; thebranches, so to speak, emerge from the main trunk. It isapparent that forces at birth play a very important part inthis development. There are in all 27 aspects (yogas) whichtend towards creating in a human being a bias towards oneor another phase or faculty. These 27 influences are inastrological usage referred to as aspects between the Sun,the Moon, the Angles and the eight planets. These 27yogas show which branch (or planet) receives, as it were,an extra impetus from, the three Lights of Sun, Moon, andEarth. An aspect in the Sidereal Chakra of one or more ofthese 27 yogas determines the orientation of the being ofthe individual and the direction in which he or she will growif such influence. is unchecked.The Moon acts with its phases as the mirror of theCosmos — all the elements of which are found within Man’sBeing — and acts, as it were, to regulate these differentfunctions for Her own use. The different functions possessa natural correlation with the phases of the Moon. The 27yogas form the disc of the Moon Four planets cohere in thewaning and four in the waxing in the anticlockwise orderPluto, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Uranus,Neptune andMars. It is this direction in which the child develops.

If examined, the planetscohere together into four pairs circling the Sun — thecentre of their system — at more or less similar frequency.These planetary branches of Sol have their corollariesin our being,held together in the order of the Moon’sphases.In turn these kalas or planets form the Solar or Lunarcomponent of four centres in Men and Women: Air, Earth,Water and Fire in that order (fig.ii). The fifth centre ofAether has the Sun and the Moon as pairs of ‘opposites’.The different centres all vibrate at their own rate,formed by the kalas or vibrations which make up the cen-tre.Cyril Fagan, the pioneer of Sidereal Astrology, laid thefoundations for present work on the kalas (although uncon-scious of their significance).He discovered for the West the import of the conjunc-tion, opposition and square and the great significance ofthe Navamsha (pronounced Naoansha and meaning ‘nineparts’) Chakra. These factors have been part of’ Shri Vidyafor aeons.It has previously been shown that the 27 yogas ofimportance in the Sidereal Chakra are directly referrable tothe Moon’s waxing and waning. So too the Sidereal Chakra,with its 360 also represents the Moon’s digits.The Navamsha Chart is obtained from the Siderealthrough the multiplication of the zodiacal longitudes in thelatter by nine. Thus in each Sidereal Constellation there arenine parts (Nava + Amsha) and in the whole zodiac 108parts.It should be noted by the practitioner of the art ofbeing human that the number 108 is of incalculable impor-tance in Shri Vidya. The connection with the 27 yogas isobvious, but the Yantra itself is based on these permuta-tions. Thus we have 16 yogas in the Navamsha Chakra and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"in the Rashi or Birth Chart the same 16 plus 10 more com-binations with the angles:Ravi27 yogasNavamsha16 yogas=43 triangles of the yantra.Aspects are drawn from both Chakras, the maximumpermissible orb for the three appropriate kinds of yogabeing 7°30'. Of the eight planets Pluto, Saturn, Uranus andNeptune are Lunar while the others are Solar. They find aplace in the human body: Pluto at the top of the head,Mercury at the brow, Jupiter at the tongue, Saturn in thethroat, Sun-Moon in heart and guts, Venus-Uranus at theanus, and Mars-Neptune at the genitals. These positionsare described in the’Heart of the Yogini’Tantra.The only practical way to discern the differing charac-teristics of people identifying with these partial kalas isthrough observation. With this method is possible to govery far. By seeing the effect of planetary identification inanother which one also knows is observable in one’s ownRashi and Navamsha. By using this method, self-knowledgeincreases, and so also does the possibility of the branchesflowering.Astrology without initiated interpretation assumes thatpeople’s natures are fixed, i.e. that people are their partialidentifications. The Nu Aeon dissolves such partiality.It is evident from what has been said here that eachbranch must be given the chance to grow for the wholetree to flourish and survive. The major characteristic of‘astrology’ in the hands of those without a conception ofthe True Will is the enslavement of people by assigning tothem fixed and mechanical functions. This Nu astrology isdesigned for the removal of partial and damaging identifica-tion.Breath is the essence of Time. The human being in afull day breathes 10800 times and in a night 10800 times.This means that each exhalation and inhalation lasts four"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"seconds. But the first breath of a baby establishes whichtime-scale the individual will pulse on. And if planetaryinfluences are present (as they always are) then the breathassumes the appropriate planetary scale.Only when breath is restored to its true rythmn, inaccord with the Sun and the Moon, does the individualreceive the necessary pranas.The removal of identification with any aspect of theCosmos, with any Shakti or Time-Function reveals the Blissof the Void. And, as we have within us the planets, theMoon, the Sun and the stars identification can cease onlywhen we have gone far beyond planetary identification, andrealised that Nuit which alone remains.AspectsAspects to be considered in the natal chart (called Rashi byHindu astrologers) are conjunctions, oppositions, squares ofSun and Moon with the eight planets, and conjunctions ofSun,Moon, or eight planets with any of the four angles.In the Navamsha chart the aspects to be consideredare only those between Sun, Moon and the eight planets.Orb for all aspects in either Rashi or Navamsha is 7°30'. Itshould be noted that the birthtime is most important in thissystem, and should be taken as the first breath of theindividual. (See Table for conversion of natal to navamshalongitudes)Strength of PlanetsAn aspect in either Rashi or Navamsha gives a planet 30units of strength. Further units may be given as follows, butonly apply when the planet is already aspected.i)If a planet is exalted or in the centre (15°) of itsown sign add 60 units.ii)If a planet is retrograde add 30 units.iii)Applying aspects add 30 points*iv)Exact aspects (within 1°) add 30 points"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"*This should be taken into consideration only if thetotal of points between one planet and another is equal.

Together these constitute the 27fundamental parts — the foundation of number.In the Sidereal Chakra the influence of the 12 Constel-lations commencing from 0 Taurus are represented bythese 12 parts. The influence of Sun, Planets, Earth and theMoon are represented by the 15 parts.

At the centre of the famous Yantra is thebindu ‘about to create’. This ‘Cave of the Heart’ is beyondthe 12 Constellations and the 15 digits. Itself triple, thebindu is described in the tantra called Outspreading of theDesire Ray (Kamakalavilasa). While the red bindu is the eggof mother and the white bindu the sperm of the father, themixed (Misra) bindu is the child or third element. At thecentre of these three bindus — from which emanates thewhole Cosmos -is Consciousness–Being–Bliss, the Void. Thered and the white bindu are, respectively, Mars in the natusof mother and father.In the horoscope of the child, theMars of the father becomes the Sun (Rashi & Navamsha)in either Fixed, Moveable or Common Signs.
