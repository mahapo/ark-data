"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Surya “Lotus seated, lotus in hand, brilliant as a lotus flower and sitting in a seven horse drawn chariot with two arms is the Sun.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction xiii Introduction This text, Graha Sutras, is largely a commentary on the Sutras on the planets from Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, “Parashara’s Monumental Astrological Scientific Text,” is quite a mysterious text. First, it is written as a recorded dialogue between the Rishi Parashara and his disciple Maitreya. Parashara was the father of Vyasa, Vyasa being the esteemed composer of the Mahabharata, Srimad Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita, in addition to which he is credited with having compiled and scribed the Vedas. And Parashara was his father. Maitreya was himself an exalted Rishi and is referred to throughout the text as Twice Born, Wise and other such names exemplifying his spiritual status. Being a dialogue between two such great souls, the brilliance of Parashara’s astrological text comes as no surprise. The question and the mystery, however, is whether Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra is actually a work of Parashara. The origins of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are controversial. Sanskrit scholars are of the opinion that it is a relatively modern text, post 600 AD, which is actually a compilation of texts that had come before it and that it is written in the colorful style of the dialogue between Parashara and Maitreya, though no such dialogue actually took place. Scholars hold this view on account of the fact that the Sanskrit style in which it is written is not that of age of the Mahabharata. Additionally, there is certainly evidence of compilation in the version available to us at this time, which will be discussed shortly. Most Astrologers, however, are inclined to believe, with religious fervor, that Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra is from the time of the Mahabharata, for in the text Parashara makes mention of a planetary combination that the current emperor, Yudhishthira, the emperor at the time of the Mahabharata, supposedly possessed."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv Graha Sutras In my opinion, the truth in this matter most likely lies somewhere in the middle. In order to explain this I must first explain what techniques Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra consists of and the nature of the currently available version of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. The greatest astrological scholar and writer in the 10th century was Bhattotpala. Bhattotpala made extensive commentaries of the important astrological texts of his time, wrote his own texts and was certainly the most learned astrologer of his day. In his commentaries he wrote that though he had heard of the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, he had never seen it. Thus we know it was lost for at least nine hundred years. The available version of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra was compiled and rewritten in the 19th century by a scholar who visited many Pundits in an attempt to scrape the text together, for it had been lost for at least nine hundred years. On account of it having been recompiled and rewritten, we have to approach the text with a careful eye for it is quite likely that mistakes have crept in and that parts may have been added which do not actually belong. The available version of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra consists of seven distinct major parts: 1. Descriptions of Grahas, Rasis, Bhavas and Vargas (the basics). 2. Mathematically precise techniques such as Shad Bala, Vimshopaka, Subha and Asubha Phala, and Ishta and Kashta, which are used along with five Avasthas to make predictions through Nakshatra Dasas. 3. Rasi-based techniques and Dasas that are similar to those which are found in Jaimini’s Upadesa Sutras. 4. Yogas. 5. Ashtakavarga. 6. Propitiations and remedies for inauspicious births. 7. Determining character from one’s body parts."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction xv Of the first mentioned portion, that of the descriptions of Grahas, Rasis, Bhavas and Vargas, the descriptions found in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are more complete as well as more accurate than those found in any other available astrological text. This is especially true in the context of Vargas. This inclines me to believe that these parts are attributable to Parashara. The mathematically precise techniques are unique to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, as are the inclusion of all five important Avasthas. These combined with Nakshatra Dasas and the directions given throughout the text provide a perfect system of predictive astrology. This system, in my opinion, can only be from Parashara, as it dwarfs all other techniques found in any of the other classical texts such as Brihat Jataka, Jataka Parijata, Phaladeepika, etc, which at best only hint at the techniques without providing any methodological or scientifically replicable techniques. After working with the techniques provided in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, as well as the techniques provided in other texts and by other astrologers, it is my tested opinion that these techniques are the backbone of true Parashara style astrology. (This text, Graha Sutras, is the first in a long line up of texts that will instruct in these methods, beginning with the fundamentals.) The Rasi-based techniques such as Upapada, Pada, Chara Karakas, etc. and the Rasi Dasas, which are similar to those found in Jaimini’s Upadesa Sutras, cannot be part of the original Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, or else they are so corrupt as to be useless. My reason for stating this is that they are all too often at variance with what is given in Upadesa Sutras or miss an important point that is provided in Upadesa Sutras with the result that the techniques as given in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra simply do not work effectively whereas the precise methods in Upadesa Sutras do. These parts in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are better ignored. If one wishes to learn the Rasi based Jaimini techniques they must turn their attention to Upadesa Sutras, a proper and useful translation of which is as of yet unavailable."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi Graha Sutras Many of the Yogas found in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are commonly found in other astrological texts, except for the unique 144 Bhava Yogas – the effects of each Bhava lord in each Bhava, which are not a common mark of other texts. It is quite likely that these 144 Bhava Yogas are attributed to Parashara as his system deals extensively with this aspect of astrology. With regards to the other Yogas it is difficult to ascertain. Were they taken from an older version of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra by the authors of other ancient texts or were they accidentally included in the available version of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra? The Nabhasa Yogas and the important named Yogas such as Gajakesari Yoga are clear and work in practice, so we can apply them with confidence even without knowing to whom they are attributable. The Raja Yogas given in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are, to a large degree, corruptions of that which is given in Upadesa Sutras, so it is better to turn to Upadesa Sutras for those. In conclusion, while some of the Yogas (outside the 144 Bhava Yogas) may be original to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, they are not unique to it and are found in many other texts as well. The 144 Bhava Yogas, however, are unique to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and thus a very important contribution. More must be said in the context of the 144 Bhava Yogas given by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra as they are very unique in the astrological literature. Other texts give the effects of planets in signs and planets in houses – these effects are hit and miss since they do not evaluate the planet in question. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra does not attempt such a foolish thing; rather it gives perfect mathematical techniques and Avasthas which allow the astrologer to determine with exactness the effects of a planet in a sign or in a house. Additionally it gives the effects of each house lord in each house – the 144 Bhava Yogas. These Yogas are important in the context of the larger predictive method presented by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and thus must be unique and original to the work."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction xvii Ashtakavarga, an involved system of transit effects, is found in many, many other texts over the past two millennia and as such we can no more be sure if these are unique to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra or not. The propitiations of the Grahas and remedies from inauspicious births are not a normal feature of astrological texts and may be attributable to Parashara, or they may only be appendages of what is common knowledge to the Indian priest. They are, however, of use and certainly unique to astrological texts. Chapters on determining characteristics from an individual’s body are not unique to astrological texts with many texts devoting time to this very useful subject. Whether it is original to Parashara or not there is no way of ascertaining. In conclusion, what does appear unique to Parashara and what is certainly the most important part if not the gist of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are its descriptions of the Grahas, Rasis, Bhavas and Vargas and the mathematically precise predictive techniques of Shad Bala, Vimshopaka, Ishta and Kashta, and Subha and Asubha Phala and the five groups of Avasthas: Baladi Avasthas, Jagradadi Avasthas, Lajittadi Avasthas and Shayanadi Avasthas. These together with the Nakshatra Dasas given in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are a perfect system for predicting events. This text, Graha Sutras, is the first of many exploring these most important parts of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. Now that you have the background of the great Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra of which I have translated portions for this text, I can proceed to tell you a bit about the purpose of this text. There are many, many ways in which the Grahas are put to use. No matter what techniques an astrologer may use the Grahas for, all the techniques have one thing in common – they all require an understanding of the Grahas. The purpose of this text is to provide that understanding so that when you do learn the astrological techniques, you will be able to derive the full value from the techniques. Furthermore, to proceed with a scientific system of predictive astrology the fundamental astrological components and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xviii Graha Sutras principles that are used in everything and all things astrological must be clearly understood. There can be no errors in the understanding of these principles or any derivation from the principles as given by the ancient Rishis, or else the divine science of astrology will cease to be scientific. All too often the available translations, as well as the modern books and teachings which are based on the available translations, are laced with such inaccuracies, which are a result of poor translation and translations being done by those who are not knowledgeable in the context of the Sutras being translated and so there are bound to be some errors. Over the past several years, as my Sanskrit studies have progressed, I have become more and more aware of these types of errors, many of which I had propagated myself in my earlier books which were based on the available and inaccurate translations and teachings. So in hopes in remedying that and in providing a solid foundation for your and other’s studies I present this text. This text is largely a commentary of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra’s Sutras on the Grahas. The translation will often be found to be slightly different than what is in the available translations as I have striven to give a more precise and literal and, as mentioned, more accurate translation than most. Where my translations differ on significant points I have explained my reasoning as to the correctness of my translation. In addition to the Sutras provided by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, I have found it worthwhile to add a few Sutras from other important texts such as Jataka Parijata and Yavana Jataka. Lastly I have included two chapters entirely my own: one on Grahas and numbers and the other on the myths surrounding the Grahas. My intention is thus to present an entirely complete manual for the study of the Grahas, after which you will only be in need of deepening your contemplations on this vast subject.

Grahas are, however, much more significant entities than mere tools of destiny. The true import of the Grahas is given in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Avtara{ynekain ýjSy prmaTmn>, jIvana< kmR)ldae ¢hêpI jnadRn> . 3. avatäräëyänekäni hyajasya paramätmanaù, jévänäà karmaphalado graharüpé janärdanaù. “The Supreme Unborn Spirit has had many descents. Janardana, in the form of the Grahas, rewards the fruits of the Karma of the Living Beings.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Narration of Avatars, 3 In this Sutra, Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra tells us that the Grahas are nothing but aspects of God and that the purpose of these Aspects of God is to bestow the results of Man’s, and other creatures, actions. The term used to signify God in His taking the form of the Grahas is Janardana – the one who agitates Man, causing fear and worry. No doubt, ill-disposed Grahas give us much to fear and worry, however, we should remember that the Grahas themselves are aspects of God and thus we should not fear them irrationally any more than we should fear God. Nor should we fear that which they bestow any more than we should fear that which God bestows upon us. Yet, since the fruits of our actions are often undesirable, we may often find ourselves fearing Janardana and the Grahas, so the next Sutra tells us the benefit of the Grahas so that"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Graha Sutras we may understand that they are here to help us and that indeed we have no need of fear. dETyana< blnazay devana< blv&Ïye, xmRs<SwapnawaRy ¢haJjata> zuÉa> ³mat! . 4. daityänäà balanäçäya devänäà balavåddhaye, dharmasaàsthäpanärthäya grahäjjätäù çubhäù kramät. “Destroying the strength of the Daityas, increasing the strength of the Devas, aiming to establish Dharma, the Auspicious Births proceed regularly from the Grahas.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Narration of Avatars, 4 Hindu religion and mythology holds that God occasionally incarnates on Earth in order to help mankind. These are the auspicious births mentioned in the Sutra. These incarnations of God are known as Avataras. The Avataras come to Earth to establish Dharma (which is living righteously and living in accord with one’s God-given innate nature), destroy the Daityas who are the demonic forces, and to strengthen the Devas who are the divine forces. There is a lot to learn from the fact that the birth of these divine incarnations that come to help mankind proceed from the Grahas. If these divine incarnations come from the Grahas and have their goal to establish righteousness, destroy the demonic forces and to strengthen the divine forces, then that must also be the very goal of the Grahas themselves. So the Grahas are not here to punish us and make our lives miserable or to reward us and make our lives pleasant and easy, rather, they bestow the fruits of our actions so that we will refrain from performing ill, so that we will indulge in doing that which is beneficial and so that we will become individuals secure in our innate nature and that we will follow the righteous path that our innate nature dictates.

Those with Para Atma as the larger portion are all known as heavenly. Those with Jiva as the larger portion are known as the living beings. The Para Atma portion has gone forth from the Grahas, the Sun, etc. and given birth to Rama, Krishna, and all Avataras. Then they are absorbed at their end after concluding their purifying business. The Jiva portion goes forth and is born as humans, etc. Similarly, these also then melt at their end into the imperceptible. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Narration of Avatars, 5-10 Here Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra tells us the names of the more important Avataras of the Hindu religion that have proceeded forth from each of the Grahas. These will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. All others are also considered to be brought forth from the Grahas. This means you and me as well as all divine incarnations and all other creatures. All births have Para Atma nature, which is the nature of the Supreme Spirit, and Jiva, which is the nature of the living beings such as dwell on Earth. If the Para Atma portion is the larger portion of a birth, then that birth is the birth of a holy personage such as the nine mentioned Avataras as well as those such as Christ or Mohammed. If the Jiva portion is larger, the birth is of some other earthly creature. So there is a difference between births, a difference in the amount of Supreme"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Grahas 23 Spirit and the amount of the nature of an earthly creature. It is because of this difference that the followers of the holy personages are never able to completely emulate the actions of the holy personage whom they adore or to completely understand their teachings, unless they themselves have a larger portion of Para Atma. However, by adoring himself or herself to a holy personage whom their innate nature draws them towards, the Jiva portion is slowly but surely replaced with more and more Para Atma. There is an important similarity between all births, whether that of holy personages or other simple earthly creatures – they are brought forth by the Grahas and upon their physical demise they are reabsorbed back through the Grahas. For this reason the Grahas can be looked upon as distant parents who provide for our existence, instruct us to behave and to better ourselves, and though they may do this harshly at times, we should adore or at least appreciate them as the helpful parents that they are. sUyaRdyae ¢ha> sveR äükamiÖ;ady>, @te caNye c bhv> prmaTma<zkaixka>. 23. sürädayo grahäù sarve brahmakämadviñädayaù, ete cänye ca bahavaù paramätmäàçakädhikäù. “All the Grahas the Sun, etc. Brahma, Siva, etc. these and others are more Para Atma abundant.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Narrating the Succession of the Created, 23 The Grahas are endowed with Para Atma consciousness, for if they were not how could they give birth to the many divine incarnations? The Grahas, being direct manifestations of Vishnu, could have no less than Para Atma consciousness. The Grahas are thus not simple lumps of dirt, minerals and gases, but divine entities that have an important role in all of our lives.

As a student of astrology it is well worth studying the lives of these Avataras as they shed some important light upon the nature of the Grahas. The lives of these Avataras are portrayed in the Srimad Bhagavatam, the reading of which is highly recommended as it provides spiritual, philosophical, psychological and even astronomical insights. For now, I will briefly describe the Avataras associated with the Grahas as there is much to be learned from the Avataras about the Grahas. Rama “Dark” – Avatara of the Sun Long ago during the Treta Yuga (the second highest age) there was an Asura (titan) king by the name of Ravana who was displaying great selfishness and arrogance, and who was fast breaking every code of Dharma. Ravana, though arrogant, had won many boons due to the strict penance he had performed. These boons made him so powerful that no one could conquer him or end his display of unrighteousness and so Adharma (unrighteousness) was becoming rampant in the world. Brahma and the Devas (the gods) went to the all-pervading Vishnu to request his assistance in riding the world of Ravana. Vishnu promised to incarnate as a lord in the Solar Dynasty and put an end to Ravana and his unrighteous rule. Vishnu was thus born as Rama, who exemplified all of the ideals of Dharma throughout the entirety of his life. Rama was of royal birth and was the crown prince of Ayodhya, however, through the scheming of one of his father’s wives the throne was unjustly taken from him and he was exiled to the forest for fourteen years. To insure that his father’s good name would remain unblemished,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 Graha Sutras Rama willingly accepted the exile with even-minded calmness and detachment, even though his father had already died due to the grief caused by Rama's exile. Rama's wife, Sita, and his brother, Lakshman would not part from Rama and followed him to the forest. Many adventures befell Rama during his exile and not even once did he stir from the strict path of Dharma. After many years of living and wandering in the forest, news of Sita’s beauty reached the ears of the titan Ravana, who then abducted Sita, hoping to make her his wife. Rama was heartbroken and made every effort to find Sita and rescue her from Ravana. After much time and effort, Rama destroyed Ravana, and Sita was returned to him. At that point the purpose of Rama's incarnation had been fulfilled; he had destroyed Ravana and exemplified Dharma. The trials of Dharma, however, are hard and Rama, after conquering Ravana, still had one more ideal to establish. After returning to his native city and becoming crowned, Rama heard that one of his subjects spoke ill of his wife. His subject declared that once a woman resides under the care of another man she should not be allowed to return to her husband, though Rama might accept her because he was infatuated with her, he would never accept her. That Sita was taken against her will, that she remained outside Ravana’s palace, only eating roots and fruits so as to eat what her husband Rama was eating in the forest while she waited for him to rescue her was not considered by this critic. Rama, feeling that as king his highest duty was to please his subjects, abandoned Sita to the ashram of Rishi Valmiki. Sita was pregnant at the time and after giving birth to Rama's twin sons she died. At hearing of Sita's death Rama was sunk in sorrow, but he remembered that a king has no right to have feelings of his own so he concentrated on ruling the earth until his death. Rama’s life was marked by sacrifice – the sacrifice of his kingdom, which once regained led to the sacrifice of his beloved. It is the Sun that provides the strength to make the hard sacrifices in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 27 life. The Sun also demands personal sacrifices for the sake of duty, the well-being of others, and for one’s spiritual development. If the Sun is strong and well disposed in the horoscope, an individual will have the ability to make the necessary sacrifices. Rama means “dark,” and lord Rama was named this on account of having a dark cast to his skin. While the Sun is not, of course, dark, those people and races living on Earth that are exposed to the Sun darken. Krishna “Dark” – Avatara of the Moon Krishna is the most beloved Avatar of the Hindus. The stories of Krishna are many and his devotees never tire of hearing them. Krishna was born of two saintly parents while imprisoned by Krishna’s uncle, the evil King Kamsa. Kamsa had imprisoned Krishna's parents because a voice from the sky had told him that their eighth child would be the death of him. Kamsa first killed Krishna's six younger siblings as soon as they were born, but failed in killing the seventh. The seventh was instead magically transferred to the womb of Rohini, a woman in the neighboring village of Gokula. This seventh was Balarama; an incarnation of Adishesha, the thousand-headed serpent, who was to become Krishna's lifelong companion. When Krishna was born, the doors to his parent’s prison magically opened. His father carried him away to Gokula, and exchanged Krishna for the newborn daughter of Yashoda. When Kamsa heard of the eighth child being born, he rushed to kill it. When he raised up the child, who was actually Yashoda’s child, in order to smash and kill it, the child slipped from his fingers, flew into the air and, before magically disappearing, told Kamsa that the eighth child was hidden safely away. Krishna spent his early life in sweet contentment among the people and cowherds of Gokula. Kamsa sent many demonic types to kill him, but Krishna, though just a small child, vanquished them all. When not destroying the demons sent to kill him, Krishna was a"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 Graha Sutras delight to all, and entertained them with the music of his flute and his constant pranks. At the age of fifteen Krishna left Gokula to kill the evil Kamsa and release his parents. Krishna thus became known as a hero and in his life destroyed many Asuras and Rakshasas. The people, therefore, always came to Krishna for aid and comfort. Krishna is best known for his role as friend, advisor and comforter to Arjuna and the Pandus during the great Kurukshetra war between the Pandus and Kurus, depicted in the Mahabharata. The spiritual teachings of Krishna are preserved in the Bhagavad Gita. The Moon indicates the early environment and the need to be loved and cherished. Krishna grew up in a contented atmosphere among the cowherds where he was loved and cherished by everyone. The Moon also rules cows as well as dairy and butter, Krishna’s favorite food. Krishna spoke always of the importance of Bakti (devotion) – keeping God always in mind. He loved his Baktis (devotees) more than all else, even more than Brahma and all the other deities. It is when the mind, the Moon, is kept centered in the heart that Bakti is cultivated. Among Avatars, it is many of Krishna’s activities that are questionable. But as his mind was always one with God – for, in fact, he was God, nothing he did could ever be construed as degrading to his spirit. Many things may befall a person and an individual may even be prompted by fate to perform less than idealistic deeds. In times such as these, the Moon allows a person to feel okay about themselves, if the Moon is well disposed. On the other hand, if the Moon is afflicted, even while performing good deeds an individual does not feel worthy, loveable or acceptable. Krishna means “dark,” even so dark as to be black. The Moon is the lord of the night, the time of darkness. Krishna was called this on account of having very dark skin. The fact that the two greatest and most famous Avataras: Rama and Krishna both had names that meant dark is significant. Black, darkness is that which is beyond creation. The world of Man is"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 29 illuminated by the Sun; the worlds of the heavens and afterlife are illumined by the astral lights. That which is God, which is that one pointed most tiny and most heavy from which all things manifest is dark. Black, therefore, symbolizes the highest state of spiritual realization, the state beyond all physical and astral forms of realization. For this reason the Graha of liberation, Ketu, rules black. This same idea holds true with respect to our Milky Way Galaxy and its center. The center of the Milky Way is thought to be a large black hole whose gravitational force is so great that is sucks in matter from its north and south poles with such force that it spews the matter out again at its sides, forming the spiral pattern of the Milky Way. The gravitational force of the center of the galaxy is so great that eventually all that which was spewed out will once again be attracted towards the galactic center, upon which a Day of Brahma, the Creator, will come to a close. The same happens in the evolution of Man. At first Man reaches further and further away from himself until he comes to realize that fulfillment is an internal process and then he seeks to look into himself until he becomes Guru (which literally means “heavy”), upon which he attracts everything towards himself, just like a black hole, and thus experiences all fulfillment. Nrisimha “Manlion” – Avatara of Mars Very long ago there was an Asura by the name of Hiranyakashipu. He had won many boons and had become very powerful. He conquered the three known worlds, forcing the Devas to become his vassals. The Devas appealed to the Supreme Lord Vishnu, who told them that Hiranyakashipu would soon have a saintly son and that when Hiranyakashipu was mistreating his son, He, Vishnu, would come and destroy him. Hiranyakashipu's youngest son, Prahlada, expressed all of the qualities of a saint. He was truthful, disciplined and loved all living beings. He had his senses under control and his conduct was faultless. Whenever his father asked him what he had learned, Prahlada spoke of the Lord. Needless to say his father was not"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 Graha Sutras pleased at this. He commanded Prahlada's instructors to teach Prahlada worldly ways and to make sure that he saw no devotees of Vishnu. Prahlada's instructors asked him who had instilled him with such thoughts. Prahlada answered that like iron attracted to a magnet his mind was always pulled towards God. With the threat of punishment they taught him their ways and he acted as though he was learning, but his mind was always with God. They then brought him to his father who was interested in his “progress.” Again Prahlada spoke of God. His father was enraged and commanded that he be tortured. Prahlada was undaunted by the tortures and continued to speak of God. Hiranyakashipu, therefore, ordered that Prahlada be killed. Though many methods were tried the Asuras were unable to kill this child of five. Prahlada's instructors finally told the king that since they were unable to kill the boy, in time he might reform, and so Prahlada was taken back to his studies. There then came a time when the instructors were away and Prahlada began converting the other students. When the instructors returned they were furious at this, especially since the other students would no longer heed them in their lessons. The instructors rushed to Hiranyakashipu who became enraged and decided that he would kill his son with his own hands. Hiranyakashipu then sent for Prahlada who came and greeted him respectfully. Hiranyakashipu chastised Prahlada, who remained undaunted, speaking only of God to his father in a respectful manner. Prahlada told his father that he could benefit from God who was greater than even him. His father asked him where this “Lord” was who was greater than he was. Prahlada replied that He was everywhere. His father asked him if He was in a pillar which he pointed to. Prahlada said that He was. Hiranyakashipu then told Prahlada that he was going to kill him now so, if indeed the Lord was in the pillar, He should come out and rescue Prahlada from death. Hiranyakashipu then hit the pillar with his great fist. There was a terrible noise and the pillar split. Out of it came Lord Vishnu in a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 31 terrible form. He glowed like molten gold. His head and face were that of a lion, his chest also. His lower half was that of a man. He was Nrisimha, the Man-lion. Everyone was afraid except for Hiranyakashipu. He thought what a strange beast this is; it is neither man nor animal. He then remembered the time when he had asked Brahma for a boon of immortality. Brahma had been unable to grant the boon, as he was not immortal himself. However, Brahma granted him that he would not be killed by one of His creations; he would not be killed by man or animal, during day or night, inside or outside, on the earth or in the sky. Brahma did definitely not create this thing that came out of the pillar; could this be his death? Hiranyakashipu, being no coward, hit Vishnu in His beastly form with his mace. They fought, until finally Nrisimha lifted him and carried him to the threshold of the hall; thus it was neither inside nor outside. The sky was deepening into darkness; thus it was neither day nor night. Nrisimha placed Hiranyakashipu in his lap, thus not upon the earth or in the sky. Being great himself, Hiranyakashipu was still unafraid. He looked at Prahlada as if to say that perhaps he was right, that there was someone more powerful than he. Nrisimha then ripped out his entrails, killing him. Upon fulfilling his bloody task, Nrisimha sat on the throne of the vanquished Hiranyakashipu. He was so angry that no one dared approach him, the Earth was trembling, and the heavens were scorching from His heat. The Devas went to get Lakshmi, the Lord’s consort. Even She dared not approach Him; She had never seen him so angry before. Finally Prahlada went to the Lord, who raised him up, His anger vanishing at the site of his beloved devotee. Nrisimha portrays the martial ability to fulfill a task through logic and necessary aggression, even when the task appears impossible. Hiranyakashipu was effectively immortal, having the boon to not die inside or outside, on Earth or in the sky, during day or night, by man or beast. For every problem or difficulty, there is a logical answer that Mars can provide, just as Nrisimha provided for"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 Graha Sutras the destruction of Hiranyakashipu. If Mars is strong and well situated in the horoscope the individual will have the capacity to logically work through problems. Mars, like Nrisimha, is very impassioned and fiery with his tasks. This fire is just for giving the energy to complete the task. As soon as the task is completed Mars relaxes, just as Nrisimha’s anger dissipated upon seeing the sound and unharmed Prahlada. If Mars is well situated in the horoscope, one’s anger is never frustration, but rather righteous anger that subsides as soon as an important task is complete. If Mars is weak, an individual will not have the necessary strength and passion to funnel into their tasks. If Mars is afflicted, the individual will easily become angry and frustrated when it is uncalled for, and even after fulfilling a task that required all their strength and energy, they will still remain restless or frustrated. Buddha “Awakened” – Avatara of Mercury Buddha means “awakened.” As a name of an Avatara, it is not quite clear which Avatara is meant, as there has been more than one great soul with this name. It is quite possible that Guatama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism is meant, who is certainly the Buddha who has had the largest impact upon Man, being the founder of the largest religion in the world. Buddhism ranks low as a religion in the medieval Hindu texts, which consider it an atheistic religion to some degree, since it does not revolve around the established Hindu gods. The medieval Hindu distaste for Buddhism is quite likely the result of the political turmoil of the times more than any differences in religious practices. Buddhism is more a religion of processes, methods and behaviors that bring about spiritual development than it is a religion of deities, which marks the Hinduism of the medieval period. The processes, methods and behaviors of Buddhism are all found, though perhaps in slightly different variations, in Hinduism, and Siddhartha was himself born a Hindu, so Buddhism is nothing different than a methodical and behavioral branch of Hinduism that has concentrated its studies on"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 33 the methods and behaviors rather than on the Hindu deities. Paramahamsa Yogananda similarly concentrated his teachings around methods and behaviors, leaving out the many colorful deities. Just as Yogananda cannot be classified as an atheist merely for not revolving his teachings around the Hindu deities, neither should the Buddha, Siddhartha. Siddhartha was born as a prince in the kingdom of Sakyas, on the border of present-day Nepal and India. Learned Brahmins who read his palms and bodily features declared that he would become either a world monarch, if he remained at home, or a Buddha, if he left home. But there was one Brahmin who said he would definitely become a Buddha. As a result of these predictions, Siddhartha's father was always concerned that Siddhartha might desire to leave home and become an ascetic. He therefore always did his best to influence Siddhartha in favor of the worldly life, keeping him happy and contented with every comfort and luxury. When Siddhartha was twenty-nine years of age his life took a sudden turn. When he was out driving with his charioteer he saw a decrepit, old man. Siddhartha asked his charioteer what had happened to the man. The charioteer explained that the man was old, that all men became old. This greatly perturbed Siddhartha. Another day he saw a sick man that had fallen in his own excrement. His charioteer, seeing that Siddhartha was perplexed, explained that the man was sick, that all men succumb to sickness. On another occasion Siddhartha saw a dead body. Again his charioteer explained that the man was dead, that all men must die. Next Siddhartha saw a man with a shaven head wearing yellow robes. He was impressed with the calm demeanor and serenity of the man. That day Siddhartha decided to follow suit and become a wandering ascetic. During the night he quietly slipped out of the palace, leaving his wife and newborn son. Siddhartha thus devoted his life to the search for truth and it was not long before he met two sages who became his teachers and through their teachings he reached very high spiritual states. This"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 Graha Sutras was not enough for Siddhartha who continued his quest for Truth. After almost dying from practicing severe bodily austerities for six years in a woodland grove along with five other ascetics, Siddhartha realized that such mortification could not bring him to what he wanted. He changed his ways and began eating and taking care of himself in a more balanced fashion. His five companions, on seeing this, lost faith in him and left in disgust. From this point forward Siddhartha followed his own path. Soon after he attained enlightenment at the foot of a Bodhi tree after determining that he would not rise from the foot of the tree before attaining enlightenment. After several tests he obtained his goal and became the Buddha. Buddha then began attracting disciples. His first disciples were the five ascetics who had earlier abandoned him. He spoke of a balanced “middle path” avoiding both self-indulgence and self-mortification. This became known as the Noble Eight-fold Path. This path consisted of right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right living, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Buddha's teachings rapidly spread through himself and his many enlightened disciples. Buddha is unique amongst the Avatars in that he was born with human consciousness being predominant and through practices became awakened. The other eight Avataras associated with Grahas maintained a consistency of divine consciousness from birth onwards. This process of the human consciousness becoming awakened is ruled by Mercury. The normal mind is only able to cognize the things of the material world. Enlightenment consists of the mind being awakened to where it may cognize spirit. While Jupiter rules all philosophical teachings, the actual practice of the teachings is governed by Mercury. Practicing, through the ability of Mercury, the teachings and methods of Jupiter, awakens one to the perception of Truth. If Jupiter is well situated in the horoscope, one will possess wisdom and the knowledge of spiritual practices and behaviors, but without Mercury, one will not effectively practice"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 35 that which they know in such a way as to awaken their consciousness. A further point in regards to Mercury’s importance in spirituality is that Mercury rules the Buddhi, the discerning intelligence that comprehends the Sat, “real substance” from the Asat, “unreal substance.” Each and every individual who, through practices and devotion, finds their mind awakened is a “Buddha.” Buddha, more than any other of the eight Avataras related to the Grahas, has treaded the path that all spiritual seekers tread. Vamana “Short Stature” – Avatara of Jupiter Long ago there was a great and powerful Asura by the name of Bali. He grew to such strength that he chased Indra, the king of the Devas, from the heavens. He then ruled the heavens and the world from what had been Indra's city. Bali's fame spread all over the world and though an Asura, he was famous, not only for his might, but especially for his unusual good character, fairness and generosity. The mother of Indra was unhappy over the vanquishing of her son by Bali. She performed a mantra upon which Vishnu came to her and told her not to worry; He would be born to her as a son in order to provide help to Indra and the Devas. A son was born to her who is known as Vamana. Vamana, as a small boy, approached Bali during a spiritual rite that he was performing. Such was Vamana’s brilliance that it appeared as if a bright light was coming over the horizon towards Bali and the other onlookers. When Bali saw that he who came was such a glorious Brahmin boy he honored him and fell at his feet. “Welcome,” said Bali, “by your coming I have been blessed. Tell me what I can do for you?” Vamana answered him; “I want from you three paces of ground measured by my stride.” Bali was taken aback, “You do not know what is good for you, boy. You are just a child. Instead of asking me for islands you ask me for three paces of ground measured by your tiny feet. Please,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 Graha Sutras ask again, and ask for enough land to keep you comfortable for all your life.” Vamana said, “If a man has not conquered desire all things in the world will not be enough to satisfy him. One who is not satisfied with three paces of ground will not be satisfied with the seven continents and all their wealth. I therefore ask you only for three paces of ground.” Bali was prepared to grant Vamana's request. At this time, however, Shukra (Venus), Bali's Guru, stepped in and said, “Do not give. He is deceiving you in order to help the Devas. He is Vishnu in disguise and with one pace of his foot He will cover the world, with another He will cover the heavens and the third step He will take on your head. You do not have to keep your promise of a gift to him, for he is deceiving you and intends to take all that you have.” Bali listened to his Guru and said, “I believe what you say, I do not have to honor my promise as all my possessions and security are at stake, but I do not fear losing all that I have. I only fear the infamy of speaking an untruth.” Shukra was angry with Bali for this and cursed him to fall from grace and lose all his wealth and success. Bali, however, was not perturbed by his Guru’s curse and granted Vamana's request. Vamana then grew to huge proportions and took the immense form of Lord Vishnu. With one step he covered the world, and with another the heavens. He then resumed the form of Vamana. Bali was then tied up, but he smiled, for he knew why the Lord had done this to him, to rid him of the two sins, “I” and “Mine.” By taking away all that he had, the Lord rid him of the sin of “Mine.” The Lord now wanted to show the world that only by surrender could one rid oneself of the sin “I.” Vamana looked at Bali, “You promised me three paces of ground. I have taken only two and there is nothing left. Tell me, where should I place my third step? You have not kept your word.” Bali was not frightened, “I do not consider my words to be lies there is still a place for your third pace. Please place your foot on"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 37 my head.” Upon which Vishnu in the form of Vamana stepped upon his head. Upon this, Brahma came to Vamana and said, “Please release Bali; he has given you all he has and has surrendered himself to you. He should be rewarded.” Vishnu then said, “When I want to destroy a man I grant him all the wealth and power in the world. He then gets involved in them and forgets his true nature. When I want to save a man from this delusion I take away his all. Becoming rid of all his faults he will become Mine. Bali has never swerved from the path of truth. Blessed by me he will become the Indra during the next Manvantara (another cycle of creation). Until then he will go to Sutala (a heavenly realm) where I will always be with him.” Vamana took everything from Bali, but after Bali surrendered to Him, He blessed him to be the next Indra. In the same manner Jupiter may take away in order to allow for greater blessings to follow. If Jupiter is well disposed in the horoscope, upon loss one looks with hope for a better future and sees the loss not as a punishment, but as an opportunity. If Jupiter is afflicted, however, the individual is unable to see past the loss or appreciate the benefits of the loss. Vamana graced Bali, a mere Asura, to become the next Indra, the next king of the Devas. In the same manner, Jupiter turns all that is gross into the most favorable, thus the influence of a strong and favorable Jupiter is always an asset in the horoscope. Bali had never swerved from truth and when he was ready to grow, Vamana, in taking, freed Bali from his attachments so that he could grow. In the same manner Jupiter, when we are ready to grow, may free us from those things that are preventing our growth. He particularly does this when in league with Venus (Shukra) during Jupiter/Venus and Venus/Jupiter Dasas. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 Graha Sutras Parashurama “Rama with the Axe” – Avatara of Venus Parashurama was the son of Jamadagni. Due to some misbehavior of his grandmother, Parashurama, though born in a Brahmin (priest caste) family, had the qualities of a Kshatriya (warrior). Once upon a time in the early life of Parashurama, Kartavirya, a powerful and arrogant king, came to the ashram of Parashurama’s father. So impressed was he of Jamadagni's divine cow of plenty that he stole her. When Parashurama found this out, he pursued Kartavirya and killed him and his entire army single-handedly, returning the cow to his father. His father was disappointed in him and scolded him for his impatience and for the sin of killing a king. He requested Parashurama to go on a one-year pilgrimage to the sacred rivers in order to purify himself of the sin. A year passed and Parashurama returned home. Shortly thereafter, his mother, while fetching water on the banks of the river, saw a demigod playing in the water and thought how handsome he was. When she returned, Jamadagni saw with his mind's eye the thought she had. The thought that a man, other than her husband, was handsome was a sin. Jamadagni called his sons and commanded they kill her. They were hesitant to kill their mother at their father’s angry command. Jamadagni then called Parashurama, who was his youngest son, and commanded that he should kill his mother and brothers. Without hesitation, Parashurama did so. Jamadagni was pleased with him and told Parashurama to ask for any boon. Parashurama asked that his mother and brothers be returned to life and that they not remember what had happened. In the meantime Kartavirya's sons were nursing their hatred against Parashurama for killing their father. During a time when Parashurama was out hunting, they came to his father's ashram and murdered his saintly father. When Parashurama heard the cries of his mother and saw his dead father he left everything in the hands"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 39 of his brothers, grabbed his huge ax and ran from the ashram. At that moment he had decided to kill all Kshatriyas. Parashurama killed all the 10,000 sons of Kartavirya, but this did nothing to appease his anger. His pride rampant, he would not brook any insult, not resting until he had punished the offender. With his pride as an excuse he went around the world twenty-one times killing Kshatriyas. He performed sacrificial rites to purify himself of the sins of killing so many kings. It is said that his purpose was to rid the world of evil Kshatriyas. A Brahmin by birth, he punished Kshatriyas that disrespected Brahmins. Parashurama was very loyal and devoted to his father. Venus is the Graha of loyalty and devotion. If Venus is well situated in the horoscope a person is capable of great loyalty and devotion. Parashurama instigated many a fight due to his pride, the pride that is a characteristic of Venus, the most proud amongst the Grahas. The pride of Venus is the pride that knows that all people are created equal and should thus receive equal treatment. Upon receiving insulting treatment from the evil kings of his day, Parashurama would instigate a fight. If Venus is well disposed in the horoscope an individual has a proper sense of self worth, of inherent pride. Individuals with an afflicted Venus suffer from a lack of self-worth and thus often find themselves in insulting or degrading circumstances. It is hard to imagine the gentle Venus being associated with the very ruthless Parashurama. Venus, however, rules the Water element which is responsible for providing growth. Death of one thing naturally leads to growth of another, for that reason Saturn, who is death, is exalted in Venus ruled Libra. The many deaths caused by Parashurama allowed for the upward mobility and growth of others, others in fact, who were more deserving than the evil Kshatriyas that Parashurama was born to kill. The highest use of death is growth – Saturn exalted in the Rasi of Venus. Likewise, in nature, the dead make the best fertilizer."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 Graha Sutras Parashurama spent much of his time performing rites that would free him from the sin of killing so many kings. Venus is the Graha that rules such cleansing and all those rituals and rites with which we may cleanse the stain of our actions. Kurma “Tortoise” – Avatara of Saturn Very long ago at the time of the very beginning of the world, there was, as usual, war in the heavens between the Devas and the Asuras. The Devas could not stand against the fierceness of the Asuras, and many of them were dying. Indra and the others thus went to Lord Brahma for help. Brahma advised that they pray to the Supreme Lord Vishnu. The Devas, along with Brahma, accordingly prayed to Lord Vishnu and asked him to take pity upon the plight of the Devas. Vishnu appeared and counseled them to make peace with the Asuras in order to buy time. He then stated that they must obtain the Amrita, the nectar of immortality, in order to thwart the death-causing Asuras. In order to obtain the Amrita they must churn the ocean using Mount Mandara. The task was so huge, however, that they would need the help of the Asuras. Vishnu promised that he would assist in the process and that he would moreover guarantee that the Asuras received none of the Amrita. Vishnu also cautioned the Devas that many things would come into manifestation from the churning of the ocean and that they were not to oppose the Asuras in anything that the Asuras desired; their only aim should be to gain the Amrita. The Devas thus made peace with the Asuras who agreed to help them for their fair share of the Amrita. First the Devas and Asuras attempted to carry the mountain, Mandara, to the ocean, but it was so heavy and they dropped it crushing many Devas and Asuras in the process. Lord Vishnu then appeared, lifted the mountain and carried it to the ocean. A serpent, Vasuki, was then tied to the mountain, so that the Devas and Asuras had something to hold onto as they churned the ocean. Vishnu and the Devas went to the head of the serpent and grasped it in their hands. The Asuras were"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 41 angry with this and complained that they would not hold onto the tail of the serpent as it was beneath their dignity. Vishnu and the Devas, therefore, allowed the Asuras to take hold of the head. The churning of the ocean then began, but the mountain was very heavy and sank into the ocean. This happened because they had failed to pay reverence to Lord Ganesha. Vishnu then dove into the water and took the form of a huge tortoise, Kurma, and lifted the mountain on his back. The Devas and Asuras were so concentrated on their difficult task that only a very few noticed why the mountain had sank and how it had come up again. The churning then began in earnest and the serpent being pulled upon belched fire and poisonous smoke, causing the Asuras to suffer greatly. The difficult churning continued and many things of great value and beauty rose up from the ocean. The Devas took only that which the Asuras did not want until at last Amrita rose to the surface in a vessel of gold carried by a divine-looking being. The Asuras quickly took the Amrita, ran away, and began fighting amongst themselves over who should have the first taste. The Devas appealed to Lord Vishnu, reminding Him of their promise to them. Vishnu told them not to worry, for had He not already promised them that they would receive the Amrita. A woman then appeared among the scrabbling Asuras – Mohini, a woman of such beauty that the Asuras stopped quarreling. Mohini, with her beauty and skillful glances, caused each and every Asura to believe that he was her favorite. The Asuras thus gave the Amrita to her and asked for her to decide who should taste the Amrita first, each believing that she would choose him first. She said that she would do so, but that they must promise to accept her actions, which the Asuras, fools in love, readily agreed to. This woman was actually Lord Vishnu who knew it was not right to give the Amrita to the Asuras because they were cruel by nature. He then, in the guise of Mohini, seated the Devas and the Asuras in separate groups. Her smiles and loving glances were all for the Asuras, but all the while she was giving the Amrita to the Devas. The spell of romantic glances and gestures she cast on the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 Graha Sutras Asuras prevented them from realizing that the Amrita was all being given to the Devas. They were so enamored by her beauty that they thought how terrible it was that the Devas could only think of the Amrita and had no appreciation of true beauty. They were quite happy for the Devas to have their share first, for they were enjoying a rare beauty and the Amrita could wait. One Asura, Svarbhanu, however, was not so foolish. Taking the appearance of a Deva, he sat between the Sun and the Moon and thus partook of the Amrita, upon which the Sun and Moon recognized him as an Asura and gestured to the Lord, who proceeded to cut off Svarbhanu's head with his Chakra (the ecliptic). The Amrita, however, had already fallen into Svarbhanu’s mouth, making him immortal. (Vishnu allowed Svarbhanu to become immortal because Brahma had previously granted a boon to this Asura that he was to become a Graha, and to become a Graha, Svarbhanu must live the long life of the universe.) Upon having his head severed, Svarbhanu's head became Rahu and his body became Ketu. Rahu and Ketu forever after have had bitter enmity with the Sun and the Moon which they “swallow” during an eclipse. After the Devas had consumed the Amrita, Mohini disappeared and Vishnu returned to his normal form. Though the Asuras had worked as hard as the Devas, they were not rewarded with any Amrita, as Vishnu had promised the Devas. Kurma made it possible to perform the difficult churning of the ocean by raising the mountain after it had sunk into the ocean and holding it on His back during the churning. It is Saturn who provides the capacity to persevere through difficult tasks. It is also Saturn who is slow and persevering, just like a turtle. Kurma lifted the great mountain and made the great process of churning the ocean possible, yet, only the very few most wise noticed this. Similarly, Saturn is responsible for performing all the many actions that usually go unnoticed, but which make great things possible. In society, Saturn rules the laborer whose actions often go unnoticed"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 43 but without which no great society could develop. If Saturn is well disposed in the horoscope an individual cannot only work hard, but perform the tedious, seemingly unimportant and unnoticed things that are the foundation of great deeds. The Asuras, being small-minded and empty beings, felt disrespected upon being placed at the tail of the serpent, upon which they promptly complained and demanded the “better” end of the serpent, the head. As it turned out, the head was the worst place to be and so the Asuras suffered terribly. In the same manner, Saturn often causes emptiness and lack that makes a person unwilling to accept what they are given and when they try to get or demand more, they actually end up with less. The Asuras churned the ocean with attachment and desire. The Devas churned the ocean with the goal of the Amrita which they needed for their divine survival. It was a simple matter for Mohini to charm the Asuras, as one desire is easily forgotten in the face of another. If Saturn is weak and afflicted and if one, as a result, performs actions with attachment and desire paramount, then one will not succeed as successfully in their goals, for there are countless desires that will be happy to interfere. Varaha/Sukara “Boar” – Avatara of Rahu In the beginning of the creation of this Kalpa (cycle of time), Brahma, the Creator, commanded his son to begin creating. “But please tell me where my creations are to live. The earth has been submerged during the great deluge,” his son replied. “She is now in the Nether Regions. Only if you can retrieve her I will be able to do as you wish.” Brahma thought to himself, “Lord, you have commanded me to create, so it is up to you to help me solve this problem.” Brahma then thought of the Supreme Lord and became absorbed in meditation. All of a sudden a tiny boar, Varaha, jumped out of his nostril and began to grow and grow until it had assumed immense proportions. All those who were watching realized that the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 Graha Sutras Supreme Lord had donned the form of a boar in order to raise the earth from below. The Supreme Lord then, in the form of the boar, plunged into the waters. Swimming to the bottom, He found the Earth and raising the Earth on his tusks, the boar began to rise up. A demon attacked Him as he was on is way up, but was killed after a ferocious battle. (This demon was the brother of Hiranyakashipu who would eventually be slain by Nrisimha.) Varaha then emerged from the water with the Earth, which he placed on the dents formed by his hoofs. Brahma and the others praised him and his glory, “We salute you and your wife, Mother Earth.” Varaha, after listening to their words, vanished from their sight, but not before giving the essence of Yagyas; rites for manifesting desires, making changes, and creating karmic balance. Varaha, the Avatara associated with Rahu, was necessary in order to create life on Earth, the physical plane, after the causal and astral planes had been created. Rahu indicates many deeper lessons and desires, and the need to create karmic balance in underdeveloped areas, which make it necessary for us to reincarnate on the physical plane. This is also symbolized by the Earth’s salutation as Varaha's wife. When Varaha was raising the Earth from the water, an Asura attacked him. Many “demons” of phobias, hallucinations, pretensions, confusions, compulsions and unfounded expectations similarly attack our consciousness as we attempt to develop the areas indicated by Rahu’s placement. Miina “Fish” – Avatara of Ketu At the end of the previous Kalpa, Brahma, the Creator, went to sleep and the world became submerged under the Waters. When Brahma was sleeping, an Asura stole the Vedas from him and disappeared under the waters. Previous to this event of the world becoming submerged under the Waters, a saintly king by name Satyavrata ruled the world. One day Satyavrata was performing his ablutions on the banks of the river Kritamala. When he took up the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Avataras of the Grahas 45 water in his cupped palm he found a tiny fish in his hands. He promptly dropped the fish back in the water. The fish spoke and said, “O king, have pity on me, I am so small and afraid of the big fish which threaten to eat me up. Please take me away and protect me.” The king was touched by the fish and took it home and placed it in a suitable vessel filled with water. The next morning the fish said, “There is not enough space, please place me in a wider pot.” Sure enough, the fish had outgrown his new home overnight. Satyavrata wondered at this and placed the fish in a much wider pot, but within an hour the fish had outgrown the new pot. Satyavrata then placed it in a pond and the same thing happened. He kept placing the fish in larger and larger ponds and lakes but the fish kept growing and complaining that it did not have enough space. Finally Satyavrata took it to the ocean and dropped it there. The fish said, “The Ocean is full of sharks and whales which will surely eat me up. Why did you bring me here?” Satyavrata smiled and said, “You are no ordinary fish. I know who you are. You are the Supreme Lord who has donned this form for some good purpose.” The Lord, in the form of the fish, then said, “You are right. Seven days from today the three worlds will be submerged under the Waters. The great deluge is coming. When the world goes completely under you will see a boat. Take your place in the boat with the Seven Rishis. I will be in the waters. When you see me, tie the boat firmly to me. I will play on the Waters for the duration of Brahma's night (the period during which Brahma is sleeping and creation is submerged), and you will be safely with me.” All happened as was said. The deluge came, the worlds were submerged and the Seven Rishis along with Satyavrata sailed away under the power of Miina. During the deluge Miina fought an Asura who had stolen the Vedas, which he returned to Brahma at the end of the great deluge, who would need them in order to create the worlds properly. The Lord, in the form of the fish, also taught Self-realization to Satyavrata."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 Graha Sutras Miina was a fish who was discontented with all smaller vessels except for the ocean of Spirit. Similarly Ketu is never contented with anything of the world and only finds contentment in Spirit. Miina taught the knowledge of Self-realization to Satyavrata and returned the wisdom of the Vedas; Ketu provides the Jnana (knowledge) of Truth and is the producer of Moksha, liberation.

In this Sutra, Parashara is asked if the Avataras of Vishnu (the name used in the Sutra for Vishnu is Ramaapati, “the husband of Ramaa,” Ramaa being a name of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity) have a portion of Jiva consciousness or whether they are possessed fully of Para Atma consciousness.

These four are the highest manifestation of God and being in their presence is considered no different than being in the presence of God. There is an interesting story that exemplifies this: One of the greatest of the ancient Rishis is Vasishtha around whom many ancient legends revolve. Vasishtha was directed to be the Guru of the Solar Dynasty, a task he did not wish and which he attempted to refuse since he did not wish to remain embodied on Earth. He was told, however, that one day, far in the future, Lord Vishnu would be born in the Solar Dynasty as a great king, as Rama Avatara. Upon hearing this Vasishtha was very happy to undertake the duty, even though it required him to serve as the Solar Dynasty family deity for generations before the fated birth of Lord Rama. The opportunity to meet a full Avatara was so great that even a great Rishi such as Vasishtha could not refuse, for being in the direct presence of God is a rare thing indeed, even for the greatest of souls such as Vasishtha. The other Avataras: Budha, Vamana, Parashurama, Kurma and Miina have a Jiva portion, which means that these Avataras were first born as living beings and through the spiritualizing influence of Time became predominant in Para Atma consciousness and where then reborn on Earth as great beings with the task of uplifting and protecting mankind. The fact that the full Avataras were brought forth through the Sun, Moon, Mars and Rahu is an important fact. These four Grahas, more so than the other Grahas, rule the self. The sun is the true self and the light of consciousness, the Moon is the individual"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 Graha Sutras consciousness, Mars represents how the individual exerts what is in his consciousness and Rahu represents the birth of the individual consciousness. Thus, these four Grahas all have to do with the self, though in very different ways, as you will come to see as you read this text. In the Kingdom of the Body, it is the self who is dominant and who rules, just as in the Kingdom of the World, it is God. Just as God has full sway and power, a full Avatara who is possessed of only Para Atma consciousness has full sway and power. Since the full Avataras were brought forth through the Sun, Moon, Mars and Rahu, these four Grahas are the Grahas that endow a person with presence and power. Individuals with these four Grahas prominent and strong have greater power to create, to make things happen and to rule in their lives. These people will more likely rule in their relationships, business, family, friendships and in their profession, which means to be self-employed or independently employed. If the Lagna or 10th lord is joined with one of these Grahas or if these Grahas are in the Lagna or 10th such will likely be the case. These Grahas allow the individual to be the master of their own lives in accordance with the general strength of the individual’s character and of these Grahas.

The last word in the Sutra above, “successively,” is of particular importance as it points out that the order of the Grahas, as mentioned in this Sutra, is the normal order of the Grahas. This is important as many Sutras give information about each Graha that is meant to be taken in the order of the Grahas. Many such Sutras will be presented later in this text. In regards to anything that is preserved in the Sanskrit language, the name by which it is known always has much to reveal. In addition to the names mentioned in the above Sutra, each of the Grahas has several names that are well worth studying. Names of the Sun The Sun has more names than any of the other Grahas, which is no surprise since the Sun is the most obvious object in the sky and a daily object of reverence of the ancient Vedic culture. The most common name of the Sun is Surya “the Supreme Light,” though the Sun is also commonly referred to as Ravi “the Fire"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 Graha Sutras Bird,” as the hot object soaring through the sky. Another very commonly used name of the Sun is Arka, “the ray,” as the prime illuminating ray of light and heat. The Sun is also known as Aditya “the Son of Aditi,” Aditi being the mother of the gods whose name refers to the ideals of freedom, boundlessness, perfection and infinity. The Sun thus represents these qualities to the greatest capacity that they can be achieved. The role of the Sun as the cause of the day is emphasized by his names Dinakrit, Dinakarta and Divakara, all which mean “the maker of the day.” As the producer of day, the Sun banishes the darkness of night as well as the darkness of the ignorance of the self. The Sun as Dinesha “the lord of the day,” repeats this idea and as Tamohanta, “darkness killing,” confirms the idea. Sunlight is known to purify and thus the Sun is known as Pusha and Pushan, both of which mean “the best purifier.” The Sun does this in the horoscope by representing the purifying fire of the body as well as representing the inexorable self that brings about the eventual purification of all our actions and desires. The Sun is Savita, “the vivifier,” as that which energizes and propels everything; as Ina, “the powerful,” as that which holds the greatest power over the Earth as the cause of the seasons, weather and even the course of the Earth, and as that which holds the greatest power in the horoscope. The Sun, being the soul, is also Hamsa, “swan;” swans being a symbol for the soul. The whiteness of the swan represents the purity of the soul, while the migratory nature of the swan represents the soul’s migration from body to body, life to life. The Sun is Mitra, a child of Aditi and the ruler of the Saura (solar) month of Sagittarius. Mitra means friend, and this name of the Sun symbolizes that the only true friend is the soul. As one discovers their soul nature, they thus become a friend to all – those who have reached the goal of self-discovery are the true friends of man. The Sun is also Shura, “hero,” giving the capacity to rise above oneself in order to fulfill great deeds."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 51 Obvious names of the Sun are Tikshnamsha, “hot rayed,” Tapana, “the burning,” Prabhakara, “radiance maker,” Bhanu, “light” and Bhaskara, “the light maker.” A more colorful name of the Sun is Aruna, which is the reddish color in the sky at dawn for which the Sun is responsible. Divamani, “the day jewel,” and Dyumani, “the sky jewel,” reveal the esteemed value of the Sun and all that it represents. Finally, of especial interest to astrologers, the Sun is known as Graharajna and Grahapati, the king and lord of the Grahas, which, of course, all revolve around the Sun. A surprising name of the Sun mentioned in the medieval Vedic Astrological texts is Heli, a Greek name for the Sun. Though the Sun is not referred to this name in the Sutras giving astrological techniques and Yogas, it is often mentioned by this name, along with other names, in the lists of planetary names given in several texts, most notably Brihat Jataka. The fact that this name of the Sun is found in the Indian astrological texts gives a hint of the interchange that took place between the learned men of the Greeks and the learned men living on the Indian subcontinent during the centuries following Alexander the Great. Names of the Moon The most common name of the Moon is Chandra, “shining.” Similar names such as Chandrama, Chandrika and Chandraka also refer to the Moon as the shiny orb in the sky. Indu, meaning “bright drop,” is also very commonly used for the Moon. The Moon’s relationship to the stars is a very important feature in Vedic philosophy and thus the Moon is known as Udupati or Udunatha, “the lord of the stars,” as well as Nakshatranatha, “the lord of the Nakshatras,” to whom the Moon is husband. In contrast to the Sun, the Moon’s light is cool and thus the Moon is known as Shitagu, Shitamshu, Shitarashmi and Himanshu all meaning, “cool rayed,” and as Shitadyuti, “cool brightness.” The Moon is the obvious sight at night and thus the Moon is known as Rajanipati and Ratrisha, “the lord of night” as well as Ratrimani, “jewel of the night,” and Nishakara, “night maker.”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 Graha Sutras The Moon is known as Vidhu, meaning “lonely” or “solitary” which is ironic in view of the fact that the Moon shares the heavens with his twenty-seven wives, the Nakshatras. Though having many wives the Moon still roams the skies looking to quench his love-sickness and though even having had an affair with Jupiter’s wife, his loneliness remains unquenched. It is because of this that an afflicted Moon leads to love affairs. The Moon is known as Kumudinipati, “the lord of white lotuses,” whose flowers open only at night. This appellation indicates that the Moon holds sway over all things active during the night. The Moon makes more erratic changes in latitude than does any other Graha and is thus known as Shashi, “containing a hare,” and as Shashanka, “hare marked,” as a hare similarly bounces along. The Moon is also know as Mriganka, “deer marked,” due to its markings which are thought to resemble the spots on a deer and also due to its gentle nature, which is symbolized by a deer. The Moon is Samudraka, “oceanic,” due to its influence on the tides. The Moon is also simply known as Glau, “the round lump,” and this may refer to the Moon being a lump that has separated from Earth. One last very common and very important name of the Moon is Soma, “juice,” which refers particularly to the juice of the sap in the plants and thus makes the Moon the lord of plants and vegetation. The juice is also the blood in the animals, the nectar of immortality of which the Moon is the receptacle, and all life-giving and nourishing fluids. Names of Mars The most common name of Mars is Kuja, “born of the Earth.” Bhumija, Kshitija, Mahija and Mahisunu mean the same and Bauma, “coming from the Earth,” represents the same idea. These names give the clue that Mars represents all those things that come from the earth – most notably minerals and gems. A more colorful name of Mars relating him to the Earth is Bhusutavadidhiti, “light brought"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 53 forth from Earth.” These names also confer the idea of just how life on Earth is, it is martial – a constant battle. Mars is also very commonly known as Mangala, “lucky, auspicious” as Mars represents the auspicious things of the Earth that a person can be lucky to find. It is a known fact that most of the large gold, valuable mineral and diamond deposits were stumbled upon by some lucky individual. More than this, Mars gives the luck to survive on Earth. When we look at the food chain, we see that it is just a matter of luck that some mice and insects live while most become food. While man is not part of the food chain, he has always been part of the destruction of nature’s fires, storms and quakes that leave one man’s house destroyed while his neighbor’s is left standing. One is indeed lucky to have an auspicious Mars with which to overcome the many difficulties encountered in the world. Mars enjoys the challenges of Earth and is thus known as Kshitinandana, “Earth Rejoicing.” Though having many auspicious faces, Mars is also considered as the cruelest of the Grahas as he can give great challenges and is thus known as Kruranetra, “cruel eyed,” and Kruradrik, “cruel sighted.” On account of the movement of Mars, which appears quite different from the perspective of Earth than that of the other Grahas, Mars has some interesting astronomically based names. Mars is known as Ara, “swift,” since he at times can move more swiftly than any other starry Graha. This is a very important point – though the average motion of Mars is relatively slow as compared to Venus and Mercury, occasionally he travels very quickly. For this reason, Mars provides the ability for quick, sudden bursts of heat, power, speed, excitement, and intensity. He is also Vakra, “crooked,” due to having more erratic motions than the other Grahas. Similarly he is known as Chara, “moving, changing.” Visibly Mars is red and is thus known as Rakta, Rhudhira and Lohitaka, all meaning red, as well as Lohitanga and Raktanga, “red-limbed.” Most probably on account of his red color, Mars is known"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 Graha Sutras as Gaganolmuka and Kholmuka, the firebrand in the sky and space respectively. He is similarly known as Angaraka, “charcoal.” Mars is related to Shiva as Shivagharmaja, “born from the heat of Siva.” This indicates the role of Mars as a Graha of penance and austerity, since Shiva is the lord of the Yogis. Names of Mercury The most commonly used name for Mercury is Budha, “awakening,” which refers to the intelligence that awakens from consciousness. Bodhana is also used to signify Mercury and has much the same meaning. This term signifies Mercury’s lordship over the intellect. Intellect is the faculty of the mind by which one can arrive at understanding and is of two kinds, perceptive and spiritualized. Perceptive intellect derives understanding from that which it can perceive, which is not always what is true. The understanding derived from perceptive intellect is also twisted by our personal perceptions, feelings and attitude. This is why humans, who are intellectually centered, tend to disagree over so many things. The bottom line is that perceptive intellect only allows us to arrive at limited understanding and not at the truth. Spiritualized intellect, known as Buddhi, is attracted towards that which is real and thereby helps us determine what is real. Mercury as Buddha represents the awakening of both these types of intellects, first by making us cognitive beings and then by attracting our cognizance towards that which is real. Along a similar vein, Mercury is known as Vid, “knowing,” and Jna, “wise.” An important related point is that Mercury is the offspring of the Moon, which is shown by its names: Induputra, Somaja and Vidhusuta, all meaning the child of the Moon. Similarly, Mercury is Saumya, “belonging to the Moon.” The Moon represents consciousness, and Mercury being the child of the Moon is that which comes from consciousness: cognizance and intelligence. Since Mercury is the child of the Moon, Mercury well placed can offset the poor effects of an ill-placed Moon. An ill-placed Moon, however, indicates Mercury’s source is weak and thus Mercury itself"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 55 cannot be as productive. These two Grahas influence each other and the full judgment of one cannot be made without considering the other. Mercury is friendly and is thus known as Priyakrit, “doing kindness,” and as Sushila, “good-tempered.” Mercury is not as bright as most of the other Grahas and is thus known, though very rarely, as Shyamanga, “dark-limbed.” Physically, Mercury does tend to give dark hair. Names of Jupiter The most commonly used name of Jupiter is Guru. Guru simply means heavy, and Jupiter is the heaviest of the planetary bodies orbiting the Sun. Guru has a secondary meaning in referring to those that are heavier in knowledge – the true weight of a man. Guru, therefore, also refers to Jupiter’s role as the spiritual teacher for which he has many names: Suraguru, Suracharya, Devamantri and Devejya, all of which mean, “the teacher of the divinities.” Jupiter’s role as the teacher of divinities refers to his role in providing spiritual, psychological and behavioral counsel. Jupiter’s counsel is directed towards our spiritual selves and helps us uplift ourselves above our daily problems and direct us towards God realization, thus he is the teacher of the divinities. Due to being the teacher of the deities, he is Sureshta, “desired by gods.” Jupiter is known as Vacaspati and Vagisha both meaning “lord of speech,” as well as Vacasampati, “lord of eloquence.” This would appear to infer that Jupiter grants speech, but that, as will be discussed later, is Mercury’s role. Jupiter, however, rules the sounds brought forth from the vocal cords, which are made meaningful as speech through Mercury. Jupiter is also the lord of speech in the sense that he is in command of what he says and only says what is worthwhile. He, in fact, says very little, but what he does say is well worth listening to. He does not waste the power of speech. His name of Mantra, the hymns of power, confirms Jupiter’s ruling over speech that has power and importance. Mantra also refers to the instrument of thought, and it is Jupiter that rules the organ of the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 Graha Sutras brain. In the philosophical texts, Jupiter’s most common name is Brihaspati, “lord of prayer” – again we see him not wasting his speech and indeed saying that which is most important. Several of Jupiter’s names refer to his venerability as he is called Arya, “honorable,” Ijya, “to be revered,” and Suri, “sage.” Jupiter is also known as Angirasuna, the son of Rishi Angira, who is one of the seven great Rishis. Only Jupiter and Venus, the two counselors amongst the Grahas, have the distinction of being born from Rishis. This is an important fact, for to give proper counsel, the counselor has to be able to relate to and understand those they counsel. Jupiter and Venus, being born from Rishis who, though divine, are human incarnations, can understand the suffering and state of man in a way that the other Grahas, who are not born from humans, cannot. Angira was one of the authors of the Rig Veda and Jupiter shares the spiritual knowledge of his father. Jupiter, in fact, rules the Rig Veda. Jupiter is also Apremeya, “immeasurable” due to ruling the ether and knowledge both of which are immeasurable. Jupiter has a particular ability to make things work out for the best and thus Jupiter is Samsiddhikarma, “connected with successful works.” For anything to be truly great, Jupiter must be influencing it. Even in a dismal horoscope, a well placed Jupiter can save the day. For this, as well as his wisdom, Jupiter is Puruhuta, “invoked by many.” One last very important name of Jupiter and also one very commonly used is Jiva, which means living or causing to live. Jupiter has an important role in producing life. He rules the liver, through which the newborn is fed and kept alive through the attachment to the umbilical cord. More importantly, Jupiter rules conception and offspring, the continuance of life. Jupiter’s name of Jiva has much deeper connotations when taken in regards to his name of Mantra. Mantra is much more than the hymns of power. According to Shiva, Mantra is that which maintains the life of all living creatures: “The in-breath and the out-breath, which together hold the life of all the living things of Brahma, even that of a worm, are called Mantra.” Through the proper awareness and use of Mantra, of the in-breath and the out-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 57 breath, a person becomes spiritually realized and thus Jupiter rules those spiritual practices that concentrate on the breath and upon the life force. Names of Venus The most commonly used name of Venus is Shukra, “bright” referring to Venus as the brightest of the starry Grahas. Sita means the same and Accha, “not shaded, clear,” conveys much the same meaning but hints at Venus’s lordship of clear things such as the lens of the eye and eyeglasses. Venus is known as Kama, “desire, love” and Ushana, “with desire.” These names are not to reduce Venus’s stature, but only to reveal that Venus is clear on its desires and what its desires will cost. Knowing these two things is necessary in order to safely negotiate the world of desires. For this reason, Venus is Kritajna, “knowledgeable in conduct,” and the Graha of manners and decorum. Venus is Bijanidhi, “store of seeds,” and thus rules all grains and seeds as well as semen. Seeds store the genetic material and so Venus rules DNA. Venus is Bhrigusuta and Barghava, the offspring of Rishi Brigu. Brigu is not one of the Saptarishis, but a very prominent Rishi nonetheless. He and his child Venus are amongst the best of astrologers and in myth are portrayed as better astrologers than is Brihaspati (Jupiter). As the child of a great Rishi, Venus is Kavya and Kavi, both meaning wise, insightful, poet, and a sage, names indicative of Venus’s ability to see meaning where there is none. Venus is Daityapujya, “honored by demons” and Daityaguru, “Guru of demons.” This is in contrast to Jupiter who plays the same role for the divinities. The demons of Vedic mythology are not the same as the crude fire dwelling demons of Christian imagination; they are more akin to the giants of Greek and Norse myth. As the Guru of the demons, Venus’s counsel is that of the non-secular realm. Venus counsels by providing practical advice that improves a person’s lot in life and by giving predictions."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 Graha Sutras Predictions can be made with a system such as astrology, but many predictions can be made with simple understanding and common sense: “if you do this, this is what will happen.” Venus is master at making predictions both ways. Providing practical counsel and making predictions comforts a person’s fears, worries, doubts and insecurities, thus Venus is the teacher of the demons of fear, worry, doubt, etc. An astrologer who provides spiritual counsel and counsel that helps one understand oneself is using Jupiter, while the astrologer who provides practical counsel and predictions is using Venus. Like Jupiter, Venus is the offspring of a Rishi and can thus relate to the human condition and provide meaningful counsel. Venus is Dinavejya, “offering to the miserable” in its role as nurse, comforter and counselor and as Shodashamshu “sixteen rayed,” sixteen being a number that symbolizes the comfort and ease that Venus can provide. Names of Saturn On account of Saturn taking the longest time to transverse the heavens, the most common names of Saturn are Shani and Manda, both meaning “slow” and so Saturn rules all that is slow. Similarly, he is Shanaishcara, “slow moving.” Why is he slow? Because he is Pangu, “lame,” and rules all those things that are somehow crippled or only partially operating. Saturn is the furthest of the visible Grahas and thus not very visible and he also has a darker color than the other Grahas. Saturn is thus known as Krishna, Kala, both meaning “dark,” and as Asita, “not bright.” Saturn is quite commonly known as the child of his parents, the Sun and Shadow. As Suryaputra, Arki, Taranitanaya and Sauri he is the offspring of the Sun. As Chayasunu, Chayasuta and Chayatanaya he is the child of Shadow. The more important aspects of Saturn can be understood by his parentage. Sun and Shadow, two opposites, two irreconcilables and two inseparables and Saturn is their child, in fact, their illegitimate child. No wonder that Saturn is miserable and represents our psychological complexes. Spirit, the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 59 Sun, manifesting the created world results in separation between the spiritual consciousness and the individual consciousness. The misery indicated by Saturn is the result of this separation. The Sun and Saturn, as father and child, influence each other and the full judgment of one cannot be made without considering the other. If the Sun is ill placed in the horoscope, but his child Saturn is well placed, the low self-esteem indicated by the poor Sun will not be as seriously injured, nor will Saturn be as strong in resisting its fears since his father is weak. Yet more significant, if Saturn is poorly disposed, which indicates greater fears and vulnerabilities, but the Sun is well disposed, the person will have a stronger foundation with which to resist the fears of Saturn. Saturn often goes under the name of one of his presiding deities, Yama, the deity of death who leads disembodied souls into one of the darker or brighter regions of the astral world in accordance with each individual’s merit. Saturn, therefore, is a measure of a person’s merit; it particularly is a record of a person’s ill merit. Yama literally means, “Restraint” and thus Saturn is the Graha of self-restraint and represents the very important and difficult to maintain “won’t power.” Through the will power of the creative Sun and the won’t power of Saturn, which prevents us from doing things that would set us back, all great successes become possible. Surprisingly, Saturn is Prasiddha, very accomplished. Saturn in the right place makes a person the most accomplished, whereas a poor Saturn makes accomplishment impossible. Anything done has its tedious aspect that most do not enjoy. Without a favorable Saturn nothing great can be accomplished, since the tedious work necessary to complete the activity perfectly will not be done. Also, any great accomplishment requires the solitude necessary to perfect the skill, idea, mind, body, etc. Without a favorable Saturn, one will not enjoy or take advantage of the necessary solitude. Finally, Saturn is known as Pratitakarma, “acknowledged action,” and thus indicates that which we are convinced that we must do and that which we are resolved to do. Saturn not only"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 Graha Sutras makes clear that which we must do but, when strong, makes us resolute in doing so. Names of the Moon’s North Node The most commonly used name for the north node of the Moon is Rahu, “the seizer,” in his role in seizing the Sun and Moon during the time of eclipse. Rahu is considered to especially enjoy eclipsing the Moon and is thus Vidhumtuda, “moon troubler;” Rahu eclipsing the Moon will cause more trouble than will Ketu eclipsing the Moon, all other factors equal. Rahu has no actual form that reflects light and is thus known as Agus, “without rays” and as Tama, “darkness, gloom,” which also refers to his nature of indicating that of which we are ignorant. Rahu is considered serpentine and is thus named Sarpa, Phani, Bhujanga, Bhujaga and Ahi. His name of Phanindra, the serpent king reveals his importance and that he is no ordinary snake. Phanindra is the great thousand-headed serpent, Shesha, who couches and canopies the sleeping Vishnu during the dissolution between cycles of creation, of whom more will be told later. Rahu also goes by the name Svarbhanu; the Asura that was cut in half after the churning of the ocean whose story was told previously as part of the story of Kurma Avatara. Svarbhanu means “space of light” which could likely refer to the space through which the Moon travels and it is this space that is severed by Vishnu’s famed weapon, the Sudarshana Chakra (the ecliptic), and thus Svarbhanu is severed in half, creating Rahu and Ketu. Rahu started his existence as an Asura and having become immortal and more powerful and important than any other Asura is known as the Asura. Rahu also has some less desirable names, two of which are Ghata, “destruction” and Pata, “falling.” Rahu is very capable of bringing about both of these if he is poorly placed in the horoscope or severely afflicting other Grahas. He can destroy that which is desired and have us fall from position, fall from grace or fall into"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Names of the Grahas 61 despair. Pata also means, “descending,” and Rahu also indicates that for which we must descend to Earth. Names of the Moon’s South Node The most commonly used name of the south node of the Moon is Ketu, “flag.” Another of its names, Dhvaja, means the same. A flag is used to mark one’s territory. Ketu is the flag in the horoscope that marks the “territory” that one has been most involved in during their recent past life. Like Rahu, Ketu has no physical form and thus he does not reflect light as do the embodied Grahas, however, he is not considered to have quite the darkening effect of Rahu and thus he is only called Dhuma, “smoky, misty” and Dhumra, “smoky, dim,” as compared to Rahu’s dark names. Ketu is the bottom half of what remains of the Asura Svarbhanu and is thus called Puccha, “tail.” Upon the severance of Svarbhanu, not only Ketu, but also all comets are thought to have come from Svarbhanu’s lower half. Thus Ketu is also called Shikhi, “pointed flame” and Anala, “fire,” on account of comets appearing as flames in the sky.

The remaining Grahas are Saumya (gentle). Mercury is Krura if joined with a Krura.\" Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Nature and Form of the Grahas, 11 There are several ways in which Grahas are divided into supportive and disruptive influences. One such way is based upon their natural tendencies. On account of their natural tendencies there are two distinct types of Grahas: Saumya “gentle” Grahas and Krura “cruel” Grahas. Saumya Grahas are those Grahas whose innate nature causes them to be helpful, supportive and comforting towards those other Grahas that they influence. Krura Grahas are those Grahas whose innate nature causes them to be harmful, disruptive and pain causing towards those other Grahas that they influence. Each Graha has an ill as well as a desirable aspect. The essential difference between cruel and gentle Grahas is that a cruel Graha gives whatever ill it has to the Grahas that it influences while holding back anything desirable that it may have. A gentle Graha, on the other hand, gives whatever desirable thing it may have to the Grahas that it influences while holding back any ill that it may be suffering. In this way Grahas operate exactly as do people: A cruel person gives whatever trouble he can to the people he is around and holds onto any desirable thing he may have for himself. A"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 Graha Sutras gentle person, on the other hand, gives whatever desirable thing he can to the people he is around and holds back any ill that he may be suffering. Krura Grahas provide the many lessons and hardships in life while Saumya Grahas provide the capacity to learn the lessons and the aid to survive them healthily. Krura Grahas provide the stress that is strengthening while Saumya Grahas provide the comfort which is nurturing. Together they help a person to develop healthily. Alone, Krura Grahas would only break a person’s mind and body, while Saumya Grahas alone would only cause excess and stagnation of the mind and body. Regardless of whether a Graha is Saumya or Krura, each Graha has something desirable and good to give. Saturn, for instance, represents longevity and the ability of the body to resist bacteria before succumbing to disease. Mars represents buildings, without which none of us would have a home. Each Graha is very important for our survival, well-being and happiness. Grahas manifest effects on many different levels. It is only in the context of being supportive and disruptive towards each other’s natural indications that Grahas behave as Saumya and Krura. On other levels any Graha may be supportive or disruptive, so do not be too quick to judge any one Graha’s effects. Any Graha, for instance, can be productive or destructive towards the Bhava in which it is placed, and this has nothing to do with its Krura or Saumya nature. As a result of this, Krura Grahas will quite often produce very good things and Saumya Grahas will just as often disrupt desirable things. It will be noticed that there are more Krura Grahas than there are Saumya Grahas. There are many Kruru Grahas: Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu, the Moon during the half time that it is waning and Mercury when joined with a Krura Graha, while there are only a few Saumya Grahas: Jupiter, Venus, the Moon during the half time that it is waxing and Mercury when Mercury is alone or joined"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Saumya and Krura Grahas 65 with a Saumya Graha. This fact reveals that life is very hard. There are more Krura Grahas, which give difficulties, lessons and hardships than there are Saumya Grahas, which give ease, comfort and luxury. This reveals what we already know, Earth is no paradise, it is a school for personal development and we are constantly having our character strengthened and tested by the Krura Grahas. Every significant event in life, whether it is a favorable or unfavorable event, comes in order to awaken the individual to spiritual realization. The Saumya Grahas represent the validation of our self and the support that we can lean on, while the Krura Grahas are the hard knocks that we need in order to wake up and the painful realizations about ourselves with which we must come to term. Saumya and Krura Grahas are similar in the fact that on account of their experiences, they attempt to find happiness, security, well-being, etc. by developing the Bhava in which they are placed. The experiences of Saumya Grahas, however, are quite different than the experiences of Krura Grahas. Saumya Grahas support the natural indications of the Grahas which they influence. As a result of the individual experiencing the resultant peace and happiness the individual has the time, luxury and resources to develop the Bhava in which the Saumya Graha is placed and in developing that Bhava, they find fulfillment. Krura Grahas harm the natural indications of the other Grahas that they influence. The harm, loss, pain, etc. that the native experiences motivate the individual to grow and change and to become strong, which they do as they develop the Bhava in which the Krura Graha is found. Sun The Sun represents the growth of the self, which is the result of sacrifice and thus the Sun is a Krura Graha. The natural effects of those Grahas which the Sun influences are those things from which a person becomes separated. In becoming separated from these things, the individual realizes the importance of being an honorable,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 Graha Sutras dutiful and inspired person. In separating us from these things, the Sun demands that we become better people, stronger, more able and more self-reliant – a person better able to provide for others. On account of the losses that the Sun causes towards those Grahas that it is influencing, a person becomes inspired to become the best of what they can be in the context of the Bhava in which the Sun is placed. For example, if the Sun is placed in the 10th Bhava, a person becomes inspired to be the best leader that they can by, in the 3rd Bhava the Sun inspires a person to be the strongest and most talented that they can be, in the 2nd Bhava the Sun inspires a person to become the most responsible that they can be. In whichever Bhava the Sun is placed, a person works towards being the best they know how to be as a result of suffering the losses of those Grahas that the Sun influences. On account of experiencing separation in respect to those things indicated by the Grahas that the Sun influences, the individual will come to realize that they can never truly be part of something or bonded to something of this world. All they can truly possess and be with is their own honor and esteem and so they attempt to develop the Bhava in which the Sun is placed as a means to live honorably and not so that they can share and find happiness in the things of the Bhava, which can never bring the experiences of the soul that one is truly desiring. Moon When the Moon waxes, the Moon builds and grows, when the Moon wanes, he releases and lets go, thus the waxing Moon is Saumya and the waning Moon Krura. The Saumya waxing Moon causes those things indicated by the Grahas which it influences to grow healthily and to flourish. These things then become a source of abundance and fulfillment for the individual. As a result of experiencing the abundance and fulfillment, the Moon attempts to develop the Bhava in which it is placed, this Bhava being a very important potential source of peace and happiness for the person. On account of experiencing the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Saumya and Krura Grahas 67 happiness and fulfillment with those things indicated by the Grahas which the waxing Moon influences, the person develops the healthy mental attitude with which to attempt to develop those needs that they have in respect to the Bhava in which the waxing Moon is placed. The Krura waning Moon causes those things indicated by the Grahas which it influences to wither and wane, resulting in these things being unable to provide fulfillment or happiness. As a result of experiencing the wane of these things and the lack of fulfillment, the individual is forced to come to terms with the need for inner, rather than outer, nourishment. The individual will then be able to attempt the development of the Bhava in which the waning Moon is placed, not for the sake of the fulfillment which the Bhava may provide, but for the sake of the internal growth that occurs as one develops the Bhava. Mars Mars represents the struggles and efforts we make to find security in a world full of threats and dangers. All these things are difficult and painful, and so Mars is a Krura Graha. The natural effects of the Grahas that Mars influences become things of great difficulty, struggle and pain, which cause the native to realize the importance of their security needs; just as a child who scrapes his knee realizes the need of their mother as they rush, crying, to her. Due to the pain and difficulty experienced in those things ruled by the Grahas that Mars influences, the native does whatever it takes to carve out the security they seek, this security being founded in the Bhava in which Mars is placed. For example, if Mars is placed in the 2nd Bhava security will be founded upon wealth and family, in the 9th Bhava upon philosophy and knowledge, in the 6th Bhava in the practical ability to fight the ills of the world, in the 3rd Bhava upon one’s will and strength, in the 10th Bhava upon power and authority, in the 5th Bhava upon one’s intelligence. On account of experiencing pain and frustration in respect to those things indicated by the Grahas that Mars is influencing, the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 Graha Sutras individual will be very protective and defensive at the slightest hint of danger to the Bhava in which Mars is placed and they will fight furiously to protect and establish the indications of that Bhava. As the individual emotionally matures and becomes stronger, they realize that to be secure is a state of character and a state of consciousness, at which point they will strive to develop a healthy consciousness and character. They will then find it much less important to fight and struggle for a security that is, at best, only fleeting. Mercury Mercury represents the application of our intelligence and skills, the communication that is a necessary part of virtually anything, and the concrete manifestation of all things. The natural effects of those Grahas influenced by Mercury are realized through the application of one’s skills, intelligence and communication, or simply because these things are meant to manifest as part of a person’s material life. The individual not only realizes the concrete manifestation of all those things ruled by the Grahas that Mercury influences, but also attempts to be skillful and productive in respect to the Bhava in which Mercury is placed. If Mercury is joined with a Krura Graha he becomes the “apprentice” of that Graha and will thus have similar lessons to teach and shortcomings to reveal as that of the Krura Graha that he joins. Mercury will still maintain many of his positive qualities, especially that of being able to pull things together and make them happen, but these things will be directed only towards the Bhava in which Mercury is placed and the Krura Graha with which he joins and not towards the Grahas that Mercury influences. Those Grahas that Mercury influences will suffer the same fate as the Krura Graha joining Mercury would cause. Mercury will likewise attempt to develop the Bhava in which it is placed along the same lines of that as the Krura Graha that it joins. When Mercury becomes Krura due to joining a Krura, simply treat Mercury as if he were the Krura Graha that he joins."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Saumya and Krura Grahas 69 If Mercury is joined with both a Krura Graha and a Saumya Graha, then he will behave as his normal Saumya self if he is closer to the Saumya Graha, but if he is closer to the Krura Graha, he will behave as a Krura. Jupiter Jupiter represents wisdom, abundance and “luck” or “grace.” The natural effects of those Grahas that Jupiter influence abound and may have their liabilities overcome through luck and grace. Wisdom will guide the native in the enjoyment of these things while forgiveness and understanding will help maintain the favorable constancy of these things. The application of wisdom and abundance will also be directed towards the Bhava in which Jupiter is placed, which will be a Bhava that the individual will likely enjoy in abundance and a Bhava in which the individual will have innate knowledge. Venus Venus is full of love and devotion towards that which is fulfilling and helps us to make decisions that result in our highest fulfillment. The natural effects of those Grahas that Venus influences flourish under the light of love and we are able to evaluate these things accurately, even to find meaning in them when there seems to be none, and thus Venus helps us make the most effective decisions regarding these things. The Bhava in which Venus is placed is a Bhava that we attempt to develop through love and devotion, and a Bhava which we will understand in a multi-dimensional manner. Saturn Saturn represents the attrition and perseverance we develop as we weather the many difficulties and losses of life, thus Saturn is a Krura Graha. The natural effects of the Grahas that Saturn influences are those things that the individual loses, if not entirely,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 Graha Sutras at least partially. Suffering loss in respect to these things causes the individual to attempt to hold onto and make the most of those things indicated by the Bhava in which Saturn is placed. The person will not necessarily be successful in holding onto these things – that depends upon the capacity of Saturn. They will, however, make their best effort and suffer as much difficulty as they are able before relinquishing. On account of experiencing loss in those things indicated by the Grahas that Saturn influences, the individual will experience fears revolving around the possible loss of those things indicated by the Bhava in which Saturn is placed, however, these are mere fears. If they are able to persevere through these fears they will find that Bhava to become a fulfilling Bhava in their life. The more they develop the Bhava, however, the greater the fears may become and thus they must be careful to have a conscious attitude towards their fears and worries and not a compensative attitude which will only cause the eventual loss of the Bhava or the inability to enjoy the Bhava. Rahu Rahu represents the birth of the individual consciousness. The birth of the individual consciousness separates from all that is true and thus Rahu is a Krura Graha. This quality of separation extends to the material world and thus the individual is separated from the indications of the Grahas that Rahu is influencing. On account of experiencing this separation, the individual attempts to develop the Bhava in which Rahu is placed. The sting of Rahu’s separating nature leaves a residual consciousness of separation, which makes it impossible for the individual to fully enjoy the fruits of the Bhava in which Rahu is placed. Not being able to fully enjoy the fruits of one’s efforts, the individual must necessarily turn towards that which may grant complete fulfillment, which brings us to Ketu. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Saumya and Krura Grahas 71 Ketu Where Rahu is the birth of the individual consciousness, Ketu is the termination of the individual consciousness. The individual consciousness becomes terminated upon being absorbed in the holy vibration, AUM, and thus Ketu is the producer of spiritual liberation. This terminating nature of Ketu, though the best of all things, is harmful towards those things that exist in this world and thus Ketu is a Krura Graha. On account of Ketu’s terminating nature, the natural indications of those Grahas influenced by Ketu are destroyed. As a result of experiencing this destruction, the individual realizes his personal limitations and attempts to develop the Bhava in which Ketu is placed, not for its mundane concerns, but as an avenue towards developing a wider and more all-encompassing vision. The limited consciousness is thus expanded.

While any Krura Graha can equally harm the Grahas that it influences, the different Krura Grahas will cause a different degree of pain when they do harm the Grahas that they influence. Similarly, while any Saumya Graha will support the Grahas that it influences, the different Saumya Grahas will cause a different degree of happiness and comfort when they do provide their support. Amongst the Saumya Grahas, the waxing Moon is felt the least gently, Mercury more gently, Jupiter yet more gently and Venus is experienced the most gently. Venus is thus the greatest of the Saumya Grahas. Venus is experienced the most gently because he provides the greatest comfort and luxury and fulfills one’s heartfelt needs to the greatest extent. Jupiter is just one step behind and while he offers the greatest protection against adversity, he does not grant the same level of comfort that does Venus and so is not considered quite as gentle. Mercury certainly helps one to get ahead, but requires an equal effort on the part of the individual and so is not as enjoyable to experience as are Jupiter or Venus. The waxing Moon certainly provides for the healthy growth of those Grahas it is influencing, but only because our attention is focused upon them. We must then use the abilities of the other Grahas to bring about the success of those things upon which our attention is focused, and so the Moon is the least gentle of the Grahas. Amongst the Krura Grahas, the waning Moon is the least cruel, Mercury with a Krura is a bit crueler, the Sun is yet crueler, Saturn is much crueler than the Sun and Mars is the cruelest. The waning Moon certainly causes us to let go of those Grahas that it is influencing, but there will be the need to let go and so the loss will not be as painful. The waning Moon is thus the least cruel of the Krura Grahas. Mercury joined with a Krura Graha is only slightly crueler and while causing difficulties with those Grahas it is influencing, it does so on account of being involved with those things that are felt as more urgent.

Saturn is much crueler as he causes separations that are more or less permanent and which are experienced as a huge loss. Most of Saturn’s separations, however, are those that one expects in life. All things come to an end in time. Those we know and love will die or, at the very least, we will part from them. These are the types of separations that Saturn causes and, their being normal to life, they are not the cruelest because they are more or less expected – they are the painful eventualities of life. Mars, on the other hand, is the cruelest, for he gives the crisis and pains that are not part of the natural process of life and death – the unexpected and sharp pains of life. The smashing accident, the fire that burns, the attack of a mugger – the dire things that happen but which are not the norm. CONCLUSION Krura means “cruel” and refers to what is generally termed a malefic. In this text we will use Krura/cruel, as it describes the effects of these Grahas more accurately than does malefic. Saumya means “gentle” and refers to what is often termed a benefic. Saumya/gentle is a much more accurate term of a Graha’s nature than is benefic, so we will use that term in this text. The Saumya and Krura quality of the Grahas represent their innate natures. Saumya Grahas are gentle, kind, accepting, comforting and support the natural indications of the other Grahas that they influence. Krura Grahas are cruel, hard, demanding, stressful and harm the natural indications of the other Grahas that they influence, all while forcing us to work on ourselves if we want to be happy. Saumya Grahas will always be supportive in some instances and Krura Grahas always disruptive.

Combined, the Grahas represent the complete living, breathing and functioning person. Sun – Sarva Atman Sarva Atman means, “Whole Self.” This has several connotations. Spiritually, Sarva Atman is the soul and thus the Sun represents the soul. Soul, of course, being beyond creation, cannot be truly represented by anything in creation, including any Graha. What the Sun actually represents is the individual’s intuitive knowing of his or her soul nature. The intuitive knowing of one’s soul nature provides confidence, self-esteem, nobility and the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 Graha Sutras capacity to sacrifice the things of the world for higher purposes. The Sun thus represents all of these “soul” qualities. Physically, the “whole self” represents the body. The Sun thus represents the body in its entirety. A robust and non-afflicted Sun largely insures the integrity and health of the physical body. Being the “whole self” the Sun represents us as a complete person. A person with soul and body, a mind, character, communicating what is in his or her consciousness, possessing the capacity for knowledge and joy, with vital energy and bearing one’s sorrows. In short, a person made up of all seven Grahas. Moon – Manas Manas is the mind, but not the Western idea of the mind of intellectual processes, but rather the mind that experiences. Through Manas, all the five senses are experienced and in experiencing the five senses, one is receptive to the qualities of creation and thus lives and breathes in the world. Manas consists of Jiva, the living consciousness, and Ahamkara, the “I,” the idea of separate existence. The Jiva is the living being of consciousness that experiences the entirety of creation through the five senses. The first thing which the Jiva experiences is itself, which gives rise to the ego, and thus the Jiva is always accompanied by ego. The ego is nothing more than the idea of separate existence. The idea of separate existence gives rise to the consciousness of “I,” which creates the consciousness of “Mine,” and all the resulting attachments. The Moon thus represents the individual consciousness experiencing all of its joys and sorrows. Mars – Sattvam Sattvam is strength of character. Character is nothing more than the manner in which an individual expresses themselves in life. The strength with which one does this is Mars. Said another way, the strength which with one lives his convictions is Mars."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Self Aspect 77 The Jiva, the living individual, as we have seen is found as part of the Manas and is thus represented by the Moon. How one perceives the world is represented by the Moon and thus an individual’s convictions are also formed by the Moon. Mars thus represents the strength with which we express that which is in our consciousness, which is much the same as saying that Mars is the strength with which we live our convictions. Mars is, therefore, the strength with which we express our Moon, our individuality, our convictions, our character. The Manas of the Moon is naturally pure in character; only when the pure nature becomes corrupted does the mind become impure and the individual caused to suffer. Mars, therefore, most essentially represents the strength to express that which is pure in one’s consciousness. Mars thus represents all actions to do good, to develop and to become better. Mars is the Bhramachari, the celibate student who, taking no care for himself, concentrates on training and strengthening his body, mind and spirit. In conclusion, Mars represents the expression of good character. When afflicted, however, the desire to express goodness can become twisted and warped or frustration may develop with the result that the individual expresses the very illness that they had hoped their goodness would overcome. Note: Sattvam in this Sutra is often translated simply and imprecisely as “strength,” inferring that Mars represents one’s physical and perhaps mental strength. Mars is much more than that, as has been discussed. Mars, in fact, has nothing at all to do with raw physical strength. (The training and discipline of Mars do, however, serve to hone one’s physical strength.) Mars rules athletes not because athletes require strength, but because athletes attempt to be the best they can be in the discipline that their mind has attached them to. The raw strength of the athlete, however, comes from Venus.

Whatever an individual may say, be it in anger, in joy, in jest in or in seriousness, for them to say it, it must be in their consciousness. Listening to what a person says, not only when they are serious or when they claim to be telling the truth, but at all times, reveals that upon which their consciousness dwells. Myth has it that Mercury is the son of the Moon. The individual consciousness from which speech emerges is ruled by the Moon. While the spoken consciousness, or speech, is ruled by Mercury. In this instance we can see the truth of this myth as the speech of Mercury is born from the consciousness of the Moon. Jupiter – Joy Giving Knowing Jupiter represents the knowing of that which is true and joyous. Knowing this, there is contentment with the world and happiness within. In order to be happy with anything, we have to know happiness. The unhappy person is happy with nothing, while the truly joyous person is happy with everything. The stronger and better situated Jupiter, the more knowledge there is of joy. Those Grahas influenced by Jupiter represent those things through which we may more readily know joy, and thus happiness can easily be found in these things. Venus – Virya Virya is virility, from which stems strength, energy and luster. Virility is the force that invigorates our bodies and impassions our activities. Venus represents the strength of our bodies and the vigor we put into those activities that are important to us. To possess bodily strength and vitality is to possess a happy body. To live enthusiastically and passionately is to live happily. Venus provides for both of these. Whatever we may hope for, whether it is spiritual or mundane, if it is not pursued with enthusiasm and passion, it will"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Self Aspect 79 not be captured and thus Venus is important for invigorating all of our activities. A robust Venus in the horoscope increases bodily strength and vigor. The body becomes more capable of recovering from the ill effects of disease, from the difficulties of surgery, from traumas to the body and from hard physical exertions. On account of providing the body the ability to recover from physical exertion and on account of providing strength, Venus is found to be an important Graha for athletes. Without a healthy Venus the body will not be strong enough or capable of recovering from the hard training necessary for peak athletic performance. The virility of Venus is not limited to the body and so a robust Venus will likewise assist in recovering from and getting over the painful traumas and changes in life. Note: Virya is often translated as “semen.” While virility is most concentrated in the semen, it is virility that is meant – not the seminal fluid itself – which has nothing to do with the Grahas in respect to composing an individual personality. Saturn – Sorrow Saturn is that part of us which provides for sorrow, difficulty, pain, etc. The word used in the Sutra to describe that part of us which is Saturn is Duhkha, which literally means “bad emptiness.” This is very revealing as the pain and sorrow of Saturn is the result of the emptiness that we carry within. In this respect, Saturn is the opposite of Jupiter. Where Jupiter represents the knowing of joy, Saturn represents the emptiness where nothing is found or known and thus only the “badness” of pain and sorrow are experienced. Indeed, for us to feel unhappy with anything we must first have the unhappiness within us, the empty vacuum of pain ruled by Saturn. For us to feel lonely, we must first have the vacuum of separation and isolation within us.

The Grahas also play these very same roles in the kingdom of the self. Sun and Moon – The Sovereigns The Sun and Moon are the two sovereigns. The Sun is the king and the Moon the queen. In a democratic society the Sun is the president or elected official in charge and the Moon is the gentle face of the presidency – normally the first lady. In the kingdom of the self the Sun and Moon are also the rulers – the Sun the soul and the Moon the individuality. The Sun gives the self the intelligence and confidence with which to act, the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 Graha Sutras strength of the king. If the Sun is well situated the individual is confident, acts intelligently, steadfast and reliable. If the Sun is afflicted, the individual is insecure, inconstant and acts out of fears, compulsions, peer pressure, etc. In short, not due to their intelligence. The Moon provides social confidence and the ability to interact, the strengths of the queen. If the Moon is well situated, the individual is secure in relating to others, is sensitive to others and enjoys interacting with his fellow man. If the Moon is afflicted, the individual is uncomfortable in relating to others, insensitive and shuns relating with his fellow man. Mars – The Overseer Mars is the overseer, he who directs, at the command of the two sovereigns, all the important activities of the kingdom. He does this as the commander in charge of military activities, as the engineer in building projects, as the knights of ancient days, etc. Mars is the right arm of the king and queen who acts upon and attempts to fulfill all of their directives. In the kingdom of the self, Mars is the logical faculty with which we govern and direct our actions. Whatever may enter our minds and whatever we may hope to do, we must exert ourselves in such a way as to achieve it, which means to act logically. If Mars is well situated in the horoscope, the individual exerts himself in such a fashion that is sure to result in the achievement of their goals. If Mars is poorly situated in the horoscope, the individual will exert himself in such a way that success can only elude him. Note: The Sanskrit word to describe Mars is Neta, which means “guiding” and alludes to the idea of guiding in the fashion that the eyes (Netra) guide us. Neta, in this Sutra, is often translated as “army chief,” however, that is a somewhat limited view as Mars is he who leads and guides any project. I have translated the word simply as “overseer,” he who sees to it that what is to be done is done, whether he oversees the army, security, the national forests, government construction, etc."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Planetary Kingdom 83 Mercury – The Young Sovereign Mercury is the young sovereign, the crown prince who will govern the kingdom upon the demise of the king. Mercury, being the young sovereign, shares many of the leadership, managerial and inspirational abilities of the Sun. In fact, it is only through Mercury’s speaking and negotiating abilities that one can lead, manage and inspire effectively. A solid Mercury is an asset to every ruler’s horoscope, without which they are bound to mismanage their country. In medieval times when kings reigned, a king who did not produce an heir was a failure to his country, and his failure invariably led to conspiring and bloodshed as many sought the power of the throne. In the kingdom of the self, the young sovereign represents the intellect, the intellect being how much of ourselves we consciously know and understand. The intellect, being the young sovereign, has much to learn and has many inaccurate perceptions, but as it ages and matures, it more and more learns the true nature of itself until it becomes ready to inherit the throne – which is to grasp the true nature of itself and all things. At this point the intellect is awakened to the truth of things and becomes Buddhi, the discerning intelligence that comprehends the Sat, “real substance” from the Asat, “unreal substance.” If Mercury is well situated in the horoscope, the individual is able to understand that which they put their minds to. If Mercury is afflicted, preconceptions, misconceptions and personal conceptions will interrupt their ability to see the true nature of that which they are attempting to understand. The Sun is itself the soul, but it is only through Mercury that we are able to cognize the omniscience of the soul, for this reason Mercury orbits closest to the Sun. As we mature spiritually, we cognize more and more the true nature of things, until we are awakened to the knowledge of the soul. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Graha Sutras Jupiter and Venus – The Counselors Jupiter and Venus are the two counselors to the king. Jupiter is full of spiritual wisdom and thus counsels along the lines of religion. His advice is such as to help the king understand his duty and himself. Jupiter is the Pope, the spiritual Guru, the psychologist, etc. In the kingdom of the self, Jupiter provides for our philosophical nature, which directs us towards a meaningful life of purpose, happiness and virtue. The cornerstone of our philosophical nature is our wisdom, which provides for a healthy and happy outlook. If Jupiter is well situated in the horoscope, the individual finds each moment to be full of purpose and happiness, regardless what they may find themselves doing. They thus enjoy a life of contentment and activity natural to their self. If Jupiter is afflicted, the individual finds each moment to lack meaning and purpose and either falls into despair or seeks meaning and purpose, but often in ways and things which are not innate to their nature. Venus is full of worldly knowledge and thus provides advice on handling practical and mundane concerns. Venus is the diplomat, the president’s advisory cabinet, the minister of state, the counselor on human relationships, etc. In the kingdom of the self, Venus provides for our evaluative nature, our capacity to evaluate and make choices. In all the large as well as small choices which we must make everyday we evaluate our options in order to decide which option is more worthwhile. Venus helps us to see which option is the most worthwhile. If Venus is well situated in the horoscope, we make worthwhile choices in life. Worthwhile choices being those choices that provide for health, fulfillment and a solid foundation in the world for spiritual development. If Venus is afflicted, the individual is unable to healthily evaluate the worth of their opportunities and will thus often choose that which results in debility and depression and which destroys the foundations in their life, their marriage, their health, etc. The cornerstone of our evaluative capacity is our self-worth.

The individual with an unhealthy Venus does not recognizes his inherent self-worth and instead believes himself to be more deserving or of little worth. In either case, they will then evaluate the choices in life against an inaccurate measure. Saturn – The Menial Saturn represents menials, of which the majority of the kingdom exists. Saturn performs all those many tasks, though often unnoticed, which if not performed, nothing great could be done. Saturn also rules all those people who perform tasks that are routine, boring, tedious or undesirable, but which if not performed would cause the quick collapse of society. In the kingdom of the self, Saturn represents one’s ability to do what they have to do, even though they may have no desire to do it. Even in performing great tasks, there are many tedious, boring and routine things that must be done. Saturn provides the ability to do these things. Also, life is a progress of moving forward and so one often finds him or herself at the bottom of the ladder. Saturn provides the ability to be at the bottom and still find happiness in what one is doing. If Saturn is afflicted, a person struggles with being at the bottom or is unwilling to be at the bottom, even though it may be necessary in order to achieve their goals. Rahu and Ketu – The Army An army has two purposes, to defend and protect secured territories, and to move outward and conquer new realms. This is what Rahu and Ketu do in their role as the planetary army. Ketu represents the reserve armies that maintain and protect the sovereign country and established territories so that there is always a safe place to fall back and recuperate. Established areas eventually run out of space, resources, adventure, etc. This gives rise to the desire, or need, to march into undiscovered realms. This task is"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 Graha Sutras given to Rahu; the aggressive front of the army that marches forward to conquer new territory, often with little knowledge of what the march may bring.

Rahu rules all exploratory and conquering forces while Ketu rules all protective “at home” forces. Rahu, for example, rules the CIA, Ketu the FBI. The armies of Rahu and Ketu do the hard work of expanding the kingdom. In the kingdom of the self, this means expanding the consciousness of the self and thus Rahu and Ketu represent the path the self must travel in order to grow and develop. Rahu indicates the new territories towards which we must march if we hope to grow and become stronger. Ketu represents the areas where we find security and fall back upon in times of stress or duress, just as an army falls back upon being overcome.

Many translators incorrectly translate this Sutra as referring to the colors of the Grahas in the context of which color a house, vehicle, or some other such object may be. The Sutra, however, very clearly states limbs and bodies, so the fact that the complexions of the human form are meant is obvious. Furthermore, if the actual color of objects were meant, we would expect to at least be given the full spectrum of primary and secondary colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. But they are not. There is in fact, no authoritative Sanskrit text that provides actual colors for the Grahas. The reason being is that the Grahas rule those things that have tangible form, while color is an effect of light, not form and, therefore, cannot be ruled by the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 Graha Sutras Grahas. Colors are rather bestowed by the twelve Rasis, the Bhachakra “circle of light.” Some Western astrological texts do provide colors for planets, though none of them even remotely agree. The fact that none of them come close to agreeing reveals that these are simply poor attempts to define something that is not meant to be defined. Complexion, on the other hand, is ruled by the Grahas because complexion defines the physical form. Complexion defines the physical form in accordance with race, with each of the Grahas ruling one race. This Sutra, therefore, is not simply stating the different complexions, but also the race that each Graha rules. The authors of the ancient astronomical texts knew of the Earth being round and that the Sun took six months to rise at the poles at least a thousand years before Columbus. So it should not come as any surprise that Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra would make mention of the different races of man. Categorizing the many, many races of Man is no easy task, as any sociologist or evolutionary scientist will admit. The problem stems from at least two thousand years of trade between races and regions which has quite naturally resulted in a great intermingling of the races. Additionally, there are distinguishable genetic characteristics between the different Native American civilizations and also distinguishable genetic characteristics between the different regional races of India, the different Asiatic races, the European races and so on. These many racial groupings, however, have some distinctive as well as geographic similarities that allow them to be loosely grouped together into one larger racial group for each of the seven Grahas. Sun – Reddish Brown The Sun rules the brown race that has a tinge of red. It is difficult to know for sure what race exactly this is. A likely candidate is the brown race of the Indian subcontinent, for this race has a tinge of ruddiness to the hair and even the skin. As the race of the Sun, we would expect to see solar qualities in this race. Indians have"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Complexions and Races of the Grahas 89 records of dynasties from the ancient times and have, as per the nature of the Sun, steadfastly maintained a continuance of culture much more so than any other race. India’s Surya Siddhanta, if legend is true, is the oldest astronomical teaching in existence that is said to have been provided by the Sun itself. More so than any other race, Indians live in the cradle of the world’s spirituality, with Buddhism having come from an Indian and even Christ was visited by “the three wise men from the East,” who are rumored to have been Indians. Moon – Fair The word used to describe both the Moon and Jupiter is Gaura, which means fair. Other translators of this Sutra, however, translate Gaura as white for the Moon and as yellow for Jupiter, which is not correct. Rather, the Moon and Jupiter each rule one of the fair skinned races, with the Moon ruling the fair skinned European geographical race. One of the unique qualities of the fair European area race is that a much greater percentage of the people have the ability for Lactase production into adulthood, whereas a larger percentage of people of other races tend to lose the ability for Lactase production after infancy. Lactase is the enzyme responsible for digesting Lactose, the sugar found in milk and it is the Moon that rules milk and all dairy products. The changeability of European culture is also in accordance with the nature of the Moon. European cultures have been marked by change much more so than other cultures and so there is not the consistency of culture as that possessed by the other races. The Moon’s adaptive behavior, however, has allowed this race to evolve very rapidly to become a power in a very quickly changing world over the past 500 years, leaving the other races to catch up. Now that the industrial and electrical age has settled in, the other races are beginning to come to great power and it won’t be long before the other races enjoy the power and success of the Northern European race.

The Native Americans lived in harmony with the Earth and recognized the divinity of nature and the interdependence of Earth, life and heaven. Since Mars is the child of the Earth, we would expect to see such a philosophy in the Native Americans. Native Americans were largely nomadic and lived for adventure, honor and most importantly the path arranged for them by nature. Some, however, were great engineers and architects responsible for building the largest pyramids in the world, which are located in Central America. While most of the Native Americans that lived in North America reside on reservations, there are many Native American tribes living their traditional lifestyles in South America. The Mars race is also very populous as the mixed Mestizo race (European and Native American mix, including Mexicans). Mercury – Brown Grass (Golden Brown) Mercury rules those of the color of brown-grass. This part of the Sutra is often incorrectly translated as, “green like grass,” since the translators incorrectly believe that spectral colors are meant; not understanding that it is actually the complexions and races of the Grahas that are being defined. The word brown is very clear in the Sutra and it is only by ignoring that word that the “translators” are able to arrive at “green like grass.” Brown grass is golden brown and thus the golden tinged Asiatic race is meant. The Asiatic race is not only found in Asia, but also found as the Aleuts of the Aleutian Islands and the Eskimos of Western Alaska. The Asiatic race is marked by an artistic culture, right down to their script, which is more art than letter. It is Mercury that represents the skill of art. The Asiatic culture has a tradition of healing that is 5,000 years old if not older and it is Mercury that is largely responsible for creating healers. Asiatic cultures have been rich in inventions and the intellectual acumen and business skill of the Asians is well known and respected these days – all these things being ruled by Mercury."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Complexions and Races of the Grahas 91 Jupiter – Fair Jupiter rules the fair race of the Middle East, which extends into North Africa and includes the Egyptians, Persians, Babylonians, Mesopotamians, Jews, etc. and all of their modern derivatives.

One of the symbols used in India for Jupiter is a drawing board, revealing Jupiter’s connection to literacy. While India has been the cradle of the world’s spirituality, the Middle East has been the cradle of the world’s most influencing religions, with Judaism, Christianity and Islam all having originated there. Venus – Brown Venus rules the brown race, which is most likely the Polynesian race. Polynesians were great sailors, the greatest sailors of ancient times sailing thousands of kilometers, and it is Venus that rules vehicles and the Water element. Over the past thousands of years, many now unoccupied Pacific islands were inhabited by Polynesians. While the Polynesian race is the smallest race these days, scientists are certain the Polynesian population was once much larger and that it is indeed an ancient race of immense size and achievement. The brown-skinned Micronesian race (of Guam, Yap, Pohnpei, etc.) is classified separately by scientist on account of their different (relatively) recent geological origins, but can be considered to fall under the rule of Venus as well. These people of Venus are marked by large strong bodies, in accordance with Venus ruling Virya and in accordance with Venus ruling the Water element which is responsible for “increasing,” as will be discussed in the “Five Elements” chapter. Saturn – Dark The Native Africans, Australian Aborigines and the Melanesians of New Guinea are of the dark race ruled by Saturn. The Native Africans on the one hand and the Australian Aborigines and"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Graha Sutras Melanesians on the other hand have several physical and genetic differences on account of the different geological regions that they occupy, much like the differences found in the many Asian races or like those found between the Polynesians and Micronesians. These dark races, however, can all be classified under Saturn. The Negro races have, more often than any other race, found themselves on the hard end of the political or economic scale and have thus suffered greatly, but as is Saturn’s nature, hardship has not diminished the Negro population nor prevented great men and women to emerge from this race. COMPLEXION The seven Grahas caste their racial colorations upon the individual: The Sun castes a reddish brown. The Moon and Jupiter lighten the complexion. Mars causes ruddiness, Mercury a rich golden brown, Venus the brown of a natural healthy tan and Saturn darkens the caste. These influences, however, must be considered in respect to the racial background of the native as the Grahas will have somewhat different influences upon the complexion depending upon the race. The Sun grants a brownish red complexion, which may appear coppery. In those of European descent the Sun often manifests as a copper tone to the hair and coppery colorations to the skin. In excess, the Sun creates redheads in the fair races. Saturn, in all cases, darkens the normal tone of the race. In Negroes and the brown races, Saturn indicates much darker skin. In fair races, Saturn indicates dark brown or black hair and a slightly darker shade to the skin. The Moon and Jupiter lighten the complexion. In those of fair races, the Moon and Jupiter create blondes. In the brown and dark races, the Moon and Jupiter merely lighten the skin and hair. Venus tans and bronzes the fair races and increases the luster of the other races, while Mercury adds an attractive golden tint.

More than one deity operates through each of the Grahas, thus there are seeming contradictions between different texts. It is not that these texts contradict each other, rather on different levels of existence and activity there are different deities. The most useful arrangement of deities is given by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Jaimini’s Upadesa Sutras. The deities that operate through the Grahas in order to establish and maintain creation are those provided by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. The deities related to the Grahas in Upadesa Sutras are those that indicate the different types of spiritual paths to which the truth seeker may devote him or herself.

"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 Graha Sutras Vahni/Agni – Sun Vahni literally means, “Conveyor” and alludes to the idea that Fire conveys that which it burns upward, to the “realms of the gods.” This Fire itself is known as Agni. Agni and Vahni are interchangeable names for this very same Fire. Like fire is hidden in wood, Agni represents the spirit hidden in matter. Agni is the cosmic light that permeates all things, thus being the support of all things. To return to this light is to lose form, just as are the sacrifices that are consumed in the fire. Agni, as the presiding deity of the Sun, “burns up” in sacrifice those things which one must necessarily be removed from, so that one may become a greater being. To sacrifice is to give up something small; something that one can afford to give up, though the giving up may be painful in order to achieve something greater. The sacrifices demanded by the Sun are, therefore, gateways to greater opportunities. Ambu – Moon Ambu is simply Water, Water being the cosmic force that grows all that is. While Agni permeates all that is, what is created and what grows, changes and adapts does so through the force of Ambu. Ambu is thus the lord of all creative forces. That which is created and that which grows must die and decay. That which dies and decays serves as nourishment for that which grows. That Water causes both growth and death and decay is shown in nature. When it rains the plants immediately begin to grow. The plants are then eaten by other life forms that then also grow. Upon the expiration of life, the more water the dead plant or animal life form is exposed to the more quickly it decays, water being the universal solvent. Also, during the great transitional periods on Earth, Ambu, in the form of great floods and tides, causes death and destruction on a wide scale, such as that experienced by the biblical Noah. On account of this dual nature of water, the Moon has both a waxing and waning period. The waxing period is the period during which Ambu creates growth. The waning period is the period during which Ambu causes decay."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Presiding Deities 95 Ambu, being a deity, not only governs the force of water, but also governs the force of consciousness which causes both the growth of and the letting go of all the things in our life. When we hold strongly in our consciousness some desire, ambition or goal, the force of Ambu causes that which we hold in our minds to manifest in our lives. When we have had enough of something our consciousness lets go of it, upon which Ambu allows it to drift out of our lives. Varuna Varuna is another deity associated with the Moon. Varuna means “all enveloping sky” and refers to the God of the Firmament who placed, according to the Rig Veda, the Nakshatras in the heavens. In later mythology Varuna is considered as the god of the oceans and water, in which case he must rule Ambu. In older Vedic mythology, he is not strongly associated with water, so he is not identical with Ambu, though sharing many of the same qualities. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra gives Ambu as the presiding deity of the Moon, for on Earth it is water that is responsible for growth. In the Vedas, Varuna is considered as the most excellent and preeminent of all deities, as the primal maker and upholder of the universe. Varuna can be looked upon as the greater force of consciousness that grows and creates the universe while Ambu may be considered as that very same force specifically upon Earth. Both Varuna and Ambu being forces that create and grow reveal the importance of the Moon-ruled mental attitude in creating our reality. Shikhija/Kartikeya – Mars The presiding deity of Mars has several commonly used names: Skanda, Subramanya, Kartikeya, all referring to the second son of Siva. The name of Shikhija used in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra means, “producer of the peacock” on account of Kartikeya defeating an Asura whom he then turned into a peacock. The peacock then became his vehicle."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 Graha Sutras The peacock symbolizes the evolutionary trend of spirit over matter. Spirit is unconscious in the minerals, conscious in the plants, semi-self-conscious in the animals, self-conscious in man, and super-conscious in the enlightened man. That Kartikeya brought forth the peacock and that he rides the peacock reveals that he is the master of the natural process of evolution. There is a natural order to this evolution that, like mathematics, is perfect in its logic. Logic is the means by which Mars arrives at knowledge and logic is a very important part of the spiritual process, for the very process of evolution follows a pattern of ordered logic. The great astrologer and Guru, Sri Yuktesvar, emphasized the importance of logic in saying of spiritual matters that if they are not logical they are not true. The very process of our earthly experiences enlightening us is ruled by Mars, who is Kuja, “born of the earth.” Kartikeya is the god of war, though he is just a seven-day-old child. He is the supreme warrior-general among the Devas, who commands the armies of the Devas in their battle with the Asuras and leads them to victory. Within man, Kartikeya represents the perceptive power of the pure and innocent mind that has the discrimination to control the passions and lend them a spiritual focus. He does this by freeing the mind from its concepts and ideas, these being what we fight for, rendering the mind more innocent (like the mind of a child) so that it may have true perceptions. The mind that is filled with personal concepts and perceptions is unable to see the simple truths and simple paths, which are the logical truths and logical paths. It is because the mind of Man is filled with personal concepts and perceptions that men ceaselessly argue amongst themselves, even when they have a common goal. Kartikeya, through Mars, reveals these incorrect concepts that we cling to due to personal weaknesses by causing us to feel frustrated and angry about things. Where we are angry is where we need to establish innocence and pure perceptions, upon which the inner war of the Devas and Asuras is won by the higher aspect of Man symbolized by the Devas."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Presiding Deities 97 Vishnu – Mercury Vishnu is considered as the absolute aspect of God who has manifested a portion of Himself as the whole created universe. Through the property of the Mercury-ruled Earth element, the One has been differentiated into the many. The many have only been differentiated, not changed; they are still the One known as Vishnu. Thus all that Is is a manifestation of Vishnu. All that sees is Vishnu. All that gives is Vishnu. All that is given is Vishnu. All that receives the gifts is Vishnu. Vishnu gives Mercury the ability to perceive what is real, which is Vishnu. There is nothing else. On account of this, Mercury is a very important Graha to consider when judging an individual’s capacity to have true spiritual perceptions while living on the earthbound, material plane. Vidauja/Indra – Jupiter Vidauja means, “Power of the people” and is an appellation for Indra. Indra is the king of the Devas and thus represents the most powerful source of succor for Man as well as symbolizing the greatest source of strength within Man. Indra is portrayed very differently in the age-old Vedas than he is portrayed in the latter mythological Puranas. It is Indra’s portrayal in the Vedas that is important, for the Puranas do not have the sanctity of the Vedas. In the Vedas, Indra is one of the most important deities, ranked in importance with Agni, the presiding deity of the Sun. This is quite an interesting fact since Jupiter, being the heaviest of all the Grahas, has a significant impact on the motion of the Sun and the solar system.

The Sun rotates around the Barycentre in approximately twelve years, the time it takes for Jupiter to make one revolution around the Sun. It is Jupiter and the Sun, therefore, who have the largest impact upon the solar system and who are presided by the two all-important Vedic deities, Agni and Indra."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 Graha Sutras Indra is witnessed as the lord of thunder and lightening and the resulting rains and has many parallels to the great Thor of Viking mythology. Indra primarily gives succor to the people through providing the all-essential rain, which falls upon the Earth following the clash of Indra’s lightening bolt that shatters the dark clouds, allowing the rain to fall. Esoterically a symbolically similar event takes place. The “lightening bolt,” of the spinal energies is brought upward through spiritual practices and thus “shatters” the “dark clouds” of ignorance, watering the perceptions with the rain of higher consciousness. Indra is the all-conquering and means, “one who is the conqueror of the Indriyas,” the Indriyas being the senses. This conquering takes place upon the satiation that comes from spiritual perceptions, just like the conquering of thirst is brought about by the fall of rain and not simply by imagining oneself not to be thirsty. Conquering the senses is not brought about through forced renunciation, but only by spiritual practices which give a “taste” of something better than that for which the senses beg. This is an important point for the spiritual aspirant to consider. All too often the spiritual aspirant, hearing about the behavior of saints, attempts to behave in a spiritual way which is not natural to their way of being, when what is necessary is to practice spiritual rites until the behavior of a saint becomes a natural by-product of one’s experiences. Many who study scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita without full attention fall into this same trap. In “Chapter One” of the Bhagavad Gita, the players in the Great War, the war which takes place within each spiritual aspirant, are introduced. In “Chapter Two” the behavior of a Spiritually realized soul are dictated, but in this chapter Krishna does not state that one should attempt to behave this way, he merely illustrates the Goal. In Chapter Three and the following chapters the means to obtain this goal are given. It is important that the spiritual aspirant focuses upon practicing these means; else one is in the danger of falling into hypocrisy or, worse, imagining him or herself to be possessed of a more exalted spiritual state than they actually are."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Presiding Deities 99 Sachi – Venus Sachi, or Sachi Devi as she is more appropriately called, is the consort of Indra. Sachi accompanies Indra in all of his exploits, though more so in spirit than in body. Sachi is very much the “woman behind the man” who is Indra. Only through the talismans that she places upon Indra is he able to become victorious. Sachi empowers Indra and is inseparable from him. She thus has equal influence, though working behind the scenes. While Indra represents the active divinity that succors man, Sachi is the passive divinity who heals, nourishes and satiates without her presence even being known. If she is scorned, if the good she has to freely offer is rejected, she quickly becomes angry and jealous and, thereafter withholding her gifts, man succumbs to illness and ill fate. Indra performs the actions which allow for well-being and satiation, but Sachi is the object of well-being and satiation. Indra is the thunder and lightening which frees the rain from the clouds, but the rain itself is Sachi. And the rain is, of course, an aspect of Ambu. This relationship between the three of Indra/Jupiter, Sachi/Venus and Ambu/Moon is revealed by the fact that Jupiter is exalted in the Rasi of the Moon, the Moon is exalted in the Rasi of Venus and Venus is exalted in the Rasi of Jupiter. Inwardly, Sachi/Venus and Indra/Jupiter have a similar effect and always accompany each other. Indra/Jupiter represents virtuous action and moral deeds, but Sachi/Venus gives the healthy pride that empowers Man to live virtuously. If Venus is afflicted, an individual does not have the self-respect necessary for good actions to feel worthwhile. Indra/Jupiter represents the spiritual practices, but Sachi/Venus represents the devotion which motivates the spiritual seeker and the satiation that comes from the performance of the practices.

Brahma – Saturn Brahma is the Creator who has actively created the three worlds of Heaven, Earth and the Nether Regions. In order to manifest creation, the Absolute must hide behind a veil in order to give the idea of creation being separate from Himself. This veil is termed as Maya and is created by each individual's Avidya – ignorance of his soul nature. It is Saturn who is responsible for this Avidya. Saturn creates this ignorance through governing the flow of the life force into the nerves. As a result of the life force and, therefore, the consciousness descending into the nerves, we perceive things as soft, solid, bright, dark, colored, hot, cold, mother, father, etc. In other words, not as God, and thus the created worlds of Brahma are experienced. In this way Brahma requires Saturn in order to create. Yama A common deity associated with Saturn is Yama, the god of death, who leads the disembodied souls into one of the darker or brighter regions of the astral world according to each individual’s merit. The word Yama means “control” and specifically self-control. Among all forms of self-control, the control of the life force is the most essential. Through Yama, there is the enforced control of the life force as it is withdrawn from the body at death. Saturn is the Graha that represents death as well as the restraining self-control of “won’t power,” which is so necessary for avoiding many of the ills, both small and large, of life.

Prayer to and Puja (honoring) of Agni strengthens foundations, supports all that needs supporting and alleviates difficulties experienced in the periods of the Sun. Prayer to and honoring of Ambu assists in manifesting that which is in one’s consciousness and in letting go of what is no longer desirable or necessary, while also alleviating any difficulties experienced during the periods of the Moon. Prayer to and honoring of Kartikeya assists in combating difficulties, whether external or internal frustrations, while also alleviating any difficulties experienced in the periods of Mars or Ketu. Prayer to and worship of Vishnu assists in seeing the truth of things, whether mundane or spiritual, while also alleviating any difficulties brought about in the period of Mercury. The Vishnu Sahasranama is particularly effective and recommended by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra for remedying ills under Mercury’s periods, while also being of great spiritual benefit. (The regular practice of the Vishnu Sahasranama was, in fact, also recommended by Adi Sankaracharya, the enlightened reorganizer of the Hindu monastic orders.) Prayer to and honoring of Indra uplifts one’s consciousness and brings those things into one’s life that are of benefit to one’s physical and spiritual survival and progress, while also alleviating any difficulties brought about in the periods of Jupiter.

RAHU AND KETU Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra does not provide deities for Rahu and Ketu, the reason being that Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra names the deities primarily responsible for creating and maintaining the world, a responsibility which does not much befall Rahu and Ketu. Other texts give Adishesha for Rahu and Brahman for Ketu. Rahu – Adishesha Adishesha is the great thousand-headed serpent that couches and canopies the sleeping Vishnu during the dissolution between the different cycles of creation. Shesha means “that which remains,” and refers to the preserved potentialities of creation that, in a suspended state, await expression in the next cycle of creation. Rahu similarly indicates the potentials that the individual is due to experience upon this, their latest birth. During creation, Adishesha supports all spheres of manifestation through the agency of cosmic delusion or Maya. Maya itself consists of each individual’s Avidya, which is represented by Saturn as discussed previously. The relationship of Rahu and Saturn is, therefore, a tightly knit one. Ketu – Brahman Brahman is the Absolute, Unmanifested God beyond creation; “the origin of all knowledge and love, the root of all power and joy.” Brahman rightly presides over Ketu, the producer of liberation, the only Graha who is never satisfied with any love, knowledge, information or happiness that creation, in its many aspects, has to offer. Ketu, as the producer of liberation, represents the death of the individual consciousness so that it may merge with the great consciousness that is Brahman.

They each behave, however, in a more masculine, feminine or neuter manner. Similarly, they each produce male, female or neuter creations. So while all being male deities, the Grahas are responsible for differentiating the qualities of gender. MASCULINE GRAHAS Masculine Grahas are initiating, action-centered and pro active. They feel loved, happy and worthwhile when they are respected and appreciated for what they do, say and think. They find gratification in helping those weaker, more vulnerable or less able than themselves. When they do something beneficial or productive, they feel happy and satisfied.

As all masculine Grahas do, the Sun feels loved and happy when respected for what he says, does and thinks, however, the Sun particularly feels loved when his actions to take care of and provide for others are appreciated. The Sun feels happy when he fulfills his duty to lead and when his lead provides for the betterment of that for which he is responsible. The Sun feels most unhappy when he is unable to lead those he loves and cares for to a better future and when he finds himself unable to fulfill his duties. Mars Mars is very action centered and enjoys activity much more so than the Sun and needs a change of scene more so than does the Sun, so Mars is not quite as steadfast and will more often change his direction upon the advent of a new opportunity to seize. Mars is action centered, so he very much feels loved when his actions are respected. Mars is also the logician, so he also equally feels loved when his ideas are respected. Mars feels most gratified when he helps others overcome problems by his direct assistance. Mars feels most unhappy when he makes mistakes that cause trouble for others. Jupiter Jupiter is the Graha of wisdom and Vacaspati, “the lord of speech.” Jupiter thus feels most appreciated when what he says is respected. Jupiter is most gratified when others respect his teachings and counsel by following them and becoming better through them. For a male Graha, Jupiter is very easygoing; he is the male Graha who has discovered the action-centered path of non-action.

Being the most accepting and forgiving Graha, Jupiter accepts and forgives himself as easily as he does others. Jupiter feels most unhappy when he is unable to provide wise counsel or when he gives counsel that somehow becomes a source of ill to others. FEMININE GRAHAS Feminine Grahas are receptive, discriminative and emotional. They feel loved, happy and worthwhile when they have their feelings respected and when they are appreciated for who they are. They find gratification in being available for good purpose and in taking care of and improving themselves so as to become more self-fulfilled and available for greater purposes. When they feel fulfilled and happy, they live productively and become of benefit to all around them. Feminine Grahas do things when they feel like it and never do things when they don’t feel like it. Their feelings are a guidance system that helps them choose that which they should be doing. Moon The Moon is the most feminine of all Grahas. Though a male divinity like all the Grahas, he is one hundred percent feminine in character, which is shown by him ruling only one Rasi, Cancer, which is a female Rasi. The Moon is the most receptive of the Grahas and has a strong need to bond. The Moon discriminates through feeling, what feels good is accepted and what feels bad is refrained from. The discrimination of the Moon is perfect; it is based upon the Moon’s capacity for inner knowing and not upon desire. If the Moon is poorly situated in the horoscope, then a person will be far removed from their inner knowing and make many confused choices since they will not be able to discriminate effectively.

Venus puts us in touch with our inherent self-worth, which is the measure upon which everything else in our life is evaluated. Venus discriminates by evaluating the worth of all the possible choices available and choosing the most worthwhile avenue. Venus feels happy to the degree of appreciating his own self-worth and when feeling worthwhile, Venus does productive and beneficial deeds. If Venus is afflicted, a person will make poor choices and get involved with things that are not worth their while or which are even destructive. Venus feels most gratified when he is involved in opportunities that are of benefit or desirable for others which at the same time equally benefit himself, they way a marriage should equally benefit both members. Venus feels most unhappy when he feels taken advantage of and when the good he has to offer goes ignored by someone who instead prefers something else; like the way a wife feels hurt when her husband goes to another woman for something she could just as easily provide. NEUTER GRAHAS Neuter Grahas possess an even mix of male and female qualities. These Grahas bring about the activities of the male Grahas when that is what is most suitable or they bring out the receptivity of the female Grahas when it is that which is most suitable.

Mercury Mercury is the great manager amongst the Grahas. He is not a leader like the Sun, he is a manager. His feminine aspect allows him to be receptive to his duties though he is not the creator and initiator of his duties. His masculine aspect takes the actions and initiative that are required to fulfill the duties. He is very directed, creative and initiating once his duties have been pointed out to him. Saturn Saturn is the servant who does all the hard work. Like Mercury, Saturn uses his feminine side to be receptive to his duties.

The Grahas themselves are caused by the Pancha Tattvas as we are told in Surya Siddhanta: “Mars, etc. were produced in succession from Fire, Earth, Ether, Water and Wind.” Surya Siddhanta: 12.24 Thus we have Mars as Fire, Mercury as Earth, Jupiter as Ether, Venus as Water and Saturn as Air. The Pancha Tattvas are themselves created by God and are considered the causal body of Purusha, Purusha being God in his manifested form. Each of the Pancha Tattvas, and, therefore, the Grahas, has its own responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Pancha Tattvas are described by the Srimad Bhagavatam: "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 Graha Sutras “Providing access for the Tattvas, causing exteriors and interiors, and housing Prana, the Indriyas and the individual self are the characteristics of Ether.” Srimad Bhagavatam: 3.26.34 Ether is the space in which creation unfolds and thus Ether provides for the space that the other elements and creation require. By housing Prana, the life force, Ether provides the room for life and for this reason, amongst others, Jupiter is known as Jiva, “life.” “Shaking, displacing, penetrating everywhere, carrying substance of sound, etc. and vitalizing all the Indriyas (sense organs) are the characteristic acts of Air.” Srimad Bhagavatam: 3.26.36 Air shakes and moves things, and so separates and displaces, and is thereby the cause of differentiation (which is completed by the Earth element). Since air shakes, displaces and separates, Saturn rules all shakers, mixers and separators. Air penetrates everywhere and carries the substance of sound, touch, color, taste and smell and thus Saturn rules the radio waves that travel in the air and carry the substance of sound and the light waves that carry the substance of color. Air also carries the substances of all the senses: hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell through its Graha, Saturn, which rules the movement of the life force through the nervous system through which the organs of sense function. In this way, Air vitalizes the sense organs. “Illuminating, ripening, intoxicating, destroying cold, drying, and causing hunger and thirst are the characteristics of Fire.” Srimad Bhagavatam: 3.26.40 Fire causes light and therefore color.

Water causes things to stick together and thus Venus rules glues. Water satiates, maintains Prana and life and increases, and thus Venus rules food.

Mercury is, therefore, very important in all affairs. Earth provides the solidity necessary for things to stand upon each other and the solidity required for one thing to hold another. Mercury therefore rules all foundations. Mercury also rules all jars and anything that is meant to hold another, such as the concrete form made to hold water for a swimming pool. Earth differentiates the Real – the good quality that is the Real becomes differentiated and appears as better in one thing and worse in another.

Air – Saturn – Touch: Acquires knowledge from Tangibility. Fire – Mars – Sight: Acquires knowledge from Colors. Water – Venus – Taste: Acquires knowledge from Savors. Earth – Mercury – Smell: Acquires knowledge from Odors. The five senses are often maligned in spiritual texts due to the tendency for humans to abuse the senses to the point of causing harm. The senses, however, have a higher purpose, that of allowing us to acquire knowledge that is important for our growth and survival, and thus they are known as the Jnanendriyas, “organs of knowledge.” The senses are not only physical organs, but also astral organs, thus it is not only possible to gain knowledge through the physical organs but also through the astral organs. Those that are psychically sensitive regularly rely on their astral organs and may acquire knowledge through clairaudience, palpitation, clairvoyance, a psychic taste or a psychic nose. Hindu texts that deal with spirits even describe the smells of spirits that one with a psychic nose may experience. For a person to have their sight afflicted, Mars must be afflicted. For a person to have a poor sense of smell, Mercury must be afflicted. To be deaf, Jupiter must be afflicted. To have a poor sense of taste, Venus must be afflicted.

It is quite interesting how our speech reflects the relationship between the senses and the Grahas. When something appeals to our wisdom (Jupiter) it “sounds” good. When something is difficult (Saturn) it is described as “hard,” which is a tactual impression. When we have an accident (Mars) we didn’t “see” it coming; and when we are prepared to overcome a difficulty we “saw” it coming. In regards to something that is desirable (Venus) we have good or bad “taste” in music, food and the opposite sex. When our intellect (Mercury) is struggling for understanding, something “smells” funny. FIVE ORGANS OF ACTION Each of the Pancha Tattvas also has an active, or Rajasic, attribute. These are the five powers of action, known as Karmendriyas, “organs of action.” Fire/Mars: Motion – Primary power is in the feet. Earth/Mercury: Excretion – Primary power is in the anus. Ether/Jupiter: Sound – Primary power is in the vocal cords. Water/Venus: Generation – Primary power is in the sexual organs. Air/Saturn: Manual Skill – Primary power is in the hands. Mars is thus responsible for motion which is guided by sight. While the primary organs of motion are the feet, Mars empowers all motion of the body. For a person’s motion to be impaired Mars must be afflicted. Mercury is responsible for excretion which is known by its smell. While the anus is the primary organ of excretion, all organs through which the body excretes what is harmful or unnecessary are empowered by Mercury. For any lack of excretory ability, Mercury, which empowers the excretion, must be afflicted."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Graha Sutras Jupiter is responsible for producing sound, which is produced in the vocal cords. Mercury skillfully and systematically uses the sound created by Jupiter to create speech. For an individual’s vocal cords to be unable to produce sound, Jupiter must be afflicted. However, a person with healthy vocal cords may still have speech defects, which are caused by the affliction of Mercury. Venus is responsible for generation, which is done via the sexual organs. Taste, the sense of Venus, is very important during sexual intercourse. Venus is also responsible for generation as the regeneration of one’s own body, which is done by the Shukra – the vitality of the body. Shukra is the common name of Venus who has the power to bring his disciples back to life and thus Venus’s role in regenerating the body by replacing the dead and dying tissues is revealed. If Venus is afflicted, the vitality of the body is low and one is unable to procreate or to regenerate and rebuild their own body. When this vital energy is depleted the body can no longer be repaired and quickly expires. Saturn is responsible for manual skill which requires a delicate and precise touch and which is most capably found in the hands, though it is not limited to the hands. For an individual to have poor manual dexterity Saturn must be afflicted. Note: The Elements are subtle energies and thus the organs of action are the forces that empower these actions and not the actual body parts through which these things are physically done. Mars, for instance, does not rule the feet; it only rules the power of motion, which is considered to be the most concentrated in the feet. The word Indriya, translated as “organs,” just as well means “power.” FIVE OBJECTS OF THE SENSES Each of the Pancha Tattvas has an obscuring, or Tamasic, attribute, which are the objects of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell – namely sound, tangibility, color, savor and odor. These are known as the Tanmatras.

It is important to understand that the purpose of the senses, the organs of action and the sense objects is to satisfy the desires of the heart. The individual consciousness, represented by the Moon, being unable to experience the whole of the Universe, or God, is naturally awakened to a desire. Upon having a desire, the whole universe musters itself towards the fulfillment of that desire, and upon the fulfillment of that desire, the individual consciousness is pacified and returns to its natural state of peace and joy. In this way the senses, the organs of action and the sense objects satisfy the desires of the heart as they were intended to. The average individual, however, suffers from fear, worry and lack of confidence and is thus unable to attract the fulfillment of their desire from the Universe. Their desire remaining unfulfilled, one desire is immediately followed by another and so the individual consciousness is always perturbed and restless. Due to these many desires and the accompanying restlessness, the individual consciousness cannot attract to itself the fulfillment of the desire and so unhappiness, despondency and eventual ill health result. Upon death, the individual consciousness is full of numerous desires which require that the individual consciousness must be reborn in another body in another life. It becomes, therefore, very important that the individual consciousness is focused upon the obtainment of one desire with full confidence and attention and that one avoid absentminded and inattentive behavior. (Those individuals, however, whose whole minds are absorbed in one thing, may rightly be absentminded in regards to other things.) By being mentally present and focusing on the obtainment of one desire or goal, the individual consciousness will attract from the Universe the fulfillment of the desire and feel peace and then be better able to return to its natural state of peace and joy.

All that is materially created is created via the five elements and thus the five starry Grahas are responsible for producing everything that is experienced. The luminaries, the Sun and Moon, Atma and Manas, are the self and consciousness that do the experiencing. GENERATIVE CYCLE OF THE TATTVAS There are many ways in which the five elements interact, which means that there are many ways in which the five elemental Grahas interact. Understanding these interactions is very important, especially in the context of medical astrology. Ether is the subtlest of the elements and generates Air. From Air comes Fire, from Fire comes Water, and from Water is generated Earth: Ether – Air – Fire – Water – Earth However, this is a cyclical relationship as indicated by the star connecting the elements in the diagram below.

If Venus is weak, a person’s desires are not satiated and so the person becomes lustful for some object of the senses or addicted. This disrupts Mercury, who is less able to experience a sense of accomplishment and whose security is destroyed by the wasteful lust or addiction. If Mercury is weak one will be less able to manage the many details that any accomplishment requires. This disrupts Jupiter, who is unable to focus on a greater purpose because there are too many loose ends to take care of as a result of Mercury’s negligence. If one of the elemental Grahas is particularly robust and strong it will have a beneficial influence upon the elemental Graha that it produces. If Jupiter is particularly healthy, one will have an innate sense of faith and purpose and thus find meaning in all of life’s situations, be they great or small. This will fulfill Saturn and cause Saturn to happily go about doing the many things that it must. If Saturn is particularly healthy, there will be a strong sense of duty and a healthy detachment and fulfillment that prevents any burning need or impatience to fulfill the duty. This will focus Mars in a peaceful and patient manner. If Mars is particularly healthy, a person uses his will power in a balanced fashion and reveals good character in his pursuits. This will increase Venus’s ability to provide internal as well as external fulfillment and thus the person will be much more satiated and comfortable. If Venus is particularly healthy, a person is easily satiated and his senses are thus unperturbed. This empowers Mercury to feel accomplished and successful as all one’s needs are more easily met.

The fact that an element cannot only generate an element but also dissolve that element is important for keeping balance in nature. If Ether only gave Air room to move, the world would have long ago been destroyed by storms, but since Ether also gives wind the space to dissipate, balance is maintained. If Wind could only fan fire, the world would have long ago been consumed in fire, but since Wind can also blow fire out or blow it back upon itself, balance is maintained. If Fire only distilled water, the world would long ago have been drowned, but since fire also evaporates Water, balance is maintained. If Water only cohered into Earth, the world would long ago have been a dead rock, but since Water also dissolves Earth, balance is maintained. This cycle of dissolution is also known as the “Control Cycle” as it controls the balance of things. The Grahas similarly interact to maintain balance. The need for Mercury to establish security and accomplish concrete goals is curbed by Venus’s capacity to feel satiated, or else one could live constantly attempting to accomplish something that is really not necessary. The need for Venus to feel satiated and comfortable is curbed by Mars who finds happiness in developing strength and character through disciplined activity, or else one could live constantly seeking comforts and fulfillment. The need for Mars to be involved in disciplined activity is curbed by Saturn’s ability for detachment, or else one could burn out by constant activity and overtraining. The need for Saturn to fulfill duty is curbed by Jupiter’s ability for forgiveness and understanding or else one would live a rigid life of empty duty. The need for Jupiter to have meaning and purpose is curbed by Mercury’s ability to accomplish a task and find worth in doing so, or else a person could become a fanatic."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 Graha Sutras Also, the need for Jupiter to search for knowledge is curbed by Mercury’s ability to see God manifested in all of creation. EXCESSIVE ELEMENTS The five elements maintain balance but they are not rigid. They are living and interacting. As a result, imbalances often occur for a short time. In fact, the five elements are always imbalanced to some degree, or else life would be static, which is to say that life would not exist. Over all of time, however, their activity is perfectly balanced. Keeping in mind the generating relationship of Ether – Air – Fire – Water – Earth. What would you expect to have happen if there was excess Fire? Air would be consumed to excess and fire itself would run out of Air and be extinguished for lack of fuel. An element taken to excess destroys the very element that generates it, and in so doing, destroys itself. How often do we see those with a great ability taken to extremes become destroyed by that very ability. It is the same principle. Balance is healthy – all else is disease. Similar results happen to the other elements when they are in excess: If there is excess Ether, Earth is destroyed by a vacuum and so Earth is unable to hold the empty space. If there is excess Air, Ether loses its capacity for stillness and Air itself is destroyed in the chaos the same way that radio waves may interfere with each other and cancel each other out. If there is excess Water, fire is extinguished which results in water collecting instead of evaporating in order to fall and flow as is its nature. If there is excess Earth, water is absorbed, there is no erosion and change and Earth loses it property of differentiation. The Grahas may similarly undergo a period of imbalance. If Jupiter is excessive, a person may have unrealistic faith and expectations and as a result Mercury is destroyed and details are not properly taken care of and affairs are managed sloppily. Upon details being mismanaged, no purpose of Jupiter can be furthered."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Five Elements 121 If Saturn is excessive, a person will be to overly concentrated on the performance of their duty or overly dogmatic and miss the whole point, such is the result of the destruction of Jupiter. Upon loosing sight of the goal, one’s Saturnine duties become meaningless. If Mars is excessive a person may be so focused on some disciplined activity or inspired task that they neglect the duties of Saturn. Upon neglecting their duties, one lives as a child and no better character (which is ruled by Mars) is developed. If Venus is excessive, a person may be so concerned with getting nourished, pampered and fulfilled that they are unable to energize themselves for the martial process and climb to success. Upon not being energized to exert oneself, no fulfillment of Venus is possible. If Mercury is excessive, a person can be so focused on establishing stability and material security that they are unable to allow Venus any satiation that requires spending. Upon not becoming satiated, one becomes weak and unhappy and can thus not enjoy or benefit from their Mercurial holdings. A Graha may become excessive when it is joined with Saturn, Rahu or Ketu or when it receives a strong Graha aspect from Saturn. In these cases, the conjunction or Graha aspect from Saumya Grahas will do much to alleviate the excess. DEFICIENT ELEMENTS AND THE INSULTING CYCLE If an excessive element drains its generating element it follows that a deficient element will cause its generating element to become excessive. When a deficient element causes its generating element to become excessive, the generating element will eventually become a source of harm to the deficient element. A deficient element is thus not only harmed by its own weakness, but also by its own generating element. This is known as the “Insulting Cycle.” If Jupiter-ruled Ether is deficient and there is a lack of acceptance and a lack of a higher purpose, then Earth becomes excessive and too much emphasis is placed on material security and accomplishment. Earth will then have an insulting and non-tolerant"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 Graha Sutras attitude towards idealism. If Saturn-ruled Air is deficient and there is a lack of detachment and a resultant fear, then Ether becomes excessive and there will be the tendency to hope rather than to risk doing, to believe rather than risk acting. Ether will then have an insulting and critical attitude towards one’s progress and capacity. If Mars-ruled Fire is deficient, causing one to not be hungry and so exert oneself in such a manner as to progress towards any goal, then Air becomes excessive and indifference and laziness will mark the personality. Air will then have an insulting attitude towards any inspired activity. If Venus-ruled Water is deficient and one is unfulfilled and undernourished, then Mars becomes excessive and very hungry and overly willful. Fire will then have an insulting and non-accepting attitude towards any comforting, relaxing, fulfilling and nourishing activities of Venus. If Mercury-ruled Earth is deficient and there is a lack of material capacity, accomplishment and security, then Venus becomes excessive and the desire for emotional fulfillment, pleasure and comfort becomes excessive to the point of haphazard attempts at emotional fulfillment. Water will then have an insulting attitude towards material success and fulfillment while itself expecting fulfillment in such an ungrounded way that no lasting fulfillment is possible. An elemental Graha most notably becomes deficient when it does not meet its minimum Shad Bala requirement or when it is debilitated or in a great enemy’s or enemy’s Rasi. LIFE-PROMOTING CYCLE The life force is Prana. Ether provides the housing for Prana, which vitalizes the Indriyas via Air, and matures via Fire. This Prana, which is now life, is maintained by Water and cohered into form, which is differentiated via Earth. While Ether provides the housing for the life force, the life force begins its generation of life at Air where it vitalizes the Indriyas. From Air, therefore, begins another important cycle of the elements, what we will call the Life-promoting Cycle, in which Air promotes Water which promotes"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Five Elements 123 Ether which promotes Fire which promotes Earth which promotes Air.

This cycle is very important and basic to medical astrology, but has its ramifications on all other things as well. If Saturn is weak and as a result one is fearful, then Mercury must provide greater material security, consistency and reliability to placate Saturn. If Venus is weak and as a result one is unfulfilled, not satiated and unable to find comfort in difficulties, then Saturn must provide greater detachment and perseverance. If Jupiter is"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 Graha Sutras weak and as a result one is lacking hope or faith, then Venus must provide greater fulfillment and comfort so that one has some happiness as well as greater ease so that difficulties do not tax one’s lack of faith. If Mars is weak and as a result one is slow to exert oneself, then Jupiter must provide greater luck so that things left undone do not become a source of harm as well as greater understanding and contentment with which to accept the difficulties that having an ineffective Mars will sooner or later cause. If Mercury is weak and as a result one is not an effective manager, then Mars will have to provide greater energy and logic with which to combat the difficulties that result from poor management. INTERACTIONS OF THE VARIOUS CYCLES The elements primarily interact in three different ways: Each element generates another element, as shown by the Generative Cycle: Ether generates Air generates Fire generates Water generates Earth. In the reverse these same elements dissolve into each other – Earth is dissolved into Water, Water is dissolved into Fire, Fire is dissolved into Air, and Air is dissolved into Ether. Thirdly, each element promotes the life of another element as shown by the Life-promoting Cycle: Air promotes Water, Water promotes Ether, Ether promotes Fire, and Fire promotes Earth. We have discussed how an afflicted, a weak or an excessive elemental Graha will disrupt or affect other elemental Grahas in accordance with these three cycles. Likewise, emphasizing any element through training, focus of will, gems, diet, etc. will have an effect upon the other elements. Thus emphasizing Water/Venus through the consumption of healthy vitalizing foods will promote the life of Jupiter and one will naturally feel more optimistic and happy. Emphasizing Water/Venus in this way will always generate more Earth/Mercury and so one will manage their affairs more effectively and be more grounded and efficient. Emphasizing Water/Venus in this way will also control Mars through the Dissolution Cycle and thus hunger, anger and excessive passion will be reduced."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Five Elements 125 Emphasizing just one element will thus affect three other elements, so only making slight improvements in life will improve things four-fold.

To determine the strongest of the Grahas for this purpose, examine the Shad Bala. Of the five elemental Grahas, the one with the highest measure of Shad Bala will indicate the dominant element. In addition to an individual’s inherent dominant element, during the Dasa of a Graha, the element of that Graha will increase in the individual. If the Dasa is of the Sun or Moon, neither of which rule an element, the Dasa of the Sun will give rise to Fire and the Dasa of the Moon will give rise to Water. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra then continues to detail the effects of the individual’s dominant element.

They maintain a lean body unless there are other metabolic disturbances. They are also hungry to do, act and perform and though doing more than the average person, they remain hungry to do more and rarely stop to indulge in their successes before venturing forever onwards. They are thus “moving to and fro.” Fire spurs them forwards and thus grants them courage where others may fear or hesitate to go and thus the individual is “heroic.”"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Five Elements 129 Being spurred forwards also causes them to be sharp and poignant in nature. The Fire-dominated individual is very intelligent and knowledgeable, oftentimes surprisingly more so than their haphazard or “to and fro” manner would suggest. Fire, however, is intuitive and logical and so these individuals quickly learn anything that they put their minds to. Being intelligent and fired up, these individuals are strong minded and often opinionated. Fire tends to lighten the complexion and thus these individuals are generally “fair bodied,” and thus more sensitive to the Sun. Having plenty of Fire within themselves, they require less heat and fire from the Sun.

These individuals more easily see the world in a healthy and proper perspective and are thus happy.

Individuals with prominent Ether influence are also fine grammarians. Ether creates an inner happiness from which blooms confidence and assurance as well as the ability to perform difficult tasks without worry. Ether also causes the individual to know proper conduct and to follow the policies necessary to fulfill their duties and activities. From Ether comes all things and thus from Ether also comes the greatest wisdom. The Ether individual is, therefore, wise and, since Ether is expansive, always open to greater wisdom. Ether is space and thus the Ether individual takes up more space and is taller.

Their personality is likewise gentle and affectionate, thus they maintain well their friendships and so have many friends. Water comforts and soothes and thus these individuals are capable of bearing great burdens. Water provides the comfort that allows them to carry great burdens with less strain. Wives, ruled by Venus, are able to bear the greatest burden of all – bearing children. All those things that allow one to carry burdens or bear difficulties more easily are also provided for by Water and thus ruled by Venus. Saddle blankets, cushions, and the shock absorbing soles in running shoes are just a few examples. Water is both receptive and devotional in nature and thus these individuals learn well that which they are drawn towards. Devotion attunes their minds towards those studies which are dear to them, upon which they are receptive to the many truths of that which they study. Water is very important on Earth, a fact which is shown by the Earth being largely covered with water, thus the Water element provides an innate knowledge of the affairs of the Earth.

For the same reason, the Air individual does not hold onto any extra weight and is thus thin in body. Air gets stirred up quickly and thus these individuals are easy to anger. Their anger, however, becomes a source of strength that fuels their ambition and desires. Air element individuals are said to be “difficult to assail.” This is very true. Air element individuals are hardy and tough – disease has a difficult time assailing their bodies. They are survivors and much more difficult to overcome than one would think. Mentally, they are also tough as well as tenacious debaters. Success is a combination of two things: performing great deeds and not being held back. The individuals with the Air element strong do not allow themselves to be held back under any circumstances and thus their successes are more marked and so they are said to be “a lord of the Earth.” "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Five Elements 133 Note: The effects indicated by the dominant element represent some of the individual’s finest qualities. However, the individual will often not be of the exemplary quality described in the Sutras.

So when attributing the qualities of the dominant element to an individual, consider the elemental effects in respect to the horoscope, and thus the person, as a whole. DASA EFFECTS OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS The Five Elements have their ebbs and flows in the individual in accordance with the Dasa influence. The lord of the Dasa will indicate the element that is rising in the individual during any particular time. While the majority of the individual’s characteristics will be indicated by the dominant element, the rising element, in accordance with the Dasa, will significantly influence the individual’s life during that period. The Dasa of the Sun will bring about the rise of the Fire element, the Moon that of the Water element, Rahu that of Saturn’s element, Ketu that of Mars’ element, and the other Grahas the element associated with them.

Instead, they may experience trouble with others, even litigations, and poor planning will lead to stress and financial loss. The period during which the Earth element rises is also the period during which the body is most able to build and store its wealth of health-producing minerals, which brings about the “glossiness of the nails and teeth.” Thus, this is often a period during which one’s diet improves.

The caste system groups people into four different classes: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudra. The Brahmin caste is considered the most evolved, followed by the Kshatriya, Vaishya and finally the Sudra caste. All people are multidimensional, but each person will have dominant qualities that are innate to their individuality and it is due to these dominant characteristics that they are grouped according to a certain caste. Since the origination of this concept, the caste system has become corrupt and dependent upon birth instead of innate nature and has, therefore, been a source of unfairness and social restriction. However, the original idea of the four-caste system is at least as good of a concept as any of the methods of categorizing man that the modern psychologist and sociologists have developed. The Bhagavad Gita gives descriptions of the four castes.

Ultimately the Brahmins’ goal is Moksha – spiritual liberation – as the devoted study of any subject results in the realization that perfect knowledge comes only from God. Those of Brahmin mentality serve society best as teachers, scientists, counselors and authors of philosophical and scientific texts. However, it is the mentality that determines a person’s caste, not the work in which they find themselves. The person whose mind is naturally attracted towards acquiring knowledge and spiritual realization is a person of Brahmin mentality. Spiritually, Brahmins are those who know the Brahman, the absolute aspect of God. The greatest enemy of Brahmins is the pride that having knowledge can result in if it is not pursued with humility. Jupiter and Venus are the two Brahmin Grahas. Jupiter is the spiritual philosopher, the spiritual teacher, spiritual counselor and the author of philosophical texts. Venus is the mundane teacher, the advisor on worldly affairs, the college professor, the scientist and the author of scientific and educational texts. Kshatriyas – Sun and Mars “Valor, radiance, resolute endurance, skillfulness, not fleeing from battle, generosity, and leadership are the natural duties of the Kshatriyas” Bhagavad Gita: 18.43 Kshatriyas are those that have an innate desire to lead, promote ideals and protect their fellow man.

Will is the primary characteristic of Kshatriyas, which not only helps them to lead and protect but, more importantly, helps them to live in accordance with their principles. Spiritually, Kshatriyas are sense-fighters, those who struggle to overcome the desires of the senses. The greatest enemy of Kshatriyas is anger, which is the result of being attached to the results of their duties, so they must learn to fulfill their duties with detachment. The Sun and Mars are the Kshatriya Grahas. The Sun is the leader, politician and promoter of ideals. Mars is the protector, firefighter, soldier and policeman. Vaishyas – Moon and Mercury “Tilling the soil, cattle breeding, and business are the natural duties of the Vaishyas.” Bhagavad Gita: 18.44 Vaishyas are those that have an innate desire to gain or to promote some aspect of themselves while at the same time being of benefit to others. Due to this, Vaishyas take pride in their work or skills and thus do the very best that their ability allows. The Vaishyas’ primary goal is Artha, which translates roughly as gain but also includes fulfilling one’s responsibility towards one’s fellow man. Artha also has the goal of fulfilling one’s desires while learning to control the senses, such as a gentleman of taste and refinement would display. Vaishyas serve society best as businessmen, engineers, craftsman, artists, athletes, doctors, agriculturists, food vendors, office managers, reporters, authors of novels, actors, musicians and all other professions requiring skill. Actors, athletes, artists, musicians and Vaishya-type authors all excel in promoting themselves as unique individuals through their unique skills while providing the benefits of entertainment to their fellow man.

The Vaishya’s active engagement in the world offers plenty of opportunity for this. The danger of Vaishyas is to become caught up in the very interesting world, which they must some day leave, without remembering who is the source and cause of it all. The Moon and Mercury are the Vaishya Grahas. These two Grahas find it important to take care of themselves, but they are both social Grahas and so they also wish to take care of their fellow man or be of benefit or use to their fellow man. Both the Moon and Mercury are doctors, food vendors, agriculturists, authors and journalists. Musicians are ruled by the Moon, which gives them rhythm. Mercury rules businessmen, athletes, artists, craftsmen, managers and actors. Sudras – Saturn “Actions that are of service to others are the natural duty of the Sudras” Bhagavad Gita: 18.44.5 Sudras are those who have an innate desire to fulfill the simple desires of the senses, eating, procreation and the desire for entertainment or those that want the immediate realization of their desires. The Sudras’ primary goal is Kama, which is the desire for and activity of the life of the senses. Sudras differ from Vaishyas in that Vaishyas are educated and knowledgeable about those things that they hope to gain, while the desire of a Sudra is for the raw sense pleasure alone. As an example, a Vaishya with a fondness for alcohol will have knowledge of wines and even have a wine cellar of exotic wines if he can afford it, while the Sudra with a fondness for alcohol will only know the alcohol.

Spiritually, Sudras are body bound and cannot make much spiritual advancement on their own. Their spiritual development comes largely through the company they keep and thus it is a fortunate Sudra who has the company of those wiser and more evolved than himself. The Sudras must be cautious not to waste their life away in oversleeping or idleness that would prevent them from bettering themselves in some manner. In other words, they should make what efforts of self-development that they can, which will usually revolve around physical self-development or the development of any talents that they have. Saturn is the one Sudra Graha. Saturn rules all those who have the simple aptitude of finishing a good day’s work so that they can enjoy the few good things in life. In ancient days, each of these castes was respected, as each caste was important towards creating and sustaining a healthy society. The lowest of the four castes, the Sudras were not considered an undesirable caste. Useless members of society, which were useless due to extreme laziness, bad attitudes, begging mentality, etc., were considered separate, undesirable castes. The four castes, however, worked together to achieve a better society. The higher castes respected the lower castes and understood that it was not many lifetimes ago that they themselves had the mentality of a lower caste and that if they squandered their God-given abilities, they would likely find themselves with a lesser mentality in a future birth. The higher caste accepted members of the lower caste knowing that each was doing the best that they could do with their God-given abilities and God-given innate natures. In time, each individual would evolve until each becomes an enlightened Brahmin. If we were to study modern society in the context of the four caste system, we would quickly realize that most of the problems in today’s society are the result of many involving themselves in roles that are for a higher or lower caste than their innate nature provides. We have Vaishyas in political offices since the modern"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 Graha Sutras method of campaigning requires the politician to be self-promoting, so positions are won through presenting an image rather than earned by one’s service to Dharma. This results in leaders who are not Kshatriyas and not following some principle of Dharma, but instead following the Vaishya duty of self-promotion and gain, and though they attempt to be of benefit to their fellow man, if they do not follow some principle of Dharma, they can never be of true benefit to those they lead. We have Sudras who call themselves artists, a Vaishya role, who sit around waiting for something exciting instead of spending eight hours a day developing their skills. We have Sudras becoming businessmen, engineers and technicians who are not as concerned with the quality of their product or the quality of their work as they are with getting done with work so that they can go enjoy themselves. We have Kshatriyas who are idealistic and want to lead and protect becoming teachers and not having the patience and wisdom with which to accept and properly guide their students, so these “teachers” become angry and frustrated with their jobs. (The person of Brahmin mentality does not get frustrated with his students because he sees God behind everything and realizes there is nothing to achieve in teaching other than to take the action of teaching.) We have Brahmins taking on Vaishya duties, since modern governments and well-to-do Vaishyas do not fund enough religious and scientific projects. The caste is determined by the dominant mentality of a person; any person who is a teacher has some desire for knowledge, but is that his dominant desire? Or is mutual gain the dominant desire? Finally, as a student of astrology, we will even come across Vaishyas trying to be astrologers, who learn astrology as a skill that interested them at some time but who have a much greater desire for gain than for knowledge and spend more time figuring how to promote their business and spend the money they earn through their consultations than they do studying astrology or developing their spiritual practices.

Perhaps if we lived in a society where people accepted themselves and each other, a person would not have the motivation to occupy themselves in some field that there are not truly suited for, and instead keep their minor interests as hobbies. So a Sudra would not have to pretend to be an artist just because they do not feel accepted as a Sudra, instead, they could live a good and productive life as a Sudra. As the concluding chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states: “Better than the well-accomplished duty of another is one’s own duty, even though lacking in merit. He who performs the duty decreed by his inborn nature contracts no sin.” Bhagavad Gita: 18.47 “O’ Offspring of Kunti (Arjuna), one should not abandon one’s inborn duty, even though it has some imperfection, for all undertakings are marred by blemishes, as flame by smoke.” Bhagavad Gita: 18.48 “O’ Offspring of Kunti, shackled by thine own Karma, inborn in thy nature, what through delusion you would not do, though wilt helplessly be compelled to do.” Bhagavad Gita: 18.60 This last Sutra has particular importance in the context of a person maintaining the integrity of the caste innate to their mentality. If a person attempts to operate in the field of a higher caste than their nature makes them fit for, it will only be a matter of time before they are operating at the level that their nature makes them suited for. Thus a person of Vaishya mentality may aspire to gain knowledge and help his fellow man and thus take the profession of a Brahmin, but in time his natural tendencies will preclude that he will think more of promoting his abilities than of developing his knowledge and the service he had hoped to provide to humanity out of his innate love and compassion.

Occasionally, an individual may find themselves at a level of mental development that is almost fifty/fifty; they may be equally suited for two castes. At this point it can be quite difficult for the person to know which path to take. The spirit of surrender, carefully watching one’s mind to see what it is aspiring towards, and a bit of patience will reveal the correct path in these instances. RAHU AND KETU’S CASTE The four castes are all considered important for the healthy maintenance of society.

Chandala means, “the worst,” and refers to those who are of no benefit to society and which are, therefore, only a burden to society. Those who only do ill or cause damage and who are not productive are Chandalas. Individuals who become mentally ill to the point that they can perform no duties or give no love to anyone and those addicts who can likewise perform no duties and give no love are Chandalas."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Caste 149 Ketu is of different castes.

It is always, however, the innate nature that is important and thus Ketu rules those that are equally split in tendencies so that it becomes difficult to find happiness in the field of either caste. Thus Ketu rules those that find it difficult to find their place in the world and they stand out as eccentrics or unusual people in their careers. Those individuals strongly influenced by Ketu find it difficult to fit in the world and must come to terms with themselves if they are to find happiness.

There are three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. SATTVA Sattva literally means “true essence” and alludes to strength of character, wisdom and goodness. Actions that are done with the motivation of strengthening one’s character, the motivation of developing and dispersing wisdom and love, and those actions which are motivated by one’s true nature or inspiration are Sattva. Actions that are performed out of Sattva are those actions which are innate to the individual. Sattva-motivated actions will thus always be inspiring and fulfilling to the individual, come what may in their life. An individual who practices spiritual activities out of love and devotion and not out of fear will always practice spiritual activities, no matter where they find themselves.

Jupiter, the Sun and Moon are the Sattva Grahas."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152 Graha Sutras Jupiter Jupiter is full of knowledge and thus his actions are motivated by the desire to disperse his knowledge. Being full of knowledge, Jupiter reaches for the high things in life while simply accepting the low and difficult things in life. Jupiter is the Graha of purpose and so Jupiter motivates by inspiring meaning in one’s life. The purpose that Jupiter inspires one towards is that which is based on one’s innate and God-given nature and which cannot fail; as compared to those purposes that are motivated by emptiness and lack, which are never fulfilling. If Jupiter is well situated in the horoscope, a person feels an innate sense of purpose; they feel that which they are inspired towards is worth doing and so live life fully. If Jupiter is poorly situated in the horoscope, a person questions if that which they are inspired towards is even worth doing and often doubting their purpose they live life haphazardly or slothfully. Sun The Sun is a noble Graha that causes each person to be the best that they can be. The Sun is the king, or noble leader who is inspired to care for those he loves and thus disperses love the way a leader cares for his people. The Sun is the Atman, the Self, and thus can only motivate a person by the inspiration that comes from their true self. A person with a well-situated Sun in their horoscope is able to follow their inspirations, while a person with a poorly situated Sun in their horoscope doubts their qualities and is thus unable to follow their inspirations. Moon The Moon is, “full of knowing” and a very social Graha that naturally disperses its goodness when opportunity provides. Being a social Graha, it is also motivated by the dispersion of love. The Moon craves being bonded to something greater than itself and is thus drawn towards higher things to which it can attach itself. The Moon is important for following one’s inspirations by being the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Guna 153 imagination that envisions the inspirations. When the Moon is well situated in the horoscope a person is able to maintain the vision of their inspirations and is thus happy and motivated. If the Moon is poorly situated a person is unable to maintain the vision of the great things they hope to do or the great person they hope to become and they thus suffer depression. TAMAS Tamas literally means darkness and alludes to the idea of hell and the negative emotions such as anger, depression and addiction. Actions that are done in order to remove oneself from the many “hells” or sufferings of life or those done to rid oneself of negative emotions are those actions that are motivated by Tamas – by the idea that there is suffering and that there is “darkness” to avoid. If we look at our lives closely we will see that many of the good things that we do are done more to remove ourselves from misery than they are done to create any good, they are in fact motivated by Tamas. Mars and Saturn are the Tamas Grahas that motivate us to overcome the difficulties and ills of the world. Actions that are motivated by Tamas are taken only so long as the ill reason for taking those actions exists. When the ill reasons are no longer present, the action is ceased. When an individual exerts themselves to break down a door to get out of a burning house, their exertions will subside as soon as they find their way to safety. Likewise, if someone pursues their spiritual life out of fear of death, when the fear of death leaves them their spiritual activities will subside. If a relationship is pursued due to inner emptiness, when the inner emptiness is overcome the motivation to have the relationship will subside. Mars Mars represents all those difficulties and troubles that action will resolve. If one is physically threatened, The Tamasic nature of Mars motivates one to overcome or avoid the threat. If failure"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 Graha Sutras threatens, Mars rushes in to avoid the failure. If there is competition and the potential for loss, Mars makes the best effort to win. If one is weak, Mars helps a person develop strength by training and other disciplined actions. In all these examples, Mars is used when there are very tangible problems; however, Mars is constantly being used in similar, though smaller activities throughout the day. Mars is also used in our daily life by identifying problems. All day long we see things that we think are wrong or which should not be. Right or wrong, things are as they are in accordance with God’s design, but our understanding may not allow for them to be acceptable and thus we find a large portion of our lives filled with frustrations over the way things are. The Tamasic nature of Mars inclines him to desire to overcome these things. The normal way in which this is attempted is by changing them, which is a good way if these things are one’s duties, but if they are not, then it is a very poor way indeed. The other way to change these things is to change the understanding of things by allowing for acceptance and by filling the mind with the child like quality of innocence. By doing this we use the presiding deity of Mars, the seven-day-old infant Kartikeya to create peace in our minds. Saturn Saturn rules all of those troubles in life that can never be overcome, but which can only be kept at bay or persevered. Whereas the battles of Mars can be won, Saturn’s are never won; at best they are not lost. One of primary ills of life that cannot be overcome is death; death will come, eventually, to all. Saturn cannot overcome this fact, but, he can adopt simple living habits that promote longevity. If one suffers from losing a beloved, whether to death or to fate, what can be done? Nothing – he or she will never be returned. In this case Saturn helps us to persevere despite the pain of the loss. All people have lost something dear and all have failed in something greatly important. Persevering is one way, regret is the other option, but the best option is to use Saturn’s growth-promoting presiding deity, Vishnu, the absolute aspect of God who"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Guna 155 has manifested himself as everyone and all in creation. Vishnu, through Saturn, helps us be happy with loss. What is one man’s loss is another’s gain, what is the difference? In either case it is Vishnu who gains and Vishnu who loses. A woman can only be loved by one man, what is the difference? Vishnu can only be with her as one man, and whether it is he or I it matters not at all. In this way Saturn provides for true detachment. RAJAS Rajas literally means “mist” and creates the illusion that one is the doer instead of that being done. All actions that are done with the consciousness of, “I am doing...” are those actions that are tinged with Rajas. These actions are “misted” because the person believes that he is the doer of the action instead of realizing that the action actually acts upon him. Due to believing that one is the doer, one becomes passionate – passionately excited about those things that they like to do, passionately angry or upset about those things that they do not want to do, and passionately frustrated or upset when mistakes are made. Rajas tinges all actions, whether actions performed out of inspiration, love, fear, pain, etc. with attachment. Mercury and Venus are the two Rajas Grahas. Mercury Mercury is the Graha that is responsible for manifesting the many things in life and for bringing anything to concrete realization. Mercury does this by ruling the many things that are done to make something happen. For instance, if one wishes to purchase an automobile, one must first travel (Mercury) to the auto dealer. Then one must study the details (Mercury) of the different automobiles. Then one must experiment (Mercury) with the different models by test driving them. Finally, the selling contract (Mercury) is signed and the transaction (Mercury) of purchasing the automobile is complete. So it is in every aspect of life and so Mercury is constantly used throughout the day. The Rajas quality of Mercury"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 Graha Sutras makes us believe that we are doing all of these things, when in fact it is God who is doing all of these things. Because we think that we are doing so much and that we are responsible for so many things to do, we often feel overwhelmed and stressed by our daily lives, especially if Mercury is weak or afflicted. Venus Venus is the Graha of choice that helps us decide what is worth doing. Throughout the day, we make countless decisions, small decisions such as, “Should I go and have lunch now, or should I finish up this bit of work?” Venus decides if having lunch now is a more worthwhile activity or if finishing up the work is a more worthwhile activity. We also make big decisions in life that Venus is equally responsible for, such as, “Should I marry this girl and settle down, or would I be happier taking the job in Europe?” The Rajas quality of Venus makes us believe that we are making all of these decisions and thus we get passionate about them, when in fact, it is God that is making all of these decisions. Rajas is part of every action we take, including those actions motivated by Sattva and Tamas and thus Mercury and Venus are involved in all of our actions. If Sattva prompts us to go to the temple, we still must travel (Mercury) to the temple, and we must still decide (Venus) which temple to attend. If Tamas prompts us to seek medical care for an illness, we must still decide (Venus) which type of treatment to take and then make an appointment (Mercury) to see the doctor or healer. A person becomes spiritually realized upon becoming free from the Gunas, which means to become detached from the desire and need to do uplifting actions (Sattva) and also detached from the desire and need for actions that remove suffering (Tamas). The key to doing this is to become free from Rajas, free from the mentality that one is the doer, upon which an individual becomes detached and a man of non-action, though many great and small things happen in his life. This is, of course, not easy. As always, the cure is"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Guna 157 in the cause and so the Rajas Grahas provide the answer. Through Mercury, whose presiding deity is Vishnu, the absolute aspect of God who has manifested himself as all in creation, one can learn to see God as everything in life. Through Venus, whose presiding deity is Lakshmi, who though able to bestow all worldly gifts she herself only clings with devotion to the chest of Lord Vishnu, one can cultivate love towards God until having no need or desire to make decisions, the same way that one completely in love has no need to make decisions other than that of following the beloved. Note: In respect to all three of the Gunas, the Gunas of the Grahas in no way influence whether a person does a good or bad deed, the Gunas only reveal the motivation for what one does. Many, many ill deeds have been done by those motivated to create a good society (motivated by Sattva) while others have performed many good deeds with the same motivation. Many good deeds have been performed by those motivated to avoid suffering (motivated by Tamas), so also have many bad deeds been done with the same motivation. So it is not the Guna that indicates the quality of what one does, rather it is the high or low behavior that one is operating under that determines one’s deeds. The high or low behavior that one is operating under is astrologically determined by determining the well-being of the Grahas, thus any Graha, whether Sattva, Rajas or Tamas, may be indicative of high or low behavior. IMPORTANCE OF SATTVA GRAHAS There are more Sattva Grahas than there are either Rajas Grahas or Tamas Grahas. This is because the natural state of Man is that of Sattva. The natural state of man is to be an inspired source of love and knowledge. In practice, we find that this is rarely so. The reason it is not so is because of the corruption of Sattva. The three Sattva Grahas: the Sun, Moon and Jupiter all represent important parts of the self. The Sun is self-esteem, the Moon is self-image and Jupiter is self-knowledge. Self-esteem gives strength for"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 Graha Sutras noble actions. Self-image gives the ability to see the true image of oneself in the context of all other things. Self-knowledge gives the intuitive knowing without which no words, no love, no reason, no thought and no purpose feels true. When Sattva becomes corrupted, Man attempts to compensate for his lack and thus performs activities that are troublesome. If the Sun is poorly situated, Sattva becomes corrupted and a person has poor self-esteem which results in their not having the courage to do the noble things that they are inspired to. Feeling like a failure, no concentrated effort is made to better themselves or to provide for others. Instead, one gets attached to the moment’s distraction, pretending it to be important so as to believe they have something worth doing, when in fact, they are not doing what they are inspired to do; thus life has become motivated by Rajas and not by Sattva. Not following one’s inspiration, life becomes toil to be escaped and thus life is motivated by Tamas and not by Sattva. If the Moon is poorly situated, Sattva becomes corrupted and a person has a poor self-image that causes them to see themselves in a worse light than they actually are. Seeing themselves in a poor light, the need to prove oneself arises and one becomes unhappily attached to their actions; thus life is motivated by Rajas and not by Tamas. Seeing themselves in a poor light, they do not believe that they will be taken care of by life and by others and so worry and anxiety arise until life becomes one long battle to avoid trouble and difficulties that are more in the mind than in the environment. Thus life has become motivated by Tamas and not by Sattva. Many difficulties seen in the environment will be the threat of others who may get something that the person themselves desires and thus others become a source of competition rather than a source of love and thus life is motivated by Tamas and not by Sattva. If Jupiter is poorly situated, Sattva becomes corrupted and a person is unable to realize the truth of things. Being unable to realize the truth of things, one cannot fulfill the inspirations of greatest truth, namely realizing and dispersing love and knowledge.

If these Grahas are well-situated in the horoscope, a person does no ill deeds and all afflictions in the horoscope become as naught to them as they will have confidence, proper regard for themselves and proper understanding of themselves. If these Grahas are poorly situated, a person feels empty, insecure and lacking. These ill feelings are at the root of all unhappiness, producing behaviors from selfishness to addictions.

"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Description of the Grahas 161 13 Description of the Grahas Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, as well as most classical astrological texts, provides character descriptions of the Grahas. These descriptions fill out the characters who are the Grahas and provide many of the physical and personality traits of the Grahas. These descriptions provide many of the qualities which the Grahas will bestow upon the individual. PITTA, KAPHA AND VATA As part of the descriptions to be given for the Grahas are their temperaments, whether Pitta, Kapha or Vata. These are important principles that need to be properly understood. Sun – Pitta Moon – Kapha and Vata Mars – Pitta Mercury – mix of Pitta, Kapha and Vata Jupiter – Kapha Venus – Kapha and Vata Saturn – Vata Rahu and Ketu – Vata Pitta is the energy of activity that fuels anything that we actively do and pursue. The more the Pitta, the more a person acts, does, caretakes, provides, etc. There are many things we must do and many things that we want to do, Pitta provides for us to do all of these things. Pitta is equivalent to the Yang of Chinese thought.

Kapha is equivalent to the Yin of Chinese thought. Vata is the energy of movement that provides for change. It is particularly important as the movement between Pitta and Kapha. After activity comes rest. After resting one must act in order to provide for one’s needs. It is Vata that allows for this harmonious interplay of Pitta and Vata. Live is full of change, indeed, change is what makes life. Non-changeability is the property of the non-created, the created is always undergoing some state of change and it is Vata that allows for the change to be harmonious. Vata allows us to make the change from one job to another, to suffer the change of a broken relationship, to relocate and to do all of these things and more harmoniously. If Vata is deranged, a person has fears, worries and other turbid emotions when the natural process of change comes into their life. Vata is the movement that is seen in the popular Yin-Yang symbol that symbolizes the eternal interplay of Yin and Yang. The energies of Pitta, Kapha and Vata may become deranged or excessive in which case they become a Dosha, a “fault” an ill affection. As long as Pitta, Kapha and Vata are harmonious, the mind and body remain strong and healthy. If Pitta, Kapha and Vata become deranged, the mind and body suffer illness and disease. Due to the fact that Pitta, Kapha and Vata become easily deranged, these three are often referred to as the Tri Doshas, “the three faults.” Pitta, Kapha and Vata are necessary to life and healthy living and only when they become deranged are they harmful.

The ability to see the sweetness around him causes the Sun to never harm anything more vulnerable or weaker than himself and causes the Sun to always help that which is in greater need. The Sun is square in build; however, “square” also symbolizes stability and steadfastness. The Sun thus provides for consistency in thought and therefore action and so provides steadfast, committable and reliable behavior. The Sun is the great purifier; it is Agni, the vital fire responsible for purifying the body of toxins and impurities. Psychologically, the Sun is pure in mind and thinks of what it must do and what it is responsible for, instead of what it desires. Spiritually, the Sun represents the pure, untouched nature of the soul. The Sun has a Pitta, or fiery temperament. Pitta makes the Sun physically and materially active, psychologically taking joy in the success his actions bring. Pitta provides intelligence and the Sun’s desire to rely on his intelligence. Pitta causes the Sun to have no need for security, comfort or acceptance, but only for the fair respect its actions merit. Pitta makes the Sun courageous, dynamic and magnetic and enjoying the spirit of competition. Pitta links the Sun to the all-pervading fire that is within everything, which fills the heart of the Sun with boundless energy and enthusiasm with which to support and uphold everything and everyone. The intelligence of the Sun is the left-brained intelligence, the rational and pragmatic intelligence and the intelligence of common sense.

Hair is also the one part of our bodies that does not have any sensory perceptions, and thus the Sun is not very interested in that which he is not perceptive of. Hair does keep a record of our past, in the impurities within it and the subtle markings upon it. Since the Sun has little hair, he is not much interested in the past, but in where he is going. Nor is he hung up or restricted by past events. Spiritually, hair represents the extraneous things that distract from spiritual realizations and the record of our past misdeeds, none of which are of much importance to the spiritually-inspired Sun. “The past is the past,” says the Sun, “all of whose is littered with acts of low nobility.

Psychologically, the pleasant appearance of the Moon indicates the ability of the Moon to see the good in all and to be accepting of what is less than desirable. Spiritually, the favorable appearance of the Moon represents the receptivity capable of attracting the most powerful spiritual inspirations. The Moon is a mix of Vata and Kapha. Vata makes the Moon physically less powerful, but excitable. Kapha makes the Moon emotional, peace loving, forgiving and appreciative of comforts. Kapha physically makes the Moon softer and rounder, and Vata makes the form slender. Spiritually, Kapha promotes a devotional nature in the Moon while the Vata moves the Moon towards spiritual devotions. If the Moon is spiritually sick, Vata will cause endless worries and fears and Kapha will cause deep depressions. The Moon can be seen to fluctuate from day-to-day as it goes through its cycle of waxing and waning. Physically, the fluctuations of the Moon can be seen in women’s bodies, which the Moon strongly influences, as the weight of women’s bodies often fluctuates throughout the month. Psychologically, fluctuations are seen in the emotional changes that are dependent upon the stimulus from others. In a healthy Moon this is not codependent emotional fluctuation, but the Moon harmonizing with the greater whole. Spiritually, the fluctuating nature of the Moon allows adjusting to the constant change of an inconstant world. Whereas the Sun uses his intelligence to follow a rational process in order to arrive at the truth of things, the Moon is filled with knowing and must only look within herself to discover the truth of any matter. That is why the Sun, the king, should always listen to the advice requested from the Moon, his queen, else he will certainly have regret.

Since feminine energy, which the Moon symbolizes, is negative, it is aware of what it does not have and thus yearns for union with something positive, or something that knows what it has and is confident in what it has. This quality makes the Moon very relationship centered. Physically, the lovesick nature of the Moon causes the Moon to desire physical affection. Psychologically, it causes her to desire emotional intimacy, and spiritually it causes her to desire spiritual union. All human souls are, in fact, negative souls that yearn for union with the one positive soul.

Mars is quick to anger; he has things to do and often barrels through it with the force of anger. The anger of Mars is not frustrated and destructive anger, but anger used as fuel with which to succeed in difficult tasks.

The action-centered nature of Mars always results in some physical damage and thus he is of “torn form.” Physically he is otherwise lean in the sense that he burns all that he consumes and does not hold onto extra weight. Like the Sun, Mars has a Pitta temperament and will thus share many of the qualities of the Sun. Mars is also physically and materially active and psychologically takes joy in the success of his actions. Pitta provides Mars with a sharp and logical intelligence. Mars has also no need for comfort or acceptance, finding happiness rather in his successes and attempts.

Kapha makes Mercury receptive to the actions he should take and thus less of an initiator than are the Pitta Sun and Mars. Vata helps him move between action and receptivity so that he acts when necessary while also being receptive to that which may improve his actions. When in a relaxing Kapha state, he is quick to act when opportunity arises. Mercury is quick to make changes and adjustments as required so that his actions will be more precise and effective.

He is tall in height and proportionately large in girth. Jupiter is a blonde, “tawny,” golden yellow haired and eyed.

Jupiter is thus receptive to those things that he is meant to do and then does them, though never initiating from self-interest of any sort those actions which he performs. This makes him a proper channel for God’s work and thus Jupiter is the great Guru amongst the Grahas. The Tao te Ching states that one should, “know the male but keep to the female,” a practice at which Jupiter is very adept. Jupiter is very intelligent and has the capacity not to learn but, more importantly, to understand and is thus “proficient in all Shastras,” for to be proficient in any science requires not that one simply memorize but that one truly understand the subject matter. Jupiter’s capacity to understand comes from the highest part of the brain, the capacity to understand through contemplation.

The eyes are beautiful, watery and devotional. The hair tends to curl and Venus is responsible for providing curly hair. If Venus is influenced by Saturn the curls get even tighter.

Venus is “splendid” in the sense of appearance taking one’s breath away and also in arranging for splendid events that provide happiness to all that may enjoy them. Venus desires to please and is thus civil-mannered and respectful and rightly expects the same honorable treatment in return. Venus is said to be poetical. The poetical ability of Venus, known in Sanskrit as Kavya, is the ability for insight, to see meaning where there is none; to know what happens before it happens. These are all qualities of the great poems, poems laced with deeper meanings and even poems laced with prophecies. Like the other feminine Graha, the Moon, Venus is both Kapha and Vata. Kapha makes Venus peace-loving and appreciative of comforts while Vata makes Venus eager for new experiences. Kapha also allows Venus to be nourished and to recuperate, regenerate and heal. Vata allows Venus to flow with change. Due to the combined effect of Kapha and Vata, Venus is particularly adept at healing from painful and difficult changes and traumas.

All other changes that require letting go and loss are due to Saturn. Saturn is also the Graha that helps us deal with these inevitable changes. Having no Kapha, Saturn is blocked from receiving. Having no Pitta, Saturn is blocked from activating his desires. All Saturn can do is survive. Saturn is said to be “indolent” and so he is not one to pursue ambitions and inspirations, rather he is pushed through life. The need for survival is what gets him up in the mornings. Saturn is the part of us that gets up to struggle, for if we don’t struggle we will fall behind. In this regard he is very important, even in respect to one’s ambitions and inspirations. No inspiration will be reached if one is not willing to struggle. While it is the Sun that gives the inspiration and ambition, it is Saturn who helps us to struggle until we realize the inspiration. Saturn is considered to be lame and as such he represents our weaknesses and our liabilities, whether physical, mental, psychological or financial. Just as a lame man is still able to make a journey, Saturn gives us the capacity to succeed even in the face of our weaknesses and liabilities. It is never a question of whether a person is weak – weakness is in everyone and everyone has liabilities. It is whether we are willing to struggle onward with our weaknesses that is important, and a quality that a good Saturn will provide. Saturn’s coarse hair reveals his animal tendencies, which are nothing more than the instinct to survive, which requires food for personal survival and sex for the survival of the species.

For this reason they create mystery with all that they influence. Rahu and Ketu are also dark, emitting no light, thus their true form is veiled.

The Sun rules bone, the Moon blood, Mars nerves, Mercury skin, Jupiter fat, Venus semen and Saturn rules the sinew. These must not be simply understood as bodily parts or as organs of the body; the Dhatus are much more profound. Each organ and part of the body has all seven Dhatus in its makeup. Some organs have more of one Dhatu than another, but they all have the seven Dhatus as their constituent parts. Sun – Asthi The Sun rules the foundation matter of the body, which is the elemental base of the body. The bones contain the majority of the body’s elements, though all other organs are also composed of elements. There are twenty four essential elements in the body: Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Calcium, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium, Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine, Tin, Silicon and Vanadium. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 Graha Sutras Moon – Rakta The Moon rules the body’s water, which is largely contained as blood. Water is nothing but the predominant molecule in the body, H2O. Thus the Moon actually rules the molecules of the body. Molecules are nothing but a combination of elements – a combination of that which the Sun rules; and thus the Sun and Moon are, as always, inseparable. Here we see the Sun and Moon ruling the body – since the elements and molecules compose the body. Mars – Majja The word used for Mars’s Dhatu is Majja, which means “seated within” and refers to the electricities that are “seated within” everything. The electricities seated within matter become activated upon molecules becoming dissolved by the most important molecule of all, water, upon which ionization takes place. The electricities are most prevalent as nerve impulses in the nerve tissue. Fire is also considered to be seated within everything and the electricities are nothing but fire, the element of which is associated with Mars. Mercury – Tvag The word used for Mercury’s Dhatu is Tvag, which means cover, thus Mercury rules the coverings of the body. This means many things. Each cell has its own covering – the cell membrane. Each organ has its own covering and the body itself has its own covering – the skin, which is itself an organ composed of all seven Dhatus. It is the cover of one type of cell that largely differentiates it from other types of cells. Mercury, through its association of the Earth element, is thus responsible for the differentiation of the body cells. Body cells are differentiated by their protein content, and thus Mercury rules the protein of the body.

Lipids are the nonwater-soluble portions of the body that have two primary functions: that of storing energy and insulating. The energy stored as fats in the body is metabolized by the cells as needed. Lipids not only work to insulate the body from cold as the fat layer under the skin, but also work as electrical insulators within the cells and within the nerves. Without being properly electrically insulated, the body could not operate any better than an electrical device that had all the insulation on the wires removed so that all the wires were touching each other and shorting out. Whether storing energy or insulating energy, lipids house “Prana” which is the duty of the Ether element associated with Jupiter. Venus – Virya Venus rules Virya, which is the genetic material in the body, the nucleic acid DNA. The genetic material is in all cells, though it is of greatest importance in the semen and ovum. This genetic material is responsible for generating all the different cells of the body by determining the different protein structures that differentiate the cells. It will be remembered that generation is the duty of the Water element associated with Venus. Saturn – Snaya Saturn rules Snayu, which is that which binds, namely the connective tissues that hold the body together. On the cellular level, Saturn rules the Ligands which bind to proteins and help determine the many different functions performed by proteins. This is closely related to Mercury’s ruling protein. This is one example, amongst many, of how Mercury and Saturn constantly interact with each other. Another example is how the skin of Mercury also binds the body together, though in a somewhat different way than does the sinew of Saturn.

Everything that exists has within it all seven Dhatus and so it is important to understand the concept of the Dhatus so that one can assign the Grahas to all the other things in the world. For example, a computer is composed of all seven Dhatus. The elements of which the computer is made, largely iron and aluminum and the carbons in plastic are ruled by the Sun. These elements are not found separate, but are in molecular form ruled by the Moon. The Sun and Moon, therefore, rule the body of the computer just as they rule the body of a person. Mars rules the electrical impulses that the computer reads so as to perform all of its calculations, as well as the copper core of the wires and the gold and copper on the circuit boards through which the electrical impulses flow. Jupiter rules the insulation of the wires and the insulators on the circuit boards. Saturn rules all the connectors that attach one circuit to another. Venus rules the operating software on the computer: the operating system and BIOS. Mercury rules the many different installed types of software. If a computer is purchased when the Sun and Moon are afflicted, the body of the computer will one day get damaged. If Mars is afflicted a wire or circuit will be damaged. If Jupiter is afflicted, a circuit will short out due to damaged insulation. If Saturn is afflicted a PCI slot, an electrical plug or some other such connector will get damaged. If Venus is afflicted, the operating system will get corrupted or get erased or the BIOS will become corrupt. If Mercury is afflicted, the installed software will not perform their expected tasks correctly or effectively. In this manner should the Dhatus be understood for all other things as well.

Sun – Residences of Devas Residence of Devas refers to all places of spiritual worship: churches, temples, mosques, pilgrimage spots, etc. Texts on Vastu Shastra, the science of Architecture, do not consider it favorable to live next to temples. The Sun is a cruel Graha and placing ourselves next to him in the form of a temple may be too intense for promoting daily well-being and health. However, if the Sun is influencing a person’s residence, they may well find themselves in the vicinity of a temple.

The basic principle is that the property should be sloping towards the East or North and that any stream or river should be on the right as one faces towards the slope. Within one’s own home, the Moon rules the water-dominated bathroom. Mars – Places of Fire Mars seeks all places of fire and may cause a person to live next to a brick factory, smelter, weapons manufacturing plant, military testing and training ground, cremation ground, etc. Needless to say, these are not ideal places to reside as would be expected since their ruler Mars is a cruel Graha. Even places that have been scourged by fire and that have charcoal remains are ruled by Mars and unfavorable to live next to. Within one’s own residence Mars rules such places as the kitchen where food is cooked, the barbecue, heater, fire place, etc. Mercury – Places of Play and Sport Mercury rules all places of play and sport: baseball fields, cricket fields, play grounds, stadiums, boxing rings, casinos, golf courses, etc. Since Mercury is a Saumya Graha, these places are quite acceptable to live next to.

The fact that they stand on anthills reveals that their foundation is weak and disturbed. These three Grahas all create expectations that have no basis. Saturn creates expectations that some achievement will compensate for a person’s inner lack. Rahu dreams for happiness that never comes and has expectations based on hopes and fears rather than on experience and know how. Ketu has ideas about the way things are that prove inadequate at the most inconvenient times, thereby forcing one through crisis to deepen their insights and understanding. These three Grahas indicate a weak foundation and thus if they are influencing a person’s real-estate they often indicate problems with the real-estate. Oftentimes, especially in the case of Rahu, these problems are unknown at the time of purchase, thus anyone who has these influencing their 4th Bhava or the Karaka of real-estate Mars should be cautious when purchasing real-estate.

True time, known as Kala, is measured astronomically and bears only some semblance to the largely random measurement of time used in the modern calendar. Astronomical measurements of time are very important in astrology. In fact, the earliest Jyotish texts dealt largely with the correct calculation of time. The periods of time ruled by the Grahas are largely used in Prashna astrology for determining when an event will materialize. A study of these periods of time also has much to say about the Grahas. Sun – Ayana Ayana simply means, “Going” and refers to the path of the Sun, more specifically, to the half path of the Sun from solstice to solstice. This is a period of six months and there are two such periods in the year: Uttara Ayana is the period during which the Sun travels from the winter solstice up to the time the Sun reaches the summer solstice, or from approximately December 21st to June 21st – this is the period during which the Sun moves north and the time"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 Graha Sutras when the Sun moves from zero degrees Capricorn to zero degrees Cancer. Dakshina Ayana is the period during which the sun travels south, from summer solstice to winter solstice, or from approximately June 21st to December 21st – the time during which the Sun moves from zero degrees Cancer to zero degrees Capricorn. It is this northern and southern movement of the Sun that is the cause of the seasons, the resultant growth and decay of life on earth, and the evolution of man as well as all other creatures. It is the Sun’s motion that is the consistent motion of the solar system, at least from the point of view of Earth, thus the Sun rules this period as the Sun rules all things that are consistent and all those steady efforts that yield sure results in time. Moon – Kshana Kshana means “Moment” and refers to short moments of time. Astrologically, Kshana refers to what is known as a Muhurta or Tithyamsa, which is one thirtieth of a day, or approximately forty-eight minutes. The Kshana is the shortest period of time ruled by the Grahas and it is the Moon who is suited to rule this period as it is the emotional Moon who lives in the moment. If the Moon is afflicted, then a person worries about the future, but if the Moon well situated, then a person can fully enjoy each moment. Mars – Vara Vara means “turn,” as in a player taking his turn at a game. Vara refers to the turn of each Graha ruling a period from sunrise to sunrise as measured at the ancient astronomically-correct prime meridian at Yamakoti, which lay in ancient days upon the equator at 165 degrees 46 minutes East longitude.

Mercury – Ritu Ritu refers to a period of time that is fixed for some special occasion, in this case, the occasion of the seasons. The six Vedic seasons will be discussed fully in a later chapter, for now it is enough to know that a season is two solar months, approximately 61 days. It is the seasons that differentiate the year, and differentiation is the responsibility of Mercury through his association with the Earth element. Jupiter – Masa Masa is a month, specifically, the lunar month. Masa is in fact another name of the Moon. A lunar month is one synodic cycle of the Moon, the period of one Sun Moon conjunction to another. The lunar month is the important measure for determining religious festivities and for determining auspicious (Jupiter) moments to begin important activities. Venus – Paksha Paksha means, “flank, side, half” and refers to the two halves of the lunar month, the waxing half and the waning half. The waxing half, during which the Moon becomes brighter each day, is known as Shukla Paksha, the “bright half.” The waning half, during which the Moon becomes darker each day, is known as Krishna Paksha, the “dark half.” It is the waning and waxing periods of the Moon that are responsible for the tidal movements, growth of plants and thus generation of life. Venus rules the Paksha since it is Venus who is responsible for generation through his association with the Water Element. The Paksha is equivalent to the fortnight often used in older English literature. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"186 Graha Sutras Saturn – Sama Sama has meanings of equal, same and whole. Sama is the period of a Solar year, which is the period of the two Ayanas mentioned above, thus two equal parts make the whole of the year. The Solar year begins approximately March 21st when the Sun enters Aries. The year is the longest period of time and thus suitably ruled by Saturn, who is the slowest of the Grahas. Also, Saturn rules age, which is measured by the year. RAHU AND KETU Rahu and Ketu do not rule any specific period of astronomical time, those all being ruled by the seven Grahas as mentioned.

Rahu’s allotted period of time is eight months or four Ritus, while Ketu’s is three months or one and a half Ritus.

Rasas, however, is much more than merely taste. The essence of something is in its chemical makeup and thus Rasas more specifically has to do with the chemical essence of something. Taste reveals the essence of something because taste is a sense that is dependent upon chemoreception. The taste buds on the tongue, the palate and the back of the throat are receptive to the chemicals composing a food and thus reveal the essence of the food by its taste. The taste buds themselves, however, are only receptive to five different stimuli; they are not receptive to the pungent or astringent Rasas of the Sun and Saturn. For hundreds of years scientists have recognized four tastes: sweet, salty, sour and bitter. In recent years, scientists have recognized a fifth taste, umami. Taste buds contain receptors for each of these five tastes. Taste buds do not contain receptors for pungency and astringency. These are “tasted” due to their extreme reactions on the skin. The heat of ginger and chilies is felt as readily on the skin of the arm as they are felt on the skin inside the mouth. Astringent substances are felt to cool and tighten the skin wherever they are applied, whether the arm, leg or mouth. So the two Rasas:"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 Graha Sutras pungent and astringent, are not actually tastes, though they very much describe the essence, the Rasa, of a substance. Sun – Pungent The pungent Rasa is not a taste in the true definition of stimulating specific the receptors of the taste buds; rather it is the sensory experience of the heat in a substance. The Sun being hot naturally rules pungent substances. Heat brings things to the surface, diffuses, flares and pushes things out. Moon – Salty The salt taste is dependent upon the receptors that are stimulated by chemical salts, by those substances that contain sodium. Salt is most abundant in the Moon-influenced oceans and thus rules the salty taste. Mars – Bitter The bitter taste is stimulated by a chemically diverse group including alkaloids (such as caffeine, nicotine, and morphine), cocoa and several toxic plant substances. Most other poisonous substances also taste bitter. Bitter substances are largely toxic and have immediate toxic effects or toxic effects if consumed over lengthy periods, such as coffee, black tea and chocolate. Bitter substances often have medicinal qualities and can be of benefit when taken judiciously, but not when taken regularly as food or beverages. Herbalists are often fond of saying, “Good medicine is always bitter.” It is the duty of Mars to protect us, which he does by alerting us to potential toxins through the bitter taste. It is also the duty of Mars to fight the battle for survival, which he does through making us aware of the potential medicinal benefit of many bitter substances. Later it will be discussed how Mars rules those edible, medicinal plants which are bitter. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Rasa - Taste 189 Mercury – Umami (savory) The umami taste is stimulated by glutamate, an amino acid. Glutamate and the umami taste is found in Kombu seaweed, mushrooms, tomatoes, parmesan cheese, cooked onions and meat. Umami does not have a strong, dominating taste of its own, but is a taste that serves best as a base for other tastes and makes all things delicious. Japanese have used Kombu seaweed stock to flavor their dishes. Italians use tomatoes as a base for all their sauces. Indian dishes use tomatoes or onions for their base. The meat eater enjoys the flavors of his condiments which work together with the umami taste of the meat to become delicious. The savor of Parmesan makes everything delicious. The delicious taste of fine wine that is absent from cheap wine is the result of umami, which develops as the wine ages. There is no exact English word to describe the umami taste; the taste is perhaps best conveyed as savory. The umami taste is the taste ruled by Mercury, as it is the taste that mixes and blends other tastes into a savory dish. Without umami, mixing the other strong and distinctive tastes does not result in the same savor and deliciousness. Also, glutamate, which provides the umami taste, is an amino acid, a component of protein and it is Mercury that rules protein as has been discussed in the Sapta Dhatus chapter. Umami taste was discovered in 1907 by Kikunae Ikeda who isolated glutamate as the taste-giving component of Kombu seaweed. This taste has ben synthesized as MSG, which is nothing more than a poor and somewhat toxic replacement for the health promoting Kombu. Though the taste was isolated in 1907, it was only in the year 2000 that the presence of an umami taste receptor was verified by scientist Nirupa Chaudhari and her team. Jupiter – Sweet The sweet taste is dependent upon the receptors in the taste buds being evoked by glucose or by other organic molecules with similar chemical structures such as saccharin and aspartame. Jupiter"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190 Graha Sutras rules the insulin secreting pancreas which is responsible for glucose utilization by the cells and thus rules the sweet taste. Venus – Sour The sour taste is dependent upon the receptors that are stimulated by acids which contain a free hydrogen ion. Hydrogen is the primary component in water, the element associated with Venus. Saturn – Astringent Astringent substances stimulate the skin rather than the taste receptors in the taste buds. The astringent Rasa of Saturn is the very opposite of the pungency of the Sun; it is the sensory experience of cold in a substance. Cold, most notably, constricts. EMOTIONS The idea of the Rasas of the Grahas can be carried over to other things as well. Anything that is hot is ruled by the Sun, anything that is salty is ruled by the Moon, anything that is bitter is ruled by Mars, anything that is sweet is ruled by Jupiter, anything that is sour is ruled by Venus and anything that is constricting is ruled by Saturn. Anything that is balanced is ruled by Mercury. In respect to emotions, the hot emotion of righteousness and the emotional heat of inspiration are ruled by the Sun. Demure emotions and emotions of withdrawal (which pull one inward as salt pulls water into it) are ruled by the Moon. The emotion that is the result of needing to do something undesirable and which “leaves a bitter taste” is ruled by Mars. Also, frustration that turns to bitterness is ruled by Mars. The sweet emotion of happiness is ruled by Jupiter. The sour feeling of being used is ruled by Venus. Sour is also stimulating and thus the feeling of being stimulated is also ruled by Venus. The constrictive feeling of fear that tightens the lungs is ruled by Saturn. Hate, which “chokes” one on the object of their hatred, is also ruled by Saturn. Mercury represents"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Rasa - Taste 191 the balanced emotional state which is the foundation from which we can experience all other emotions. Love that comes from goodness and wisdom that is sweet and brings joy is ruled by Jupiter. Love that is stimulating but which may turn sour is ruled by Venus. SMELL Smell is the other sense that is dependent upon chemoreception. Olfactory glands are stimulated by chemical substances that are air born to the nose. Smell is a much more sensitive sense than is taste, with the nose being capable of discerning countless unique aromas. The unique flavor of foods is largely due to the sense of smell which allows us to enjoy the many different and subtle flavors of food rather than only seven flavors. Since smell is also dependent upon chemoreception, the Rasa, or essence of something can also be determined by its dominant smell. Smells that burn the nose are ruled by the Sun. Salty smells are ruled by the Moon, bitter smells by Mars, savory smells by Mercury, sweet smells by Jupiter, sour smells by Venus and smells that tighten or wrinkle the nose are ruled by Saturn. Though taste and smell are both senses based on chemoreception, the difference between taste and smell is that taste is a property of the Water element ruled by Venus while smell is a property of the Earth element ruled by Mercury. For taste to operate, the chemicals in the food must be in water, a dry tongue cannot taste. Smell directly senses the chemicals.

Fruits are the parts of plants that hold the seeds. Thus Jupiter not only rules all the standard sweet fruits, but also tomatoes, squashes, cucumbers, beans and grains. While Venus rules the actual germ in the seed or bean, the majority of the seed or bean is a storehouse of energy for the germ and is thus ruled by Jupiter.

Mercury likes everything looking like new, but is practical and so does not insist on new things. Mercury takes the best care of that which he owns. The car will be washed, oiled and lubed on schedule. The lawn will be mowed, the house cleaned. Jupiter takes care of things as required, but does not expect them to look or work like new forever. He is happy with what he has as long as it does the job, when it no longer does the job, he replaces it. Venus rules the best in quality of everything. Venus insists on quality. Venus will prefer to have nothing if it cannot have that which is of good quality. Venus knows that paying more for something of good quality is a better investment than buying something cheap and having to replace it over and over again. Saturn likes used things, sometimes to the point of them being practically worthless. Saturn will make something that is worn out and which should be replaced keep on working, no matter how frustrating it may become. As usual, Saturn can persevere, this time with worn out utensils, appliances, tools, vehicles, clothes, etc. "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Ritu – Season 201 20 Ritu - Season É&gae\\›tuvRsNtZc kujÉaNvaeZc ¢I:mk>, cNÔSy v;aR iv}eya zrCcEv twa ivd>. 45. bhågoråturvasantaçca kujabhänvoçca gréñmakaù, candrasya varñä vijïeyäù çaraccaiva tathä vidaù. hemNtae=ip gurae}eRy> zneStu izizrae iÖj, hemanto’pi gurorjïeyaù çanestu çiçiro dvija, “Venus’s Ritu is Vasanta, of Mars and the Sun is Grishma, the Moon’s is Varsha, Mercury’s is Sharad, and, O’ Wise, Hemanta is known to be of Jupiter and Saturn’s is Shishira, O’ Twice Born.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Nature and Form of the Grahas, 45-46 Ritu refers to a period of time that is fixed for some special occasion, in this case, the occasion of the seasons. Six Ritus are acknowledged. Each Ritu lasts two Saura, “solar” months. A Sauru month is thirty degrees of the Sun’s movement in respect to the equinoxes and solstices; it is the same as the tropical month of which the well-known Sun Signs are derived. In fact, the Saura months are known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc. in the Astronomical Siddhantas in exactly the same manner as the Sun Signs. The first Ritu is known as Shishira and starts at the beginning of Uttara Ayana when the Sun crosses the winter solstice (0º tropical Capricorn).

The cycle of the seasons is well illustrated by plant life. Shishira, the Ritu of Saturn, is considered to begin this cycle. During the Ritu of Saturn the life force is concentrated in the roots of plants and many plants are all but dead. The following spring season of Venus, Vasanta, the concentrated life force in the roots springs forth with power and virility as leaves and flowers. The Grishma Ritu of Mars is marked by a battle for available sunlight, space, soil and water – the stronger plants live, the weaker are overshadowed and die or do not fully mature. The Varsha Ritu of the Moon then nourishes the strong plants with an abundance of water so that they may mature and grow to a new and ideally fuller stature in the Sharad Ritu of Mercury. In the Hemanta season ruled by Jupiter the leaves of the trees wither away, change to orange and drop off as the life force of the tree retreats from the leaves into the roots in preparation for the next cycle to begin. A similar cycle happens to the human species as well, which is seen to be apparent in athletes and fitness lovers. During the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 Graha Sutras Hemanta Ritu the glycogen stores of the body can be most effectively increased and so endurance is best developed during this period. During the Shishira Season of Saturn the ability for long and hard efforts is most effectively increased. During the Vasanta Ritu the human body is most capable of gaining strength and power as Venus rules Virya – vitality and strength. The Grishma Ritu of Mars is most effective for developing speed and for reaching high levels of performance. The Varsha Ritu is most suitable for developing one’s innate physical attributes; be it speed, strength, endurance, etc., as the Moon nourishes one’s natural abilities. Sharad Ritu is the period during which maturity is reached as a result of the work done in the previous Ritus and so is not effective for further athletic development. It is rather the period of fruition. Just as ripe fruit on the tree does not benefit from extra water, attempting to force physical improvement during this period is not effective and usually only results in wasted vitality and energy, which can create setbacks, injury and illness. USES OF RITUS The Ritus are used in Prashna astrology to time events and even for finding out the time of birth from the Prashna chart. Furthermore, if a Graha is indicative of ill health, there will be more problems with the health during the Ritu ruled by the Graha. Arthritis sufferers know this when their Saturnine illness becomes more painful in the cold season. Similarly, if a Graha is strong and strengthens the body, the Ritu of the Graha will allow for the rebuilding of the body’s strength. Ritus can also be used for weather forecasting.

The Dhatus of a Graha have many uses. They are used in Prashna to determine whether the concern in the mind of the querist is about an inanimate object, a Dhatu; a plant or plant-derived object, a Mula; or about a person or animal, a Jiva. DHATU – MINERAL KINGDOM Minerals are initially formed by the cooling of the magma that is below the crust of the Earth. Magma is molten slurry containing the mineral-building elements. Magna is thus minerals without form and is thus ruled by the formless Rahu. Occasionally magma is brought to the surface of the Earth by volcanic activity which is, therefore, ruled by Rahu. Hot liquids can hold more dissolved substances than can cool liquids. As magma cools, therefore, it cannot hold as many elements and thus minerals, in the form of crystals, are formed out of the cooling magma. These minerals are known as igneous minerals,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 Graha Sutras which are ruled by Mars. The well-known experiment of sugar crystals demonstrates the process. Sugar is first dissolved in heated water to the point of saturation and a string is suspended in the solution. As the liquid cools it cannot hold all the dissolved sugar and thus sugar crystals begin to grow on the string, to quite large sizes. Quartz and tourmaline are well-known igneous minerals that grow in this manner. Due to the movement of the Earth’s crust, crystals are pressed together under extremely high pressures to form other crystals with completely different properties. These minerals are known as metamorphic minerals, which are ruled by Saturn. Diamond, which is the carbon element pressed at extremely high pressure, is a prime example of a metamorphic mineral. Rock and crystals erode due to wind and especially due to water. The tiny eroded products are brought together by the downward washing of water and upon evaporation and sedimentary pressure form crystals once again. These minerals are known as sedimentary minerals, which are ruled by the Moon. These crystals are generally very tiny and not large like the crystals ruled by Mars or Saturn, though millions of tiny crystals group together to form large crystalline masses. Turquoise and malachite are well-known sedimentary minerals. MULA – PLANT KINGDOM It is an important point that the plant kingdom is labeled as Mula, “root,” as this allows for the plant kingdom to be broken down into two groups depending upon the nature of the root. The firm Sun rules those plants that are rooted to the ground in one fixed place. Venus rules those plants that spread with their help of their roots, such as ferns, creepers, grass and water lilies. The plants with the creeping roots, ruled by Venus, are very important for the generation of life on Earth. Remember, Venus rules generation through its association with the water element.

Each Graha is responsible for producing a few of these important people and is thus known as a Karaka, “producer.” There are two types of Karakas, Sthira, “fixed,” and Chara, “changeable.” A Graha is a Sthira “fixed” Karaka in respect to those people it is inherently responsible for producing and it is responsible for those people in each and every horoscope; its role is fixed. A Graha is also a Chara “changeable” Karaka and represents different people in every horoscope on account of its degrees and so its role in this instance is changeable. It is the Sthira Karakas which are being discussed here. Many of the Sthira Karakas presented by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra are different than those presented by the medieval astrological texts. In all cases, however, the Karakas as given by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra have given better results than those Karakas presented by"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210 Graha Sutras the other texts. Additionally, the other most revered text, Upadesa Sutras, gives the same Karakas as does Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. Sun and Moon The stronger of the Sun or Venus becomes the Karaka of the father and the stronger of the Moon and Mars becomes the Karaka of the mother. The method by which to determine the stronger will be illustrated at the end of the chapter. It may appear odd that Venus, a feminine Graha, could play the role of the father and that Mars, a male Graha, could play the role of the mother. This is because each parent has an active and passive role and it is Venus who plays the passive role of the father while Mars plays the active role for the mother. Both the Sun and Venus bestow qualities dependent upon the father’s influence and both the Moon and Mars bestow qualities dependent upon the mother’s influence. The stronger one, however, represents the dominant influence and when the dominant influence ends, the parent dies. For this reason, these Karakas for the mother and father are important for determining the longevity of the parents and it is primary for that reason that the stronger is taken, even though the weaker also has an influence. The father represents the first exposure to masculine energy in our lives. Masculine energy is the initiating and active energy with which we do. The Sun represents the energy of inspiration which prompts all good actions and which is idealized in the father. This is the father in his active role and has the result of instilling nobility and esteem. Venus represents the genetics contained in the Venus-ruled semen that gears us for specific tasks and gives us the specific abilities, talents and strength with which to do. This is the father in his passive role. The stronger of the two will represent the stronger influence and thus the father. If the Sun is the stronger, a person’s self-development and what they do is more due to the influence of their father’s actions, for better or worse. The father’s actions are responsible for developing the self-confidence with which anything worthwhile can be done."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"People 211 If Venus is the stronger, a person’s self-development and what they do is more genetic, again, for better or worse. If the Sun is well disposed, the person develops a healthy self-esteem as a result of their father’s influence. If Venus is well disposed, the person has strong and healthy genetics. Similarly, the stronger of the Moon or Mars becomes the Karaka of the mother. The mother represents the first exposure to feminine energy in our lives. Feminine energy is receptive, the energy we use to receive what is desirably healthy and to turn away from that which is undesirable or unhealthy. The Moon represents this pure receptive consciousness which is experienced as virtue, patience, tolerance and acceptance in the mother. These are the passive qualities of the mother which provide for a happy childhood, and which instill virtue, peace and a healthy self-image within the child. Mars represents the hardships the mother must bear from pregnancy onwards and thus represents the mother in her active role. First is the growth within the womb. Second is the birth itself; just as Mars is born from the body of the earth, we are born from the body of our mother. Then there are all the Mars-ruled chores that the mother must perform such as preparing food for the child and protecting the child in addition to disciplining the child so that he or she does not do, eat or touch anything dangerous. The mother in her active Mars role is responsible for providing for the physical well-being of the child while also teaching the child about the dangerous things to avoid. In her passive Moon role, she is responsible for providing the internal well-being. As the Moon, the mother trains the consciousness of the child about what is good, while as Mars the mother trains the consciousness of the child about what is ill. If Mars is the stronger, the person’s consciousness develops under the influences of do and don’t, should and shouldn’t and what the mother is able to do for the child. What the mother is able to do for the child begins upon conception for even then the fetus is dependent upon the mother’s physical resources for its"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"212 Graha Sutras nourishment; thus, if Mars is well disposed, the child is physically well provided for from its beginning in the womb onwards. If the Moon is the stronger, the person’s consciousness develops under the influence of comfort, cherishing and acceptance and as the result of the mother’s nature, or as the lack of these things if the Moon is poorly disposed. If the Moon is well disposed, the child develops a healthy self-image and qualities conducive to peace and happiness. The two luminaries, the Sun and Moon, represent the parent’s role in developing the character of the person. It is, therefore, more important that these two are well disposed than it is for Venus and Mars to be well disposed. Venus and Mars represent the parent’s role in what they give to the child, Venus the healthy genetics and Mars the nourishment for the child to grow healthy and strong. Venus as the father is likened to a seed that contains all the genetic material. Mars as the mother is likened to the soil in which the seed is planted. A healthy seed planted in healthy soil yields the strongest plant. In humans however, health is relative to character, so if the Sun and Moon are well situated a persons character gets them through any deficiencies that they may be born with or through any physical lack that they may suffer at an early age.

The elder brother, as will be discussed soon, is not ruled by Mars. It will be noted that the mother is again related to Mars, this is because Mars always rules the mother in the context of the mother as an individual, who she is and what she does.

To clarify this: Jupiter is always responsible for producing the husband and children, but he is especially concerned with doing so if influenced by Venus and Saturn respectively. Venus is the Graha that rules the institution of marriage and thus Venus influencing Jupiter points strongly towards Jupiter as the husband.

The above Sutra comes from an earlier chapter and reflects the same that is stated by Upadesa Sutras under the Karakas. Saturn is thus assigned the elder brother. Saturn produces the elder brother through the 11th Bhava. Elder sisters are considered from Mars as has already been mentioned. In traditional societies the elder brother’s inherited gain was the younger sibling’s loss, and since loss is ruled by Saturn, Saturn takes the role of the elder brother. Additionally, Saturn is the son of the Sun, and so has many similarities to the Sun, who is one of the Karakas of the father. Saturn as the elder brother reveals the many similar responsibilities as that of the father that the elder brother fulfills. Saturn is a neuter Graha and thus some of his influence is on account of the father’s actions (such as the inheritance given to the elder brother) while some of his influence is the result of his self-directed actions (such as how he treats his younger sibling and what he does with the inheritance). While inheritance are not so rigidly structured in today’s cultures, the theme of Saturn as the elder sibling causing loss does hold true. The mother spends much of her patience and ideals upon her first born and thus has less to spare upon her younger children. Younger siblings also want that which the older sibling has, and not getting it, they feel lack, a quality of Saturn.

There are several steps to determine the stronger Rasi: 1. The Rasi with the most Grahas, not including Rahu and Ketu, is the stronger. 2. If both Rasis have the same amount of Grahas, then the Rasi with the Graha in highest dignity is the stronger. Exaltation is the highest dignity, followed by Mulatrikona, Own Rasi, Great Friend’s Rasi, Friend’s Rasi, Neutral’s Rasi, Enemy’s Rasi, Great Enemy’s Rasi and Debilitation. If both Rasis have a Graha in the same high dignity, then check the dignity of the next highest dignified Grahas in the Rasis. 3. If both the Rasis have Grahas in the same dignity, then the dual Rasi is the strongest, followed by the fixed Rasi with moveable Rasis being the least strong. 4. If both the Rasis are moveable, both fixed or both dual, similarly check the strength of the Rasis in which the lords of the Rasis in question are placed. 5. If the lords of both the Rasis are the same strong, the lord with the highest degrees in its Rasi indicates the strongest Rasi. 6. If the lord of the Rasis are the same, the male Rasi is stronger if the lord is in a female Rasi and the female Rasi is stronger if the lord is in a male Rasi. 7. If the Sun and Venus are in the same Rasi, or if the Moon and Mars are in the same Rasi, then the stronger will be the one with higher dignity.

The stronger of the Moon and Mars will most significantly represent the mother.

Mars is in its own Rasi. The moon is in Mercury’s Rasi, who is a great friend of the Moon, thus the Moon is in great friend’s dignity. Own Rasi is a higher dignity than is great friend’s Rasi and so Mars is in higher dignity and stronger and thus the most significant Graha representing the mother. The stronger of the Sun and Venus will indicate the father. The Sun’s Rasi, Pisces, holds two Grahas: Mercury and the Sun. Venus’s Rasi, Aquarius, holds Venus and Ketu, though we do not count Ketu in this matter and thus Aquarius has only one Graha in it that grants it strength.

TAMA “DARK” GRAHAS The two dark Grahas: Rahu and Ketu are Grahas “seizers” in the sense that they seize the native and yoke them to the fruits of their karmas. They are, however, more a type of “Lagna” than they are a planet. The Lagna and the Descendant are themselves the result of the intersection of the horizon plane, which is caused by the surface of the Earth revolving around the axis of the Earth, with the Zodiac. Rahu and Ketu are the result of the intersection of the Moon’s revolution around the Earth with the Zodiac – the Zodiac being the plane of the Earth’s rotation around the Sun. So"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Luminous, Starry and Dark Grahas 221 the Lagna/Descendant and the Rahu/Ketu axis are intersecting points to the Zodiac, one intersecting point is of the revolving horizon, the other of the Moon. The Lagna/Descendant, being the intersection of the Earth’s horizon with the Zodiac, represents the path of the physical body – of physical life and death. The Lagna represents the birth of life, while the 7th represents the exit of life from the body upon death. Rahu and Ketu, being the intersection of the Moon’s revolution with the Zodiac, represent the path of the Jiva, the living being of consciousness symbolized by the Moon. (Remember that the Moon is the Manas, in which resides the Jiva, the living being, along with Ahamkara, the ego, or the idea of separate existence.) Just as the Lagna represents the birth of the physical form, Rahu represents the birth of the individual consciousness – that which draws the individual consciousness forth from the Greater Consciousness. Just as the Descendant or 7th Bhava represents the exit of life from the body, Ketu represents the termination of the individual consciousness – the individual consciousness becoming merged with the Greater Consciousness, and thus Ketu is the Karaka of spiritual liberation. While the Lagna and Descendant represent the path that the physical body must take, Rahu and Ketu represent the path that the conscious self treads. Rahu draws the individual consciousness into its earthly incarnation for the purpose of developing the self in the areas of life indicated by Rahu’s placement. As the self becomes sufficiently developed, Ketu merges the individual consciousness with the Greater Consciousness by withdrawing it from its narrow vision towards a wider and all-encompassing vision that is relevant to the areas of life indicated by Ketu’s placement. The Bhava in which Ketu is placed will, therefore, indicate the manifestation of Spirit which is most relevant to the individual’s experiences. Rahu and Ketu are the path of the conscious self and, since the self is constantly evolving towards greater consciousness, Rahu and Ketu represent the evolutionary path. Since Rahu and Ketu mark different ends of this path, they operate differently, even though"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222 Graha Sutras they are ultimately the same, just as two ends of a stick are essentially the same. Ketu is a very introverted force, and gives completions and liberation. Those things that Ketu is influencing are being completed and resolved in this lifetime. Rahu, on the other hand, propels us into new things, so it appears to be doing the opposite of Ketu. In fact, it propels us into the new in order to create balance where there is imbalance, for as long as there is imbalance there can be no completion or liberation. Even though Rahu is initiating new things into the life, it does so only to create balance where there is imbalance, and not for any reason of those things. The balance Rahu forces us to create is in those areas that are underdeveloped as a result of focusing instead, in recent past lives, on those areas Ketu is influencing. Since the areas affected by Rahu are out of balance and weakly developed, there is generally not the necessary past Karma to easily sustain these things and so much work has to be done in order to develop and maintain them. There is also a lack of knowledge and experience, making it yet more difficult to manage those things influenced by Rahu. Rahu and Ketu are always opposite each other. The law of opposites holds that opposites are the same when taken to their furthest extreme. Rahu and Ketu are, therefore, similar, as Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra states, “Similar is Ketu.” If the area influenced by Rahu is underdeveloped, then the area influenced by Ketu cannot truly be developed either. It is, in fact, only developed from one point of view, and not in a balanced fashion. Without balanced development there can be no fulfillment, nor spiritual consciousness. The balance that Rahu forces us to learn is, therefore, of great importance. For only in involving ourselves in those things that Rahu dictates can we perfect Ketu, which is to become liberated. Though operating differently, Rahu and Ketu are actually working together. Ketu is overly premeditative and self-controlled, sometimes to the point of implosion, while Rahu is lacking discrimination, and chaotic, lacking any control. Rahu creates the chaos that forces Ketu to let go of control and develop flexibility,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Luminous, Starry and Dark Grahas 223 surrender, and detachment instead. The more overly controlled Ketu, the more chaotic will be Rahu. Thus managing Rahu allows for Ketu to experience detachment, acceptance and true peace. Ketu’s placement indicates areas where the native has very strong ideas of should and should not, do and don’t along with the ability to live in accordance with these ideas. Where Rahu is placed, on the other hand, the native has unclear or unrealistic ideas and a lack of ability to live in accordance with any preconceived ideas. Rahu, therefore, serves to cause chaos and instability that serves to free the native from the strong ideas indicated by Ketu and make it impossible for them to live life in accordance with their ideas of should and should not, which if maintained would result in unbalanced development. Both Rahu and Ketu create the need for spiritual comfort and so push one forward, by creating one of three things: 1. Compulsions. 2. Discontent. 3. Radical and uncontrollable changes. These three things manifest as a forth thing: 4. Transformation in the spiritual man, or destruction in the individual with no spiritual focus. The compulsions pull the native into those things required to create balance. The discontent motivates a searching. The radical changes bring to the surface the true individuality of the native, and also free them from attachments that would be binding. More specifically Ketu creates compulsions that destroy or free the native from things. Rahu creates compulsions that pull one into things that they have little knowledge or skill in, and where they are therefore bound to suffer difficulty. Ketu creates discontent due to the old and the familiar. Rahu creates discontent due to the impossibility of anything being as good as the wish; dreams are always better than reality, until of course the world is seen as a dream. Rahu creates"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224 Graha Sutras radical changes that force one to rely on or accept something unfamiliar. Ketu creates radical change to liberate one from attachments, or those things that are completed and therefore have no more purpose in the native’s development. These transformations serve to change the individual’s attitude about something that seems impossible by forcing them to look at it from a higher perspective where it becomes possible. It is this transformation that is most important. Rahu forces the native to have breakthroughs that result in understanding where there was confusion. Ketu transforms things by forcing the native to let go of the ego’s perceptions and attachments, allowing them to see things with a broader perspective. The three forces of Rahu and Ketu: compulsions, discontent, and radical change plague every man. If the individual handles these three with a consciousness of discipline, forbearance and growth, then transformation occurs. If the individual is unable to do this then these serve to destroy the happiness in his life and he is unable to safely tread the path of Rahu and Ketu. If Saturn is well situated in the horoscope, then one will much more effectively handle the dictates of Rahu. If Mars is well situated, then one will much more effectively handle the dictates of Ketu. Always look towards Saturn and Mars to get an idea of how strong the individual is in walking the path of consciousness. Saumya Grahas planetary aspecting Rahu and Ketu indicate an easier and smoother path, while Krura Grahas planetary aspecting make the path so much the more difficult. Rahu’s and Ketu’s Aspects On account of being intersection points just as is the Lagna, Rahu and Ketu do not cause planetary aspects any more than does the Lagna itself. They do, however, have an aspectual influence through the Rasi that they are placed in. The Rasi that is holding Rahu or Ketu is, obviously, colored by the influence of Rahu or Ketu. The Rasi holding Rahu or Ketu will, therefore, quite naturally influence the Rasis it aspects with a Rahu or Ketu coloration."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Forms of the Grahas 225 24 Forms of the Grahas idvakr}aE ivhgSvêpaE srIs&pakaryut> zza»>, purNdracayRistaE iÖpadaE ctu:pdaE Éanusut]majaE. 12. diväkarajïau vihagakharüpau sarésåpäkärayutaù çaçäìkaù, purandaräcäyäryasitau dvipädau catuñpadau mänusutakñamäjau. “The Sun and Mercury possess the form of a bird, possessed of a creeping form is the Moon, Jupiter and Venus are two-footed, four-footed are Saturn and Mars.” Jataka Parijata: 2.12 The forms of the Grahas are very useful for defining things astrologically. For example, animals, as has been discussed, are ruled by Mercury. There are, however, many kinds of animals and after determining from a horoscope that animals are a concern, the next step is determining which type of animal. The forms of the Grahas are the key to doing so. When animals are indicated, the Sun and Mercury indicate a bird. The Moon influencing indicates creeping animals: multi-legged animals, insects and arachnids, as well as snakes which have no legs but which creep forth. Jupiter or Venus influencing indicates a two-footed animal – an ape or monkey, or even a human. Saturn or Mars influencing indicate a four-footed animal such as a horse, cow, cat or dog. The concept of these forms is relevant to other areas of life as well. All types of vehicles, for instance are ruled by Venus. There are, however, many types of vehicles.

Veda simply means knowledge and the four Vedas are generally considered as the oldest of philosophical texts that were passed down orally long before they were ever composed into writing. The four Grahas: Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Mercury each rule one of the Vedas. Jupiter – Rig Veda The Rig Veda, ruled by Jupiter, is by far the oldest composition and largely contains hymns and praises about the different manifestations of God, particularly as manifested in nature as the Sun, Fire, Wind and Water. The Rig Veda is marked by the quality of Awe, the true quality of being in awe of everything as an aspect of God. One who has the quality of Awe has no need for religion, for he already sees God everywhere. It is only when man loses his sense of Awe that he is in need of turning to religion. Venus – Yajur Veda The Yajur Veda is largely a handbook of religious rites. The Yajur is primarily marked by the quality of religion, though it has many similarities to the Rig Veda from which it is derived. Venus rules this Veda that presents the religious rites that strengthen a"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"228 Graha Sutras person’s spiritual foundation because Venus is the Graha that helps us build our spiritual foundation. Venus builds our spiritual foundation by ruling institutions such as marriage and by providing other such rules of conduct that protect us from destroying our spiritual lives. It is only when Venus is afflicted that the ills that destroy a person’s spiritual life come about. As long as Venus is in good condition, it provides the foundation of good behavior and spirituality. Mars – Sama Veda The Sama-Veda is also derived from the Rig Veda and is marked by religious rites much the same as is the Yajur Veda, though it is composed in metre instead of prose, as is the Yajur Veda. Also, the religious rites of the Sama Veda are somewhat different than that of the Yajur Veda in that they are marked more by their quality of helping one taste the essence of God, rather than of building the spiritual foundation, as are the rites in the Yajur Veda. Mars rules the Sama Veda because Mars rules all actions of self-discipline that benefit the character, which the rites of the Sama Veda very much do. Mercury – Artharva Veda The Atharva Veda is unique as compared to the Yajur Veda and Sama Veda in that it is not derived from the Rig Veda. The Atharva Veda contains mantras and prescriptions for appeasing negative forces, gaining mundane favors, improving health, etc. In short, it contains the means for managing one’s practical affairs by esoteric means. It can almost be called a “spell book.” Mercury rules the Atharva Veda because Mercury is the Graha of managing all our mundane concerns.

OTHER SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE The Four Vedas cover any and all areas in life in which a person may wish to make improvement or which they may desire to understand. Other books and sources of learning and knowledge are similarly ruled by these four Grahas. Jupiter rules all those books and sources of knowledge which somehow cause one to think of God and spiritual matters, or which tell the tales of spiritual figures. Venus rules all the sources and self-help books that teach us to understand proper behavior and relationships or which help us to live more healthfully and productively in the world. Mars rules all those books and sources that provide disciplined procedures, training manuals, and step-by-step instructions with which to reach a goal.

Sun and Mars – Upward Looking Upward looking Grahas are ambitious and always envisioning the great things they hope to do in the future. These Grahas appraise what they look at and the measure they use is some respected principle. The Sun looks up towards the responsibilities and duties he is inspired to lead. The Sun measures those he looks at against the principles of honor and esteem.

Mercury looks for opportunities to invest in and possibilities for improvement and efficiency. Venus looks for the best possible choices in all matters. Individuals with prominent side looking Grahas tend to learn best in an auditory manner, which means they need to hear that which they are learning. The also tend to think in sound, which means they hear their thoughts. Saturn and Rahu – Downward Looking Downward looking Grahas more easily lend towards lethargy as when the eyes are directed downwards it naturally brings about sleep. The two downward looking Grahas, Saturn and Rahu, are the two Grahas that create low self-esteem, and so if a person is not looking down due to depression, they are looking down at someone in an effort to think themselves better. Saturn particularly tends to feel depressed and insecure and is thus often attempting to compensate for the ill feelings. When the eyes are directed downwards the mind enters the subconscious, where the fears and fantasies of our psyches lay. Rahu particularly causes us to dwell on our fantasies. These are, however, only the potential negative aspects of the downward looking Grahas. Individuals with prominent downward looking Grahas tend to think tactually, which makes them effective thinkers when what they have to think about is in front of them. Their ability, however, to think about something or mull something over when that thing is not in front of them is low, as it is difficult for their minds to create a picture of the thing that they may wish to think about.

When learning to count, such an individual would learn best touching and moving the blocks as they are counted. When designing, such individuals work well with models to arrive at wonderful designs. The Moon and Jupiter – Looking Everywhere Equally The two Grahas that look everywhere equally see the whole picture. These Grahas are accepting since their thinking is not narrow or confined. They are also capable of deep insights. The Moon is “filled with knowing” and so is very receptive to the truth around him. Jupiter has understanding and so is likewise receptive to the truth around him. Individuals with these Grahas prominent think effectively whether thinking tactilely, visually or in an auditory manner. Ketu Ketu is not given a sight since he does not have a head, being only the tail and trunk of the Asura Svarbhanu. Ketu is the introvert who, not seeing what is happening around him, is less influenced and not so much conditioned by the events taking place in his environment. With this knowledge of the sights and the mental processes it is possible to determine a person’s thought process and a prominent Graha in their makeup.

Mercury and Jupiter are in the middle – not excessively wet or dry. Amongst other things, the dry or wet nature of a Graha will have an influence on the environment in which a person lives. If dry Grahas, for example, are influencing the factors that indicate a person’s residence, the individual will live in a dry clime. If wet Grahas are influencing, a person will life in a humid clime. If Mercury or Jupiter are influencing the clime will be moderate – neither significantly dry nor humid. Dry Grahas influencing the 2nd Bhava or 2nd lord will indicate an appetite for dry food, crunchy foods, toasted foods, etc. Wet Grahas influencing will indicate an appetite for moist foods and juicy foods. Dry Grahas influencing an individual’s body will make the individual lean with a harder and more rugged looking body. Mars especially causes leanness. Wet Grahas create a softer, more resilient and, in respect to woman’s bodies, a more voluptuous body. Even in men’s bodies, wet Grahas add an extra layer of softness.

Jataka Parijata gives similar descriptions while also emphasizing certain aspects of the Graha’s behavior in the above Sutra. The Sun is firm. When the Sun proceeds about his business he is steady and committed. When he says no or draws the line, it is a firm refusal or boundary that cannot be crossed. Additionally, the Sun makes all things firm. Furniture influenced by the Sun, for example, will be firm furniture, rather than soft, plush furniture. The Moon changes, which is to say that he adapts and changes. He will continue as long as what he is doing feels good. When something else feels better, he will do that. When saying no, he only says no to that approach and will easily change his mind if another approach feels good to him. When things become impossible, he will adapt so that they become possible. For this reason the Moon rules evolution, the ability to adapt over time to one’s environment so as to live in harmony with that environment. On account of its adaptable and changeable nature, if the Moon influences something, that object will more readily allow for change."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"240 Graha Sutras Mars digs into things and tackles them; he is fierce and passionate about what he is doing. When he says no, it is a fierce no that if challenged will be met with aggression. On account of his fierce nature, Mars makes all things sharper and more intense. Mars also rules all those fierce things such as knives, weapons and crampons. Mercury is mixed in nature and can act in the fashion of any of the other Grahas. Mercury will first behave in the fashion of any Grahas with which he is joined. If not joined by any Grahas, Mercury’s behavior will lean towards that of the lord of the Rasi in which he is placed, though being capable of behaving in whatever means necessary in order to manifest his agenda. Mercury’s mixed nature makes him very versatile. Jupiter is delicate, kind, benevolent and never pushy or forceful. When he says no it is his kindness that prevents others from crossing the line, as most people are not inclined to hurt or abuse those that are truly good. Jupiter is the great protector whose gentle nature causes him to abstain from harm. Jupiter rules all those things that make other things safe, like the safety switch on a rifle, the safety device on a food processor, or simply smoothed edges on furniture, especially as found on baby furniture. The word used to describe Venus is Laghu, which cannot be easily translated into English. Laghu has connotations of light, quick and easy, thus Venus behaves in a manner that brings things about quickly, easily and efficiently. When Venus says no, he does so gracefully and does not leave anyone’s feelings hurt by his refusal. Venus rules all things that make something lighter, easier, in short, more comfortable, such as padding in a chair and the saddle blanket under a horses saddle. By making things easier and lighter, Venus helps us to bear our burdens. Saturn does things the hard way. His manner is harsh, rugged or even cold. When saying no he is hard or cold.

The knowledge of which grain is ruled by which Graha has many uses, but is perhaps of primary importance for maintaining health, for strengthening the health promoting aspects of the Grahas and for strengthening weak Grahas that are allowing the body to succumb to disease. Whole grains have a lot of vitality, or Virya, which provides them with the ability to grow into a plant. Loss of health is merely the result of a lack of Virya, thus by consuming grains, Virya can be increased. The increase of vital energy that the grain increases is relevant to the Graha which rules the grain. The vital systems and functions ruled by the different Grahas, therefore, can be strengthened through consuming the proper grain. It must be mentioned, however, that for this to be effective the grains must be eaten raw after soaking in water until they soften or until they begin to sprout.

The Fire element on the other hand is drying, which promotes aging, and causing hunger and thirst; thus cooking the grains ruins their health-promoting benefit. Another important benefit of soaking and sprouting the grains is that many grains have toxins in their husks which are washed out during the rinsing process.

Saturn rules the Thymus which is responsible for producing the T-cells which clean up the bacteria that constantly pollute the body. If Saturn cannot maintain the cleanliness of the body in this way, the body succumbs to illness and eventual death. Sesame helps Saturn by destroying the bacteria in the body. Being a seed ruled by a Krura Graha, Sesame is not ideal as a regular and primary food for the body in which event it begins to act as a minor toxin.

This is especially true in the context of eating the grains cooked. In a raw state, it is very difficult to eat an excess amount of any grain. Cooked wheat products are eaten to excess in most cultures, for which reason many individuals are finding themselves becoming allergic to wheat. Cooked Red Dhal and Urd are eaten to excess in India. GRAINS AND ELEMENTS Grains can be advised for consumption based on the five elements. When the Ether element is weak, Chickpea can be taken to increase the healthy mass of the body. When the Air element is weak, Sesame can be taken for its antibacterial properties and thus the body can remain pure instead of building up a high bacteria load, which is a common problem with weak Air. When the Fire element is weak, Red Dhal can be eaten to help energize the body and strengthen its ability to combat difficulties and purge toxins that may otherwise cause disease. When the Water element is weak, Hyacinth can be taken to regenerate and revitalize the body. When the Earth element is weak, Mung bean can be taken to promote nutrient absorption and thereby strengthen a weak and devitalized system. One of the problems of having the Earth element weak is that the body is unable to properly digest the food and so the nutrients are not taken out of the food and though one may eat a lot, their cells are always starving. Mung beans are most easily processed by the body, allowing the body to absorb the badly needed nutrients.

Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra has only little to say in regards to this matter. sIs< rahaenIRlmi[> ketae}Reyae iÖjaeÄm. 42. sésaà rähornélamaëiù ketorjïeyo dvijottama. “Grey from Rahu, black gem from Ketu, O’ Best Twice Born.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Nature and Form of the Grahas, 42 Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra only gives gems for Rahu and Ketu; grey gems are from Rahu and black gems from Ketu. The word used in the Sutra for grey is Sisa meaning “lead.” In Sanskrit, most colors are given by referring to something of the color intended, thus lead means grey, due to lead being grey in color. The word used for black is Niila, literally meaning “dark,” and used to describe any very dark color that is difficult to distinguish from black or black itself. The question naturally arises as to why no colored gems are given for the remaining Grahas. The reason is that color is a property of the Rasis, as mentioned previously, and not Grahas. Rahu and Ketu, however, are associated with grey and black gems due to their being the dark Grahas and due to black not being a color. Black is, rather, absence of color and grey is simply a lighter variation of black. Grey is simply absence of less color than black. This is not to say that the other Grahas are not influenced by gems, but that they are influenced in accordance with the color of the gem in respect to which Rasi rules that color. A Graha is most notably influenced by the color gem represented by its Rasi, exaltation Rasi and Mulatrikona Rasi. The Moon, for example, is"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"248 Graha Sutras significantly influenced by white and pink gems, white being the color of Taurus, which is the Moon’s exaltation and Mulatrikona Rasi, and pink being the color of Cancer, the Moon’s own Rasi. Each Graha is thus actually influenced by two or three different colored gems – one the color of its own Rasi, one the color of its exaltation Rasi and one the color of its Mulatrikona Rasi. While any white gem will influence the Moon, each type of white gem will influence the Moon differently in accordance with its crystal structure, and so it is no simple matter to recommend gems. The exact use and influence of gems to benefit the Grahas is a vast science that requires a separate text to explore, so it will not be discussed further here. The first mention of gems in any available astrological text is in Varaha Mihira’s Brihat Samhita, circa 500 AD. Brihat Samhita mentions twenty-two gems which are stated by the author to bring luck when worn. Nowhere are any of these gems related to the Grahas. The gems mentioned by Varaha Mihira are: diamond, sapphire, emerald, Karka (white), ruby, blood, cat’s-eye, Pulaka, Vimala (stainless), royal gem, quartz crystal, moon-loved (moonstone), Saugandhika (most likely some yellow gem), Gomeda, shell, dark blue (sapphire), topaz, Brahma gem, Jyotirasa (light essence), Sasyaka (perfect), pearl and coral. There is no mention of gems being associated with the Grahas in any available astrological textbook that was written before the 12th century. Some later texts associate one of the precious gems of the time with each Graha. These are the commonly known associations used by many modern astrologers: Sun – ruby; Moon – pearl; Mars – coral; Mercury – Emerald; Jupiter – Topaz; Venus – Diamond; Saturn – Sapphire; Rahu – Gomeda and Ketu – cat’s eye. Associating each of the precious gems with a Graha allowed the astrologer to predict about gemstones. Thus if a noble man at the time was going to gain or lose a gem, the astrologer would be able to predict what type of gem was lost or gained. That is the only"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Gemstones 249 purpose of these associations. In the modern world these associations are not very relevant due to changes in precious gems. These days, pearls and coral have lost their value and are no longer considered precious. Tanzanite, on the other hand, is rapidly gaining favor and has broken into the precious category. These medieval associations have, unfortunately, been misunderstood with the result that astrologers are recommending these gems to strengthen particular Grahas. The method, however, is unscientific and only works at all because, as Varaha Mihira has stated, “gems bring luck when worn,” which means that many random gems will be seen to benefit an individual. These associations are not scientific due to several reasons: The full color spectrum of gems is not covered. The unique crystal structure of each gem is not considered. The unique optical properties of each gem are ignored. Color, crystal structure and optical properties are the differentiating characteristics of gems. These properties result in their being over 7,000 minerals in the earth, many of which are practical to be worn and are thus termed gems. Each of these gems will have a different effect upon the individual, so you can see it is not such a simple matter as “one gem for one Graha,” just as there is not “one herb for one Graha.” If only life were that simple there would be no need for any of us to suffer. Just as many herbs are required to treat all physical afflictions, many gems are required to heal Man’s afflictions. Healing with gemstones is an involved science, no less a science than is the study of herbs. To recommend gems effectively, a serious study is required, a textbook for which is in the works. However, most gems will do something for most people, though the effects may be subtle, so it never hurts to try a gem that an astrologer may recommend out of his intuition or towards which you feel drawn.

This is the first year of life. During this period the child is completly dependent and can do nothing by itself to resist the influence of its environment. At this time the child is as yet unable to walk. Also during this first year the consciousness gets more and more anchored in the body. During this important year the self-consciousness of the child is thus developed in accordance with its environment and in accordance with its physical well-being. If the Moon is well situated in the horoscope, the first year is comfortable, the child is healthy, the body grows to proper proportions and the environment is conducive to the child’s well-being and happiness.

As a result of this, fear, worry and anxiety will more easily invade the mind throughout the remainder of their lives. Mars – Teething, Age 1 to 3 Mars rules the period of teething, from the age of one to three, as well as the period of during which the child learns to walk and run. With the gain of teeth and the ability to walk and run the child can begin to fend for him or herself – they can at least walk or run away from danger and live from regular food that needs to be chewed. Following the develepment of the child’s consciousness through the Moon during the previous two years, the child begins to assert that which is in its consciousness through Mars. This is the difficult period for most parents when the child begins to become a handful; the “terrible twos.” This can likewise be a frustrating period for a child during which they not only suffer the pain of teething, but during which they often feel frustrated with their inabilities. Their consciousness having been developed by the Moon becomes frustrated by their poor coordination, inability to communicate and their inability to be understood. Also during this period the child begins to become able and must therefore learn that which is acceptable behavior and that which is unacceptable. If Mars is well situated in the horoscope, the child shows patience and logically works through that which it is attempting to do. This is the first step in it developing its abilities.

Those responsible for guiding the child will be impatient, be perturbed by the child’s anger and whining and get angry and scold the child in an ill and frustrated tone. The child will rebel, not learn its limits, feel bad and show little desire to do what is acceptable. Mercury – Learning, 3 to 12 Mercury rules the period of learning, skill development and rapidly developing coordination, which correlates to the ages of three to twelve. This is the period during which education should be commenced. It is not considered favorable to begin any structured or formal education before this time, not even the learning of the alphabet. Until the age of Mercury, the child should learn only what it picks up from observing its environment and that which it is able to logically understand though its own motivation. Muhurta texts, in fact, state that education should not begin until the fourth year, allowing the child one year to adjust to the new age. The age of Mercury provides for the development of the child’s skills and interests. Games, athletic sports and education are all important for the child during this period. During this period the child also learns to communicate effectively, not only through speech but also through reading and writing. Since Mercury is the manager, this is also the period of the child learning how to take proper care of themselves and that which they own and to solve problems through the application of their intelligence. The words used in the Sutra to describe Mercury’s age mean, “learning rules/precepts,” and so the age of Mercury is also the age of learning to live by the rules and laws of society.

There will be the tendency to break the conducts and laws of society and problems such as petty thievery, vandalism and various types of dishonesty may be apparent. Venus – Passionate Youth, 12 to 32 Venus rules the passionate age of youth that begins with the onset of puberty and lasts until the following age of recognizing and coming to terms with one’s purpose. During this period, the fulfillment of simple physical and emotional needs is replaced by the need for intimacy and the experience of passion. Most importantly, this is the period during which a person will begin to make decisions that will have life-long ramifications. Decisions such as who they will be with sexually and what type of career for which they will prepare. Physically, upon the onset of puberty, the body begins to rapidly grow stronger until the full physical form of adulthood is reached. This is also the period during which the body is at its strongest. After the age of 32, the strength of the body begins to decline. If Venus is well situated in the horoscope, the indivual makes sound decisions that provide for their betterment and a productive future.

Jupiter – Middle of Productive Life, 32 to 50 Jupiter rules the period of joyfully fullfilling one’s duties, the primary child rearing years and the age of mental maturity during which the individual begins to more realistically see their purpose in the world. The challenges of child rearing and the mental maturity that grows during this period helps one to realize and follow one’s ideals and goals and to walk the path in which one believes. During this period the physical vigor of the body begins to decline and contentment is preferred over excitement, though the mind becomes more active and able.

While doing so, they will enjoy the fullfillment of their other responsiblities, enjoy their children and find happiness in the little things in life.

If the Sun is well situated in the horoscope, this will be a period during which the person finds that what they have done supports who they are and that they can do what they do with honesty and integrity. What they do is, in fact, nothing more than the duty which is born of their innate nature.

Saturn – Old Age, 70 to 120 Saturn rules the period of old age which begins upon the completion of a person’s last great accompishment. This is the age of retirement and the age during which the physical body begins to rapidly decay and during which death has its approach.

Sun There are several different version of the parentage of the Sun, the most common version holds that the Sun is an Aditya, a child of the goddess of unbounded space, Aditi, and her husband the great Rishi Kashyapa. This would make the Sun the brother of Indra, with who he is held in equal esteem. Surya, the Sun, had several wives, the most important of who is Samjna, “Consciousness,” the daughter of Tvastri, the Divine Architect. The fact that the Sun is wedded to Consciousness reveals that the Sun is the indicator of the consciousness that helps us be true and noble. When we misbehave, the Sun, through his wife Consciousness, lets us know. Samjna gave three children to the Sun: Manu Vaivasvata, Yama and his twin sister Yami. The Sun was so bright, however, that Samjna could not withstand his brilliance and so she had her serving maid, Chaya, “Shadow” take her guise and placed her with the Sun while she herself took the form of a mare and retired to the forests to devote herself to spiritual practices. The Sun thus had three children with Chaya: Manu Suvarni, Saturn and Tapati. Eventually the Sun found out about the deceit and went to Samjna’s father, the Divine Architect who explained to him why his daughter had left him. Being a helpful father-in-law, he then shaved off the Sun’s rays so that he would not be so bright as to repulse his wife. (For this reason it is said that it is inauspicious to portray the Sun"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"264 Graha Sutras with strong rays.) The Sun then went and found Samjna, who had taken the form of a mare, in the forest. Upon finding her, the Sun himself took upon the form of a horse and they copulated as horses, from which the two great horsemen, the twin Asvins, were born as well as Revanta. Of the Sun’s children, Manu Vaivasvata is the ancestor and law-giver of the human race, Yami attempted to seduce her twin brother Yama and then became a deity of the night while Yama became the God of Death and the Lord of Dharma. Manu Suvarni will be the next ancestor and law-giver in the next Manvantara (secondary cycle of creation of which there are fourteen). Tapati married King Samvarana and bore Kuru, the ancestor of the Kauravas, the Solar dynasty of whom Lord Rama was to be born. The two Asvins (Dasra “giving marvelous help” and Nasatya “not untrue”) became the Divine Physicians. Revanta “wealthy” came in charge of the Guhyakas who guard Kubera’s (the God of Wealth) treasury. Moon There are different stories about the birth of the Moon. One story has it that the Moon is the child of the Sapta Rishi Atri “The Eater” and his wife Anasuya “Free from Envy.” The fact that the Moon’s mother is “Free from Envy” is important as this quality is a quality that marks the Moon. If the Moon is afflicted a person needs to work on this quality and will often find that they are jealous and envious. If the Moon is well situated a person is inclined to mind their own business and enjoy their own lives while allowing others to enjoy theirs without interfering. Another story has it that the Moon was born out of the eye of Atri. This story certainly has some symbolic value for the Moon is the sense mind – the strongest senses which are sight and taste. Taste is the most difficult sense to control; if an individual can control their desire for taste, they can manage all the other desires that stem from the other senses easily, even the sexual desire. The importance of sight is demonstrated in the English language where"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Myths and Families of the Grahas 265 we “see how this feels,” “see how this sounds,” “see how this tastes,” rather than “feel how this feels,” or “listen how this sounds” or “taste how this tastes.” Thus sight is the sense that Man most relies upon. The Moon is the Casanova of the Grahas, possessing twenty-seven consorts. These twenty-seven consorts are the twenty-seven Nakshatras. The Nakshatras are the daughters of Daksha “The Skillful” and his wife Asikni “Black,” who are also the parents of Sati, Siva’s wife, thus the Moon is the brother-in-law of Siva. It is on account of his many wives that the Moon is said to wax and wane. The Moon favored Rohini above his other wives and so his father-in-law cursed him that he would be childless and die of consumption. The Moon’s wives were saddened by this and so pleaded with their father to free the Moon from his curse. The curse was thus modified to be periodical instead of permanent and thus the Moon wanes with consumption each month. The Moon has had no children with any of his twenty-seven wives. He did, however, have an illegitimate child with Jupiter’s wife, Tara “Star.” It seems that the Moon was not satisfied with his twenty-seven Nakshatra stars and thus had also to forcibly carry off Jupiter’s Tara. The illegitimate child that was born from the union of the Moon and Tara was none other than the Graha Mercury. Mercury went on to father one of India’s two great dynasties, the Lunar Dynasty, of which Krishna and Arjuna, Yudhishthira and the other Pandus of Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita fame where born. Mercury is a friend of the Moon and tries his best to help his father, though the Moon is an enemy of Mercury and only tries to break Mercury down. It seems that the Moon is no better a father than he is a husband. If the Moon is overly prominent while the Sun is underdeveloped in a man’s horoscope, the individual will similarly put his own feelings before that of his wife and children and thus fail in his duties as a husband and father. "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"266 Graha Sutras Mars Mars is unique in that he has no father, only a mother, for he was born out of the Earth herself. The fact that Mars has no father reveals that Mars does things his way. Not having a father, he does not have the guiding influence and role model that a father normally serves. Rather, he follows his sense of logic and arrives at conclusions that are his own. Additionally, the lack of a father makes him hungry to define who he is and thus he is desirous to develop his character. Only having a mother, however, reveals that the foundation of Mars logic and desire to develop character is based on an individual’s emotional security. Insecure emotions will hamper the proper use of logic and also cause an individual to illogically develop their character – by changing others and other things rather than themselves. Being the son of the Earth, Mars is ideally equipped to handle the many challenges, difficulties, dangers and threats that are a normal part of life on Earth. All creatures struggle to survive, to eat and to thrive; those with a solid Mars in their horoscopes are not only best equipped to do so, but most enjoy the daily fight. Mars not only has no father, he also remains unmarried and has no consort. He is the Bhramachari, the celibate student who focuses on moving forward and becoming better rather than on pleasures and conveniences. With no father and no consort, Mars is his own person, follows his own mind, and enjoys independence, though he freely gives his allegiance to the king or path that he finds noble and honorable. Mercury Mercury, as mentioned, is the illegitimate child of the Moon and Tara due to a forced union. For this reason, illegitimate children are indicated in an individual’s horoscope when the Moon and Mercury are appropriately influencing. Mercury married Ida, one of the most interesting figures of Vedic Mythology. Ida is the personification of the drinks and milk offered at sacrifices and symbolizes all forms of refreshments"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Myths and Families of the Grahas 267 offered to the deities, including the refreshment of praise. Ida is the granddaughter of the Sun and the daughter of Manu. Ida’s birth is also interesting. Ida’s father wanted a boy and thus performed a ritual in order to have a son, but made a mistake in the ritual and thus ended up producing a daughter. Upon growing up, Ida became a man due to the favor of two powerful divinities, Mitra and Varuna. Ida’s stint as a man did not last long, however, for he trespassed on Parvati’s sacred grove upon which no man may tread and thus Ida once again became female. It is in this second female form that Ida was married to Mercury. Mercury and Ida had a son, Pururavas, who fathered the Lunar Dynasty. After giving Mercury a son, Ida once again became male through the beneficence of Vishnu and went on to father three of his own children. For this reason, Mercury is the Graha that indicates a propensity for homosexuality. Mercury’s son, Pururavas, was a great king who ruled all the seven continents. Pururavas fell in love with the celestial nymph Urvasi, who was not only a celestial nymph, but the most beautiful and talented celestial nymph and the favorite of Indra. It is with this nymph that Pururavas fathered the Lunar Dynasty. Jupiter Jupiter is the child of Angiras, a sage born from the mouth of Brahma, who was an esteemed writer of astronomy. Angiras had four wives: Smriti “memory,” Sraddha “faith,” Svadha “oblation,” and Sati “truth.” Jupiter embodies all of these qualities and habits due to being raised by these four divine mothers. Jupiter’s consort is Tara, who is the mother of the Graha Mercury as discussed above. Jupiter and Tara had a son, Kaca, “hair,” who once upon a time seduced the beautiful daughter of Venus. Jupiter and Venus have always warred against each other, with Venus generally being the cheated loser. It would be a happily-ending fairy tale to say that Jupiter’s and Venus’s children could fall in love and live happily ever after, but such was not the case."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268 Graha Sutras Jupiter’s son only seduced Venus’s daughter for his and his father’s own purpose. Once their purpose was fulfilled, Jupiter’s son immediately disposed of Venus’s daughter, though Venus’s daughter loved him dearly. There are similar stories of how Jupiter lied in order to overcome Venus and his disciples the Asuras. Jupiter and his son often so resort to base means in order to bring about the destiny that is meant to be brought about. Venus and his daughter always live righteously, always do the best possible thing, which is all anyone can do, but destiny often overrules and in the end we must accept what the gods dictate. Jupiter gives the wisdom and insight to recognize this greater destiny and thus have peace and happiness whatever befalls one, whether what befalls one is fair or not. Venus, on the other hand, chooses the best and most honorable path possible, never lying, never cheating and never seeking to further his desires at the expense of others. Unfortunately, this does not always mean that things work out as fate is ever in the background. When it does not work out, Venus gives the ability to heal and regenerate from the pain of disappointment. Venus Venus is the son of Bhrigu who was one of the greatest astrologers. Bhrigu also possessed the gift of prophecy to a high degree and had a very insightful mind. For this reason, Venus also has prophetic ability. Venus had a daughter, Devayani, “The Way to the Gods,” who fell in love with Jupiter’s son as discussed previously. Upon the end of her short-lived romance, Jupiter’s son cursed her so that she would marry beneath her status and thus she married a king instead of a Brahmin. Her eventual husband was very libidinous and so cheated on her, due to no fault of her own. Devayani did thus not have great luck with men; however, she is the ancestor of Lord Krishna for her son, Yadu, is the progenitor of Krishna’s clan. Devayani symbolizes the ability to bear burdens without become ill-mannered or hateful, but to continue onward as best as one is able."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Myths and Families of the Grahas 269 This is “The Path to the Gods” and a quality given by the Graha Venus. Saturn Saturn is, as mentioned previously, the son of the Sun and his wife’s duplicate, Chaya “Shadow.” The Sun’s wife is Samjna “Consciousness” but Saturn is the son of Shadow. These two consorts of the Sun indicate the two parts of the self, the conscious and subconscious or shadow. Saturn is born out of the subconscious. For this reason Saturn indicates all the subconscious fears and habits which cause us pain, suffering, setbacks, delays and trouble. Saturn is, however, still the son of the great king, the Sun, so he is no lesser of a being. In fact, the Sun and Saturn always operate together; they are “opposite ends of the same stick.” Where the Sun is the ambition and confidence that uplifts us, Saturn is the ability to overcome the weaknesses which may hold us back, between the two of them we become able make a success of our lives. Saturn has no consort, and like Mars remains alone. His reasons for being alone are very different than are those of Mars. Mars prefers to remain unmarried because he cherishes independence for action. Saturn prefers to remain unmarried because he is a brooding loner who finds no happiness in company. These two cruel Grahas serve to get us through the difficulties and hardships of life and are not suited to a life of comfort and security that a married man enjoys. Rahu and Ketu The birth of Rahu and Ketu during the churning of the ocean has been explained already under the myth of Kurma Avatara. The Asura who became Rahu and Ketu was Svarbhanu, who was the child of Vipracitta “Sagacious” and Simhika, a daughter of Daksha and thus a sister to the Moon’s wives, the Nakshatras. Rahu and Ketu are, therefore, cousins of Mercury, not in blood but through"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"270 Graha Sutras Marriage. Rahu, Ketu and Mercury get along well, as cousins should, while all sharing enmity from the Moon. The very birth of Svarbhanu from such illustrious parents indicates that amongst Asuras, he was one of the great ones, for which reason only he was able to maintain his senses in the face of Mohini’s charms and thereby partake of the Amrita. On a symbolic level, Svarbhanu probably represents the lighted (Bhanu) space (Svar) surrounding the earth. The lighted space is the space through which the light of the two heavenly lights, the Sun and Moon, pass through as the light travels to Earth. The intersection of these two lighted paths is Rahu and Ketu. These intersection points, which are Rahu and Ketu, of the Sun’s path with the path of the Moon are illustrated below.

Different languages have different vowels and even vary in vowel number; regardless, all vowels are ruled by the Sun.

The more the mouth is open the more power the sound has. Between the Sun and Saturn the Grahas in their natural order rule sounds that are formed with the mouth becoming more and more closed until at Saturn the mouth is entirely closed. While it may at first appear that the mouth is opened when pronouncing Saturn sounds, the mouth is actually kept closed until the pronunciation of the Sun-ruled vowel sound following the Saturn sound.

Mathematics is the universal language, so it is very worthwhile to make a numerical study of the Grahas as well. NUMBERS OF THE GRAHAS Each Graha represents a particular number, which indicates the fundamental nature of the Graha: Sun 1 Moon 2 Mars 3 Mercury 4 Jupiter 5 Venus 6 Saturn 7 Rahu 8 Ketu 9 This is the order in which the Grahas are normally listed. GEOMETRY In order to understand the meaning of the numbers, each number can be described with the aid of geometric forms. Understanding the numbers in this manner will assist in understanding the Grahas. One – Sun The One is geometrically symbolized simply by a single point. It is the essential component part of all other forms and numbers and"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"276 Graha Sutras so of greatest importance. As the essential component part it represents the root element from which all has its source. One represents the beginning and initiation of all forms. As the integral part of all other forms, the One also represents completion and fulfillment on any level. Beginnings, and initiations, are primary keywords for One, while completion and fulfillment may be taken as secondary due to the One being integral to all other numbers. All these are qualities of the Sun. Two – Moon Two is geometrically symbolized by a straight line, which is the form derived from two points. Between the two ends of the line there is always a center point, a point of balance. One end of the line is on the left, the other on the right; or one is above and the other is below. Two therefore represents duality; yin and yang, male and female, positive and negative, etc. The energy of the two is one of contrasting, but interactive forces, as the two points, though opposite, are joined. Any influence to one affects the other. If we extend one end of the line, then the middle point shifts as well, the line has changed but balance is maintained. This is also shown by the yin/yang symbol of duality, where the forces are in constant flux and change, but always balanced. Balance is a primary keyword for the Two. Contrasting though interactive, one affecting the other, and change that is based upon maintaining balance, are also keys to the Two. All these are qualities of the Moon. Three – Mars The Three is symbolized geometrically by an equal lateral triangle; fig. 3-1. For the first time we have a figure that encloses a space; tangibility and form now manifest. This is not a form of stability or stagnation, but rather, as the triangle symbolizes, a form of energy."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 277 3-1 Attaching a similar triangle to each edge of the original triangle creates a similar, but larger, triangle; fig. 3-2.

The whole figure is one of expansion. 3.3 Growth, expansion, and energy are keywords of the Three, keeping in mind that growth and expansion are both due to energy. Growth and expansion that are the result of applied energy are qualities of Mars. Four – Mercury Four is symbolized by a square; fig. 4-1.

This attainment creates stability. 4.2 Extending the edges of the original square; once again a cross is formed. This cross is somewhat different than the proceeding cross as its four arms extend infinitely; fig. 4-3. 4.3 This form also gives a sense of growth, like the Three, but in a slower, more stable and consistent manner. The growth of the Three is due to energy and gives expansion, while the growth of the Four is for reasons of security, the desire to maintain stability."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 279 A final geometric exercise, which was not possible with the triangle of the Three, is to connect the angles within the form as fig. 4-4. Again a cross is formed symbolizing attainment and stability, but in the inside of the square and thus the Four also represents inner security, which is the result of experiencing concrete security. 4.4 Stability and attainment are primary keywords for the Four and, therefore, Mercury, while security, both inner and outer, can be taken as a secondary keyword. Five – Jupiter Five is symbolized by a pentacle; fig. 5-1. The interior angles of the pentacle measure 108 degrees, a number symbolizing fulfillment. 5.1 Connecting the inner angles of the Pentacle creates a five-pointed star; a pentagram; fig. 5-2, inner star.

It is noticed, however, that there is an element of open space between each “petal” which can never be filled by a pentacle. There is therefore a noticeable lack in the sense that it is no longer possible to build upon the structure of the Five; there is a lack of constructive potential. This lack at some point in time causes one to turn away from the fulfillment of the Five in order to grow, but this turning away is often not one of choice. Changes, therefore, may come that force this; or stated another way, grace is not always easy. 5.4 Fulfillment, luck and grace, are primary keywords of the Five and, therefore, Jupiter, while lack of constructive potential leading to needed change may be taken as secondary keys."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 281 Six – Venus Six is geometrically symbolized by a hexagon; fig 6-1.

Notice that the six inner triangles are of the exact size of the six external triangles. Only in the Six do we have such an example of balanced harmony. The outer fully reflects the inner.

The strong connection between the Three and the Six, which will be demonstrated numerically soon, is shown. Harmony, efficiency, and improvement are keywords for the Six and Venus. Past experiences and events influencing the present events, and also events generally reflecting one’s inner state are all indicated by Six and Venus. Seven – Saturn Seven is represented by a heptagon; fig. 7-1. 7.1 Attaching similar forms to each edge of the original heptagon creates the form in Fig. 7-2.

Notice that the outer star is formed by the same sized and shaped triangles as are surrounding the inner star; the inner desires that are lacking external fulfillment are represented by the points of the outer seven-pointed star. This discontent is the natural result of the consciousness being separated from Spirit. The seven-pointed star is a symbol of the discontent that motivates the search and striving that is one’s only hope when one finds that their world is unable to satisfy, ideally this is a spiritual search. This search results in change of some sort. Change, searching, striving, all the result of the inner not being matched by the outer are qualities of the Seven and Saturn. Eight – Rahu Eight is geometrically symbolized by an octagon; fig. 8-1. 8.1 Attaching similar octagons to each edge of a center octagon creates fig. 8-2.

One of these squares or crosses, however, is not stabilized as it is on edge. The Eight is, therefore, indicative of creating stability, attainment and security, where there is none, but through the use of what one has that is stable, attained and secure. A harmony, or balance, needs to be created between what is stable, attained and secure, and that which is not.

What is stable, attained and secure has become so through the expense of that which is not.

It will be noticed that the Eight is the most difficult of all numbers to explain, the most confusing as it were. This is the nature of the Eight, the area of imbalance is always one of confusion as focus has not been put there until now; the focus has instead been on what has been attained. Power, confusion, unbalance and creating balance are keywords for the Eight and Rahu. Nine – Ketu Nine is geometrically symbolized by a nonagon; fig. 9-1. 9.1 Attaching similar nonagons to each edge of the original nonagon yields fig. 9-2.

All that is manifested is the Four, which has its reflection in the world as good and evil, right and wrong, the qualities differentiated through the knowledge given by Jupiter, the Five. Having the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong given by Jupiter, one must interact with the concrete world indicated by Mercury. This is done through the agency of the Six, the Graha Venus. Venus evaluates and makes the choices. Venus is"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 293 a friend of Mercury and a neutral of Jupiter, thus Venus understands that all of the concrete world is a manifestation (Mercury) of Spirit/consciousness, and is not circumscribed by the right and wrong of Jupiter. Venus chooses to do not what is right or good, knowing that both are an aspect of Spirit/consciousness, but to choose what it finds most worthwhile. Venus does this with the knowledge that everything has a price and that the price must be considered when making the choice. (For this reason Venus is a friend with Saturn, the Graha that exerts the payment, and the Graha that follows Venus.) Since the knowledge of “good” and “evil” represented by Jupiter reflects the price that one has to pay for any choice, Venus does not go against the grain of Jupiter, nor though does he care for Jupiter’s dictates. Venus follows his own dictates of healthy evaluation which provide for the same path as Jupiter’s dictates of right and wrong. Being part of the material creation, making choices to do what one finds worthwhile while being constrained by the dictates of good and evil, results in lack, which is indicated by the Seven, Saturn. The three things, Mercury/Four, Jupiter/Five and Venus/Six manifest as the fourth thing, Saturn/Seven. Lack, the quality of Saturn, results from making choices in the world due to two reasons: Each choice requires that something else is left behind, the left behind thus becomes a source of lack. Ill choices result in paying more for something than it is worth and this payment may take the form of debts or the undesirable fruits of past ill Karma. On the level of lack and experiencing the effects of ill choices, Saturn has his reflection as Rahu, and thus it is said, “Rahu gives the effects of Saturn.” The lacks, debts and fruits of ill Karmas represented by Saturn are reflected in the individual’s life through Rahu. All that can be done with these things is bear them until their timely completion. This completion is represented by the final Graha Ketu. "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"294 Graha Sutras NUMERICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE GRAHAS So far we have studied each Graha as a singular number, each Graha, however, has many facets, which are revealed by manipulating the numbers. Addition One manner in which numbers may be manipulated is to add up all the numbers containing a number. Two, for instance, contains both 1 and 2. Adding up 1+2 results in 3, thus the number Two, and thus the Moon, also embody the quality of Three. In the event that addition results in a two or larger digit number, the individual digits are to be added together to reduce the number to a single digit. This is known as numerical reduction. Performing the exercise for all the numbers yields the following: 1/Sun 1 = 1 2/Moon 1+2 = 3 3/Mars 1+2+3 = 6 4/Mercury 1+2+3+4 = 10 = 1 5/Jupiter 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 = 6 6/Venus 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21 = 3 7/Saturn 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28 = 10 = 1 8/Rahu 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36 = 9 9/Ketu 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45 = 9 Square Root The square root of a number reveals its foundation.

Each number has a square, which in most cases must be reduced: 1/Sun 1 Squared = 1 2/Moon 2 Squared = 4 3/Mars 3 Squared = 9 4/Mercury 4 Squared = 16 = 7 5/Jupiter 5 Squared = 25 = 7 6/Venus 6 Squared = 36 = 9 7/Saturn 7 Squared = 49 = 13 = 4 8/Rahu 8 Squared = 64 = 10 = 1 9/Ketu 9 Squared = 81 = 9 The additions, square roots and squares of all the numbers are shown in the diagram below. The study of the numerical diagram has much to offer. First notice that the addition of all the numbers One, Four and Seven yield One, the number of beginnings and initiations. These three, the One, Four and Seven, each initiate the beginning in their respective levels: The One initiates the level of Consciousness, The Four initiates the level of Materialization and the Seven initiates the third level, which is the result of Consciousness manifesting itself as Creation – the level of lack and growth of consciousness.

On the first level, the level of Consciousness, the addition of all the numbers in the Two/Moon yields the following number Three. This reveals that the moment that the One Creative Spirit symbolized by the Sun is reflected as the many individual consciousnesses symbolized by the Moon, these two begin to interact, the number Three. A similar thing happens in the other two levels. In the level of Materialization, the addition of Five/Jupiter yields Six/Venus, thus the minute a difference of quality and goodness is understood through Jupiter, one begins to"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 297 make choices through Venus. On the third level of Lack, the addition of Eight/Rahu yields Nine/Ketu - the moment that the individual begins to experience the effects of past Karmas, they begin to move towards greater consciousness. Mathematically, the One/Sun is unique in that it not only is the One, but its addition, square root and square are also One, thus the Sun is changeless and symbolizes the soul. Ketu is similar to the Sun, but a bit different. Ketu is Nine, its addition yields Nine and its Square yields Nine, so it is also changeless and thus represents the liberated consciousness. The important difference is that Nine’s/Ketu’s source is Three, which is shown by its square root. Thus the foundation of the changeless liberated consciousness indicated by Ketu is in the individual character indicated by Mars. The square of Two/Moon is Four/Mercury, revealing that the birth of the individual consciousness, the Moon, yields concrete manifestation, Mercury. Due to the square of Two being Four, Mercury is considered the son of the Moon. The square of Three/Mars is Nine/Ketu, revealing that the character indicated by Mars will generate a liberated consciousness. It also supports the astrological dictum that Ketu gives the effects of Mars. The square of Six/Venus also yields Nine/Ketu, revealing that the devotion and good decision making of Venus results in completion and liberation. Both Mars and Venus are thus mathematically seen to be important for the spiritual life. The square of Four/Mercury is Seven/Saturn, revealing that the result of material manifestation is invariably lack and disappointment. Further, the square of Seven/Saturn is Four/Mercury, revealing that the result of lack and disappointment is either further efforts towards material manifestation or acceptance that comes from realizing that all that is manifest is an aspect of Vishnu. For this reason Saturn and Mercury, according to Jaimini’s Upadesah Sutras, make one a Vishnu devotee. The fact that Mercury squared equals Saturn"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"298 Graha Sutras and that Saturn squared equals Mercury has another important revelation. Mercury is the lungs and Saturn the movement of Prana from the brain through the nerve endings into the senses. As long as the breath is flowing, Prana moves towards the senses and the illusion of creation is maintained. The squares of these two Grahas’ numbers being each other’s numbers reveals a vicious cycle of bondage which can only be broken by the scientific Yogic methods of stopping the breath. The square of Five/Jupiter yields Seven/Saturn, revealing that the knowledge of good and evil understood through Jupiter produces the capacity for Saturnine duty and though the performance of duty always has an element of lack, the happiness and idealism of Jupiter allows one to enjoy their duties since they realize it is the best choice. The best choice being shown by the fact that the addition of Five/Jupiter is Six/Venus. In this way the mathematical relationships of the Grahas should be studied. This table has much to reveal, the more it is studied the more you will understand the Grahas. What I have written is only a small bit of what can be gleaned from its study. GRAHAS AND NUMBERS RULED In addition to each Graha being a particular number, each Graha also rules a number: Sun 1 Moon 2 Mars 9 Mercury 5 Jupiter 3 Venus 6 Saturn 8 Rahu 4 Ketu 7 "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Grahas and Numbers 299 The Sun, Moon and Venus each rule the number that each symbolizes.

The actions of Mars have one purpose – deep, indestructible security – Ketu, which ultimately is liberation. Ketu means flag, a flag being a symbol placed upon secured territory. The security gained by Ketu is used to overcome any other fears and lacks indicated by Saturn.

The concrete success and the resources gained through success provide the foundation for great purposes, Jupiter. The concrete success of Mercury is not necessarily concrete in the sense of worldly articles, it can be a concrete spiritual experience that was gained through focusing one’s consciousness and upon gaining that concrete experience the spiritual aspirant has a greater spiritual foundation with which to impel their spiritual life. What I have written is just one example of how these six Grahas interact. They interact in this way in all matters. Looking for and studying these interactions will deepen your understanding of the Grahas. While these six Grahas are operating in a cyclic manner, the Sun, Moon and Venus provide for the stable foundation of the individual. The Sun provides self-esteem and the capacity to perform with confidence. Without self-esteem, all actions are lackluster. The Moon provides for a healthy self-image. Without a healthy self-image, an individual will not be able to accept him or herself. An individual who cannot accept him or herself can also not accept the world and the good things that are offered, even the good spiritual things that are offered. Venus provides for self-worth. Self-worth is the measure used to evaluate the opportunities presented by life. If one’s self-worth is low, then one cannot evaluate their opportunities healthfully and will thus make poor and even debilitating choices in life. Thus these three Grahas maintain the health of the individual. If a Graha is weak, but its ruling Graha strong, then the ruling Graha can compensate for the other Graha’s weakness. Similarly, if a Graha is strong, but its ruling Graha weak, then the ruling Graha will disrupt the naturally favorable qualities of the Graha that it rules. If Mars, for example, is afflicted, there will be a tendency towards quarrelling. A well-disposed Jupiter, however, will provide for a more contented spirit and forgiving nature, which will reduce the tendency towards quarrelling."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Relationships of the Grahas 301 36 Relationships of the Grahas Grahas may have an affinity, disregard or no regard for each other and as thus treat each other with friendship, enmity or neutrality. First, Grahas will treat each other with friendship, enmity or neutrality on account of their innate qualities and this is known as the Natural Relationships of the Grahas. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra gives the rule for determining the natural relationships of the Grahas. iÇkae[at!

The Sun rules the 11th from Libra and since the 11th, Leo, is not one of the 2nd, 12th, 4th, 8th, 5th or 9th or the lord of Venus’s exaltation Rasi, the Sun is inimical towards Venus. Jupiter is the lord of the 3rd and 6th from Venus’s Mulatrikona Rasi, which is Libra. Neither the 3rd or 6th is a friendly position, but the 6th, which is Pisces, is the exaltation Rasi of Venus and thus Jupiter becomes friendly on account of ruling Pisces, but inimical on account of ruling the 3rd, and so Jupiter is neutral towards Venus.

The question naturally arises as to why the 2nd, 12th, 4th, 8th, 5th and 9th from the Graha’s Mulatrikona are significant for establishing friendship. The importance of the Mulatrikona Rasi as the foundation of a Graha’s qualities will be discussed in the next chapter. For now, just keep in mind that a Graha is energized by its Mulatrikona Rasi. Just like the Grahas, the Rasis interact in many ways; they are not independent. The capacity of a Rasi is dependent not only upon itself, but also upon certain other Rasis, particularly those next to it (the 2nd and 12th), those in trine to it (the 5th and 9th) and the 4th and 8th, which have a special capacity to secure and stabilize a Rasi. Rasis support the Rasi that they are the 2nd, 12th, 4th, 8th, 5th and 9th from, and, by extension, support the Graha that has its Mulatrikona there.

A Graha in Niica, “low” has a very low capacity to fulfill its responsibilities. The student, however, must be careful not to jump to simple conclusions and assume that exalted Grahas are always favorable to the native and debilitated Grahas always unfavorable. An exalted Graha in the horoscope will certainly be favorable for that which the Graha Rules, but it may harm other indications in the chart.Similarly, a debilitated Graha will be unfavorable for that which it rules, but due to less attention being focused on what the Graharules, the indivudal may develop other things to greater fulfillment.Life is a give and take, and nothing in the horoscope makes a Graha great for every single thing.

The unique qualities of each Graha stem from the Graha’s Mulatrikona Rasi. As you learn about the Rasis you will see that many qualities of a Graha are directly related to its Mulatrikona Rasi. A Graha placed in Mulatrikona is very strong, in fact most strong, in its innate nature. Exaltation is a higher dignity, which means that the Graha operates in a higher manner in exaltation, but a Graha’s inherent qualities are most powerful when it is in its Mulatrikona. On account of their Mulatrikona being in the same Rasi as their exaltation, the Moon and Mercury are unique in respect to their exaltations and debilitations in that they do not have a full Rasi of exaltation and debilitation. The Moon is exalted only in the first three degrees of Taurus and has its debilitation for only the first three degrees of Scorpio. Mercury is exalted in the first fifteen degrees of Virgo and debilitated for only the first fifteen degrees of Pisces.

A Graha also gains dignity on account of being placed in the Rasi that it rules. The dignity of a Graha placed in the portion of its Rasi that is not its Mulatrikona portion is own Rasi. The dignity of a Graha being in any other Rasi that it rules is also own Rasi.

A Graha is, however, in auspicious dignity more often than in inauspicious dignity. This means that one inauspicious Graha can ruin the effects of several auspicious Grahas. Life is seen to be that way – many people have several good qualities, only to have one bad quality ruin all that is good in their life. If the auspicious points are totaled for all the auspicious dignities in the Rasi one arrives at 172 (60+45+30+22+15 = 172). If the inauspicious points are totaled for all the inauspicious dignities in the Rasi one arrives at 174 (56+58+60). Thus, the auspicious and inauspicious values are relatively equal and there is roughly a 50/50 spread in auspicious and inauspicious values in the average horoscope. RAHU AND KETU AND DIGNITY Classical texts on Vedic Astrology are not in agreement as to the dignities of Rahu and Ketu. Some texts grant them exaltation, debilitation and Mulatrikona Rasis, others do not. The texts that do"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"312 Graha Sutras provide their exaltation, debilitation and Mulatrikona differ as to their opinions. In the chapter on the Grahas in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, nothing is said in respect to Rahu’s and Ketu’s dignities. In one of the Dasa chapters in the second volume, however, Rahu and Ketu are given exaltation, Mulatrikona and own Rasis. There are several signs of corruption in these later chapters and I am of the opinion that the Sutras giving Rahu and Ketu’s dignities are not original statements of Parashara but rather additions. During the recompilation of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, several Sutras were unfortunately added to the work that have no place therein. This is due to the difficulty of ascertaining authorship when compiling fragmented manuscripts. My experience inclines me to believe that attempting to use dignities for Rahu and Ketu only leads to error and that it is better to follow the dictum that Rahu and Ketu give the effects of their lords. Thus Rahu and Ketu will behave with the dignity in which their lord is placed. If Rahu and Ketu did indeed have dignities, we would expect the different texts to at least agree on the dignities as they agree upon the dignities of all the other Grahas. The very fact that they disagree points to Rahu and Ketu’s dignities being manufactured by different astrological authors in their attempts to deduce the dignities of Rahu and Ketu from their experience and that these dignities are in fact not part of the unalterable laws of astrology. The simple fact is that Rahu and Ketu are not like the embodied Grahas, as has been discussed in the chapter Luminous, Starry and Dark Grahas.

Vedic astrology recognizes two types of aspects: one based on the Rasi that the Graha occupies and another based on the inherent nature of the Graha. The above Sutra gives the aspects that are based upon the Rasi that the Graha occupies. These aspects are clarified below.

The texts from the Siddhanta period before the age of Christ such as Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Upadesa Sutras and the ancient Vriddha Karikas that were written by the ancient masters and of which only fragments remain all teach Rasi Drishtis. Rasi Drishtis, however, have been ignored in the astrological texts written during the past 2,000 years, the dark age of astrology and all other sciences. We fortunately live during the time of astrology’s renaissance and now the two ancient texts Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Upadesa Sutras are again widely available and being studied. The result is the reintroduction of Rasi Drishtis. There are two types of aspects in Vedic Astrology: Rasi Drishti and Graha Drishti. In order to practice astrology fully, both types of aspects are necessary.

(Graha Drishtis in comparison, as will be discussed in the next chapter, are almost always in effect, but to different degrees.) Since Rasi Drishtis are either “on” or “off,” they are to be used in all cases where a definitive, concrete aspect is required. The basic rule as to when to use Rasi Drishti is that whenever a Graha is being considered to make something concrete happen or to tie something together through its aspect, then it is its Rasi Drishti that is to be used. For instance, the Lagna lord in or aspecting the 7th Bhava will involve the native in relationships – for this the Rasi aspect of the Lagna lord is the aspect to consider. Additionally, Rasi Drishti is to be used when using Rasi type Dasas. Example: In the Rasi Drishti chart, the Lagna is Virgo, a dual Rasi. Grahas in the other dual Rasis, namely the Moon, Mercury and the Sun, will Rasi aspect the Lagna. Similarly, the Moon Rasi aspects the Sun and Mercury, which Rasi aspect is returned by the Sun and Mercury. Mars, in the moveable Rasi Aries will aspect the fixed Rasis other than fixed Rasi next to it, which is Taurus. Mars, therefore, aspects Rahu in Leo, Saturn in Scorpio and Ketu in Aquarius. Rahu, Saturn and Ketu return the Rasi aspect to Mars, since a fixed Rasi aspects the moveable Rasis, except for the moveable Rasi next to it. Jupiter in Taurus, a fixed Rasi, aspects the moveable Rasis, except for the moveable Rasi next to it. Jupiter thus aspects Venus in Capricorn, Libra and Cancer.

The word Sphuta, means “correct,” and refers to the exact placement of a Graha. In other words, the Graha’s exact ecliptic longitude down to its degree, minute and second. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra states that these aspects are based on the longitude of the Grahas, in contrast to the Rasi-dependent aspects explained earlier.

Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra then goes on to provide the precise calculations necessary to use these aspects. Before continuing with the actual calculations of the aspects, it is necessary to understand that the full strength of a Graha aspect is measured as one Rupa and that one Rupa is equal to 60 Virupas. The Grahas, therefore, aspect other Grahas and points in the horoscope to the strength of 0 – 60 Virupas. Also, these aspects are not mutual, one Graha may aspect another without being aspected in return. Additionally, in order to understand the meaning of the Sutras giving the calculations, one must understand a bit about ancient mathematics. In the ancient system of Vedic mathematics arc measurements were always given in Rasis and degrees of Rasis. In fact the term Rasi is used to signify thirty degrees of a circle and has in fact nothing to do with stars or any other celestial phenomenon, it only has to do with a circle. In ancient times an arc of sixty-six degrees would be called two Rasis and six degrees. This is the convention followed in all astronomical texts and used in all astrological calculations. The ancient Greeks followed this very same convention. In these Sutras, therefore, one Rasi means thirty degrees, two Rasis sixty degrees, three Rasis ninety degrees, etc. ASPECTS OF THE SUN, MOON, MERCURY AND VENUS This first group of Sutras gives the calculations for the aspects of the Sun, Moon, Mercury and Venus. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, on account of their special full strength aspects, have special considerations that are given next. Calculating these aspects can be painful for those that do not cherishers mathematics, however, tables are provided at the end of the chapter to simplify the process, besides which, if you look at horoscopes regularly, you will surely have an astrological program that will do the job of calculating aspects for you.

The calculation for the fourth Rasi is correct, but the calculation for the eighth Rasi would end Jupiter’s aspect at 270 degrees instead of 300 degrees, which is abnormal as all Grahas end their aspect at 300 degrees. I recommend the following corrected calculation instead: In the eighth (240 degrees), 30 minus the excess degrees is multiplied by 1.5 and added to 15. Example: For Jupiter’s fourth aspect, to calculate the aspect of Jupiter upon Venus in a horoscope with Jupiter at 5 degrees of Cancer and Venus at 10 degrees of Scorpio, the difference from Jupiter to Venus is 125 degrees. 125 degrees is 5 degrees more than the fourth Rasi, the 5 degrees are doubled and subtracted from 60 to reveal an aspectual value of 50 Virupas. For Jupiter’s eighth aspect, following the calculation as given by myself, in a horoscope with Jupiter at 5 degrees of Cancer and Venus at 10 degrees of Pisces, the difference from Jupiter to Venus is 245 degrees. 245 degrees is 5 degrees in excess of Rasis, the 5 degrees are subtracted from 30 yielding 25 degrees which are multiplied by 1.5 to yield 37.5, which added to 15 reveals an aspectual value of 52.5 Virupas. Diagramming the results of the above Sutra yields the following view of the aspects of Jupiter (note: the dotted line would be the result of the corrupt calculation as given in the Sutra): "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Graha Drishti 329 Aspects of Jupiter Full3/41/21/460 45 30 15 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360  @v< rVyaidoeqana< S)uqa d ̄iò> àjayte, tÖzadev Éavana< jatkSy )l< bdet!. 13. evaà ravyädikheöänäà sphuöä dåñöiù prajäyate, tadvaçädeva bhävänäà jätakasya phalaà vadet. “So the Sun’s and other planets’ exact aspect is determined, according to which the effects of the Bhavas of the horoscope are told.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Narration of Graha Sphuta Drishti, 13 In conclusion Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra makes it quite clear that it is these exact aspects that are to be used for judging the horoscope. These aspects can be a bit tedious to perform so the common practice is to consider only the full aspects and that based only on Rasis, not on degrees as specified by Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. For example, if a Graha were in Aries it would be considered to aspect any Graha in the 7th Rasi, Libra, no matter the degree. In actual practice it is possible for a Graha to be in the last degree of Aries aspecting a Graha in the first degree of Libra. The difference from the aspecting Graha to the aspected Graha would then be 152 degrees. At 150 degrees an aspect has zero strength, so to consider this 152 degree aspect as full is not accurate. In fact, the strength of the aspect would be only 4 Virupas out of a possible 60,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"330 Graha Sutras very negligible. Perhaps in medieval and dark times when man lived a shorter life and did not have the benefit of computers to calculate their aspects, it was acceptable to use this rude and crude method of Graha Drishtis, but with computers here to help us, there is no excuse in this day and age to not calculate Graha Drishtis and use them properly. WHEN TO USE GRAHA DRISHTI Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra has stated that the longitude based aspects of the Grahas are due to their inherent dispositions, thus these aspects are those that are to be used when determining the influence of each Graha’s innate nature. For instance, Saturn is considered to be a dry Graha and will cast a drying influence throughout the horoscope. This drying influence will be indicated by Saturn’s longitude-based planetary aspect and not upon its Rasi Drishti. Similarly, Saturn is Vata and will produce wind throughout the horoscope in accordance with his longitude-based planetary aspect. Saturn also has a dark complexion and will thus darken areas of the horoscope in accordance with its longitude-based planetary aspect. The basic rule is that any time the influence of a Graha’s innate qualities are to be examined, it is these longitude based aspects that are to be considered. Graha Drishtis are also to be used for evaluating a Graha in respect to the favorable and unfavorable influences it receives from the other Grahas as well as when using Nakshatra Dasas. RAHU AND KETU AND ASPECTS There are different views regarding the aspects of Rahu and Ketu. Some do not consider them to have any aspect at all. Those who do consider Rahu and Ketu to have aspects generally consider them to aspect the 5th (120 degrees), 7th (180 degrees) and 9th (240 degrees) with full strength, similar to Jupiter's aspect. However, none of the astrological treatises ascribed to any of the Rishis give these special aspects to Rahu and Ketu and Brihat Parashara Hora"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Graha Drishti 331 Shastra does not give make mention of them in the Sutras on calculating aspects. My experience has brought me to the conclusion that considering Rahu and Ketu to form planetary-based aspects will only mislead one’s predictions. They do, however, have an effect due to the Rasi they are placed in through Rasi Drishti. I believe that due to a factor called Argala, which exerts a type of influence to the 5th and 9th, some astrologers have mistakenly concluded that Rahu and Ketu aspect the 5th and 9th with full strength. Argala, however, is a completely different thing than an aspect and though it yields an influence, it does not yield a planetary aspectual influence. Also, there is the rule that cruel Grahas in the 5th or 9th create difficulties for that which they are 5th and 9th from, but again, this is not an aspectual influence. The influence of a planetary aspect is to cast its natural qualities throughout the horoscope, which Rahu and Ketu do not do. Their natural qualities are all focused in the Rasi and Bhava in which they are placed. GRAHA DRISHTI IN THE VARGAS Astrologers differ in their opinions about whether to consider Graha Drishti in the Vargas. Many of the old-school astrologers do not, while most modern astrologers do. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra does give a Raja Yoga that is specifically dependent upon Graha Drishti in the Vargas and thus it can be safely concluded that Graha Drishti is to be used in the Varga Charts. Graha Drishti in the Varga charts should be done just as it is for the Rasi chart – the degrees of the Grahas should be determined and their exact aspectual value determined as explained in this chapter. CONCLUSION There are thus two types of aspects: Rasi Drishti and Graha Drishti. The first is dependent upon the Rasi in which a Graha is placed. This aspect is very definitive – a Graha either aspects through Rasi Drishti or it does not. The second aspect, Graha Drishti, is dependent upon the longitude of a Graha.

The Moon at 18 degrees of Gemini will aspect every Graha that is at least 30 degrees away from it and no more than 300 degrees away from it, this includes every Graha other than Jupiter. The Moon at 18 degrees of Gemini is 59 degrees behind Rahu. To determine the aspect value of the Moon’s aspect upon Rahu, simply look up the value given for 59 degrees in the above Moon’s aspect table – the value being 14.5 Virupas out of a possible 60. Rahu does not form any Graha aspects and so does not aspect the Moon in return. The Moon is 133 degrees being Saturn, thus to determine the aspect value of the Moon’s aspect upon Saturn, we simply need to look up the aspect value for 133 degrees in the Moon’s aspect table, namely 17 Virupas. Saturn is himself 227 degrees behind the Moon. Saturn’s aspect value upon the Moon can thus be determined by looking up the aspect value for 227 degrees in Saturn’s aspect table, namely 36.5 Virupas. Saturn, therefore, aspects the Moon much more strongly than the Moon aspects Saturn. Saturn is 206 degrees behind Jupiter, the aspect value being 47 Virupas as provided by Saturn’s aspect table. Jupiter himself is 154 degrees behind Saturn. The aspect value for Jupiter at 154 degree is a mere 8 Virupas, as provided in Jupiter’s aspect table. While Saturn aspects Jupiter quite strongly, Jupiter only aspects Saturn feebly, even though they are in the 7th from each other. Mercury at 5 degrees of Pisces is 37 degrees behind Mars.

Maitreya is no different than any modern student of astrology in his desire to know how to pacify the Grahas – the desire naturally arises upon learning the many ways in which the Grahas influence our life. Pacifying the Grahas is known as Graha Shanti, Shanti meaning, “Peace.” The goal, therefore, is to be at peace with the divinities that are the Grahas rather then being engaged in a war that can never be won. Only by being at peace with the Grahas can a person have a comfortable and productive life. This peace is broken when a person transgresses divine laws. Graha Shanti allows us to create peace for transgresses that are producing ill in our lives and which are indicated by the ill-situated Grahas. The act of pacifying the Grahas is known as Puja, meaning, worship, honor and reverence. Proper Puja consists of imagery, Japa (recitation of hymns), offerings, feeding others and charity. Honoring the Grahas in these five ways is sure to bring about peace. Even if a person is only able or willing to honor the Grahas through one of these five actions, significant improvements will be noticed. IMAGERY Imagery is an important aspect of Puja as it serves to focus the mind. During the performance of Puja, mental focus and concentration is everything. The mind has the ability to draw to us that which is concentrated upon. The mind is capable of creating a magnetic force much greater than that of the most powerful electromagnetic magnet that unerringly attracts that which is in the mind. For the mind to exercise this power, it must be concentrated. Images of the Grahas help us to concretely attract the Grahas and thus those things they rule into our lives.

The Sun’s image should be made of copper, the Moon’s of quartz crystal, Mars’s of red sandalwood, both Mercury and Jupiter’s of gold, Venus’s from silver, Saturn’s from iron, Rahu’s from lead and Ketu’s image should be made of brass.

The image, whether drawn on cloth or three dimensional, should be put in the direction of the Graha as provided in the chapter, Slopes of the Grahas. Three-dimensional images should be adorned with gems appropriate to pacifying the Graha or embellished with the fragrance of the Graha and then meditated upon. In choosing a fragrance, those fragrances that smell of the taste of the Graha should be chosen as provided in the Rasa – Tastes chapter. Fragrances of Mars are appropriate for Ketu and fragrances of Saturn are appropriate for Rahu. In respect to choosing proper gems with which to adorn the image, if the Graha is being pacified in order to improve upon a Graha with low Shad Bala then the color gem of the Graha’s Mulatrikona should be chosen. If the Graha is being pacified due to its Ishta being low or due to it having excessive influences from Krura Grahas, then the color gem of the Graha’s exaltation Rasi should be chosen. If the Graha is being pacified due to it being in a bad Lajjitadi Avastha or, simply speaking, in bad dignity, under the influence of inimical Grahas or joined with the Sun or Saturn, then the color gem of the Graha’s own Rasi should be chosen to adorn the image. Rahu should be adorned with grey gems or gems the same as that for Saturn and Ketu with black gems or gems the same as that for Mars.

Lotuses represent the spiritual quality of living in the world but being above it, just as the beautiful lotus blossom sits upon the muddy waters. This is a very important quality of the Sun, which allows for the spirit of self-surrender and sacrifice, which the Sun so often demands. Just as a king must be above all petty concerns in order to rule his kingdom successfully, we need this quality of the lotus to rule the kingdom of the self.

The Moon is the consciousness of the individual self. The Moon’s primary symbolism is white, the color of purity and the color of reflection. This reveals the reflective nature of the Moon as well as the fact that the individual consciousness is a reflection of the soul consciousness. The individual consciousness is an aspect of the soul consciousness, but indeed not the soul consciousness. The Moon controls ten horses. These are the five senses (the Jnanendriyas) and their related five organs of action (the Karmendriyas) mentioned in the Five Elements chapter.

In another hand he holds offerings, which represent the good works and knowledge that he has to offer. His third hand holds a Kamandalus, a water gourd used by ascetics, which represents that he seeks nourishment in those things that are healthy and truly nourishing and that, having this, he need not partake of unhealthy things. This symbolizes Jupiter’s grace that prompts us to choose the good and healthy over the many available ills. His fourth hand blesses with divine protection and graces with “luck.” Jupiter has no animal to ride upon, but walks, which indicates that he is the master of himself – the master who understands himself in the proper context of creation. Venus is described similarly to Jupiter, perhaps due to the fact that these are the two Gurus. The marked difference is that Venus is dressed in white while Jupiter is dressed in yellow. White is the color of purity, the color that Venus shares with the Moon. These two feminine Grahas wear white because feminine energy is always pure. White is reflective and thus feminine energy may reflect evil and darkness though it always remains pure just as a mirror reflecting an ugly scene is itself untouched by the ugliness. The purity of Venus comes from its capacity to love, from devotion. Following what it loves, Venus makes its choices in life and is free from any sin resulting from its choices since it chooses out of love and no evil can come to the person who chooses out of love and devotion. When Venus is afflicted, however, one cannot choose out of the spirit of true love and instead chooses out of pride, lust or desire, in which case there is the need to propitiate Venus.

Saturn carries a trident in one hand, which symbolizes his power to transform, over time, all things. Two of his arms wield the bow and arrow, revealing his nature to deal with difficulties not through sheer courage or recklessness, but from a safe vantage and with patience. Esoterically, the bow symbolizes the spine and the arrow the life force coursing through the spine. Time and the art of restraining (Saturn) the life force in the spine raises the common man into the spiritual man. Saturn’s fourth hand blesses so that one has the strength to endure.

Where Rahu is, we need to become king and master. Honoring Rahu helps us to become this king.

Ketu takes the consciousness, symbolized by the Moon, which has developed through the worldly activity of the other six Grahas, and brings it to a more spiritual"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Graha Shanti 351 realization. Thus he acts upon the consciousness. Anything that he may affect he affects not for the sake of that thing, but for the sake of spiritualizing the consciousness. Ketu’s limbs are also deformed, revealing that he is sickened by his activities and that only by overcoming the ego consciousness, the body consciousness, will he be happy. Ketu’s mace, his only weapon, is a weapon without finesse, a weapon of sheer destruction, revealing the nature of Ketu to destroy, more specifically, to destroy vessels and by destroying, allow the consciousness the opportunity to soar. Ketu does this both by destroying the individual consciousness so that it may merge with the divine consciousness and by destroying some physical vessel of a person’s hope, desire or achievement so that their consciousness can rise above that hope, desire or achievement. Like Saturn, Ketu rides a vulture; likewise Ketu is no stranger to death. In fact, it is through death that Ketu grants his greatest blessings of transcending the limited individual consciousness. Ketu’s non-mace holding hand blesses with personal transformation and spiritual enlightenment. In this Sutra Ketu is given as plural – Ketus, as there are many Ketu’s, not just one. When Svarbhanu was cut in half his head became Rahu and his tail the Graha Ketu and all the comets, which are likewise known as Ketus. The mundane effects of all these numerous Ketus has been described by Varaha Mihira in his Brihat Samhita.

The size of the images should be 108 Angulas. An Angula is the width of the middle of the middle segment of the middle finger. The standard Angula measurement is 17.7 millimeters, thus 108 Angulas is 1.912 meters, quite large. The Angula to be used, however, is that of the owner’s middle digit – the image is to be customized for the user. These are very large images, but fitting as it does not seem appropriate to belittle the Grahas with images greatly smaller than the worshipper. Due to the immense size of these images, it will not be practical for most people to possess a three dimensional image built to these specifications, though anyone can possess a drawn image with these dimensions. ywav[¡ àdeyain pu:pai[ vsnain c, gNxae dIpae bilZcEv xUpae deyZc guGguul>. 15. yathävarëaà pradeyäni puñpäëi vasanäni ca, gandho dépo baliçcaiva dhüpo deyaçca guggulaù. “According to the appropriate color – flower and garment offerings; and especially fragrances, lamps/candles and oblations, as well as gifts of incense and Guggula.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Graha Shanti, 15 Flowers of the appropriate colors should be offered to the Graha in the form of the image and the image should be dressed in garments of the appropriate color or have garments offered to them that are latter given away as charity.

Fragrances themselves are healing and help attune one to the Graha. Lamps and candles help focus upon the image. Oblations of food are very important and foods made of the grains of the Grahas are particularly useful as provided in the Grains of the Grahas chapter. These are to be eaten after honoring the Graha and are commonly known as Prasada. Incense appropriate to the Rasa/taste of the Graha should be lit and offered along with Guggula, an aromatic gum resin known as Bdellium which is used in Ayurvedic medicine and is also mentioned in the Bible, Gen. 2:12 where it appears to have been considered of great value. ySy ¢hSy yd!ÔVymNn< ySy c yt! iàym!, tCc tSmE àdatVy< Éi ́yu ́en cetsa. 16. yasya grahasya yaddravyamannaà yasya ca yat priyam, tacca tasmai pradätavyaà bhaktiyuktena cetasä. “To that Graha the material and food dear to it are offered joined with devotion and offered with concentration.” Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra: Graha Shanti, 16 All these offerings should be presented with devotion and concentration.

Japa is affirmation and concentrated verbal communion with the divine energies that work to change one’s consciousness and one’s life. Japa has the distinct advantage over other methods of propitiating the Grahas in that it can be done by anyone, anytime and has no cost attached to it. Japa only requires concentration and devotion; absentminded and heartless Japa will not bring the desired results. The goal of Japa is to become absorbed in the words of the hymn. This can happen in two ways: through Jnana Japa and Bhakti Japa. Jnana Japa is done with the goal of understanding the true import of the words, in which case one merges with the words as they come to understand the deep meaning of the words. Bhakti Japa is done with the goal of melting into the love of the hymn.

Agni, the all-pervading divine fire is the lord of the Earth, which itself was born out of fire. Mars is himself Kuja, “born of the Earth,” thus Agni is also the lord of Mars. Agni, through Mars, “gladdens watery seeds,” which is to enliven that which is formed in the waters, waters being consciousness.

Soma provides growth, not only physical, but of law and truth. This juice is the power of Indra and is found in such nourishing substances as milk, nectar and honey. This vital essence that provides growth and which nourishes the body, mind and soul is ruled by Venus. Previously it has been discussed how the presiding deity of Venus is Sachi, the consort of Indra. The consort of a deity is its power and so in this hymn the naming of Indra’s power is a calling to Sachi and, therefore, Venus. In this hymn Jupiter/Indra, Venus/Sachi and the Moon/Soma are all being called forth as one cannot act without the other, as has been illustrated by the interchanging exaltation places of the Moon, Venus and Jupiter.

God, referred to as the “Architect,” with the lightening of the misty morning, reveals the shape of that which was shapeless in the darkness of night. That which is revealed is the mystical and brightly appearing, the All that is the created God. Further, as mortals, we should appreciate this vision of God which we are being offered. This hymn thus points us towards the realization that all that is shaped is a manifestation of God. Ketu has several meanings, one of which is “a form or shape,” as well as meaning “brightness,” thus this hymn is an apt one for Ketu. This hymn also has an esoteric meaning.

Imagery, which allows for a tangible experience of the Graha, relates to the Earth Element. Japa, which is merging into the sound and meaning of the hymn, is related to the Ether Element. Offerings are related to the Fire Element, which consumes the offerings and conveys them to the “Gods.” Feeding is related to the nourishing Water Element. Donations, which move an article from one person’s possession into another’s, are related to the Air Element. Thus if one performs all five aspects of Puja the Graha is relieved from any and all constraints. If only one aspect of Puja can be performed, then one should perform the aspect of Puja related to the afflicting Graha’s element. Thus if Puja is being done for Venus who is giving ill effects due to being afflicted by Saturn, donations, ruled by Saturn’s Air element, should be given for Venus. The Sun, Moon, Rahu and Ketu do not rule elements. If one of these is the afflicting Graha, the normal rule of the Sun and Ketu relating to the Fire element, the Moon relating to the Water element and Rahu relating to the Air element should be followed. Additionally, Japa is always effective as all elements are ultimately brought forth from Ether. In times of difficulty, since almost any great burden is the result of Saturn and Air-governed change, donations are always effective.

Life is full and varied and thus there is much to learn about the Grahas. Never in any one book or even in a library of books could be given every indication of the Grahas. The Rishis, however, wisely gave us Sutras that would convey the ideas of the Grahas so that we can apply them to all things that we may ever venture to examine in the horoscope. The trick to learning Astrology well is to memorize the Sutras until they are at the tip of your tongue. As you memorize the Sutras two things will happen. First, you will naturally begin to see the Grahas all around you in many, many varied ways. Second, as you read and examine horoscopes, some indication of a Graha will come to the forefront of your mind – and it will be just that indication that you need to make a brilliant prognostication or prediction. If the Sutras, however, are not memorized well, then upon examining the horoscope the mind will go blank, so spend the precious time memorizing the Sutras given by the ancient masters. Being an astrologer will then be so much easier. Once the Sutras are anchored in your memory, your intuition will be able to sort through the great variety of details that astrology provides through the examination of the horoscope. My commentary on the Sutras is of rather little importance, it is merely an example of how the Sutras may be expanded, as is their purpose. Sutra means “thread,” a thread that is meant to be pulled upon and extended and even used to sew masterful pieces. Don’t be rigid in your interpretations of the Sutras – this handful of Sutras contain all the things in the world that the Grahas have sway over – it is for you to learn to see those things. Again, memorize the Sutras, then, as you contemplate astrology and read charts your mind will expand these Sutras as necessary and you will be able to manage any astrological challenge that comes your way."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"370 Graha Sutras Graha Sutras are just the beginning of astrological study.

So continue learning about Rasis, Bhavas, Nakshatras, Vargas and predictive techniques and then you will be able to use your knowledge of the Grahas to be a very effective astrologer. Throughout this text I have hinted at ways to use these Sutras, such as determining the complexion of an individual, the sex of their children, the nature of their residential environment, etc. In order to actually predict these things the appropriate predictive techniques must be used, which are beyond the scope of this text, as all techniques require an understanding of Rasis, strengths and Dasas. Thus no examples of predicting these things have been given. The actual techniques with which to predict these as well as other things will be provided in future texts on predictive astrology. Before tackling predictive astrology, however, you will want to know your Graha Sutras as well as the remaining fundamentals. Perhaps the most rewarding aspect in studying and contemplating the Grahas is realizing their presence all around us and in everything we do. Remember, the Grahas are a manifestation of Vishnu; therefore, those things that they manifest around us and through us are also aspects of Vishnu, so astrology reminds us of the one eternal truth. I wish you well in realizing this truth as you pursue your study of astrology. If you have enjoyed this book I am sure you will want more and while I am always years behind what my readers want, as I can only write so many books so fast, I have many, many courses available on audio or video or even live which will get you by until the next book, which, with luck will be in 2007. These courses, along with some free classes and articles, are available through my website at www.vedic-astrology.net.

At sixteen, while browsing a bookstore, I came across planetary ephemeris for calculating the position of all the planets and the astrological houses. I was quite amazed at this – that all the planets were calculated to erect a horoscope, for I had only been familiar with Sun sign astrology up to that point. Very much interested, I wanted to purchase the books, but could not afford the seventy-eighty dollars as I was a jobless youth at the time completing my high school education and spending all my free time training for bicycle racing. I did not have to wait long, however, for astrological opportunity to present itself again. Four year later I was visiting an older friend, a wonderful chiropractor, who phoned an astrologer friend of his so that I could"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"372 Graha Sutras have my horoscope read. The astrologer, her name was Nancy, read my horoscope for a good ninety minutes, and being an exceptional astrologer, had much more to say even after ninety minutes. However, my friend was urging me to get off the phone to avoid the high phone rates at the time and so the reading came to an end. The next day, however, I would be driving through the very city in which this astrologer lived and so she invited me to visit her. Needless to say, I was very excited the next day to hear more about my horoscope and so I woke up early and drove the 600 miles to her house way above and beyond the speed limit. (I must have had the fortune of leaving during a favorable Muhurta as I did not get a speeding ticket.) Upon arriving, the astrologer fed a proper lunch to me and then proceeded to teach me how to calculate a horoscope. I was following along, but thinking, “what about reading my horoscope some more, why are we doing this?” but said nothing and learned the calculations that the astrologer wished to teach me. After teaching me the calculations, she once again fed me, as a proper host should, packed me off to bed and woke me early in the morning to send me on my way – without one word about my horoscope. Honest to say, I was quite disappointed in not having more of my horoscope read, but satisfied myself on the trip home by perusing the lessons she had given me. (Again, I must have left during a favorable Muhurta as I was able to peruse the astrology lessons without driving off the road.) Her teaching me how to calculate the horoscope, however, was to prove much more valuable to me than any reading could have at that time. For it was not more than a year later that I was in dire need for answers to a crumbling life. In desperation I called my mother and had her dig up and ship those astrology texts and ephemeris to me. Two weeks of hard study, including a couple of trips to the bookstore, and life was making prefect sense through the astrological looking glass and at that point I began to devote all my time to studying the powerful science of astrology. Since then my studies have been varied. I started out studying Western astrology and in a short while felt very confident and"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"About the Author 373 began reading horoscopes – until one day I was asked specific questions by a client that I could just not answer. This sent me into a new frenzy of study that only served to cause me physical nausea every time I looked at a horoscope. (This is not to be derogatory to the Western tradition of astrology which I believe has much to offer.) After three years of study with the hope of becoming an astrologer, now I could not even look at charts without becoming ill – so what to do? I could not think of anything and so I checked into an ashram with the idea of staying there for eight months. After a month of being in the Ashram, the idea of Vedic Astrology began to appeal to me, so on my birthday that March I ordered a copy of Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and began a serious study of it. (I began at that time to write down my thoughts about the Sutras so as to keep everything organized and those writings have, over the years, evolved into this current text.) Just weeks after getting my hands on Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, I met a young gentleman by name of Gaetano who gifted a library of all the current Vedic Astrology books that were available in English to me. His goal was to become a renunciate and so he was giving up all his texts. He had lived India for several years and studied astrology while there. He only examined my horoscope a few times, but all the things he said came unerringly true, even things that I had thought could never happen. In any case, he was very happy to support my initial efforts in astrology, providing me with not only the books, but a software to calculate the horoscope and money for my first months rent when I left the Ashram. I was very happy to have these books, for in my life teachers had largely come in the form of books. While others may say that they can not study because they do not have a living teacher, or use some other such excuse, I have simply studied and contemplated that which was available to me, whether that was books, people or nature. If we really want to learn, we will have devotion, and devotion turns the heart into a powerful receptor that allows us to learn or possess anything in addition to attracting that which we need in order to learn or progress towards the desired. All one"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"374 Graha Sutras needs, therefore, to learn astrology is the desire to learn it for the sake of the beautiful science that it is. Having a library of astrological texts, both by modern astrologers and translations of the ancient masters, I wasted no time in their study. Over the years I have peeled my library into just the few texts that are not redundant and which really have something useful to say. Of these remaining texts I believe that by far the most valuable are Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Upadesa Sutras, followed by Kalaprakasika and Muhurta Chintamani for Muhurta and compatibility work, Jataka Tattva and Sarvartha Chintamani for Yoga work, and Yavana Jataka and Jataka Parijatha for some extra tidbits not found in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra. Each of these texts is a lifetime of a masterful astrologer’s work and so each of these texts deserves a lifetime of study, though none more so than Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Upadesa Sutras. Over the past two millennia, astrologers have largely used techniques that are not all that scientific or replicable. Sri Yuktesvar complained about this over a hundred years ago – that no text and no astrologer used truly scientific or mathematical techniques. Over the past one hundred years, however, astrology is moving more and more towards becoming a true science, with such teachers as Krishnamurthi, Iyer, Hart de Fouw and KN Rao bringing a scientific approach to astrology. Astrology, however, is greater than any one man, and so it is my great joy to be part of developing scientific astrology. Over the last eight years my studies have revolved around the pursuit and understanding of such scientific techniques – and it has been quite a journey. More a “solving the mystery of the Sphinx” than gathering available information. In order to pursue such techniques, software that calculates the scientific aspects of astrology was necessary, for which reason I began to develop Kala Vedic Astrology Software. At this point I am very happy with my software as it calculates all the scientific techniques from Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and so now for the first time astrologers can begin to practice one hundred percent scientific and methodical"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"About the Author 375 techniques. This brings me to the point of my wife – Srishti, the programmer of Kala. I met Srishti while in India. She was one of several programmers working on various astrological software. It was not long after meeting her that I knew that she was my wife (actually, I had predicted the day I would meet her, my wife, four months earlier, but it was not long after I met her that I knew I would be better off and happier married to her). Srishti has made many things in my astrological life possible. From programming countless theories that failed to programming a great software package to most importantly never holding me back or nagging me over my studies and pursuit of astrology. I remember a time shortly after the birth of our son. We were sorry for money, downright poor. Not making enough to make ends meet and using credit cards to buy diapers and gas. As a provider I was feeling like a failure. So I tell my wife, “I can promote my readings more and then we will have more money.” Here reply was, “You just do your Jaimini Sutras,” (which I was spending all my time studying, in truth, to her neglect.) Whereas any other woman I can think of would have been righteously nagging me about the diapers months ago, she had endless patience with me and believed that I was not wasting my time where I should have been earning money to take care of the family. Thanks to my students, my readers and the users of Kala software her patience with my affair with astrology is finally paying off and now I can finally buy her what she needs. In short, I don’t think I would be where I am today without her. While most of my studies have revolved around Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Upadesa Sutras, I have also quite intensely studied relationship compatibility, Yogas, Muhurta and Gem Therapy. My Muhurta studies are available in Classical Muhurta, which is considered by those who have read it as the most complete and far reaching book available on the subject. I have also authored a few other texts: Vault of the Heavens, Core Yogas and Tarot – Bringing Us Closer to the Truth. It is however, with greatest pleasure that I present"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"376 Graha Sutras this text, Graha Sutras, which I believe will be the most enjoyable study yet. After many years of studying astrology, I have come to believe that, for those of intellectual bent, the best use of astrology is the study of astrology. Astrology is one of the Vedangas, or limbs of the Veda, whose purposes is to facilitate the understanding and use of the Vedas. Astrology’s purpose is thus to assist in understanding the Veda – in understanding the inherent Truth. Amongst the limbs of the Vedas, astrology is considered as the eyes of the Veda, and is thus given preeminence over other sciences. The study of astrology can assist a person in learning to see that everything is an aspect of God, and to live a life of true happiness. So while I do allow some time for the reading of horoscopes, most of my time is spent in researching, teaching and writing. I believe that what an individual can get from having his horoscope read pales besides what an individual gains from the study of astrology, so I prefer to focus on the study and teaching of astrology. (I reckon that my first astrologer, Nancy, must have felt that same way so she just showed me how to calculate the chart instead of reading my chart.) However, I still do readings to keep me “sharp” in the practice of astrology and to serve those others who wish to benefit, if only slightly, from the grand science of astrology."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Appendix 377 Appendix: Table – Indications of Grahas A B C D E F G H I Sun Moon Mars MercuryJupiterVenus Saturn Surya Chandra Kuja Budha Guru ShukraShani
