Astrology comprehends something higber. mysterious and suhtle. It is not a mere appeal to tbe rea.oning faculty of man but it is an appeal to his hidden powers and capacities. Astrological predictions canoot be simply based upon .trict hypothetical principles or vague guesses but a certain amount of intuitive cap.city must be brought to bear upon sucb attempts.

This attitude is due to the fact that they do not approach the s ubject with an unbiassed and unprejudiced mind. Dispassio# nate enquiry alone can enable one to appreciate the truth ~hind any branch of knowledge . In any field o f enquiry. the student will find it useful to remember. it is a major error o f the intellect to attempt to oppose prejudices based on Q priori arguments to tbe evidence afforded by fac ts. The fiDal test of a tbeory is that it should work satisfactorily in prac· tice. Tbis is the test by which astrological theory sbould be judged.

This is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Hindu Predictive Muoio.,. tbe most ancient of all sciences and bad reached considerable perfection in India tbousands of years ago. While the modern scientists acknowledge astronomy. some of them sneer at astrology and reject it with' cont~mpt charg-ing it with the dogmatism of charlatanry aDd superstition. They preaca frankness and research as fair and reasonable; but sbow the greatest bigotry, when the subject of astrology is taken up or introduced. Astrology is the science which comprises the foretelling of tbe regular movements of the planets, the fortunes and mis-fortunes of men, fates of nations. inundations, eartnquakes. plagues. volcanic eruptions. pestilences, and other incidents relating to terrestrial phenomena. In Sanskrit it is called Bora Sastra meaning the science that treats of Time. It il a lso called Jyolisha or the .!\"lJwledge of Lighl from Jyoti or Light which is the root-cause for aU known creation. Accord-ing to the Western interpretations. Astrology is derived from Asler-a star, and Logos-reason o r logic. No sane brain could ever deny the infiuence of planets upon man and how they affect, deter and facilitate bis future career on the three planes of human existence, vit., pbysical characteristics, mental peculiarities and spiritual aspirations. That a certain subtle power, derived from nature. pervades the entire universe, and the earth we inbabit is also subject to this mysterious and subtle power 1s evident to aU. The various elements, encompassing all matter, arc altered by tbe motions of tbis ethereal power. The acts of creation (sr/.Jhll), protec-tion (slhltil and destruction (Joyal are embedded in the womb o f the All-Powerful Time and these variations are brought about as a consequence of this subtle power.

The MOOD being nearest to the earth eIercises much influence on it and as she wanes and WaIes rivers swell. the tides of the sea are ruled and the plants and animals aOected. The Sun as the central figure predominates over the entire arrangement of the celestial system and the other planets aod stars arc directed by his rays. 'rhus, it invariably follows, that all bodies in nature, wbether animate or inanimate, are subject to tbe motions of the celestial bodies.· Not only those that are already in exis-tence are influenced by tbe movements and configurations of planets. but also the impregnations and growth and develop-ments of tbe seeds from which all bodies emanate are moulded by the quantity and quality of these infiuences 'at the time o f impregnation.

By thus knowing the future correctly, man can so create an environment tbat, he can cope with the adverse periods of his life and alleviate the evils, indicated by the planets to a great extent. The human will is free to a certain extent and advance knowledge of the future can enable one to mitigate many evils. There is a proverb: \"Fools obey planets while wise men Contro l them.\" CHAPTER II The Zodiac and the Solar System The zodiac is a broad band or belt in the heavens extend-ing 9 degrees 00 each side of the ecliptic. The ~liptie or the path of the Sun passes exactly through the centre of the wdiac longitudinally. It is an imaginary circle of 360 degrees and tbe ancients divided this zodiac into 12 equal parts of 30 'degrees each, each being named after the constellation. Though each of these signs differs considerably from the other, yet there is a sort of continuity tbrough all the twelve. The quality of each sign is oat equally spread, but every degree io a sign has its own peculiar qualities. The zodiac, known as the Bhachakra in Sanskrit, revolves o n its axis o nce in a day from east to west. The planetary orbs. which the ancients recognised as baving the most powerful inOueoces on our earth are seven , leaving aside the shadowy planets, Rahu and Ketu, and the so called newly di scovered planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto whicb Hindu astrology does Dot recognise. As inhabitants of the earlh, we are concerned with tbe inHuences of these celestial bodies on our planet. All the planets perform the double function of not only revolving on their own axes once in a day (from west to east) but also round the Sun, According to Surytlsiddhanltl, Saturn is the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• Hindu Predictive AtJtoIOl)' most distant planet Crom tbe earth. Jupiter. Mars, the SUD. Venus, Mercury and tbe MOOD come next in the order of their distance from tbe terrestrial globe. Thus wt' see that the nearest planet to our own orb is the MOOD. The velocity of each planet diminishes as its distance from the earth increases. The SUD moves at the rate of rougbly 1 degree of tbis Circle of Light (zodiac) in one day composed of 24 hours or boras, and takes 365 days and 6 hours to complete a circuit round the zodiac. The MOOD takes the average rate of 41 ghatis or I hour and 48 minutts to traverse througb a degree of tbis space. Mars moves at the average rate of 45 days for 30 degrees 0\" takes Ii days per degree. Mercury moves at the averagc rate of 11 degrees a day; but on account of his closenel! to the Sun and due to tbe solar influence, he is very unsteady. He completes his average rUn in 27 days. He gets into forward aDd backward m·otions from tbe SUD and attain a wbat is called astam or combustion. He bariUy takel a day to move in each degree, but mOVes on more rapidly for some time. geta in front of the Sun and tben begins to move slowly and goes backwards from the Sun. These two states of combunion, viz., moving forwards and backwards from tbe position of the SUD, are designated in the astro-nomical works .s p,agaslhambha and pascluuJoslhambha-p,~g jndicatina towards the East of tb~ Sun, and pasclrod indi-catiDg towards the West of tbe Suo. In these dou.ble motion. of backwards and forward., Mercury never gets away more tban 28 degree. in either direction (rom tbe Sun. Though the time aUotted to Jupiter i. one year in eacb sign of 30 degrees, there i. allO lOme variation and tbe J.oviau year or Ba'MS-pathyanulna will be, a little lelS than 12 years in tbe 12 signs; VCUUI moves at the rate of I desree per day. Saturn i. the - ,' The Zodiac I ud the Solar System 7 .Iowest moving planet of the lot. He talces about 2\\ years or 30 month. to move in a sign of 30 degrees and thus he talces 1 month to move in a degree. Rahu and Ketu wbich revolve in tbe Apo$O'YO order, i.e., from east to west, take 18 montbs to travel through each sign of the zodiac. All the planets, excepting the Sun, tbe MOOD and tbe shadowy planets Rabu and Ketu, undergo retrogression or 10kra and tbis will be fully explained in a future chapter. This much of tbe explanation of the solar system seems to be nCcessa~y to facilitate comprehension of the astrological terms described in tbe subsequent chapters.

For the Moon some calculations are necessary. Find out the constellation on the day of birth which can be readily sl!en in the almanac and note down its duration. If it be the one that ends on the same day. then add to this duration, tbe number of ghatis and vighatis obtained by subtracting from 60. the extent of the preceding asterism on the previous day. The sum represents the entire duration of the constellation in question. One-fourth of this gives the duration of a quarter or pada. Add birth time to tbe duration of the constellation on the previous day. This gives bow much of time has elapsed in the constellation at Ihe time of birth. Dividing this by the duration of each quarter, we get the particular quarter of the constellation in which the Moon is. In case the constellation be tbe one that ends on the next day, the duration of the a sterism on tbe day of bi~th and that on the next day must be obtained tbus : Let us assume tbat tbe sunrise on the day of birth of the following illustrative boroscope is at 5-35 a.m. Tbe birth has taken place at 5-35 p.m. Deducting sunrise from birth time (5-35 p.m. == 17 hours, 35 minutes) we get 12 hours.

The earth is egS-shaped and rotstes once a day o n its altis aDd thus all the zodiacal signs are invariably \"cltposed\" to the solar inlluence. As tbe earth is egg-shaped, certain signs arc exposed to a greater extent of time than others; The 12 solar months are named after the 12 signs of the zodiac. On tbe first day of Aries the first degree of that particular sign ri ses in the eastern horizon at sunrise a nd the remaining signs gradually ascend till tbe next day a t sunrise when the sunrise takes place in tbe second degree of Aries, The sunrise takes place in the last degree of the 7.odiac on tbe 30th day of P isces, when the solar year c'nds. Thus the LagRa or the A scendant is that particular point of the ecliptic considered with reference to the particular horizon. Therefo re, ce rtain periods of time are allotted to each of the zodiacal signs to rise, the duration of such periods depending upo n the latitude o f the place. The duration of the signs varies in accordance with the del!ree of the latitude of the pla(.'(: and the student is referred to Appendix B at the end of the 'book by means of which the rising periods of the • .. ario us aigns for the different degrecs of latitude can easily be ascertained.

The Hindu a stronomers of the Nirnyana school trace their o bservations of planets to the fixed zodiac while the Western astronomers. belonging to the Sayan a system, conside r the moving zodi ac commencing from the ever-shifting vernal equinox. The exact period when boltt the zodiacs were it: th e first point is doubted by a number of astro nomers a nd a ccordingly the Aya namsa-precessional di sta nce-or the inc rement between the beginning of the fixed and moveable zodiacs. varies from 19 to 23 degrees. This Ayanamsa is reckoned roughly at 50 ' /3 seconds of arc per year (see Appendix A). Erect the boroscope as per rules given below. Subtract the Ayanamsa for the year of birth from sucb positio ns and tbe H indu horoscope is obtained. In one year the Ayana msa gains by.50 1/3 seconds of arc so that preceSSio n for odd days may conveniently be omitted.

CHAPTER XI On Birth Verification and Rectif.ic8.tion The importance of tbe exact moment of birth need not be stressed. And o nc of tbe toughest jobs of an astrologer is to find the exact moment of birth before venturing to make any predictions. In most cases, the precise lime of birth will not have been recorded for it is natural tbat considerable time will lravc elapsed from the moment of birth to that of recording it. While tbe importance of the correct instant is so much. we cannot lay any hard and fast rules which will cnable us to find out this exact instant. It is accepted by eminent astro-logers tbat the time of birth means the time of the first cry o f tbe child which generally accompanies the first breath. According to Varabamibira, there is an intimate connec-tion existing between the planetary positions at conception and those at birth. Based on this, the Wester'ners have developed their so-called \"Prenatal Epoch Theory\". The Moon is the ,ource-o f impregnation. Therefore it is poss ible to rectify the time of birth by adjusting the Moon and a scen-dant ~t birth and at conuplion. Varabamibira observes tbus in StaDza 26 of Cba ter IV of Brihat Jatoko Eng. Trans. by B. uryanaraln ao) : \"Find the n umber of Dwadasamsas occupied by lhe Moon at the time of conception. Note the zodiacal sign whose name I the Dwadasamsa bears. Count from the next sign as many I signs' as the number of Dwadasam5as by which the Moon may 00 Birth Verification and Rectification \" bave advanced in any particular sign. When the Moon comes to such last sign, the birth of tbe child will occur ... • The author has beeo investigating into this theory and proposes to place befo re the learned readers, the fruits of bis labours in due course. This branch of astrology does not come within tbe scope of a beginner or an amateur. And birtb times can be rectified only by men of experience by a conside-ration o f pronounced life events. The following are some of the rules which are generally employed by astrologers:-J. Multiply the time of birtb in vig~atjs by 4 and divide the product by 9 . The remainder must give the ruling constel-lation when counted from Aswini, Makoa or Moola. Example: Time of Birth 7h 42m 44' p.m. ( I.S,T.) Time of Sunrise: fI' 25m 32\" a.m. (I.S.T.) Janma Nakshatra-Mrigasir\"a. :. No. of hours passed from sunrise to birth 13\" 17Rl 12'. Converting tbis into gbatis and vighatis we get 33-53 ghatis or 2033 vighatis. 2033 x 4 _ 9036, 9 . 1.0~1 )l 4--, ). Rejecting the quotient and counting 5 from Aswini. we get Mrigasira as 1anma Naksbatra (birth constellation) which is correct. If suppose tbe r.emainder in the above is say 8, which means Pusbyami. In such a case adjust the remainder in such a way as to give tbe Jaoma Nakshatra and rectify the time of birth accordingly. • 'Based on tbis, a stries or anicles bas appeared in Tilt An_oLocICAL M\"CAlINt.

An aspect is good or bad according to tbe relation between the aspecting and the aspected planet. All the planets aspect tbe -3rd and 10th houses from th eir locatio n with a quarter sight; the 5th and 9tb houses with half a sight: tbe 4th and 8th houses with tbree·quarter of a sight and the 7th bouse with a full sight. Saturn, Jupiter and r.brs have special aspects. Saturn power· fully aspects 3rd and 10th ho uses; Jupiter, 5th and 9th houses; and Mars~. 4th and ~th hOl!.ses. It will bc seeD that laimini and Tajak writers consider an altogetber different method of reading aspects. Beginners should never mix the o ne system with th e otber. According to laimini all moveable signs aspect all fixed signs, except the adjacent ones. Similarly. all filled s ig ns aspect all move-able signs except the ~djace.J:lt ones . . Common signs aspect each otber. 10 this book we tire devoting ourselves exclusively to Parasara. • 3rd house 600 to 90-; 10tb bouse 2700 to 300\" j 5tb bouse 1200 to 1500 ; 9th house 2400 to 2700: 4th house 900 to 120~; 8th house ltO· to 340· ; aDd 7th houle 1800. '\" \"';a"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":".. Hindu Predictive Astrolol)' The aspect is s ignified \"by referring to the number 01 signs fro m the significator which the aspectiog planet may hold. Thus if the Sun is in Cancer and Saturn is in Taurus, we say tbat tbe Sun is in the third from Saturn and consequcDtI; receives tbe aspect (ltd house aspect) of Saturn. The opposition aspect becomes extremely good when it is produced by Jupiter and the Moon. It is held to be good when benc6es aspect each olher (7th bouse aspect). A planet, aspecting its own house, whether by tbe 7tb hOllse aspect o r special aspect, will naturally increase the signification of that house. ~ ~aye said that Mars aspects tbe 4th 8!ld 8th hQuses in addition 10 the usual 7th bouse aspect . . The !ltb house aspect is a square aspect and sometimes tbis is evil and sometimes beneficial. For iostance, if Mars, as lord or the 4th and the 9th houses (sec Chapter on Key Planets) in which circum· stance he gets special qualification as a Yogokaraka to produce good, aspects by the 4th house aspect a friendly planet, the significations of the aspected planet and the house are greatly enhanced. The same principle applies even in case: of the 8tb house aspect. Jupiter aspects the 5th and 9th houses which. in Western astrology, are J~e aspects. The results ~vary according to the naturalaDd temporal i:ligoities of the aspecting and the aspected bodies. Jupiter'l aspect over any planet al a natural • benefic is of weigbty importance apart from tbe fact tbat be may be temporarily iII·disposed. S'i£,D aspects tbe 3td and the 10th housci. As a natural malefic. his aspects arc bad. But the aspects produce lood in case Saturn acquires beoeficence by temporal situation. Here some observations on aspects have to be made. The euct quantum of an aspect cast by an aspect ins body on an aspected body can be mathematically mealured by following On ASpects 61 the method given in Graha alld Bhava Dalas. But for the. general purposes of predicatio n, until the reader is quite familiar with astrological mathematics, it will be in order if full aspects (7th house or 180) for all planets and special aspects of Saturn. Iupiter and Man are taken into account. In the chart illustrated on page 42 the following aspects are present: Saturn aspects the Sun (Jrd house), Jupiter (7th house) and the ascendant (10th bouse). The Moo n aspects Jupiter (7th house). Mars . Mercury and Venus aspec t the ascendant. Mars also aspects Jupiter (4th house), and Rahu (11th ho use). Jupiter aspects Rallu (5tb house), Saturn and the Moon (7th house) and the Sun (9th house). According to Western astrology, aspects are reckoned from mutual longitudinal distance$ (: f planets. When one planet is at a certain Dumber of degrees away from another body. they are said to be in a spect. The following are the major aspects >-Conjunction:-Two heavenly bodies in the same longitude. Opposition: The distance between the two bodies is 180~ Trine: do, Square: d o . SeItile: do. Paralie'·'declination: When two bodies have the same declination (Kraoli). Tbe effect of an aspect is felt even if tbe planets are not cuctly in the mutual distances mentioned above. Therefore a so-called orb of aspect-and this var ies in each aspect-is allowed.

Take for instance Saturn and the SUD in the example chart. The angular distance between the two planets is n~ 49. The sex tile aspect ceases at 67. Therefore there is no aspect between them. Take again Saturn and Mercury. The mutual distance is ~4° 13/• It is a square aspect (separating) between Saturn and Mercury. There are also other variations of aspects brought ahout by two planets remaining in tbe same sign and Dot in conjunction but another planet occuPY-iog a trine in respect of the two. Readers will do well to refer to aoy teltt·book 00 Westero astrology for more details. The good or bad nature of aspects depends upon the angle of aspects. Foe ins.tance, opposition (1110\") and square (90°) are always held to be evil irrespective o f the nature of the planels forming the aspects. The trine and selttile are gene-rally held to be good. Such a classification of aspects is erroneous. If for instance Jupiter is in Cancer and Mars in Aries, Western astrologers hold this bad. Commonsense suggesls this is an exceJlent aspect and Hindu astrology say:; so. Why should a square a~pect be always bad unless planets involved are malefics 1 I am not'convinced of the soundness of this view. The reader need not worry with these controversial points. But he may take it that aspects as considered by tbe Hindu system have a sound and scientific basis.

Astrology can forewarn the parents of such times o f danger to their children. Astrologers, not the rank and file, those really well-versed in the science. do hold that they can afford the physician a certain prognosis. An astrologer's work in this re spect is priceless in value when compared to that of the doctor.· After the horoscope is cast, the primary question is necessarily tbe probable duration of life. For, wben a c hild bas a poor longevity to its credit, it would be unnecessary to ellamine the other favourable combinations.

After ascertaining to which class a particular horoscope belongs, the marakas o r the death-inDicting planets must be determined and the death predicted under the Dasas of such planctt. I CHAPTER XV Marakas or Death inflicting Planets Marakas arc planets possessed orlhc power of inflicting death. Death generally occurs during the periods and sub· periods of such planets. Suppose a horoscope indicates middle life or Madhyayu. whereas the Dasa of a most powerful rnaraka comes into operation after 80 years. In such a circumstance tbe period of a planet, no matter even if it is less malicious in causing death which comes within the ma1timuID number of years allotted for Madh~ayu, must be considc-rcd as bringing ahout death, in preference to tbe most malicio us one. Ascertain beforehand, whether a horoscope indicates short. middle or long life; det ermine the maraka planets and the times when their influences will cQme to fruition. The 8th house from Lagoa (ascendant) and the 8th from that, i,e., the 3rd from Lagna arc termed bouses of life.

Planets wbo occupy the 2nd are stronger tban the planets wbo own it, in tending to cause death aod the planets who arc in association with tbe lord of the 2nd are tbe most powerful in causing death. Thus the lords of the 2nd and tbe 7th, tbeir occupants and the planets who are in conjunction with them arc tbe maraka planets.

Planets who are not owners of the 2nd and the 7th houses·, and who a re not occupying tbose bouses but wbo join with the lords of tbose bouses, I.e., tbe 2nd and tbe 7th. 4.

For m~rrla8e, tbe 7th h o use is examined and then the most bene-fiCial plan.et whic h assures all marital happiness found out.

It is difficult t o lay down any particular rules which will apply in a ll cases. Therefore, we give some of th e important ru les by way o f example, The reader may draw si milar canc1usions. baving a ll th e time regard to tbe strength and propensity of the planet. The re sult sbould be consistent with the person for whom it is intended, under the condition of life in which he is brought up as well as the phys ical possibility at the time. For instance p olitical success may be predicted in the Dasa of the Sun, if he is in Aries in the 10th house. This political succeSS' wili be at its maximum p rovided the Sun is not aspected by malefics and his pOSitio n is equally strong in th e Navamsa. If he is aspected by Saturn who may be in Aquarius, then in ~Rlte o f tbe SUD bein g in Aries, complete political success canhot bl.. and ought not to be predic ted. The lo rd of t he Oasa has a quality of his owo stamped upon him. This will aga'in be mo dified by th e nature of th e bouse, the nature of tbe sign, the nature of the aspectU\"ag bodies, the nature of the lo rd of the constella tio n tbe Oasa lord is in, tbe favourable and unfavourable situa ti on o f t.he lord o f Oasa in tbe Navamsa and various other factors. In general we may say: 1. The Oasa period of Saturn, if it happens to be the 4th Oasa, will be unfavourable. 2. The Oasa period of Jupiter will be unfavourable if it happens to be th e 6th Oasa. . If Saturn and Jupite r are strong and favourably disposed, the evil effe..:ls get con ~iderably modified. 3.

Some mysterious and s ubtJe power seems to control reaulate the various phase s of human existence, like birth, life and death. operating in a definite order and often transcending reason. logic and com-monsense. The presence and operation of this power is demonstrable by everyday occurrences. Here comes the importance of the laws of Xarma and tbe laws of continuity and eyolution. The Hindus grant the existence of worlds other than our own and the possibility of the soul migrating into good or bad s tates of future existence after death. according a s the KJJrma done in this world is lOad or bad. As Socrates puts it. death is either the cessation\" of all human activities or tbe migration of tbe soul into a happier region. sourt'e 3Dd Nature of Death I7J Philosophers say that death is a stale of tran~ition for the soul to enter into more s ubtle forms of t'lxistence and th~ duration o f life in such states of existence depends upon the balance sheet of Karma at onc's credit at the time of dealh bere. By a scertaining the length of life beforehand, car~fully. and tb~ nature and source of death. it may be possible to prevent many cata~trophes and family strifes in this life. Some aver thai it may also be poss ible to p.ro\\ong the life. by recourse to yoga and other remedies presc ribed by the ancient Mahar-sbis..

So many otber things such as conception, delivery. etc., a re peculiar to the women.

They want to see that no barriers exist between the males and the females, God knows for what purpOSe. Women have been competing with men in aU walks of life.

Tbe planet which becomes king in one year becomes prime minister in the next year and so on. These details can be ascertained by looking into any standard almanac. 4. The Sun and the Moon are generally royal planets; if in any year either of these does oat become k.ing, then during tha' year, the royalty will greatly suffer. Similarly, Mars is tbe permanent commander-In-chief. Ir, however, in any particular year he docs not become the commander-in,chief, the army and navy during that year must suffer. All tbese details must be considered. S. The appearance of eclipses plays a great part in national astrololY. The influences will be exerciled for a period of 6 months before and 6 months after the appearance. The effects of the eclipse will find manifestation in the countries tbroush which the eclipse passes.

That Roosevelt would be elected as the President of America was predicted by tbe author in the September 1932 issue o f TUB ASTROLOGICAL MAGAZINE, wbile the election took. place in Nevember, on the basis of a solar eclipse in that year. It was also pointed out thtlt there would be chaos Bnd confusion in tbe Parliamentary debates in London, that a new Cabinet would be formed, tbat U.S.A. would suffer from great financial troubles and that a number of children would die in England on account of some disease.

It must be noted that when passing tbrough tbe first 10 degrees of a sign, Mars and tbe Sun produce results.

The MOOD transiting the 8tb produces misery, ill-bealth and fear from unexpected sources; ib tbe 9th from herself, pain of mind, chest pain, fatigue of body and the like arc caused. WheD the Moon passes throagh the 10th house, success will attend in every sphere of activity; in the 11th house. tbe persoo will enjoy prosperity. will set 'wealth and new friends; when the Moon transits through the 12th t!&L. he suffers from accidents and injuries. It may be remarked in passing tba, uoless Gochara is combined with Ashtakavarga, results cannot be predicted with appreciable accuracy. suppoa'e the Moon is transiting the sign occupied by her at birth. The Moon produces beneficial results provided tbe benefic dots tbere are above 4. If they are below 4, tben tbe Moon cannot certainly do a. much good as is ascribed to ber. Planets produce good, bad or indi8'erent re sults during tbeir transits at any particular moment, in accordance with the number of benefic dots which the planets o btain in tbeir respective Ashtakavargas (see my book A8htakti-varga System of Prediction for more details regarding Ashtakavarga). Agaio, we have to conlider what is called Vedha <an obstructing force or point) when delineating results according \"to Oochara. The Sun, for instance, tranliting tbe Ilth, 3rd, IOtb and 6th signs from the radical Moon is suppoted to yield good results. The Imooth flowing of luch good results will be obstructed if there are aoy other planetl (simultaneously) transiting the 5th. 9th, 4th' and 12th silns from the Moon • respectively. To be more explicit with refeccnce to. tbe S.un. ifbe transits tbe 11th • .the Vedhuthana johstruchng ~Olnt) will be the 5th; if he transits the 3rd, the Vedastban.a will be the 9th; if be transits the 10th; tbe Vedhastba?a Will be tbe 12th. Suppose the Sun is in the 11 th ; accordlDg to Gochara. tbe results will be honour and. health, wealth and success. Tbese good effects arc produced only when the 5tb (a house . (of Vedha) is not simultaneously transited. b~ any otber ?Ianet· I eltceptiog Saturn; conversely. if tbe Sun IS In the .5tb, 10 tbe course of Gochara, 00 evil will be produced prOVided the 11 th is being transited at the same time by any otber planet. eltceptiog Saturn. Similarly the Vedhasthanas mu~t be con· sidered for all the planets and then the resulls .predlcted. The following arc tbe VedhatlkaJ fo r the different planets. The figures in the nominator indicate the si~ns counted rr~m the birtb Moon when pas~ing through which the re~pe~tlve planets produce good results. Denominator fig~res mdlcate Vedhankas. Take for iostance Ml.ItS. Tbe n~mm~tor 6gurc 3 indicates tbat Mars transiting the 3rd g\\Ycs rise to good effect. The denominator figure 12, just belo~ 3. is the Vedh.a point.

The former traces observations of planets to a fixed zodiac. while the latter considers the moving zodiac commencing fr om the shifting, vernal equinox. It is certain that the greatest Hindu Astrological writers referred to the bed zodiac for predictions. And this fac t is borne out by experience. The increment between the beginning of the \"fixed\" and thl!. \"moveable\" zodiacs or the Nlrayana and Sayana positions is refe rred 10 as Ayanamsa which iDc~ases about 50-Ijl seconds every year. Western astronomy is based upon tbe Saya n a system so that it considers the moving zodiac commencing from the shifting verna) equinox as has already ~en said above. This. if we deduct this Ayanamsa from tbe positions of planets and cusp. of the bouses obtained a ccord-ing to tbe Western system. we will arrive at the Hindu positionl!. Wben exactly the two zodiacs were in tb e first point is do ubted by a number of astronomers and accordingly the Ayanamsa-preces sional distance-varies from 19° to 2)°. I do no t wish to enter into elplaining tbe complicated processes of astronomy at large wbich centre attention on tbe discussion of the exact nature o f Ayabamsa. but merely confine myself to giving a suitable aDd simple method for determining the Ayanamsa. ~ Oo,,\",.Uoo orth. \", •• amn :r79 First of all. cast tbe boroscope of birtb according to tbe European manner and convert it into tbe terms of Hindu zodiac by tbe following process: ( I) Subtract 397 from tbe year of birth (A.D.). (2) Multiply tbe. remainder by SO 1/3 seconds; and reduce the product into degrees, minutes and scco?ds. (3) Subtract tbis Dumber of degree\" mmutes and seconds from the cusps o f the bouses and tbe planets' positions in the Europc:~n figure of. birth and tbe figure tbus obtained will be a..:cordlOg to the Hindu system.
