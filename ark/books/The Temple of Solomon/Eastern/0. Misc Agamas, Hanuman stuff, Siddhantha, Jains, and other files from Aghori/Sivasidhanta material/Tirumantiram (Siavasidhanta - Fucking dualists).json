sects-Saivism, Vaisnavism and Saktism. Long ago theSanatana Dharma was none other than Saivism. Over the centuriesthese other sects have evolved until today they are all knowncollectively by the world as Hinduism. Saivism was the precursor ofthe many-faceted religion now termed Hinduism, and there was atime when there were no sectarian divisions. There was onlySaivism. Today these three sects do exist as important componentsof the Hindu faith. Saivism, Vaisnavism and Saktism hold suchdivergent beliefs and attitudes that they are in fact complete andindependent religions unto themselves. Though autonomous, theyshare in common a vast tradition, a belief in karma, reincarnationand the Deities, and a reliance upon the Vedas as their ultimatescriptural authority. Similarly, the Christians, Jews and Moslems-who do not believe in karma or reincarnation-all hold to the OldTestament as a common scripture though they are of differentreligions. Just as the followers of these religions worship in diverseways in the church, the mosque or the synagogue, so too have thedevotees of Siva, Vishnu and Sakti come to worship separately anduniquely in their own temples. They commonly share the name\"Hinduism,\" while no such common name has evolved to describethe affinity that exists between Christianity, Judaism and Islam,though the relationship is parallel. This is one reason that it is notalways understood that within Hinduism there are three majorreligions which are inaccurately termed sects.Within our Saivite sect, which has roughly three hundred millionfollowers, there are several denominations or sub-sects, all followingdiverse theologies yet united in their unanimous recognition of LordSiva as the Supreme God. These sub-sects are related in a closeway with the theologian who first codified or organized the doctrine.They are also associated through various regions and languages.There are six main sub-sects in Saivism. The Saiva SiddhantaChurch is of the original Saiva Siddhanta expounded by SaintTirumular, associated with South India. Of the six sub-sects, it is theoldest and closest to the Advaita found in the Upanishads and25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Agamas. A divergent school within Saiva Siddhanta evolved out ofthe dualistic interpretations made by the philosopher MeykandaDevar in the Sivajnana Bodham and its commentary, Vartika, onethousand three-hundred years after the original postulations of SaintTirumular were put forth. This school is also known as SaivaSiddhanta. A second sub-sect is known as the Pratyabhijna Saivismof Kashmir, founded by Vasugupta and known also as KashmirSaivism. A third Saiva sub-sect is Vira Saivism, founded by BasavaDeva in Central India, commonly called Lingayat Saivism. The fourthis Pasupata, founded by Nakulisa and now associated with Gujarat.The fifth is Siddha Siddhanta of North India whose founder isGoraksanath; and the sixth Saiva sub-sect is known as Siva Advaita,founded by Sri Kanta in South India.It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the Tirumantiramin Saiva Siddhanta philosophy. In the first place, it is the earliest fullstatement of Siddhanta, \"the end of ends,\" composed over 2,000years ago. It is perhaps the most complete and profound expositionof the subtle theology of Saiva Siddhanta ever written, so filled withthe esoteric and the abtruse that it has not through its long historybeen read or studied outside of the conclaves of scholars-though inthe last two decades this trend has shifted and will continue nowthat a complete English edition is available. Within the context ofother Saiva scriptures of South India, the Tirumantiram is the tenthof the twelve Tirumurai or \"Holy Books.\" The Tirumurai are collectedworks in the Tamil language written for the most part during the firstmillennium A.D. by various Saivite saints and then gatheredtogether in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They constitute whatmight be looked upon as a Saiva canon and hymnal in which maybe found all forms of spiritual expression from the advaitic principlesof non-dualism and Self-Realization to devotional praises to God,Siva. The Tirumurai have come to be regarded as the verylifebreath of the devotional strength of Saivism. They are second inimportance only to the Vedas, Upanishads and Agamas, and theyare sung daily in the temples of the Deities throughout South Indiaand elsewhere in the world where Saivites worship. The remainingTirumurai consist of the Devaram hymns of the Samachariyas-Saints Appar, Sundarar, Sambandar and Manikkavasagar-thePeriya Puranam of Saint Sekkilar, and other works.26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The accomplished and scholarly Dr. B. Natarajan, an internationallyknown Indian economist and planner, has produced this latestEnglish edition of the Tirumantiram. It is not merely the latest; it isthe only complete translation ever made in English. Dr. B. Natarajanhas worked in several capacities for the United Nations as well as ingovernment positions in India. He has written many books andarticles on economics and agriculture and is deeply involved in thenascent science of futurology. Now he has dedicated himself tobring the ancient Tamil scriptures into English. Besides the2Tirumantiram he has undertaken and nearly completed the fullworks of Saint Thayumanivar. The title of the scripture may be bestunderstood with the help of a few words read from the Introduction:\"Tiru in Tamil means 'holy.' The word mantiram (from the Sanskritmantra) is used in two senses, general and specific. In the generalsense it conveys the meaning of devotional prayer composed inspecial words, e.g. Vedic Hymns. In the special sense a mantra isthat which is composed of certain letters arranged in a definitesequence of sounds of which the letters are the representativesigns. Here, a mantra may, or may not, convey on its face itsmeaning. Bija or seed mantras such as Aim, Klim, Hrim have nomeaning according to the ordinary use of language. Tirumular usesthe word 'mantra' in both senses. The title he gave his bookoriginally was Mantra Malai or 'Garland of Mantras.' Here it conveysthe sense of a Book of Prayer. Later in subsequent Tantras heelaborately speaks of special mantras for specific deities and specialrituals and expounds in full the meaning of the Primal Mantra OMand Five-lettered Siva Mantra-Namasivaya-and the ways of intoningit in different contexts. Literally 'mantra' is composed of twosyllables, Man or 'mind' and Tra or 'opening or liberation.' That is,Mantra is that which leads to blossoming or liberation of mind orheart.The typewritten manuscript that is here with us tonight is the firstcomplete edition ever available in English, the fruits of years ofdifficult and subtle translation from the original Tamil. Dr. B.Natarajan has called the Tirumantiram \"a book of Tantra, Mantra,Yantra and Yoga, of prayer and philosophy at once. It is the onlyauthentic work in Tamil on Yoga-Kundalini Yoga especially.

Each tantra covers a different aspect of the Saivitepath. The Proem or Preface commences with an invocation to LordGanesha in the traditional manner and offers an overview of thework. It may be helpful if we summarize briefly the contents of eachtantra.The First Tantra begins with a synopsis of all that is to follow in theSaint's opus. The topics it covers include: Transitoriness of Body-also of wealth, youth and life-Not Killing, Poverty, Dharma of Rulers,Glory of Giving, In Praise of the Charitable, Siva Knows Those WhoLove Him, Learning, Non-learning, Rectitude and others. For thosewho are familiar with the Holy Kural these subjects will seemfamiliar, and they are. The topics of this initial tantra and of the greatwork by Saint Tiruvalluvar are indeed similar.The Second Tantra deals with the mythology of the Deities, with thecosmology of Hinduism, how the world was created, is sustainedand will be destroyed, and of the categories of soul. It also explainsthe allegorical meanings of some of the important Saivitemythological stories and then delves into such theological mattersas the five powers of Siva and the three classifications of souls.The Third Tantra explores the mystical science of yoga, yama andniyama, pranayama, asana, pratyahara or withdrawal of the senseswithin, dharana or concentration, dhyana or meditation and samadhior Self-Realization. It is in essence the same as Patanjali's AstangaYoga but includes Tirumular's mystic insights into each aspect ofthis ancient system drawn from his own experience. It is thus anexposition of yoga as Tirumular conceived it and lived it. Here it maybe interesting to note that these two sages were contemporariesand are said to have lived at Chidambaram at the same time, so it isnot surprising that their approach to yoga is similar.The Fourth Tantra is a highly esoteric work on mantras and yantras.He explains how to draw certain yantras, including the Tiru AmbalaChakram (the \"circle of Chidambaram\").The Fifth Tantra is a very special one. It gives a resume of the28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"essential features of the Saivite religion. This includes the four formsof Saivism, the four stages, the four relationships the soul has withGod, the four realizations attainable and the four aspects of theDescent of Grace. It ends with a delineation of unorthodox paths,conduct to be avoided, and an affirmation of approved margas orreligious paths.The Sixth Tantra covers a variety of aspects of Saivism and is morereadable than most of the others. Some of the areas covered are:the Siva Guru, attainment of Grace, renunciation, the signs of sin,penance, jnana and Siva darshan in people, and a description ofworthy and unworthy persons.The Seventh Tantra is a treatise on some advanced and highlytechnical aspects of Saivism. It is partly written as an exposition ofTirumular's own realizations. It discusses the Lingam, Grace andcorresponding attainments, mudras, control of ida and pingalanadis, worlds reached by different classes of yogis on death, andthe Sat Guru.The Eighth Tantra covers many of the important theologicalelements of Siddhanta and is certainly one of the most inspiring.Among the concepts presented are expositions of: the five sheaths(bodies), the eleven avasthais (states), the three padarthas (pati,pasu and pasam), and how they are essentially one, the 36 tattvasand their elaboration into 96 tattvas, the four states (waking,dreaming, dreamless sleep and turiyam or the \"fourth,\") andTuriyateetam or the \"state beyond the fourth,\" the three malas, thefreeing of the mala fettered soul (Iruvinaioppu, malaparipaka, andSaktinipata), the mahavakiyam of the Upanishads, advaiticrealization where the soul becomes Sivam leaving behind thetattvas, malas and all avastais, the true Siddhanta where knower,known and knowledge become one, the affirmation of Siddhantaand Vedanta as the same, the three gunas, the dasa-karanas, andthe extirpation of desire as a necessity for Realization.The Ninth Tantra is essentially a description of the fruits ofrealization. This includes an account of the attainment of akasa, thebudding up of knowledge, the bliss of true knowledge, the state ofliberation, and the Samadhi of Silence. It also contains descriptionsof Siva's various dances, the ashram of the Guru and the meeting of29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the Guru. These nine tantras end with hymns of praise to Siva and adescription of Siva's all-pervading nature.Even this brief account of the contents of the tantras is sufficient toshow that the Tirumantiram contains in its concentrated and conciseverbal gems all the fundamental doctrines of Siddhanta. We hopethis brief introduction helps us all to comprehend the depths ofGurudeva's thoughts.30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"TIRUMANTIRAM: FOUNTAINHEAD OF SAIVA SIDDHANTA.I want to introduce you to Saint Tirumular who is the veryfountainhead of Saiva Siddhanta, and to his scripture, theTirumantiram, considered the final authority on subtle matters ofphilosophy and theology in Saiva Siddhanta. In fact, it is said tocontain the whole of Saiva Siddhanta. Saint Tirumular is atheologian of our faith, but not merely a theologian. He is also asiddhar, an accomplished yogi. Our Hindu scriptures come fromsuch great men, men who have attained to the deepest realizationsthrough their sadhana and their devotion. When their awarenessdwells in the superconscious states resident in all men butpenetrated intentionally by only a few, and when they speak outfrom that state, we consider that it is not man himself who has thusspoken but the Divine through man. Saint Tirumular was such asiddhar, and his words are valued as a divine message for mankind.Those of you who have been on San Marga here on Kauai haveseen the beautiful life-size granite statue of Saint Tirumular thatarrived here along with the statue of Saint Tiruvalluvar, the author ofthe Tirukural. In India during Tiruvalluvar's time there was neitherpaper nor pens, so writing was accomplished with a stylus, thecharacters being scraped or scratched into a specially preparedleaf, called an Ola leaf. Many ancient scriptures and literature wereproduced in this manner, and it is amazing that some of the originalwritings so made still exist today. Certainly no modern day paperwould have withstood the centuries so well! The statue of SaintTirumular shows him sitting in the lotus posture, deep in meditation,while Saint Tiruvalluvar is seated with a small writing table on his lapcomposing his sacred verses with stylus in hand. His Tirukuralspeaks on virtuous living. It gives us the keys to happy andharmonious life in the world, but it doesn't give any insights into thenature of God, whereas, the Tirumantiram delves into the nature ofGod, man and the universe in its depths. Taken together, theyspeak to all Hindus and offer guidance for every aspect of religiouslife, the first addressing itself to the achievement of virtue, wealth31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"and love, while the second concerns itself with attainment ofmoksha or liberation. The Tirumantiram is a mystical book and adifficult book. The original text is written in metered verse,composed in the ancient Tamil language. Saint Tirumular is the firstone to codify Saiva Siddhanta, the final conclusions, and the firstone to use the term \"Saiva Siddhanta.\" It is a document upon whichthe entire religion could stand, if it had to. It is one of the oldestscriptures known to man. I was very happy to find that all my ownpostulations, gathered from realization, are confirmed in this greatwork. That is why this book is so meaningful to me-as a verificationof personal experience and a full statement of the philosophicalfortress erected and protected by our Guru Paramparai.It takes a bit of meditation to understand the Tirumantiram becauseyou have to know occultism and scripture to catch the meaning. It iscomposed in rhyme and cloaked in code-when the Five become Sixand the Seven become Twelve and so on, all talking about thepetals of the chakras and the esoteric bodies of man or the materialworld components known as tattvas. For these tantras Brahminpriests and shastris from various parts of South India had to behired to help in deciphering the deeper, more abstruse verses aboutthe kundalini and other mystical subjects. Like all mystical writingsone can only understand this scripture by close study with ateacher. Why is that? Because mystics are cautious, protective oftheir special knowledge that it does not get into the wrong hands.They therefore present their work minus a few important keys thatthe preceptor or Sat Guru has to fill in for the disciple who hasproven himself worthy. It is something like a great chef who mightwrite down all his finest recipes but leave out one or two crucialingredients to preserve his reputation. Thus, many of the mantras oryantras spoken of in this or other texts are correct as far as they go,but usually leave out a necessary key which makes them work. Thatdoes not mean they are useless. It does mean, however, that thefullest use cannot be realized by merely reading or studying fromthe books.There is a timeless quality about Saivism-which preceded Hinduismas we know it today-that sets it apart from the modern faiths on theplanet such as Christianity and Islam. Of course, we know that thefounders of Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were all good Hindus.Saivism is so very ancient that it appears among the first civilizations32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"unearthed by archeologists. It is our belief that Saivism is as old asman himself, the original or seed religion from which all others havesprung forth; and since they are the offspring of Saivism we lookupon them as parents look upon their children, with a deep love anda hope that they will do well and a look askance when they don't.There never was a time when Saivism, the Sanatana Dharma, didnot exist on the planet. Other religions trace their lineage to a man,to a founder, to a messiah or a theologian. Saivism does not. It hasno founder because it was not founded by man. It is coexistent withman. That makes Saivism unique, different from all the religions andsects that followed it. Look into history and you will see it is the onlyreligion without a beginning, without a founder and a date it wasfounded. Now one of the oldest of the preserved theologies ofSaivism available to us today is that of Saint Tirumular. Of course,his was not the first theology, just one of the oldest to be preserved.He did not start anything new. His work is only a few hundred yearsolder than the New Testament. He codified Saivism as he knew it.He recorded its tenets in concise and precise verse form, drawingupon his own realizations of the truths it contained. His work is notan intellectual construction, and it is not strictly a devotional canoneither. It is based in yoga. It exalts and explains yoga as the kinglyscience leading man to knowledge of himself. Yet it containstheological doctrine and devotional hymns. It is the full expression ofman's search, encompassing the soul, the intellect and theemotions.Saint Tirumular's story begins more than two thousand years ago inthe Himalayas where the great rishis had gathered in conclave apartfrom the rest of the world holding fast to the Sanatana Dharma asthey pursued their own meditations to ever deeper strata. From timeto time these ashram communities would send out members inresponse to the needs of the world, pilgrims who would travel byfoot, taking the Eternal Truths to be taught and reestablished whereperhaps superstition or alien religions had gained a foothold. Theserishis traveled throughout the known world in those early days,spreading the Sanatana Dharma, Saivism, far and wide. It was aone teaching, but people adapted it to their own understanding andculture and local conditions, and thus the various religions of theworld arose. Saint Tirumular was such a Himalayan rishi, a siddharsent on mission to South India to spread the purest teachings of33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Saivism to the people there. Hinduism is a missionary religion.Everyone within it, myself included, is on a mission or is purifyinghimself through sadhana enough so that he can be given a missionfor the religion from some great soul or a God perhaps. This is thepattern within Saivism, and Saint Tirumular's mission was tosummarize and thereby renew and reaffirm at one point in time thefinal conclusions of the Sanatana Dharma, the purest Saiva path,Saiva Siddhanta.Rishi Sundaranatha, which was his name before he was sent to theSouth, had to walk all the way. Along the way he halted near thevillage of Tiruvavaduthurai where he found the body of a cowherdwho had died in the fields. The milk cows were wandering aroundaimlessly, lamenting the death of their master whom they clearlyloved. The sight moved Rishi Sundaranatha deeply, inspiring him torelieve the anguish of the cows. An extraordinary miracle occurred,a boon from Lord Siva to help the cows and also to assist the sagein his task. Leaving his physical body hidden in a hollow log, RishiSundaranatha used his siddhis or yogic powers to enter and revivethe lifeless body of Mulan-that was the cowherd's name. Hecomforted and cared for the cattle and led them back to the village.Returning to the fields he was unable to find his original physicalbody! He searched and searched, but it was not to be found. It hadsimply vanished! The Rishi was deeply perplexed, and he sat inmeditation to come to some understanding of these strangehappenings. Through his spiritual insight he discerned that it wasLord Siva Himself who had taken his body, leaving him to livethereafter in the body of the Tamil cowherd. He took this to beSiva's message that he should keep the South Indian body andserve in that way. He accepted it all as Siva's will and was thereafterknown as Tirumular, or the holy Mular, for everyone realized thatsome extraordinary change had taken place in their village cowherd.Of course, there were certain advantages. For one thing, he couldnow fluently speak the language and knew the customs of theSouth. He stayed there and recorded the wisdom of the Upanishadsand Saiva Agamas in the local language, Tamil.Saint Tirumular began his mission of establishing the purity of theSaivite path soon thereafter when he settled down nearChidambaram, an ancient temple of Lord Siva as Nataraja, the Kingof Dancers. There he worshipped near a Banyan tree where there34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"was a Swayambhu Lingam. That Lingam is revered by Saivites eventoday in a small shrine within the Chidambaram walls, and you canworship there on pilgrimage just as he did so long ago. It was therethat he began composing the Tirumantiram. Legend has it that thesage retired to a cave where he would sit in samadhi for a full yearwithout moving. At the end of each year he would break hismeditation long enough to speak out a single Tamil verse giving thesubstance of that year's meditations. Each verse composed in thismanner was just four lines long, but the wisdom each contained wasboundless. He wrote over 3,000 verses in all. This may not beaccurate by the calendar, but it is true to the spirit and quality of theTirumantiram, which has within it the wisdom of three thousandyears of meditation. It is without a doubt the most complete andauthoritative scripture ever written. There are few before or sincehis time qualified to understand all the Tirumantiram says, muchless to improve upon it. It is that perfect and that complete.Today we hear the term \"Siddhanta\" and various meanings of theword may come to mind. For some perhaps their immediate thoughtwould be Meykanda Devar and his interpretation of SaivaSiddhanta. For others some concept of a philosophy halfwaybetween Advaita-Vedanta and Dvaita, a vague area of unclarity, andfor others various literal translations of the word such as \"true end,\"\"final end\" or \"true conclusion.\" The term \"Siddhanta\" appears forthe first time in the Tirumantiram. The word anta carries theconnotation of goal}conclusion, as does the English word \"end.\"Tirumular's specific use of the word was \"the teachings and the trueconclusions of the Saiva Agamas.\" And these he felt were identicalwith Vedanta or \"the conclusions of the Upanishads.\" In fact, hemakes it very clear that pure Saiva Siddhanta must be based onVedanta. Siddhanta is specific, giving the sadhanas and practicaldisciplines which bring one to the final Truth. Vedanta is general,simply declaring in broad terms the final Truth that is the goal of allpaths. There are those who would intellectually divide Siddhantafrom Vedanta, thus cutting off the goal from the means to that goal.But our Guru Paramparai holds them to be not different. How canwe consider the mountain path less important than the summit towhich it leads us? Both are one. Siddhanta and Vedanta are onealso, and both are contained in Saiva Siddhanta. That is theconclusion of scripture and the conclusion of my own experiences35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"as well. The Suddha Siddhanta of Saiva Siddhanta is Vedanta.Vedanta was never meant to stand alone, apart from worship, apartfrom religious tradition. It has only been taken in that way sinceSwami Vivekananda brought it to the West. The Western man andWestern-educated Eastern man have tried in modern Vedanta tosecularize traditional Sanatana Dharma, to take the philosophicalconclusions of the Hindu religion and set them apart from thereligion itself, apart from Chariya and Kriya-service and devotion.Vedantists who are members of other religions have unintentionallysought to adopt only the highest philosophy of Hinduism to theexclusion of the rich customs, observances and temple worship.They have not fully realized that these must precede yoga for yogato be truly successful. Orthodox Hindus understand these things in alarger perspective. These same problems of misinterpretation musthave existed even in Saint Tirumular's time, for he writes that\"Vedanta is Suddha (pure) Saiva Siddhanta.\" (Verse 1422). \"Thefaultless Jnani is the Lord of endless wisdom in whom has dawnedthe final Truth of Siddhantam, the cream of pure Vedantam.\" (Verse1428).It may be that Saint Tirumular pioneered the reconciliation ofVedanta and Siddhanta. But what is the Vedanta that Tirumular wasreferring to? Sankara, with his exposition of Vedanta, was not tocome for many centuries. Thus, concepts such as Nirguna andSaguna Brahman being two separate realities rather than onetranscendent}immanent God, the absolute unreality of the world,and the so-called differences between the jnana path and theprevious stages had not yet been tied into Vedanta. The VedantaTirumular knew was the direct teachings of the Upanishads. If thereis one thing the Upanishads are categorical in declaring it is Advaita,\"Tat Tvam Asi-Thou art That,\" \"Aham Bramasmi-I am Brahman.\"And when Saint Tirumular says that Siddhanta is based on Vedantahe is using Vedanta to refer to this Advaita, which according to himmust be the basis of Siddhanta. This is perhaps one of the mostimportant essentials of Tirumular's Siddhanta to be brought forwardinto the Siddhanta of today, for it did, in fact, stray from the Rishi'spostulations.That is why we occasionally use the term \"Advaita Saiva Siddhanta.\"It conveys our belief in the Siddhanta which has as its ultimateobjective the Vedanta. It sets us apart from the Dvaita Saiva36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Siddhanta school of interpretation begun by Meykanda Devar whichsees God and the soul as eternally separate, never completelyunified. It is not unusual to find two schools, similar in most ways,yet differing on matters of theology. In fact, this has been truethroughout history. It has its source in the approach to God. On theone hand you have the rishi, the yogi, the sage or siddhar who isimmersed in his sadhana, deep into yoga which brings forth directexperience. His conclusions will always tend toward Advaita, towarda fully non-dual perception. It isn't even a belief. It is thephilosophical aftermath of experience. Most Sat Gurus and thosewho follow the monastic path will hold firmly to the precepts ofAdvaita Saiva Siddhanta. On the other hand there are thephilosophers, the scholars, the pundits. Relying not on experienceand ignoring yoga, they must surmise, postulate, arrange andrearrange concepts through an intricate intellectual process in aneffort to reason out what God must be like. These are notinfrequently the Grahastras and their reasoning leads them to oneor another form of Dvaita Saiva Siddhanta. These are both validschools. They are both traditional schools, and comparisons areodious. But they are very different one from the other, and it is goodthat we understand those differences.Of course, we don't believe in controversy between the varioustheologies of Saivism. Contention, argument and dispute neverbrought a single person closer to Sivajnana. These kinds ofquarrelsome discussions are interesting to the intellect, but have anegative influence on spiritual unfoldment. They should be avoidedby every sincere devotee. In their place we must find a commonground. We must work together for the benefit of Saivism as awhole. If differences persist, let them be. Hold to the unifyingelements and let Saivism surge forward. We don't want to be likethe Christians, busy arguing with each other and unable to worktogether for the benefit of their religion which has been fragmentedinto hundreds of partial religions each claiming to be the one andonly true whole. Ours is a religion and has always been a religion ofacceptance and understanding, able to harmonize differences. Thatis how we look at these controversies. We accept them, and themission goes on.The verses of the Tirumantiram are understandable if you learn how37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"to study them and meditate within yourself. They are importantbecause they tell about what our religion believes about inner,spiritual matters-about the soul and the world and their relationshipto Siva. It is very important to remember that what a person istaught to believe creates his or her attitudes toward others andtoward the world and stimulates or suppresses desire. Beliefs createattitudes. We base our values and attachments upon what we weretaught to believe, and yet those beliefs may not be precisely knownto us though they are the compass of our destiny in this life. As ourbeliefs guide our spiritual evolution, it behooves us to know whatthose beliefs are. For example, when the belief is held that God andthe soul are coexistent and that God did not create the soul and thetwo will never merge as one, this causes a certain attitude ofindifference toward the practice of yoga and the realization of God.When on the other hand the belief is held that Lord Siva did createthe individual soul, the attitude of striving for union through Chariya,Kriya and Yoga persists. I call these philosophies which believe thatGod is eternally separate from the soul \"terminal philosophies.\"It has been asked, \"If Siva created the soul, then is not the souldifferent from Siva?\" For our answer let us look at nature. When atree \"creates\" a fruit, that fruit is not a \"something else.\" It is notdifferent from the tree. The Western idea of creation is a flash oflightening and the world appears as an entity different from theCreator. The truth is more like the example of the tree, though thatanalogy is only a partial analogy and does not explain how the soulmerges with the Absolute. All of creation is the manifestation ofSiva's own Being, like the fruit is the natural manifestation of thetree. Thus souls and the world are Siva. My beloved Gurudeva,Yogaswami of Columbuthurai, said some wonderful things aboutthis. He said, \"It will not be an overstatement if I say that man isGod.\" He also said, \"Nothing exists except the Lord. Everything isHis action. Nothing exists apart from God. It is like the waves andthe ocean.\" This is my belief, too.People who hold to the belief in an eternal Hell where souls burnforever for their sins will have attitudes of a more or less fearfulnature. But for those who believe that God created the soul withform and with a superconscious intelligence and that the two willultimately merge in non-dualistic union, religion has meaning. Theywant to convert others to it and have the power to do so as a boon38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"from Lord Siva, God of all the realms.God Siva created the soul. How did he do this? Was it like a pottershaping clay into a pot? Was it like a carpenter creating a house outof lumber? It was more like the tree. In order to create another tree,the tree sends out its branches and the fruit grows on the branchesand the seed grows within the fruit. The fruit drops off and the seedsprouts and a shoot comes out; that shoot becomes a twig, then asapling, then a small tree, and then a large tree. Finally, the tree isfully matured and sends out its fruits and begins the process all overagain. In a similar way Lord Siva has created individual souls. SaintTirumular assures us of this in one of his many statements aboutSiva the Creator: Of yore He created the worlds seven, Of yore Hecreated celestials countless, Of yore He created souls withoutnumber, Of yore He created all-Himself, As Primal Param,uncreated. TANTRA TWO VERSE 446We must understand the difference between the Self-God,Parasivam, and the soul. Many people think that the Self issomething that you get. You pursue it and after a while you get it,like you get something in the world. But the Self is not separatedfrom you by even the tiniest amount. You cannot go someplace andget it and bring it back. The formless, transcendent Self is neverseparate from you. It is closer than your heartbeat.God Siva is called the Primal Soul because He is the perfect form,the original soul who then created individual souls. The individualsoul has a beginning, and it has an end, merging with God. It hasform as well. All form has a beginning and an end. The AbsoluteSelf, Parasivam, is formless, timeless, endless and beginningless.All things are in the Self, and the Self is in all things. Many peoplethink of the Self as an object to be sought. You start here and yougo there, and you get the Self. You pursue it today; and if you don'tget it today, you try again tomorrow. It's different than that. It comesfrom within you more as a becoming of your whole being thansomething that you pursue and get. And yet you seem to pursue it,and seem to get it. It is very difficult to explain.The individual soul is different. The soul has a form. The soul isform, a very refined and subtle form, to be sure, but still a form andform obeys the laws of form. The soul has a beginning in Lord Siva39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"and an end in union with Him. The purpose of life is to know God,your very Self. This is the end of all religions, of all religious effort.This is why we say that religion is this process of lifting ourselves up,attuning our minds to the laws of life so that we become strongerand more mature beings. We become higher beings, living in thehigher chakras, and we come closer and closer to God. God doesn'tcome closer to us. How will God come any closer? He is closer toyou right now than your own thoughts. He is nearer than breathing,closer than hands and feet.I shall explain the soul in yet another way for I see a questioninglook in some of your faces. Man has five bodies, each more subtlethan the last. Visualize the soul of man as a lightbulb and his variousbodies or sheaths as colored fabrics covering the pure white light.The physical body is the outermost body. Next comes the pranicbody, then the physical body's subtle duplicate, the astral body.Then there is the mental or intellectual body in which one can travelinstantaneously anywhere. Then comes the body of the soul, whichI term the actinodic body. This is the body that evolves from birth tobirth, that reincarnates into new outer sheaths and does not diewhen the physical body returns its elements to the earth. This bodyeventually evolves as the actinic body, the body of light, the GoldenBody of the soul. This soul body in its final evolution is the mostperfect form, the prototype of human form. Once physical birthshave ceased, this soul body still continues to evolve in subtle realmsof existence. This effulgent, actinic body of the illumined soul, evenafter Nirvakalpa Samadhi, God-Realization, continues to evolve inthe inner worlds until the final merger with Siva.I like to say, \"God, God, God.\" There is one God only, but man'scomprehension of That is helped by consciously exploring the threeaspects of the one Divine Being: the Absolute, Pure Consciousnessor the Self flowing through all form, and the Creator of all that is.Lord Siva is the Absolute Self, Parasivam, the timeless, formless,spaceless Reality beyond the mind, beyond all form, beyond oursubtlest understanding. Parasivam can only be experienced to beknown, and then it cannot be explained. Lord Siva is pureconsciousness, the substratum, or Primal Substance of all thatexists. He is the Energy within all existence. He is Satchidananda, orTruth, Consciousness and Bliss, the Self that flows through all form.40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Lord Siva is the Primal Soul, Mahesvara, the Original and mostperfect Being. He is the Source and the Creator, having never beencreated. He is the Lord of all beings. He created all souls out ofHimself, and He is ever creating, preserving and destroying forms inan endless Divine Dance. When I was nine years old, I was taughtthat Lord Siva is God-God the Creator, God the Preserver, and Godthe Destroyer. To this day I know and believe that Siva is all ofthese, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. These are the final conclusionsof Saivism, the Sanatana Dharma. The Upanishads state it in thisway: He is the one God, the Creator. He enters into all wombs. TheOne Absolute Eternal Existence, Together with His inscrutablemaya, Appears as the Divine Lord, and Personal GodEndowed withmanifest forms. With His Divine Sakti He holds dominionOver all theworlds. At the time of the CreationAnd Dissolution of the UniverseHealone exists. Our Lord is One without a second. With His DivineSaktiHe reigns over all the worlds. Within man He dwells, And withinall other beings. He projects the universe, He maintains it, And Hewithdraws it into Himself. He is the Origin and the SupportOf all theGods; He is Lord to all. He sees all and knows all. Thou dothpervade the universe, Thou art consciousness itself, Thou artCreator of Time, Thou art the Primal Being.Whether He manifests existence out of Himself or withdraws itentirely into His Being, existence is all of Himself, all is of Siva, theAuspicious One. Existence is indeed eternal, yet manifesting anddissolving in natural cycles of time and space. When the scripturesspeak of the world or the soul as being eternal, we must understandthat it is not any particular part of the world or any single soul thatexists forever. Rather it is the existence of that which we call world.When this world ends, worlds and worlds will continue theirexistence in other parts of this universe. And when a great soulmerges forever into Siva, there will be other souls working their waythrough their karma toward moksha. Similarly, there are always pinetrees on the mountain tops. They have been there for millions ofyears. But those are not the same trees. In this sense we can saythat world and soul are eternal, and this is to me the most profoundunderstanding of these references in scripture.You must all study the great scriptures of our religion. These divineutterances of the siddhars will enliven your own inner knowing. TheTirumantiram is similar to the Tirukural in many ways.

Just understandthat it could easily take a lifetime, several lifetimes, to understand allthat is contained in this scripture, that it is for those deep into theirpersonal sadhana. It was given by the saint to those who fully knewof the Vedas and the Agamas, and to understand it you too will haveto become more familiar with these other scriptures, slowlyobtaining a greater background.In making our selections from the Tirumantiram we have chosenthose verses that would be most readily understood and which,taken as a whole, would offer a good example of the contents of theentire work for those who may never receive the full edition.
