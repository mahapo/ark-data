Because, the God who revealed that scripture is not different from the words which constitute that scripture. The articulated word itself should be considered as the principal Deity. Moreover, if it is claimed that the Deity exists as different from the word, it cannot go and presents itself simultaneously in various places where the yajnas are performed since it is associated with concrete form comparable to our own form. The existence of God cannot be established even a little through valid proofs. All the proofs stated by those who argue for the existence of God( such as direct perception, inference, verbal testimony and others) do not become established even to a little extent. They do not serve the intended purpose. Even the verbal testimony becomes fruitless, since apart from the word there does not exist a thing distinct from that.

That divine form of the Lord never gets deteriorated, deformed or degenerated like our own bodies. Therefore, your statement that ‘a person associated with a concrete form cannot present himself simultaneously in various places’ is not justifiable. Or, your argument that there is no deity such as Indra as different from the denoting word ‘Indra’, holds good even with the words such as pot, moon and so forth. But, neither the mere word ‘pot’ could fetch the water(since, apart from the word ‘pot’, there doe not exist the visible and actual pot) nor the mere word ‘moon’ could diffuse the cool and bright rays. Therefore, apart from the words such as Indra and others, there do exist the things as indicated or intended by them, as different from the articulated words. How could the words which denote actions and forms be inseparably one with those actions and forms themselves? All the courses of action would be deprived of their intended purpose, if there is inseparable oneness between the words and the things or actions indicated by them. Your declaration that all things are unreal does not stand to reason, since everything is governed by the relation of cause and effect. If the elements such as the ether, air and others are unreal, how is that they are dissolved and created again? They are evolved from certain causal sources and absorbed into them after a lapse of considerable duration. So they are real. Even the common worldly usages cannot be set aside as baseless, since they are rooted in an age long and valid tradition.”   R\b\u0012 \t\u0005\r\u0005\u0019!k\u0016 #\u0015\u0018(\u0005 ू#\b!\u0012\u0005\u0019।+\u0007 \u001e>\u0017   (\u0005'\u0003l\r \t\u00055C\u0005\u0019 \tDm ूD\u0012\u0010H\u001c\tF\b\u0015\u0006॥ \u0017  १G   n i\f \r\u0018%\u0005\u0001\u0005( \tळD \r\tँ\u0018\u0012ब\u0012\u0006।\u001e \u001e\u0007>+   \u0012L\u0016\u0005\b\r\u001b (\u0014\u0005\u0018\u0006 C%\u0001\u0005\u0019 \u0001Ll\u0016a\u0006॥ \u001e\u001e=  १Q   \u0012 \u0012\u0001\u0002\bp%\u001f\b\u001c< (\u0005\u0001\b\u001c<\u0005C\tM\u0012\u0005\u0006।\u0007>++   iti vādānuṣaṅgeṇa haraśaṁsā praharṣitān|   sāśṛgadgada vācastān vīkṣya prīto'bhavaddhariḥ||  15   svaṁ rūpaṁ darśayāmāsa vajrī devaśśatakratuḥ|   taruṇāditya saṁkāśaḥ stūyamānaṁ marudgaṇaiḥ||  16   te tamṛgbhiryajubhiśca sāmabhiścāstuvannatāḥ| In this way, the Sages became delighted and inspired in the arguments and counter arguments centering on the nature of Isvara. Consequently their eyes were filled with tears of joy and their words became exceedingly choked and stuttering, exposing their inner bliss.

Having become pleased with the Sages, Indra, the bearer of thunderbolt and the accomplisher of hundred yajnas , revealed himself before them, manifesting in his divine form endowed with the brilliance of the young rising sun and being adored by the hosts of celestial beings known as ‘Marudganas’.

They are with the same resplendence as that of Vidyesvaras who are existing in the Pure Path.   \u0012!\u0007+ S: \u001c\u0003\t\u0005\u0019 R\r %\u0010w%! \b(F%।\u0017\u001e \u0007 \u0007+   ू\u0014\u0005\u0018%\u001b\u0012\u0010\\! %\u0010H3:\u0001\f\f\u0012॥ \u0007\u0007++>  २४   \b\u0018\t\u0010lD\u0016 R\r &\u0005? \u001e\u0019 \u0001\u0001c\u0015c\u0015a\u0006।\u001e\u0007 \u0007   \u0014\u0005\u0001\r4\u0005\u0005\b\u0001\u0014\b\u0012 ू\u0003D\u0012 \b\tC\u0015\u0001॥ \u0007\u001e\u0017 २G   teṣu vyaktassa bhagavān idaṁ yogyeṣu siddhaye|   prakāśayatyatonyeṣu yo'rthassamupapadyate||  24   śivodgīrṇaṁ idaṁ jñānaṁ mantramantreśvareśvaraiḥ|   kāmadatvātkāmiketi pragītaṁ bahuvistaram||  25 Lord Mahesvara instructed the Agamas to those Mantras and Mantra Mahesvaras in whom high perfection was in its fullness enabling them to be fit enough for the transmission of the Agamas and who were intent on attaining the celebrated beatific state comprising both the enjoyment(bhoga) and further upliftment (sreyas). For those who were with less spiritual perfection, He revealed the scriptures befitting their level of perfection (such as Kapila Sastra and others). As said before, this Agama is the one which has come down from Lord Siva. It was transmitted in various ways to various competent high souls by Mantresvaras and Mantra Mahesvaras. Because of its supreme efficacy in granting the desired fruits and supreme goals, this Scripture is significantly called Kamika. This Kamika was revealed very elaborately and extensively to Anantesvara and other Lords existing in the Pure Path(suddha adhva).   \u0012\u0010H\t\u0003 w\u0010\b\u0012\u0005]\u0005]D\u0001\rि\u0001\u0006।\u0007>+   \r\r\u0005\t\u0001\u0005\f\b\u0012\u0001 (#ॐa\u001c\t(\bu\u0012a\u0006॥ +>>\u001e  २Q"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"   \u0012ऽ\u0005H\b\f \b\tC\u0015 \b#4\u0005 (ऽa:\u0005\u0015\u00053 \t\u00055\u0014a\u0006।\u001e=>   \tm \b\u0019\u0015\u0005\u0014] &\u0005\u0019 \u0012rSa\u0015\t \u001c%(\u0005॥ \u0007 \u001e \u001e \u0007+=  २V   tebhyo'vagamya dṛgjyotirjvālālīḍhamadadrumaḥ|   dadāvumāpatirmahyaṁ sahasrairbhavasammitaiḥ||  26   tatrā'pi vistaraṁ hitvā sūtraissārārtha vācakaiḥ|   vakṣye nirākulaṁ jñānaṁ taduktaireva bhūyasā||  27 Lord Umapati who set the tree of Manmatha to be engulfed by the flames of fire emitted from His forehead eye received this Agama from Anantesvara.

Lord Srikantha Paramesvara who is the Lord of the world, first quintessentially expressed through one verse the import of the Scripture in which three categories – Pati, pasu and pasa – have been explained under four divisions(carya, kriya, yoga and jnana); subsequently, he explained it in an elaborated way.   \",45\b6\b\u00147\u000b \b\u0014\u0004\u00068\u0016 \b\u0016\u00059:\u001a।&/   \r\u0017\u001f \u000b\r\u0004\r;\u0013 <:\u0005 0\u0014\u0012\u0016 \b#॥ && \u001c \u001c  ३   jagajjanmasthitidhvaṁsa tirobhāva vimuktayaḥ|   kṛtyaṁ sakārakaphalaṁ jñeyamasyaitadeva hi||  3 Creation, sustenance, dissolution, obscuration and bestowal of grace which results in the ultimate liberation – all these are the five functions of the supreme Lord Siva who is associated with Saktis which serve as His instruments and body and who is holding the fruits in the form of enjoyments(bhogas) and liberation(moksha).

Since the bonds(pasas) are inert, they themselves could not have come to exist. So there should be a supreme Lord who is eternally self-existent, having no causal source for Him. If such a source could be admitted, then it would lead to infinite regress. Or, the liberation should occur without any reason or effort, since all become equalized.

It is heard so through an all-knowing authority. But, in spite of its pervasive nature, the caitanya does not evidently manifest in the souls. So it is deduced that it should have been veiled or obstructed by something else. In this way the soul’s veiled state is well ascertained. Therefore, upto the time of removal of this veiling factor, this soul is dependent on Isvara who is with unobstructed power and prowess.   ू\u0016\u0017\u0014S!W\u0013 \r\u0005 \u0005:\r: )\u0014\b\u0016X\u0005।\u001c.\u001d\u001d/\u000f   \u0003!\"\u0013 \u000b\u0005\u000b\t X\u0005& \u001c\u001d \tY0\u0016 \rS\b\u0014\u0014\u001a॥ \u001d  Z   prāvṛtīśabale karma māyākāryaṁ caturvidham|   pāśajālaṁ samāsena dharmā nāmnaiva kīrtitāḥ||  7 By virtue of its nature of veiling the caitanya of the souls, anava mala is also known as avarana(covering, obscuring, screening).

But, since this Agama has been revealed by Paramesvara who transcends the limitations and incapacitated nature effected in the souls by the bonds and who is with the power of all-knowing and all-doing, the concepts set forth in the Supreme Scriptures(Agamas) stands always unexcelled and irrefutable."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"   \u0016\u0012bj\r U\u0016I \b)\u0012\b)k\b9 \u0013\b\u0007\u0014\u001a।\u001c \u001c \u001c   ू\b\u0014<\u0005ऽ U\u0016\u0012 \b\tJ:\u001a \b\r\bQWl\t\u001a॥ & \u001c &  १२   \u0010\u0011 ू\u0005\u000e \u0014ऽ&I ू\u0005:P& ू\u0003`\u0014।\u001c \u001c   :ऽ0\u0014m8: \u0014ऽ )\u0014n:\u0005\b\u0003 \b6\u0014\u0005॥ &/\u000f  १३   vedānteṣveka evātmā cidacidvyakti lakṣitaḥ|   pratijñāmātraṁ evedaṁ niścayaḥ kinnibandhanaḥ||  12   atha pramāṇaṁ tatrātmā prameyatvaṁ prapadyate|   yatraitadubhayaṁ tatra catuṣṭayamapi sthitam||  13 “The one and the only self is seen projected as the intelligent and the non-intelligent. The visible world in all its entirety of moveable and immovable exsitents is this self only. Apart from this supreme self, nothing exists.” So say the followers of Vedanta. This view is untenable. Without giving due consideration to the knowledge gained by reasoning(upapatti) and the contrary of that(anupapatti), this view may be accepted as mere propostion(prima facie). What authentic means is there to ascertain this proposition through reason and example? If it be said that there is scriptural testimony to validate this view, then, is that scripture the self or different from the self? If it is different from the self, then it is non-existent and therefore it cannot be a pramana. If it be one with the self, then there is the inconsistency of one and the same thing serving as pramana(which proves) and prameya(which is proved).

Or, if it be said that there is no such scriptural authority, then there is no valid proof for this advaitic view. Since there is no karmic effect in the form of merit and demerit apart from the one and the only self, there should be equal enjoyments(bhogas) to all the individual souls. But this is not seen. Moreover, if absorption into the Supreme Self is considered to be the liberation, such liberation does not prevail since the re-appearance of cit and acit is seen. If there is no liberation, then all the ordained means and practices and the scriptures which explain them become purposeless. If the Supreme Self is considered to be the material cause also, then He should be both cit and acit. But, both darkness and light cannot exist simultaneously in one and the same place. Therefore, in view of all these defects and contradictions, the non-dual self cannot be accepted.   \u000bc<\tA\b\u0003 \b\u0005qP& \r: \r\u0004\u000e \u0016\u0017\b?\u0014\u001a।\u001cB   \u0010\r\u0014\u00178\u0016r\u00069J >\u0014s\u0012O\b)i\u0014\u001a॥ \u001d/  १N "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"  sāṅkhyajñāne'pi mithyātvaṁ kārye kāraṇa vṛddhitaḥ|   akartṛbhāvādbhoktuśca svātantryādapyacidvataḥ||  15 Even the knowledge gained through the treatises of Sankhya system is to be considered as untruth, since they observe causal state even in the effected products.

If it is said that it is ‘sat’(existent) in the form of jiva before the embodied state and ‘asat’(non-existent) while in the embodied state, then it affirms our own view of the soul and it becomes a case of ‘siddha sadhana’(ascertaining the opposite view). Otherwise, in this state, even their concept of ‘syadvada’ becomes acceptable. There does not occur any inconsistency in their state. They maintain the view that the self is non-pervasive due to the fear that if the self is pervasive, then there would occur the intermixture of karmic effects. How could it be that an entity which was not pervasive earlier becomes pervasive at a later stage? If it be said that the soul is associated with the qualities such as getting unfolded at a particular satge , then the soul should be considered to be in the continuing stream of defects. In the embodied state, the pervasive nature of the souls is obstructed by the beginningless veiling impurity and it becomes pervasive in the state of liberation since the obstruction is completely removed. Since they are ignorant of this view, they are considered as ‘those who have not known the truth’(ajanins). Therefore, their‘syadvada’ cannot be accepted.   _\u0012\u0011 \u0003\b\u0004<\t\t \b\u0005q<\t \b\t\u0016\u0014\u0014।\u001d\u001d\u000f& \u001c   \u0004,i_K \u0005\u0005P& ) \u0014\bi!_ ,\u000e3\u0014\u001a॥ \u001c\u001c/  २२   ब\u0005!\u0006 \b\u0016\b\t\u0016\u0014b \u0012#\u000b:\u0006,\" :\u0014\u001a।\u001d\u001c \u001c &   \u000b \u0005\b9\"\u0014 G\u0003 \u0014\u0014\u0006 \u00059ँ!\u0016\u0006 \t \b\r\u0005॥ //\u001d\u000f २३   ṣaṭpadārtha parijñānān mithyājñānaṁ nivartate|   rāgadveṣau mamatvaṁ ca tadviśeṣa guṇāstataḥ||  22   kramaśo vinivartante dehasaṁyogajā yataḥ|   sā muktirjaḍatā rūpā tato muktaśśavo na kim||  23 “Through the knowledge of six categories – dravya, guna, karma, samanya, visesha and samanvaya – ignorance is removed; consequently, other vices such as attachment, aversion, ego, mine-ness and others get removed. Buddhi(intellect), sukha(pleasure), duhkha(pain), will(iccha), alienation(dvesha), effort (prayatna), merit(dharma), demerit(adharma), samskara(lingering impressions) – all these nine qualities of the soul occur in due order in the embodied state. Since all these are removed as soon as the body gets annihilated, such cessation of bodily existence itself is liberation.” These are the views proposed by the system formulated by Kanada. This kind of liberation is, indeed, of the nature of inertness(jadatva), since the presence of knowledge is not seen there. It becomes equalized with the state of being a corpse. Therefore, even these views are not acceptable.

If consciousness itself is momentary, the experience of meritorious and sinful effects and the remembrance of previous experiences cannot occur. Because, consciousness which occurs at one moment perishes at the next moment itself. How could the effect of karmas done by one man be experienced by another man? Or, how could the experience attained by one man be remembered by another man? Because of the ascertained occurrence of the karmic effects and remembrance, it is to be deduced that the self is essentially eternal; not momentary. There is another defect in the concept of momentariness of the self. Can the occurrence of uninterrupted continuity of momentary-self be considered as liberation? Or, can the pacified and stilled state of consciousness itself after knowing the object, just like the extinguished beam of lamp, be considered as the state of liberation? If it is the case of former, then, even in the state of liberation, the continuity of the momentary self frequently gets destroyed. If it is the case of latter, then, there is no experience of bliss in the extinguished state of the self. Therefore, when compared to this kind of blissless liberation, ‘to be enmeshed in the transmigratory phenomena’ is more preferable ;more superior.

Cannot this equanimity of mind be considered as the fitting indication for the desire to attain liberation? Why another symptom ‘saktipata’ should be considered as the proper indication? If this be asked, that equanimity of mind could be a sufficient indication for those who are in the pursuit of systems other than Saiva Siddhanta. Indeed, there are differentiations in the liberated states characterized by the power of wielding the authority. These differentiations are due to the differentiations prevailing in the process of diksha and due to the differences in the means(upaya). The attainment of the state of Mantramahesvaras, of the state of Mantresvaras and of the state of Rudras are of the supreme, medium and lower category respectively. For those who are fit enough to attain each of these three states, there should occur these symptoms mentioned above, in addition to the equanimity of mind characterized by two factors – to remain unaffected by joy and to remain unaffected by sorrow. So, these symptoms of ‘saktipata’ are considered to be essential.

It is well observed that even this body is non-intelligent. So, it is deduced that the created things are for the use of another existent. Since this body and other objects such as those in the earth and so forth are for the sake of another entity, it is inferred that the soul is different from the body. If it be said that body itself is of the nature of intelligence, that is untenable. Since it is well observed that the body is that which is experienced , that which undergoes modifications and that which is ever in cyclic transmigration, it cannot be intelligent. Things which are experienced and which sustain modifications are seen to be inert, like the objects such as cloth and others. It may be argued: “Since upon the coordinated action of the four elements – earth, water, fire and air- consciousness arises in a body and in the absence of such coordinated presence of these four elements, consciousness is not seen in the body; so the body, beyond doubt, is intelligent only”. Such argument does stand to reason, since intelligence is not observed in the dead body in which there does prevail the aggregate presence of these four elements. So it is ascertained that the body is not intelligent. “The elements frequently undergo changes right from the childhood. Except the change into a dead body, in all other changes knowledge is seen in the body. So, body is intelligent”. If it be argued in this way, it is not true. In that case, since the body itself differs very frequently from its previous state, there cannot be the remembrance of previous experiences.

There is nothing improbability in bestowing grace upon the intelligent beings and the inert things at one and the same time.

Whatever action is being done by Lord Siva or Sakti, is indeed an effective and unfailing help to the souls. It cannot be considered otherwise.

Grace is indeed the compassionate function of making the potencies of the bonds to ripe enough. What is the effect of such function, it may be asked. When the potency of mala is on its removal phase along with the preponderant state of obscuring the soul, the Tirodhana Sakti also sets Itself on the phase of removal and incessantly assumes the form of grace.

At this stage, Anantesvara creates raga tattva(from the kala tattva) in order to instill the sense of intention and desire in the soul.   * \u001a\u0018 \f\u0007i\u001a3 $3j\t \u000e\u0005\u001e\u000e*\u000e\u0007I k\u0019)\u0018।(\u0014\u000f   l\b! \u0018 $i\u0006(\u001f\u00183 \u0007\u0015\f\u0006\u0017\u000e\u0007\u001d\u0017m\u0006\u0007\u001a॥  १२   P\u0007\u001a ू\u0015\u0019!\u001b \u0004\f\rE\u001b \u0004\u0006\t\u0006cnEQ$V\u0015\u0018E\u001b।   $3\u0017$\u0007\u000e@ \u0018\u0006 $o $3\u0017\u0006\u0018 \u0004\u0006\u0005\u0006\u0018\u0015\u0007\u001a\u0018\u001b॥ '\u001f \u001f\u001f(\u000f १३   sa tena rañjito bhogyaṁ malīmasamapi spṛhan|   ādatte na ca bhuñjāno virāgamadhigaccāti||  12   iti pravṛttaḥ karaṇaiḥ kāryārūḍhaissabhauvanaiḥ|   bhogabhūmiṣu nā bhuṅkte bhogān kālānuvartinaḥ||  13 "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In spite of being impure, the soul, which has now been infused with the sense of desire eagerly experiences various kinds of enjoyments.

Raga tattva is that which, being the one which enables to enjoy, creates intense desire towards that enjoyment. Avairagya is concerned with the external objects. Raga tattva is concerned with the internal desire. If these two are one, then, as long as there is the object of enjoyment, there should be desire.

Karma is responsible only for the bodies, instruments and so forth but it cannot create desire which is the product of raga tattva. But, in that case, let aversion(dvesha) also be a different tattva like the raga tattva. If it be argued so, no, aversion cannot be a separate and different tattva. Aversion is only a specific mode of perseverance effected by the raga tattva; it cannot be a separate tattva. “Since raga tattva and dvesha(aversion) are mutually opposed, they cannot exist in one and the same location.” If this be said so, no; they can exist so, because raga and dvesha do not occur simultaneously in one and the same location.

Agitated sound like ‘saka saka’ is present in the air; blazing sound like ‘dhaka dhaka’ is present in the fire; spreading sound like ‘cala cala’ is present in the water; rough sound like ‘khada khada’ is present in the earth.

What is that ‘another place’? If it is said that the sound appears in the ear-space, then how has the quality of space appeared there? It may be said that it appears there, since the ear-space is also considered as the locus of the sound. But, in this regard, the actual worldly phenomenon is the valid testimony. ‘Sounds originate in this drum, in this lute...’ - such statement is very often heard. So, even the drum, lute and such others are the locations for the origination of the sound. But, again it may be argued that the sound manifests at times even in the ear-drum(srotra mula). Then, even in that place, let the sound manifest in a modified form!

Those who have known well the logical significance maintain that a reason or a view which is falsified and refuted cannot prove the intended proposition. It has been told in all the Agamas that the sound manifests in all the elements. Even perceptually it is observed that the sound, apart from the space and in addition to the space, appears in all other four elements. The demonstration which runs counter to this actual phenomenon does not stand to reason. “Just as the fragrance of flowers manifests at a long distance, after leaving behind its own source , even so the sound manifests in another place, after leaving behind its source and locus.” If it be argued so, then , in that case, it has to be conceived that even the smell is the quality of space.

In the south of Meru , there are three great mountains which are the foremost among the mountains. They are: Nishadha, Hemakuta and Himavan. In the north side of the meru, there are three great mountains – Nila, Sveta and Srunga. These mountains are with a width of 2000 yojanas and a height of 10,000 yojanas. The mid-space between these mountains measures 9000 yojanas. Lengthwise, they are extending towards east and west up to the salty ocean, holding within them prospering lands known as ‘varshas’. There are two great mountains, one in the east of the Meru and the other in its west. They are with a width of 1000 yojanas and a height of 2000 yojanas. The mountain in the east is known as ‘Malyavan’ and the mountain in the west is known as ‘gandhamadana’. Lengthwise, they are extending towards north and south. Covering the stretch of land which is not occupied by the Nishadha and others and the varshas, these mountains in the east and the west are extending lengthwise up to 34,000 yojanas.

A river originating from the juice of the fruits of Jambu-tree flows continuosly in clockwise direction around the Meru and having transformed the land-stretch to be of the nature of gold, enters into the ground at the bottom of the Meru. Having drunk the juicy water of that river, the birds, snakes, rats, deers, monkeys and other animals become gold colored. Likewise, all those who take a swim or bath in that river become golden hued. Because of such greatness of the Jambu-tree, the jambudvipa has attained the status of being the Flag-island(Dvipaketu) among the Dvipas. Even though there are other kalpa-trees such as kadamba and others in this island, this island has attained the significant name ‘Jambudvipa’ because of the greatness and astonishing features of the jambu-tree.   ू\u000fy\u000f) \u0011\u0016 3P E B\u001b .Pऽ\b\f) \u0016\u0017॥\u000b  RR   \u0012\b\r4_\t\r\u0018\u0007) \u0017\u000f $ऽ !\u000fu\u001b \u0011'($।\u000b"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"   \u001e\u000f³\u000f\u0011ि B\u001b ,\u0016\u0010 \u0012\b\u0011\u00125\u000f¿\b\r\u00169$॥\u0019)  RU   \u0017 ̄\u0017) \u000f\u0017\u0012) $ऽ \u0012\b\r \u000f\u0017\u0012 $¥\b।\u000b   \u0016Pॅ\u000fH) \u0016P1 \u0019\u001b B\u001b \u0011\u0012$\r\u00186 ॑\u0018\rd\u001f॥  R\\   \u0018\u0016P\u0011\u0017J<$\u001b \u001b \u001b\u0010 c\u001f \u0007 P\b3 ́\u0015P\u001f।)\u0019   \u0012F1\u000f\"k \u001c\u0011$c\u000f9 \u0007\u000f\u0017\u0017) \u0015ि\u0007\r ॑\u0018\u001f॥  U०   \u0012F,\u0011\u0007\u000fvH\u0011c\u001f\u0019 \u0012<$\u001b \u001b \u00111$9\u0011\u0015l\u0018\u000f।   prācyāṁ viṣkambha śailasya mūle caitrarathaṁ vanam||  77   saro'ruṇodakaṁ nāma tatra hemābja maṇḍitam|   yāmyādri mūle gandharva surasiddhāpsarovṛtaṁ||  78   nandanaṁ mānasaṁ tatra saro mānasa taskaram|   vaibhrājaṁ vaipule mūle sitodaśca hradottamaḥ||  79   devairniṣevyate cchannaḥ kamalairaṁśumatprabhaiḥ|   saupārśve dhṛtimannāma kānanaṁ bhadrako hradaḥ||  80   saugandhikāmbujacchinnaḥ sevyate pitṛbhissadā| At the bottom of the supportive mountain(vishkambha) in the east, there is a pleasure-garden called ‘Caitra Ratha’.

Hailing from the lineage of Manu, there was a king by name Agnidhra and was ruling over the Jambudvipa. Nine sons were born to him. He entrusted the rulership of these nine varshas with his nine sons. Cosequently, these varshas were called after the names of his sons.

The extent of the Jambudvipa is one hundred thousand yojanas. The extent of Sakadvipa is twice the extent of the Jambu. Likewise, the extent of each succeeding dvipa is twice the extent of the preceding dvipa. The extent of each ocean gets doubled, in the same way. In the Sakadvipa, there is a tree known as Saka, towering to a great height. Because of such significant tree, this island is called Sakadvipa. When Brahma commenced a sacrifice(yajna) in the next island, there appeared a special kind of kusa-grass having the golden color. Because of such special kind of kusa-grass, the island came to be known as Kusadvipa. In the Krauncadvipa, there was a mountain known as Kraunca. Kraunca, who was the king of asuras and who was terrorizing and tormenting the Devas through his deceitful means of war was killed instantly by Skanda, the wielder of Maya, in the golden cave of the Kraunca mountain. The Kraunca mountain belonging to that asura king was pierced with the lance of Skanda and this incidence became widely known. Since that incidence, the Kraunca became a symbol of that island. So that island came to be known as Krauncadvipa.   3\u000f \u001b 3\u000f\u0011 \u00169/\r\u0010 !Pl\u000f!\u0011ॐ\u0007\r4\u0007\u0015\u000f\u001f।\u0010   \u0011ू\u001e\r4\b\u000f\t\u000f) $7$l\u001b\u0019 $\u0018\u000fs\u000f\u0011\u0017V\u0017॥\u000b १०२   ,\r\u0018\u001b \u001b ,\r1\u0011$\u0017\u000f\u0010 \b\u000fH\u000f\u0015{\r\u0012\u0016\rf$\u001f।B   \u001e\u000fË\r4\u0015Q\u0011©\u0007 ̧\u000f\u0017\u000fB) Ì$É\u000f\u0017\u000f) \u0017\r\u001f \u0007 ॥\u0019\u001b १०३   \u0012 $J\u001b\u0019 !\u0011\b\u001e+\u000f\u001e ू\u00169dJ\u001b\u0019 \u00159,\u0017B\u000b ,Æ\u0017।\u0019\u000b   \u0016ो\u001b $) ,F$\u001f \u0007\r1\u000f$\u000b \u000431~\r,Î\u001e॥\u000b १०४   \u001e+\u0016\u000f^\rE $\u000f ,\u000f\u0016\r \u0018A\u001c\u000f\u001f \u0007\r1\u000f\u0011[\u0017\u000f \u0017\u001f।\u0019\u001b   $±\u0018\u0012\u000f\u001b !% c\u000f ,\r\u0018l\u001b $$\r4\u0015\u0016$॥\u000b १०G   śālmale śālmalirvṛkṣo haimassāhasriko'rkabhāḥ|   priyo'marāṇāṁ tatketussa tadākhyānibandhanam||  102   gomede gopatirnāma rājābhūdgosavodyataḥ|   yājyo'bhūdvahnikalpānāṁ autathyānāṁ manoḥ kule||  103   sa teṣu hariyajñāya pravṛtteṣu bhṛgūn gurūn|"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"  vavre taṁ gautamaḥ kopāt aśapatsogamatkṣayam||  104   yajñavāṭosya tā gāvo dagdhāḥ kopāgninā muneḥ|   tanmedasā mahī cchannā gomedassa tato'bhavat||  105 In the island known as Salmali, there is ‘salmali’ tree, with its branches in gold color , with a height of 1000 yojanas and with the resplendence of the sun.

In the island called Gomeda, there was a king by name Gopati. When he arranged for the performance of a special sacrifice known as ‘gosava’, his Guru called Gautama who hailed from the lineage of Utathya born as the descendant of Manu went to the place of Indra to invite him to accept the ‘havis’. Meanwhile, Gopati invited Guru Bhrugu to be present in the sacrifice and started the proceedings of the yajna. On his return, Gautama saw the presence of Bhrugu, got angered and cursed the king.

That river is called Puskarini. Because of the importance of this river, this island came to be known as Pushakrini and it is resorted to by the celestial beings. Just as the people living in the eight varshas – Kimpurusha and others – situated in the Jambudvipa do not get affected by the changes and deviations which occur according to the change of the yugas, even so the people living in the Saka and other islands do not get affected by those changes and deviations tuned to the changes of the yugas. They are taking milk and such other drinks and vegetables available in each island, for their food. Starting from the Saka and ending with Puskarini, the complexion of the people living there is repectively: frost, moonlight, snow, blue-lotus, grain and crystal. They live for 10,000 years, being completely free from miseries and distress.

Lord Sadasiva, being associated with 38 kalas such as Tara, Sutara and others, exists in His own plane, performing the fivefold cosmic function - creation and others. Even this fivefold cosmic function is performed by Him simply by His will. Otherwise, He is always in formless state(nishkala) when He is not involved in the performance of fivefold cosmic function. Pruthvi, Prakruti, Maya, Suddhavidya, nine Kalas of bindu and nada – all these are declared to be the locations characterized by the sate of bondage. Some say that Indhika and Dipika which are below the plane of Rocika, the four kalas of the bindu, suddhavidya, maya, prakruti and pruthvi – all these ten locations are characterized by the state of bondage. Some others declare that the ten locations - nine kalas of the bindu and the nada and suddhavidya – denote the state of bondage. It should be known well that all the locations which are below the plane of the nada-kalas are the places fitting the bound state, since they are the impediments which obstruct the souls which are advancing to reach the ultimate transcendental plane of Lord Siva. The locations of Gahanesa and other Rudras are in the plane which is above the plane of kala-tattva and below the plane of maya-tattva. The extent of the space between the kala-tattva and the maya-tattva should be known in an implied way, excercizing one`s own power of knowledge, since it has been declared that the maya is infinitely extensive. For both the impure path and the pure path, the worlds of which have been created in the order explained before, dissolution occurs in an order contrary to the order of creation.

Even the creation takes place at two levels. Since the time of existence precedes the time of dissolution, the duration of existence is explained first. Listen to this exposition. The duration of four yugas(caturyuga) – kruta, treta, dvapara and kali – makes one unit of time. A cycle of one thousand ‘caturyugas’ is considered as the daytime of Brahma and the same duration is the night of Brahma. In this way, 2000 caturyugas make one day of Brahma. Three hundred and sixty ‘brahma-days’ make one ‘brahma-year’. At the lapse of one parardha of such ‘brahma-years’, the secondary dissolution(avantara pralaya) takes place for the worlds of the impure path(asuddha adhva), in the reverse order of creation. At that time, the one hundred Rudras, Virabhadra,Srikantha, Krodhesa, Canda, Samvarta and other Lords who are maintaining the worlds of the impure path would continue to exist, keeping under their possession the worlds which are now in the subtle form being absorbed into their respective causes and the souls which are associated with their own karmic impulses and with subtle body constituted of the tattvas from pruthvi to kala and which are in the prakruti. They would be existing till the completion of the primary dissolution. Subsquently, at the beginning of the next intermediate creation, Anantesvara, being commissioned and directed by Lord Siva, would prompt and direct Srikantha and other Rudras to create the worlds of the impure path in the same order as adopted before. These Rudras, having created the worlds from their respective sources, would be wielding their authority over these worlds.   \u0007\u0010 \u001c\u000f\u0011\u0018\u0007\u0010) $° ,\t;\u001b\u0017\u0019 $F \u0011-$॥\u000b  १UL   ,\u0011\t\u0017\r\u0019 \u0017 ,\t\r41P\u0011$\u0019 ू\u00079$\u000f\u0016y$\u0019\u001b \u0007\f।\u000b   karma dharmādikaṁ tacca guṇatvena matau sthitam||  186   guṇino na guṇo'paiti prakṛtāvucyate katham| Bharadvaja: Just now it was said that the karmic impulses are absorbed into prakruti-tattva at the time of intermediate dissolution.

It is the para-nada which is very subtle and unmanifest that turns into five categories – kala, kaala, raga, vidya and purusha – and assumes the name ‘panca kala’ and attains the state of manifest-nada(sthula nada). Bindu, becoming the base for the four knots of bonds – avyakta, guna, buddhi and ahankara – assumes the specific name ‘catushkala’. So it is to be noted that the mind and organs are in the ahankara-tattva(now absorbed into bindu) and the ‘bhavas’ and ‘pratyayas’ are in the buddhi-tattva absorbed into the bindu.

The full competency to recite and to employ these siva-mantras is gained through ‘siva-diksha’ which is going to be explained in the sequel.
