The heart of modern Kashmir is, as it was in the past, the wideand fertile valley of the river Vitasta. Set at an altitude of five thousandfeet, the valley's beautiful lakes and temperate climate nowadays attracttourists in large numbers during the summer months when temperaturesrise high into the forties Centigrade on the North Indian plains. Althoughmost of the population is at present Muslim, before the advent of Islam inthe thirteenth century, Kashmir enjoyed an unparalleled reputation as acentre of learning amongst both Buddhists and Hindus. Kashmirisexcelled not only in religious studies but also in the secular fields ofSanskrit literature, literary criticism and grammar as well as the sciences,including medicine, astronomy and mathematics. They had a uniquelyrealistic sense of history clearly evidenced in Kalhana's twelfth centurychronicle of the kings of Kashmir, the Rqjataranginl, which is virtuallythe only history of its kind in India.Remarkable as Kashmir has been as a seat of Hindu spiritualityand learning, it was no less so as a centre of Buddhism. Possiblyintroduced into Kashmir as early as the third century B.C., Buddhismhad already developed there to such a degree by the first century of our erathat the Kushan king, Kaniska, chose Kashmir as the venue of a majorBuddhist Council. It was a huge gathering, attended by more than five"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONhundred Buddhist monks and scholars. The previously uncodifiedportions of the Buddha's discourses and the theoretical portion of thecanon (the Abhidharma) were codified and the rest extensively revised.The entire early canon, the Tripifaka, was then inscribed on copperplates and deposited in a stupa. In the centuries that followed most formsof Indian Buddhism flourished in Kashmir. Of the early schools theSarvastivada was particularly well developed. Similarly, the schools ofthe Great Vehicle, both those of the Middle Way and the idealist Yogacara,were taught and practiced extensively. Kashmir also produced many fineBuddhist logicians in the line of Dirinaga and Dharmaklrti, amongstwhom Vinltadeva and Dharmottaracarya, who lived in the eighth century,are the most famous.The borders of Kashmir at that time extended further west beyondthe roads to Asia which ran through the Swat and Chitral valleys inGilgit. For this reason Kashmir was the first to make a substantialcontribution to the spread of Buddhism in Central Asia, which beganabout the fourth century A.D. and travelled along these routes. ManyBuddhists, attracted by Kashmir's reputation, came from distant landsto learn Sanskrit and train as translators and teachers. One of the earliestand most brilliant was Kumarajiva (334-413 A.D.). Born into anaristocratic family of the Central Asian kingdom of Khotan, he came toKashmir in his youth and learnt there the scriptures of the Great Vehiclefrom Bandhudatta. He then went to China, where he lived and workedfor the rest of his life, translating Buddhist scriptures. The KashmiriBuddhabhadra, his contemporary, did the same. Yoga teachers likeDharmabhiksu attracted a large number of Chinese and Kashmiristudents at the end of the fifth century when there was a growing foreigninterest in Buddhist Yoga. It was also during this period that the KashmiriBuddhasena translated a major work of the idealist Buddhist Yogacaraschool—the Yogacarabhumi—into Chine.se for the first time. In631 A.D., Hsiian Tsang, one of China's most famous Buddhist pilgrims,came to study in Kashmir leaving us an account of his two-year staywhich eloquently testifies to Buddhism's popularity and influence.Such was Kashmir's reputation that it was from here that Tibetoriginally chose to receive its religion. The first king of Tibet, Srong-bcan-sgampo, sent Thon-mi Sambhota to Kashmir during the reign ofDurlabhavardhana (616 A.D.). He learnt Sanskrit from Devatltasimhaand returned to Tibet with a modified thirty-letter version of theKashmiri script.1 Kashmir continued to play a role in the transmissionof Buddhism from India into Tiber although other routes (particularlythrough Nepal) later became more important. By the eleventh century,when the Kashmiri Saiva schools were reaching the peak of their"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction  3development, Kashmir was also, as Tucci says, \"one of the places whereBuddhism prospered most, even if not as state religion, certainly as thehome of the greatest scholars and exegetes of the time.\"2The rich spiritual and intellectual climate of Kashmir helped tofoster an important and far reaching development that affected everyaspect of Indian religious life, namely, Tantra. About the middle of thefirst millennium of our era, Tantra began to assume a clearly defined,although immensely varied, identity through the emergence of vastcorpuses of sacred literature that defined themselves specifically asTantric. There can be no doubt, despite the fragmentary and as yetpoorly researched evidence, that Kashmir was an important centre of awide range of Tantric cults, both Hindu and Buddhist. Many famousBuddhist Tantric teachers lived in or near Kashmir at that time. Naropaand even Padmasambhava (who is said to have introduced TantricBuddhism into Tibet) sometimes figure in Tibetan sources as Kashmiris.3Ua'tfiyana (Tibetan: U-rgyan), important as Padmasambhava's birth-place and as a major centre of Tantric Buddhism and Hinduism, maywell have been located in the nearby Swat valley.Both of Tantra's major Hindu streams, one centred on the worshipof Visnu and the other on Siva, evolved a bewildering number of Tantriccults, some large others small. Kashmir contributed substantially tothese developments not only on the Saiva side but also on the Vaisnava.Indeed, the earliest known references drawn from Vaisnava Tantricsources are found in the writings of Kashmiris.4 Nowadays the form ofVaisnavism that looks to these scriptures as authoritative, namely, thePancaratra, survives only in South India; however, the earliest Southernteachers of this school looked to Kashmir as one of their oldest seats oflearning and spiritual culture.5 But although the worship of Visnu,whether performed according to the norms prescribed by the Tantrasor otherwise, was certainly an important feature of Kashmiri religiouslife and was patronised extensively by the Hindu kings of the valley,even so, Saivism remained, on the whole, the dominant form of Hinduism.The Saivism of Kashmir and Kashmiri SaivismWe know very little of the origins of Saivism in Kashmir, althoughtradition testifies to its antiquity in this part of India. The writtenrecords confirm that it has always occupied an important place in thereligious life of Kashmir. Thus Kalhana records (possibly from earlierchronicles) the existence of an already ancient temple dedicated toSiva in emperor Asoka's time. Although this is hardly possible, as"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONtemples were not constructed in India as early as the third century B.C.,this reference illustrates the then6 common Kashmiri belief in Saivisrrfsancient presence in Kashmir.7 Certainly the many newly constructedtemples, as well as the old ones renovated throughout the period coveredin Kalhana's history, testify to Saivism's continuing popularity. In theearly ninth century A.D., when the first Kashmiri Saiva works werewritten, there were numerous Saiva groups in the valley of Kashmir.Amongst them were those that came to form a part of what we nowadayscall Kashmiri Saivism of which the Spanda school, whose teachingswe are concerned with here, was the first development.All these Saiva groups, diverse though they were, accepted the SaivaTantras (also known as Agamas) as their scriptural authority. Somegroups would look to one section of the Agamas, others to another.They thus ordered themselves quite naturally into lineages of Tantricmasters who initiated disciples into the rituals and other practices oftheir chosen Tantras. We know of the existence of these Tantric sub-cultures not only from epigraphic and other sources including otherHindu scriptures, particularly the Puranas, but also from the Agamasthemselves. Although the Agamas are all considered to be divinerevelation and hence, in a sense, eternal, they do nonetheless reflectthe growth of these Saiva groups for they not only studied them butalso contributed to them. Thus, one way in which we can understandhow these groups are related is to see how the Saiva Tantras have orderedthemselves in relation to one another. The brief account that followsof the Saiva canon8 will hopefully serve to indicate in broad terms howthe Saiva groups that have contributed to the formation of KashmiriSaivism are related to Tantric Saivism as a whole. According to animportant system of classification we find in the Agamas themselves,they can be divided into the following sections.Saivasiddhanta. The Agamas generally agree that there are twenty-eightprincipal Siddhantagamas and about two hundred Saiva scriptures(called Upagamas) affiliated to them.9 All the main Agamas, andmany of the secondary ones, are still extant in South India, althoughonly a relatively small number have as yet been edited from the manuscriptsources. The cults of these Agamas are largely concerned with theworship of Sadasiva which is generally conducted in public temples andis centred on the Linga, Sadasiva's phallic symbol. Descriptions of thetemples, Linga and iconic forms of the gods and goddesses of theSiddhanta constitute an important part of these Agamas. They alsodeal extensively with the rituals related to them. These include the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction  5regular daily rites as well as occasional ones such as consecrationceremonies and festivals. Other important rituals are those that concernthe initiation of the neophyte into this form of Saivism or the priesthood.The Agamas are primarily concerned with ritual and devote relativelylittle space to philosophical matters or even yoga. Even so, the philo-sophical standpoint of these Tantras can, broadly speaking, be saidto be a dualism of a more or less tempered form although not oneconsistently maintained throughout them. The homonymous philo-sophical school inspired by these Agamas, however, ultimately developeda well defined dualism, according to which there are three basic realities,namely, Siva (pati\\ the fettered soul (pasu) and the factors that bindit (pdsa). The Kashmiri Saiva tradition records that the founder ofdualist Saivism was called Amardaka. This name recurs in inscriptionsand other sources as that of an important founder figure believed to havelived in the eighth century. This Amardaka had predecessors and socannot really be said to have founded this branch of Saivism; even so,he is important as the founder of a major Siddhanta monastic centre(ma(ha). This centre, named Amardaka after its founder, was locatedin Ujjain. Purandara, Amardaka's successor, also founded a Siddhantaorder, namely, the Mattamayura. This order was named after thecapital of the Calukya empire in the Punjab where its headquarterswere located. A third important order was the Madhumateya foundedby Pavanasiva to which belonged the royal preceptors of the Kalacurikings of Central India.Siddhanta ascetics, full of missionary zeal, used the influence oftheir royal patrons to propagate their teachings in the neighbouringkingdoms, especially in South India. From the oldest capital of theCalukyas, Mattamayura, they established monasteries in Mahara§tra,the Konkan, Karnafaka, Andhra and Kerala. The Siddhanta flourishedin the areas where it spread, until it was devastated by the Musliminvasions, which started in the eleventh century, or supplanted byother forms of Hinduism. It survived, however, in South India whereit changed its medium of expression from Sanskrit to Tamil in whichform it is better known and persists to this day.10 Although Saiva-siddhanta survives at present only in South India, we know that anumber of the earliest commentators of the Agamas and importantauthors of independent works expounding the philosophy of theSiddhanta were Kashmiris.11 Monist Kashmiri Saiva12 authors quotethem with great reverence as their predecessors, although they do notalways agree with them. There can be no doubt that the Siddhantagreatly influenced Kashmiri Saivism which largely adopted it, reshapingit on non-dualist lines."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONBhuta and G&rwjla Tantras. These two groups of Agamas have beenalmost entirely lost. They are considered together as they appear tohave much in common. We know that both dealt with magical cures(particularly of snakebite), exorcism of malevolent ghosts and spirits,the protection of children from such entities as well as the acquisitionof magical powers and other such matters. References to these twogroups is common in the Siddhantagamas, and Kashmiri Saivites alsoknew of them although already at this time (viz., the ninth century A.D.onwards) they were clearly on the decline, at least in Kashmir.13The VGmatantras. According to the classification we are following in thisaccount, each group of Agamas constitutes a 'current' (srotas) ofscriptures spoken by one or other of Sadasiva's five faces. The Siddhantabelongs to the Upper current, spoken by the Upper face, while theBhuta and Garudatantras belong to the Western and Eastern currents.The Vamatantras were spoken by the Northern face. This face, locatedto the left of centre (which is in the eastern direction), is that of theleft-hand current, not to be confused with the Tantric distinctionbetween 'left' and 'right-hand' paths.The only Tantra belonging to this group that has been recoveredso far is the Vinasikhatantra recently edited from just two Nepalesemanuscripts by Dr. T. Goudriaan.14 Although this group of Tantras isregularly mentioned in the primary sources when they refer to theSaiva canon and its divisions, the cults associated with it seem to havehad little success in India and practically died out after the first millenniumof our era. The dominant form of Siva in these Tantras appears to havebeen Tumburubhairava.15 He is described as having four faces, eachone of which spoke one of the major Tantras of this group, namely, theTantra of the Severed Head (Sirascheda), the Tantra of the Crest of theVina (Vinafikha), the Tantra of Delusion (Saipmohana) and theTantra of the Higher Law (Nayottara).16These Tantras, and with them the cult of Tumburu, spread fromIndia to Southeast Asia sometime before the end of the eighth century.We know from a Cambodian inscription discovered at Sdok Kok Thorndated 1052 A.D. that these Tantras were known there at the time. Thisinscription commemorates the history of a lineage of royal priestsfounded by Sivakaivalya who was the priest of Jayavarman II whoreturned to Cambodia from exile in Java in 802 A.D.. At that time aBrahmin called Hiranyadama taught the four Tantras to Sivakaivalyaand several rites described in them were performed for the benefit ofthe king. We also find references to Tumburu in Sanskrit hymns andfragments from Bali, some of which go back to an early period of Hindu"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction   1influence in Indonesia.17 The absence of further reference to theseIantras and their cults in Southeast Asia seems to indicate that, ashappened in India, they did not survive much beyond the eleventhcentury. Similarly, although the Vamatantras were known in Kashmir,monistic Kashmiri Saivites clearly preferred the Siddhantagamas andthe Bhairavatantras to which we now turn.The Bhairavatantras. As their name suggests, the Bhairavatantraswere especially (but not exclusively) concerned with the worship ofBhairava. Bhairava is an important form of Siva known and worshippedthroughout India. He is popular both in the literate Sanskrit traditionas well as in many non-literate vernacular traditions. Bhairava, whosename literally means 'the Terrible One', is the 'wrathful', 'frightening'form of Siva Who is 'peaceful' and 'auspicious'. Abhinavagupta, animportant Kashmiri Saiva teacher (see below), explains the popularTantric etymology of the word Bhairava as follows:1) Bhairava is He Who bears all things and is supported by theuniverse, filling it and sustaining it on the one hand, while utteringit or conceiving it on the other.182) Bhairava is He Who protects those frightened by the roundsof rebirth.193) Bhairava is the One born in the heart of those who, terrifiedby transmigratory existence, call on Him for help.204) Bhairava is He Who arouses by His grace a fear of trans-migration.5) Bhairava is He Whose light shines in the minds of those yogiswho are intent on assimilating time (kalagrasa) into the eternal presenceof consciousness and thus exhaust the energy of time said to be thedriving force behind the machine of the galaxies.216) Bhairava is the Lord of the powers of the senses whose shouting(ravaria) frightens the souls in bondage.227) Bhairava is the Lord Who calls a halt to transmigration andthus is very terrible.23There are countless forms of Bhairava, each with their own name.A typical and widely-known form is that of Mahakalabhairava. Heis worshipped in major centres in India including Ujjain, Benares andKathmandu. He is the protector of these three cities. One could add,incidentally, that Mahakala is also an important Buddhist god and assuch is the guardian of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. He is describedas dark blue or black24 and fierce in appearance. He carries the skullof the creator-god, Brahma, as penance for having cut off his head to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONsave the world from its great heat generated within it by Brahma'spride.25 Bhairava's furious drunkenness and body aflame with the fireof cosmic destruction has served for centuries as an archetype of theliberated state for numerous Saiva cults. All these culls shared the viewthat liberation is essentially freedom from the opposites of good and evil;thus the adept who seeks it must break through them to a higher state ofexpanded, inebriated and blissful consciousness that, unaffected bythem, encompasses both.In the Kashmiri Saiva tradition, Bhairava is understood as thedivine form of the absolute realised as the exertive force (udyamd) thatdrives the senses and mind at the microcosmic level along with theuniverse at the macrocosmic level.26 Much of Kashmiri Saiva practice—particularly that of the Doctrine of Vibration with which this volumeis concerned—deals with how to lay hold of this inner power and identifywith it. One way is to arouse the spiritual and cosmic energy latent inthe soul through an expansion of consciousness brought about by theperformance of rituals and the practice of yoga. Unlike the rituals of theSiddhanta, which generally take place in public, many of these ritualswere originally performed in cremation grounds or lonely places for thebenefit of a few select initiates. Again, unlike the Siddhanta rituals,many of them involve the offering of meat and wine to the deity and,at times, ritual intercourse.The Bhairavatantras were not the only Tantras to advocate suchpractices. Moreover, they were numerous and of varied content andnot all of them considered these practices important. Thus a Bhairava-tantra well known to Kashmiri Saivites, the Svacchandabhairavatantra,allows such practices, but even so generally advocates 'tamer' proceduressimilar to the rituals of the Siddhantagamas. The Bhairavatantras areconventionally said to number sixty-four but must have been manymore. They were major sources for Kashmiri Saivites.Other Saiva Groups. Important precursors of the Agamic Saiva groupswere the Pasupatas. References to them are found in the earliestportions of the Mahabharata and in Patanjali's commentary on Panini'sgrammar written in the second century B.C. Unfortunately, we do notpossess any original scriptures of these early Saiva sects. The Pasupata-sutra, the only work we have, is relatively late although earlier than thetenth century A.D..27 It enjoins, amongst other things, that Pasupatasshould behave in a manner contrary to accepted norms. They shouldlaugh and cry like madmen, make lewd gestures at young women andabuse those that approach them. The aim was thereby to overcome theego and gain magical power through transgression. Those who behaved"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction  9in this way were the votaries of the Great Vow (mahavrata). Otherextremist Saiva sects that adhered to the Great Vow were the skull-bearing ascetics of the Kapalika order and other Saiva groups collectivelysaid to belong to the Higher Path (atimdrga).2*Other important Saiva groups are those of the Kaulas. In a sense,successors of the early extremist Saiva sects belonging to the HigherPath, these groups are closely affiliated to other Saivagamic groups,particularly those of the Bhairavatantras. They are very important inthe history of Kashmiri Saivism as it later developed extensively byintegrating into itself a number of Kaula systems, largely divested oftheir outer ritual forms. Monist in outlook, the original Tantras ofthese groups were, as were the Bhairava and Varnatantras, strongly Saktain tone. Although they remained essentially and consistently Saiva,they stressed the worship of female divinities. Thus they representthe precursors of the later Sakta Tantric tradition. Indeed the word'Kula' itself denotes the power of consciousness—Sakti, the GoddessWho is the emission (yisarga) of the absolute (called Akula), throughwhich the universe is created.29Amongst the many Kaula schools, the most important for KashmiriSaivites were these of the Krama and Trika. The Krama School isimportant because it deals with what were considered to be the mostsecret doctrines and practices of Kashmiri Saivism, namely, thoseinvolved in the worship of Kali. Basing itself on concepts alreadydeveloping in the original Tantras and the oral traditions associatedwith them, the Kashmiri Saiva Krama elevated the worship of Kalito a level beyond outer ritual. Ritual came to be understood as an innerprocess of realisation through which the initiate discovered his essentialidentity with Kali Who is the flow (krama) of the power of consciousnessthrough the polarities of subject, object and means of knowledge inconsonance with their arising and falling away in each act of perception.The experience of this process coupled with the arousing of man'sspiritual potential (kurujalini) and the expansion of consciousnessthat brings it about is the most esoteric practice of Kashmiri Saivism.The Kaula character of this school is evidenced by the fact that itadvocates the ritual consumption of meat and wine as well as ritualintercourse, as a possible means of developing this consciousness.Abhinavagupta and the Flowering of Trika SaivismIn order to complete our general survey of the forms of AgamicSaivism incorporated into Kashmiri Saivism, before we turn to those"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONschools that originated in the hands of monist Kashmiri Saivite philo-sophers, we turn now to that of the Trika and to Abhinavagupta whodeveloped and made of it the culmination of Kashmiri Saivism.Abhinavagupta lived in Kashmir from about the middle of the tenthcentury into the eleventh. He was, without a doubt, the most brilliantof the Kashmiri Saiva teachers and one of the greatest spiritual andintellectual giants India has produced. He wrote more than sixty works,some very extensive, and all remarkable for the beauty of their Sanskritand profundity of thought. His literary activity falls into three periods.In chronological order these are:301) Tantrika. This, the first period of Abhinavagupta's literary life,extends probably up to his early forties, and concerns us particularlyhere. In this period Abhinava sought in his writings to establish thesuperiority of Trika above all other schools of Agamic Saivism. Hismost important work during this period is the Light of the Tantras(Tantralokd). It is an extensive and difficult text in which he quotesfrom numerous Agamic sources belonging to all (or most) types knownin Kashmir. If not the most important, certainly one of the most importantworks of Tantric Hinduism, it reads as an exposition of Saivagamicritual and practice couched in the monistic philosophy of KashmiriSaivism (i.e., the Pratyabhijna). Abhinava's aim was to bring togetherthe major Saivagamic schools into that of Trika Saivism and in so doinghe has provided us with a unique account of Agamic Saivism, albeitfrom his point of view.2) Poetics and Dramaturgy. In the second period of his life Abhinavawrote important works in these fields. Indeed, it is for this contri-bution that he is best known. His commentary on the Nafyasastra, theforemost treatise in Sanskrit dramaturgy, is the only one preserved,a fact that testifies to its excellence and influence. Similarly, hiscommentary on Anandavardhana's Mirror of Suggestion (Dhvanyaloka)is justly famous. In this work Anandavardbana and Abhinavaguptaexpound the theory that the soul of poetry is its power of suggestionthrough which sentiment is conveyed to the reader.3) Philosophical. In the last period of his life Abhinava wrote extensiveand profound commentaries on Utpaladeva's Stanzas on the Recognitionof God (Isvarapratyabhijfiakarika). In these commentaries he elucidatesthe Doctrine of Recognition (pratyabhijna) which is the monisticphilosophy proper of Kashmiri Saivism to which we shall refer later."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction  11We know that Abhinavagupta was a Brahmin belonging to theAtrigotra and that his ancestors were distinguished scholars in thecourt of Kanauj. They were brought to Kashmir by King Lalitadityaabout the middle of the eighth century. Abhinava's grandfather wasVarahagupta and his father Narasimhagupta, also known as Cukhala.Despite the Vaisnava connotations of his father's name, he was anardent devotee of Siva. Abhinava refers to him reverently in severalplaces as the teacher who taught him, amongst other things, thefundamentals of Sanskrit grammar, logic and literature.31 His mother,for whom he had great affection, died when he was a child.32 Abhinavatook full advantage of the many Saiva Masters and teachers of otherbranches of learning who lived in Kashmir. Even in this, his formativeperiod, he shunned the company of the impious and so, as he tells us,\"lived a solitary life devoted to the quest for truth.\"33 When Abhinavawrote the Light of the Tantras (Tantrdloka) in his early middle age,he seems to have had just a small group of close disciples, almost allof whom were members of his family. He tells us that his brotherManoratha was one of the first to learn from him34 and that he was laterjoined by Kama, the husband of his sister Amba. Kama's prematuredeath, which left his wife alone with their only son, led her to devoteherself entirely to the worship of Lord Siva and the service of her brother.Kama's father was a minister who had left the court to become \"a ministerof the Lord.\"35 His sister, Vatsalika, was the aunt of Mandra, Kama'scousin and close friend. All these in-laws of Abhinava's sister weredevoted to him and served him faithfully. Thus Mandra invited him tostay in his town outside Pravarapura (modern Srinagar) where, in thehouse of Vatsalika, he wrote his Light of the Tantras for the benefit ofhis disciples who, Abhinava tells us at the end of his work, wanted togain \"a perfect knowledge of the Tantras.\"36 Almost ail the otherdisciples he refers to here were the sons of his paternal uncle. Amongstthem was one called \"Ksema\" who may possibly have been none otherthan Ksemaraja, his most distinguished disciple. It must have beenin this period of his life that Madhuraja, an aged itinerant ascetic, camefrom South India to Kashmir and wrote his eulogy of Abhinavaguptaentitled, Reflections on the Master (Gurunathaparamarsa). There hedescribes Abhinavagupta as still young and seated in the midst of agreat congregation of religious leaders, preceptors and female ascetics(yogini) who recognised him to be the foremost preceptor of all theSaiva groups then prevalent in Kashmir, including the Siddhanta,Varna, Bhairava, Kaula and Trika.37Abhinavagupta's works can be said to represent the climax of ahermeneutics of synthesis and exegesis of the Saivagama initiated by"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthe revelation of the Aphorisms of Siva (Sivasutra) to Vasugupta inthe beginning of the ninth century (see below). In his Light of the Tantraswhich, according to Abhinava, is a manual of the rituals and attendantdoctrines of the Anuttaratrikakulan (also known simply as Trika),he introduced a unified exegetical scheme inspired by Sambhunatha,his teacher in Trika Saivism. This scheme brings together what he sawas the essential elements of all Saiva ritual and doctrine. Thus he soughtto fill out and complete the theology and praxis of the Trika school.39As we know that Sambhunatha came to Kashmir from JalandharapHha(Punjab? Himachal?), and that his teacher, Sumati, came from \"somesacred place in the southern land,\"40 it seems therefore that Trika, inthe form Abhinavagupta learned it, was not originally Kashmiri.Trika, so called because triads feature prominently in its presentationof the nature of reality and praxis, is said (in the Kashmiri tradition)to look to three scriptures as its primary authorities, namely, theMdlinivijayottaratantra, the Siddhayogesvarimata and the (A)ndmaka-tantra. The Mdlinlvijaya is quoted by authors prior to Abhinavaguptaas was another Trikatantra, the Trikasdra.41 The Triad of Supreme{Para), Middling (Pardpard) and Inferior (Apard) goddesses, who arethe focus of worship in this school, were also known and venerated42in Kashmir before Abhinavagupta's time. Even so, it was he who madeTrika the focal point of non-dualist Kashmiri Saivism.In order to trace the history of Trika Saivism we must eventuallycome to grips directly with Agamic Saivism in its original scripturalsources. It is also there that we must seek to uncover the origins oftwo other Tantric systems scholars have discerned as syncretized in theworks of these Kashmiri Saivites, namely, the Kula and Krama.43 Wemust seek out the origins of these systems in the Agamas because it isin them, and through them, that these systems developed until theyemerged, as it were, from out of the dark, mysterious anonymity ofscripture and revealed their essential purport in the works of knownauthors who were the recipients of a traditional interpretation of thesescriptures.This aspect of Kashmir Saivism is the hardest to deal with becausethe origins of these systems, with their attendant lineages, are easilylost in their antecedents and in the broader context of the greater culticmilieu of Agamic Saivism as a whole. In order to understand Abhinava'sTrika (and hence to know an important aspect of Kashmiri Saivism) wecannot just limit ourselves to the Kula and Krama. Nor is it possibleto understand the limit of even these two systems. For although theKrama and Trika can be treated as Tantric systems in the Kashmiri Saivacontext (and we understand Kashmiri Saivism here in the restricted"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction  13sense noted above), if we inquire into their antecedents we find thatthey do not have the same clearly defined identity in their scripturalsources. Thus Kula is not a Tantric school or system in the same senseas are the Trika and Krama insofar as 'Kula' is a broader generic termfor a number of major traditions, each with its own secondary branches.Again, in both the Agamic context and Abhinava's Light of the Tantras,\"Kula\" is not only a blanket term for Kaula Saivism (as a distinct categoryof the Saivagama)44 but also indicates a liturgical type or archetypalpattern which Abhinava terms Kulaprakriya, the 'Kula Method'.This method is contrasted with, as complementary to, the basic TantricMethod—Tantraprakriya. The rituals of the Krama school, whichinvolve the. consumption and offering of meat and wine to the deity,as well as ritual intercourse,45 fall into the former pattern. Those of theTrika (as we would expect since it integrates every form into itself)contain both. That Trika and Krama (at least as presented in theKashmiri Saiva context) share common Kaula roots is clear from thefact that the masters who are traditionally said to have brought theKula scriptures to earth are equally venerated in both traditions.46This does not mean that the Trika school is to be simply identified withKula for Abhinava clearly distinguishes between the two in a numberof places, usually indicating the superiority of the former over thelatter We understand this to mean not that Trika excludes KaulaSaivism but that Trika, as presented by Abhinava, completes it, so tosay, as its finest flower. Indeed, from Abhinava's point of view, whichhe supports by reference to scripture and sustains on the authority of histeacher Sambhunatha, Trika comes as the culmination of the entireSaivagamic tradition and encompasses it.47 Heading a hierarchy ofAgamic 'systems', arranged in such a way that the higher membersinclude the lower, Trika (and hence Kashmiri Saivism) contains themall. Abhinava thinks of Tantric systems in their original Agamic contexts.He makes observations on the level and relationship between initiatesbelonging to the different currents (srotas) of Saiva scripture.48 Thisis coupled, following a method of exegesis already worked out in theAgamas themselves, with the hierarchy of forces and metaphysicalprinciples which constitute reality.49 It makes sense, therefore, thatAbhinava should insist that in order to study and understand KashmiriSaivism, it is essential not only to have studied grammar* logic and theorthodox philosophical systems, but also to have a sound knowledgeof the Saivagamas.50Sumati, who was Abhinava's grandteacher in the Trika, wasreputed to have a thorough understanding of the five currents ofSaiva scripture as well as the Pasupata and kindred schools that"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconstitute the Higher Path (atimarga).5. Trika, Krama and Kula aretherefore just a part of what Abhinava and Kashmiri authors haveattempted to bring together into one system. Although they are certainlyvery important, they are far from being the only components. In fact,we should even reckon the dualist Saivasiddhanta amongst them, notto mention the Agamas of the Bhairava current of Saiva scripture.The former is important because it constitutes the backbone of theritual of Abhinava's Trika, which he presents as blended predominantlywith that of the Malinivijaya, the Svacchandabhairavatantra and otherTantras such as the Trisirobhairava and Devyayamala. The latteris important because at least the Siddhayogesvarlmata, one of themost authoritative of the triad of scriptures to which Abhinava's Trikalooks for scriptural support, belongs to the Bhairava group of Saivagamas.Tantra, Kashmiri Saivism and Kashmiri Societyin the Eleventh CenturyDespite Kalhana's frequent references to temple building andendowments and the pains he takes to note prominent figures inKashmir's history, and although he himself was Saivite,52 he ignoresSaiva teachers of the non-dualist faction. The one exception is a well-known reference to Kallatabhafta,53 a key figure in the Spanda traditionto whom we shall have occasion to refer later. Clearly what we nowadayscall Kashmiri Saivism was not a religion of the masses. Abhinavaguptahimself declares that it is very hard to find even one person who isqualified to follow the Saivism of his Light of the Tantras. Nonetheless,he wishes that \"at least someone impelled by Siva should make aneffort to achieve perfection in this system\".54 Here Abhinava is referringspecifically to the form of Trika Saivism he elaborates in this work.He implies that those who dedicated themselves to this system were aminority amongst the followers of that type of Agamic Saivism to whichthe Trika was affiliated, namely, that of the Kaulas and of the Bhairava-gamas. Although the members of these Agamic traditions were them-selves probably a minority of the Hindu population, they must havebeen a notable feature of Kashmiri society, certainly larger in numberthan their absence in Kalhana's work would lead one to suppose. Thisis probably due to the fact that Kalhana, being the son of a minister,was particularly concerned with the history of the Kashmiri courtsand their vicissitudes, rather than with the religious history of Kashmir,Although Abhinavagupta, for example, must have been an intellectual"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction  15of repute, Kalhana never refers to him. This is probably because Abhinavalived a life away from the Kashmiri political scene, never attachinghimself to the court despite his reputation among his contemporaries.Another reason for Kalhana's silence was that the type of Saivaculture represented in the elevated and refined works of these authorswas a source of scandal and the object of active repression. Kalhanahimself entertained but scant regard for the individuals who posed asits privileged hierophants. What he has to say about King Kalasa andhis associates exemplifies his attitude well. King Kalasa (1063-89 A.D.)lived a particularly dissolute life choosing to surround himself withrogues, procurers, and teachers of Tantric cults that encouraged depravityand licentiousness. One such was the 'Cat Merchant' whose influenceover the king and the learned of his court suggests that belief in these'extremist' Bhairava-centred Saiva cults prevailed at times even inthese circles. Thus Kalhana writes:These honourable and learned men (bhaffapada) who knew howto behave fearlessly at great [Tantric] rites and who, grimly consciousof their power and thus immune to terror, were heedless even toBhairava, would fall to the ground in fear and bend their knees beforethe 'Cat Merchant*, who put them at ease again by placing his handon their heads ... Deceitful of his ignorance and vaunting his [learning]as a physician and Guru, he gradually established a position [for himself]as the Guru of dyers and other craftsmen.55Abhinava, for his part, wrote eulogies of the land of Kashmir as aplace where Tantric adepts, male and female, met to drink the wine forwhich his beloved land was famous and \"inspired timid lovers withconfidence\"56 to play in this garden strewn with saffron flowers growingas an offering to the Three Goddesses of Trika Saivism. Ksemendra,a well-known Kashmiri poet and younger contemporary of Abhinava,57on the contrary, was struck by the hypocrisy, greed and lasciviousnessof the masters of the Tantric cults belonging to the culture from whichAbhinavagupta drew inspiration. He felt it his moral duty to writebiting satires on this and other aspects of what he considered to be thecorruplion that afflicted Kashmiri society in his day.58 In this spirit hedescribes in his Garland of Satire {Narmamala) a Kaula ritual centredon a mantfala in which are drawn male and female sexual organs coupledin union. The rite is officiated by Trighantika, a Bhairavacarya (alsocalled Kulacarya) who, already in a drunken state, is brought to thehouse where the rite is to take place, supported by two disciples. Hisother disciples are a motley crowd of low caste reprobates including"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"16  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONshoemakers, butchers, fishermen, fake ascetics, old prostitutes, pimps,liquor distillers and drunken Brahmin bards.

Full of wisdom, he knows the nature of lust.59Supposedly learned Brahmins who belonged to the higher levelsof society were also among K$emendra's favourite targets. Kauladoctrines were, it seems, particularly deleterious for them. He writes:[Here], come to his preceptor's house, is the learned Brahmin(bhaffa) initiated [into Kaula practice]. In his hands a fish and ajar[of liquor], his mind made up to drink, freed by JCaula doctrine of thesense of shame [he should feel] by virtue of his caste.Filling himself with [the wine which is] Bhairava, making the sound\"gala gala\" of a jar as it fills, he seems carried away in its flow and isbent over by its flood [like a jar tipping over in a torrent of water thatmakes that same sound as it fills].Passing thus the night [he leaves] drunk, vomiting his wine; hisface licked by a dog, the Brahmin in the morning is purified by hisprostration in the midst of other learned men.60Cakrabhanu was an important Kashmiri master of the Kalikrama.According to Kalhana, he was the son of a minister who, for his objection-able practices, was branded on the forehead with the mark of a dog'sfoot.61 A manuscript of one of his works, possibly written in prison,is preserved in Nepal. There he writes about how he longs to be releasedfrom prison so that he can go out at night to the cremation ground, hisforehead covered with the edge of his turban, to offer human sacrificeto the goddess Kal!.62 Somadeva, a Jain monk living in South Indiain the tenth century, refers in the Yasastilaka to the Kaulas whom heidentifies with the followers of the Trika.

If salvation were the fruit of reckless living, he says,then it would sooner come to thugs and butchers than to Kaulas. Even"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction   17though this is almost the only independent reference we have to TrikaJsaivism, it is nonetheless solid evidence for the existence of Trika as adistinct school and to its presence far outside the confines of Kashmir.63Somadeva also tells us in this way that the followers of the Agamic Trikawere (or at least seemed to him to be) far different from the refined,spiritual Kashmiris, like Abhinavagupta, in whose hands Trika cameto finally blossom.The Philosophy of Recognition and the Doctrine of VibrationUp to now we have dealt with the components of Kashmiri Saivismthat are derived directly from the Tantric traditions of the Saivagamas,namely, the Kula, Krama and Trika. The two schools of KashmiriSaivism left to consider, namely, those concerned with the philosophyof Recognition (Pratyabhijna) and the Doctrine of Vibration (Spanda),unlike the others, do not extend back directly into Agamic traditions.Both have, for this reason, a peculiar importance of their own andmerit separate consideration as independent schools although theyshare much in common and have deeply influenced each other. Weturn first to the philosophy of Recognition and conclude with theDoctrine of Vibration, the subject of this book.The Pratyabhijna represents the fullest expression of Saiva monism,systematically worked out into a rational theology of Siva and philosophyof absolute consciousness with which He is identified. The Pratyabhijnatakes its name from the Stanzas on the Recognition of God (Jsvara-pratyabhijnakarika) written by Utpaladeva towards the beginning ofthe tenth century. Utpaladeva understood the ultimate experience ofenlightenment to consist essentially of a profound and irreversiblerecognition that one's own authentic identity is Siva Himself. Accordingto him:The man blinded by ignorance (Maya) and bound by his actions(karma) is fettered to the round of birth and death, but when knowledgeinspires the recognition of his divine sovereignty and power (aisvarya)he, full of consciousness alone, is a liberated soul.64According to Utpaladeva, the soul is bound because he has forgottenhis authentic identity and can only achieve liberation, the ultimategoal of life, by recognising his true universal nature. Realising thateverything is a part of himself, extending his being in wonderfullydiverse forms, the fettered soul achieves this recognition and with it the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"18  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconviction that he is not a slave of creation (pasu) but its master (pati).In this way he who thought himself weak discovers his spiritual might.Failing to recognise his identity with Siva, the one reality Who is thelife and Being of every existing thing, the soul perceives only theirindividual identity and thus severs them from one another and fromhimself. For this reason he is seemingly sullied by his actions andafflicted by the myriad conditions that stand as obstacles to the realisationof his goals.65 Yearning for liberation, he is like a young woman betrothedby arrangement to a handsome man. Hearing of his many fine qualitiesshe comes to love him even though she has never seen him. One day theychance to meet but she remains indifferent to him until she noticesthat he possesses the qualities of the man she is to marry and so, to hergreat delight, she recognises him.66 Similarly, just as man and wifebecome one in spirit, so the fettered soul becomes one with Siva byrecognising his identity with him, and is liberated.Utpaladeva's teacher was Somananda whose Vision of Siva(Sivadrs(i) is the first work of the Recognition school. Somanandalived towards the end of the ninth century and was, he says, the nineteenthin line from Tryambaka. Tryambaka, according to Somananda,67was the mind-born son of Durvasas,68 who taught him the principlesof Saiva monism he had learnt on Mount Kailasa from Srikantha,a form of Siva.69 Tryambaka figures again in another account, thistime one which refers to the origin of Trika.70 According to this story,Durvasas was instructed by Snkantha (here represented as an incarnationof Siva) that \"he may spread the wisdom of Trika (sadardhakrama)which is the essence of the secret of all Saiva scripture.\"71 Durvasas thengenerated from his mind three perfected yogis, namely, Tryambaka,Amardaka and Snnatha, who taught Saiva monism, dualism andunity-in-difference, respectively.72 Of these, the lineage (sampradaya)founded by Tryambaka that transmitted monistic Saivism was noneother than that of the Trika.73On the basis of this connection J. C. Chatterjee thought thePratyabhijna to be the \"philosophy proper of the Trika\" and identifiedthe two as did K. C. Pandey.74 At the same time Pandey simply tookthe Tryambaka of these accounts to be Somananda's legendary ancestor75and distinguished between monistic Saivism as a whole founded byTryambaka and the Pratyabhijna started by Somananda.76 PresumablyPandey believed that Trika was the original form of monistic Saivismof which the Pratyabhijna was a later development, initiated bySomananda. It seems more likely, however, that Trika was traditionallyidentified in this way with monistic Saivism as a whole to enhance itsimportance. In the same way, Somananda attributed the beginnings"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction  19of his own system to a popular mythical figure associated with the originsof Agamic Saivism in order to lend it the authority of a tradition groundedin the scriptures. To do this he sought the support of an already existingmythical account of the origin of the monistic strains in the Agamas.Utpaladeva, therefore, is justified in referring to the Pratyabhijnataught by Somananda as a 'New Path'.77 It is, moreover, an entirelyKashmiri product. Jayaratha, Abhinavagupta's commentator, accord-ingly says that this, the doctrine of the 'oneness of the Lord' (Jsvaradvaya-vada\\ initiated by Somananda, flourished in Kashmir and it is fromthere that it spread to other parts of India where it was received asa product of that land, as precious and unique to it as saffron itself.78The importance of the Pratyabhijna in the development of KashmiriSaivism lies in its rigorously philosophical exposition of those fund-amental principles of monistic Saivism that Kashmiri Saivites consideredto be essentially common to all the schools of Kashmiri Saivism. Throughthe Pratyabhijna the monism of the Tantric schools and their idealismwas supported by sound argument and an analysis of the fundamentalproblems that any thoroughgoing Indian philosophy must tackle.These problems include the nature of causality, the problem of changeand continuity, the nature of the absolute and its relationship to itsmanifestations and the relationship between God and man.Somananda and Utpaladeva enjoy the distinction of havingintroduced a number of fundamental concepts previously unknownor poorly understood. Certainly the most important of these new ideaswas the concept of the Superego. According to these philosophersultimate reality is Siva Who is the identity of all beings as pure Tconsciousness. This entirely original idea had important repercussionsin the later monistic philosophies through which the Tantras wereinterpreted. Worth noting also is the fact that the precedents of whatis less original in this philosophy are found not so much in the Agamas(although it is certainly, as it professes, in harmony with their monisticstrains), but in the works of earlier philosophers and so should beconsidered to belong to the history of Indian philosophy rather thanreligion.An important source of the Pratyabhijna is, for example, thephilosophy of the Saivasiddhanta (not to be confused with the Siddhanta-gamas). Although Saivasiddhanta is dualist in orientation and insistson a distinction between God and the individual soul, nonetheless itprefigures many of the essential elements of the philosophy of Recog-nition. Particularly important in this respect is the Siddhanta's phenomen-ological analysis of Being which stresses the reality of experience.The world is quite real79 and consciousness is the essential nature of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONboth God and the soul despite their equally essential differences.Consciousness is the direct perception of entities just as they are inthemselves, insofar as it is experience-as-such (anubhava) free ofthought-constructs.80Somananda was concerned with refuting rival Hindu schools;he does not tackle the traditional enemy of the Hindu philosopher,namely, the Buddhist. Utpaladeva, on the contrary, builds up thePratyabhijna as a critique of the Buddhist doctrine of'no-self (anatma-vada)*1 and in this way he is clearly following in the tracks of his dualistSaiva precursors. In a manner reminiscent of Utpaladeva's latterargumentation, the Siddhanta pointed to the phenomenon of recognitionas proof that objects are not momentary and that they are essentialfor language to be possible.82 Moreover, a conscious Self, the Siddhantaargued, must persist unchanged in order to connect a previous perceptionwith a subsequent perception as a necessary condition for recognition.83In Somananda's work, the term 'recognition' appears just once and doesnot bear the specific technical sense it has for Utpaladeva. Somanandadoes seek to establish that a unity must exist between the perception ofa previously perceived object and its recollection in order that itsrecognition as the same be possible, but he does this merely to provethat an essential unity underlies the two perceptions.84 He does notthink of recognition as the intuitive capacity of consciousness to graspits own nature. This extension of the recognitive faculty common toevery act of determinate perception occurs for the first time withUtpaladeva.The development of the meaning and implication of the conceptof recognition is emblematic of the logical development of this phaseof the history of Indian philosophical thought from dualist to monisticSaivism. It serves to stress the fact that the Pratyabhijna developedin the milieu of philosophical and theological speculation. The Spandaschool and its Doctrine of Vibration, with which this book is concerned,is best understood, however, as a development of the practical applicationof the yogic doctrines of the esoteric Agamic traditions of Kashmir.The Doctrine of VibrationJust as the Pratyabhijna school is named after Utpaladeva'sStanzas on the Recognition of God, so the Spanda school takes itsname from one of its root texts, namely, the Spandakarikd, the Stanzason Vibration. The philosophy of the Pratyabhijna focuses on theliberating recognition of the soul's authentic identity as Siva while the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction   21I )octrine of Vibration stresses instead the importance of experiencingSpanda, the vibration or pulse of consciousness. The mainstay of theDoctrine of Vibration is the contemplative experience the awakenedyogi has of his true nature as the universal perceiving and actingconsciousness. Every activity in the universe, as well as every perception,notion, sensation or emotion in the microcosm* ebbs and flows as partof the universal rhythm of the one reality, which is Siva, the one GodWho is the pure conscious agent and perceiver. According to theDoctrine of Vibration, man can realise his true nature to be Siva byexperiencing Spanda, the dynamic, recurrent and creative activityof the absolute.The Spanda school, like the Pratyabhijna, originated and developedin Kashmir through the works of known authors, not in anonymousTantras. Indeed, the origins of this school mark the beginnings ofKashmiri Saivism in our modern sense of the term. In the first halfof the ninth century, a Saiva ascetic called Vasugupta received, Ksemarajatells us, a revelation from Siva in a dream in which he was told that animportant message for all mankind lay hidden on Mount Mahadevain Kashmir. Going to the spot indicated to him, he found a boulder onwhich were inscribed the Aphorisms of Siva (Sivasutra).*5 Consistingof some eighty brief statements, the Sivasutra summarizes the essentialsof monistic Saiva Yoga. Although its authorship is traditionallyattributed, as is scripture, to Siva Himself, it is nonetheless the firstKashmiri Saiva work. Concise as it is profound, the Sivasutra requiredexplanation and so commentaries came to be written, four of whichsurvive. The most extensive is the Vimarsinl by Ksemaraja, Abhinava-gupta's closest disciple. It has already been translated into a number oflanguages. Varadaraja, Ksemaraja's junior contemporary, wroteanother commentary largely based on Ksemaraja's work. Althoughlacking originality it does contain a few novel ideas. It is not just asummary cf it, as is the anonymous Sivasutravrtti. A fourth commentary,by Bhaskara, however, differs from it in many respects. PredatingKsemaraja's work, it appears to represent an independent commentatorialtradition. It is, as yet, untranslated.86Vasugupta's most prominent disciple was Kallatabhatta who livedduring the reign of King Avantivarman (855-883 A.D.).87 The Stanzason Vibration (Spandakarika) are, according to some Kashmiri Saivaauthors,88 the work of Kallatabhafta who wrote them with the intentionof summarizing the teachings of the Sivasutra. Although we cannot besure whether it was he who wrote the Stanzas or, as Ksemaraja maintains,Vasugupta himself, there can be no doubt that he wrote a short com-mentary (vrtti) on it which was the first of a series of commentaries by"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONvarious authors, including two by Ksemaraja who took a specialinterest in this branch of Kashmiri Saivism. Indeed, it seems thatKsemaraja's very first work was a commentary on the first verse of theStanzas which he called the Essence of Vibration (Spandasamdoha).After writing his commentary on the Aphorisms, he wrote an extensivecommentary on all the Stanzas called the Determination of Vibration(Spandanirnaya). This work has been translated.89In a companion volume we shall publish a translation and studyof Kallata's commentary along with K§emaraja's Essence of Vibrationand the remaining two surviving commentaries that have not yet beentranslated, namely, the Lamp of Spanda (Spandapradipikd) byBhagavatotpala and the Extensive Commentary (yivrti) by RajanakaRama.90 Although both predate Ksemaraja, they are later than Utpala-deva whom they quote and so belong to the latter half of the tenthcentury. The reader is referred to our volume of translations for adetailed account of these authors and the historical development ofthe Doctrine of Vibration as reflected in their works.Notes on Methodology and Synopsis of ContentsThis book can be read from two points of view: as an introductionto the doctrines and practices of the Spanda school of Kashmiri Saivismas well as to Kashmiri Saivism as a whole. The reader is thus free to readthis volume alone or else to make use of it as an introductory study tothe companion volume of translations. The scope of the present workcovers the exposition of the Doctrine of Vibration in its most completeexpression as presented by Ksemaraja in his commentaries on theStanzas on Vibration, a work which, although considered to be theroot text of the Spanda school, Ksemaraja effectively treats as a conciseand direct exposition of the essentials of Kashmiri Saivism as a whole.It seems that for this reason he boasts of the superiority of his commentaryover that of others who failed to present such a complete synthesisof the essential doctrines of all the schools of Kashmiri Saivism.91Insofar as the fifty-one Stanzas on Vibration present the essentialteachings of the Aphorisms of Siva,92 which Ksemaraja characterizesas \"a compendium of secret Saiva doctrine,1'93 they are a succinctexposition of monistic Saiva yoga—the 'secret' of the Saivagama.94Following in Ksemaraja's tracks, this exposition presents Spandaas a doctrinal formulation of the dynamic character of the absoluteand its manifestations at every level of existence and experience.Appearing in many forms, it is a fundamental feature of the Saiva"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction   23absolute, both in the primary Agamic sources and in their exegesisat the hands of Kashmiri authors. In the present work we have thereforechosen to cut across the internal distinctions between schools andtraditions within Kashmiri Saivism to present Spanda as a conceptwhich represents an important point of contact between them, on theone hand, ond on the other to see how each of these schools contributeto the development of the Doctrine of Vibration within the contextof the Spanda tradition. In our companion work, particularly in ouranalysis of the Stanzas of Vibration and their commentaries, we notedifferences in emphasis and terminology and points of divergence betweenthis and other schools of Kashmiri Saivism. We also indicate how thecommentators who have drawn from other traditions have modifiedthe original Spanda doctrine and how it has, in its turn, influencedthese other schools. In other words, the presentation of the Doctrineof Vibration in the present work is systematic and generic, whereasin the later it is historical and particular.These two approaches are possible and valid because KashmiriSaivism can be studied as a unit and does indeed constitute, accordingto its authors, a single corpus of literature. Even so, when we studythese works we find ourselves drawn in two directions, one being toconsider them as part of a whole, and the other to discern in themdifferent schools or systems.95 Thus on the one hand we can study eachsystem in the process of its development within the context of KashmiriSaivism (and in some cases, through their Agamic antecedents); onthe other hand, we can study Kashmiri Saivism as a collective developmentof these various schools. Each system develops to varying degrees,and in different ways, by the accretion of elements from others andcan be explained in terms of the other systems. Thus the study ofany one of these systems is impossible without reference to the others.This is particularly true of the Spanda tradition because, as alreadynoted, it eventually came to represent a focal point of synthesis of allthese schools. From this point of view Spanda presents in generaland essential terms the whole of Kashmiri Saivism.Thus although this book is about Spanda, the Pratyabhijna servesas an important source, particularly for the first two chapters because,despite differences in both doctrine and terminology, it has served,within the extended ambit of the Spanda tradition presented by RajanakaRama and Ksemaraja, as a definitive statement and defence, in philo-sophical terms, of Spanda doctrine. The point of contact is the idealismof both systems. Consciousness rather than Being is the most perfectrepresentation of the absolute. It is not just a consciousness whichobserves but one that actively perceives itself as its object through,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"24  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONand as, each act of perception. The fundamental concept of consciousnessas a universally active and absolute principle is common to both Spandaand Pratyabhijna. Indeed, it is common to every formulation of thenature of ultimate reality we find expressed in the varying terminologyof the doctrinal systems which constitute the semantic manifold ofKashmiri Saivism as a whole.Spanda is the spontaneous and recurrent pulsation of the absoluteobjectively manifest as the rhythm of the arising and subsidence ofevery detail of the cosmic picture that appears within its infinite expanse.At the same time, Spanda is the inner universal vibration of consciousnessas its pure perceptivity (upalabdhfta) which constitutes equally itscognizing subjectivity (jnatftvd) and agency (kartrtva). Common toall these systems is this liberating insight into the nature of the outerrecurrence of reality through its manifest forms as an expression of itsinner freedom and inherent power. It is for this reason that it is possibleto move from the world of discourse of one system to that of anotherto form a single universe of expression.In Chapter One the Saiva concept of the absolute is contrastedwith that developed through an exegesis of the Upanisads by Sankarain his Advaita Vedanta. Although this form of non-dualist Vedantawas unknown to these authors, it represents, typologically, forms ofabsolutism they knew well, namely, those that understood non-dualitysolely as the transcendental unity of the absolute. This transcendentalabsolute is the infinite, supreme reality (paramartha) contrasted withthe finite as the ground of its apparent existence. The finite, althoughnot totally unreal, is a lesser reality of undefinable status (anirvacaniya),much as an illusion exists in relation to its real ground.This approach is contrasted with that of monistic Saivism, whichestablishes that reality can be one and undivided only if it is understoodto be a creative, infinite absolute that manifests itself actively throughthe finitude and transitoriness of phenomena perpetually changing inconsonance with the absolute's activity. Thus we encounter Spanda inits most fundamental form when we deal with the Saiva solution to theproblem of relating the finite to the absolute—a problem commonto all absolutisms. It is Spanda, the inscrutable pulse of consciousness,that moves and yet moves not, that changes and yet remains eternallyitself, that ensures that both manifestation and the absolute, its unmanifestsource, form part of a single process which passes freely from one tothe other in such a way that both poles are at the same level and equallyreal.Somananda lists a number of Vedantas in terms of their mostcharacteristic doctrines. Amongst them are the bhr&ntivadins, who"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction   25maintain that the world is an illusion and hence unreal.96 Thus, althoughhe did not know about Sarikara's Advaita, Somananda was well awarethat the world of manifestation can be understood to be less thanreal, and he is careful to refute this view in various places throughouthis work. Later Pratyabhijna authors, particularly Abhinavagupta,follow suit. The Pratyabhijna doctrine of manifestation (abhasavada)differs radically from that Tormulated by the forms of Vedanta typifiedby Sarikara's Advaita. From the Advaita point of view, manifestationis an appearing to be (dbhdsa) in the place of actual existence. Theunity of being appears to be a multiplicity in the sense of its seemingto appear as such. Those ignorant of the underlying unity behind thisapparent diversity assume that the latter is all that exists whereas ithas no real independent existence. The Pratyabhijna also understandsmanifestation to be an appearance {abhasa)—not, however, in thesense of a semblance, but as the manifest form of the absolute. Theeveryday world of diversity is not a world of semblances contrastedwith an absolute that preserves its authenticity and absolute natureby never being actually and phenomenally manifest.Although these Kashmiri schools are idealist, they affirm thereality of the world and the common commerce of daily life (yyavahara).Even so, the reality status of appearances is variously conceived in theworks of Pratyabhijna authors, and in Kashmiri Saivism as a whole.To quote extreme examples, we can observe a contrast between theuncompromising realism of Somananda—for whom even illusions arereal insofar as they are manifest appearances—and Abhinava's adaptationof the Paramdrthasdra, in which we find a clear-cut distinction betweenlevels of manifestation in the absolute, such that the higher levels arefuller expressions of its essential nature, and therefore are more 'real'than the lower levels. Similarly, we can observe a range of views inthe commentaries on the Stanzas on Vibration. Bhagavatotpala, forexample, influenced by monistic Kashmiri Vaisnavism,97 maintainsthat the universe is, in a sense, both a real as well as an apparent trans-formation of the absolute (parindma and vivarta).9* Rajanaka Rama,on the other hand, tends to interpret the Stanzas as positing a distinctionbetween a real, ultimate reality (paramdrtha) and the unreal (asat)experience of pleasure, pain and dullness.99 K§emaraja, for his part,maintains that in reality \"nothing arises or falls away\" but, even so,asserts that manifestation is real in the sense that it is the shining appearingof the power of consciousness.100 The divergence and contrast betweenthe presentation of Spanda doctrine and its original form in the Stanzasis a measure of the divergence of views within the wider ambit of theworks by Kashmiri Saiva authors and those they accepted as authoritative."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONOur point of departure here is the presentation of the world-affirmingrealism of Saiva absolutism as a whole. Despite the fact that it wasvariously tempered in the course of its exposition and development,this realism remained essentially unchanged.Chapter Two deals with the Pratyabhijna representation of theSaiva absolute as Light (prakasa) and reflective awareness (vimarsa),terms which denote the pure Light of the absolute and its infiniteappearing. The absolute is Siva Who is universal consciousness andman's authentic nature (atman) Who, reflecting on Himself, activelygenerates and discerns His own manifestations.101 Thus a strikingfeature of Pratyabhijna literature in its original sources is the regular usemade of analogies with the properties of light to express and explainthe nature of manifestation. It is common in these works for the authorto express the notion that an object is manifest, appears, is visible, orjust simply exists, by saying that \"it shines.\" Thus, typically, thePratyabhijna establishes that all things participate in the one realityby arguing that nothing 'shines' (i.e., appears, manifests or exists in itsapparent form) if it is not illuminated by the light of consciousness.If phenomena were to be anything but 'light', they could not 'shine',that is, exist. One cannot help recalling here a famous passage fromthe Svetasvataropanisad:The sun shines not there, neither moon nor stars. There theseflashes of lightning do not shine nor does fire. It is that by whose shiningall things shine. It is the light of That which illumines all this.102Light and its attendant phenomena fascinated Kashmiri minds.Thus the dualist Kashmiri Siddhantins also make use of light analogiesfreely, as do monistic Kashmiri Vaisnavas and Kashmiri poets such asRatnakara (the author of the Haravijaya) who uses words for iight'or 'brilliance' to express the appearance of the details which fill out anddecorate his poetic descriptions. Even so, it is with Utpaladeva andAbhinavagupta that this terminology really comes into its own.Somananda makes but sparse use of it, while in the Aphorisms ofSiva and the Stanzas on Vibration which predate Somananda, theterms 'light' (prakasa) and 'reflective awareness' (vimarsa) are entirelyabsent.Consequently, Spanda doctrine (and so, one could add, KashmiriSaivism at its inception) originally lacked an important characterisationof absolute consciousness which clearly distinguishes it from otherIndian absolutisms, namely, its existential status as a Superego (aham-bhava). Utpaladeva was later to insist that if the light of consciousness"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction  27were devoid of reflective awareness, it would be as inert and lifeless asthe light of a crystal.103 He meant to say that the light of consciousnessnot only illumines and makes manifest all things, but that it is a livinglight which, reflecting on itself, is an infinite, self-conscious subjectivity.This subjectivity, as the pure T sense, is the very \"life of all livingbeings.\"104 Somananda also refers to Siva as the pure egoity of'myself(asmad)105 and in so doing clearly distinguishes his view from thatof his senior predecessors who were the custodians of the doctrinesof the Aphorisms of Siva and the Stanzas on Vibration.A careful, unprejudiced reading of the Stanzas without referenceto its later commentaries (all of which postdate Utpaladeva) revealsthat despite the fact that commentators found the Superego hidden inthese verses, it was not really there. The original concept of the Selfin these early works was, in fact, generally closer to that of the Agamas,which understood liberation as a freedom from egoity that entailedno loss of personal identity. Accordingly, in the Stanzas, this self-identity is neither understood as an impersonal 'atman'nor as a Superego,but rather as one's own being (svabhdva) which, belonging to none other,is intimately one's own (svasvabhava) as one's own fundamental stateof being (svasthiti). This personal identity is the living soul (jiva) whois none other than Siva Himself.106 The soul's inherent and authenticattribute (akrtrimadharmd) is cognizing subjectivity (jnatrtva) coupledwith agency (kartrtva).101 Yet although it is thus both the agent andknower, the soul is nowhere identified with an ego^onsciousness(ahambhdva) even though it is said to be a state of pure perceivingsubjectivity (upalabdhrta). In this way the soul is not confused withthe individual subject (grdhaka) set in opposition to its object.108 Inthe Stanzas and in Kallaja's commentary, the ego is consistently relegatedto the level of a notion or conception of oneself (ahampratyaya) whichinevitably figures as a part of an idea or mental representation of thetype: \"I am happy, sad or dull.\" It is never found as a pure ego outsidesuch patterns of representation.Of the commentators, only Bhagavatotpala observes this feature ofSpanda doctrine without overlaying and obscuring it with ulteriorinterpretations. This is because he is not concerned to integratePratyabhijna into Spanda doctrine, as are the other commentatorswho stress, in typically Pratyabhijna terms, that the goal of the Spandateachings is the recognition (pratyabhijna) of Spanda as the activityof consciousness. In this way, they say, it is possible to lay hold of one'sown authentic identity as the universal agent and perceiver, understoodas the universal vibration (sdmdnyaspandd) of the pure ego. AlthoughBhagavatotpala does talk of recognition, and even quotes Utpaladeva's"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONStanzas on Recognition, his intention is to refer to nothing more thana faculty of individualised consciousness which enables One to recognisepast experience and link it with the present. He does this in order toestablish the permanence of a personal identity constantly and universallypresent in all experience. He never represents recognition as an intuitiveinsight into reality. Bhagavatotpala is in this instance (as he is in general)more consistent with original Spanda doctrine than are other commen-tators. This is not just because he seeks to be faithful to the text, butalso because the monistic Vai§navism he integrates into Spanda doctrineagrees with it more exactly, in this respect, than does the PratyaDhijna.Even so, Spanda is generally represented as the activity of the pureT and more particularly as a manner of characterising the reflectiveawareness (vimarsa) of its universal Light. This identification hasbeen so thorough that the doctrine of Self as 'one's own nature' (svabhdvaor svasvabhdva) no longer features evidently in the works of KashmiriSaivas. Although it is in fact a technical term charged with a veryspecific meaning in its own right, 'own* nature' (svabhdva) seems inthese works to be merely a manner of referring to oneself as an immediatequalification of the ultimate principle and, as such, to pure T con-sciousness.109In this way the doctrinal identity of the Spanda teachings hasbeen worn away, so much so, that as eminent a scholar as K. C. Pandeyhas been led to say that the Stanzas on Vibration is only a minor treatisedealing with certain aspects of the Pratyabhijna system, particularlywith what is termed 'reflective awareness' (vimarsa) in Utpaladeva'sStanzas on Recognition.110 Pandey has been misled by the equationsmade in the Spanda commentaries as well as in the Pratyabhijna ofcognate concepts and terms in the two systems. Thus, for example,'sphuratta\", meaning literally 'radiant pulse' or 'glittering', is an inherentquality of the light of consciousness in the Pratyabhijna world ofdiscourse. It also means 'pulsation' or 'vibration', and so quite naturallyis equated with Spanda by Abhinavagupta,111 who sees it as correspondingto the activity of the reflective awareness of consciousness which reflectsupon its manifestations within its own pure noetic continuum. ThusLight (prakdsa) represents consciousness as its own illuminatingknowledge, and awareness (vimarsa) its activity.In Chapter Two we discuss this dimension of Spanda in Pratyabhijnaterms. In Chapter Three we examine what is meant by 'Spanda' in itsown terms as a movement which proceeds from the interior domain ofundifferentiated consciousness, out to the exterior domain of itsmanifestation which is created as it moves outward and is destroyedwhen it returns to the inner state of undifferentiated unity."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction  29Just as the step from a personal self-identity, which is at the sametime the universal perceiving and acting subjectivity identified withSiva Himself, to a universal T consciousness is a short one, so toothat from Spanda (as the creative-cum-destructive activity of Reality)to its representation as power is easily made. In the original Spandadoctrine 'Spanda' is a neutral term simply denoting this recurrentactivity, whether it be that of the Supreme Principle in itself (equivalentto Siva, the male polarity) or that of its power (the female polarity)—apower that extends and withdraws as the will or intent to manifestation.The commentators are, however, generally more struck by the power ofthis activity, than by the activity itself, and so K§emaraja goes so faras to talk of the power of Spanda as 'Spandasakti\\ a term unknownto other commentators. Once again it is K§emaraja and Rajanaka Ramawho depart most distinctly from the original form of Spanda doctrine.K§emaraja, who everywhere in his works finds equivalents in Kramadoctrine for the essential principles of other systems, here sees Spanda-sakti as the Krama Goddess of Consciousness (samviddevi). RajanakaRama, who is not concerned to integrate Krama into the Doctrineof Vibration, finds equivalents in the Saktism of PradyumnabhaUa.Thus, universal Spanda, which he equates with the 'principle of power'(saktatattva),ul is none other than the Supreme Goddess (paramesvarl),who manifests Herself as all the principles (tattva) constituting the onereality—including Siva Himself. Therefore, according to RajanakaRama, Spanda is the Goddess Who is the highest principle.It is not surprising, therefore, that a number of modern scholarsconsider Spanda doctrine to be Sakta-oriented.113 Indeed, Spandaregularly figures as Sakti in Kashmiri Saiva works in general and sois presented in this way in Chapter Four where Sarikara and His Spandanature are viewed as the equivalents of Siva and Sakti. The relationshipbetween these polarities within the unity of the absolute is examined fromvarious points of view, as presented in the works of Kashmiri Saivaauthors, and in the Agamas which serve as their sources. The dynamicrecurrence which characterises their relationship is, in this exposition,the focus of attention. The pulse of their union and separation is thearchetype of the fusion and divergence of opposites, through the interplayof the elements constituting the cosmic order that takes place in harmonywith their recurrent emergence and subsidence into the absolute.Although not discussed in these terms in Spanda literature, it findsa place here as a feature of monistic Saiva (as well as Sakta) metaphysicsand its verbalization in these symbolic terms. The relationship betweenSankara and Spanda is in this way explained as that which existsbetween the absolute, as the power-holder, and its power. This relation-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONship is itself Spanda.Chapter Five discusses a subject which is clearly an element oforiginal Spanda doctrine, namely, the Wheel of Energies (sakticakrd)of which Sankara is both the source and master. This is a very importanttopic for Ksemaraja who comments extensively on the nature of theWheel of Energies. He is motivated primarily by the intention todemonstrate (as was his teacher Abhinavagupta) that the most secret,and hence highest Saiva doctrine, is that of the cycle of powersas presented in the Krama tradition, particularly that of the TwelveKalis (which Abhinava describes in his Light of the Tantras)114 andthat of VamesvarL The Wheel of Energies is in this way presented asthe cycle of universal consciousness which expresses itself at theindividual level as, and through, the powers of the senses.It follows that the next topic is the body of consciousness to whichbelongs the power of perception operating through the circle of thesenses. Thus this is the subject of Chapter Six. The yogi and hisexperience have gradually come to the fore in the course of our expositionand it is this that concerns us primarily in the remaining portion of thiswork, just as it does Spanda doctrine. Thus we discuss two forms ofcontemplative absorption, which Ksemaraja says are the subject ofthe entire Spanda teachings, namely, that 'with the eyes closed' andthat 'with the eyes open' {nimllana and unmllanasamadhi). Spandadoctrine equates the opening and closing of Siva's eyes (unmesa andnimesd) with His pulsation. It seems obvious to equate it also with theintroverted and extroverted phases of the enlightened yogi's contem-plation who, one with Siva, similarly creates and destroys the worldof his objectified perceptions by opening and closing his eyes in thesetwo phases of contemplation. Even so, only Ksemaraja actually makesthis connection. In fact, these terms themselves are peculiar to hisvocabulary. The concept is attested in the works of earlier authors,just as it is in the primary sources, but these terms, as such, are notpreviously found elsewhere, not even in Abhinavagupta's works.Thus, although Ksemaraja most likely derived these formats of represen-tation of yogic states from Krama sources, his application of thesecategories both fills them out and further contributes to Spandadoctrine. We therefore discuss them in this chapter because they areconnected with the operation of the senses and with the yogi's experienceof them in consonance with their authentic nature as the powers ofconsciousness operating in the field of its own manifestation.In Chapter Seven we discuss the nature of bondage and the meansto liberation. Although our concern is primarily with Spanda practice,we present it here in terms of the system of classification of the means"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction  31to liberation (updya) described by Abhinavagupta. Abhinavaguptaquotes the Mdlinivijayottaratantra as his authority when definingthe fundamental characteristics of these categories;115 even so, thereis no evidence to suggest that this system of classification is appliedextensively, if at all, in the Agamas or elsewhere. On the other hand,it appears that he learnt it from Sambhunatha who taught him Trikadoctrine. Thus instructed by the oral tradition, he went on to addit to the patrimony of literate Kashmiri Saivism. It is for this reasonthat we find no trace of it in any of the works that predate him. Evenso, Ksemaraja considered that the three sections into which the Aphorismsof Siva are divided dealt separately with these three orders of practiceand that the Spanda doctrine of the Stanzas could similarly be analysedin terms of these categories. We conclude this work, therefore, withan exposition of these categories in relation to Spanda practice andrefer the reader to our translation and analysis of the Stanzas on Vibrationfor its specific features and further details."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Integral Monism ofKashmiri SaivismIn India, metaphysics serves as a theoretical framework supportinga body of spiritual discipline; it is never merely abstract speculation.More than a reasoned opinion, it indicates the seeker's attitude tohis own experience, an attitude that forms the path he treads to salvation.When the seeker acts upon the conclusions he has reached, philosophyblends imperceptibly into religion. To the degree in which he participatesin this new attitude, death yields to immortality and the darkness ofdoubt and ignorance is banished by the light of spiritual illumination.Underpinning the quest is the ultimate goal: gnosis, which is not aknowledge of things but insight into their essential nature. Metaphysicalinsight is the pinnacle of knowledge. Long ago those who attained thisabsolute knowledge exclaimed: \"no longer can anyone bring beforeus anything that we have not already found understood or known.\"1It is essentially a state or experience of recognition.The ways to this realisation are various. We can tread the Path ofWisdom (jnanamarga) and seek to intuit the Real, illumined by itsown brilliance, in the directness of (an essentially mystical) insightdeveloped through meditative practice and disciplined reasoning(viveka). Another way is that of Devotion {bhaktimarga) to theembodiment of truth experienced with religious awe and wonder asDeity. A third way is to follow the Path of Yoga and seek freedomdirectly through mastery {aisvarya) of the Self and with it the Allwhich it contains and governs. From the yogi's point of view this is"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"34  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthe most direct approach, for all paths tend towards this achievement.As Karl Potter remarks:The ultimate value recognised by classical Hinduism in its mostsophisticated sources is not morality but freedom, not rational self-control in the interests of the community's welfare but complete controlover one's environment—something which includes self-control butalso involves control of others and even control of the physical sourcesof power in the universe.2Freedom (svatantrya) in the sense of both autonomy (kaivalya)and mastery (aisvarya) is the goal. It can be attained only if we manageto rid ourselves of outer constraints and limitations. To do this wemust be able to homologise with a single, all-embracing reality fromwhich nothing is excluded—neither the world nor ourselves. Th,edualism of most devotional approaches, however tempered, understandsreality in terms which preclude the possibility of ultimate release. Ifwe are to attain salvation, reality can only be one and absolute. In theHindu tradition the nature of this absolute has been understood in awide variety of ways. Here we shall consider only two. One is embodiedin the metaphysics of Kashmiri Saivism and the other in that of AdvaitaVedanta.Advaita Vedanta emerged, to a large extent, as a critique ofSamkhya dualism. Classical Samkhya posits two realities, both eternalbut of contrary nature. One is Puru?a, 'the Person1, the other Prakrtior 'Nature'. The Person is the Self who, as pure sentient consciousness,is the witness of the activity of all that lies in the sphere of objectivity.The latter includes not only the outer physical world but also the bodyand mind the Person inhabits, vitalising and illumining it with hisconscious presence. Although varied and constantly changing, allthat lies in the sphere of objectivity shares a common nature. Allthoughts, perceptions or physical phenomena are equally part of theplay of Nature—Prakrti—which manifests in this way to fulfil the needof the Person for phenomenal experience. In this experience the Personrepresents the principle of sentience and Nature that of change andactivity. Just as insentient Nature cannot view itself, and so is as if blind,similarly the Person does not act or change, and so is as if lame.3 Thetwo together make experience possible. The content of this experienceis real but unsatisfactory. The Person is bound by Nature; it experiencesthe changes in Nature as if they were its own and so suffers their painfulconsequences. The Person is freed when he discriminates betweenhimself and Nature. The latter then retires into its original unmanifest"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  35state severing its association with the Person.Isvarakrsna explains:Just as a dancing girl retires from her dance after performing forthe audience, in the same way Nature (Prakrti) retires after exhibitingherself to the Person.4In this way the Person achieves a state of transcendental detachment(kaivalya). But because the Person is an independent reality, alreadyseparate from Nature, he can in fact neither be bound nor released.Therefore, no one is actually bound, no one released and no onetransmigrates. [It is] Nature, the abode of diversity that transmigrates,is bound and released.5Ultimately, bondage is unreal and no relationship is possiblebetween an eternal subject and an equally eternal object. The problemis that they cannot be related to one another unless this relationshipis also eternal. In order to preserve the transcendental integrity of thePerson, the reality of Nature must be denied. Not only does the AdvaitaVedanta do this, but it also denies that there is a plurality of Persons.The Self, each individual's most authentic identity, is beyond thespecifications of the qualities of Nature, and so nothing can distinguishone 'self from another. The Self is one only and hence none other thanthe Brahman, the absolute, free of all specification. From this point ofview the one reality can only be grasped through negation.6 However,although this safeguards it from predication it also implies that theempirical (vyavahara) is itself a negation of absolute reality. As Ksemarajaputs it: \"the Brahman is what the world is not.\"7 And so the worldis less than real. The Brahman is always empirically unmanifest(avyakta).* It is beyond the reach of the senses but, like the Person,is the witness (sdksin) of all things. It can never be an object of knowledgefor \"who can know the knower?\"9 Ultimately it is that which cannotbe grasped or perceived. The world which is 'grasped1 and 'perceived'cannot be the Brahman and is consequently less than real.Absolute Being is not an existing quality to be found in things;it is not an object of thought or the result of production. It is that fromwhich both speech and mind turn back, unable to comprehend itsfullness.10 To make this point Sankara quotes a passage from a lostUpanisad in his commentary on the Brahmasutra. Baskali, an Upanisadicsage, is being questioned by his disciple about the nature of the absolute.He sits motionless and silent. \"Teach me, sir,\" prayed the disciple."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe teacher continued to be silent. When addressed a second and thirdtime he said: \"I am teaching, but you do not follow. The Self is silence.\"1 JThe undetermined and unthinkable character of the Brahmanis a consequence of the absolutes's eternal and immutable nature.12To concede the existence of a real universe is, from the Vedantin's pointof view,13 to posit the existence of a reality apart from the Brahman.Nor can we simply identify a real universe with the absolute unlesswe are prepared to compromise its unchanging, absolute status. Thecriterion of authenticity is immutability. Reality never changes; onlythat which is less than real can appear to do so. Reality is constantin the midst of change. What this means essentially is that there ischange although nothing changes. This impossible situation is reflectedin the ultimate impossibility of change itself. That which does notexist prior to its changing and at the end, after it has changed, must beequally non-existent between these two moments. Although the worldof change appears to be real, it cannot be so.14 Change, according tothe Vedantin, presupposes a loss of identity. Reality cannot suffertransformation; if it were to do so, it would become something elseand the real would be deprived of its reality. The immortal can neverbecome mortal, nor can the mortal become immortal. The ultimatenature of anything cannot change.15 Change of any sort is merelyapparent (vivarta); the world of change and becoming is a false super-imposition (adhydropa, adhyasa) on the absolute.16In cosmic terms, the mistake (bhranti) consists of the suppositionthat the real Brahman is the unreal universe and the unreal universeis the real Brahman. In microcosmic terms, it is the mistake of falselyconceiving the body, mind or even one's personality to be the Self.In the same way as the image of a snake is falsely superimposed on arope, similarly the universe is falsely projected onto the real substratum,the Brahman. Ignorance is not merely a personal lack of knowledge,but a cosmic principle. As such it is called \"Maya,\" the undefinablefactor (anirvacaniya) that brings this mistake in identity about. Thereality status of this cosmic illusion is also undefinable: on the one handit is not Brahman, the sole reality; on the other hand it is not absolutelynon-existent like a hare's horn or the son of a barren woman.Brahman is the source of world appearances only in the sense ofbeing their unconditioned ground or essential nature. The universeis false not because it has no nature of its own but because it does have one.Just as the illusion of a snake disappears when one sees that it is nothingbut a rope, similarly cancellation (badha) of the empirically real occurswhen the absolute reality of the Brahman is realised. Thus, accordingto Vedanta, appearance implies the real, while the real need not imply"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  37appearance. To appear is essentially to appear in place of the real,but to be real is not necessarily to appear. All things-exist because theabsolute exists. It is their Being. Thus the very existence of phenomenaimplies their non-existence as independent realities. When they areknown to be as they are, in the fullest sense of their existence, theirphenomenal nature disappears leaving the ground of Being naked andaccessible. This approach was validated by a critique of experience.The Vedanta established that space, time and the other primary categoriesof our daily experience can have no absolute existence. It was thereforenecessary to make a distinction between a relative truth—that acceptedby the precritical common man—and an absolute truth discoveredat a higher level of consciousness.The Saiva absolutist17 rejects any theory that maintains that theuniverse is less than real. From his point of view a doctrine of twotruths, one absolute and the other relative, endangers the very foundationof monism. The Kashmiri Saiva approach is integral:18 everything isgiven a place in the economy of the whole. It is equally wrong to saythat reality is either one or diverse. Those who do so fail to grasp thetrue nature of things which is neither as well as both.19\"We, do not\" says Abhinavagupta, \"base our contention that[reality] is one because of the contradictions inherent in saying that itis dual. It is your approach {paksa) that accepts this [method]. [While],if [duality and oneness] were in fact [to contradict each other], theywould clearly be two [distinct realities].\"20The Vedantin, who maintains that non-duality is the true natureof the absolute by rejecting duality as only provisionally real, is ultimatelylanded in a dualism between the real and illusory by the foolishnessof his own excessive sophistry (vdcafadurvidya). Oneness is betterunderstood as the coextensive unity (ekarasa) of both duality and unity.21They are equally expressions of the absolute.22 As Gopinath Kaviraj says:According to Sarikara, Brahman is truth and Maya is inexplicable(anirvacaniya). Hence the [Advaitin's] endeavour to demonstrate thesuperiority of Advaita philosophy is turned against his own system.It tarnishes the picture of its philosophical perfection and profundity.He cannot accept Maya to be a reality, therefore his non-dualism isexclusive. The whole system is based on renunciation and eliminationand thus is not all-embracing .... By accepting Maya to be Brahman(brahmamayi), eternal (nitya) and real (satyarupa). Brahman and Maya[in the Tantra] become one and coextensive.23"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"38  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe Vedantin seeks to preserve the integrity of the absolute bysafeguarding it from all possible predication. The Saiva24 defends theabsolute status of the absolute by ensuring that it is in every way self-subsistent (svatantra) and all-embracing (puma). The integral natureof the absolute allows for the existence of the world of objectivelyperceivable phenomena along with the pure subjectivity of consciousness.The two represent opposite polarities of a single reality. Of these two,objectivity is insignificant (tuccha) with respect to the ultimacy(paramarthatva) of the subject.25 It is the sphere of negation, in whichobjectivity presents itself as a void (sunya) in relation to the fullnessof the subject.26 Thus it appears in some Kashmiri Saiva works thatobjectivity is said to be false with respect to the ultimate reality ofabsolute consciousness.27 What is meant, however, is that nothingcan exist apart from the absolute; not merely in the sense that only theabsolute exists, but also that nothing exists separated from it. Allthings are as if nothing in themselves apart from the absolute in thissense alone—it does not mean that they do not exist.28 The world, inother words, represents a level of manifestation within the absolutewhich in the process of its emanation must, at a certain stage, radicallycontrast one aspect of its nature with another to appear as the dualityand multiplicity of manifestation.29 The One is not any one thing becauseit is all things;30 excluding nothing from its omniformity, it cannot bedefined in any other way than as the Supremely Real (paramartha).The Real is, from this point of view, the All (nikhila). It is the pureabsolute because nothing stands outside it which can in any way qualifyits absoluteness; on this point at least, Saiva and Vedantin are inagreement. It is the Saiva's approach to establishing the absolutenessof the absolute which differs from the Vedanta. The Saiva method isone of an ever widening inclusion of phenomena mistakenly thoughtto be outside the absolute. The Vedantin, on the other hand, seeks tounderstand the nature of the absolute by excluding (nisedhd) everyelement of experience which does not conform to the criterion ofabsoluteness, until all that remains is the unqualified Brahman. TheSaiva's approach is one of affirmation and the Vedantin's one of negation.They arrive at the absolute from opposite directions. The Vedantin'sway is a path of renunciation founded on dispassion (vairagya) bornof discrimination (yiveka) between the absolutely real and the provision-ally relative. It is only when all attachment, and, ultimately, perceptionand thought of the illusory world of phenomena—Maya—have beenabandoned, that the true nature of the absolute is realised to be as itreally is, that is, free of all phenomenality.

The doctrine is one of worlddenial. Thus Gautfapada, Sarikara's teacher, says:Constantly reflecting that everything is full of misery, (sarvam duhkham)one should withdraw the mind from the pleasures nurtured by desire.Recalling constantly that the birthless Brahman is all things, one nolonger perceives creation.32The Advaitic path leads to a freedom 'from'. Desire is denied becauseit individualises attention, dispersing it among the objects of desirewhich are defined as impure matter and ultimately unreal as opposedto the absolute, which is spirit and reality itself. Freedom is ignoranceof 'matter-unreality'; conversely, ignorance of the spirit is equivalentto knowledge of matter. These correspond to:A) A knowledge of qualities and conditions through acts ofdetermining knowledge {vikalpd).B) A direct experience (sak$atkara) of the unqualified (nirguna)free of determinate perception (nirvikalpa).Case A implies a contrast between subject and object, which isunreal or illusory; case B implies the disappearance of the subject-objectdistinction by denying the reality of the object, and thus expresses thereal state of affairs. A and B are not really opposites because A is unreal;consequently the contrast between A and B comes under category Aand so is illusory. In other words, our spiritual ignorance (avidya)consists of the false conception that there is a real relationship betweenthe finite and the infinite. Herein we find the philosophical justificationfor an attitude of detachment. The relationless absolute is realisedby the elimination of the finite.The New Way (navamarga)33 taught in Kashmiri Saiva doctrineis transcendence through active participation.

From this point of view ignoranceis failure to experience directly the intimate connection (sambandha)between the infinite and the finite, thus justifying an active participationin the infinite-finite continuum. Following this New Way the transitionfrom the finite to the infinite does not require that we postulate anyontological distinction between them. The finite is a symbol of theinfinite. The infinite stamps its seal (mudra) onto its own nature repletewith all possible forms of the finite.34 This is the transcendental attitudeof the absolute, namely its impending manifestation as the finite. Realityis the state of eternal emergence {satatodita) of the finite from theinfinite and vice versa. Expansion of the relative distinction (bheda)between the elements constituting the All is equivalent to contractionof the undivided (abheda) awareness of its totality and vice versa.Neither excludes the other, but together they participate in the all-embracing fullness (purnata) of the pulsation (spanda) of the absolutein its different phases of being. True knowledge (sadvidya) from thispoint of view, is to know that the apparent opposites normally contrastedwith one another, such as subject and object, unity and diversity, absoluteand relative, are aspects of the one reality.The Vedantin's way is one of withdrawal from the finite in orderto achieve a return (nivrtti) to the infinite. This process, however, fromthe Saiva point of view is only the first stage. The next stage is theoutward journey (pravrtti) from the infinite to the finite. When perfectionis achieved in both movements, that is, from the finite to the infinite andback, man participates in the universal vibration of the absolute andshares in its essential freedom. Thenceforth, he no longer travels \"to'and 'from' but eternally 'through' the absolute, realised to be at onceboth infinite and finite.35 The highest level of dispassion (paravairagya)is not attained by turning a\\>ay from appearance but by realising thatthe absolute manifests as all things.36 The absolute freely makes diversity{bheda) manifest through its infinite power. The wise know that thispower pours into the completeness of the All (visvamandala) and inso doing, flows only into itself.37 Standing at the summit of Being(parakastha) the absolute is brimming over with phenomena. Thestreams of cosmic manifestation flow everywhere from it as does waterfrom a tank full to overflowing.38 Replenished inwardly by its ownpower, it emerges spontaneously as the universe, and makes manifesteach part of the cosmic totality as one with its own nature.39The involution of phenomena and their reassimilation into theabsolute is not enough. True knowledge and perfect dispassion canonly be achieved when we realise that the universe is the expansion(vikasa) of the absolute void of content (sunyarupa).40 The absolute will"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  41(icchd) is the driving force behind this cosmic expansion. It is the pureintent of Being to act and exist which although, in a sense, is similarto mundane desire is unsullied by any object of its intent {isyamdna)41 andso differs fundamentally from it. The absolute yearns for nothing otherthan itself. Desire is not to be abandoned but elevated to the level ofthis pure will (icchdmdtra). This is achieved not by restraint or suppressionof desire, but by merging it with the divine creative will of the absolute.This is the spontaneity of the Way of Wholeness. Quotes Jayaratha:Those who went before said that [desire] is checked by the practiceof dispassion; we teach that this is achieved by desisting from all effort.42The absolute oscillates between a 'passion' (rdgd) to create and'dispassion' (virago) from the created. This is the eternal pulsation—Spanda—of the absolute. Through it the absolute transforms itselfinto all things and then returns back into the emptiness (sunya) of itsundifferentiated nature. Both poles of this movement are equally real;both are equally absolute. Allowing for the reality of manifestation,the Saiva absolute is called the Great Oneness (mahddvaya).43 Anexperienced music lover, hearing a fast sequence of notes played onthe vind can distinguish whether the microtones are high or low.44Similarly the well-practiced yogi can discern the unity of reality whilephenomena are manifest to him. If duality and unity were in factabsolute contraries, the moment they appeared together, they wouldcancel each other out. This, however, is not the case. We continue toexperience the diversity of daily life (yyavahdra)45 The Vedantin whodistinguishes between duality and unity, saying that the former is falsewhile the latter is true, is under the spell of Maya—the ignorance heseeks so hard to overcome. All forms of relative distinction, even thatbetween the dual and the non-dual, are due to Maya; none of them areapplicable to the uncreated, self-existent reality, free of all limitation.46Abhinava writes:Where duality, unity and both unity and duality are equally manifestis said to be [true] unity. To those who object that in that case diversity(bheda) must also exist, [we say:] so be it: we do not want to speakovermuch. We neither shun nor accept [anything] that [manifests to us]here [in this world] as you do. If you wish to be supported by the viewthat .. ^urs all then resort to the doctrine of Supreme Unity, thegreat refuge you should adopt.47The one reality is manifest both as unity and diversity. There can"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONbe no real unity unless diverse elements are united in the wholenessof totality. On the other hand, without unity, diversity would beunintelligible. A total dispersion of elements does not constitutediversity but a number of single, unrelated units.48 Just as everythingthat falls into a salt mine becomes salty, so all this diversity, groundedin unity, shares in the single flavour of oneness.49 There is an undeniabledifference between individual phenomena, but the distinction weperceive between two entities which leads us to think that one differsfrom the other is merely external.50 Relative distinction is not an inherentquality of things that can divide their innate nature, not because thisdivision (bheda) is in any way unreal, but because it operates withinthe domain of the real, which appears as phenomenally manifest.Division (bheda) is merely the relative distinction between two manifestentities; it is based on the difference between their manifest form.\"Relative distinction between two realities (tattva)\" writesAbhinava, \"is not impossible. This is the doctrine of Supreme Unityin which relative distinction is neither shunned nor accepted. Whilethere is [an external] difference between phenomena, there is none[inwardly], established as they are in their own essential nature.\"51Reality is the One (eka) which becomes manifest as the many (bahu).Universal Being moves between two poles, viz., diversification of theone and unification of the many. Thought (vikalpa) interferes withour direct intuitive understanding of this fact and splits up the twoaspects of this movement into separate categories. Reality is a structuredwhole consisting of a graded hierarchy (taratamya) of metaphysicalprinciples corresponding to the planes of existence (dasa). On the lowestplanes up to the level of Maya, we experience division (bheda) betweenobjects and ourselves; at the highest level we reach the plane of unity(abheda) which pervades and contains within itself all the others.Mahesvarananda writes:We maintain that the basis of duality (bheda) in the [empirical]universe is a phase (vibhaga) [of reality]! The separation between thingsis certainly not adventitious (upadhi) for then they [i.e., the object andits separatedness] being two, unity would stand contradicted.52He goes on to say:The various categories of existence (padartha), though distinctfrom one another in their [outer form] must be, in terms of their essentialspecific nature, a single collective reality.53"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  43This understanding of reality allows for a range of insights intoits nature which complement and sustain each other without conflict.Almost every school of Indian thought aspires to lead us to a plane ofbeing and an experience which it believes to be the most complete andsatisfying. This is the liberation it offers. All these views are correctinsofar as they correspond to an actual experience. But this is becausethe absolute, through its inherent power, assumes the form of all thelevels of realisation {bhumika) which correspond to the ultimate view(sthiti) each system upholds.54 Dualism is not an incorrect view ofreality although it corresponds to only one of the levels within the absolute.Citing the well-known Jaina example, Abhinava explains that theexponents of different systems are like blind men who, presented withan elephant, touch one part or another and argue amongst themselvesabout what it could be. This is not because they disagree completelybut because their agreement is only partial.55 Ultimately, differingviews of reality are the result of the capacity (sakti) of the absolute toappear in different forms.56 Rather than reject all views as incorrectbecause they are not completely true, the Kashmiri Saiva prefers toaccept them all because they are partially true. System builders are allequally concerned with reality, but are like children of feeble intellect(sukumaramati) who have not yet reached the supreme summit(parakas\\ha) of the absolute, the experience of Supreme Oneness.They cannot, as yet, look down to the lower planes and see their rolewithin the whole. Accordingly Mahesvarananda says:Not accepting each others' point of view they talk of Your universalnature in terms of that which is to be refuted and that which refutes itin order to reject [their] opponents' position.57Why does this phasing or hierarchy of planes not divide the absolute?The answer to this question will emerge through a closer examinationof the nature of the Saiva absolute. Saivism equates the absolute whollywith consciousness. Reality is pure consciousness alone (samvid).Consciousness and Being are synonymous.58 To experience the essentialidentity between them is to enjoy the bliss (ananda) of realisation.59The Advaita Vedantin maintains that in a primary sense reality cannotbe characterised in any particular way, but affirms that secondarilywe can conceive it to be 'Being-Consciousness-Bliss (saccidananda).Being, understood as an absolute substance (which is not substantialin a material sense), is the model for the Advaita conception of conscious-ness. Monistic Saivism, on the other hand, considers consciousness tobe the basic model through which we understand Being. Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONfrom the Vedantirfs point of view is the microcosmic parallel of macro-cosmic Being. Being is the real substratum of the universe and conscious-ness that of the individual personality (jlva). Hence consciousness,like Being, is perfectly inactive, a pure noetic plenum: knowledge assuch, without an object of knowledge or even self-awareness. Hemaintains that consciousness is autonomous; it is an eternal realitythat does not depend on the mind or body for its existence. On this point,the Saivite and Vedantin agree. Abhinava pours scorn on materialistviews; making no pretence at politeness, he says,Some fools consider that nothing apart from the body existsbecause movement arises from the body, whose property is conscious-ness, which in its turn is one with the vital breath. This conception,peculiar to individuals (of low status) such as children, women andidiots is, by the materialists, elevated to the status of a system.60The concept of consciousness is the firm foundation upon whichKashmiri Saiva metaphysics is constructed. One could almost describeit as a psychology of absolute consciousness. Consciousness is more thanthe awareness an individual has of himself and his environment; it isan eternal all-pervasive principle. It is the highest reality (paramartha)and all things are a manifestation of this consciousness (cidvyakti).61All entities, without distinction, are of the nature of consciousness02and hence reality can be positively affirmed to be a 'compact mass ofconsciousness and b\\\\ss\\ (ciclanandaghana). There are no holes or gapsanywhere in reality where consciousness is absent. It is eternally andblissfully at rest within its own nature (svatmavisranta), free of allassociation with anything outside itself.63 Free of all craving foranything (nirakanksd) and independent (nirapeksa), it looks to noneother but itself (ananyamukhapreksin).The essential nature (svabhava) of this pure universal consciousnessis the true nature of the Self. As the supreme subject who illumines andknows all things, it is called the 'Great Light1 {mahaprakasa) which isuncreated and can never be taught (asrauta). Figuratively described asthe sun of consciousness, its light absorbs duality in its brilliance,bathing the whole universe with the splendour of its divine radiance.Making all things one with its nature, it transforms them into the sacredcircle (mandala) of its own rays.64 Not only is consciousness absolute,it is also divine. It is Siva, the Lord (cinnatha) of the universe.65 As theauthentic identity (atman) of all living beings, consciousness is thesupreme object of worship, the true nature of Deity.66 Consciousnessis God and God is consciousness by virtue of its very nature; omnipotence,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  45omniscience and all the other divine attributes are in fact attributesof consciousness. Bhagavatotpala, commenting on the Stanzas onVibration, quotes:In none of Your states [O Lord] is consciousness absent. Therefore.You are worshipped as the yogi's dense mass of consciousness alone.67Consciousness is not a passive witness (saksiri), but is full of theconscious activity (citikriya) through which it generates the universe68and reabsorbs it into itself at the end of each cycle of creation. Thefreedom (svdtantrya) of consciousness to do this is its sovereign power(aisvarya) by virtue of which it is the one God Who governs the entireuniverse. Absolute freedom to know and do all things is the primarycharacteristic of Deity:The governing power of the Supreme Lord Whose nature isHis own unique eternal nature as pure agency (kartrta) whose essenceis the divine pulsing radiance {sphuratta) of the light of consciousness.69Both dynamic and creative, this divine power is Spanda—thevibration of consciousness. Its universal activity is the basis of Siva'sdivine sovereign status. Indeed, Spanda is Siva's most essential naturefor without it He would not be God. As K§emaraja says:Thus God (bhagavai) is always the Spanda principle with itsdependent categories - He is not motionless (aspanda) as those whosay, 'the supreme reality is perfectly inactive (aspanda)'. If that were so,His nature would be a self-confined stasis (santasvarupa) and so Hewould not be God at all.70The supreme reality which is 'perfectly inactive'is like the Vedantin'sBrahman. Although the Vedantin says that kGod alone is the source ofall things',71 Brahman cannot be a creator God (isvara) for His supposedcreation is unreal. A creator implies that His creation is a separate realityand this would contravene the fundamental principles on which AdvaitaVedanta bases its concept of non-duality. Accordingly, Saiikara says:God's rulership, omniscience and omnipotence are contingent tolimiting adjuncts conjured up by nescience: in reality such terms as rulerand ruled, omniscience etc., cannot be used with regard to the Selfshining in its own nature.72"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"46  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONKashmiri Saivism, on the contrary, believes in a personal absoluteGod Who is the one reality (isvaradvayavada). The planes within theabsolute correspond to a hierarchy of deities which rule over them,empowered to do so by the Supreme Deity: consciousness. AbsoluteDeity is the highest level of consciousness which stands at the supremesummit of Being (parakas(ha). It is attained by a process of ascentthrough higher levels or, in other words, through increasingly expandedstates of consciousness, until we reach the highest and most completestate of expansion possible (pumavikasa). The Supreme Lord restsat the end of the expansion or evolution of objectivity from the lowestlevel to the supramental state (unmana) of pure consciousness.73This supreme state is named variously in the differing traditionssyncretised into Kashmiri Saivism. Thus Bhairava (the 'wrathful' formof Siva) figures as the supreme God in Abhinavagupta's works whenhe deals with the doctrine and ritual of the Kaula schools (includingTrika and Krama) and those in various ways linked to them. This maleprinciple is associated with corresponding female ones such as Kail,KalasankarsinI (the 'Attractress of Time'), Matrsadbhava (the 'Essenceof Subjectivity') and Para (the 'Supreme'). In the Spanda school thesupreme male deity is Siva Who is also called Saiikara, while Spandais by some identified with the Goddess. When no sectarian distinctionsare intended, the supreme is simply called Paramesvara (the SupremeLord), Paramasiva or just Siva.74Saiva IdealismInteriority {antaratva) is the keynote of both Kashmiri Saivametaphysics and practice: it is a 'doctrine which maintains that everythingis internal' {antararthavada).15 Everything, according to this view,resides within one absolute consciousness. It is the great abode of theuniverse.76 Full (puma) of all things, it sustains them all and embracesthem within its infinite, all-pervasive nature. Utpaladeva writes:O Lord, some, greatly troubled, move perplexed {bhramanti) withinthemselves while others, well established [in themselves], wander inthat which is their own Self alone.77All events are consciously experienced happenings.

As Jayaratha says:Just as images manifest in a mirror, for example, are essentiallymere appearances, so too are [phenomena] manifest within conscious-ness. Thus, beause they are external, [phenomena] have no being (sattva)of their own. The Lord says this [not with the intention of sayinganything about the nature of things] but in order to raise the level ofconsciousness of those people who are attached to outer things; thuseverything in this sense is essentially a mere appearance. [Knowing this],in order to quell the delusion of duality, one should not be attached toanything external.79The ultimate experience is the realisation that everything is containedwithin consciousness. We can discover this in two ways. Either we mergethe external world into the inner subject, or we look upon the outer as agross form of the inner. In these two ways we come to recognise thatall things reside within our own consciousness just as consciousnessresides within them.This all-embracing inwardness is only possible if there is an essentialidentity between the universe and consciousness. The events whichconstitute the universe are always internal events happening withinconsciousness because their essential nature is consciousness itself.80We can only account for the fact that things appear if there is an essentialidentity between consciousness and the object perceived.81 If a physicalobject were really totally material, that is, part of a reality independentof, and external to, consciousness, it could never be experienced.82Abhinava says:The existence or non-existence of phenomena within the domainof the empirical (iha) cannot be established unless they rest withinconsciousness. In fact, phenomena which rest within consciousnessare apparent (prakasamana). And the fact of their appearing is itselftheir oneness {abheda) with consciousness because consciousness isnothing but the fact of appearing (prakasa). If one were to say that theywere separate from the light of [that consciousness] and that theyappeared [it would be tantamount to saying that] 'blue' is separate fromits own nature. However, [insofar as it appears and is known as such]one says: 'this is blue1. Thus, in this sense, [phenomena] rest in conscious-ness; they are not separate from consciousness.83"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"48  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe universe and consciousness are two aspects of the whole, justas quality and substance constitute two aspects of a single entity. Theuniverse is an attribute (dharma) of consciousness which bears (dharmiri)it as its substance.It is said that 'substance' is that resting in which this entire groupof categories manifests and is made effective. Now, if you don't get angry[we insist that] this entire class of worlds, entities, elements and categories(tattvd) rests in consciousness and [resting in it] is as it is.84Thus consciousness contains everything in the sense that it is theground or basis (ddhara) of all things, their very being (satta) andsubstance from which they are made. But, unlike the Brahman of theAdvaita Vedanta, it is not the real basis (adhisthana) of an unrealprojection or illusion. Consciousness and its contents are essentiallyidentical and equally real. They are two forms of the same reality.Consciousness is both the substratum and what it supports: The perceivingawareness and its object.85 In this respect, the Kashmiri Saiva is franklyand without reserve an idealist. Although he does not deny the realityof the object, his position is at odds with most commonly acceptedforms of realism. The realist maintains that the content perceived isindependent of the act of perception. The content is only accidentallyan object of perception and undergoes no change in the process of beingperceived. His contention, however, is essentially unverifiable; to verifyit, we would have to know an object without perceiving it. This, from theKashmiri Saiva point of view, is not possible. Objects of which we haveno knowledge may indeed exist, but they are knowable as objects onlyif they are related to subjects who perceive them. In this sense, if therewere no subjects, there could be no objects.86 The subject, however, asopposed to the object is, in terms of the phenomenology of perception,apparent to himself. He is self-luminous (svaprakasa). Thus, conscious-ness (the essence of subjectivity) is one's own awareness by virtue of whichall things exist.87The realist maintains that consciousness clearly differs from its objectinsofar as their properties are contrary to each other. The Saivite idealist.however, says that the object is a form of awareness (vijnanakara)**The objective status of the object is cognition itself.89 Perceptionmanifests its object and renders it immediately apparent (sphuta) to thosewho perceive it.90 It does not appear at any other time.91 If 'blue' wereto exist apart from the cognition of 'blue\\ two things would appear:'blue' and its cognition, which is not the case.92 It is the perception ofthe object which constitutes its manifest nature. An entity becomes an"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  49object of knowledge not by virtue of the entity itself but by our knowledgeof it. If objects had the property of making other objects appear, itwould be possible for one object to make another appear in its ownlikeness. 'Blue' is perceived to be 'blue' because it is manifest as suchto the perceiver.93 As Abhinava points out:The [nature of an] object of knowledge could not be establishedthrough a means of knowledge totally unrelated to it—a crow does notbecome white because a swan [sitting next to it] is white.94Perception, on the other hand, is immediately apparent to conscious-ness. It is self-luminous in the sense that it is directly known withoutneed of being known by any ulterior acts of perception and makes itsobject known at the same time.95 Adopting the Buddhist Yogacaradoctrine that things necessarily perceived together are the same (sahopa-lambhaniyamavada), the Saivite affirms that because the perceived isnever found apart from perception, they are in fact identical.96 Reality(satya) is the point where the intelligible and the sensible meet in thecommon unity of being; it cannot be said to exist in itself outside, and apartfrom, knowledge or vision. Bhagavatotpala in his commentary on theStanzas on Vibration quotes:Once the object is reduced to its authentic nature, one knows [thetrue nature of] consciousness. What then [remains of] objectivity?What [indeed could be] higher than consciousness?97Consciousness is essentially active. Full of the vibration of its ownenergy engaged in the act of perception, it manifests itself externallyas its own object. When the act of perception is over, consciousnessreabsorbs the object and turns in on itself to resume its undifferentiatedinner nature.98Knowledge (jnana) manifests internally and externally as eachindividual entity .... Once knowledge has assumed that form it fallsback [into itself]99The Yogacara Buddhist similarly maintains that consciousnesscreates its own forms. But, according to him, because the perceived andperception are identical, there is no perceived object at all. The so-calledouter world is merely a flux of cognitions, it is not real. He is firmlycommitted to a doctrine of illusion. The reality of consciousness from"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONhis point of view is established by proving the unreality of the universe.\"All this consists of the act of consciousness alone\", says Vasubandhu,\"because unreal entities appear, just as a man with defective vision seesunreal hair or a moon, etc.\".100He points to dreams as examples of purely subjective constructswhich appear to be objective realities. The apparent reality dreamspossess is not derived from any concrete, objective world, but merelyfrom the idea of objectivity. While the Yogacara does not say that anidea has, for example, spatial attributes, it does have a form manifestingthem. While he agrees with the Saiva idealist that appearances have noindependent existence apart from their appearing to consciousness,he maintains that for this reason they are unreal. The creativity ofconsciousness consists in its diversification in many modes havingapparent externality; it is not a creation of objects.While the Kashmiri Saivite agrees that the world is pure conscious-ness alone, he maintains that it is such because it is a real creation ofconsciousness. The effect is essentially identical with the cause andshares in its reality. Matter and the entire universe are absolutely real,as 'congealed' (sty ana) or 'contracted' (samkucita) forms of consciousness.\"This God of consciousness\", writes K§emaraja, \"generates the universeand its form is a condensation of His own essence (rasa).'''101 By boilingsugarcane juice it condenses to form treacle, brown sugar and candywhich retains its sweetness. Similarly, consciousness abides unchangedeven though it assumes the concrete material form of the five grosselements.102 The same reality thus abides equally in gross and subtleforms.103 Consequently no object is totally insentient. Even stones beara trace (vasana) of consciousness, although it is not clearly apparentbecause it is not associated with the vital breath (prana) and othercomponents of a psycho-physical organism.104 Somananda goes sofar as to affirm that physical objects, far from being insentient, canonly exist insofar as they are aware of themselves as existing.105 Thejar performs its function because it knows itself to be its agent.106 Indeed,all things are pervaded by consciousness and at one with it and henceshare in its omniscience.107 Thus, Siva, Who perceives Himself in theform of physical objects, is the one ultimate reality.108\"The jar knows because it is of my nature\", writes Somananda,\"and I know it because I am of the jar's nature. 1 know because I am ofSadasiva's nature and He knows because He is of my nature; Yajnadatta[knows] because he is of Siva's nature and Siva [knows] because Heis of Yajnadatta's nature\".I09"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  51Everything in this sense is directly perceived by absolute conscious-ness, and this direct perception (pratyaksa) unifies the knowable intoa single, undivided whole. This is the central concept behind a doctrineoriginally expounded by Narasimha called 'the non-dualism of directperception' (pratyaksddvaita).110 This states that consciousness isessentially perceptive and that its perception of all things operatesthroughout the universe.111 Insofar as phenomena are clearly evident(sphufa) to us, everything is directly perceived by absolute consciousness,with which our individual consciousness is identical. This directperception unfolds everywhere; the one true reality, it is alone andwithout companion or rival (nihsapatna). Even though it remains one,it can, by its very nature, perceive distinctions (bheda) between oneentity and another, without this engendering any division within it.112We distinguish between two entities in empirical terms on thebasis of their mutual exclusion (anyonydbhdva). The relative distinction(bheda) between them is essentially the perceived difference betweentheir respective characteristics. Despite this difference they are unitedwithin the purview of a single cognition insofar as they are equallyboth manifest appearances. This cognition is the undivided essence(rasa) or 'own nature' (svabhdva) of both. Encompassed by the 'fire ofconsciousness', there is no essential difference between them. Justas when an emerald and ruby reflect each other's light, the ruby isreddish-green and the emerald greenish-red, similarly everything isconnected with everything else as part of the single variegated (vicitra)cognition of absolute consciousness.113 Mahesvarananda writes:The Supreme Lord's unique state of emotivity (asadharanabhava)is the outpouring of pure Being (mahdsatta). It is manifest as thebrilliance (sphuratta) of the universe which, if we ponder deeply, [isrealized to be] the single flavour (ekarasa) of the essence of Beautywhich is the vibration of the bliss of one's own nature.114In this way all things are in reality one although divided from theone another sharing as they do the 'single flavour' (ekarasa) of the purevibration of consciousness.Kashmiri Saiva RealismKashmiri Saivism as a whole has been variously called a form of'realistic idealism',115 'monistic idealism',116 'idealistic monism'117 and'concrete monism'.118 It is easy to understand why Kashmiri Saivism is"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"52  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONsaid to be 'idealistic' and 'monistic', but in what sense is it also 'realistic*?The answer to this question is of no small importance in trying to under-stand the central idea behind its metaphysics and the fundamentalimportance of the concept of Spanda, in this seemingly impossiblemarriage between monistic idealism and pluralistic realism.The Kashmiri Saiva approach understands the world to be a symbolof the absolute, that is, as the manner in which it presents itself to us.Again we can contrast this view with that of the Advaita Vedanta. TheAdvaita Vedanta understands the world to be an expression of theabsolute insofar as it exists by virtue of the absolute's Being. Being isunderstood to be the real unity which underlies empirically manifestseparateness and as such is never empirically manifest. It is onlytranscendentally actual as 'being-in-itself. The Kashmiri Saiva positionrepresents, in a sense, a reversal of this point of view. The nature ofthe absolute, and also that of Being, is conceived as an eternal becoming(satatodita), a dynamic flux or Spanda,119 'the agency of the act ofbeing'.120 It is identified with the concrete actuality of the fact ofappearing, not passive unmanifest Being. Appearance (dbhdsa) aloneis real.121 Appearing (prakdsamdnatva) is equivalent to the fact of being(astitva).122 Ksemaraja writes in his commentary on the Stanzas onVibration:Indeed, all things are manifest because they are nothing butmanifestation. The point being that nothing is manifest apart frommanifestation.123The absolutely unmanifest, from this point of view, can have aslittle existence as the space in a lattice window of a sky-palace. Nay,even less, because even that space can appear as an imagined imagemanifest within consciousness.124 Everything is real according to themanner in which it appears.125 Even an illusion is in this sense real,insofar as it appears and is known in the manner in which it appears.The empirical and the real are identical categories of thought. AsAbhinava says:Thus this is the supreme doctrine {upanisaif), namely that, when-ever and in whatever form [an entity] appears, that then is its particularnature.126Perhaps at this stage a brief comparison with Heidegger's ideasmight prove to be enlightening and not altogether out of place. Accordingto Heidegger's phenomenology of Being, reality is intelligible in a two-fold"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  53manner as 'phenomenon' and logos'. Heidegger defines what he meansby 'phenomenon' as: \"that-which-shows-itself. The manifest . . .phenomena are then the collection of that which lies open in broaddaylight or can be brought to the light of day—what the Greeks at timesimplicitly identified as 'ta onta' (the things-which-are)\".127 In his laterwritings Heidegger drops the term 'phenomenon' in preference forthe verbal form 'phainesthai' in order to emphasize even more theactuality or presentational property of Being. Explaining this new formof the term he writes: \"Being disclosed itself to the ancient Greeks as'physis'. The etymological roots 'phy-' and 'pha-' designate the samething: 'phyein', the rising-up or upsurge which resides within itself as'phainesthai', lighting-up, self-showing, coming-out, appearing-forth.\"128Heidegger contrasted his notion of phenomenon with semblance(Scheiri) and with appearing (Erscheinung). In the case of semblance athing can show itself as that which it is not, as when fool's gold showsitself to be gold. The ancients always allied semblance with non-being.Heidegger points out, however, that semblances are grounded in showings,and so does Abhinava. Both Heidegger and Abhinava consequentlymaintain that all semblances have a real basis and are to be treated asinstances of phenomena along with the so-called real showing ormanifestation of non-deceptive objects. So Heidegger states that: 'how-ever much seeming, *just that much being'.129 Thus self-showing orappearing defines Being as phenomenon, but this definition of Beingis as yet incomplete. Being is not only self-showing but 'logos' whichHeidegger explains means 'discourse' (Rede) in the sense of'apophansis':'letting-be-seen'. Phenomenology, which according to Heidegger isthe only correct study of Being, means 'letting-be-seen-that-which-shows-itself. This is true of Saiva Paramadvaita as well.The reality of the world demands recognition; we are forced toaccept the direct presentation of the fact of our daily experience. AsAbhinava says: \"if practical life, which is useful to all persons at all times,places and conditions were not real, then there would be nothing leftwhich could be said to be real.\"130 A thousand proofs could not make'blue' other than the colour blue.131 The reality of whatever appears inconsciousness cannot be denied. Objects appear; they do not cease todo so by a mere emphatic denial.132 The manifestation of an entityin its own specific form is a fact at one level of consciousness; it is real.The appearing of the same entity in the same form but recognised to be adirect representation of the absolute is also a fact, but at another levelof consciousness.133 It is no more or less real than the first. 'As is thestate of consciousness, so is the experience,' says Abhinava.134 Althoughthe nature of the absolute is discovered at a higher level of consciousness,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"54  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONnonetheless it presents itself to us directly in the specific form in whichwe perceive things; otherwise there would be no way in which we couldpenetrate from the level of appearing to that of its source and basis.Abhinava writes:Real is the entity (vastu) that appears in the moment of directperception (sak$atkara), that is to say, within our experience of it.Once its own specific form has been clearly determined one should,with effort, induce it to penetrate into its pure conscious nature.135All things are known to be just as they present themselves. Theconcrete actuality of being known (pramiti), irrespective of content,is itself the vibrant (spandd) actuality of the absolute. Liberatingknowledge is gained not by going beyond appearances but by attendingclosely to them. \"The secret,\" Mahesvarananda says, \"is that liberationwhile alive (jlvanmukti) is the profound contemplation of Maya'snature.\"136 No ontological distinction can be drawn between the absoluteand its manifestations because both are an appearing {abhasa), the latterof diversity and the former of 'the true light of consciousness which isbeyond Maya and is the category Siva'.137Those who have attained the category of Pure Knowledge aboveMaya and have thus gone beyond the category of Maya, see the entireuniverse as the light of consciousness . . . Just as the markings [on afeather] are nothing apart from the feather, the feather [is nothing apartfrom] them, similarly, when the light of consciousness is manifest, thewhole group of phenomena is manifest as the light of consciousnessitself.'38Within the sphere of Maya, every entity's 'own nature' (svabhdva)corresponds to its specific manifest form. Accordingly it is defined asthat which distinguishes it from all else and from which it never deviates.139Above the sphere of Maya, that is, above the level of objectivity, is thedomain of the subject. At this level, everything is realised to be partof the fullness of the experiencer140 and hence no longer bound by theconditions which impinge on the object. Here the part is discoveredto be the whole, that is, consciousness in toto. In this sphere beyondrelative distinctions, the yogi realises that (all) the categories of existenceare present in every single category.141 The yogi experiences everyindividual particular as the sum total of everything else. He recognisesthat all things have one nature and that every particular is all things.142This is the 'essence' {sard) or co-extensive unity (samarasya) of all things."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  55We have established that reality is manifest according to how[and the degree in which] the freedom of consciousness reveals it andthat [this freedom] is the womb of all forms. Just as 'sweetness' is presentin its entirety in every atom of the sugarcane, so each and every atom[of the universe] bears within itself the emanation of all things.143This is the level of consciousness in which the absolute reflects onitself realising to its eternal delight and astonishment (camatkara) itsown integral nature.144 The reality of the world of diversity is not denied,but experienced in a new mode of awareness free of time and space inthe eternal omnipresence of the Here and Now.[Phenomenal forms of awareness] such as 'this [exists]', born ofthe colouring [imparted to the absolute] by the limitations engenderedby the diversifying power of time (kalakalana) also emanate within theSupreme Principle. There [at that level], Fullness (purriata) is the onenature [of all things] and so everything is omnipresent; otherwise,associated with division (khand*ana\\ the Fullness [of the absolute]would not be full.145The content of absolute consciousness consists of diverse appearings(ahhdsa) which, because they are manifest through it in this way, donot compromise the wholeness of consciousness. Everything we perceiveis a momentary collocation of a number of such manifestations whichcombine together like 'a row of altar lamps' (dipavall) to form the singleradiant picture of the universe. The individual objects which constitutethe universe are specific collocations of such 'atomic'appearings. Togetherthey form a single unified particular which appears according to its owndefining features (svalaksana). A jar, for example, consists of a numberof appearances such as 'round', 'fat', 'earthen', 'red', etc., which togetherdischarge a single function (arthakriya), in this case, that of carrying theappearance 'water'. They unite with each other much as the scatteredrays of a lamp come together when focused, or as the various currentsof the sea together give rise to waves.146 Atomic appearings can combinein any number of ways, provided that they are not contrary to one anotheras established by the dictates of natural law (niyati). An appearanceof 'form', for example, cannot combine with that of 'air'.147Insofar as they share a common basis (samanyadhikaranya), agiven cluster of appearances appears as a single whole. This commonbasis is the most prominent member of the group; the appearance 'jar*is such in the example quoted above. Any one appearance in a clustermay assume a more important or subordinate role.

It is a different kind of appearance characterised byits association with the appearance of the specific location and time inwhich it is made manifest.149 The form of our experience is thus 'I nowsee this here'.150 But when we perceive each particular constituentappearance separately, each assumes a separate fixed function. Abhinavacites the following colourful example to illustrate how the variouscombinations of appearances account for the variety of experience:Thus even though the appearance of the beloved may manifestexternally, it is as if far away in the absence of another appearance,namely, that of 'embracing'. So when the [appearing of the beloved]is associated with another appearance [namely that of 'far away'] thepower (arthakriya) it formerly had of giving pleasure appears as itscontrary.151The form our experience assumes depends, not only on the natureof the object perceived, but also on personal factors entirely peculiar toourselves. This theory explains this in two ways. In one sense, the objectremains the same, but one or other of its constituent appearances comesto the fore according to the inclinations of the perceiver. From anotherpoint of view, we can say that the perceived object is different for eachperceiver according to the difference in the prominent appearancemanifest to him. Abhinava, citing as an example a golden jar, illustrateshow the same object appears differently to different perceivers accordingto the use they wish to make of it and to their state of mind:When a person who is depressed and feels that there is nothing[of value for him in the world] sees the jar, he merely perceives theappearance 'exists' [in the form of the awareness that] 'it is'. He is notconscious of any other [of its constituent appearances] at all. Anindividual who desires to fetch water [perceives] the appearance 4jar\\The man who simply wants something that can be taken somewhereand then brought back, [perceives] the appearance 'thing'. The manwho desires money [perceives] the appearance 'gold'. The man whodesires a pleasing object [perceives] the appearance 'brightness' whilehe who wants something solid sees the appearance 'hardness'.152These 'atomic events' or appearances emerge from the pure subject'sconsciousness and combine together to form a total event at each moment."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Integral Monism of Kashmiri Saivism  57Daily life (vyavahdra) goes on by virtue of this ever renewed flux ofappearances.153 They are connected together and work towards a singleunified experience because they appear within the field of consciousnessof the universal subject.The aggregate of appearances arises in the [supreme] subject asdo [sprouts in] a rice field. Even though each sprout germinates fromits own seed, they are perceived as a collective whole.154Appearances rest in this way within the universal subject. 'External-ity' is itself another appearance;155 it arises from a distinction betweenappearances and the individual subject.156 So, although all manifestationalways occurs within the subject, it appears to be external due to thepower of Maya157 which separates the individual subject from hisobject. This split must occur for daily life to be possible. Only externallymanifest appearances can perform their functions; when they are mergedwithin the subject and at one with him, they cannot do so.158 Dailylife proceeds on the basis of the operation and withdrawal of the conditionsnecessary for fruitful action to be possible.

Thus, although the original formulation of the Doctrineof Vibration differs from the theology of Recognition in this respect,it was extended in the course of its development to accommodate thisconcept of the absolute as well.

This supra-temporal activity characterises it most specifically; devoid of it, it wouldbe no better than an inert physical phenomenon.5 At the same time,this light is the conjunction (slesa) or oneness (aikdtmya) of its countlessmanifest forms,6 and the collective whole (sampintfana) of all thecategories of existence.7 The universe is nothing but the shining ofthe Light within itself. It is the radiant vibration (sphuratta) of thisLight, the state (avasthdna) in which consciousness becomes manifest.8Although the Light shines as all things at all times and hence alsomakes their diversity manifest,9 penetrating each object individuallyas well as collectively, it is not totally 'merged' (magna) or identifiedwith the object so as to suffer any division within itself.10 Our experienceof any object is of the form: i see this': it is not itself an object, but themanifest form the object assumes as a luminous principle of experience.11The Light is ever revealed and can never be obscured; objectivity cannever cast a shadow on the light of consciousness.12 The Stanzas onVibration declare:That in which all this creation is established and from whence itarises is nowhere obstructed because it is unconditioned by [its very]nature.13This Light is the highest reality (paramdrtha). It is the 'AncientLight' (purdnaprakdsa) that makes all things new and fresh everymoment.14 It is 'always new and secret, ancient and known to all'.15It is the form of the Present (yartamdnarupd), the Eternal Now.

But this Light isthe shining of the absolute, it is not an impersonal principle. It is theliving Light of God, indeed it is God Himself,17 the Master Who instructsthe entire universe.18 Siva is this 'auspicious lamp', Who illuminesall things.19 He is the Light of consciousness that reveals the presenceof both the real and the unreal, of'light'and 'darkness'.20 Abhinavaguptawrites:Thus Bhairava, the Light, is self-evident (svatahsiddha); withoutbeginning, He is the first and last of all things, the Eternal Present.And so what else can be said of Him? The unfolding of the categoriesof existence (tattva) and creation, which are the expansion of His ownSelf, He illumines, luminous with His own Light, in identity withHimself, and because He illumines Himself, so too He reflects on Hisown nature, without His wonder (camatkard) being in any waydiminished.21The Kashmiri Saiva concept of consciousness is clearly more akinin the West to the Christian mystic's understanding of the nature ofDeity than to that of consciousness as conceived by most westernpsychologists and philosophers of mind. Dionysius the Aeropagite talksof God, in the passage cited below, in much the same terms as theKashmiri Saivite would about the light of absolute consciousness.[God] being One communicates His unity into every part of theworld and also unto the Whole, both unto that which is one and thatwhich is many. He is One and unchangeable in a superessential mannerbeing neither a multiplicity of things, nor yet the sum total of suchunits .... He is a unity in a manner far different from this ... He isindivisible plurality, insatiable, yet brimful, producing, perfectingand maintaining all unity and plurality.22The central mystical experience of enlightenment is aptly symbolisedby light in most of the numerous forms of mysticism; Deity and all thatsurrounds the higher reaches of existence are universally symbolised bylight. The vision of Light is one of the most characteristic features ofhigher mystical experiences. When the Kashmiri Saiva talks of Deityor ReaUty as Light, he is trying to express his direct experience of theReal; this is more important to the mystic than any concept of reality.The yogi's concern is realisation, not philosophical speculation ortheological discussion.If the mystic is to traverse the boundary between the transitory and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"62  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthe eternal, he must die to the profane condition.

The new condition carries with itmore insight, which is symboiised by more light. It is a vision of theworld radiant with the light and life of the divine reality within allthings, and yet beyond them. The most profoundly satisfying experiencepossible is the recognition that the light of one's own consciousnessis all things.\"[This] Bliss\", writes Abhinava, \"is not like the intoxication ofwine or that of riches, nor similar to union with the beloved. Themanifestation of the light of consciousness is not like the ray of lightfrom a lamp, sun or moon. When one frees oneself from accumulatedmultiplicity, the state of bliss is like that of putting down a burden;the manifestation of the Light is like the acquiring of a lost treasure,the domain of universal non-duality.\"23This is the central experience upon which the Kashmiri Saivabases his understanding of the nature of reality. In the transition fromexperience (mysticism) to a concept of reality (metaphysics), we canonly carry with us ideas symbolic of the original experience. Philosophy,from this point of view, can only serve a descriptive function. It is a'systematic symbolism' which serves primarily to generate insight intothe nature of reality by a process of elevating the philosopher's powerof recognition (pratyabhijna), allowing him to couple the conceptwith the experience which lies behind it.Philosophy is an elaboration of different kinds of spiritualexperiences. The abstractions of high-grade metaphysics are basedon spiritual experience and derive their whole value from the experiencesthey symbolise. No metaphysical concept is entirely intelligible withoutreference to the spirit.24Light (prakasa), Sound (nada), Vibration (spanda), Taste (rasa)and a host of others all serve this symbolic function in this universe ofdiscourse. Amongst these, Light (prakasa) and Vibration (spanda)feature prominently. Light symbolism helps us to grasp the innerrelationship between things understood as integral parts of the absolutein static juxtaposition and mutual interpenetration. Vibration (spanda)symbolism serves to represent the dynamic, self-regenerative character"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 63of the absolute. It symbolises the active participation of the infinitein the finite as the process of its transformation into the finite and thereconversion of the finite into the infinite. Space is the model for theformer and time for the latter. Light aptly symbolises an absoluteconceived as a pure noetic plenum. The absolute is called 'Light' becauseit is the universal knowledge of the supreme subject which makes theentire knowable manifest.25 It represents consciousness as the unchangingwitness of all the events in the universe, the power of the absolute toknow the universe (Jnanasakti) merged within it:We bow to Siva Who eternally illumines by the lamp of the powerof his knowledge the many objects lying in the Great Cave of Maya.26In the cognitive sphere, the dynamic character of the light ofconsciousness is represented by the flux of cognitions. This is thepulsation—Spanda—of its noetic activity (jnanatmikakriya) of whichit is itself the conscious agent (kartr) as well as perceiver. Knowledgecannot exist independently of the knower.27 The object is grounded inknowledge and knowledge in the subject which thus connects themtogether like a powerful glue.28 Ultimately, these three are identical:Nothing perceived is independent of perception and perceptiondiffers not from the perceiver, therefore the universe is nothing but theperceiver [himself].29The one universal consciousness, therefore, has three aspects: itis the illuminator (prakasaka), the illumined universe (prakasya) andthe light of knowledge (prakasa) which illumines it. The universe,Light and Self are one.30 Subject, object and means of knowledgenecessarily attend each act of perception and make cognitive awareness(prama) possible. Manifested by the creative power (srsjisakti) of theGreat Light,31 they are always present together whenever anythingis perceived objectively, and so embrace, as it were, the entire universein their nature:32The group of subjects, the various means of knowledge, the multiplekinds of knowledge and the objects of knowledge—all this is conscious-ness alone. The Supreme Goddess is the absolute freedom of our ownconsciousness which assumes these various forms.33When they are made manifest, the universe appears within thefield of universal consciousness. When they cease to operate, and the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONtension between subject and object is resolved again into their primordialunity, the universe is again withdrawn into undifferentiated consciousness.Thus the devout yogi addresses the divine Light with the words:Your playful desire is the cause of the diversity between theperceiver, perceiving, perception and perceptible; when Your playfuldesire is over, that diversity disappears somewhere. Seldom doesman realise this.34As aspects of the dynamic consciousness (caitanya) which is Siva'sfreedom to act as the agent of cognition,35 they are phases of His vibration(spanda). This movement of conscious energy, incandescent with thelight of consciousness, generates cognitions that appear as manifestations(abhdsa) of consciousness within it. Thus, taken together as a singlewhole, they are the inner light of the innate nature of all things (svarupa-jyotis).}b United, they are the supreme subject (parapramatr) identifiedwith the state of pure awareness (pramitibhava) that constitutes theiressence. This higher subject is Paramasiva Who assumes these threeaspects through a process of self-limitation (samkoca), all the whilecontinuing to exist as the undifferentiated unity of pure consciousness.37As aspects of the light of consciousness, these three are appropriatelysymbolised as three great luminaries, namely, the Fire, Sun and Moon.38The means of knowledge, like the Sun, illumines the object. The objectshines, like the Moon, by its reflected light. Again, like the moon,according to the common Indian way of thinking, it exudes nectar in thesense that the object delights the senses.39 Fire aptly symbolises thesubject because fire is said to have three abodes, as ordinary fire onearth, as lightning in the sky and the god of fire in heaven. The subjecttoo is three-fold as the object, the means of knowledge and the subjectitself. Moreover the subject, like fire, flames upwards, consuming allthings within the pervasive field of its consciousness, ultimately digestingthem within itself when perception is over and he rests tranquil.Even though the light of consciousness experiences all three, it doesnot require another to be perceived, but illumines itself in the courseof making the universe manifest. Consciousness is the ultimate principleof revelation. The Light that reveals everything does not require asecond for its own revelation.40 If consciousness were not self-consciousbut required another consciousness to reveal its nature, that too wouldrequire another and the third a fourth and so on ad infinitum.41This Light, as we have seen, unfolds or expands (prasarati) every-where, shining this way and that as each particular aspect of ourexperience.

At the same time He abides unchanged as the supremeexperiencer. Rajanaka Rama in his commentary on the Stanzas onVibration writes:If we could anywhere, at any time, or in any way conceive of Youapart from [universal] manifestation, then we could say that Yourdiversity (vicitrata) is due to the diverse limiting conditions {upadhi)[that reflect Your light] like outer crystal.42The formless, pervasive nature of consciousness makes it possiblefor objects to be related to each other. The Light (prakasa) does notexhaust itself as the luminosity of the outer object, for although everyobject is separate from every other, it is not totally unrelated to otherobjects. We do in fact experience a variety of objects in a single actof perception.43 This is only possible if the light of consciousness isfundamentally one and the same for each object. Even so, the KashmiriSaiva denies that consciousness is a formless (nirakara), undividedreality, set apart from the object it perceives. We know from our ownexperience that consciousness does not view all things equally; someobjects are more clearly apparent than others.44 Moreover, if the Light(prakasa) were to be one and entirely homogeneous, there would be nodifference between the knowledge of 'blue' and that of'yellow'.45 Objectswould become confused with one another and the world of perceptionswould collapse into a chaos (samkara).46 How could the same Lightby virtue of which we know 'blue1 to be 'blue', illumine 'yellow' so thatwe know it to be 'yellow', if consciousness were in no way affected bythe object perceived?47 The way we experience things is therefore onlyexplicable if we agree that the Light which illumines them is somehowboth formless and omniform at the same time.We can explain how consciousness can have these two aspects onlyif we admit that it is free to be both single and diverse.48 It cannot bejust one or the other for then we would have to posit the existence of asecond reality to make up for the deficiency of one or other of these twoaspects. Indeed, we cannot say that the Light is either single or diversefor that would imply a division (bheda) within it.49 One way for solvingthis problem, without recourse to some form of dualism, is to saythat unity alone is real and that diversity is merely apparent. All thatexists is consciousness which seems to assume diverse forms. Thisis the Advaitin's view.We can, however, approach this problem in a different way through"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"66  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONa deeper understanding of the properties of consciousness. The lightof consciousness is absolute and hence free of the limitations inherentin all that is relative. This freedom from limitations characterises theLight most specifically.50 It is by virtue of this freedom that it is notbound to a single fixed form, as are common objects.51 Vibrant withlife, the Light assumes countless forms. Pure consciousness is equivalentto absolute freedom. A lifeless unconscious object, on the contrary,is hemmed in on every side by spatial and temporal limitations. Unlikethe light of consciousness, it is not free to be other than the form inwhich it appears to be.According to the dualist Samkhya consciousness is always formless.It is matter that assumes diverse forms although it remains substantiallythe same, as does the clay from which pots of different sizes and shapeare fashioned. This cannot be correct, says the Kashmiri Saiva, becausematter, however subtle we may conceive it to be, is objective and, assuch, cannot be both one and diverse. Our experience testifies to thefact that 'the states of unity and division are distinct in all objectivephenomena'.52 But as Abhinava writes:Both characteristics, unity and diversity, are found in that whichdoes not fall to the level of an object but which, because it is conscious-ness, is the supremely real Light. It has only one characteristic, namely,consciousness which is the perfect medium of reflection (svaccha).This is what experience tells us.53The experience we all have to which Abhinava is alluding in thispassage is that we perceive various objects in the scan of one perceptionwithout it being divided. The same holds true of the universal perceptionabsolute consciousness has of the universe. Accordingly, the Light ofSiva's consciousness is symbolically conceived to be an infinite, perfectlypolished (svaccha) mirror within which the entire universe is reflected.In this way the Kashmiri Saiva explains how the one conscious realitycan at once be immanent and transcendent without this either com-promising its unity or denying the reality of the manifest universe.Abhinava quotes a Tantra as saying:Deity is both formless and omniform, pervading all things bothmoving and immobile, as does water or a mirror [the image reflectedin it].54Consciousness, like a mirror, can reflect objects within itself. Ithas the power to manifest entities that are separate from it as if they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 67were one with it, without this in any way affecting its nature.55 Conversely,it also makes manifest these reflected images as if they were distinctfrom it although they are not.56 Again, the variety of manifest forms(abhasa) appear separate from one another, without this compromisingthe oneness of consciousness, just as happens with the reflections in amirror.57 However, in one respect at least, the mirror analogy does nothold good. Reflections in a mirror correspond to outer objects; thisis not the case with consciousness. The All (visva) is entirely a reflection(pratibimbamatra).5* From the point of view of consciousness, theoriginal object is as much a reflection as the image reflected in the mirror.Although the universe is like a reflection, there is no object outside themirror of consciousness that, reflected within it, appears as the universe.Abhinava points out:The image reflected [in a mirror] is deposited [there] by the originalexternal object. Now, if this too is a reflected image, what remainsof the original object?59The object apprehended by the senses cannot be the original objectbecause the perception of the object is never immediate; it occurs througha series of causes.60 The perception of the object is real enough, but itis always perceived as a reflection within the mind and senses. An outerworld may indeed exist, but the form in which it appears is always as areflection, never as the original object. An opponent may object thatno reflection can exist without an original reflected object. Abhinavareplies that this is true of reflections in a mirror but not of those withinconsciousness. Anyway, even in the case of a mirror, the object isnever one with the reflected image.61 Nor are they one in the way that aparticular can be said to be one with its universal.62 Moreover, whenwe perceive a reflection in a mirror, we do not perceive the originalobject at the same time. The cognition of one follows the other; theyare not simultaneous. Similarly, we hear an echo when the originalsound has ceased,63 and we can perceive a shadow without seeing thehand that makes it.64 The bashful maiden can secretly view the charmingform of her lover standing behind her, reflected in a mirror withouthaving to IoGk at him directly.65 Thus Abhinava prefers to cut shortall argument and boldly state:If then, even though [the universe] clearly bears the characteristics[of a reflected image], you still insist on calling it the original object(bimbo), go ahead. The wise attend to the facts, not to commonlyaccepted convention.66"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe only way to account for the appearing of this cosmic reflectionis to accept that consciousness itself creates it spontaneously. Conscious-ness is free (svatantra) to be 'the agent of the act of manifestation'.67Consciousness in this sense is the cause of both the original object andits reflection.68 Otherwise, if this were not the case, we would be forcedto seek another reality apart from consciousness which deposits thesereflections within it;69 as this is impossible, nothing would appear at all.Abhinava concludes:The truth is therefore this: the Supreme Lord manifests freely(anargala) all the varied play of emissions and absorptions in the skyof His own nature.70The creation of reflections within the mirror of consciousness isspontaneous, like play. In the Spanda tradition, Ksemaraja personifiesthe power of consciousness that plays the game of manifestation as theGoddess Spanda. Consciousness is the fecund womb from which allthings are born and in which they ultimately unite to rest blissfully.71The Goddess is therefore not just the power of consciousness thatgenerates the cosmic reflection, but is also the mirror in which it appears.Thus it is the Goddess Spanda Who is:the Lord's power of freedom that, although undivided,displays on the screen of Her own nature all the cycles of creation anddestruction. [She reflects them within Herself] in such a way thatalthough they are at one with Her, they appear to be separate fromHer, like a city reflected in a mirror .... Therefore, the Supreme Beingis always one with the Spanda principle and never otherwise.72The vibration of consciousness is manifest as the forms whichemerge within it. In the mental, subjective sphere, these include thoughts,memories and cognitions; in the objective sphere objects, universalsand words—none of which could exist if consciousness did not havethe power to generate them. Thus our exposition of the Kashmiri Saivaconcept of the absolute as Light and its manifestations as reflectionshas led us to consider its universal power apparent through its recurringpulsations of activity. This same power both generates forms withinitself and is conscious of them. Therefore, this, the absolute's power ofself-awareness, to which we now turn, is also Spanda—its vibration."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 69Self-Awareness and ConsciousnessAs we have seen, the absolute is the light of consciousness (prakasa)because it makes all things manifest by shining in its universal form.The phenomena that appear in the field of consciousness are experienceddirectly in this way at the initial instant of perception when they arestill at one with the perceiving subject. The light of consciousness is itselfthis direct experience73 had before thought-constructs interpose them-selves between subject and object, thus degrading the latter to the levelof objectivity, which obscures the light of the subject's immediateperception. But although the light of consciousness accounts for theappearing of phenomena in this way, it does not by itself fully accountfor our experience of them. No experience is possible without self-awareness. Experience must be personal to be experience at all. AsJung suggests:Experience is not possible without reflection, because experienceis a process of assimilation without which there could be no under-standing.74From the Kashmiri Saivite point of view, this reflection is anawareness of the images that appear within the mirror of the Light.For the psycho-cosmic processes occurring at the level of universalconsciousness (samvid) to be accessible to experience, consciousnessmust reflect (literally fcbend back') on itself to know itself and whatappears within it:The Supreme Lord bears within Himself the reflection of theuniverse and the [reflection] is His nature as all things. Nor is Heunconscious of His nature as such because that which is consciousnecessarily reflects on itself.75This act of reflective awareness is termed 'vimarsa'. The word isderived from the root 'mrs' which means to touch, feel, understand,perceive, reflect or examine. Thus 'vimarsa'is the power of consciousnessby virtue of which it can understand or perceive itself, feel, reflect onand examine the events that occur within it—in short, behave like alimitless, living being. This ability to reflect on itself is inherent in thevery nature of the light of consciousness; indeed it is its most specificcharacteristic76 and the very life of its sentient nature.

Lackof awareness results in incomplete vision and divides the All into parts,each separately seen as a specific 'this' (idarri) contrasted and distinguishedfrom all that it is not. Turning away from the unity of self-awareness,we become obsessed with the part and ignore the Whole. But whenawareness rests in itself and contemplates its own nature, it sees itselfas the pure subject that unfolds as the unity of all things.88 This awareness(vimarsa) can therefore be said to have two aspects:Internal. This is the act of awareness when the light of consciousnessrests in itself alone. It is the pure awareness of T (ahamvimarsa), devoidof all thought-constructs (nirvikalpa), said to be 'total freedom andunsullied wonder'.89External. This aspect corresponds to the act of reflection directed awayfrom the subject to the object he perceives as separate from himself.Reality then becomes accessible to discursive representation (vikalpa)and amenable to empirical definition."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 71Awareness serves to relate objectivity with subjectivity in such away that the object ultimately comes to rest in the self-awareness of thesubject. In reality, reflective awareness is always awareness of T(ahamvimarsa); it never objectivises even when, in the form of theawareness of 'this' (idamvimarsa), it reflects upon the object. Theexperience we have of things existing outside consciousness is due toa lack of self-awareness. The awareness of the object is never 'out there';it is registered and known within the subject. All forms of awarenesscome to rest in the subject:\"Just as every drop of water comes to rest in the ocean, so all actsand cognitions [come to rest] in the Great Lord, the ocean of conscious-ness. Even a little water on the ground drunk by the sun's rays goes,as rain, to the great ocean. Similarly all knowledge and action in theuniverse merge in the ocean of Siva either spontaneously and evidently(sphufam), by itself or [indirectly] through a series of other [processes].\"90Individual and universal consciousness are one. The same processesoperate in both; the only difference between them is that in the case ofindividual consciousness these processes are restricted or limited(samkucita) representations of the maximally expanded (vikdsita)operation of universal consciousness. The activity of the mind is thatof consciousness itself, or to be more precise, of its reflective awareness,the power of Spanda.91 Thus, on the individual level, reflective awareness:Is the capacity of the Self to know itself in all its purity in the stateof perfect freedom from all kinds of affections; to analyse all its statesof varying affections, due either to the internal or the external causes;to retain these affections in the form of residual traces (samskara);to take out, at will, at any time, anything out of the existing stock of thesarpskaras and bring back an old affected state of itself as in the caseof remembrance; to create an altogether new state of self-affection bymaking a judicious selection from the existing stock and displayingthe material so selected on the background of the prakasa aspect asat the time of free imagination.92Cognition would be impossible if consciousness were incapableof it. This capacity is the reflective awareness it has of itself as pure Tconsciousness. When it is conditioned by the object of knowledge,which is in its turn conditioned by the forces and laws that govern thephysical universe (all of which are aspects of the power of Maya), itoperates as cognition, memory and all the other functions of the mind.93Cognition, in other words, is the reflective awareness of T limited bythe affections imposed upon it by the variety of external manifestations"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"72  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONgenerated by this T consciousness itself. Freed from all associationwith outer objects, the individual shares in God's bliss, which is theexperience He enjoys at rest in His own nature.94 This blissful self-awareness (vimarsa) is the abiding condition of the subject even whilehe perceives the world and reacts to it. It is the inner activity of theSpanda principle, which is the inspired wonder (camatkara) of conscious-ness from which the powers of will, knowledge and action flow out asphases in its vibrating rhythm {spanda).95Normally, the individual subject fails to recognise the creativenature of this flow of awareness (jnanadhara) to and from the objectin the act of cognition. He is unaware that he fashions from his ownconsciousness the various forms which populate his objective field ofawareness. On the universal level of subjectivity, however, this movementfrom inner to outer and back is experienced within consciousness asthe coming into being and destruction of the entire universe. Conse-quently, reflective awareness (vimarsa) is characterized as action(kriya) which is the flux of Becoming, while the Light (prakdsa) isknowledge (jnana) or passive Being.96 In other words, awareness isthe creative act of making reality known, while the Light is the actualityof its being known. The latter without the former would be an inactiveprinciple, a state of pure potential that could never actualize into anact of awareness. From this point of view the two aspects of awareness are:Karma Vimarsa. When the act of awareness is directed externally andcoincides with the unfolding (vikasa) of the expansion of the universe(prapanca) out of the absolute.Kriya Vimarsa. When this activity is still unlimited and infinite, com-pletely internalized within the absolute as its agency (kartrtva),undisturbed by any goal of action (karya) as the pure vibration or stir{samrambha) of consciousness.97The Saiva rejects the Vedantin's view that knowledge is incommen-surable with action. Knowledge and action together constitute the basisof daily life and the life of all living beings.98 One is never without theother; they function hand in hand. At the universal level, the power ofaction evolves forms out of the pleroma of consciousness, while thepower of knowledge makes them manifest. On the individual level, theyrepresent the objective and subjective poles of all sentient activity. Asthe inner awareness that i am' (aham), knowledge is the stable referentof all actions. It persists undivided throughout all action, howeverdiverse. If it did not, then running, for example, would be impossible,99nor would we be able to understand a sentence spoken in haste.100"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 73While our own self-awareness (svasamvedand) informs us of its existence,action, thus illumined by knowledge, is the awareness that 4I act'.Together they are the pure awareness of T (aharri) as the knowing andacting subjectivity which is the inner Spanda nature of consciousness.Awareness and the Integral Nature of the AbsoluteAlthough diverse elements may appear within consciousness, theymust be distinguished from one another. Individual appearances sharea common nature as appearances and so cannot divide themselves offfrom one another; otherwise the severed elements, disassociated fromtheir essential nature, would not appear at all.101 Established in itsown undifferentiated (avisisfa) nature, the universe would not be auniverse unless the light of consciousness itself differentiates the diverseforms it creates by its spontaneous shining. It does this by the variousways in which it reflects upon its own nature. Although the Light isalways undivided on the lower level of Maya as well as on the higherlevel of pure consciousness, the reflective awareness it has of its ownnature is not.102 Thus while Light expresses the unity of consciousness,awareness, when distinguished from it, expresses the diversity ofperceptions. At the microcosmic level we can say:The one light of consciousness consists of such types of reflectiveawareness as: 'this is a jar' and 'this is a cloth*; 'these two are dividedfrom each other and from other subjects as well as from me'.103At the macrocosmic level:The Light is the supreme reality {paramanha) that encompasses[the categories] from Earth to Paramasiva, [while] the unfolding(unme$a) of the reflective awareness of the Heart [of T consciousness]within it, distinguishes between them.104This does not mean that vimarsa is diverse. Although it is due tothe awareness of the unity or relative distinction between the phenomenaillumined by the light of consciousness that they are experienced asone or diverse, this is only possible because awareness is the same inboth cases.105 This then is another aspect of the dynamic nature ofawareness: it is the \"freedom [of consciousness] to unite, separate andhold things together.\"106 This distinguishes consciousness from inert"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"74  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONobjects \"devoid of the freedom to conjoin and disjoin.\"107 It is thevibration of consciousness which generates the universe by a processof uniting and dividing the elements contained within it in an undiffer-entiated state.108 Thus vimarsa is said to operate in four ways: (1) itnegates its true nature and (2) identifies with something else, (3) mergesboth into one and (4) denies both once they have been merged together.109These four functions correspond to three levels of reflective awareness,namely, the awareness of the separation, of the holding together andof the union of the manifestations of consciousness. First, by 'negatingits true nature and identifying with something else', consciousness,through its power of awareness, freely identifies with the psychophysicalorganism and denies its true nature as consciousness. The result is theemergence of seemingly individual locii of consciousness distinct fromthe object and from each other. Secondly, through the same power ofawareness, subject and object are held together and different objectsrelated to one another in a single field of consciousness during the actof cognition. Thirdly, the individual subject and object, together withall diversity, merge in the reflective awareness the light of consciousnesshas of its nature as the universal subject.These three levels of awareness correspond to the three-foldappearing of consciousness:Division (Bheda) corresponding to the awareness of separationbetween objects.Awareness of unity-in-difference (bhedabheda) represented by themeans of knowledge which serves as a link between the unity (abheda)of the subject and the diversity (bheda) of the object.Awareness of the undivided unity (abheda) of all things as the puresubject.These three levels are held together in the fullness (purnata) ofconsciousness as the wave of vibration (spandd) of awareness movesfrom the lower contracted level of diversity in the process of ascent(arohakrama) to the expanded state of unity, and down from unity todiversity in the process of descent (avarohakrama). We can understandthis movement from two points of view. Firstly, 'vertically'as a movementfrom the absolute down to its manifestation and back in consonancewith the emanation (sr$fi) and withdrawal (samhara) of diversity.Secondly, 'horizontally' as the movement of awareness towards andaway from the object during the act of perception. Perception servesin this way as a paradigm for cosmogenesis and as a means of realising"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Light and Awareness: Two Aspects of Consciousness 75the oneness and creativity of the absolute.An aspect of the pulsing power of awareness operates at eachlevel as a separate energy generating, sustaining and annulling thedimension of experience to which it corresponds. Thus there are threeenergies, namely, those of will, knowledge and action correspondingto the supreme (para), middling (parapara) and inferior (apara) levels.These three are emanations or aspects of the pure 4I-ness' of the un-differentiated power of the reflective awareness of consciousness.110This is the pure vibration of its Bliss which contains and pours forthall the powers operating on every plane of existence. It is the simultaneousawareness of the unity of all three planes in the oneness of undistractedcontemplation. Self-realisation is the recognition that this integral*I-ness' (purnahanta) manifests on these three levels and is the yogi'strue Siva-nature which encompasses all possible formats of experience,from the unity of transcendental consciousness to the diversity of itsimmanent manifestations.

The motion ofabsolute consciousness is a creative movement, a transition from theuncreated state of Being to the created state of Becoming. In this senseBeing is in a state of perpetual Becoming (satatodita); it constantlyphenomenalises into finite expression. The shining of inner Being is themanifestation of outer Becoming1 and, as such, is the constantly self-renewing source of its own appearing as Becoming. Thus, the universalcharacter (sdmdnya) of Being is expressed in the radiant form (sphurattd)of each phenomenon. Rightly understood, Being and Becoming are theinner and outer faces of universal consciousness which becomesspontaneously manifest, through its inherent power, as this polarity.2 Theinner face (antarmukha) of consciousness is the pure subject which, devoid•of all objective content, abides beyond the realms of time and space. TheStanzas on Vibration declare: \"That inner being is the abode ofomniscience and every other divine attribute. It can never cease to existbecause nothing else can be perceived [outside it].\"3"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"78  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe outer face of consciousness represents the diversity andcontinuous change of the manifest universe—the object.4 While the outerappears to be a distinct reality set apart from the inner, the inner containsthe totality of the outer which appears within it without dividing its nature:\"Internality\", writes Utpaladeva, \"is a state of oneness with the subject,while externality is the state of separation from it.\"5Again:Having made itself manifest consciousness abides as both the inner[subject] and outer [object]. It shines there [within itself] in such a waythat it appears to be illumining [some] other [reality].6The emergence of a particular object within the field of awareness isaccompanied by a mental representation through which the subjectidentifies the object and distinguishes it from others.7 Thus, the manner inwhich the objective universe is experienced is governed by the sameprinciples as those upon which thought is based. Phenomena follow oneanother linked in a causal chain, much as one thought leads to the next ina chain of associations (prapancd). This is not only true of individualobjects but applies equally to individual perceivers. The manifestation ofthe universe and the emergence of Becoming, consisting of both individualsubjects and objects, from the inner state of pure Being is equivalent to theemergence of thought in universal consciousness. Although introvertedand inherently free of all dichotomysing mental activity, consciousness,through its inner vibration (spanda), conceives the world-thought(visvavikalpa). As it thinks., it turns away from its pure 'I-ness'(ahantd) toplunge into its opposite—'thisness' (idanta), which is the essence of allempirically definable distinctions {bhedavyavahara). Thus the movementfrom inner to outer engenders a split within consciousness between subjectand object that gives rise to the perception of relative distinctions. Thiscorresponds to the loss of a direct, thought-free intuition of the essentialunity between inner and outer.8 In the supreme state—that is the 'inner'reality of consciousness—there is no difference between 'inner'and 'outer'.Everything is experienced as part of one, undivided compact mass ofconsciousness (samvidghana). The pure Being (satta) of universalconsciousness assumes the form of Becoming and is involved in time andspace only when a contrast appears within it between the perceiver andthe perceived:It is Lord Siva alone Who, by virtue of His freedom, playfully givesrise to the subject and the object, the enjoyer and the enjoyed, which arethe basis of every activity in this world of duality.9"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 79When the power of awareness gives rise to a sense of separationbetween subject and object with all the consequent limitations it imposesupon itself, it is called 4Maya\\ As Maya, it veils consciousness andobscures the individual subject's awareness of its essential unity.10 Whilenon-dualist Vedanta maintains that Maya is an undefinable principle thatgives rise to the cosmic illusion of multiplicity falsely superimposed on theundivided unity of the absolute, according to Kashmiri Saivism, Maya isthe power of the absolute to appear in diverse forms. The separationbetween subject and object is the product of a creative act and not of anillusion:The variety of subjects and objects with their characteristicdifferences is made manifest by the creative power of the Lord, Whoknows them.\"The creative freedom (svdtantryd) of the absolute and its deludingpower of Maya are identical. When the power of consciousness isrecognised to be the spontaneous expression of the absolute made manifestin the variety of forms it assumes without compromising its essential unity,it is experienced as the pure vibration (spanda) of its freedom. If, however,the cosmic outpouring (visvollasa) of consciousness is felt to consist ofdiverse and conflicting elements, the same power is called Maya. The fieldof operation of the freedom of the absolute is the kingdom of universalconsciousness, while that of its power of Maya is the world of trans-migratory existence. The difference between them is based on the degreeof insight we have into the nature of reality. Due to this power the objectappears to be projected outside the subject even though it is alwaysmanifest within it and is the inner reality of the object. The creation ofdiversity is accordingly defined as 'the projection (ksepa) of one's ownnature into the Self from the Self.12 Abhinava explains:Creation is to make that which shines within, externally manifestwhile it still preserves its original internal nature. Therefore [the object]must be made manifest by that in relation to which it is said to be internaland which makes the internal externally manifest.13Conversely, the moment-to-moment destruction of the objectivecontent of consciousness occurs by a reversal of the movement from innerto outer. The object, in other words, is never destroyed, but merelywithdrawn into the inner reality of the subject.14 The Spanda teachingsagree with the Buddhist doctrine of momentariness only insofar as it"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"80  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONapplies to outer objectivity.I5 Although perception and every phenomenaloccurrence can be analysed into a series of moments (ksana), daily lifecannot entirely be understood in terms of such moment-units. Change isan activity within the absolute which can only be properly understood interms of conscious action and not as a mechanical process. Each act is partof a single continuous motion which proceeds from the agent—the pureBeing of introverted consciousness—to its final completion in the result,which is the object or deed (karya). The outer reality of Becoming is theeffect which emerges from the cause, the inner reality of Being, just asaction emerges from the agent. It is a wave of activity which rises out ofthe infinite potential of the agent. Every event is a part of the greaterrhythm of the total, cosmic event. Every object is part of the universalobject and every subject shares in the agency of the universal subject.Ksemaraja writes:Hence the Lord creates and destroys only the objective aspect of theperceiver, i.e., the body, etc., but not the subjective aspect which is thelight of T consciousness because although embodied, the subject is, inreality, one with the Lord. Thus of the two—subject and object—thelatter is perishable while the former is the freedom of consciousness andimmortal. For even when the world is emanated and absorbed [thesubject] does not waver from his true nature. If he were to do so, theemanation and absorption of the world would not be manifest [for therewould be none to perceive it].16The inner is the domain of Being, where the subject's power ofknowledge (jnanasakti) operates within itself, while the outer is thedomain of the subject's power of action {kriyasakti). Knowledge turnsinto action and action leads to knowledge. Thus every individualphenomenon has two aspects: its outer form and its inner nature. Its outerform is apparent to us as the manner in which it behaves, its properties andpragmatic efficacy (arthakriya). This aspect differentiates each individualobject from other objects and renders it accessible to conceptualrepresentation (savikalpa). Its inner nature the Kashmiri Saiva equateswith its pure Being as an appearance (abhasa) within universal conscious-ness at one with pure T-ness' and hence inaccessible to conceptualrepresentation (nirvikalpa). Thus the movement from Being to Becomingis essentially an act of perception. Perception is the connecting linkbetween the outer manifest form of the object and its inner nature.

Movement (samrambha) and rest (visranti) in theabsolute presuppose one another. The freedom (svatantrya) ofconsciousness to do what seems, according to reason, to be impossibleexplains how the absolute can at once be motionless and yet full of activity.Abhinava explains:By Vibration' {spandana) [we mean] subtle movement. It is subtle[in the sense that] although it moves not, it manifests as motion. The lightof consciousness is not at all separate [from manifestation] yet it appearsto be so. Thus, that which is immobile, associated with the variety ofmanifestation, manifests [as movement].17Motion normally implies a movement between two separate points,which entails the existence of at least two distinct entities between whichmotion can occur. But as all things are equally consciousness there are notwo such distinct realities between which motion, as we understand it, cantake place. Abhinava explains that Spanda—the pulsation ofconsciousness—is defined as a 'subtle movement' {kincicc aland) because\"if that movement [were] to entail motion towards another entity, it wouldnot be 'subtle' [but merely gross motion];*if not, [on the other hand], it isnot motion at all.\"18The cosmic process consists of a cyclic series of creations anddestructions which follow one another like buckets fixed on a water-wheel.19 Although change is manifest through this process, and change isthe basis of time, the pulsation of the absolute is a movement outside theconfines of time. Siva is eternally engaged in all the phases of the creativeact simultaneously and yet performs them one after another. SoUtpaladeva sings of Siva's glory thus:Salutations to the Lord Who eternally delights in emission {srsti)and is always comfortably seated in persistence {sthiti), and is eternallysatisfied with the Three Worlds for His food.20Although the creative activity of consciousness is not divided by timeor set in space, it is the basis of all sequentially definable spatial andtemporal manifestations (desakrama and kalakramabhasa). Action,therefore, is of two kinds. The first is the kind of activity that can be"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"82  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONbroken down into a series (krama) or sequence of actions set in time andspace. The second type is the non-successive (akramika) action that takesplace within the absolute. It is the source of time and space and hencebeyond the spatial and temporal distinctions which characterize allsequences.\"Worldly action\", writes Utpaladeva, \"can be said to be successive dueto the power of time; but the eternal activity of the Highest Lord, like theHighest Lord Himself, cannot.\"21Reality contemplated from the highest (para) level of consciousnessis experienced as a single, unchanging (akrama) whole. At the lower(apara) level we experience this same reality as a sequence (krama) ofevents—as changing positions in space and a continuous transition fromone moment in time to the next. At the intermediate (parapara) level,reality is experienced at the instant of cosmic manifestation into which itblossoms with the suddenness and energy of a lightning flash.22 Thiscosmic expansion (visvasphara) occurs in a single, non-sequential flashwhich transcends both the successive change and the non-successive,simultaneous manifestation of all its phases at once.23 Ksemaraja quotesthe Sarasvatsamgraha as saying: \"This Self has shone forth but once; it isfull [of all things] and can nowhere be unmanifest.\"24Abhinava explains:Moreover, consciousness does not issue forth in succession, as dothe seed, sprout, stalk, petals, flowers and fruit, etc.. The sprout issuesfrom the seed, and the stalk from the sprout, not the seed. In this case,however, absolute consciousness (samvittattva) is manifest here in everycircumstance (sarvatah) [of daily life because] it is everywhere full andperfect. [Consciousness] is said to be the cause of all things because it iseverywhere emergent (udita) [as each manifest entity].25A sequence is only intelligible as a series of differing elements. Fromthe point of view of absolute consciousness, events do not occursuccessively. Succession (krama) depends upon difference, and differenceon the existence of a certain manifestation (abhasa) and the (simultaneous)non-existence of another.26 On the other hand, cosmic events cannot besaid to occur simultaneously either, because simultaneity of being is onlypossible between two different entities.27 In reality, succession and itsabsence are not objective properties of an entity but only formats ofperception.28 Succession is a function of time which is not to beunderstood as a self-existent reality but merely as the perception of 'prior'and 'subsequent' based on the recollection of past events in relation to thepresent or possible future events in the field of awareness. Thus"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 83Utpaladeva writes:Time is in reality nothing but the succession observable in themovement of the sun, etc., and the birth of different flowers [in their dueseason], or [the transition from] summer [to] winter.29The transition or movement of awareness from one perception to thenext is the basis of our sense of time passing. It is only possible because wesense separation between individual phenomena, both from each otherand from the individual subject. This happens when consciousness freelyobscures itself by turning away from its own self-awareness to becomeextroverted and contracted. In the essentially introverted nature ofconsciousness there is no time. Time operates within the sphere ofobjectivity; it cannot divide the inner subjectivity of consciousness.30 Tothink that time can divide consciousness is like seeking nourishment fromlumps of sugar cut from the sky by a whirling sword.31 As consciousness isthe source and basis of all appearances, it makes time manifest as well andhence cannot be affected by it.Ksemaraja insists that all talk of processes occurring within universalconsciousness in terms of a sequence of events does not really refer to theactual state of affairs (vastu), but serves merely to impart instruction aboutthe nature of consciousness in the only manner in which languagepermits.32 The incessant creative activity of the absolute does not involveit in any temporal diversification. The emergence and submergence ofeach total-event from the body of consciousness does not divide it in anyway. Even so, we experience change. Abhinava says:As there is no succession within [consciousness], there is nosimultaneity; and as there is no simultaneity, there is no successioneither. The extremely pure conscious reality transcends all talk ofsuccession and its absence.33In reality nothing arises and nothing falls away. It is the vibratingpower of consciousness which, though free of change, becomes manifest inthis or that form and thus appears to be arising and falling away:34[All things] exist in Siva just as blue rays reside in the opal; in realitythey nowhere come into being nor cease to exist.35Reality presents itself to reason as a paradox: though it is one, yet it isdiverse; though changing, it changes not at all. All the concepts we may"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONhave of it necessarily fall short of the truth. To know reality we mustexperience it directly. \"Why speak much?\" ask the Stanzas on Vibration,\"[the yogi] will experience it for himself! \"36 When the yogi is plunged inthe contemplative absorption of the 'Fourth State' (turiya) beyondwaking, dreaming and deep sleep, he shares in Siva's experience, enjoyingits vibrant creative power personified as the Goddess, Siva's consort:This Goddess of Consciousness, the Fourth State (turiya) consists ofthe union of emission, preservation and destruction.

Theemergence of the universe from consciousness and its submergence backinto it are not simply a matter of withdrawing or replacing an object froma locus in space. The world does not come out of the absolute as dowalnuts out of a bag.38 The change from the pre-cosmic to the cosmic stateis a transformation from one form of consciousness to another. Thetransition from one form of consciousness to another marks the creationof a new experience and the destruction of the old. Thus the power ofawareness potentially contains within itself every possible experience—every cycle of creation and destruction. It is the inner blissful vibration(antahspanda) which impels the movement (yibhramd) of the universemade manifest as the outer cosmic rhythm (bahihspanda) of creationand destruction.39 Ksemaraja writes:The vibrating power of awareness (spandasakti) is the bliss which isthe wonder of the one compact mass of T consciousness embracing theendless cycles of creation and destruction. Its true nature is themanifestation of the expansion and contraction of the perceiver and theperceived which represent the entire pure and impure creation.40Universal creation is like the individual creation of the world ofwaking life when a person wakes from sleep. Conversely, just as when aperson sleeps all the activities and ideas of waking life cease and mergeback into his self-consciousness, so during cosmic destruction, in the sleep(nimesa) of consciousness, everything is withdrawn and brought to restwithin it.

Thus the entire universe of being and non-being is onewith You.42The Stanzas on Vibration explain that the universe comes into beingwhen Siva, as it were, opens His eyes to see it, and is again destroyed whenHe closes His eyes to observe His own nature and no longer views theuniverse.43 Siva's power to know the universe is one with His power tocreate it:Then, when the Lord desires to discern something within the abodeof the Void, the universe spontaneously unfolds and is established withinconsciousness and the Lord's unfolding power of knowledgeperceives it.44In this way, consciousness expands to assume the form of the universeby withdrawing back into itself. In other words, by veiling His undividednature, Siva appears as the diverse play of multiplicity. Conversely, whenSiva reveals His own nature and withdraws the veil which contractsconsciousness, the universe is destroyed:45The Supreme Lord is the light of the absolute (anuttara).Concealing His own nature, by the glory of His free will alone, He restson the plane of objectively definable knowledge (pramdna), etc., andmakes phenomena manifest [as if] separate [from His own nature].46The universe is the wonderful variety (vicitrata) of Siva's naturecreated by Him when he reflects on Himself and thinks 4I am diverse'.47Siva contemplates none other than Himself, whether He knows Himself asthe multiplicity of things or as their undivided source. At one with Siva,the enlightened yogi recognises that the expansion {unmesa) of theuniverse of diversity coincides with the expansion of his own undividedconsciousness which appears as \"the dawning of absolute reality to theexclusion of the external world.\"48 Thus the two phases in the pulse ofconsciousness coincide. Oscillating like the pans of an evenly weightedbalance,49 they are perfectly equivalent. Ksemaraja writes:The state of cosmic contraction (nimesa) is identical with the stateof expansion (unmesa) even though the [universe reverts to a pure"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"86  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconsciousness] which assimilates everything within itself to form anundivided unity.50Again:The contracted state (nimesa), corresponding to the withdrawal ofpreviously emitted diversity, is itself the expanding (unmesa) awarenessof the unity of consciousness. [Conversely] the expanded state (unmesa),indicative of forthcoming diversity, is itself the contraction (nimesa) ofthe awareness of the unity of consciousness.51Thus, the expansion and contraction of consciousness are broughtabout by Siva's pulsating power, which is simultaneously identical withboth. They are the internal and external aspects of the same energy.Similarly, cosmogenesis and lysis do not essentially differ:Cosmic lysis {pralaya) corresponds to the state of [Siva's] power inwhich external [objectivity] is predominantly withdrawn (nimesa). It isthe unfolding (unmesa) of the innate nature which corresponds to theemergence of a state of unity (abheda) and the withdrawal of diversemultiplicity (bheda). Therefore we maintain that lysis (pralaya) is thesame as the genesis (udaya of consciousness) and that genesis is also thesame as lysis.52There are many passages in the Upanisads which explicitly state thatthe universe emerges from Brahman and that it is ultimately reabsorbedback into It.53 Even so, Sankara's Vedanta cannot accept that creation isa real process. Following the lead of his predecessor, Gautfapada, Sankaramaintains that no universe is ever actually created. The real is unborn anduncreated;54 hence creation can only occur within the domain of illusion(maya). From the Advaita Vedantin's point of view, to state that theuniverse arises from, and subsides into, the absolute Brahman is anotherway of saying that the universe is transitory and hence illusory. Illusionsalso appear and disappear; only their real ground continues to existunchanged:\"As the spaces within pots or jars,\" writes Sankara, \"are non-different from cosmic space, or as water in a mirage is non-different froma [sandy] desert—since they sometimes appear and sometimes vanishaway, and as such their nature cannot be defined, even so is it to beunderstood that this phenomenal world of experiences, thingsexperienced and so on, has no existence apart from Brahman.\"55"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 87Kashmiri Saivism maintains that all things are spontaneouslyemanated by consciousness in such a way that the original source of theemitted product remains unchanged and one with its emanation. Theplenitude of universal manifestation emerges out of the fullness of theabsolute; both are perfect expressions of the all-encompassing totality ofreality which, thus emitting itself, suffers no loss.56 The manifestation ofthe universe is, in this sense, a real event, not just an apparent change(vivarta) in the essentially undivided nature of the absolute. Even so, asthe absolute undergoes no change when becoming manifest as theuniverse, diversity is, in a sense, merely an apparent deviation from unity.Again, in one sense, cosmogenesis involves a real transformation(parinama) of consciousness into the form of a universe, much as a ball ofclay changes when fashioned into a jar. Yet, in another sense, conscious-ness undergoes no transformation at all. Bhagavatotpala quotes the Lightof Consciousness (Samvitprakasa) in his commentary on the Stanzas onVibration to illustrate this seeming paradox:In no circumstance is the All-Pervasive Lord subject in this way tochange, either apparent or real. Even if He were subject to both Hisnature would remain undivided.57The Kashmiri Saivite agrees with the Vedantin that everythingappears just as it is without any real change occurring in the essentialnature of the absolute. Even so, he maintains that the production ofdiversity is not merely an apparent change in the unity of the absolute ifthis implies the production of unreal entities, for they could never be mademanifest.58 Thus, the Kashmiri Saivite accepts the view that an effect is areal transformation (parinama) of its cause, although he does so withcertain reservations. Even when the light of consciousness is apparent tous as the universe of our experience, there is no question of its becominganything else. The effect is the cause appearing as the effect withoutchanging in any way. Abhinava writes:[A real transformation of cause into effect] entails the obscuring ofthe preceding form [of the changing substance] and the coming into beingof another. In the case of the light of consciousness this is impossiblebecause it has no other form. [Moreover], if [the light of consciousness]were to be obscured [the entire universe] would be as if blind. Again, [ifthe new form] were other than the light of consciousness it could notappear. In either case the universe [could not be perceived and hence]would be as if asleep, [which runs contrary to our] experience.59"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONA change can involve two types of transformation (parinama). Thefirst type is total. The material cause becomes its effect (karyaparinama)in such a way that it is completely and irreversibly absorbed into it. Theexample given is that of a log burnt to ashes. This type of change theKashmiri Saiva rejects, and so denies that the substance of a materialcause undergoes any real change to produce its effect. However, he doesaccept the possibility of a real change occurring in its qualities (dharma-paririama). This second type of change does not entail the total destructionof the cause and allows for the possibility of a reversion of the effect backinto it. All that has happened is that the qualities of the material cause—itsform, texture, physical properties, etc., have temporarily changed.60This concept of causality fits with the manner in which the KashmiriSaivite describes the process of manifestation. Consciousnessspontaneously evolves through a series of stages ranging from the mostsubjective or 'inner' states of Siva-consciousness to the most 'outer' orobjective forms of awareness. The process of descent into matter is aprogressive self-limitation (rodhand) of consciousness. As we have seen,the different orders or levels in the hierarchy (taratamya) of being do not,in reality, become manifest consecutively. Even so, the only way we canunderstand the process of manifestation is to conceive the differentcategories of existence (tattva) as progressively emerging fromconsciousness in a single causal chain. Each member of this chain is theeffect of all the preceding members and a constituent cause of the lower,grosser orders which follow it.61 Ksemaraja explains:When [the Lord] feels a playful desire to veil His own nature andappears in the order of descent, the preceding [members in the sequence]... fall into the background and the succeeding forms come to the fore, insuch a way that the preceding members serve as the substratum for thesucceeding [phases].62In this way the cause contains within itself the effect in a potentialform while the effect contains the cause as its actualization. Abhinavaexplains:Thus, even though the final element [in the series] is such as it is, itnonetheless contains within itself all the other countless aspects that, stepby step, precede it and are encompassed by it in such a way that they areinseparable from its own nature. [Consciousness] thus illumines andcontemplates itself as full and perfect {piirna). The members whichprecede [any given phase] likewise have their being in the same reflectiveawareness and light of consciousness which, full and perfect, has already"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 89unfolded through the succeeding members. Thus, [none of the phases]are divorced from the fullness [of consciousness] and they embrace all theother members which precede them and forcibly induce them to form apart of their own nature. Each of these phases illumining itself thus, andreflecting on its own nature, is full and perfect.63The two phases of the pulsation of consciousness from inner to outerand outer to inner are equivalent, respectively, to the processes of self-limitation or coagulation (rodhana) of consciousness and the dissolution(drdvana) of the gross into the subtler forms of consciousness. Theyrepresent the sequence of descent into matter and ascent into conscious-ness.64 As consciousness descends, its manifestations become increasinglysubject to the power of natural law (niyati) and so progressively moreconditioned. Conversely, as it ascends it frees itself, step by step, ofconstraints until it reaches its fullest manifestation as the absolute beyondall relativity.65 Therefore, from one point of view, we can think of theprocess of descent as a movement into the fettered condition and theprocess of ascent as the movement towards liberation. This is how itappears to those who have not realised the true nature of the pulse ofconsciousness—Spanda—in its two phases. For the enlightened, however,these movements represent the spontaneous activity of consciousness.Creation is the manifestation of difference within the unity of conscious-ness through which it immanentalises into its cosmic form. Destruction isthe reverse of this. Diversity merges into unity and consciousness assumesits transcendental formless aspect. These two aspects represent,respectively, the 'lower' (apara) and 'supreme' (para) forms of Siva.Three Moments in the Vibration of ConsciousnessThe transformation from one aspect to the other can be analysed interms of a number of successive phases. This, as we have seen, is no morethan a convenient way of conceiving the activity of consciousness. Evenso, it serves not only to explain in conceptual terms what happens, but italso serves as a means to realise the liberating experience of Spanda. Oneway this movement can be understood is to analyse it into three stagescorresponding to three aspects of the universal power of Siva'sconsciousness, namely, will, knowledge and action. All things come intobeing through an act of will, with action as its immediate instrumentalcause and knowledge of its application as the intermediary between thewill to create and the act itself.66 Insofar as the emergence of an object"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"90  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONwithin the field of awareness through the act of perception, and itssubsequent subsidence when it has been perceived, are part of the radiantpulse (sphuraria) of awareness,67 this three-fold vibration constitutes theessential nature of all things as elements of experience.68 The intent onmaking the object manifest, the actual act of manifestation and themanifest state, which are the result of these three powers in their due order,represent the beginning, middle and end of all things, held together asaspects of the universal flow of the absolute (anuttara).69 Siva's 'lower'(apara) form is the unfolding (unme$a) of the flow (prasara) of thisuniversal will70 in which His powers of will, knowledge and action manifestin relation to their respective fields of operation.71 In Siva's supreme(para) form His powers merge into one energy that comes to rest withinSiva where it naturally resides.72 As Bhaskaracarya explains:[Sakti's] own abode is understood to be the place of Being (sat)called Siva. It is [Siva's] vitality (virya), [His] energy of the nature ofknowledge and action. [Energy's] stable state is absorption (llnata), thatis, penetration into the agential aspect [of consciousness]. That same[state] is the light of intuition (pratibha) which is the solitary churner ofthe light of consciousness [that thus aroused issues forth as theuniverse].73In His supreme, transcendental state, Siva's knowledge is theawareness He has of Himself as full of all things (purno'ham). It is one withHis activity as the inner vibration of His all-embracing 'I-ness', the creativemovement of the will. Thus, together, these three powers represent aspectsof Siva's bliss,74 which is His Spanda nature as the enjoying subjectivity(bhoktrtva). They are the Lordship (lsvarata\\ agency of knowledge(jnatftva) and agency of action (kartrtva) of universal consciousness.75The vibration of consciousness is the power of one's own true nature(svabala) which brings about the incessant coming together and separationof these energies in the supreme state of universal consciousness and on thelower level of individual consciousness.76 So let us now examine thesethree powers in greater detail.The Conative Power of ConsciousnessThe self-revealing (svatahsiddha) character of Being corresponds tothe incessant flow of consciousness through its will to Be. The outpouringof the will to exist expresses itself both as the active cause of individual"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 91beings and the passive assent (abhyupagama) to Being expressed throughthe individuality (svabhdva) of all that partakes of Being. The will is thusboth the agent and the act of Being:Thus the will of the Lord Who wills to appear as the jars or cloths,etc., constituting the world as the manifestations (abhasa) of conscious-ness, is the cause, the agent and the action.77The will is coextensive with its own conscious intent. As such it is aform of awareness (vimarsa) associated with a specific goal which it reflectson as its objective. The generic nature (samanyarupd) of awareness is thusrestricted and directed to a single object.78 The potter's intention to makea pot relates to the action he is about to perform. If his intent were notlimited to its own specific object, the potter could just as well set aboutweaving a cloth or do anything else.79 When we walk down the road, weare conscious of our ultimate destination and move towards it; eventhough we may pause to admire the scenery, the will remains fixed (niyata)on its goal.80 Similarly, cooking involves a number of separate actions;even so, the awareness that 'I cook' remains one and unbroken. Theconscious intent remains constant throughout. Although it may manifestat different times through different actions, the same will necessarilyprecedes every action and perception. The existence of another will, priorto, and instigating the will to act or perceive entails that this second willrequire another to initiate it and that another, leading to an infinite regress.Nor can we deny the existence of the will. Without an original desire to act,activity would be aimless: nothing would determine that one action shouldoccur rather than another. Similarly, no intrinsic necessity ordains thatthe perception of a particular object should follow that of another. Thereason why all other possible perceptions are excluded from the field ofawareness is that the will freely chooses to direct attention towards theintended object of perception.Preceding both perception and action, the will is most clearly manifest(sphufa) when it begins to assert itself in the subject before eitherperception or action take place. The first moment or intent (aunmukhya)of the will towards its objective conditions the inherent contentment ofconsciousness at rest in itself, by the act upon which it is intent.81 Even so,it coincides with the final moment in the movement of the will when theprevious desire to act is satisfied and consciousness abides in a state of pureintent free of all specific goals and full of the power of bliss.82 Abhinavaexplains:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"92  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATION[The universal will] in the form of desire (kdmand) blossoms forththrough the individual subject. Thus actualized, it is apparent as a desirefor sense objects. It does not proceed through the succeeding phases[mechanically] step by step like the feet of the blind. Rather, after it hasbeen aroused and has initially decided upon its goal, thus stimulated, itbounds forward with delight to forcibly lay hold of its goal like a far-sighted man when walking. The will is clearly evident in the initial statewhen it has [just] arisen and is similarly full and perfect (purna) in itsfinal state of rest.83Thus, we can distinguish between two moments in the movement ofthe will. The first is the initial state of tension or intent (aunmukhya) andthe second when it goes on to develop into a conscious desire for a specificobject (isyamdna), discursively representable (savikalpa) at the individuallevel of awareness. At this stage the object of desire appears to be projectedoutside the subject who desires it, although at the universal level theiressential unity remains unchanged. In reality, it is the subject who isalways the object of his own desire.84 But insofar as the subject is nowcaught up in the object he desires, the first moment is, from the point ofview of practice, more important. So for the rest of this section we shalldevote our attention to it.Prior to their manifestation, all things reside within consciousness ina potential form just as in a peacock's egg, we find all the peacock's limbswith its feathers large and small, colours and patterns.85 In the state ofinvolution {nimesa) all things mingle with one another in the all-embracingegoity (piirnahanta) of Siva's nature.86 When consciousness evolves(unmesa) out of itself to become the diversified universe of experience, thispre-existent potential is actualized. In this way differentiated awarenesspours out of the body of undifferentiated consciousness, heralded by asubtle stress or vibration (ghumana) of aesthetic delight set up in its causalmatrix.87 This is Spanda in its purest form, free of all differentiation.Bhagavatotpala defines it accordingly: \"[This] pulsation (spanda) isconsciousness free of mental constructs. It is the state in which theSupreme Soul actively tends towards [manifestation]. It simultaneouslyoperates everywhere [although the Supreme Soul is in Himself]motionless (nistarahgay\\uAt this stage all the powers of the absolute are activated and mergedin the unity of the bliss (ananda) Siva experiences contemplating His ownnature. Subject, object and means of knowledge form a single undividedwhole, like the clay ball (pinda) a potter is about to fashion into a jar.89 Itis the matrix of all cosmic vibrations, both of the physical order and theextra-physical or metaphysical. In this state consciousness is like a seed"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 93swelling to bursting point (ucchuna), abounding with infinite possibili-ties.90 Somananda explains:When a waveless stretch of water becomes violently agitated, onemay notice, if one observes carefully, an initial tension [which formswithin it] just when this begins to happen. When the open fingers of thehand are clenched into a fist, one may notice at the outset of this action,a [slight] movement. Similarly, when the desire to create begins to unfoldin consciousness, at rest tranquil in itself, a tension [arises within it].91This initial instant (tuti) is as fleeting and full of energy as a lightningflash.92 Preceding the spatial-temporal continuum of the lower (apara) orimmanent level of consciousness, it is not a moment fully set in time. Thesubtle influence the power of time exerts on the, as yet, unclearlydifferentiated objectivity (idanta) made manifest at this level93 serves as alink between the eternal and the temporal, the unmanifest consciousnessand the manifest universe. He who pays close attention to the initialwelling up of desire when it is especially intense is afforded an opportunityto realise the fullness of consciousness by merging into the force of hisintention. As Utpaladeva puts it:Here [during the initial movement of the will], worldly men whodesire to ascend to the plane of ultimate reality can experience in this waythe entire aggregate of energies.94In states of heightened psychic intensity all the powers operatingthrough the mind and senses are suddenly withdrawn into the pulsing coreof one's own nature, just as a tortoise contracts its limbs in fright,95 and thecontinuity of mental life is suddenly broken. The ordinary man, hopelesslydistracted, is carried away by this flood of energy (saktivisargd). The yogi,however, master of himself, can by the sheer intensity of this energypenetrate through the flux of his feelings to the 'firmly fixed vibration'(pratisfhaspanda) of his own nature. He must learn to do this the instantfear arises in him or when he begins to feel depressed or disgusted, no lessthan when he is confused and wondering what to do. Equally he must tryto penetrate into the source of the vitality (virya) which intensifies theactivity of the senses during the ecstasy of love or of joy at beholding abeautiful object or seeing a close relative after a long time.96 Overcomewith the awe (vismaya) of self-realisation (atmalabhd), the yogi intuits theintense feelings welling up inside him as aspects of the aesthetic rapture ofconsciousness (ciccamatkara)91 in which all emotions blend together like"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONrivers in the ocean of his blissful consciousness. The Stanzas onVibration teach:Spanda is stable in that state one enters when extremely angry,extremely excited, running or wondering what to do.98The alert yogi (prabuddha) reflects upon his own nature and in sodoing instantly penetrates into the initial tension of the will during theseheightened states of emotivity. The instant they arise he is elevated beyondhis conditioned state of consciousness and so is never entangled in them.The unawakened, however, overcome by Maya, falls a victim to thesestates believing mistakenly that his many perceptions and actions areindependent of the universal pulsation of his own authentic nature. Thusin order to achieve the direct intuitive insight (upalabdhi) that they aregrounded in the universal movement of consciousness (sdmdnyaspanda),one must desist from the tendency, engendered by one's lack of self-awareness, to make distinctions between the functions (vftti) ofconsciousness to will, exert itself, know and act, etc.\". In this way, the yogidiscovers that they are all aspects of the one undivided pulse ofconsciousness.This awareness can be achieved by attending to the first movement ofthe will, discovered when we are fully present to ourselves in the actualityof our situation. Every instant is a new beginning which abides in theeternity of the self-perpetuating present where all 'beginnings' cease.100The closer we come to experiencing the moment in which the impulse toaction arises, the more directly we come in contact with the concreteactuality of the present and the authenticity of our Being. Thus the Spandateachings instruct the yogi to maintain an alert awareness of the continuityof his consciousness throughout his every action. When running in fear,for example, he should attend closely to the desire he feels to lift his foot;then to the exertion he applies to lift it and the attention he directs to theplace where he is going to place it, as well as the actual act of doing so. Hemust similarly attend to each phase in the production of words andsentences {sabdanispatti) uttered in the excitement of a vivaciousconversation, or the movement of the fingers while playing a musicalinstrument.101The same holds true of the impulse to perceive. The yogi must fix hisattention on the thought-free (nirvikalpa) intent of the unfolding (unmesa)of awareness which marks the initial impulse to perception (didrksd). Foran instant the individual subject (ksetrajna) experiences the same identitybetween the entities he desires to perceive and his own consciousness, as"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 95does the supreme subject between Himself and every entity in theuniverse.102 He shares in the Great Pervasion (mahavyapti) of universalconsciousness present in all the categories of existence (tattva).Abhinava explains:Immersing himself in the supreme reality, clearly aware thatconsciousness is all things, [the yogi's consciousness] vibrates. Thisvibration (ghurrii) is the Great Pervasion (mahavyapti).mAlways on the alert to discern the activity of his own vibratingconsciousness, the yogi's attitude (mudra) is kept secret (rahasya) in theprivacy of his own experience. Established in his own nature, the yogi'sawareness is intent (unmukha) on discerning the All (sarvabhava) as histrue nature through the on-going expansion (vikasavftti) of his ownconsciousness the instant his senses are set in motion:The yogi should abide firmly fixed in his own nature by the power ofthe exertion of [his] expanding consciousness (yikasavrtti). [Thus he is]established on the plane of Bliss relishing the objects of sense thatspontaneously appear before him. Perfected yogis (siddha\\ devoted tobliss, are ever steadfast in this, the Supreme Gesture (mudra), the perfectand unobstructed expansion of the Awakened.104Intent in this way on the initial movement of the will, the power of theyogi's awareness free of thought-constructs (nirvikalpa) transcends thelimitations imposed upon it by the diversity of perceptions and he isawakened to the higher reality of his all-embracing (purna) nature.Penetrating into the universal vibration (samanyaspanda) of conscious-ness, he shares in its unfolding vision (unmesa)105 and comes to recogniseevery state, whether in the mental or in the physical sphere, to be Siva.106Every phase in the unfolding and withdrawal of the activity of the will isnow illumined by the yogi's reflective awareness. Perceiving the totality ofhis experience through the undivided vision of universal consciousness, heexperiences the subject, object and means of knowledge as a single wholereposing in the supreme subject with which he is now identified. Havingburnt away the sense of diversity (vibhdgabodha) in the fire of awarenessand transmuted it into the unity of his true nature, the yogi is established inthe supreme flow (paradhara) of the powers of consciousness.107 Hemaintains a state of self-awareness throughout every moment of hisexperience, be it while waking, dreaming or in deep sleep.108 Space, time,change and form are recognised to be modalities of the one consciousness"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"96  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONand no longer condition it. The awakened yogi is now constantly mindfulof the pulsing power of his true nature not only in the beginning but inevery phase of his activity and perception. He realises that all things existby virtue of their identity with the supreme subject which he recogniseshimself to be and so no longer wanders in samsara.mThe Cognitive Power of ConsciousnessThe apparent gap between the unmanifest, perceiving consciousnessand the manifest, perceived object is bridged by understanding theirdistinctive status as two modes of perception. The cognitive power ofconsciousness operates both as the immediate, intuitive awarenessconsciousness has of its own nature and as the mediated perception ofobjectively manifest particulars. The will to create represents the firstmovement (adyaspandd) out of the absolute, unmanifest condition intothe relative, phenomenally manifest state. The first movement (ddya-spanda) of awareness that occurs within the sphere of manifestation isthe perception of the undifferentiated totality projected into it by theuniversal will. The activity of the power of knowledge coincides with theexpansion (unmesa) of objectivity in the field of awareness. In theprimordial emptiness of consciousness the faint traces of cosmicmanifestation appear as 4the inner desire to know the universe [conscious-ness] wills to create'.110 This unfolding awareness successively evolvesthrough the various states of consciousness ranging from deep sleep tothe waking state,l ] l where the totality of occurrences making up the worldof experience is set apart from the individual locus of awareness. Theperceptions occasioned by the operation of the cognitive power ofconsciousness are now fully formed and the universe of experience ismanifest in all its plenitude:This is the expansion of the power of knowledge which unfolds[spontaneously] through its own energy {tejas)\\ phenomena become fullymanifest through the persistence of cognition {jnanasthiti).ulThe vibrating power {spandasakti) of knowledge is thus the purecognitive awareness (upalabdhrta) of consciousness,113 which both linksperceptions together and accounts for their individual emergence withinthe field of awareness. These two functions correspond to the quiescentand emergent aspects of consciousness, which together account for thepossibility of phenomenal experience. The quiescent aspect represents"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Spanda: Universal Activity of Absolute Consciousness 97absolute, undivided consciousness and the emergent, its finite manifesta-tions. Perceptions could not take place were consciousness to beconstantly at rest within itself. Completely immersed in its ownindeterminate nature, nothing could be made manifest at all. On the otherhand, if consciousness were to be entirely emergent as the manifestuniverse, it could never be consciously experienced. The apparentontological distinction between the absolute and the relative, the infiniteand the finite, is thus reducible to an epistemic distinction between twodifferent modes of knowledge. The cognitive power of consciousness isits capacity to shift back and forth between these two modes and, as itdoes so, select some of the countless potential forms merged within it tomake them externally manifest.114 The light of consciousness, full tooverflowing with innumerable phenomena, thus separates some of themfrom itself, while at the same time limiting its own nature to apear as theindividual (mdylya) subject set apart from the object. Perception takesplace when this limited subject is affected by the 'shade' (chdyd) cast upon itby the object. As the pulse of awareness moves from the expanded,undivided state to the contracted, limited condition and back again ateach instant, novel perceptions are generated and the world of experienceis thus constantly renewed. Thus this energy, like those of will and action,is essentially Siva's creative power (svatantrya) which is the vibration{spanda) of consciousness through which He generates all things.115The Power of ActionSiva's conative energy becomes fully evident in all its plenitude whenthe activity of consciousness is manifest (prasrta) on the phenomenalplane.'16 The creative will is the freedom of the absolute and so is equatedboth with its power to act (kriydsakti) and its power to fashion the diverseforms of the universe (nirmdnasakti). It is the action of the creativesubjectivity (nirmdtrta) of consciousness.117 As 'the agency of the act ofBeing' the power of action is the essence (sdra) of universal Being(sattamatra)u% of all things119 both as their pragmatic efficacy andmanifest nature.120This autonomous act of Being is free in every way. It is an act ofawareness, the agent of which is the Light of the Heart of consciousness.Being can only be directly experienced within the domain of the subject.We cannot grasp the pure Act of universal Being in the sphere ofobjectivity. The object is a product of the act of Being of which thesubject is the agent. Only the agent is completely autonomous and"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONself-existent. As such he is one and absolute and so can be none other thanSiva Himself, Whose agency is free in all respects.121 The potter is an agentand is free to make his pot because he shares in Siva's nature as the agent.122It is Siva Himself Who fashions the jar through the potter and weaves acloth through the weaver, just as at the universal level He is the guide andimpeller (pravartaka) of the flux of cosmic forces and of the powers ofconsciousness:Listen! Our Lord, Whose nature is consciousness, is unlimited, theabsolute master of the arising and dissolving away of every power.123Siva, the universal agent, eternally active is never bound by Hisactivity. The universe is the unfolding effect of Siva's agency (kartfpratha)while He, as the agent, always remains true to His essential, autonomousnature.124 The law of action and reaction {karma) binds only theignorant.125 At the lower level, outer activity contrasts with innerawareness. The unfolding of the power of action coincides with thewithdrawal of self-awareness. At the higher level, the universal outpouringof consciousness is experienced as the inner Being of all things whichspontaneously rise out of it without obscuring it in any way:Thus action is said to be one and born of no other inner nature [butitself, which, as such] emerges out of the innate nature [of all things]. Itis [the goddess] Siva, the inner nature, which spontaneously emergesout of itself.126The Doctrine of Vibration urges us to be conscious of Spanda, therecurrent activity of consciousness. In all its outer phases, be they will,knowledge or action, we can catch a glimpse of our authentic identity andrealise our inherent freedom. The inner activity of consciousness, free ofall restrictions, is bliss itself. The experience of Spanda is wonder, anabiding bliss far higher than the transitory pleasures of life. We canexperience Spanda through the activity of the senses, mind and body,because its foundation is universal consciousness, our authentic Sivanature.

Encompassed by the vision of Siva's all-embracingconsciousness, all contrasts and contradictions are resolved in theharmony of opposites.1 This unity is the Wholeness of the All in whichthe opposites are transfigured into a divine polarity, each member ofwhich fully represents the absolute through its inherent identity with itsopposite counterpart.In the Hindu tradition this primal opposition and its reconciliationin the unity of opposites is understood as the intimate, inner relationshipbetween God and His omnipotent power. God is the formless andtranscendent unity Who as, and through, His power manifests diversity.God and His creation are not two contrasting realities. Intimately boundtogether as heat is with fire2 or coolness with ice,3 Sakti—God's power,and Siva—its possessor, are never separate.4 Even so, if we are tounderstand their relationship we must provisionally distinguish betweenthem in the realms of manifestation. First, we have the finite vision inwhich they are seen apart and then the infinite vision in which we realisetheir unity. Without the experience of duality that of unity would have nomeaning.

Spanda is the immanent, actively emergent aspect,while Sankara, although 'one with the Spanda principle and neverotherwise',5 is the pure, unchanging experiencer Who represents theelement of continuity—the passive, quiescent aspect of consciousness. Inthe Trikakula school the latter is called Bhairava and the former Hisemission (yisarga):\"Bhairava and His power of emission,\" explains Abhinava,\"constitute the couple (yamala). One member (Bhairava) rests in Hisown eternal, unchanging nature, and is therefore called 'repose'(visrama). The other is His primordial vibration {prathamaspanda)and is therefore called 'emergence' (udaya).\"6The opposites separate and merge in rhythm with the pulsing unionof Siva and Sakti. This play of opposites is itself the absolute, the supremeform of Spanda.7 When Siva and Sakti unite, the universe, formerlyexperienced as a reality set apart from consciousness, ceases to exist.When they separate, it is once more created. The eternal rhythm of cosmiccreation and destruction is consonant with the pulse of their union andseparation. Spanda is the blissful relationship between these two aspectsthrough which the universe unfolds.8 The emission of cosmic manifesta-tion (yisarga) pours out between these two poles. It is the result of theirconjunction, just as through the bliss of orgasm (visarga) the male andfemale seeds mingle, and man—the microcosm—is born. The yogi whowitnesses this union experiences the birth of a higher level of consciousnesswithin himself. He recognises the all-powerful pulsation of his conscious-ness as it moves between Sankara's transcendental bliss9 and the radiantemission of His immanent power within Himself. One fixed and the othermoving, these two poles are like firesticks that, rubbing together, generatewithin Sankara His pure Spanda energy.10 In the bliss of self-realisation,the yogi experiences this as the simultaneous unfolding of cosmicconsciousness and the pure undifferentiated consciousness of the absolute.He experiences them together as the universal vibration of the supremesubject beyond all contradictions and distinctions. Abhinava instructs:Just as a female ass or mare [in orgasm], enters into the [delight ofher own] Abode, the Temple of Bliss repeatedly expanding andcontracting and is overjoyed in her own heart, so [the yogi] must establishhimself in the Bhairava couple, expanding and contracting, full of all"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Siva and Sakti  101things, dissolved and created by them again and again.''Jayaratha explains that the contraction of Sakti marks thewithdrawal of the universe and the expansion of transcendental Siva-consciousness. Conversely, the contraction of Siva-consciousness marksthe expansion of Sakti as the cosmos.12 The yogi attains the supreme stateof consciousness by experiencing the pulsing rhythm of this divine couple(yamalabhava) through which he realises that the absolute is at once bothSiva and Sakti and yet neither of the two:The couple {yamala) is consciousness itself, the unifying emissionand the stable abode. It is the absolute, the noble cosmic bliss consistingof both [Siva and Sakti]. It is the supreme secret of Kula [the ultimatereality]; neither quiescent nor emergent, it is the flowing fount of bothquiescence and emergence.13Both Sarikara and His Spanda energy have two aspects. Sankara isSpandasakti, the active aspect, as well as being Sankara, the passiveaspect. Equally, Spanda is Sankara, the passive aspect, as well as beingSpanda, the active aspect:\"These two aspects, passive (sdnta) and active {udita)\" explainsAbhinava, \"arise at the same time in the power and its possessor. Theactive passes from one domain to the other, the passive is confined withinthe Self [the essential nature of both]. But even so, in reality, each ofthem form a couple {yamala). Hence the emergent is the quiescent.\"14Despite the one aspect being the other, Spandasakti is still the activeaspect and the cause of creation:Even though the awareness proper to these two aspects, passive andactive, pertains to them equally, nonetheless it is power, not its possessor,that nurtures His emission (visarga).15Mahesvarananda explains the manner in which we can perceive Sivaand Sakti as a gestalt. It is like a picture of a bull and an elephant drawntogether in such a way that we see either one or the other depending on theway in which we view it.16 There is a movement (spanda) of awarenessfrom one to the other as Siva becomes Sakti and Sakti becomes Siva. Theyare reflected within one another like two mirrors facing each other.Exchanging roles repeatedly, they penetrate each other in the intimacy of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"102  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONtheir union.17 In this way consciousness contemplates itself as both Sivaand Sakti simultaneously. In other words, the moment in which it is awareof itself as transcending all things, it is also aware of its immanence. Thesetwo moments of transcendence and immanence imply one another whileremaining distinct.18The Play of Passion and its Power (Kamakaldvilasa), a text of theSakta Srlvidya tradition explains the dynamics of this process in somedetail. Siva and Sakti are represented in this work as the universal subjectand His cosmic object. Their infinite nature is symbolized by two trans-dimensional points of absolute consciousness (bindu). Siva is representedby a white point (suklabindu) and Sakti by a red point (sonitabindu): bothexpand and contract. 'White Siva' penetrates 'Red Sakti'. This results inthe creation of the universe and Siva's transformation into Sakti andSakti's transformation into Siva. Siva becomes 'Red Siva' and acts as thesupreme reality and transcendental ground of 'White Sakti'—the manifestuniverse. Then 'Red Siva' penetrates into 'White Sakti' and 'White Siva'withdraws from 'Red Sakti'. This phase of their pulsation marks themoment of transcendence and the withdrawal of the universe. 'WhiteSakti' is retransformed into 'White Siva' and 'Red Siva' into 'Red Sakti'.Sakti then merges in Siva as the introverted awareness He has of Himselfas pure transcendental T consciousness. They thus exchange roles. Whenone comes to the fore and becomes manifestly apparent, the other recedesinto the background as the unmanifest, inner nature of the other. The twomoments of transcendence and immanence, Siva and Sakti, thus implyone another.19The two points make up the two aspects of Visarga—the last memberof the vowel series, written in Sanskrit as ':' and pronounced 'h\\ This isthe form (svarupa) of KameSvari—the Mistress of Passion Who is thepower of reflective awareness (yimarsasakti) through which the absoluteunfolds and withdraws its cosmic form.

When Siva and Sakti, the two aspects of thepure vibration of consciousness, are understood as one reality, theirsymbol is a single dot (pronounced 'm') called a 'mixed point' (misra-bindu). It represents both the integral unity of the absolute and the fertilepotential of consciousness which, like a seed, is swollen (ucchuna) ready togerminate into cosmic manifestation.20 This 'mixed point' is the seed ofconsciousness known as the 'Sun of Knowledge'. It is Kamesvara—theLord of Passion.21 He is the Self worshipped by yogis as the highest realityand the form or body (pintfa) of the absolute symbolized as the sexualembrace of Siva and Sakti,22 the Divine Husband and Wife.

Thus, although all schools ofKashmiri Saivism are essentially Saivite, some tend to emphasise theimportance of one or the other. The Spanda school, however, maintainsthat power and the power-holder are equally important. Sankara is thesource of power28 and so is, in this respect, superior to the Goddess Who isits embodiment. On the other hand, this power is the means by which wecan discover our authentic identity to be Siva—the power-holder. Theflow of the supreme power is Sankara's path.29 Herein lies Spanda'simportance; while Safikara is the goal (upeya), Spanda is the means(upaya).^ We must recognise the activity of Spandasakti in every momentof our lives. By knowing the divine energy which creates and animates theworld, we know ourselves to be its possessor. Only through Spanda'spower can we realise our identity with Siva. But it alone is not enough;power without a power-holder to regulate its activity is blind andpotentially destructive.SafikaraThe Spanda yogi experiences the absolute in intimately personalterms as an infinite and perfect divine Being.

Of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"104  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONall these names for Siva, 'Sankara' is the one preferred by the teachers ofthe Spanda tradition. Intent solely on gracing man in every way, Sankarais so-called because He bestows the best of things (sam).34 Like theWishfulfilling Gem, He gives man all he desires.35 As Abhinava says:Once one has achieved the Supreme Lord's state (paramesvarata) allthe good things that came from it are automatically attained just as all thejewels [in the world] are acquired by acquiring Rohana, the Mountain ofGems. Other achievements are vain if one has missed the supreme reality,the Self. But once one has attained this reality {paramartha), there isnothing left one could desire.36Through Sankara's grace man overcomes all the limitations thatcontract his consciousness and he comes to recognise that it fills the entireuniverse. Encompassing all things in itself it is blissfully at rest.Ksemaraja says:We praise Sankara Who is one's own nature. He bestows the graceto recognise the total expansion of one's own consciousness which is thenon-duality of Supreme Bliss wherein all troubles cease.37Sankara bestows both the peace of liberation from suffering(apavarga), and the delight (bhoga) of recognising all things to be nothingbut Sankara Himself.38 Man achieves liberation (mok$a) and becomestranquil through Sankara's gracious withdrawal (nime$a) of the bindingactivity of Maya. Through the concomitant expansion (unme$a) of hisconsciousness, he enjoys divine bliss (bhoga) in countless forms,39 evenwhile delighting in the world.

Ultimately the most authentic form of God and the object ofworship is the Self.52 Mahesvarananda asks: \"Abandoning their ownconsciousness, what lifeless [object] should they worship?\"53Again:Those Who meditate on other deities abandoning attention to theirown nature [although] possessing great wealth, go begging. And evenwhen they have begged [their food, still remain] hungry.54In reality, both the worshipper and the worshipped, the bound and thereleased, are Siva:May Siva Who has penetrated and become one with me, worshipHimself thus by means of His own power that He may Himself revealHis own nature.55The basis of Sankara's divinity is His Spanda nature. Spandaconverts the cold, impersonal absolute of monistic Vedanta into Sahkara,the warm, worshipful absolute of Kashmiri Saivism. An impersonalabsolute is unsatisfactory on metaphysical grounds, and fails to satisfyman's deepest need for devotion and grace.

Until we realise ourtrue identity with Sankara, He is worshipped and conceived to be a realityalien to ourselves. While we are in the realm of creation, He too is acreation or mode or appearing of the absolute, manifest to us inmeditation, through His freedom as an eternal, omniscient being.57 Thereis no gulf between the created and the uncreated creator:Nothing in reality, although an object of knowledge, ceases to beSiva: this is the reason why meditation [on this or that aspect] of realitybestows its fruit.58The world of the senses and mind appears to the Well Awakened(suprabuddha) as a theophany, an eternal revealing of God in His creation.The Doctrine of Vibration declares that \"there is no state in word, meaningor thought, either at the beginning, middle or end, that is not Siva.\"59 Toutter any word is, in reality, to intone a sacred formula.60 Every act is apart of Siva's eternal cosmic liturgy, every movement of the body a ritualgesture (mudra), and every thought, God's thought.By what path are You not attainable?

There they becomeapparent, directly revealed to consciousness according to their manifestform. Siva is accordingly symbolized as the ground or surface ofawareness, smooth and even like a screen (samabhittitalopama).MInscribed on this screen (kutfya) are the countless manifest forms whichappear within it rendering it as diverse and beautiful as a fossil ammonite(falagrama).65 Siva is the sacred ground upon which the cosmic man^alais drawn, the absolute surface of inscription which bears the mark (cihna)of the universe. Abhinava writes:The variety of this world can only be manifest if the Highest Lord,Who is essentially the pure light of consciousness, exists; just as a surfaceis necessary for a picture. If external objects were perceived in isolationthen, because 'blue' and 'yellow', etc., are self-confined and theperceptions [we have of them] refer to their objects alone and so areinsentient, mute and dumb in relation to one another... how would it bepossible to be aware that an object is variegated? But just as depths andelevations can be represented by lines on a smooth wall, and we perceive[a female figure and think], 'she has a deep navel and upraised breasts',similarly it is possible to be aware of differences in the variegated(contents of experience) only if all the diverse perceptions are connectedtogether on the one wall of the universal light of consciousness.66Siva is the perfect artist Who, without need of canvas or brush, paintsthe world pictures. The instant He imagines it, it appears spontaneously,perfect in every respect. The colours He uses are the varying shades andgradations of His own Spanda energy and the medium His ownconsciousness. The universe is coloured with the dye of its own nature(svabhava) by the power of Siva's consciousness (citi).bl RajanakaRama says:Homage to Him Who paints the picture of the Three Worlds,thereby displaying in full evidence His amazing genius {pratibha)\\ toSambhu Who is beautiful with the hundreds of appearances laid out bythe brush of His own unique, subtle and pure energy.68Analogously, at the microcosmic level, all the cognitions andemotions, etc., which make up the individual personality form the outwardflow of essentially introverted consciousness. They are specific pulsations(yise$aspanda) or aspects of the universal pulsation (samanyaspanda) ofpure T consciousness.

For him they aremanifest respectively as: 1) Sankara's power of knowledge (jndna)—thelight of consciousness (prakdsa); 2) the power of action (kriyd)—thereflective awareness of consciousness (vimarsa)\\ 3) the power of Maya—which does not mean here the world of diversity, but the initial subtledistinction which appears between subject and object in pureconsciousness.70On the lower level, the power of awareness (citisakti) is disturbedfrom its self-absorption and begins to generate thought forms (vikalpa)within itself. Consciousness devolves and becomes the thinking mind(citta).11 Sankara assumes the form of a human personality (maya-pramatf) residing in a world of limitations and diversity.72 His conscious-ness is extroverted and generates out of itself a subtle body (puryasfaka)consisting of the three components of the inner organ of mentation(antahkararia)13 and the five subtle essences (tanmdtrd) of taste, touch,smell, sound and sight. Residing in this subtle body, consciousnesstransmigrates from one physical organism to the next and is seeminglyaffected by Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The higher stage represents a stateof introversion when the subtle body, with its transient emotions andcognitions, is withdrawn into T consciousness and dissolves away.74Sankara is both these aspects simultaneously. Ksemaraja criticises theMlmamsaka who believes that the Self is pure being alone, onlyaccidentally associated with transient perception. He explains that this istrue only of the functions of the subtle body (puryasfaka) whenexperienced as independent of consciousness.75 According to the Doctrineof Vibration, the momentary, transient nature of the object, whethermental or physical,76 does not affect the eternal stability of Sankara, theSelf. The Fully Awakened (suprabuddha) recognises this truth, while theunenlightened are always caught in the outward flow of events. The FullyAwakened yogi identifies himself with Sankara, the universal (samanya)Spanda nature, and experiences the universal flow of consciousness in allthe opposites. The unenlightened, however, who wrongly identifieshimself with the body, is caught by his fascination for the individualpulses of emanation, dispersed and separated from each other by the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Siva and Sakti   109tension of the opposites.Thus, these particular pulsations are to be totally avoided; they arepresent in the body, etc., which is other than the Self and arise bymistaking [the body, etc.,] for the Self. [The particular pulsations ofconsciousness] are the fields of sensory operation (vi$aya) of thephenomenal (mayiya) subject. Each is distinct from the others as on-going fluxes {pravaha) of perceptions (pratyaya) of the type (guna)Tamhappy' or *I am sad', which are the causes of transmigratory existence.77However, these perceptions can in no way 'be an obstacle for theenlightened'.78 Right and wrong, pleasure and pain, merge and alldistinctions disappear in the universal vibration of Siva's consciousness.Thus we read in the Stanzas on Vibration:The streams of the pulsation (spanda) of the qualities and the other[principles]79 are grounded in the universal vibration [of consciousness]and so attain to being; therefore they can never obstruct the enlightened.Yet for those whose intuition slumbers [these vibrations of conscious-ness] tend to disrupt their own state of being (svasthiti) casting themdown onto the terrible path of transmigration so hard to cross.80The universal vibration of consciousness understood as Siva's perfectegoity is contrasted with the fettered soul's conceived notion of himself asthe body. The latter's ego is a thought-construct (pratyaya) and hencelimited and artificial. It consists of particular pulsations of consciousness.Sankara's ego consciousness, on the contrary, is complete and integral(purna). Reflecting on Himself, He is aware that \"I am pure consciousnessand bliss; I am infinite and absolutely free.\"81 Immersed in thiscontemplative state (turiya), Siva delights in the awareness \"the universein all its diverse aspects arises out of Me, it rests within Me and once itdisappears, nothing remains [apart from Me].\"82 Thus, this self-awarenessis the universal Spanda of consciousness.Raj ana ka Rama explains that the alert yogi in the course of hismeditative practice gains an insight, by Siva's grace, into the manner inwhich the particular pulsations (vise$aspanda) of his consciousness arisewith their consequent effects. He constantly exerts himself to experiencethe pure universal vibration of his authentic T consciousness and so freehimself of the disturbing influence (ksobha) the pulsations have on him.83He is always on the alert to discern universal Spanda.84 Thus reflecting onhis own nature as the pure awareness that 4I am' (ahani), he distinguishesbetween the particular and generic vibration of consciousness. While the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"110  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONuna wakened is constantly subject to the ups and downs of these individualpulses of consciousness, the awakened, on the contrary, turns even moreresolutely to his true nature whenever he observes their activity withinhimself.

Through the discrimination (viveka) born of the intuition(pratibha) of the universal pulsation of i-ness', contemplative soulsdiscover Him to be their own pure subjectivity (upalabdhrta) which, as thesource of all the individual pulsations of consciousness, is their ultimatereality (paramartha) beyond all subject-object distinctions.85 Realitycannot be discovered if we think of it as a 'something' of which we areignorant but may come to know through practice. Reality is anexperience—the experience of the fully enlightened.The Nature of SaktiInherent in Siva is His infinite power. Essentially one with Him, Hispower represents the freedom of His absolute nature from the limitationsof the finite, and the freedom to assume the form of the finite while abidingas the infinite. Freedom from limitations implies the capacity to becomemanifest in countless diverse forms.86 Ultimately, it is Siva's freedomalone which unfolds everywhere as all things.87 The universe exists byvirtue of His power which is at once the universe itself and the energywhich brings it into being.88 Thus Abhinava says:The Lord is free. His freedom expresses itself in various ways. Itreduces multiplicity into unity by inwardly uniting it and of one it makesmany. ... He is therefore described as the knowing and acting subject,perfectly free in all His activities and all-powerful; this [freedom] aloneis the essential nature of consciousness.89This freedom is also the inherent nature of the Self—man's authenticidentity. Perceiving nothing but itself in all things, the Self requires noexternal aid in order to manifest itself in the sphere of objectivity. The ego,confined to the physical body and fashioned by the thought-constructsgenerated by a form of consciousness whose focus of attention is(apparently) outside itself, is not free. It is a 'non-self dependent on outerobjectivity.

Absolute independence implies more than a transcendental,autonomous state of aloofness. It requires that this autonomy be creative.This is the freedom which is Siva's power to do 'that which is most difficult'(atidurghafakdritva). His capacity to accomplish that which would belogically impossible (virodhate) in the domain of the empirical (mdyd),governed by the principles of natural law {niyati). In order for Siva tomanifest as the diverse universe, He must deny His infinite nature andappear as finite entities and \"what could be more difficult than to negatethe light of consciousness just when it is shining in full?1'91 Thus, negationor limitation is a power of the absolute. Sakti is the principle of negationthrough which Siva conceals His own undivided nature and becomesdiverse.92As the source of diversity, Sakti is the absolute's creative power ofMaya. Due to Mayasakti, an initial contrast emerges within universalconsciousness between the conscious (cit—subject) and the unconscious(acit—object). This split goes on to develop into the innumerablesecondary distinctions which obtain between specific particulars.93 Theone power made manifest in this way appears to be diverse due to thediverse forms of awareness the subject has of the many names and formsof the object.94 There is no object or event that does not disclose thepresence of Sakti. \"The universe,\" says the Sivasutra, \"is the aggregate of[Siva's] powers.\"95 Each power is a means, channel or outlet (mukha)through which Siva, though formless (anarnsa) and uncreated, becomesmanifest in a particular form.96 The very Being (satta) of an entity consistsessentially of its capacity to function (arthakriya) within the economy ofconsciousness.97 All things are endowed with Sakti in the form of theircausal or pragmatic efficacy (kdranasdmdrthya). It is on the basis of anentity's causal efficacy that we say that it is what it is and not anything else.Thus, there are innumerable powers in every object. Although thesepowers cannot be known directly, they are inferred from their effects.Change is the coming to prominence of one power at the expense ofanother. When a jar, for example, comes into being, the pragmaticefficacy of the clay ball is superseded by that of the clay jar.98 In this waythe abiding fullness (purnatd) of the one universal power, in a sense, altersas one aspect 'expands' and comes to the fore, while another 'contracts' orrecedes into the background.99 Sakti is, in this sense, in a state of perpetualpulsation (spanda\\ expanding and contracting, assuming now this, nowthat form.

Every power is like a pane ofcoloured glass through which the light of the absolute shines and assumesthe form of the sparkling variegations of the manifest universe. Theprincipal forms of power can be classified into three basic categoriesaccording to the sphere in which they operate, namely:1) The Sphere of Siva-Consciousness, The powers here include: a) Siva'sDivine Attributes. These divine attributes are five: omnipresence,eternality, freedom of will, omniscience and omnipotence. Theycorrespond to Siva's powers of consciousness, bliss, will, knowledgeand action.b) Siva's Cosmic Functions. These cosmic functions are also fiveand are implemented by Siva's five powers to create, maintain, destroy,conceal Himself and grace by revealing Himself.c) Siva's Creative Energies. The principal creative power in thesphere of manifestation is Siva's power of Maya, which is an aspect of Hispower of action. Other aspects of His power of action are Nirmanasakti,the power to fashion particular entities out of His own undifferentiatedconsciousness, and Kdlasakti, the power of time through which Sivacreates the temporal order and hence the universe of change andbecoming.1032) The Sphere of Cognitive Consciousness. The preceding sphere can besaid to have two aspects—inner and outer. The former corresponds toSiva's divine attributes and the latter to His cosmic functions and creativeenergies. Similarly, at this level, the inner aspect is mental in which operatethe power of cognition and memory along with the power to differentiateindividual perceptions.

Again, there are the forceswhich help to elevate the soul and develop his consciousness to a moreexpanded state as well as those that, on the contrary, restrict it. To theouter aspect of individualised consciousness corresponds externalobjectivity, which includes the categories of existence, worlds and cosmicforces that bind them into a coherent whole. Belonging to all three spheresboth in their inner and outer aspects is the power of speech. At the highestlevel it is the pure awareness Siva has of His own nature. In the lowerspheres it is the silent inner speech of thought as well as the manifestarticulate speech of daily life. Thus, Sakti manifests as everything that canbe denoted by speech as well as every form of speech.These three spheres correspond to three aspects of Sakti: Supreme(Para), Middling (Pardpard) and Lower (Apara). Worshipped as threegoddesses in the Trika school, this Triad is one of the most essentiallydefining features of this form of Saivism and its earlier prototypes in theAgamas. Ksemaraja sees in this Triad aspects or phases of Spanda.105Accordingly, we turn now to a brief description of these three importantenergies.The Supreme Power (Para iakti). This energy operates on the SupremeSummit of Being (parakdtfhd). There consciousness reflects upon itself asthe universal ego (purndhantd), which is the ultimate ground of allthings106 and abode of rest,107 where everything is one and beyond allrelative distinctions.108 Knowledge and action, unsullied by their objects,abide here as Light and awareness. At this level, awareness (vimarsa)includes the Light of consciousness (prakdsa) and they are one.109Consciousness and its content merge like water in the sea or a flame infire.110 We can distinguish between two aspects of this energy correspond-ing to two aspects of the supreme state:0 The first aspect is the supreme power unsullied by the products of itsactivity. This is the pure freedom of consciousness. It is the pure intention(icchdmdtra) through which the absolute affirms its absolute Beingunconditioned by the cosmic Totality generated by it. As such, it is theprimordial vibration (ddyaspanda) of consciousness free of all restrictionson its activity. It generates and contains within itself the innumerableBenevolent (aghora) powers of consciousness that bestow the fruits ofrealisation to the enlightened yogi.111ii) The purely transcendental state of the first aspect turns to immanence"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"114  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONwhen this will is disturbed and aroused out of its quiescent state. Theemanation of Totality dawns on the horizon of consciousness as itspotential goal and the will to existence spontaneously presents itself asthe exertive force that actuates it. It now acts as the Lordship (isikd) ofconsciousness which governs the universe held within it. For theawakened yogi it operates as the actuality of a conscious exertion tomake the oneness of the absolute apparent. Thus it sets into operationall its Benevolent (aghora) powers to guide the yogi's way along thepath to realisation.112The Middling Power (Parapara tokti). The Intermediate level is that ofunity-in-difference, between the lower level of the awareness of division(bhedadr$fi) and that of unity (abhedadr^i) at the summit of conscious-ness. Here the universe is experienced within consciousness as one with itwhile maintaining itself distinct from it, like a reflection in a mirror. Theform awareness assumes here is 'I [am] this [universe]' (ahamidam).xnSubject and object are equal in status; they are distinct but not dividedand experienced as the two aspects of awareness, namely, knowledgeand action.114This level is the point of contact between the absolute and itsmanifestations. It is the sphere of relatedness. Practical life is based on therelationship between immanence and transcendence and that betweenthe elements of diversity.115 Thus the energy which operates at this levelis also the basis of all empirically definable experience.116 By the powerof awareness in this intermediate state we can make contact with theundivided unity of pure consciousness while we are on the level ofdiversity. However, the power of awareness operating here can alsogenerate the Fierce (ghora) energies of consciousness that block the pathto liberation by engendering attachment to the fruits of action, whethergood or bad. If through this power the yogi realises the oneness ofconsciousness and its manifestations, he is elevated, but if he fails to do so,this same power throws him down. Thus the Intermediate power plays adual role by illumining both the 'Pure Path' to liberation and the 'ImpurePath' of bondage.117 This ambiguity reflects the paradoxical nature ofthe absolute's knowledge of the universe it has willed into existence, aseither one with it or separate from it. From the point of view of theabsolute these two are complementary modes of experience, but from thepoint of view of the relative, knowledge of difference is binding, whileknowledge of unity is liberating.The Inferior Power (A para sakti). This energy operates in the Kooi(mula)"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Siva and Sakti   115of consciousness where objectivity predominates,118 and the innerawareness (jnana) of the Self takes second place to outer activity.119 Thisis the level of diversity where the beauty of the world picture, charmingwith its many details, is fully displayed:The lower (apara) level corresponds to the extension of relativedistinctions (bheda) which, like a [fine crop] of tender sprouts, are bornof the potency of the Supreme Lord's contemplation (vimarsa) of Histranscendental Light. It is the illusion of daily life (yibhrama) embossedwith this cosmic multiplicity, pleasantly various like a work of art.120Limitations which the Sun of consciousness imposes on itself shroudit like dark storm clouds. Subjective awareness (ahaipvimarsa) contracts,conditioned by the body in which it has taken up residence and perceivesparticulars (both individual subjects and objects) as cut off from oneanother and from itself. Even so, the awareness it has of its own natureabides as the Lower power, pulsing and brilliant like a streak oflightning.121 For those ignorant of its true nature this power operates asMaya and generates the 'Extremely Fierce' (ghoratara) energies ofconsciousness that lay hold of the soul and throw him down to its lowerlevels.122 However, to one who experiences the infinite consciousness ofhis own nature and Maya as its eternal freedom, it bestows both yogicpower (siddhi) and liberation (mukti).m The Stanzas on Vibrationexplain:This, Siva's power of action, is binding when residing in the fetteredsoul (pasuvartini); [but], when [its true nature] is understood and it isset on its own path it bestows success in Yoga (siddhi).124According to the Doctrine of Vibration, the soul is liberated byrecognising that 'the whole universe is the result of the activity of the[Spanda] principle.'125 Conversely, by being ignorant of this he isbound.17-6 Failing to contemplate his own Spanda nature, its activityfunctions as this Lower power and engenders gross action.127 This breaksup the unity of his consciousness,128 splitting up and obscuring it by thetension between the contrasting responses to what he seeks to acquire(upadeyd) or give up (heya).m The universal act of self-awareness(purnahantd) assumes the form of a 'drop of egoity' (ahantdvipruf) whichanimates the gross and subtle body.130 In this way Apara sakti pervadesthe vital forces (jivakald) operating in the body.131 Once the ignorance ofMaya has been overcome, the yogi recognises his oneness with Siva by the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONpower of his own self-awareness (svasamvedana). He ascends to the planeof the Well Awakened and, having achieved all that is to be achieved(krtakftya), attains both the supreme perfection (siddhi) of the realisationof his own Lordship and the lower perfections (aparasiddhi) of all theyogic powers (vibhuti) that accompany it. He recognises that even hislower embodied awareness is Para, the Supreme Goddess Whocontemplates the pure non-dual consciousness which is the innate natureof all things, and the Light of the Supreme Lord.132 Pervading Siva, thispower pervades the universe. The yogi thus experiences Siva-conscious-ness and cosmic consciousness simultaneously and this power is then saidto be 'set on its own Path1.133 In other words, it resides in one's own Siva-nature, on the plane of absolute unity (atyantdbhedadasd) whereawareness no longer moves to any other object (yi$aya). The Lower is thenone with the Supreme power through which all things are experienced intheir true universal (sdmdnya) nature as pure consciousness.134The harmonious union (sdmarasya) of these three planes areBhairava's supreme glory, the radiance of the fullness of His power(purriasakti)135 which fills the entire universe. Together, this triadconstitutes the Deity's universal experience (bhogya). By sharing in itthe yogi comes to realise the unsullied bliss of the absolute (anuttard-nanda), the supreme form of Spanda.136"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"VSakti Cakra: The Wheelof EnergiesAs we have seen, the ceaseless flow of consciousness perpetuallygenerates new forms within it as some of its powers come to the fore andbecome manifestly active, while others abide in a potential state within it.In this way novel patterns of energy spontaneously form on the surface ofconsciousness through its inherent activity, as do waves on the surface ofthe sea.1 The arising and subsiding of each wave of cosmic manifestationis marked by a regular sequence (krama) of metaphysical events.Following one after another in recurrent cycles, each sequence is aptlysymbolised by a rotating wheel (sakticakra), the spokes of which are theaspects of the divine creative energy of consciousness brought into play asthe wheel revolves. Thus these Wheels collectively represent the primalform or 'archetype-field structure' of all experience. They are infinite innumber and the number of spokes in each can vary from one to infinity inaccord with the diversity of the configurations of power which form ateach stage along the cycle of cosmic manifestation. Scripture says:These powers become diverse, increasing or decreasing in number,etc., in accord with the divine will (svatantrya). In this way, Bhairavabecomes manifest as the 'Solitary Hero', as the couple {yamala\\ as three,four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven powers, as the Lord of thegreat Wheel of twelve, a thousand or infinite spokes.

As eachWheel rotates, one power after another becomes active, taking over fromthe one that went before it and blending into the one that follows. Theflow of the energy of consciousness moves round the circle in harmonywith the rhythm of its pulsation. Thus the Wheels of Energy are thevibrant radiance of Bhairava, the light of consciousness.3 They representthe plenitude (purnata) of the absolute. K§emaraja explains that: \"theuniverse is established and exists because its manifest form is one withthe inner Light of the Lord. Hence it is said to be the Wheel of Energies.4The Doctrine of Vibration teaches that there is an essential identitybetween the inner world of the subject and the outer world of the object.5The universe is equally the outer physical world and the inner world ofmind and body.6 Thus the emanation of these Wheels corresponds to thecreation of both these worlds.7 Accordingly, Ksemaraja explains that themany deities well known to those learned in Agamic lore, grouped andworshipped in circles, represent the biological components of the bodyand the transient moods, thoughts, etc., of the mind.8 Sankara is the Lordof the Wheel (cakresa) and hence of both the macro- and microcosm. Heis the 'source of the power of the Wheel of Energies'.9 The Wheels of powerunfold within Siva's infinite consciousness, evolving as they do to higherdegrees of complexity, and then once more dissolve into the undividedunity of His consciousness. They are generated and withdrawn inharmony with the evolution and involution of Siva's Spanda energy. Thisexpands and contracts at the transcendental level, beyond the categoriesof existence (tattva), generating as it does so, all these powers.10Abhinava explains:[We can see the many colours] white, red and yellow of the peacock'sfeathers when they are unfurled, but not when they are folded together.Similarly, if the Lord of the Wheel does not unfold [His powers, He]merges with [His own nature] full of subtle consciousness. He manifestsvariously through the unfolding and contraction [of His power]. Thusby the contraction of one [aspect] and through the unfolding of another[He] appears in [many] forms ranging from the single spoked Wheel tothe Wheel of a thousand spokes.11To witness this expansion and contraction and to worship its diverseaspects as Goddesses seated in the circles generated by this activity andrecognised to be one's own authentic nature, is to worship the SupremeLord in the fullness of mystic absorption (turiya).12 Each Wheel rotates,radiant with the light of consciousness, in a space or spiritual sky (vyomari)"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  119of its own. Pure consciousness (saipvid) is the universal space or GreatSky {mahdvyomari)n which embraces all the spiritual extensions whichmake room for the unfolding of every configuration of experience. Calledthe 'Sky of Siva' (sivavyoman), the 'Abode of Brahman' (brahmasthana)and the 'Abode of the Self (dtmasthdna), it is at once Bhairava and thesupreme form of Sakti (pardkuntfalini),14 equally consciousness and itscontents. In a sense everything, including consciousness, is empty. AsAbhinava says:The [dawn] sky, though one, appeajs radiant white, red and blue,and the clouds accordingly seem various; so pure, free consciousnessshines brilliantly with its countless forms, though they are nothing at all.l5Sakti represents the all-encompassing fullness (purnatd) of theabsolute, the ever-shifting power of awareness actively manifesting as theCircle of Totality (visvacakra). Siva is the Void (sunyatd) of absoluteconsciousness—its supportless (nirdlamba) and thought-free (nirvikalpa)nature. Integral and free, Siva, the abode of the Void, dissolves everythinginto Himself and brings all things into being.16 Fullness pours intoemptiness and emptiness pervades fullness. Penetrating suddenly into thefullness of consciousness, all things are at once made part of its absoluteand undefinable nature. \"[For the yogi who] penetrates into the non-dualVoid,\" teaches the Vijndnabhairava, \"his true nature (dtman) is theremade manifest.\"17 The Void actively assimilates all diversity. In the puresubject the flux of objective perceptions dissolves away. The externalpersonality merges in the supreme subject and the seed of all futurediversification is destroyed, thereby freeing the yogi of all causal andkarmic necessity: \"Well concealed, and attainable only with great effort,is the subtle Void, the chief root of liberation\".18To experience this emptiness, the yogi must penetrate into the initialinstant of perception (prdthamikdlocana) when he directly perceives theobject and no dichotomyzing thoughts have yet arisen in his mind. In thisway he finds the centre (madhyamapada) between one thought and thenext or between two perceptions.19 In the Heart of his own consciousness,apparent in the Centre, he experiences the initial expansion (unmesd) ofawareness at its most intense, just as it is about to blossom into thediversity of thought.20 All objectivity is then suddenly dissipated and theyogi shares in the extraordinary sense of wonder (camatkdrd) the Lord ofConsciousness Himself experiences when he perceives the ideal universewithin Himself on the point of emergence. Through this sudden eruptioninto reality, brought about by a supreme act of grace, the yogi is instantlyabsorbed in the fully expanded state of the Great Void (mahdsunya).2X He"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"120  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthen moves freely, without obstruction or effort, in the Sky of Conscious-ness (ciddkdsa) beyond time and space, at one with the power of awarenesswhich wanders there in its infinite freedom. When all supports have fallenaway, the yogi experiences the Void of the primal vibration (spanda) ofthe absolute as a single, undivided mass of consciousness (cidekaghana).The rays of the Wheels of his powers, both physical and mental, are drawninto the vibrating emptiness and the yogi is plunged in the direct actualityof the Present. He thus frees himself from the tyranny of the flow of timefrom the past to the future.Having checked the rays of one's own Wheel of Energies and drunkthe incomparable nectar [of self-realisation], one remains fully satisfiedin the [eternal] present, unconditioned by the two times [of past andfuture].22Merged in the incessant systole and diastole of the Heart ofconsciousness, the yogi is no longer a victim of time but its master. He isthe conqueror of time, one 'who delights in the relish of devouring time'(kdlagrdsarasika) and assimilating it into his own eternal consciousness:[For the yogi] past and future are not different from the present;it is the present itself which becomes divided by the past and the future.When they no longer exist, the present also ceases to exist. The yogi,resting even for an instant is this ocean of consciousness, intent ondevouring time, becomes instantly a 'Wanderer in the Sky' (khecara)[and is liberated].23According to the Svacchandabhairavatantra, there are variousdegrees of Voidness. The yogi must traverse them all if his extrovertedconsciousness is to be brought completely to rest in its innate nature. Theunchanging (akrama) Goddess of Consciousness, the embodiment ofmystic absorption (turiya), then appears within the Great Pervasion(mahdvydpti) of the Supreme Void.24 This, the Void beyond all degreesof emptiness is called 'Fullness'(asuny a—literally, the 'non-void9). It isdescribed as the compact mass of consciousness and bliss which is the puredynamic Being (sattdmdtra) of both the existent and the non-existent.25 Itabsorbs all the levels of Voidness and contains them all, pervading themas does oil sesame seeds.26 The 'Void beyond Mind' which precedes it isthe transcendental experience of Siva. If the yogi manages to rise beyondthis transcendental emptiness, he attains the highest Void which is that ofthe supreme form of Siva (paramasiva). Here he experiences a state oftranscendence in immanence and immanence in transcendence.27 Inner"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  121and outer become one in the unifying experience of undivided conscious-ness. Voidness dissolves into Voidness until the yogi reaches the highestlevel of undifferentiated consciousness. Free of thought, beyond alldistinctions of immanence and transcendence, Siva and Sakti,28 he attainsthe supreme place of rest (yisrantisthana).When, by means of this practice, the unfolding universe dissolvesaway in the Void and all that qualifies it in the Sky, and when this Void[itself] dissolves away [like a drop of water in the sea], the Good(anamdya) alone abides. This, O Brahmin, is the essence of the trueteachings.29In one of the few places where the author of the Stanzas on Vibrationtakes time to indulge in polemics, he points out that the Voidness (sunyata)of the vibrating power (spanda) of consciousness, manifest when alldiversity disappears, should not be confused with an empty 'nothing'. Theuniverse of diversity is not annihilated, but recognised to be one. It is voidin the sense that it is universally manifest and hence has no distinguishingfeatures. Eternal and free of the contraries, it cannot be contrasted withanything else.30 Intuited as the throb of one's own awareness, it is neverknown objectively and hence is essentially undefinable.31 Although it issaid to be the destruction of all objectivity, the Void is not a state of'non-being' (abhava). Ksemaraja quotes the Svacchandatantra as saying:The non-void is described as the Void while the latter is nothing atall. O Goddess, that is considered to be nothing wherein all phenomena(bhdva) are destroyed [by losing their phenomenal nature].32There can be no place anywhere in experience where we can discoverthat which is not. The light of consciousness illumines even that which weunderstand to be non-existent.33 Being and non-being are merelyconceived distinctions; both are qualities superimposed on that which ispresented directly to consciousness. The absence or non-existence of anobject in a particular place is just as much a positive reality as is itspresence. Both the perception of its presence as well as its absence areequally apparent to consciousness.34Although the non-dualist Saiva agrees with the Buddhist whomaintains that the true nature of things is essentially unspecifiable(anirdesya), he does not agree that all determination of the emptiness ofultimate reality is an error. Ksemaraja explains that the highest level ofVoidness is the emptiness of reflective awareness, the pure undifferentiated"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"122  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONpulsation of the power of consciousness, grounded in the consciousnessand bliss of the Self—the Supreme Lord (paramesvara) of the universe.35If the Buddhist denies the existence of a perceiving subjectivity, how canhe say that he has experienced emptiness? An experience of Voidnessdevoid of the awareness of Self is, from this point of view, little better thanthat of deep sleep (susupti). But even then a total loss of all subjectiveawareness is impossible. Even in deep sleep, or in certain states ofcontemplative absorption accompanied by ego-loss, some subjectiveawareness must persist. It would be foolish to believe, say the Stanzas onVibration, that the subject ceases to exist in these states just because theeffort normally directed towards perceiving his object ceases.36 Once wehave fallen deeply asleep there would be no way we could wake up if thesubject who directs the movement of awareness out to the objective worldceased to exist. Moreover, if ego-loss is an experience, there must besomeone who experiences it.37 When we awake from deep sleep, weremember that we were sleeping; we can recall that something happenedalthough we do not know what it was. We could not therefore have beentotally unconscious.38Moreover, any state liable to subsequent recall as an event in the pastcannot be ultimate. The experience of 'I am' (aharri) pervades all possiblestates whether they be the deeper ones of contemplative absorption(samadhi) or those closer to the surface consciousness (yyutthana) of thewaking state. The supreme state is uncreated (akrtrimd) and full ofconsciousness and action39 while all the lower states are transitory(kdddcitka) and creations of the higher. The emptiness of ego-lossexperienced in certain types of absorption are liable to subsequent recalland are therefore transitory, artificial states which must be transcended toachieve the uncreated voidness of pure T consciousness which, becauseit is always present, can never be recollected.40 Far from being the ultimatereality, the emptiness of ego-loss can be an obstacle in the way of attainingthe supreme realisation.41 It separates the lower levels of consciousnessbased on subject-object distinctions from the higher level of pure Tconsciousness, the fullness (asunya) of the empty (sunya). Unlike the lowervoid of ego-loss, the Supreme Sky (paravyomari) of T consciousness isbrimming over with countless power of which Siva is the master. ThusSiva, Whose body is pure consciousness (vijnanadeha),42 is the Lord ofthe Wheel of Energies, each of which represent aspects of His divinemajesty, the power of His sovereignty (aisvarya) and freedom (svatantrya).As His Wheel of Energies revolves, the universe is created and destroyed43manifesting in this way His power.

Abhinavaexclaims:It is Siva Himself, of unimpeded will and pellucid consciousness,Who is even [now] sparkling in my heart. It is His highest Sakti HerselfWho is ever playing at the edge of my senses. The entire world glows atone with that bliss [of 'I-ness']. Indeed, I know not what the word'Sarpsara' refers to.47In our failure to contemplate the Lordship of our own nature,consciousness generates thought forms (yikalpa) which rise and fall as theWheel of Energies rotates and we are caught in the seemingly endlesswandering from birth to birth. Bhagavatotpala quotes Naradasamgrahaas saying: \"all thought is samsara, there is no bondage except thought.'*48Trapped by thought on the periphery of the movement of the Wheel, welose hold of the inwardly unchanging nature of reality and are entangledin the fickle, transient and diverse nature of its outward appearance.49Conversely, when through an act of self-awareness, the restless movementof the mind (citta) is quelled and thought turns in on itself, the yogi realisesthe true nature of Samsara to i>e the Wheel of Energies and is no longerbound, even in the midst of the change and diversity of the world.Worthy of attainment is that reality in which the yogi, brilliant withthe rays of [his] consciousness fully formed, is established.

It represents the twelve aspects of (KdlasankarsinV (TheAttractress of Time), the Goddess of Consciousness. Technically called4the Wheel of the Absolute' (anuttaracakra), all the other Wheels emergefrom it and are all eventually dissolved in it.52 Subject, means ofknowledge, object and pure cognitive awareness (pramiti) are symbolisedby Wheels containing eight, twelve, sixteen and four elements respectively.The twelve-spoked Wheel thus represents the cognitive cycle (pramdna-cakra) and is symbolised by the sun which passes through the twelve signsof the zodiac in the course of a year.53This Wheel represents, amongst other things, the twelve senses, thatis, the intellect (buddhi) and mind (manas) together with the five organsof knowledge (jndnendriya) and the five organs of action (karmendriya).5*It also represents the twelve vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet (excludingr, f, 1, I,), symbolising the processes and forces operating directly withinSiva-consciousness (rather than Sakti, the universe, which is symbolisedby the consonants).55 Again, the twelve phases represent the threegoddesses Para, Parapara and Apara, each subject to a cycle of arising(srsfi), persistence (sthiti) and withdrawal (samhdra), together with themanifestation of their own undefinable nature (andkhya). As phases inthe cognitive cycle, the twelve powers are worshipped as twelve Kails,normally divided into three groups of four. They are the subject, themeans of knowledge and the object, each appearing in the process ofemergence, persistence, withdrawal and an undefinable state (andkhya)beyond them.56 According to Ksemaraja, this cycle gives rise to a four-foldcycle of cosmic creation and destruction consisting of:1) The initial exertion (udyoga) that arises within the body of theabsolute that leads to its transformation into the universe.2) The actual manifestation (avabhdsana) of the universe withinthe absolute.3) The relishing (carvana) or reflective awareness of the appearing ofthe universe within consciousness.4) The destruction (vildpana) or withdrawal of the universe back intothe absolute when it resumes its pristine form as the radiant, Undefinablepower (andkhyasakti) of pure consciousness.57"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  125This is just one possible way of analysing the Wheel's motion. In fact,it unfolds in many ways, both sequentially and instantaneously,assimilating into itself as it does so the subject, object, means ofknowledge and resultant cognitive awareness. The yogi can, by closeattention (avadhdna), observe the movement or Spanda of this Wheel inthe course of each act of cognition, as it moves from the centre or 'Heart'(hfdaya) of pure consciousness out to the periphery, where it becomesmanifest as sense objects. In this way the yogi comes to realise that all iscontained within, and generated through, the cycle of consciousness(samviccakra). Every sound, taste, smell—anything he then perceives—occasions in him a profound state of contemplative absorption. Abhinavadescribes the sequence (krama) of events in the process of this realisationas follows:This Wheel of the Absolute (anuttaracakra) flows out from theHeart throught the void of the eyes, etc., onto each sense object. The raysof this Wheel progressively engender the Fire [of the subject], Moon [ofthe object] and Sun [of the means of knowledge], in [each phase] of thedestruction, creation and persistence of the external world. In this way[the yogi] should contemplate [how everything] in the field of sound, etc.,becomes one with this Wheel as it falls upon it along the path of thevoidness of the sense of hearing, etc.. This Wheel, which is all things, likea universal monarch, [is followed by its vassals, the senses] wherever itfalls in this [all-embracing] process. In this way the Cosmic Path(adhvari) [of emanation] spontaneously merges with the great Wheel ofBhairava and [His] surrounding [goddesses] of consciousness. Then,even though the universe has merged [into it] leaving behind nothing butits faint latent trace, contemplate this great whirling Wheel as theoutpouring {ucchalatta) of one's own nature. When all the fuel [ofobjectivity] is consumed [in the fire of the Wheel] and its latent traces aredestroyed, contemplate the Wheel on the verge of extinction, in theprocess of extinction [and finally as totally] extinct. In this way, by thismeditation, the universe dissolves into the Wheel and this intoconsciousness, which finally shines forth void of all objects. The natureof consciousness is such, however, that there is again a new creation, forsuch [is the activity of the] Goddess of Consciousness (cinmahesvari). Hewho every instant dissolves the universe thus into his own consciousnessand then emits it is eternally identified with Bhairava.58Abhinava adds that this process is common, in its basic form, to all themeditations leading to the realisation of the absolute (anuttara).59Moreover, the yogi can meditate on other Wheels apart from this one andstill be graced with the same fruits.60 To be successful, however, he must"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"126  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONidentify with the Lord of the Wheel Who resides in its centre as the pure Tconsciousness, which is the impelling force (anupranitvd) behind theemanation and movement of its powers. Ksemaraja refers to Him as the'Churning Bhairava' {manthanabhairava) because 'He engenders thecreation, etc., of all things [by arousing] and churning His own power.'61Siva churns and whirls the energies around Himself, creating anddestroying the universe through the pulsation (spanda) of His universalwill62 while He abides unmoving (acala) in the Heart—the centre ofthe Wheel.He, Siva, the One of unmeasured {akalita) greatness pulsing andself-established, measures out (kalayati) in the Heart, the universe fromEarth to Sadasiva, and by diverse conjunctions [of aspects of His nature],emanates the wonderful sport of emission and withdrawal.63In the centre, Siva is free in the greatness of the Wheel: He is not aslave of its operations.64 Fully Awakened, He sees and contemplates itsmovement and effects in all of life's daily activities. The individual soul,bound by the Wheel of the world and of the body, is liberated the instanthe discriminates between himself as the embodied and the 'body-world'helives in.65 By experiencing the entire universe ranging from Earth, thegrossest, to Siva, the subtlest, he recognises that he is Siva,66 the pure Tconsciousness which eternally delights in the play of the Wheel.Sambhu triumphs [over all] by the glory of [His] incomparable andundivided Bliss.

TheStanzas on Vibration declare:But when [the mind of the fettered] is firmly established in one place,then generated and withdrawn [by him at will], his state becomes that ofthe [universal] subject. Thus he becomes the Lord of the Wheel.68Ksemaraja, in his Heart of Recognition {Pratyabhijnahrdayd),explains where the 'one place' the yogi should fix his attention is found:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  127Then, by becoming absorbed in the integral 4I-ness' which is the blissof the light of consciousness and the power of the Great Mantra, [theyogi] achieves mastery of the circle of the deities of his own consciousnesswho engender perpetually the emanation and withdrawal of all things.69To become Lord of the Wheel and be liberated, the yogi must becomeone with the absolute (anuttara), identified with the power residing in thespace of the Heart of consciousness. The yogi who grasps the true natureof the absolute need not know or practice anything else, not evencontemplation of the Wheel of Energies.70 The yogi who is unable tomerge directly with the absolute is instructed to penetrate the Centre of theWheel by contemplating its universal activity and concentrate on the greatwhirling Wheel as the vibration of his own nature.71 Through the power ofthe Great Mantra—T (aham)—the yogi must vibrate the circle of powers,thus saturating the rays of his own consciousness with the plenitude ofself-awareness. Whatever he perceives is then filled with the pulsation{spanda) of the light of his self-realisation:[The yogi experiences] stability, satisfaction and merger in the Lightto the degree in which consciousness deploys itself and progressivelycovers objectivity. [He experiences] there the vibration which allows himto realise the supreme freedom everywhere pervaded by this essence.72The unfolding of the Wheel of Energies confers upon the yogi theenjoyment (bhoga) and bliss (dnanda) of cosmic consciousness. When theWheel contracts, the yogi's individuality fuses with pure consciousnessand he experiences its unconditioned freedom (svatantrya). In these twomovements yogic powers (siddhi) are conferred by the particular waves ofenergy (yisesaspanda) of the universal vibration (samanyaspanda) ofconsciousness which is the source of liberation (moksa). Mastery over allthings and the realisation of the oneness of consciousness are thus achievedby discovering oneself to be the Lord of the Wheel (cakresvaratvasiddhi).This liberating realisation issues from a state of uninterrupted absorptionin the vibration (spanda) of consciousness both in the ecstasy ofcontemplation 'with the eyes closed' (nimilanasamadhi), and when theyogi has risen out of it (vyutthdna), to regain the more normal wakingconsciousness which for him is transformed into a state of contemplation'with the eyes open' (unmllanasamadhi). Thus, whether his eyes are openwhen awake, or closed when sleeping or meditating, the yogi merges withthe pulsation of consciousness which moves like a fire-stick between thesetwo poles generating in him the brilliance of enlightened consciousness73"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONand he is liberated while still residing in the body:If [the yogi] resides without a break for three hours in his own naturewhich shines once [and forever], is free of diversity and is absorbed incontemplation, the mothers Brahmi, etc., and the mistresses of yogarealised by practice centred on that Wheel together with the Heroes,Aghora, etc., the Lords of the Heroes and the nine-fold god, etc., allbecome fully manifest and the perfections (siddhi), which are the powersgenerated by practising [attention to the movement of] that Wheel, areattained. These [powers] possess Bhairava's energy.

All these liberate him through this very body itself and[bestow upon him] Supreme Perfection (paramasiddhi) [in the practiceof yoga which is the realisation of his immanence everywhere] in thecosmic order ranging from Earth to Siva.74Thus for the enlightened yogi, the power (prabhava) of the Wheel ofEnergies is the Light (prabha) which illumines his mind and the divinebreath of the spirit which blows (yati) within him as pure—'I-ness\\ Itimpels his every act and perception. Presiding over and sanctifying hismind and body, it brings all things to rest within his own nature.75 Again,it bestows upon the yogi \"the ability to ascend in terms of his own essentialnature to ever higher levels by foresaking the lower ones.\"76 The yogipenetrates into the Great Light which is his free, undivided nature throughthe divine rays of his consciousness gathered together in the Wheel ofEnergies.77 The Wheel is thus the source of the spiritual power the yogienjoys when he achieves the object of his meditation through grace andhis purified intuition.78 But as K$emaraja is quick to point out:It is only a few who, [blessed with] the wealth of absolutecontemplation (anuttarasamadhi), ascend intuitively (dhi$ana) intothe light of Saftkara which is their own true nature and lordship of theWheel of consciousness; others, afflicted by embodied egoity, donot do so.79The Wheel of Energies can function in two opposite ways. It caneither be the source of bondage for those deluded by Maya, or elserepresent the powers the enlightened achieve through yogic practice.80The same forces which bind and condition man can also lead him to thehigher levels of enlightenment. That which binds the ignorant sets freethe man of wisdom.81 We shall see how this works in the following"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  129account of the Wheels of Energies contemplated in the Spanda traditionas presented by Ksemaraja.The Wheel of VamesvariAgain borrowing from Krama doctrine, Ksemaraja explains that thepure universal pulsation of consciousness (sdmanyaspanda) is manifest infive cycles or pulses of power (visesaspanda) represented by five concentriccircles. These circles symbolise the states of individualised consciousnessranging from the subtlest, most internal and subjective to the grossest,most external and objective. Four of these groups of energies82 serve as alink between absolute, unmanifest consciousness and the realm ofmanifestation. They are:1) the circle of Khecarl energies which constitute the individualsubject,2) the circle of Gocari energies which are the powers of the innerorgan of mentation (antahkararia),3) the circle of Dikcarl energies which are the powers of thesenses, and4) the circle of Bhucari energies which represent the outer objectsof the senses.5) In the centre of these four circles is the fifth—the circle of pureconsciousness. It represents the absolute as cosmic motion transfiguredinto the inner revolving power of pure consciousness. The centre of thefifth circle is empty. In the Void of the Centre the power of awareness(cicchakti) is 'established on the thought-free plane of the SupremeLord's inner nature'.83This power wanders in the void of the absolute, the sacred spacewhich abides for the divine eternity before the cosmogonic split betweensubject and object occurs. It is the primordial outpouring (ullasa) of theundivided awareness of universal consciousness within the 'own nature'(svarupa) of all things and within which all spatially perceived diversity(disyamanabheda) emerges. This power is the Supreme Goddess Whoacts as the root-consciousness and ground of sensory percepticn. Shepersonifies the powers of the internal and external senses as well as theirobjects, both inner emotive states, thoughts, etc., and outer physicalsensations. In Her wanderings in the Sky of Consciousness (cidakasa) Sheperceives all things.

Hencethis Goddess is called 'Vyomavamesvari\\85 'Vyomesvari' or simply'Vamesvar!.86 She is the Goddess (isvari) Who resides in the Sky (vyoman)and emits, spits out or vomits (Sanskrit root Vam) the universe of personalexperience out of the universal experience of the absolute, much as aperson suffering from cholera vomits out everything in his stomach.87 Sheis the fullness (purnata) of pure consciousness and the source of the otherlimited forms of awareness manifest as Her four circles of powers.88 Shepersonifies the pure subjectivity which operates in all individual subjectsand becomes manifest at the instant of complete realisation.89 K§emarajaexplicitly identifies Vamesvari with the Spanda principle90 that bringsabout the extending perception (pratha) of the Triad of powers, Supreme(para), Middling (parapara) and Inferior (apara). Thus She impels everyform of emanation at all levels of manifestation.91As Her name 'Varna' (meaning 'left', 'perverse' or 'contrary')indicates, She accounts for a reversal or, more precisely, a 'double-reversal' within the absolute. For the unenlightened She is the source ofdiversity and, as such, She is the potential cause of bondage—the 'reverse'of Siva's state of unity and freedom. For the enlightened She is the powerof awareness which 'runs counter to the normal course of transmigratoryexistence'.92 For them, Varna represents the spiritual energy (kuntfalini)latent in man when it awakens and illumines his consciousness.93 Herpowers: \"lay hold of, and throw down from a great height the essence ofdiversity and bestow the perfect oneness (abheda) of unity in the midst ofmultiplicity (bhedabheda).\"94 The fettered soul is caught in the force ofthe downward rush of the flux of emanation from the undivided (abheda)level to that of division (bheda). The enlightened soul, however, mergesin the current which flows from the level of diversity to that of unity.The Circle of Khecari Energies, The previous level was the sphere of theuniversal subject; this level is the sphere of the individual subject. Whilethe former represents the experience of the oneness of pure consciousnessenjoyed by the enlightened, this circle represents the powers whichaccompany this realisation. The powers of Khecari are the very essence ofthe expansion of consciousness and bliss. They are the attributes ofconsciousness when it is in its most expanded, unconditioned state.

The word *go\\ Ksemaraja tells us, means'speech'. Accordingly, the three powers which operate in this sphere arethe primal energies of the mind (antahkarana) said to constitute the subtle,inner discourse (sarnjalpa) of thought. For the unenlightened theseenergies function via the intellect (buddhi), ego (aharnkard) and mind(manas) as the powers to determine distinction (bhedaniscaya), to identifythe Self with diversified objectivity (bhedabhimana) and to form thought-constructs centred on diversity (bhedavikalpa), respectively. For thosewho enjoy a state of grace, they give rise to pure determinate awareness inthe intellect (i.e., the direct experience of unity); pure self-arrogation in theego (i.e., the reflective awareness that 'I am Siva'), and pure intent in themind (i.e., the synthesis of diversity into a unified whole).The Circle of Dikcari Energies. Moving further out we reach the sphereof the ten senses (five of knowledge and five of action), symbolised by theten directions (dik). Through these sensory powers the unenlightenedperceive only multiplicity. When these same powers have been purifiedand energized by Siva's grace, the awakened yogi perceives through themSiva's pure unity revealed in the diversity of sensations.95The Circle of Bhucari Energies. This is the outermost circle—the sphereof objectivity—'Earth' (bhii). The energies operating in this spheremanifest as the five objects of the senses: form, taste, sound, smell andtouch. The enlightened experience their consonant harmony (tanmayd)with the senses and so their ultimate identity with consciousness. Thesepowers 'are manifest as the body of the light of consciousness for theawakened, while they display limitation everywhere to others.'96"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"132  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe Wheel of the SensesSensory activity is the most tangible expression of the power ofconsciousness to know and act. The physical organs of sight and hearing,for example, are merely 'doors' (dvara) or channels through which thispower flows; they do not in themselves account for the sensory perceptionof light and sound.97 They are merely the locii (golaka) of particularaspects of the pervasive power of universal consciousness to know allthings in all possible ways. Ksemaraja explains that the Lord ofConsciousness operates the body and senses of each individual by Hisown power of Maya.98 The senses are instruments of the power ofawareness projected out of consciousness through this same power.99Thus the perceptions and activities of the countless living beings in theuniverse function as the senses of the Supreme Lord of Consciousness.100They are aspects of His power of awareness impelled by His Spandaenergy to activity. Thus the Stanzas on Vibration teach:That principle should be examined with effort and respect becausethis, its uncreated freedom, prevails everywhere. By virtue of it thesenses, along with the inner circle, [although] unconscious, behave asif conscious in themselves, move towards their objects, rest [there]and withdraw [from them].101The senses are figuratively arranged in two concentric circles. Theouter circle consists of the ten senses: five of knowledge (Jndnendriya)and five of action (karmendriya). The inner circle is the inner organ ofmentation (antahkarana).102 It consists of the intellect (buddhf), ego(ahamkara) and mind (manas). The Doctrine of Vibration stresses thatSpanda can be experienced through the operation of the senses. Bypractice and Siva's grace, the yogi attains a state of alert awareness. Hethen ranks amongst the Awakened (prabuddha). Awakened, he canperceive Spanda as the vibration of consciousness that animates the bodyand is the impulse which drives the senses. By attending carefully to thisvibration he experiences the unity between himself, Siva (Who is universalconsciousness) and the world of objects and perceptions. At first heexperiences this only occasionally, but once this experience becomespermanent, he is Fully Awakened (suprabuddha) and, as such, liberated.To understand how this works, we turn now to a description of the senses.The Intellect (buddhi). The individual soul divested of all sensationand thought reposes in a state of deep sleep in union with the primordial"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  133substance (prakfti) from which the objective world (including thepsycho-physical organism) is generated. The substance of all that canbe perceived objectively in any form, this primordial matter is understoodto be a power of consciousness technically called Sambhavlsakti.103This energy is roused to activity by consciousness personified as thegod Svatantresa, otherwise known as Ananta.104 The equilibrium(sdmarasya) of its three qualities iguna) of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamasis then disturbed (praksubdha) and the lower principles are generatedfrom them. The first principle to emerge is the intellect.105 Experienceat this level is like that of waking from sleep. For a moment we arenot clearly aware even of ourselves but merely register that thingsexist around us and that we are waking up. Similarly, the intellect isfree of both the sense of ego and the determinative mental activity ofthe mind. Thus the images that appear in the intellect are apprehendeddirectly, its function being merely to illumine the products of sensoryand mental activity106 projected onto it where their existence (satta)is registered.The Ego (ahatfikara). The emergence of the ego marks the next stagein the process through which we come to know ourselves as individualsand the world about us. The ego's function is to appropriate andpersonalise experience—to link it together as 'my own'. It arises fromthe mistaken notion that the light of consciousness reflected in theintellect and coloured by objectively perceived phenomena is the truenature of the Self.107 Thus, the personal ego falsely identifies the Selfwith that which is not the Self and vice versa.108 The individual soulis bound by this mistake in identity which functions not only in relationto the subtle, inner operations of the intellect, but also in relation togross, physical objects.*I am wealthy', 4I am thin', 'I delight in the senses', *I am content',i breathe', (and when in deep sleep) 'I am empty': egoity (asmita)is observable on these six levels.109The ego which forms a part of the inner mental organ shouldnot be confused with the pure egoity (ahambhava) of consciousness.T consciousness is of two kinds. One is pure and is Siva, the light ofconsciousness reposing in itself.110 The other is a product of Maya.The pure ego rests on pure consciousness and the impure ego on outerobjective forms."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATION[Universal] T consciousness rests on freedom whose primarycharacteristic is perfect autonomy. It is without any break, like aninward consent (antarabhyupagamakalpa). It is the Self which abidesas the living being whose nature is the essence of the light of conscious-ness, pure and unsullied by any association with the body, etc. It is[perfectly real] and not a thought-construct.111False identification conditions this pure egoity (ahanta), limitingit to the psycho-physical organism. It is imperfect (apuma) andhemmed in on every side by the limitations imposed upon it by itsphysical and mental environment. Pure egoity is uncreated (akftrimd)and free. The individual ego is a creation {kftakatvd) imagined intoexistence (kalpita) by pure T consciousness.112 Even so, there is infact only one ego which operates within different parameters. Thepure ego functions at the universal level of cosmic subjectivity (yisva-pramatfta) and the impure ego at the individual level of the Maya-subject. By recognising that T (aham) is Siva and that this ego is notthat of the fettered soul (pasu\\ we realise our identity with Siva andare liberated. We must stick to the abiding conviction that our authenticego and Sankara are identical.113 To have an ego is not in itself harmfulor bad:O Supreme Lord, although I have understood that pride isvain, even so, if I do not measure [the expanse] of my own natureby the pride of thinking, *I am made of You1, all joy comes to nought.114This pure ego is Spandasakti. It manifests as the individual egowhich transmits the impulse (samrambha) of consciousness thatactivates the vital breaths115 animating the mind and body. Accordingto Ksemaraja the Doctrine of Vibration teaches:Anointed by a drop of the nectar (rasa) of egoity even the un-conscious becomes conscious. Thus this reality, infusing consciousnessinto them, renders both the senses and the conceived subject (kalpita-pramatrX falsely assumed to be the impelling force {prerakatva)behind their activity, capable of performing their functions. Thus[the individual soul] falsely assumes that he impels the senses to action.'16The individual ego is the source of all the other senses. As uninter-rupted self-awareness, it is called the Sun of Knowledge. Around thesun of the ego rotate the twelve suns of the other senses. They emergefrom it and are drawn back into it just as, according to Saiva cosmography,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  135the twelve suns, corresponding to the signs of the zodiac, emerge fromand return to the thirteenth sun.117 Thus the function of the ego is theself-arrogation of experience through the identification it engendersbetween consciousness and the senses which are its instruments ofknowledge and action. Although those ignorant of the authenticidentity of the ego are bound by its operations, it is nonetheless anessential component of individualised consciousness. Directing itssensory and mental activity, it reflects in the microcosm the supremityof the universal ego that is the source and master of all that takes placein the domain of manifestation.Mind (manas). The ego full of the brilliance of sattva is the source ofthe mind (manas) and the live organs of knowledge (jnanendriya).Mind (manas) is the instrument through which consciousness fashionsspecific, clearly defined mental representations of the world of sensations,which pours into the inner mental organ through the channels of theouter senses and is reflected in the intellect. Like a chisel which cutsaway the unwanted stone from a block of marble to reveal the imagecontained within it, mind (manas) excludes all the sensations notimmediately useful to the perceiver and focuses his attention onto thosethat are. Without mind (manas) our field of awareness would be floodedwith thousands of indiscernible sensations. It would be impossibleto follow a sequence of events or go about any task without succumbingto a thousand distractions. A faint sound heard in the distance wouldbe registered with the same intensity of awareness as the music we werelistening to in a concert hall.Manas selects and isolates specific sensations from the massreflected in the intellect. This sensation is then compared with similarsensations perceived in the past, the latent traces of which are storedin the intellect and named according to the prevailing linguistic convention(sanketa). The two sensations—one in the past, the other in the present—are held together by the continuity of awareness between these twomoments and so we come to recognise that the two sensations belongto the same class and manas is able to form a discursive representation(vikalpa) of the sensation perceived. Manas thus not only analysesand dissociates individual sensations from each other, but also synthesisesa set of sensations into a single whole.118 For example, a series of discretesensations occurring in successive moments is grouped together bymanas in the notion of action or in the notion of relation in general.The basis of this determinative activity (anuvyavasaya) is unity-in-difference (bhedabheda) and its function, the structured orderingof sensations.119"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"136  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONManas (in the normal states of waking and dreaming) is always mov-ing (cancald) from one sensation to the next. Unlike the external organsof knowledge, manas is not confined to a specific field of operation(yisaya). It can equally well apprehend sound, taste, smell, etc., andthus relate them to one another to form a single, coherent picture ofthe world of physical objects. As no activity is possible in the absenceof a will to act, manas is said to be full of will (iccha) or desire to moveon to, and process, different sensations. It is driven to its task by theego's incessant seeking to appropriate and assimilate experience. Thepure sensation clothed in thought and differentiated from othersensations by manas and personalised by the ego (ahamkara) is thenpresented to the intellect, where it becomes known to consciousness.Mahesvarananda, explaining the process of perception and thefunction of the inner mental organ, compares its three constituentelements to waves (kallola) which form in the ocean of the Heart (hfdayd)of consciousness. As they rise out of the Heart of pure T consciousness,they carry with them some of its egoity and spill it out onto the objectof perception. The 'thisness' (idanta) of objectivity is drawn intointimate relationship with the 4I-ness' of subjectivity. The three sensesof the inner mental organ \"drag 'thisness' there [into the ocean of theHeart] and project 'I-ness' out here [onto the object of perception].\"120There is a movement (spanda) of awareness in two directions—frominner to outer and outer to inner. This movement free of temporaldistinctions,121 is a great wave (mahdtarariga) of the ocean of conscious-ness. From this great wave originate the smaller waves which are themovements of the outer senses, just as ripples or eddies follow in thewake of large waves.122 Thus the power of the Heart of consciousnessemanates out to the outer world and back, vibrating as it moves.Although the entire process of perception constitutes a single event,Mahesvarananda analyses the pulsation of the Heart into three phasesas follows.Primal vibration (adyaspanda). This is the initial throb of awarenessthat pulses in the subject. It corresponds to the tendency (aunmukhya)inherent in the power of consciousness to expand out into universalmanifestation.Intense vibration (parispanda). This is the universal vibration ofconsciousness that reveals itself in the outpouring of awareness thattakes place during each act of perception.Vibrating radiance (sphuratta). In the final phase of perception itmatures into a fully formed cognition which is imprinted on conscious-ness through the pulsing and illuminating activity of the senses. Thefive-fold universe of sound, taste, touch, smell and sight now becomes"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Sakti Cakra: Wheel of Energies  137fully manifest,123 brilliant with the radiance of consciousness.We move on now to examine the nature and function of the tenouter senses.The Outer Senses. Ail of manifest creation can be divided into twoprimary categories, namely, conscious and unconscious manifestations(cid~ and acidabhasas)—sentient beings and inert objects.124 The abilityto know and act is the very life (jivana) of sentient beings,125 and theirknowledge and action are most tangibly externally manifest throughthe functions of the senses. Coupled with the limited power of knowledge,the power of limited action (kalasaktx) constitutes the conditionedagency which operates through the inner mental organ, impelling126and guiding the functions of the senses, linking together the stream ofdata coming in through the organs of perception and the outgoingresponses through the organs of action.127The Organs of Knowledge. According to Spanda doctrine, the fiveorgans of perception—the senses of taste, touch, smell, hearing andsight—are aspects of the radiant pulsation (sphuratta) of consciousness.Each of these five senses is confined to its own locus (golaka) in thebody, situated where it can pick up the maximum amount of informationin the most efficient way.128 Like a lamp set inside a perforated jar,the light of consciousness radiates through the senses, freely limitingitself so that each one is confined to its own specific field of operation(visaya). The Kashmiri Saivite rejects the view that the sources ofthe senses are the gross physical elements. He contends that they arethe products of the ego (ahamkara) brilliant with the lustre of Sattva,119insofar as all sense perception is accompanied by T consciousness.The notions: 'I hear', 4I see' or *I smell', etc., are always attended bythe ego.130 As we have seen, from the Kashmiri Saiva point of view,perception is an activity as well as a state of awareness. Knowledgeand action are two interdependent categories; they are never foundapart.131 As instruments of the act of perception, the senses requirethe conscious agency of the ego. In the absence of an agent whoimplements their activity, we would have to posit the existence ofanother instrument to perform this function and there would be noreason why that too should not require a third and so on, leading toan infinite regress.132However, from the point of view of a phenomenology of sensoryperception, the ego alone does not fully account for the existential being"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONof the senses. The senses can have no real existence as such, withoutthe objects with which they are correlated. Thus, along with the senses,the ego, full of the inertia of Tamas,133 generates the pure sensations(tanmatra) of taste, touch, smell, etc., corresponding to each senseorgan. In this way the essential elements of sensory perception,namely, the perceiving ego, the senses and the perceived sensationare accounted for by the activity of the sentient subject.The Organs of Action. The organs of action presuppose the existenceof the organs of perception. They are generated from the ego asinstruments to implement its responses to the sensations coming inthrough them. While the activity of the organs of action is accompaniedby bodily movement, the activity of the organs of perception is not.134Although bodily movement is essentially one, it is differentiated intofive categories according to the diverse conceptions we form of itsnature.135 Handling, picking up or grasping is the activity of the hand.Excretion is the activity of the excretory organs. Locomotion is theactivity of the feet and emission that of the sexual organ. These fourare said to correspond to the outer actions of appropriation (adand),rejection (hand), both136 and neither.137 The fifth action is speech;it is internal and hence does not belong to any of these four categories.Although each organ of knowledge is invariably associated with onlyone specific locus, this is not the case with the organs of action. A lameman can move about from place to place without the use of his feet andwe can pick up things with parts of the body other than the hands.138To conclude: the inner and outer senses are aspects of the vibrationof consciousness and, as such, are the channels through which conscious-ness becomes manifest as the world of perceptions. Together theyare said to be 'the vibration of the glory of consciousness'.139 Throughthis vibration the yogi catches a glimpse of the wonder of the Divine,brilliantly manifest in its creation. By its Light, he ultimately realisesSiva's ubiquity as all things and that this is, in fact, his own presenceeverywhere."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"VIThe Divine Body and theSacred Circle of the SensesThe yogi seeking enlightenment must undergo a complete conversionor reversal (paravftti) of perspective. To know as man knows is thevery essence of bondage;1 freedom is to know reality as God knows it.The seeker then finds himself in a new existential situation in which herecognises his own authentic Being by being as God is. This is achievedby a pure and intense act of self-awareness in which the old mode ofunderstanding reality is dropped in favour of a new and deeper knowledgeof oneself as unlimited, infinite consciousness. This change in perspectivediscloses a new dimension of experience. In the moment of realisation,man and the world reveal themselves as an or.tophany in which conscious-ness of Being coincides with the worship of Being as the sacred. Therealisation of Being is fused with participation in the Holy. The sacredontophany of manifestation is realised in the wonder (camatkdra)inspired by the theophanic vision. To see the world with God's eyesis to witness the eternal worship of His Being. The organ of vision isthe sacred circle of the senses and the abode of its operation, theDivine Body.True monism (paradvaya), as we have seen, requires that eachpart be the Whole, that the Wholeness of totality be manifest in everyaspect of its fullness.2 Every existent thing is sacred and enshrinesthe divine cosmos in the fullness of its participation in Being.

Consecratedby the divine presence within it, it is the temple of God,4 the sacredplace of sacrifice and worship. We do not experience our consciousnessas something external to the body, like a blanket or an outer garment.5In the same way, the universe, with all that we perceive, is an intimateextension of our own pure conscious being.6 Abhinava writes:Thus, one should think of the body as full of all the Paths (adhvari)[to enlightenment and cosmic emanation]. Variegated by the workingsof time, it is the abode of all the movements of time and space. The bodyseen in this way is all the gods, and must therefore be the object ofcontemplation, veneration and sacrifice. He who penetrates into itfinds liberation.7Everything is a part of God's Divine Body—the sacred cosmosin which God's blissful activities are made manifest through the workingsof natural law (niyati).* The presence of T consciousness in the bodyis revealed by the movement of its limbs; the presence of God in HisCosmic Body is seen in the movement of the universe.Just as the ego (asmita) in the body flings apart the two lifelessarms by a mere act of will, so [the universal ego] in the universe [rendsasunder] mountains by its power.9Similarly, the yogi who perceives that all things are like the limbsof his own body (svdhgakalpa) plunges in the divine awareness that:'I am this [universe]' (aham-idam). Bondage is a false identificationwith the physical body and liberation a true identification with thecosmic body. Thus the split between subject and object is healed andthe yogi perceives reality everywhere, as an undivided unity (avibhakta)in which inner and outer blend together like the juices in a peacock's egg.10Each level of consciousness corresponds to a degree of spiritualattainment. At each stage of ascent along the 'living ladder of conscious-ness'11 the yogi achieves a higher degree of mastery over the cosmicprocesses taking place within his own universal consciousness. Witheach degree of empowerment, he penetrates into a fresh dimension ofexperience. In the theosophical language of the Tantras, he is said tobecome the lord of a higher world-order (bhuvana). He possesses adifferent 'space' in the pure extension of conscious Being and lives inthis world in a body suited to his new existential situation.12 At the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 141Parasiva level his body is the universe, the sum total of all spiritualextensions and world-orders. In a sense, however, because Siva doesnot confront any reality outside Himself, He has no body at all. Hisbody is a body of Consciousness (vijnanadeha), the sacred image(murti) of His manifest form.13 This is the Supreme Body (paradeha),the greatest of all bodies14 radiant with the infinite vitality (Ojas),fecund power (virya), strength (bala) and divine vibration (spanda)15of the supreme state of subjectivity (parapramatrbhava) it enshrines.This Divine Body (divyadeha) is entirely spiritual and no longerbelongs to matter. It is the Body of Power (sdktadeha), the universeof energy replete with the five principle powers of consciousness, bliss,will, knowledge and action.16 In failing to contemplate the CosmicBody of the Self, we fail to experience the sacred festival (utsava) ofthe external manifestation of the glory of its pure Spanda nature(vibhutispanda).11 We must rid ourselves of the false notion that thebody is in any way impure.18 We must recognise that it is pure conscious-ness alone and give up the fruitless quest for satisfaction in objectswe fail to realise are part of our own Cosmic Body.Once the tendency (aunmukhya) [to see external] objects ceasesand limitation is destroyed, what remains in the body apart from thenectar (rasa) of Siva's Bliss? [Thus] seeing and worshipping the bodynight and day as replete with [all] the categories of existence and fullof the nectar of Siva's Bliss, [the yogi] becomes identified with Siva.Established in that holy image (liriga), content to rest in [his] cosmicbody, [the yogi] does not aspire to any outer Linga, [to make any]vows, [travel to] the sacred sites or practise [external] disciplines.19To attain this pure body of consciousness or, to be more precise,to recognise our own body to be it, we must first purge ourselves of thelower states of embodied consciousness. We must unite the knot ofignorance which binds us and leads us to suppose that the psycho-physical organism, with all the subtler bodies contained in it, is ourtrue body. When this false identification is overcome, consciousness,which formerly seemed contracted, now presents itself in its true,fully expanded (vikasita) form. The individual ego merges in thepervasive, universal ego, just as the space in a broken jar merges withthe space around it.20 The yogi then realises that the Spanda energyof this authentic egoity does all things and that he, the individual, isthe agent in this sense alone.

These thought-constructs constitute the lower order of embodied subjectivity and,to all intents and purposes, its body. The yogi transmutes thoughtback into its original form as the light of consciousness by burning itin the sacred fire of consciousness (cidagni) inflamed by the contemplativeawareness that: \"It is I, the Great Lord, Who, as pure consciousness,always shine thus as all things\".22 This inner awareness is the divineradiance (sphuratta) of the rapture of the supreme ego.23 It is pureSpanda energy, the secret power of Mantra (mantravirya) which burnsaway the false identification with the body and with it the body ofthought.24 This is the true fire sacrifice in which, as the Aphorisms ofSiva declare, this body is the oblation.25External rites are of no avail if their inner significance is notunderstood and their symbolic function does not correspond to aninner activity within consciousness. The inner conscious processes(vasanakrama) corresponding to the outer ritual activity (pujakrama)must be understood and mastered. Whether outer rites are actuallyperformed or not makes no difference from this point of view. In reality,all of life's activities are part of the great sacrificial rite (mahayaga)eternally enacted by universal consciousness within itself, to itself.In this rite, the sacrificial fire is the Great Void (mahasunya), thesupreme reality (paratattva) entirely devoid of all division (bhedd) andbeyond the emptiness of insentience. The sacrificial ladle is awareness(cetana) and the offering is the entire outer universe of diversity,including the gross elements, senses, objects, world-orders and categoriesof existence, together with the inner world of mind (manas) and thought.26All division between subject and object is burnt away and everythingmade one with the fire of consciousness. Abhinava explains:Oblation is effortlessly offered in the fire of [Siva's] intenselyflaming consciousness by offering fully all of the great seed of internallyand externally created duality {bhedd).21The fuel offered in the fire of this supernal (alaukika) and eternalsacrifice is the forest of duality, and death is the sacrificial victim(mahdpasu).2* We must rid ourselves of all attachment, of all senseof 'me' and 'mine', however painful this may be, and thus acquire anew, transfigured body, not made of matter but of the spiritual essenceof consciousness.

Thenthe yogi spontaneously recognises the highest level of Spanda's powerwithin himself.30 All duality is burnt away and consciousness reststranquil, firmly fixed (dhruva) and free of the waves of cosmic manifesta-tion (nistaranga). Nothing remains of the yogi's unenlightenedindividuality and he shares in the pure contemplative absorptionconsciousness itself enjoys. Thus, no longer identifying himself withthe body, he recognises his true nature to be the vibrant power ofSpanda, personified as the goddess Bhairavi, and so unites with Bhairava,the Great Light of consciousness.31The first vibration {spanda) or wave of activity that rises spon-taneously out of this state of tranquility (visrdnti) is the immaculatebody {murti) of consciousness.32 Pure, undifferentiated Siva-conscious-ness unfolds in this way as the universe and displays its true nature.33The yogi united with Siva witnesses the emanation of Siva's cosmicbody as the creation of his own perfected, divine body. This pureemanation (suddhasrsfi) confirms the yogi's state to be that of Bhairavi.34In this state the yogi experiences the identity (sdmarasya) of unity anddiversity in the oneness of his pure Spanda nature. This unity for thefettered soul corresponds to the unfolding of his Siva-nature; diversity,the unfolding of Maya.35 The enlightened yogi, identified with Siva,resides in Siva's abode located in the centre between the two sides ofthis expansion. In this way he experiences the bliss of the emergence36of consciousness within his spiritual cosmic body.In the centre of his body, the yogi contemplates the power of hisown consciousness (citi), the radiant Fire of Time where all the categoriesof existence are burnt away. The perfected yogi (siddha) thinks hisphysical body to be hardly more than a corpse—mere dead matter,like all the other objects he perceives within his cosmic body. Theuniverse appears to him to be a vast cremation ground strewn with thelifeless 'corpses' of phenomena. He makes the Vow of a Hero (viravrata)to see all things, however disgusting or attractive, with an equal eye,37aware that they are all manifestations of consciousness.

Attended by siddhas and yoginls, it is their awesome (maha-raudra) playground wherein all embodied forms {yigraha) come toan end.

Enteringthis [body], the cremation ground of emptiness—who does notachieve perfection?\"40All Tantric traditions, including those of Kashmiri Saivism,teach that the senses, along with the body, should be venerated asmanifestations of the sacred power of consciousness which emits themas the sun does its rays.41 Accordingly, the senses can be personifiedand worshipped as deities that surround and attend upon the god(or goddess) who is their master. According to K§emaraja, althoughthe senses and their presiding deities do not in fact differ, the Spandateachings distinguish between them. The physical senses are merelythe external expansion (vijrmbha) of the body of consciousness(vijndnadeha) which belongs to the deities of the senses. The SupremeLord and inner master of the Circle (cakradevata) is the universalsubject (mahapramatr) Who, endowed with the sacred power of thesenses, is seated in the Heart of consciousness within the sacred abode(pitha) of the body,42 and there playfully rotates the wheels of theirpowers.43The forms and names ascribed to the deities of the senses varyconsiderably in different traditions and even in different Tantrasbelonging to the same tradition. The reason for this, according toAbhinava, is largely due to the ritual context in which they are veneratedand the functions ascribed to them. The activities of the senses arealtered by the emotions generated by consciousness, and so the characterof their presiding deities changes accordingly. Thus, in rites performedin anger with the aim of killing an enemy, the deities are representedin a wrathful {raudra) attitude. Rites intended to bring peace andprosperity are attended by deities of a peaceful {saumya) disposition.44"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 145The original rites described in the Tantras have no place in the yogicteachings of the Spanda school; even so, the esoteric philosophy(rahasyadfsfi) at the root of their symbolic significance has beenretained. This makes sense because the spiritual, cosmic body is more'internal' than the lower-order body through which the rites areperformed. It is one with the universal consciousness residing in theCentre, the pulsing Heart (hfdaya) of pure T consciousness, the 'greatabode of the universe'45 in which everything rests46 and which giveslife and being to all things. Jayaratha quotes:Although [the Light] pervades all the body and senses, even so,its supreme abode is the core of the Lotus of the Heart.47This same inwardness is shared by the sacred circle of the sensesof this Divine Body. It is the inner circle of the goddesses of the senses(karanadevatd). Ksemaraja, expounding the Doctrine of Vibration,says that they are the \"circle of the rays of the glory of the Self whichpresides over and gives life to the outer circle of the physical senses.48In his \"Hymn to the Circle of Deities in the Body\" (Dehasthadevata-cakrastotra), Abhinava describes the goddesses of the senses. Althoughthis hymn belongs to the Krama tradition, not to Spanda, it is clearthat Ksemaraja understood the nature of these divine powers essentiallyin the way Abhinava describes them here. He portrays the goddessesof the senses as seated on the petals of the lotus of the Heart arrayedaround the Divine Couple, Anandabhairava and Anandabhairavi,Who are in the calix. The goddesses move restlessly hither and thitherin search of the most pleasing sensations to offer in worship to theCouple in the Centre. Abhinava begins by saluting Ganesa and Vatuka,the inhaled and exhaled breaths (apana and prana). He then praisesAnandabhairava, the true teacher (sadguru) Who is the yogi's attentiveawareness (avadhdna) that illumines Siva's Path—the universe—by thepower of His intellect (dhi). Meanwhile His consort, Anandabhairavl,playfully gives rise (udayd) to the universe, manifests it {avabhasana)and relishes its pure conscious nature (carvana). Around them areBrahman!, the intellect (buddhi), who offers the flowers of certainty(niscaya); Sambhavi, the ego (ahamkara), who offers the flowers ofegoity; Kaumarl, the mind (rnanas) who offers her flowers of thought(vikalpa); Vaisnavi, the ear, offering sounds; Varahi, the skin, offeringtactile sensations; Indrani, sight, offering forms; Camuruja, the tongue,offering tastes; and Mahalaks.ml, the nose, who offers smell. Afterrendering homage to the Self, replete with all the categories of existence,Abhinava concludes with the words:"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"146  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONI venerate in this way the circle of deities eternally active (satatodita)in my own body, ever present in all beings and the essence of the radiantpulsation of experience (sphuradanubhava).49At the lower level of consciousness, the physical senses are hardlymore than unconscious instruments of perception. They are extrovertedand operate in relation to external objects. At the higher level, when'the island of embodied consciousness' has been destroyed and submergedinto the ocean of pure consciousness, the senses perceive reality in anew, timeless mode.50 They are introverted in the sense that they arerecognised to be spiritual forces operating within sacred consciousness.Plunged in Bhairava's Great Light, the senses are divinised and theiractivity leads the yogi to the higher reaches of consciousness evenas they perceive their objects. The senses thus illumine the yogi afterhaving themselves been illumined by Siva and he realises in this waythat the senses are the pure Spanda energy of consciousness whichperceives the Divine manifest as sensations.Siva manifests His freedom in the joy {ahlada) he feels as thesubject who perceives the world through the pulsing activity of thesenses. He sports in the garden of His universe delighting in the fiveflowers of smell, taste, sight, touch and sound.51 At the same timeSiva rests in His own nature. The repose He thus enjoys is the sourceof His bliss and the foundation of His freedom. Embracing the diversityof things in the oneness of His nature, Siva is content. The yogi mustseek to imitate Siva, the archetype of Fully Awakened (suprabuddha)consciousness. The yogi's experience conforms to Siva's blissfullyunifying vision to the degree in which he succeeds in maintaining astate of authentic self-awareness. The perfected yogi is always establishedin himself, reflecting on his true and uncreated {akrtrima) nature.But although self-absorbed, he is never abstracted from the world.In fact, by being constantly mindful of himself, he sees and hears withgreater clarity and understanding, and, with his senses and mind thusactively in touch with the world, his meditation matures and becomesperfect.The Spanda teachings, accordingly, instruct the yogi to observethe movement of the senses, mindful that their activity is an extensionof the activity of Siva—the universal consciousness which is the yogi'strue nature.52 In this way he comes to recognise himself to be full ofthe Spanda energy which impels the operation of the senses.53 Sensationsof all sorts thus ultimately lead him to recognise himself to be thepervasive experience of the Great Light (mahdprakdsa) of consciousness,filling both his individual subjectivity and his environment.54 Consequent-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 147ly, although many spiritual paths seek to curb and discipline thesenses, seeing in them one of the principle sources of bondage (samsdra),the Spanda teachings, and Kashmiri Saivism in general, maintain,on the contrary, that they can serve both initially as a means to self-realisation and, ultimately, are the very bliss of liberation itself.55Utpaladeva, the great exponent of the philosophy of recognition,repeatedly dwells on this theme in his hymns to Siva. Realising hisauthentic Siva-nature and thus inspired by the spirit of the highestform of devotion (parabhakti\\ Utpaladeva exclaims:May the outpourings of the activity of my senses fall on theirrespective objects. May I, O Lord, never be so rash as to lose, evenfor a moment, the joy of my oneness with You, however slightly.56The yogi can take pleasure in sense objects; indeed he is specificallyinstructed to do so,57 if he maintains an awakened, mindful attitude(prabuddhabhdva) and does not just blindly follow his natural inclinationsas does an animal with a bare minimum of self-awareness. The pleasurewe derive from physical objects is, in reality, the repose we enjoy whenthe activity of the mind is momentarily arrested and delights one-pointedly in the source of pleasure. All pleasure, in other words, isessentially spiritual. It is a state the subject experiences and not aproperty of the object. It is 'a drop from the ocean of Siva's bliss',58a small wave or pulse in the universal vibration of consciousness. Theyogi must fix his attention on the source of pleasure, freeing his mindof all disturbing thoughts and so make the transition to a state ofawareness in which his personal concerns are transcended in the pervasiveexperience of consciousness. This yogi is no hedonist. He is free ofthe false notion that the body is the Self and so does not crave for thepleasures of the senses, although he does make use of them as spring-boards to project him beyond the realms of physical, transitory objectivityinto the eternal sphere of consciousness.If the connection between 'worldly' pleasure and spiritual blissis strong, the link between aesthetic experience and the rapturousdelight (camatkdra) of consciousness is even more so. Sweet song,a pleasing picture, the sight of a beautiful woman, all these are fullof a 'juice' (rasa) which the senses relish or 'taste' and which, like food,feeds consciousness with delight and wonder (camatkdra). The sensesare the organs of this 'tasting' (dsvadana, rasand) and a state of arousedconsciousness is the fruit. Abhinava writes:Once one has overcome distraction, the pleasure one enjoys"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"148  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthrough the sentiments of love, etc., expressed in poetry or drama,for example, differs from the pleasure derived from sense objects. Thisis because [one gains access to it] by the removal of such obstaclesas the anticipation of possible personal gain. So, once freed of theseimpediments, the experience {pratiti) is one of 'relishing' (rasana),'tasting' (carvana) or 'contentment' (nivrti) and is, in fact, repose inthe cognising subjectivity. It is right to describe it in these terms becausethe Heart, that is, self-awareness {paramartd) is [in this experience]the predominant factor. Although the Prakasa aspect, centred on theobject, is also present, the sensitivity [on the part of the subject] toits aesthetic quality (sahfdayata) is a result of ignoring [this objectiveaspect] When one tastes sweet or other juices (rasa), contact with theobject of sense represents an obstacle [to the blissful experience of itspurely pleasurable potential]. Similarly, in the case of poetry anddrama, etc., although there may be no such obstacles, their latenttraces continue to be perceived. Even then, however, by removing thepartial obstruction that arises in that way [we] gain attentive Heartsand that is supreme bliss.59Changes occasioned in the powers of the senses in contact withthe aesthetic object represent a shift of awareness from the surfaceconsciousness of mundane experience to deeper levels. Here thefragmentation of the surface is resolved in the fullness of the vibrationof T consciousness in the centre of the circle of sensory energies.The senses initially resonate, as it were, in consonance with the aestheticobject, penetrating and mingling with it so completely, that the boundarybetween sensation and appreciative awareness dissolves away, leavinga state of unity (tanmayibhdva) which pervades both the senses andthe aesthetic object. This leads to a heightened state of introversion(antahpravesa) in which the aesthetic object is experienced with suchintimacy and sense of direct contact that it is no longer felt to be external.It is submerged (nimqjjana) in the field of awareness, filling it socompletely with the aesthetic delight (rasa) it arouses, that the subjectloses all sense of his individuality. Consciousness, now freed from therestrictions of the narrow confines of individual subjectivity, spontaneous-ly expands to finally delight in the untrammelled outpouring {ucchalana)of his own pulsation (spandana, vighurnana) as the pure appreciativesubjectivity.60Whatever enters the field of awareness through the channels ofthe senses and mind affects the perceiving subject and brings him tolife, as it were, as the centre of awareness in the world of perceptions.The influx of sensations is a stream of energy which 'feeds' the vibrantpower of consciousness much as the vital breath vitalises the limbs"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 149of the body. Spanda is this dynamically effective character of conscious-ness—its vitality (virya) and fecund power (ojas) apparent as thebeauty (kdntatd) of all its manifestations.61 The arousal or intensificationof this power is the most essential, indeed the basic, element of allaesthetic experience. The sound of pleasing music, the smell of incense,a gentle caress, etc., can all arouse the subject from a state of inattentiveindifference (mddhyasthya) and stimulate the Heart of consciousnessto pulsate more intensely with the subtle movement of awareness andbliss.62 This movement, or arousal of the vitality of consciousness(viryaksobha), is the unfolding of the power of awareness (sdktasphdra)which inspires the aesthete with wonder (camatkdra) and delight(ananda). It creates for him a new world of beauty, the creation ofwhich, at its most intense and sublime level, coincides with the creationof an entire universe of experience, generated by the constantly renewedemissive power (visargasakti) of consciousness. None other than thesubtle transcendental movement of Bhairava's awareness in all itsfullness, this 'arousal of vitality' (viryaksobha) is the ecstatic experienceof the outpouring of His powers of freedom and bliss.63 The yogi, fullycentred on the aesthetic object, his thoughts and senses stilled, becomesone with it and consciousness turns in on itself to realise its eternal,pulsing (spanda) nature as a divine aesthetic continuum, vibrantwith vitality (virya).64Wonder is the essence of life. To be incapable of wonder is to beas dead and insensitive as a stone. We live and enjoy the vitality (virya)of consciousness to the degree in which we are sensitive to the beautyof things around us. Each aesthetic experience, had with mindfulnessand a disciplined intention directed towards heightening our generallevel of aesthetic sensitivity, brings us a little closer to the sustainedwonder of the pulsation (spanda) of consciousness which permeatesall experience. The yogi at first practices to penetrate into this stateof wonder through the medium of objects more easily pleasing and then,as he makes progress, he learns to discern that same sense of wonderin himself even when confronted with the foulest of things or in timesof great trouble and pain.The whole of life with all its events and our reactions to them is theunfolding drama of cosmic manifestation staged by the creative genius(pratibhd) of consciousness. Siva is the seer, the poet (kavi) Whowrites the plot and is, at the same time, the Self who plays all the roles65on the stage of the mind66 with the senses as the spectators.67 Thethree moments during which the plot is introduced, runs its courseand is concluded correspond to the creation, persistence and destructionof Siva's universal creation.68 The perfected yogi shares in Siva's"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"150  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONdelight and experiences all things as full of the varied sentiments (rasa)which they, at once Siva and His wonderful creation, can impart to areceptive consciousness. The delight the yogi takes in the things abouthim transcends the pleasures of the hedonist or even those of the mostrefined aesthete. For although all aesthetic experience is a glimpseinto a different, supernal (alaukika) order of reality, the yogi alonecan maintain this awareness constantly. The moment of aestheticdelight is for him both the result and the essence of an attitude whichcan ony be adequately described as religious. Utpaladeva writes:How wonderful it is that although only one sound, that is, Siva'sname, is always on the tips of their tongues, yet [His] devotees cantaste the ineffable relish of all the objects of the senses!69For the yogi the pleasing, beautiful objects from which he derivesso much strength and satisfaction are sacred manifestations of conscious-ness offered to the Lord of consciousness in worship.70 When recognisedto be one with 'Brahman's Abode', whatever brings pleasure to themind through the workings of the senses is an aid to worship.71 Thisis what the yogi offers in the Sacred Festival (mahotsva) of non-dualworship (advayapuja), plunged in the inebriating experience ofCosmic Bliss (jagadananda). Again Utpaladeva exclaims:Drunk am I by drinking the wine of the Elixir of Immortality(rasayana) which is Your worship, perpetually flowing throughthe channels of the senses from the goblets, full [to overflowing],of all existing things.72At the lower, contracted (samkucita) level of consciousness, thesenses are expressions of the limited powers of knowledge and action(yidya- and kala-sakti) of the fettered soul. At the higher, expanded(vikasita) level of consciousness, the senses express the pure awareness(bodha) and freedom (svatantrya) of the absolute. These higher,empowered senses make the entire universe one with consciousnessthe instant they behold it in the purview of their universal activity.73These higher, divinised senses are the deities of the sensory powers saidto reside in the inner circle located within the circle of the physical senses.In this way the divine senses are symbolised as being more internal(i.e., closer to consciousness) than the physical senses. Their functionis of a higher order, serving as the organs of Siva's omniscience andomnipotence. They are not 'senses' in the normal sense of the word.Yogaraja illustrates this point by quoting the Saiva Svetasvataropanisad:"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 151Seeming to possess the quality (guria) of all thesenses, It is devoid of all the senses; . . .Without foot or hand, He is swift and a seizer!He sees without eye, He hears without ear!He knows whatever is to be known; Him there isnone who knows!Men call Him the Great Primeval Person.74The outer circle of the physical senses goes through three phasesduring the act of perception.1) The initial outpouring of sensory activity {pravrtti). Thisphase corresponds to the initial unfolding of the senses towards theirobject when they 'face' it and the subject is intent (unmukha) on itsperception.2) The initial phase intensified or stabilized (sthiti). At this stagethe senses are actively affected by their object which they now clearlyperceive and which abides at one with their field of awareness{grhitarthavisrantyavastha).3) When their operation reaches a fruitful conclusion, the objectis abandoned and sensory activity merges with the undifferentiatedawareness of pure consciousness and so comes to a halt.75At the higher level of consciousness, when the outer circle ofthe physical senses is recognised to be one with the inner circle ofgoddesses, these three moments of perception are seen to correspondto the three moments of creation, persistence and destruction. AsK§emaraja says:Even when the Supreme Lord resides in the body, He effectsthe creation and destruction of the five-fold universe of form [taste,touch, smell and sound] by the expansion (unmllana) and contraction(nimilana) of the senses.76When the wheel of sensory energies contracts, it returns to itsCentre, the Heart of consciousness where it reposes, to then expandfrom it. Then the Heart, like a vast lake full to overflowing, againpours the currents of sensory activity out into the external world.77 Thus:The channels of the senses by which the yogi enjoys the pleasureof the objects of sense are those through which he fills the three worldswith the consciousness emitted from his own Heart.78"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"152  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThe senses are outer, subsidiary cycles of conscious energy(anucakra), revolving around the core or primary cycle (mukhyacakra)of pure consciousness. They scintillate with the diversity of sensationsand resonate in the field of their awareness like the feathers of a peacockunfurled and folded back in the ecstasy of its dance.79 Ultimatelyit is Siva Himself Who, for His own pleasure,80 extends and withdrawsthem,81 not the individual soul. The outward movement of the sensesis the creative flow of consciousness from the subject who, like anocean, is the source of the waves of their activity and the final restingplace of the flow of the rivers of sensations and thought-forms thatunfold through the arising of the power of each of the senses.82 TheStanzas on Vibration declare:Indeed the individual soul does not activate the impulse of thewill [which directs the body's activity] by himself alone but throughhis contact with [his] own [inner] strength {bald) made in such a waythat he identifies with it [thus acquiring its power].83The close contact between the senses and universal consciousnessvitalises them and sets them in motion. They share in the propertiesof consciousness, just as a heated iron ball can burn, cook or give outlight.84 Spanda doctrine does not agree with the Sarnkhya view thatthe individual soul (purusa) alone stimulates activity in the objectivesphere (prakrti) by the contact he makes with it. The soul can do thisonly because universal consciousness animates him. Moreover,consciousness, which has the power to impel this activity, cannotitself be inactive as the Samkhya maintains. The influence it has onlifeless matter implies an active exertion.85 This activity is the subtle,inner outpouring of the Self (svdtmocchalatta) within the Self. Outsidethe confines of time and space, in the centre of the circle of the senses,this inner activity initiates the expansion (prasara) of the flow ofconscious energy. As the pure exertion (udyoga, udyama) of Being(bhava), it is the source of the initial unfolding (unmesa) of Becoming.86Ksemaraja explains:[By] 'exertion' (udyama) is [meant] the emergence of the supreme[level of] intuition (pratibha) which is the sudden outpouring of the[immanent and transcendental] unfolding of the reflective awarenessof pure consciousness.87The direct, intuition (pratibha) of reality, free of thought-constructs,is the supreme power (pardsakti) of consciousness. The yogi can gain"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 153this pure intuitive awareness by grasping the initial expansion (unmesa)of consciousness which engenders the emergence of thought and theactivity of the senses. It can be discovered in the subtle Centre, betweenone thought and the next. The Stanzas on Vibration teach:The expansion of consciousness that takes place when one isengaged in a single thought should be known to be the source fromwhence another arises. One should experience that for oneself!88This does not mean that the unfolding expansion of consciousness{unmesa) is an intermittent, transitory occurrence.89 As the sourceof all thought, including the notions of past, present and future,90 itstands outside the confines of time. Consciousness is in a state ofperpetual expansion. It is an ever developing process, a tiny part ofwhich we observe as the flow of events around us and the thoughts andfeelings within us. The totality of this process can never be graspedobjectively. Objectivity is a state of fragmentation (bheda) in whichdiscrete elements are discernible and mutually distinguished as individual,specifically definable entities. It is the realm within which thoughtand language operate. To grasp reality in its completeness, we mustgo beyond the partial representations of thought and speech. Toexperience the primordial source and basis of all things, we must piercethrough the outer periphery of thought and plunge into the Centre,to discover the instant in which thought, and with it, the sense ofdiversity, initially emerges. Ksemaraja cites a practice from theVijnanabhairava through which the yogi can achieve this state ofawareness:Checking [the movement of] attention (cit) once it has quit itsobject, it must not [be allowed] to move to any other; contemplation(bhavana) then blossoms forth by [experiencing] the state in thecentre between them (tanmadhyabhava).91Left unattended and undisciplined, awareness spontaneouslyshifts from one object of thought to the next. The transition from oneto the other entails a movement through a state of pure indeterminate(nirvikalpa) awareness divested of all thought-forms and perceptions.The yogi who succeeds in checking the movement of his attention,experiences within himself the subsidence of thought into the emptinessof the Centre which unfolds full of the powerful pulsation of consciousnesswithin which all objectivity merges and becomes one92 in the trans-cendental outpouring (lokottarolldsa) of its aesthetic rapture.93"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"154  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONTurning in on himself, the yogi must exert his power of awarenessto discern the vitality of his own blissful Spanda nature. Just as a distantobject becomes more clearly visible by exerting an effort to perceive it,in the same way, through practice, the yogi's own Spanda nature becomesprogressively more evident to him,94 The effort the yogi exerts to freehimself of ignorance is essentially one with the force of awarenessthat impels the senses and mind. This inner exertion is the basis ofevery means to liberation. Ultimately bestowing the bliss of self-realisation, it carries the yogi along the path to salvation with all itstwists and turns like wind which blows a cloth in various directions.95As the basis and ultimate goal of all yogic practice, this exertion is thepure wonder (camatkdra) inspired by the realisation of the essentialidentity of consciousness (cit) and being (sat).96 As such it is the divineradiance (sphurattd) of the Heart of one's own consciousness97 wherethe powers of will, knowledge and action merge in the harmony(sdmarasya) of bliss.98 Thus the highest form of worship (varivasya)is the contemplation of the inner strength (bald) or universal exertionof one's own true nature.99\"One should examine [that reality],\" says Ksemaraja, \"with theexertion which is Bhairava's nature and is true service (sevana) tothe integral inner nature [of all things] and the unfolding of the activityof one's own vitality (ojas) which withdraws all duality [back intoconsciousness].\"100Mindful of the eternal joy (dhldda) of his inner strength, the yogimust give up all desire for the fleeting moments of petty pleasure(k§anikasukhalava)m he may glean from outer objects. He musteven give up the desire to achieve enlightenment and a reality (tattva)which can never be realised through a personal act of will.102 In short,he must die to himself in an act of profound faith (sraddhd) and adoration(ddara) to find rest in the supreme reality free from the binding dichotomyof means and objectives (upeyopdyabhdva)—the reality of his perfectedeffort. The yogi, now full of devotion for this reality unfolding withinhimself and the universe (antarmukhatattva), merges into it and,by achieving the pure consciousness and bliss (ciddnanda) of the power(bald) of his own nature, achieves oneness.103The yogi is firmly established in his true nature by recognising thecreative unfolding (unmesa) of consciousness through which he is ableto know all things, whether in the present, past or future.104 Masterof the vitality which gives life to his mind and body, he can strengthenit directly without need of food or drink,105 or quit it at will to vivify"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 155that of another.106 Experiencing the eternal satisfaction of his ownuncreated nature,107 the yogi is freed of disease and the infirmities ofold age.108 Inspired by this vitality, he has the inner strength to overcomethe severest hardships and obstacles in the way of his ultimate goal.109The Stanzas on Vibration explain:Lassitude ravages the body and this arises from ignorance butif this is eliminated by an expansion of consciousness (unmesa), howcan [ignorance], deprived of its cause, continue to exist?110Doubt (sarikd) is the source of every spiritual ailment.111 A manin doubt about his true nature, and the path to follow by which hemay come to realise it, is constantly overcome by difficulties.112 \"Dueto ignorance\" teaches the Sarvdcdratantra, \"the deluded man is in doubtand thus [suffers the cycle] of birth and death.\"113 Caught betweenconflicting alternatives, the mind shifts from one to the other becomingmore entangled in its own thoughts as it does so. Doubt thus contractsconsciousness114 sullying it with the turbulence of confused thinking.115At once both the root of \"the ancient tree of transmigration\" and thefirst sprout of its seed,116 doubt deprives man of the innate bliss(sahajdnanda) of his own nature.117 Like a thief it steals away thewealth of true knowledge and reduces man to an imagined state ofpoverty in which he feels hemmed in on all sides by constraints andlimitations.118 Ignorance and its sister, doubt, are the essence of allimpurities (mala) which sully consciousness. To the degree in whichthe yogi is cured of this ailment, namely, the lassitude (gldni) of doubt,his true nature becomes manifest, just as raw gold when heated isfreed from dross. When the yogi recognises the all-powerful expansion(unmesa) of his consciousness, he is projected beyond the reaLn ofrelative distinctions between virtue and vice. Thus overcoming alldoubt as to what he should or should not do, he penetrates into thepulsing Heart of Bhairava's consciousness.119 As the Stanzas onVibration say:An individual who [though] desirous of doing various things[but] is incapable of doing them due to his innate impurity, [experiences]the Supreme state when the disruption (ksobha) [of his ego] ceases.Then [the soul realises] that his [true] uncreated nature is [universal]agency and perceiving subjectivity and so he knows and does whatever[he] desires.120The individual soul is a combination of conscious (cit) and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"156  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONunconscious (acit) elements121 brought together when he allows thepower of his authentic nature to be obscured by his own impurity.This impurity is three-fold. The first is technically called the 'Impurityof Individuality' (anavamald). Due to this impurity, the individualsoul fails to recognise his all-embracing fullness (purnata) and isdisturbed by his craving for experience (bhoga) based on the unreasonedassumption that he is incomplete (apurnd) and in need of somethingoutside himself.122 Thus it manifests as desire or attachment (rdga).123At the same time it is primordial ignorance, 'the cause of the sprout oftransmigration'.124 As such, it works in two ways. Firstly, it deprivesindividual consciousness of freedom. The yogi affected by this impurityis incapable of entering or emerging out of the states of contemplationas he wishes. Secondly, this impurity renders the individual unconsciousof his freedom, which for the yogi means that he is liable to loseconsciousness of his true nature when he is not in a state of contemplativeabsorption.125The second impurity is called the 'Impurity of Maya' (mdylyamald).This comes into operation when consciousness has been contracted bythe Impurity of Individuality. It limits the power of knowledge operatingin the individual soul through the inner and outer organs of perception.126Due to this impurity he perceives diversity everywhere.127 Finally, thethird impurity, that of Karma, comes into play when the individual,deprived of the freedom and knowledge of unconditioned consciousness,acts in his limited way prompted by desires and fears for his personalgain. Disturbed by these three impurities the soul cannot find restin himself. When he manages, however, to overcome their disturbinginfluence, he experiences the pure vibration (spandd) of consciousnessand through this recognition realises his essentially omnipotent andomniscient nature.In order to do this the yogi must first discover universal consciousnesswithin himself. Secondly, he must learn to recognise his own Spandaenergy operating in the outer world. In the first stage, the power whichflows through the channels of the senses and mind is withdrawn intoitself (saktisamkocd) through a powerful, one-pointed act of intro-spection.128 If the yogi is successful, he comes to perceive the totalityof existence reflected in his mind (cittd) and pervaded by the lightof consciousness. Thus he enjoys the inner bliss of contemplativeabsorption with his eyes closed (nimilanasamadhi). As Bhairavainstructs the goddess:Merging the senses in the centre, between the upper and lowerlotuses [of the Heart], in the void of the Heart, with mind unwavering,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 157O Fair One, attain the Supreme Bliss.129The restriction imposed on the exertion (udyama) of the sensesby the confining perception of outer objectivity is thus overcome andthe senses move freely in the 'Sky of the Heart of Consciousness'.130Like fuel in a fire, diversity is burnt to ashes and fused with the pureenergy of one's own nature.All things deposited in the fire of the belly of one's own conscious-ness, suddenly (hafhatah) abandoning all distinctions, feed it withtheir own power. When the diversity which divides things is dissolvedaway by this violent digestion (hafhapaka), the deities of consciousness[i.e., the senses] devour the universe transformed [by this process]into the nectar [of T]. Once they are satisfied, they rest at one withthe God (deva) Bhairava Who is the fullness of one's own nature andthe Sky of Consciousness which, solitary, rests in the Heart.131The yogi is now absorbed in the unfolding (unmesa) of consciousnessand becomes one withjts universal vibration.132 The 'Great Expansion'(mahdvikdsa) of the; yogi's consciousness unfolds as he penetratesand becomes one with the pure Being (satto) of Bhairava133 and thusenjoys the bliss (bhoga) of simultaneously making all things one withconsciousness, 'savouring' their essence and 'protecting' or securingtheir place and function within the economy of the Whole.134 The yogiexperiences consciousness expansion both inwardly and externally.When all things are absorbed in the introverted unity of his consciousness,it emits itself into itself freely without succession or division. In thisway his consciousness also unfolds throughout the external worldmediated by the senses divinised by the grace of his inner realisationand he perceives its transcendental nature immanentalise into theactivities of the universe. His senses open up fully in an instant as thepower hidden within consciousness expands out from it.135 The stateof absorption 'with the eyes closed' (nimilanasamddhi) thus leadsspontaneously to a state of absorption 'with the eyes open' (unmllana-samddhi) and vice versa. The yogi, with the greatest respect anddevotion for the reality now unfolding before him, must learn to unitethese tvo forms of absorption and experience the underlying unity ofhis consciousness which pervades both simultaneously from the Centrebetween them. K§emaraja explains:By [the practice] of introverted and extroverted absorption andby being firmly fixed in the Centre which pervades both simultaneously,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"158  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONhaving laid hold of the fire-stick (arani) of their two-fold emanation(visarga) with all thought fallen away, the circle of the senses expandsinstantaneously.136The activity of the senses is now unconditioned by time and space;free of all obstacles, they function perfectly. They unfold to fill theentire universe with the power of their awareness and thereby withdrawinto their pure and undivided source—the omnipresent Lord theyperceive in all things. This state of simultaneous expansion (yikasa) andcontraction (sarfikoca) beyond both outward and inner movementis technical y called Bhairavlmudra. The experience of this attitude(mudra) of awareness takes place thus:[If] you project the vision and all the other powers [of the senses]simultaneously everywhere onto their respective objects by the powerof awareness, while remaining firmly established in the centre like apillar of gold, you [will] shine as the One, the foundation of theuniverse.137The One is the Lord of the Centre Who manifests all the deitiesof the inner circle as the essence of His pure awareness (svasaijivittisara)together with the outer circle of the physical senses.138 The power ofawareness thus manifests itself on two levels simultaneously. It functionsat the microcosmic level as the power of sensory awareness whichapprehends specific objects in the field of individualised, embodiedawareness. At the macrocosmic level it functions as the divine powerof sensory awareness which apprehends the universal, cosmic objectin the field of universal consciousness. Through the practice ofBhairavlmudra these two aspects are experienced together in theblissful realisation that results from the union of the inner and outerstates of absorption.139 Thus, nothing that appears before him is anylonger confined within the ridged structures of thought and, supportless,he becomes inwardly absorbed in Siva's consciousness.140 K§emarajaquotes an unknown Tantra as saying:With one's aim inside while gazing outside, eyes neither openingnor closing—this is Bhairava's Mudra kept secret in all the Tantras.141During the initial instant of perception, T consciousness ismanifestly apparent and the yogi, participating in its plenitude,observes the outer world without being attached to any particular"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 159or singling it out from any other, like a man who observes a city from ahigh mountain peak.142 He sees the outer world reflected within hisconsciousness free of thought-constructs and so 'stamps* the outer onthe inner while absorbing the object and means of knowledge in thepure subject which grasps them as the expansion of his own nature.143K§emaraja says:By penetrating into Bhairavimudra, the yogi observes the vasttotality of beings rising from, and dissolving into, the Sky [of conscious-ness], like a series of reflections appearing and disappearing insidea mirror.144Through the practice of Bhairavimudra the yogi realises that heis the substratum consciousness (adhisfhatf)145 which both underliesand is the essence of all things. He discovers that phenomena have noindependent existence apart from him and so are, in this sense, void.At the same time, he realises that because all things are consciousness,they are far from unreal. He views the outer world yet sees it not.Beyond both Voidness and Non-voidness he penetrates into the SupremeAbode (pararn padam) of Siva's consciousness.146[The powers of the senses] endowed with the attributes of theGreat Union [between subject and object] whose form is the awakeningof man's spiritual potential (kunqtalinf), fill [with consciousness] theouter clatter of diversity (bhedacjambara) born of its intense powerand are then established in the unobscured abode of the void ofconsciousness to shine [there] eternally. Thus residing beyond Beingand Non-being, the sole protector of the unity which is tranquil andexpanding [consciousness], whose glory is all-embracing and formunobscured, is called Bhairavimudra.141Through the practice of Bhairavimudra, the yogi unites theuniversal vibration of T consciousness with the individual pulsationof objectivised 'this' consciousness. The two aspects of consciousnessare now in a state of equilibrium like the two pans of an evenly weighedbalance148 and the yogi experiences the pure knowledge (suddhavidya)that: 'I alone am all things'. Thus becoming the master of the Wheel ofEnergies he is free, like Siva, to create and destroy.149When [the yogi] is well established, without wavering, solelyin the integral egoity of his authentic nature, the Spanda principle,and is absorbed in contemplation (samavitfa), he becomes one with it"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"160  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATION(tanmaya). Then . . . dissolving and creating the universe by means ofhis introverted and extroverted absorption, he destroys and createsall things out of Sankara, his innate nature. [Thus] he assumes thestate of the universal experiencer and having absorbed all that is tobe experienced from [the grossest level]—Earth—to (the subtlest)—Siva—he reaches the state of the supreme subject by progressivelyrecognising [his identity with Him].150Thus, introverted and extroverted absorption both lead to therecognition of the pulsation (spanda) of one's own consciousness.151At the level of consciousness corresponding to Siva's basic state(sdrjibhavdvasthd), the alternation from inner to outer is instantaneouslyresolved into the vibration of His nature. When the yogi finally comesto be constantly aware of this reality, his enlightenment is full andperfect.152 Freed of all means (anupdya) and delighting in the powerof his bliss (dnandasakti), he knows and does whatever he pleases.The yogi seeking self-realisation must acquire mastery over thismovement. Ksemaraja stresses that the Doctrine of Vibration teachesthat liberation can only be achieved by first withdrawing all sense activityin introverted contemplation (nimllanasamddhi) to then experiencethe 'Great Expansion' (mahdvikdsd) of consciousness while recognisingthis to be a spontaneous process within it.153 This is done through thepractice of Kramamudrd. A passage from the now lost Kramasutraexplains:Although the adept's attention [may be] outwardly directed,he enjoys contemplative absorption through the introverted aspect ofKramamudrd. Initially he turns inward from the outside world and[then] from within [himself] he exits into the outer world under theinfluence of his absorption. Thus the sequence (krama) in this attitude(mudrd) [ranges through] both inner and outer.154The yogi must pervade the surface level of awareness (yyutthdna)with the same bliss he experiences plunging into the depths of con-templative absorption (samddhi). Submerging himself and emergingrepeatedly from samddhi, he eventually recognises that the unity ofconsciousness pervades both states:The best of yogi's, who has achieved a state of complete absorptioneven when risen from meditation, [inwardly] vibrating like a drunkardin blissful inebriation from the after-effects of the nectar of con-templation, sees all things dissolving in the Sky of Consciousnesslike a cloud in the autumn sky. He plunges repeatedly within himself"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Divine Body and Sacred Circle of the Senses 161and becomes aware of his identity with consciousness by the practiceof introverted contemplation. Thus even when he is said to haverisen from absorption, he is one with [his] experience of it.155Ksemaraja goes on to explain that this practice is called * Mudra'because it both fills the adept with bliss (mud) and is itself the bliss ofconsciousness. Moreover, it dissolves away (dra) all bondage and'stamps' the universe of experience with the seal (mudra) of the fourthstate (turiya) of enlightened consciousness beyond, and including,the three states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep. It is called 'Krama'because it is the root source of all emanation and all other consciousprocesses which succeed one another in ordered sequence (krama)and is, at the same time, their successive (krama) appearance as well.156By the practice of Kramamudra the opposites fuse and Siva andSakti unite. They yogi comes to experience the simultaneous pervasionof all the lower, grosser categories of existence by the higher and thepresence of the lower in the higher. Commencing his practice in a lowform of Bhairavimudra, the yogi conjoins the outer with the inner;then, in Kramamudra, he fills both the outer with the inner and theinner with the outer. When he achieves perfection in this two-foldmovement, he attains to the highest form of Bhairavimudra in whichthe two merge completely in the experience of the absolute (anuttara),free of all differentiation and polarities. If he fails to maintain awarenessof this state, he again falls into Kramamudra until he has finallycompletely merged all the highest states in the lower and the lower inthe higher. He then no longer needs to resort to any means (anupaya)to achieve liberation. All he says or does, anything he perceives orthinks, instantly occasions in him the highest level of consciousness.Thus the fruit of Bhairavimudra is the wonder (camatkara) or amazement(vismaya) that overcomes the yogi when he reaches the plane of union(yogabhumika),151 where all opposites merge in the radiance of theGreat Light of consciousness. The Stanzas on Vibration teach:How can one who, as if astonished, beholds his own nature asthat which sustains [the existence of everything] be subject to thispainful round of transmigration (kusrti)!15*The yogi, recognising his true nature to be the supreme subject,is astonished to suddenly discover that the individual he thoughthe was, caught up in the trammels of thought and living in a worldenmeshed in the web of time and space, does not really exist at all.159He experiences a 'turning about' (paravrtti) in the deepest seat of"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"162  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconsciousness as he penetrates his true nature. The sudden eruptionof this intuition (pratibha) arouses in him a cry of amazement as hetranscends all thought-constructs and, perfectly absorbed in his ownnature, is liberated."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"VIIThe Path to LiberationEssentially, Spanda doctrine is concerned with two matters. The firstis to impart to those who are fit to receive the teachings a deeperunderstanding of the ultimate goal of life (upeya). When we haveunderstood what truly benefits us and is worth attaining and what, on thecontrary, is of no real value but stands in the way of this attainment, we canbegin to make progress towards our goal. This is Spanda doctrine's secondconcern, namely, to show the way in which we can develop spirituallythrough §iva9s grace and the right application of the means to realisationthat it teaches. When both these aspects of the teaching have beencorrectly understood and applied, the Spanda yogi achieves a clear andpermanent realisation of his goal and is liberated, thus fulfilling theultimate aim of the teaching. The Doctrine of Vibration is not meant forthe spiritually dull. It is not for the worldly whose consciousness, cloudedby ignorance, is as if dreaming, even during the waking state of daily life,the dream of its own thought-constructs.1 The teachings are meant forthose who are awake (prabuddha), those who, full of faith and reverence,are always alert and intent on discerning the true nature of ultimate reality.This reality is understood in three basic ways. The first is purelytranscendental. The Stanzas choose this aspect as the one which formallydefines it most specifically. Ultimate reality transcends all the opposites,including subject and object. This does not mean, however, that it is anunconscious void,2 a mere absence of all existence. In fact, this negativecharacterisation of reality (which includes also a denial of all that isunconscious) implies a positive immanence in which the opposites are"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"164  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONunited in the oneness of pure consciousness that is equally Siva andSpanda, His universal activity. These two seemingly contrasting aspectsare reconciled in the third, namely, reality understood as the essentialnature of all things. Although universal and everywhere the same, it isunderstood to be the essential and specific nature of each existent as its'own nature' (svabhava). In the case of the individual soul it is even morespecific, more personal as his own 'own nature' (svasvabhava). Belongingto none other than oneself it is the pure subjectivity who perceives,experiences, enjoys, reflects, thinks and senses as well as being theconscious agent who creates every possible form of experience in all thestates of consciousness.3 The liberating knowledge of reality thuscorresponds to our regaining possession of ourselves (svatmagraha). Wemust lay hold of ourselves and abide in our authentic nature. Realitycoincides with our own most fundamental state of being (svasthiti), free ofall contrasts and contradictions. Once we have overcome the negativeforces that arise from our ignorance and prevent us from abiding inourselves, we are liberated. To do this, we must penetrate through thepulsing fluctuations of objectively experienced states and perceptions atthe surface level of consciousness and gain insight into the timeless rhythmof our own nature manifest in the universal arising and falling away of ailthings. We are not freed of the trammels of perpetual change by setting itaside; on the contrary, we must gain insight into the recurrent cycles ofcreation, persistence and destruction, or else be bound by our ignorance.4This spiritual ignorance consists essentially of our contracted state ofconsciousness and so can only be effectively countered by expanding it5 toreveal our own authentic nature as this expanded state itself, which is theuniversal vibration (samanyaspandd) of consciousness. The Spanda-yogitreads the Path of Consciousness Expansion. The movement from thecontracted to the expanded state marks the transition from ignorance tounderstanding, from the dispersion and incompleteness of a form ofconsciousness entirely centred on an objectively perceived and discursivelyrepresented reality to a direct, intuitive awareness of the unity and integralwholeness of our own absolute Spanda nature. Along the way to thissupreme realisation consciousness develops, as veil after veil is lifted, untilit becomes full and perfect in the absolute which encompasses within itselfall possible formats of experience. As Abhinava says:[This realisation] is the supreme limit of plenitude and as such therecan be no higher attainment. Any [other] attainment [we can] conceiveissues from a state that falls short of [this] perfection. Once* [this]uncreated fullness has been attained, pray tell, what other fruit can therebe [beyond it]?6"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  165The fettered soul's contracted state of consciousness binds himbecause he is deprived thereby of the subtle, intuitive insight into theunderlying unity of existence and his attention is focused instead on itsgross, outer diversity easily apparent to everybody, however restricted hisconsciousness may be.7 However, although the fettered soul in thisstate is ignorant of this unity, this does not mean that his knowledge ofdiversity is false. Ignorance entails a form of knowledge which, althoughquite correct, is binding.8 We are not absolutely ignorant of reality for ifwe were we would be totally unconscious. Spiritual ignorance is alwayslinked with some degree of consciousness. Those subject to the round ofbirth and death are not inert clods of earth.9 Thus, although ignoranceobscures consciousness, it is wrong to think of it, as dualist Saivites do, interms of a defiling impurity that shrouds it like a cloth covering a jar.10Spiritual ignorance can be nothing but consciousness itself, albeit in alimited state. Siva, Who is universal consciousness, is the innate nature ofboth its contracted and expanded states,11 both of which are forms ofknowledge, namely:1) Supreme Knowledge (parajnana) defined as the revelation of one'sown innate nature as the one reality which is the Being of all things.122) Inferior Knowledge (aparajndna) which Jayaratha explains resultsfrom the mental activity (yyapard) of the individual subject whoseconsciousness is contracted. It consists of the mental representations(yikalpa) he forms of himself and his object, of the type i know this'.13 Thelower knowledge obscures the higher and binds the soul by breaking up hisdirect, pervasive awareness of his own pure consciousness nature, free ofmental representation.14 The Stanzas on Vibration teach:Operating in the field of the subtle elements, the arising of mentalrepresentation marks the disappearance of the flavour of the supremenectar of immortality; due to this [man] forfeits his freedom.15As we have already seen,16 three factors are necessary for perceptionand thought to be possible, namely, the perceiving subject, the means ofknowledge and the object perceived. Rajanaka Rama, in his commentaryon the Stanza cited above, explains at length that these three factorscorrespond to three major divisions in the lower thirty-one categories ofexistence, namely:1) The object. This consists essentially of the five primarysensations which are the subtle elements (tanmatra) of srnell, taste, sight,touch and sound along with the five gross elements—earth, water, fire,air and ether—of which these sensations are the perceivable qualities."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"166  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATION2) The means of knowledge. This consists of the senses and theinner mental organ.3) The subject. At this level, the subject is the individual soul(purusa) whose consciousness is contracted by the five obscuringcoverings (kancukas) of limited knowledge and action, attachment,natural law and time along with Maya, their source.All these categories belong to the Impure Creation (asuddhasrsfi),which is the sphere of Maya where the lower order of knowledge operatesand subject and object are divided. Above them are five more categorieswhich belong to the Pure Creation (suddhasrsfi) where subject and objectare still united. The highest of those categories are Siva and Sakti.Combined they represent the state of pure T consciousness and its sentientsubjectivity (upalabdhrtd), respectively. The next category is calledSadasiva. Here faint traces of objectivity appear in the pervasive,undivided consciousness of Siva and Sakti. Consciousness, now full of thepower of knowledge (jndnasakti), views the All in a state of withdrawal(nimesa), shining within, and at one with its o^n nature. Tconsciousnesspredominates over 'this' consciousness which it encompasses in theawareness that: 'I am this [universe]' (aham-idam). Next comes thecategory 'Isvara' corresponding to the awareness: 'this (universe) is me'(idam-aham). 'This' consciousness takes the upperhand over Tconsciousness and unfolds externally full of the creative power of action(kriya&akti). The All now becomes more clearly manifest as anindependent reality. It is still experienced as one with consciousness but isno longer fully merged within it. Finally, when both subjective andobjective aspects share an equal status in the two-fold awareness that: 'Iam this (universe) and this (universe) is me (ahamidam-idamaham)\\ PureKnowledge (Suddhavidya), the last of these categories, emerges.The pure categories are the experience of the impure categories whenthey are recognised to be one with consciousness. They are experiencedwithin the domain of the pure universal subject the enlightened yogirealises himself to be. Mental representations (vikalpa) emerge from thispure awareness and subside into it in consonance with the rhythm of theemanation and withdrawal of the lower categories. Impelled by theuniversal will, this movement is spontaneous and free. Free of all hopesand fears the enlightened yogi sees all things as part of this eternal cosmicgame, played in harmony with the blissful rhythm of his own sportivenature at one with all things.

It is the enjoyer alone who always and everywhere abides as theobject of enjoyment. Or, constantly attentive, and perceiving the entireuniverse as play, he who has this awareness (santvitti) is undoubtedlyliberated in this very life.17According to the Doctrine of Vibration, only liberation in this life(jivanmukti) is authentic liberation.18 Liberation after death {yideha-mukti) in some form of disembodied state free of all perceptions andnotions of the world of diversity is not the ultimate goal. K§emarajastresses that liberation is only possible by realising one's own identity withthe whole universe, however difficult this may be.19 Similarly, hemaintains that the suspension of all mental and sensory activity, whichtakes place in the introverted absorption of contemplation with the eyesclosed (nimllanasamadhi) that leads to identification with transcendentconsciousness is complemented and fulfilled by the cosmic vision hadthrough the expansion of consciousness that takes place in contemplativeabsorption with the eyes open (unmilanasamddhi).20 Consequently,K§emaraja explains that the first of the three sections, into which hedivides the Stanzas, deais with the former mode of contemplation and thesecond section with the latter. Significantly, the last Stanza of the secondsection ends with the declaration that 'this is the initiation that bestowsSiva's true nature'.21 In other words, this realisation, attained through theexpanding consciousness of contemplation with the eyes open, initiates theyogi into the liberated state, which is identification with Siva whose bodyis the universe.22In order to attain this expanded state of liberated consciousness, theyogi must find a spiritual guide because the Master (guru) is the means torealisation.23 The Master is for his disciple Siva Himself for it is he whothrough his initiation, teaching and grace, reveals the secret power ofspiritual discipline.24 Instructing in the purport of scripture he does morethan simply explain its meaning: he transmits the realisation it can bestow.The Master is at one with Siva's divine power through which he enlightenshis disciple. It is this power that matters and makes the Master a truespiritual guide,25 just as it was this same power that led the disciple to himin his quest for the path that leads to the tranquility that can only be found'in the abode beyond mind'.26 The Master is the ferry that transports thedisciple over the ocean of thought27—if, that is, the disciple is ready.

Limiting itself to apoint source (anu) and obscured by the thought-constructs born of doubtand ignorance, consciousness assumes the guise of the disciple who seeksto attain the expanded fullness of his Master's consciousness.29 TheMaster, on the other hand, embodies the aspect of consciousness whichresponds to the inquiring consciousness of his disciple.30 Free of thenotions of 'self and 'other', when the disciple is liberated by his grace, it isthe Master who in reality liberates himself.31Although Ksemaraja assures us that the Master can by himselfenlighten his disciple by the initiation he imparts to him32 and the othermeans (yukti)33 he adopts, even so, he is not the only guide on the path.Apart from the Master there is scripture and, above all, one's own personalexperience,34 because, as Abhinava says:The knowledge [acquired] by gradually [coming to understand themeaning of] the scriptures and following the Master [who knows them]leads, [when] confirmed for oneself, to the realisation of one's ownidentity with Bhairava.35It is important to know the scriptures. God reveals Himself throughthem; they are one of the forms in which He is directly apparent in thisworld.36 They teach man what is worth attaining and what should beavoided37 and so like a boat convey him across the ocean of profaneexistence (samsdra) to the other shore where God's true nature is revealedto him.38 However, the study of the scriptures is of value only ifaccompanied by the spiritual knowledge that results from personalexperience. Mahesvarananda writes:Being well versed in the nature of Deity is one thing, but being wellversed in the sacred scripture is another, just as the peace of that Abodeis one thing and what worldly people experience is another.39Vasugupta, who found the Sivasutra, knew the means to realisation(yukti) as well as the scriptures and had fully experienced the one ultimatereality. Therefore, Ksemaraja declares him to be amongst the best ofteachers.40 The Stanzas on Vibration (that Ksemaraja attributes toVasugupta) accordingly transmit the secrets of the Sivasutra in accordwith scripture, sound reasoning and personal experience.41 The latter is"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  169particularly important for the Spanda yogi; he is not interested in wastinghis time in useless discussion about the experience of consciousnessexpansion and its fruits, for that can only be known for oneself.42 The yogican achieve this experience either through faith in the Master or personalinsight (svapratyayatah) acquired by unswerving devotion to God.Ksemaraja accordingly quotes a passage from the Bhagavadgita whereKrsna says:Those I deem to be the best yogis who fix their thoughts on Me andserve Me, ever integrated [in themselves], filled with the highest faith.43But while the yogi's development depends on faith and personalexperience of the higher states of consciousness, he can, and must,strengthen his conviction in the light of reason. When reason {upapatti)and direct insight (upalabdhi) work together, they serve as a means toliberation. Reason alone cannot help us, but when it is based on anintuitive insight of fundamental principles along with a direct experienceof reality, error is eradicated and the yogi is freed.44 In this way theAwakened yogi realizes his inherent spiritual power (svabala) with whichhe exerts himself to distinguish between the motions of individualisedconsciousness and the universal vibration (samanyaspandd) of thecollective consciousness that is their ultimate ground and firmfoundation.45 Thus, although the doctrine taught in the Stanzas onVibration accords with scripture,46 it is supported by reason and above allby personal experience. Thus, for example, the seventeenth Stanzadescribes the difference in the manner in which the Well Awakened and theunawakened experience their own nature (dtmopalambha),47 while theeighteenth describes the experience of the Well Awakened in the threestates of waking, dreaming and deep sleep.48 Indeed, Rajanaka Rama, oneof the commentators, explains that the first sixteen Stanzas establish onthe basis of personal experience (svanubhava) that one's own true nature isindependent of the body.49 Similarly, the remaining Stanzas also discussthe direct experience of one's own nature, but this time as the unity of allthings. This direct experience, in its diverse aspects, is both the means bywhich the yogi develops his consciousness as well as his ultimate goal.Spanda practice is based solely on the processes inherent in the act ofawareness and hence on the self-evident (svatahsiddha) fact of beingconscious. Even so, this does not mean that sound argument is useless.Right reasoning clears the understanding of false notions; it uproots, as itwere, the tree of duality.50 Leading the pilgrim on the path of truth alongthe right road of the highest doctrine, it protects him from falling to lowerviews. As such, it is the best limb of Yoga and, indeed, the only truly"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"170  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONeffective one.51 Right reasoning is based on, and ultimately blossoms fullyinto, the Pure Knowledge (suddhavidyd) that: *I am this universe and thisuniverse is me'.52 Jn this way argument not only sustains doctrine but alsoleads to the firm conviction that results in, and essentially is, therecognition of one's own authentic identity as Siva.All those who have commented on the Stanzas on Vibration^particularly Ksemaraja, are concerned to establish on a sound logical basisthat the intuitive awareness of one's own inherent existence is valid. TheDoctrine of Vibration seeks to show the Awakened yogi the way in whichhe can make the experience of his own pure subjectivity, the pulse ofconsciousness, permanent. It therefore concerns the experiencing subjectmost intimately. This is true of the philosophy of Recognition of thePratyabhijna school as well. However, the liberating recognition of one'sown authentic identity that it teaches allows for no intermediary between itand the lower states of consciousness. The yogi must grasp reality directlyin an instant. This is only possible through a firm conviction of the Selfssupreme identity, and argument in the philosophy of Recognition serves akey role to instil this conviction in him. The Doctrine of Vibration, on theother hand, chalks out a path to this recognition through the experience ofSpanda based on practice (abhydsa),53 and so argument plays a secondaryrole. Thus, although Ksemaraja insists that an understanding of thephilosophy of Recognition is essential for the Spanda yogi, he excuseshimself with the 'tender hearted' who prefer the intimacy of a personalexperience of Siva and His Spanda nature, rather than the intricacies ofphilosophy. Accordingly, when his discussion begins to seem too long andcomplex he refers his reader to the Pratyabhijna to find there thearguments which establish the permanent existence of the Self.54 His needto philosophise and refute possible objections is not however entirely hisown. As he himself points out, the author of the Stanzas on Vibrationsimilarly takes time, at least in one place, to do the same even thoughphilosophy is clearly not his main concern.55 Let us return now then to thatwhich does concern Spanda doctrine directly, namely, practice.The Means to RealisationAs a sequel to this book we will publish a translation of the Stanzas onVibration along with a number of hitherto untranslated commentaries. Inthat work we will present an analysis of the practices and doctrines taughtin the Stanzas to show how commentators have interpreted and extendedthem further by their own contributions drawn from various sources.Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessary repetition, we conclude this"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  171volume with a brief exposition of the basic principles underlying Spandapractice framed in the wider context of Kashmiri Saivism as a whole. Weare aided in this task by Abhinavagupta's brilliant synthesis of SaivaTantra into Trika doctrine presented by him in the Light of the Tantras(Tantrdloka). There, he divides all practice into four basic categorieswhich he calls the 'Four-fold Knowledge' (jndnacatuska).56 These fourcategories are exemplified by the many means to realisation presented inthe course of his systematic exposition of the Saiva ritual, cosmography,theology, metaphysics and Yoga that he incorporates into Trika.Abhinavagupta himself realised the highest levels of consciousnessthrough this 'Four-fold Knowledge' taught him by his Trika teacher,Sambhunatha.57 This great yogi taught Abhinavagupta much about therituals and practices of the Saiva Tantras known in Kashmir, particularlythe Mdlinivijayottaratantra upon which the Light of the Tantras isavowedly based. Even so, Sambhunatha was not himself a native ofKashmir but, coming from outside, probably brought with him newinterpretations of the Tantras which contributed to the furtherdevelopment of the Tantric schools of Kashmiri Saivism.58 Thus,although three of the four categories of practice are defined in theMdlinivijaya, there is no evidence to suggest that they were known, or inany way extensively applied as categories of interpretation, by anyonebefore Abhinavagupta. They do, nonetheless, characterise remarkablywell the forms of practice outlined in Kashmiri Saiva works that precedehim.59 This is particularly true of the Sivasutra and, consequently, of theStanzas on Vibration which is closely related to it.60 Significantly, onlyK§emaraja finds these categories of practice exemplified in these works.As he was a direct disciple of Abhinava, this should not surprise us. Again,that other writers do not do so indicates nothing more than the fact thatthey lived before Abhinava and so had no knowledge of them. It does notmean that they are not applicable to Spanda practice. Indeed, K§emarajamakes an important contribution to a deeper understanding of it bylocating it in this wider context. Significantly, he calls the three sections ofthe Sivasutra 'Expansions of Consciousness' (unmesa). Although this isone of many possible ways of naming sections or chapters of a Sanskritwork,61 clearly what K§emaraja is implying is that each section of theSivasutra deals with one of the three basic formats of practice that leads toconsciousness expansion.62 Thus although the Spanda texts themselves donot attempt to present a universal typology of spiritual discipline, Spandapractice can be, and has been, characterised in terms of these basic typeswhich we shall now outline.Abhinavagupta calls each category of practice a 'means to realisation'(updya). This does not imply that there is just one means to realisation"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"172  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONbelonging to each category, but rather that all forms of spiritual disciplineare based on one or other of these principles. Once we have understoodclearly what these principles are, we can identify the categories to whichany given practice belongs. Kashmiri Saivism does not reject any form ofspiritual discipline which genuinely elevates consciousness. It is, in a sense,a science of spirituality which allows for the possibility that any disciplinemay be effective, although some may be more so than others. While nolimit is set on the number of possible means to realisation the yogi mayadopt, he should dedicate himself to the means most proximate to thereality he seeks to know.63 Accordingly, the Master first instructs in thehighest means and then tries lower ones if he fails to liberate his disciple.Thus the first section of the Sivasutra, according to Ksemaraja, deals withthe Divine Means {sambhavopaya), which is the highest of the three.64The second section is concerned with the Empowered Means (saktopaya)and the last with the Individual Means (anavopaya), which is the lowest.Again, although the Malinlvijayatantra defines the lowest means first,when Abhinava quotes from it, he starts from the highest. He also explainsthem individually in this order in separate chapters of his Light of theTantras. Developing in different ways from differing initial states, thethree types of practice lead to corresponding forms of mystical absorption(samavesa) that, although fundamentally identical, are distinguished onthis basis and defined accordingly as follows:The Divine (sambhava) form of mystical absorption is said to bethat which is born of an intense awakening of consciousness [broughtabout by the Master in the disciple]65 free of all thought-constructs.'Empowered' (sdkta) is the name given here to the mysticalabsorption attained by pondering mindfully (cetasa) on reality [directly],unmediated [by other means, be it] the recitation of Mantra (uccara) [oranything else].The absorption attained by the recitation of Mantra, postures of ihebody (karana), meditation, the mystical letters (varna)and the formationof supports (sthanaprakalpana) is rightly called individual' (ariava).bf>Basically, these definitions characterise the three categories ofpractice in the following manner:The Divine Means (Sambhavopaya). This means functions within theundivided realm of Siva's pure consciousness which, free of all thought-constructs, is the universal subject Who contains within Himself allobjectivity. Practising this means the yogi is carried to the supreme levelof consciousness by a powerful and direct awareness of reality awakened"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  173in him by Siva's grace through which he attains identity with Siva withoutresorting to any form of meditation.67The Empowered Means (saktopaya). The practices belonging to thismeans are all internal. They function within the mental sphere (cetas) byreconverting thought (yikalpd) back into the pure consciousness which isits source and essence. Practice here is centred on the flux of perception(pramand) through which the cyclic activity of the powers of the senses andmind merge with the cycle of universal consciousness (samvkcakrd).The Individual Means (anavopaya). This means operates in the ind i vid ualsoul's (anu) sphere of consciousness. Any spiritual discipline whichinvolves the recitation of Mantras, posturing of the body, meditation on aparticular divine or cosmic form and concentration on a fixed point, eitherwithin the body or outside it, belongs to this category. This Means, likethe Empowered Means, is concerned with the purification of thought(vikalpasamskara), which in this case is achieved through thecontemplative absorption that results from a meditative awarenesssustained by objective supports. These, ranging from subtle to gross, maybe centred in the intellect, vital breath and body or external physicalobjects. Included, therefore, in this means are all forms of outer ritual.It is in the sphere of Siva's power that a distinction arises betweenHim as the goal and the means to attain to Him (upeyopdyabhava). It ishere also that Siva freely chooses to create the many means to realisation68as aspects of His power which reveal the freedom of His universalconsciousness. Thus, corresponding to the four basic categories ofpractice, there are four basic aspects of Siva's power. Ranging from thehighest to lowest, these are the powers of bliss, will, knowledge and action.Again, these means operate on the three levels of Siva's universalmanifestation while the fourth means—Anupdya—is transcendental.These levels are the Supreme (para), Middling (pardpard) and Inferior(apara), which correspond to the perception of unity (abhedd), unity-in-diversity (bheddbhedd) and multiplicity (bheda).69 According to Trikadoctrine these levels correspond to those of Siva, Sakti and the individualsoul (nara) respectively.We can also distinguish between types of practice according to themanner in which they develop. Thus, some reach their goal instantlywithout any intervening stages (akrama) through an intense act of will.Other practices develop in parallel with the cognitive processes operatingwithin consciousness which are, as we have seen, explicable only in terms"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"174  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONof a succession of simultaneously experienced metaphysical events. Basedon a direct intuition of reality which, although immediate, maturesprogressively as the factors which obscure it are removed, these practicesare both direct as well as successive (kramdkrama). Finally, there are thosepractices that develop progressively as consciousness unfolds in successivestages (krama). The three categories of practice can be distinguished in thisway because they are each related to different phases in the cognitive cycle.Each act of perception starts with a direct intuition of objectivity in itsmost generic form through the initial awareness the subject has of himself.He then defines his specific object by dividing it off from all others toanalyse it part by part through a series of mental representations of adiscursive order confined to the object previously determined70 by thesubject's direct intuitive awareness. This intuition, independent of thoughtand objectivity71 and hence free of all gradations (tdratamya), is the formof awareness the yogi who practices the Divine Means (sdmbhavopdya)exercises. It is the consciousness of the subject free of all thought-constructs (avikalpa), comparable to the initial certainty we have that twoand two equals four without need of further analysis. Practising theEmpowered Means (saktopaya) the yogi links together the discrete partswith the whole, that is, himself as the subject with his object, through theflux of the means of knowledge (pramdna) which flows between them. Itis like adding two and two together. The Individual Means (dnavopdya)deals with the diversity and relative distinctions between particulars. It islike counting one to four to arrive at the answer we intuited originally.Thus although the means are diverse and correspond to different levels ofconsciousness, this does not affect their ultimate goal.72 By practising anyone of these means we can achieve both liberation and all the yogic powers(siddhi) which issue from the perfection of practice.73 Every means is, fromthis point of view, the supreme means. Abhinava explains:Although the causes may be various, the result, that is, thedestruction, disappearance and removal of impurity (mala) and thepower which determines it, is nevertheless one, just as a jar can bedestroyed [in various ways].74Although the principal categories of practice are three (not countinganupdya), these are again divisible into innumerable secondary varieties tosuit the level of consciousness and capacity of each aspirant. If the yogifails to achieve absorption by practising one means, he must appeal toothers. Thus, for example, while practising the Empowered Means(saktopaya) he may sometimes need to resort to practices belonging to theIndividual Means (driavopdya). Thus, the three means become six if we"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  175add those mediated by others. This number is again multiplied by twoaccording to whether they reach completion or not and again by twoaccording to whether practice is blocked by extrinsic factors or progressessmoothly. The number of means thus becomes twenty-four. As thepossible impediments to progress are countless, the means to overcomethem are equally so; in actual fact there is no end to the number of meansthat may need to be applied by different people in various circumstances.75The means we adopt is not, however, a matter of personal choice. Realityreveals itself to the degree in which ignorance is removed and this, in asense, takes place independently of our efforts. Siva manifests His truenature as He chooses, whether in all its fullness at once, or successively,part by part.76 The yogi, in order to make progress, must be empowered bythe grace of Siva's enlightened consciousness. When permeated by thepower of Siva's grace (Saktipata), the powers of will, knowledge and actionoperating through the means to realisation are directed to a complete andunwavering insight into the true nature of reality. Then the yogi discoversthat the pure knowledge (pramitibhava) of universal consciousnessinwardly manifests as every act of will and each perception, and outwardlyas action. This realisation is consciousness free of all means (anupaya-saifivitti). Although there is nothing more for the yogi to do at this level,the flow of awareness in this state is a sort of means—a 'No-meansmeans'—a 'Pathless Path', to which we now turn our attention.For a tabular arrangement of this material, see table 1.No-Means (Anupaya)It is possible to penetrate into supreme consciousness directly withoutthe mediation of any means.77 In fact, all means ultimately lead to thepractice of 'No-means' for it is the direct experience reality has of itself asthe uninterrupted awareness (aviratdnuttarajnapti)7* the yogi acquireswhen he penetrates into his true nature. 'No practice' is the only practicewhich conforms fully to reality.79 Consciousness is ever revealed; it cannotbe sullied by anything outside it. Nothing can be added or subtracted fromits fullness. Those who are ignorant of this fact fall to the lower levels ofconsciousness and so have to practice.80 When the uninterruptedconsciousness and bliss, the subtle inner nature of all things, aresubmerged below the horizon of awareness by the power of ignorance welose sight of our own authentic identity and experience it as if it weredistant from us, like a goal to be attained.

All the opposites merge andtheir seeming contradiction is resolved. Liberation and bondage becomesynonymous just as the words 'jar* and 'pot' indicate the same object.85No-means (anupdya) is the experience of the absolute (anuttara) beyondboth transcendence and immanence (Siva and Sakti). Undefinable andmysterious, it is neither existent (sat) nor non-existent (asat), neitheris it both nor neither.86Not grounded in anything, this [Light] is not energy, the GreatGoddess; nor is it God, the power-holder, because it is not the foundationof anything. It is not an object of meditation because there is none whomeditates, nor is it he who meditates because there is nothing to meditateon. It is not an object of worship because there is none to worship it, noris it the worshipper because there is nothing to worship.

It is theeternal fullness of consciousness, which is already liberated before we evenbegin to practice (ddimukta). Those who reach this level of practice do notneed to exert themselves at all to grasp reality everywhere constantlypresent.88 Anupdya is the way of bliss (dnandopdya)\\ it is the untroubledrest within one's own nature (svdtmavisranti) experienced when therecognition dawns that it is this which appears as all things. At that instantthe powers of will, knowledge and action merge into the bliss ofconsciousness:In this way, even supreme knowledge, divested of all means, rests inthe power of bliss said to be [the presence] of the absolute here [in everymoment of experience].89"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"178  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONThus there are two levels of Anupaya. At the higher level nothing canbe said about it. It is literally the reality which cannot be described in anyway (anakhya) or approached by any means. To this level belong thoserare, highly spiritual souls who are born fully enlightened and come intothe world to show others the way to attain their liberated state. For themAnupaya literally means that they do not need to practice at all. Mostyogis, however, have to prepare themselves for this state and when they areready achieve instant access to it through the practice of Anupaya as themost subtle means possible (suk$mopaya). The adept whose conscious-ness has been purified and made fully receptive to instruction needs to betaught this practice just once for it to mature in an instant to the fullness ofperfect enlightenment. When the disciple is truly fit to receive theteachings and be liberated,90 all the Master needs to do is to tell him thathe shines by the light of Siva's consciousness and that his true nature is theentire universe.91 Thus:When the Master utters [his instructions] with words intent on thethoughtless, [the disciple] is liberated there and then, and all that remains[of his former state] is the machine [of the body].92When such a disciple sits before his Master, all he has to do is to gazeat him and be aware of his elevated state to feel the fragrance (vasana) ofthe Master's transcendental consciousness extending spontaneouslywithin him. Abhinava explains:So gracious is he that, by transferring his own nature to those whoseconsciousness is pure, they became one with him at his [mere] sight.93If the disciple does not possess the strength of awareness to allow theMaster to infuse this consciousness into him directly in this way while hiseyes are open, he is instructed to close them. The Master then bestowsupon him a vision of former perfected yogis (siddha) while the disciple isin a state of contemplation with his eyes closed (nimllanasamadhi).Through the vision of these perfected yogis (siddhadarsana)94 herecognises their level of consciousness and so experiences it within himself.The disciple's consciousness thus suddenly expands within him like theviolent and rapid spread of poison through the body (bhujarigagaralavat).He thus becomes one with his Master in the unifying bliss of universalconsciousness and so, whether his eyes are open or closed, continues toenjoy the same state constantly.Although it is possible to catch glimpses of the highest reality in"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  179advanced states of contemplation before attaining perfect enlightenment,these states, however long they last, are transitory (kdddcitka) and whenthey end the vision of the absolute ceases with them. The highestrealisation, however, persists in all states of consciousness. It happensonce and need never occur again. A passage from a lost Tantra declares:\"the Self shines forth but once, it is full [of all things] and can nowhere beunmanifest.\"95 All spiritual discipline culminates in this moment ofrealisation. Accordingly, Abhinava stresses that the goal of all the meansto realisation, even the Individual Means, is this absolute consciousness.Finally, it is worth noting that although Abhinava affirms that theteachings concerning Anupaya are found in the Siddhayogesvarimata andthe Malinivijaya, both of which, according to Abhinava, are majorTantras of the Trika school, it is in the theology of the school ofRecognition that it is best exemplified. Abhinava himself refers toSomananda, the founder of this school, as teaching it and alludes to thefollowing passage in the Vision of Siva to support his own exposition:When Siva, Who is everywhere present, is known just once throughthe firm insight born of right knowledge (pramana), the scripture and theMaster's words, no means [to realisation] serves any purpose and evencontemplation (bhavana) [is of no further use].96Anupaya is therefore, according to Abhinavagupta, the recognitionof one's own authentic Siva-nature, which all the higher Tantric traditionsteach is the ultimate realisation. This is also true of the Doctrine ofVibration whose precedents are clearly traceable to these same traditions.Thus, although the Stanzas themselves never refer directly to enlighten-ment as an experience of recognition, there can be little doubt that Spandapractice leads to this same realisation. Accordingly, commentators stressthat we realise the vibration of consciousness by recognising its activityand that liberation depends on the recognition of this as one's ownnature.97 Ksemaraja describes what happens in this moment ofRecognition according to the Doctrine of Vibration thus:At the end of countless rebirths, the yogi's [psycho-physical] activity[which issues from ignorance] is suddenly interrupted by the recognitionof his own transcendent nature, full of a novel and supreme bliss. He islike one struck with awe^nd in this attitude of astonishment (vismaya-mudra) achieves the Great Expansion [of consciousness] (mahavikasa).Thus he, the best of yogis, whose true nature has been revealed [to him] iswell established [at the highest level of consciousness], which he graspsfirmly and his hold upon it never slackens. Thus he is no longer subject to"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"180  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONprofane existence {pravrtti), the abhorrent and continuing round of birthand death, which inspires fear in all living beings, because its cause, hisown impurity, no longer exists.98The Divine Means (Sambhavopaya)In Anupaya the yogi does not need to deal with the world of diversityat all; only Paramasiva exists there. Beyond both immanence andtranscendence, He has nothing to do with the world of practice andrealisation. Anupaya is the experience of the undefinable (andkhya) lightof consciousness, which is the pure bliss beyond even the supreme state(pardtlta) of Sivatattva. At a slightly lower level, corresponding to theDivine Means, a subtle distinction emerges between the goal and the Path.The yogi now practises within the domain of the outpouring of the powerof consciousness. From this level he penetrates directly into the universalegoity of pure consciousness by the subtle exertion (udyamd) of itsfreedom (svdtantrya) and reflective awareness. The yogi who practises theDivine Means is not concerned with any partial aspect of reality butcenters his attention directly on its abounding plenitude. Hence this meansis based on Siva's own state (sdmbhavdvastha) in which only the power offreedom operates as the pure Being (satta) or essence of all the otherpowers. This state is the light of consciousness which, free of all thought-forms, is the basis of all practice.\" The yogi who recognises that pureconsciousness, free of thought-constructs (nirvikalpa), is his basic state,can practice in any way he chooses; even the most common Mantra willlead him directly to the highest state. Thus the forms of contemplativeabsorption, empowered (sdkta) and individual (dnava), that are the fruitsof the other means to realisation both attain maturity in this sameundifferentiated awareness. This awareness is the pure ego manifest at theinitial moment of perception {prdthamikdlocana), when the power of thewill to perceive is activated. It is the subtle state of consciousness thatreveals the presence and nature of its object directly:That which shines and is directly grasped in the first moment ofperception while it is still free of differentiated representations andreflects upon itself is [the basis of the Divine Means] said to be the will.Just as an object appears directly to one whose eyes are open without theintervention of any mental cogitation (anusarpdhana), so, for some, doesSiva's nature.100"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  181The movement of awareness at this level of practice attains its goalquickly. While consciousness is heightened progressively in the otherMeans, here it expands freely to the higher levels, unconfined by anyintruding thought-constructs. The Divine Means is a 'thoughtlessthought', a 'processless process', that occurs at the juncture between Beingand Becoming. Abhinava explains:When the Heart [of consciousness] is pure and [free of thought-constructs], it harbours the light which illumines the radiant, primordialplane (pragrabhumi) together with all the categories of existence. [Theyogi] then realises through it his identity with Siva Who is pureconsciousness.101The yogi must catch the initial moment of awareness (adiparamarsa)just when perception begins^ He must not move on from the first puresensation of the object but return to its original source in his own Tconsciousness. Observing in this way the objective field of consciousnesswithout labouring to distinguish particulars, the yogi penetrates into hisown subjectivity which, vacuous and divested of all outer supports(nirdlamba), is not directed anywhere outside itself (ananyamukha-preksin). Here he can iay hold of the power inherent in his ownconsciousness through which he discerns the true nature of whateverappears before him. Thus the Stanzas on Vibration teach:Just as an object, which is not seen clearly at first even when themind attends to it carefully, becomes later fully evident when observedwith the effort exerted through one's own [inherent] strength (svabala),in the same way, when [the yogi] lays hold of that same power, thenwhatever [he perceives manifests to him] quickly according to its truenature, whatever be its form, locus, time or state.102Thus, although the practice of this Divine Means starts by catchinghold of the will in the first moment of awareness, it also concerns thesecond and third moments in which the means of knowledge and the objectare made manifest. When practice at this level proceeds smoothly andwithout interruption, the three powers of will, knowledge and action fuseinto the Trident (trisula) of power, which is the subject free of allobscuration (niranjand),m at one with the power of action in its mostpowerful and evident form. The Kaula schools call this state the stainless(nirahjanataitvd). Equated in the Spanda tradition with the dawning ofthe vibration of consciousness (spandodaya), it is the enlightenment theSpanda yogi seeks."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"182  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONMany practices taught in the Stanzas on Vibration belong to theDivine Means. Spanda practice is based on the experience of Spandawhich, as we have seen, is defined as the intent (aunmukhya) ofconsciousness, unrestricted to any specific object and hence free ofthought-constructs.104 Spanda can therefore be experienced directly whena powerful intention develops within consciousness, whatever be itsultimate goal or cause. We have already noted that intense anger, joy, griefor confusion are such occasions.105 Similarly, the yogi can make contactwith the omnipotent will, which he as Siva possesses, through intenseprayer. Directing his entire attention to Siva, the Benefactor of the world,entreating Him fervently and without break, his will merges with Siva'suniversal will, which is the source of every impulse and perception. As helooks about him, the yogi realises that it is Siva Himself, the universalconsciousness and the yogi's authentic identity, Who ordains his everyaction, thought and perception. Thus the yogi's cognitive intent on hisobject coincides with the universal will to make that object known to him,whether the yogi be awake or dreaming. He is thus no longer like theworldly man who cannot dream as he wishes and is forced to experiencewhatever spontaneously happens in these states of consciousness.106Ultimately the yogi manages, by Siva's grace, to maintain a constantawareness of his own pure perceptive consciousness (upalabdhrta)divested of all obscuring thought-constructs in deep sleep as well as in thecontemplative state (turlyd) beyond it. When he rises to the higher levelsof contemplation in which the breath is suspended and all sensory andmental activity ceases, the yogi who manages to sustain this pure,undifferentiated awareness does not succumb to sleep as do less developedyogis. Perfection in the practice of the Divine Means thus coincides withthe goal of Spanda practice, namely, a constant, alert attention to theperceiving subjectivity which persists unchanged in every state ofconsciousness both as the perceiver and agent of all that it experiences.Another important Spanda practice belonging to this means isCentering. The Spanda yogi seeks to find the Centre (madhya) betweenone cognition and the next, for it is there that he discovers the expansion{unmesa) of consciousness free of thought-constructs from whence alldifferentiated perceptions (yikalpd) emerge.107 Abhinava explains thatthis pure awareness is called:. . . the expansion (unmesa) of [consciousness] or the creativeintuition (pratibha) [experienced] in the interval which divides two[moments] of differentiated perception (vikalpa). It is here that they ariseand disappear. The Sastras and Agamas proclaim with reasonedargument that it is free of thought-constructs (nirvikalpa) and precedes"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  183all mental representations of any object. None can deny that a gap existsbetween perceptions insofar as two moments of thought are invariablydivided. This [gap] is the undifferentiated unity of all the countlessmanifestations.108Similarly, in the outer more objective sphere, where change consistsof the alterations in the configurations of manifest appearances (abhasa),the transition from one to another corresponds to a phase of pureluminosity that marks the beginning of one form and the end of another.109The world of manifestation and differentiated perceptions (vikalpa) thusextends from one Centre to the next. Although it is never in fact divorcedfrom the subject who resides there, the ignorant fail to grasp this fact andso, cut off from the Centre, the world of objectivity becomes for them thesphere of Maya.110 Bhagavatotpala quotes the Light of Consciousness(Samvitprakasa):This ever pure experience (suddhanubhava) is variegated by eachform [revealed within it]; even so it remains unstained (nirmala) whenmoving to another. Just as a cloth which is naturally white, once dyed,cannot change colour without [first] becoming white again, similarly thepure power of awareness, (citi) once coloured by form, is pure [again] atthe Centre where that form is abandoned and from whence it proceeds toanother.111In his Essence of Vibration (Spandasamdoha), K§emaraja explainsthat the rise and fall of every individual perception in the field of awarenessis a specific pulsation of consciousness. From the point of view of theobject, the expansion (unmesd) of this pulse is represented by the initialdesire to perceive (didfksa) a particular object, while the contracted(nimesa) phase is the withdrawal of attention from the object previouslyperceived. From the point of view of the perceiving subjectivity, the phasesare reversed, so that the initial desire to perceive marks the contraction(nimesa) of subjective consciousness while the falling away of the previousperception is its expansion (unmesd). At the higher level, where these twophases are experienced within consciousness, they represent the state ofthe categories of Isvara ('this universe is me') and Sadasiva ('I am thisuniverse'). Utpaladeva says:Expansion (unme$a), which is in the external manifestation [ofobjectivity], is ISvaratattva while contraction (nimesa), which is in theinternal manifestation [of subjectivity], is Sadasiva.112"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"184  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONAt this level all the powers of consciousness fuse and both phases aremanifest as part of one reality. This unity is in fact apparent to everybodyat each moment. However, within the domain of Maya, which is thesphere of differentiated perceptions (vikalpa), it is clearly manifest only atthe juncture (madhya) between two cognitions.113 In this Centre residesthe void (kha) of consciousness (free of thought-constructs) which,divested of diversity, digests into itself all the psycho-physical processesthat give life to the multiplicity of perceptions. The yogi moves from theparticular vibrations of consciousness at its periphery to the universalthrob of the Heart in the Centre. As Abhinava explains:The self-reflective awareness in the Heart of pure consciousness,present at the beginning and end of each perception, within which theentire universe is dissolved away without residue, is called in thescriptures, the universal vibration of consciousness (samanyaspanda)and is the outpouring (uccalana) [of awareness] within one's ownnature.114All the categories of existence (tattvas) are united in the Heart of theCentre where the life-giving elixir of Siva's consciousness floods one's owninner nature. To reside in the Centre is to abide by the law of totality(gramadharma) in a state which transcends the workings of the mind(unmana).Consciousness (Jnana) with Light as its support, residing in theCentre between being and non-being is known as the act of abiding inone's own abode as the perceiving subjectivity (dra$frtva) free of allobscuration. That which has been purified by pure awareness(suddhavijnana) is called the transcendent (viviktavastu), said to be themode of being (vftti) of the law of totality (gramadharma) through whicheverything is easily attainable.115The power in the Centre (madhyasakti) is the eternal Present. Beyondtime it is the source of both past and future. To be established there is toabide without a break in Rama, the supreme enjoyer, in every action ofone's life.Rama is Siva, the supreme cause Who pervades the fourteen aspectswhich embrace the entire universe of experience, namely, moving,standing, dreaming, waking, the opening and closing of the eyes, running,jumping, exertion, knowledge [born] of the power of the senses, the[three] aspects of the mind, living beings, names and all kinds ofactions.116"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  185By developing an awareness of the Centre, the yogi experiences thebliss of consciousness.117 Through this gap he plunges into introvertedabsorption (nimilanasamadhi) and then emerges again to pervade the fieldof awareness between Centres and so experience the Cosmic Bliss(jagadananda) of the universal vibration of consciousness.118 He thenrecognises that this state pervades every aspect of experience. In this waythe yogi's consciousness is no longer afflicted by the power which obscuresit, hemming the Centre in on both sides with thought-constructs thatseemingly deprive it of its fullness. As he realises directly his pureconscious nature as the universal ego free of all mental representations, itexpands out to embrace all things within itself. Thus the realisation theDivine Means leads to, and is directly based upon, is that this pure ego isin all things just as all things are within it.In the Spanda tradition, as recorded in the Stanzas on Vibration, nosuch ego is recognised.'I9 Man's authentic nature is, however, understoodin personal terms as every individual's own 'own nature' (svasvabhdva)which is Siva, the universal vibration of pure subjectivity (upalabdhfta). Itis not surprising, therefore, that later commentators found these twoconceptions to be essentially the same and accordingly identified one's owninner nature with the pure ego. This came as a natural development inSpanda doctrine not only for this reason but also because the universal egois experienced as the inner dynamics of absolute consciousness. Toconclude our summarial exposition of the Divine Means, which is centredon the direct experience of this pure ego (and hence on Spanda in thisform), we turn now to a brief description of its inner, cyclic activity. Weshall do this by examining Abhinava's esoteric exegesis of the symbolicsignificance of the word 'AHAM', which in Sanskrit means T, andsymbolises by its form the ego's dynamic nature.The objective world of perceptions is, as we have seen, essentially achain of thought-constructs (prapanca) closely linked to one another andwoven into the fabric of diversity (vicitratd). This thought (vikalpa) is aform of speech (vac) uttered internally by the mind (citta), which is itselfan outpouring of consciousness. Consciousness also, in its turn, resoundswith the silent, supreme form of speech (para vac) which is the reflectiveawareness through which it expresses itself to itself. Consequently, thefifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, which are the smallest phonemic unitsinto which speech can be analysed, are symbolic of the principal elementsof the activity of consciousness. Letters come together to generate wordsand words go on to form sentences. In the same way the fifty phases in thecycle of consciousness represent, in the realms of denoted meaning (vdcya),the sum total of its universal activity (kriyd) corresponding to the principalforces (kala) which come together to form the metaphysical categories of"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"186  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONexperience, which in their turn appear in the grossest, most explicitly'articulate' form as the one hundred and eighteen world-systems(bhuvana).'A', the first letter of both AHAM and the Sanskrit alphabet, is thepoint of departure or initial emergence of all the other letters and hencedenotes Anuttara—the absolute. 'Ha', is the final letter of the alphabetand represents the point of completion when ail the letters have emerged.It represents the state in which all the elements of experience, in thedomains of both inner consciousness and outer unconsciousness, are fullydisplayed. It is also the generative, emission (visarga) which, like thebreath, casts the inner into the outer, and draws what is outside inward.The two letters 'A'and 'Ha'thus represent Siva, the transcendental sourceand Sakti, His cosmic outpouring that flows back into Him. Thecombined 'A-Ha' contains within itself all the letters of the alphabet—every phase of consciousness, both transcendental and universal. (For agraphic representation of this analysis, see figure 1.)M, the final letter of AH AM, is written as a dot placed above the letterwhich precedes it. It comes at the end of the vowel series and before theconsonants and so is called 'anusvdra'(lit. 'that which follows the vowels')and also 'bindu'(\\il. 'dot,' 'drop,\"point' or 'zero'). While the consonant'M' symbolises the individual soul (purusa), 'bindu'represents the subtlevibration of T, which is the life force (jlvakala) and essence of the soul'ssubjectivity manifest at the transcendental, supra-mental level(unmana). 12° It is the zero-point in the centre between the series of negativenumbers, in this case the vowels which represent the processes happeninginternally within Siva, and the series of positive numbers—the consonantswhich symbolise the processes happening externally within Sakti.Bindu, as a point without area, symbolises the non-finite nature of thepure awareness (pramitibhava) of AHAM. It is the pivot around whichthe cycle of energies from 'A' to 'Ha' rotates, the Void in the centre fromwhich all the powers emanate and into which they collapse. As such, it isthe supreme power of action which holds subject, object and means ofknowledge together in a potential state in the one Light that shines as allthree121 containing them in its repose122 (visrdnti). Bindu is the 'knower'(jndtr), who is essentially consciousness that, though omniscient, does notmanifest its intelligence, like a man who knows the scriptures but havingno occasion to explain them to others silently bears this knowledge withinhimself. As such, it symbolises the union of Siva and Sakti {sivasakti-mithunapin(ia)m in a state of heightened potency in which they have notyet divided to generate the world of diversity.

The universal potency of all the letters is thuscontained in bindu which, as the reflective awareness of supreme Tconsciousness,125 gives them all life. Thus bindu also marks the beginningof Siva's internal movement back to the undifferentiated absolute and sostands at the threshold of both emission and absorption without beinginvolved in either.The three aspects of AH AM together constitute a movement from theundifferentiated source of transcendental consciousness—'A'—throughthe expansion or emission of its power—4Ha'—to the subject —'NT—which contains and makes manifest the entire universe of experience. Thereverse of this movement, that of withdrawal (samhdra), is represented byM-Ha-A. AHAM and M-Ha-A alternate in the rotation (ghurnana) ofthe reflective awareness of T consciousness as immanent Sakti emergesfrom transcendental Siva to then merge back into Him. As Abhinava says:The universe rests within Sakti and She on the plane of the absolute(anutiara) and this again within Sakti. . . for the universe shines withinconsciousness and [consciousness shines] there [within the universe bythe power of] consciousness. These three poles, forming a couple andmerging, make up the one supreme nature of Bhairava Whose essenceis AHAM126At the microcosmic level, fcA' represents the initial moment when thesubject begins to rise out of himself to view the object. The movementfrom 'A to 4Ha' marks the emergence of sensation within the field ofawareness, which is represented by the fifty letters of the alphabet symbolicof the fifty aspects of the flux of consciousness leading to objectifiedperception. 4M' is the subject who, resting content within himself when hehas perceived his object, merges through the inner flow of awareness intokA\\ the absolute. Then from the absolute (A) its emission (Ha) flows backinto the pure subject (M) set to perceive his object. Thus all the cycles ofcreation and destruction are contained within AHAM through which theyare experienced simultaneously as the spontaneous play of the absolute.The yogi who recognises this recurrent pulse of awareness to be themovement of his own consciousness merges his limited ego with the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  189universal ego. Thus he realises that its power to create, sustain and destroyall things is his own inner strength (svabaia) that he exerts effortlessly inthe same state of mystical absorption (turiya) in universal consciousnessthat the absolute itself enjoys. In this way he shares in the three-foldawareness Siva Himself has of His own nature which Abhinava describesas follows:'I make the universe manifest within myself in the Sky ofConsciousness. I, who am the universe, am its creator!'—this awarenessis the way in which one becomes Bhairava, 'All of manifest creation(SCKJladhvari) is reflected within me, I cause it to persist1—this awarenessis the way in which one becomes the universe. The universe dissolveswithin me. I who am the flame of the [one] great and eternal fire ofconsciousness'—seeing thus one achieves peace.127The experience of the liberated thus coincides with the realisation oftheir own divine nature which, through its power, rules and guides thecosmic order. Thus this attainment (siddhi), which is liberation itself, is inthe DoctrLie of Vibration technically called 'Mastery over the Wheel ofEnergies' (cakresvaratvasiddhi) because the liberated soul, identified withSiva, now governs, as does Siva, the cycle of the powers that bring aboutthe creation and destruction of all things,128The Empowered Means (Saktopaya)All the practices taught in the Stanzas on Vibration are internal.Whenever ritual is mentioned, it is invariably interpreted in terms of thedynamics of the inner processes the yogi experiences and implements inthe course of his yogic practice. The Doctrine of Vibration, Ksemarajaaffirms,129 is concerned entirely with these inner disciplines centred, as it is,in one way or another, on consciousness or, at least, on the inner activity ofthe mind. Thus the Empowered Means which, like the other categories wehave discussed, is entirely internal, includes an important part of Spandapractice. Spanda practice belonging to the Divine Means centres on one'sown inherent nature (svasvabhdva) as Siva, the universal perceiver andagent, that belonging to the Empowered Means on His power. Instead ofarriving directly at the all-embracing emptiness of subjective conscious-ness, the yogi practising the Empowered Means realises his true naturethrough the fullness of its energy. Practising the Divine Means, the yogiplunges, as it were, straight into the fire of consciousness; practising the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"190  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONEmpowered Means he merges with its rays. Either way the yogi is centredequally on ultimate reality. The power of consciousness is no less absolutethan its possessor. To make this point Abhinava quotes the Matanga-tantra:This reality consists of the rays of [Siva's] power and is variously saidto be the abode of the Lord's manifestation . . . That same [power]illumined [by Siva] is itself also luminous, unshaken and unmoving.That very [power] is the supreme state, subtle, omnipresent, the nectar ofimmortality, free of obscuration, peaceful, yearning for pure Being alone(vastumatra) and devoid of beginning and end. Perfectly pure, it is saidto be the body [of ultimate reality].110The yogi concentrates on the powers operating in all of life's activitiesas particular pulsations (visesaspanda) in the universal rhythm(samanyaspanda) of the power of consciousness. In this way he risesprogressively from the particular to the universal until he reaches pureBeing (satta), the greatest of all universals (mahasamanyd) and the highestform of Siva's power. Thus the creative power of Maya, manifest throughcountless lesser powers, no longer causes the yogi to stray from Siva'sconsciousness but becomes the means through which it can be realised131 inthe illuminating brilliance (sphurattd) which is Siva's pure Being. Thus bydiscovering the true nature of Sakti, the yogi realises himself to be Siva,its possessor Who consists of all its countless powers. Thus practisebelonging to this Means leads to the same pure consciousness free ofthought-constructs realised through the Divine Means. Although theultimate realisation is instantaneous, the yogi rises to it gradually byfreeing his consciousness of the limitations imposed upon it by thought.Abhinava explains:The same occurs in the Empowered Means [as does in the Divine].At the discursive level of consciousness (vaikalpikibhumi) [where theEmpowered Means functions] knowledge and action, although evident,are, for the reasons explained previously, contracted. A blazing energy[is revealed within] the one who dedicates himself to removing the burdenof this contraction. [This energy eventually] brings about the innermanifestation {antarabhasa) of pure consciousness he seeks.132Consciousness is individualised and its power of knowledge andaction contracted by the thought-constructs born of ignorance. Thearising of these mental representations, as the Stanzas on Vibration say,deprives the soul of its freedom and immortal life.133 The practise of the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  191Empowered Means is meant to free the fettered soul of this constriction onhis consciousness. It operates within the mental sphere (cetas)m and isdesigned to purify thought (vikalpasamskara) in order to. reveal the pureconsciousness which is its ground and ultimate source. Thus, theEmpowered Means is concerned with the second instant of perception,during which the subject forms mental representations of his object.Thought functions on the basis of an awareness of relative distinctionsbetween specific particulars, distinguishing them from one another andthus seemingly fragmenting the essential unity of reality.135 The vibrantvitality of consciousness, universally manifest, is clouded like a mirror bya child's breath136 and the soul is deprived of the liberating intuition of theone reality free of thought-constructs (nirvikalpa). Abhinava writes:The [fettered soul] is like a dancing girl who although wishing toleave the dancehall is collared by the doorkeeper of thought and thrownback onto the stage of Maya.137All thought is centred on objectivity and hence dislodges awarenessfrom the plenitude of pure subjective consciousness. Thus, to regain theoriginal state of rest (visrdnti) consciousness enjoys, the yogi must ridhimself of thought. As thought-forms decrease, pure, thought-freeawareness is strengthened138 until the yogi is fully established in a state inwhich the relative distinctions (bheda) conceived between entities dissolveaway. Everything appears to him as pure Being (sattdmdtra)l}9 and theentire universe shines before him pervaded by Siva's radiance.140 Hisintuitive faculty (mati) thus purified, the yogi gains both the perfections(siddhi) of yogic practice and liberation (mukti). His consciousness is nowlike a well-polished mirror which reflects everything he desires and grantsit to him.141 Abhinava writes:Just as a man who has been ill for a long time forgets his past paincompletely when he regains his health, absorbed as he is in the ease of hispresent condition, so too those who are grounded in pure awareness freeof thought-constructs are no longer conscious of their previous [fettered]state. Consciousness, the sole truly existent reality, free of thought-constructs is made fully and evidently manifest by eliminating thesedifferentiated perceptions. The wise man should therefore exert himselfto attend closely to this [state of awareness].142The thought-constructs generated within consciousness do not inreality affect it at all. They can neither break up nor add anything to theLight which shines as all things.143 They are in fact nothing but"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"192  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconsciousness itself144 which perceives, through its power of reflectiveawareness (vimarsa), the multitude of objects in diverse ways, and soassumes this form.145 Although thought-constructs are mentalrepresentations of objects once seen or present, they are products of thepower of consciousness and not of the objects they represent.146 Thoughtis both analytic and synthetic;147 it serves the useful purpose of separatingindividual elements of experience from others and linking together thosethat appear to be distinct from one another so that they can be betterunderstood.148 It does not consist merely of false mental constructsprojected onto reality that need to be wholly rejected. Thought obscuresconsciousness and distracts it only when it appears in the form of doubt,vacillating between alternatives.149 Once this conflicting duality(dvaitddhivasa)150 is eliminated, thought is purified and rests in itself as the'thought-less thought' of pure consciousness.151 By gradually eliminatingthe multitude of conflicting notions that agitate him, the yogi ultimatelyachieves the certainty (niscaya) corresponding to a direct awareness of hisown divine nature.152 Abhinava explains:Thought is in reality none other than pure consciousness. Even so,it serves as a means to liberation for the individual soul (anu) only whenit takes the form of certainty (niscaya).15*The yogi must eliminate every doubt and misguided notion that leadshim to believe himself to be other than Siva. By developing the thought:kI am Siva\\ it ultimately affirms itself directly as a pure awareness beyondthought without any intervening mental representations. Abhinava says:Just as the man who thinks intensely that he is a sinner becomessuch, just so one who thinks himself to be Siva, and none other than He,becomes Siva. This certainty (dartfhya), which penetrates and affirmsitself in our thoughts, coincides with an awareness free of thought-constructs engendered by a series of differentiated mental representa-tions, the object of which is our identity with Siva.154As thought is gradually purified, it becomes progressively cleareruntil its object becomes maximally apparent (sphufatama).155 The streamof perceptive consciousness (pramana) progressively reveals each aspectof its object which, thus affirming itself with increasing clarity, reveals itsultimate nature. The yogi reflects repeatedly upon it as the object of hisrealisation and loving devotion, for all that is perceptible and need beknown (jneya) is Siva alone. As Abhinava says:"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  193What should we say of those who before they are satisfied have tosee their beloved again and again, caress her and think about her for along time?156The yogi practising the Empowered Means is initiated into the GreatSacrificial Rite (mahayaga), eternally enacted at the interface between theinner and outer aspects of consciousness, by a direct infusion of awarenessfrom his master who is the embodiment and outer symbol of the yogi'senlightened identity.157 The rite begins with ritual bathing (snana) which isin this case the immersion of the body of thought in the white ashes of thecosmic fuel of duality, burnt in the fire of consciousness.158 The yogi thengoes on to worship (puja) by uniting all that is pleasing to the senses in theoneness of consciousness.159 The ritual formula (mantra) he recites is theeternal resonance of the awareness which is the pulsation of the Heart ofhis own consciousness.16() Repetition (japa) of the formula is every activity,perception, breath or thought which arises within him while plunged in theuniversal awareness of his true nature.161 The mental image he visualisesmeditating (dhyana) on the Deity in the course of the rite, is whatever theyogi spontaneously imagines and contemplates as the outpouring of theuniversal creativity of consciousness.162 Ritual gesture (mudra) iswhatever bodily posture the yogi may assume when, fully absorbed inconsciousness, he moves, staggering about (ghurnita) as it were, drunkwith the wine of self-realisation.163 Oblation is performed by offering withdevotion and awareness all the sensations which flow in through thechannels of the senses to the fire of his subjectivity, which is thus inflamed(uddipita) and makes all things one with itself.164The outer ritual which commences in the sphere of the IndividualMeans thus leads naturally to the inner rite of the Empowered Means.When the yogi's practise (abhyasa) reaches fruition, the rite merges withthe spontaneous activity of consciousness. This is fullness (purnata), thecompletion and reunification of the forces within consciousness which,through the power of ignorance, were formerly dispersed and divided.\"Just as a horse driven here and there\", writes Abhinava, \"overplains, hills and dales follows the will of its rider, so also consciousness,driven by various expedients (bharigi), quiescent or terrific, abandoningduality, becomes Bhairava. Just as by looking repeatedly at one's ownface in a mirror one comes to know that it is the same [as the imagereflected], so also, [one sees] in the mirror of mental representations ofmeditation (clhvana), ritual (puja) and worship (area) one's own Self asBhairava and so quickly identifies with Him. This identification is therealisation that takes place in the absolute (anuttara).\"]6i"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"194  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONBy ridding himself of the relative distinctions engendered by thought,the yogi practising the Empowered Means, illumined by the power of self-awareness of Pure Knowledge (suddhavidya), transcends the distinctionbetween right and wrong, purity and impurity. He is led to the convictionthat the pure consciousness, which is his true nature, is unaffected bywhatever action he may do, whether conventionally accepted as good orbad. Abhinava quotes the Malinlvijaya as saying:All here is enjoined and all prohibited. This alone, O Lord of thegods, is here prescribed as obligatory, namely that the mind be firmlyapplied to the true reality. It matters little how this is achieved. He whosemind is firmly established in [this] reality, even if he eats poison, is as littleaffected by it as are lotus petals by water.166Impurity is a state of seeming separation from consciousness.167 Theyogi who has freed himself of all false notions comes to realise that the truenature of consciousness can never be sullied or limited by any objectappearing within it.168 This is the realisation the ancient sages achievedthrough a direct intuition of reality free of intruding thought-constructs(avikalpabhava), but kept secret in order not to confuse the worldly.169Similarly, in reality nobody is ever bound. It is ignorance to believebondage exists and to contrast it with a conceived state of liberation.170 Ifthe Self is one with Siva, how can it be either bound or released?171Nothing essentially distinguishes those who are bound from those who arefree.172 The difference between their states is merely conceptual.173 Pureconsciousness abides free of all such distinctions. Thus Bhagavatotpala,in his commentary on the Stanzas, repeatedly stresses that thought-constructs obscure consciousness and misguide the individual soul.174Those who are bound are convinced that they are dull witted, conditionedby Karma, sullied by their sin and helplessly impelled to action by somepower beyond their control. He who manages to counter this convictionwith its opposite achieves freedom.175 He who considers himself to be freeis free indeed, while he who thinks himself bound remains so. Thus at thehighest level of realisation, as Abhinava says:Nothing new is achieved nor is that which in reality is unmanifest,revealed- [only] the idea is eradicated that the luminous beingshines not.176Nothing is impure, all is perfect, including Maya and the diversity itengenders. To say that illusion exists and that ignorance must be"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  195eradicated implies that it has a separate existence apart from conscious-ness. If this is so, it has as little reality as the shadow of a shadow, but ifnot,then it must be consciousness itself. Thus, as Kallaja says, bondage,the binder and the bound are in fact one.177 It is Siva Himself Who freelyobscures His own nature. Siva binds Himself by Himself.178 Concealingand revealing Himself, Siva plays His timeless game.At the Divine (sambhava) level of pure Siva-consciousness, theSpanda yogi directly lays hold of the power inherent in his own consciousnature (svabala) which gives life to the psycho-physical organism andimpels the senses and mind to action.179 In this way every thought-construct, and with it the ego, is instantly annulled in the immediacy of thepure subjectivity that remains unaltered throughout every perception andstate of consciousness. The same takes place at the Empowered level b>attending to the recurrent activity—Spanda—of the subject, that is, theflux of awareness through the cyclic movement of the powers ofconsciousness.180 By attending (avadhana) to this movement the thought-constructs that emerge and subside in the course of perception are seen tobe part of this universal process, and, in this way purified, are no longerbinding. Thus, Ksemaraja says that the Spanda teachings are concernedmost directly with the Empowered Means.m The yogi who is always alertto discern the pulse of Spanda quickly realises his own authentic state ofbeing (nijaip bhdvam).™2 He is then truly awake, not only literally, butalso in the deeper sense that he is awake to his authentic nature, its powerand activity. When attention (avadhana) slackens, this movement takesplace unconsciously and so the thought-constructs and perceptionsgenerated through it appear to take on an autonomous existence of theirown, just as happens when we dream.183 The spontaneity of the movementthat travels between subject and object and holds them together in the pureawareness of the universal subject's identity with his cosmic objectdevolves into the creative activity of waking and dreaming. Man, in otherwords, becomes a victim of his states of consciousness and the contentsthat they, by their very nature, generate within themselves.184The Spanda teachings are not only concerned with the structure ofthought and its functions, but also with the powers and properties of itsvehicle, namely, speech. Speech issues out of consciousness, develops intothought to then become articulated sound. A focal point of Spandadoctrine is thus the role speech plays in the formation of thought-constructs and their purification. Although this takes place at all levels ofpractise below the Divine (sdmbhava), the Spanda teachings, meant asthey are for advanced yogis, ignore the outer forms of spiritual disciplineto concentrate on practise in the Empowered (sakta) psychic sphere (cetas)and what lies beyond it where speech is the pure inner awareness (vimarsa)"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"196  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONof the light of consciousness. The Doctrine of Vibration identifies this, thehighest level of speech {para vac), with the universal pulse of consciousnessthat resounds spontaneously within it as the inner flow of its ownundifferentiated awareness.185 Beyond the realms of language, it is thetranscendental consciousness in which all language is rooted and pervadesall that language denotes as its essential being. Utpaladeva writes:The Supreme Voice is consciousness. It is self-awarenessspontaneously arisen, the highest freedom and sovereignty of theSupreme Lord. That pulsing radiance (sphuratta) is pure Being,unqualified by time and space. As the essence [of all things] it is said tobe the Heart of the Supreme Lord.186When the intention arises within consciousness to discern its ownbrilliance manifest in the world of denotations and denoted meanings,speech turns from the supreme transcendental level to that of immanenceand assumes the form of a pure intuitive awareness (pratibha) whichperceives and comprehends its universal manifestation. This is the voiceof intuition (pasyanti), which grasps the meaning inherent inwardly in allwords and externally in all that they denote. Analogous to the non-discursive, instinctual knowledge animals possess, it is a pure genericperception not yet formed into language in which the act of denotation, itsobject and that which denotes it are indistinguishable. Illumined by thevoice of intuition birds migrate in their due seasons, the cock crows atdawn and young mammals suck at the breast.187 Infants similarly reflectand respond instinctively to their environment by virtue of this intuitivesense188 and through it come to grasp the link between words and theobjects they denote. As they learn to speak, they begin to form conceptsand so the next two levels of speech develop. One is the outer corporealspeech (yaikhari) and the other the subtler, inner discourse (antah-satpjalpa) of thought that forms at the intermediate level (madhyama)where the ratiocinating mind stands between the higher levels of intuitionand its outer verbal expression. In this way the development of speech ininfancy reflects its progressive actualisation in every spoken word. Ahymn to the Goddess quoted by Bhagavatotpala describes thisprocess well:Therefore, O Supreme Goddess, the highest form of speech shouldbe worshipped as the [universal] cause that establishes the existence ofall things by insight (niscaya) into their nature (qrtha) brought about bytheir manifestation through the superimposition [of verbal designations].O Mother, insight into the true nature [of things] is nothing but the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  197act of intent of that [same speech], apart from which [speech itself and allthat it expresses] could not attain to its own nature. Again, in that state[speech] is said to be the light of one's own nature. Free of division andsuccession it is attainable [only] by the yogi.Then from the state of intent, O Siva, speech [assumes] the nature ofthought as the radiant pulse (sphuraria) of desire to speak of that which isin the domain of words. Then consisting of words, it bears a clearlyexpressed meaning, for if [speech] were not such, meaning could not beunderstood.189Personal experience clearly proves that thought is invariablyassociated with speech.190 Thought is a function of language. Through itwe communicate to ourselves a mental image of the world about us andcan construct complex ideas about ourselves. Language is the fabric fromwhich our world of ideas is woven. Mental representation which ordersthe influx of sensation and presents us with a meaningful, picture of theworld, memory, the elaboration of ideas and the shifting tides of emotionare all intimately connected with language and through it to theconsciousness which underlies them. To think of language as nothingmore than a system of denotation based on a commonly acceptedconvention (sanketa) fails to fully account for its inherent power to conveymeaning (yacakasakti). In order to learn the convention we must be bornwith an innate ability to grasp meaning, and this ability is not itself learnednor found anywhere within the domain of convention. Lacking this abilitywe would be caught in an infinitely expanding system of denotation inwhich each element pointed to some other within it, without ever comingto rest anywhere. Unless we can couple the word 'jar' with the object itdenotes, explaining that the word 'pot'is a synonym of the word 'jar'wouldleave us none the wiser.191 The connection between word and meaning isonly explicable if we postulate that it is an inherent property of the powerof awareness to link one with the other. Language must be grounded in thepure cognitive awareness (prama) of consciousness which stands beyond,and yet illumines, the sphere of experience we define and understandthrough the medium of language. As Abhinava says:Someone may hear another person speak, but if his awareness(prama) is obscured, he is unable to rise, unconscious as he is, to the levelof the experiencing subject [who understands] what has been said. Heonly grasps the outer successive (sound) of what the other person saysand thus can only repeat it as wou'd a parrot. An understanding of itsmeaning presupposes that he has caught hold of his own power ofawareness (prama) by attaining the autonomy [of the conscious,universal subject].192"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"198  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONOuter, articulate speech consists of a series of ordered phonemicelements produced and combined by the vocal organs to form meaningfulwords. In order for this to be possible, these elements must also begrounded in consciousness (pramd). The articulated phonemes are merelyouter, gross manifestations of the phonemic energies (yarnagrdma) held ina potential state within consciousness. This 'mass of sounds' (sabdardsi) isthe light of consciousness (prakdsa) which makes the universe manifestand contains all things within itself. In other words, it is the totality ofconsciousness expressed as the collective awareness symbolised by all theletters corresponding to the introverted subjectivity of Siva Himself. Thepower through which this potential actualises itself into speech and theworld of denotation is technically called 'Mdtrkd'. It is the reflectiveawareness (vimarsa) and radiance (sphurattd) of the supreme subject—the'mass of sounds' (Sabdardsi)—and the undivided wonder Siva experienceswhen He contemplates the universe He gathers up into Himself in the formof countless words (ydcaka) and their meanings (vdcya).193 Mdtrkdsaktiis manifest in the second movement of consciousness after the primalvibration of the pure luminosity of the 'mass of sounds', as the state of purepotency which arises when its unsullied subjectivity begins to turn awayfrom itself and is associated with faint traces of objectivity (dmrsya-cchdyd).194 Mdtrkd contains within itself the various aspects of objectivitythat, although not yet manifest, are ready to issue forth. Thus this power,at one with Siva, is called * Mdtrkd' because she is the mother {mdtrkd) ofthe universe that she contains within herself as does a pregnant woman herchild, iwThe circle of the powers of Mdtrkd (mdtrkdcakra) consists of thephonemic energies contained in AH AM, the universal ego.196 Whengrasped in its entirety at its source, these energies elevate the consciousnessof the enlightened, but when split up and dispersed give rise to theobscuring forces (kald) which lead the ignorant away from realisation.The fettered soul is ignorant of the pure egoity that is the source of speechand so it generates, through its powers, the many thought-constructs thatdeprive him of the awareness of unity and obscure Siva's universalactivity.197 The Stanzas on Vibration declare:He who is deprived of his power by the forces of obscuration {kald)and a victim of the powers arising from the mass of sounds (sabdardsi) iscalled the fettered soul.198 The powers [of speech] are always ready toobscure his true nature as no mental representation can arise that is notpenetrated by speech.199The rays of phonemic energies emanate from the light of Siva, the"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  199'mass of sounds' (sabdarasi) in eight groups. They constitute the powersof the inner mental organ and the five senses, figuratively arranged in acircle around the sacred shrine (pi(ha) of Matrkasakti who manifestsexternally as the body.200 The eight classes and the names of the deitiespresiding over them are as follows:201GutturalsPalatalsCerebralsDentalsLabialsSemivowelsSibilantsVowelsBrahman!MahegvariKaumarlNarayanlVarahiAindriCamunglaMahalak§m!Intellect (buddhi)Ego (ahankara)Mind (manas)HearingTouchSightTasteSmellThe yogi who grasps the true nature of the power of Matfka and itsphonemic forces is liberated202 by recognising that the activity of the sensesand the discursive representations of the mind are in fact emanations ofuniversal consciousness. Conversely, when ignorant, he is affected by itspower in its multiple negative aspects known as 'Mahaghora' ('greatlyterrible') and, unable to rest within himself free of the sense of diversity, heis constantly disturbed by the flux of extroverted perceptions.203Abhinava explains:When the [phonemic energies] are not known to be [emanations ofthe Lord] they conceal the wonder (camatkara) of consciousness whichis the one essential non-discursive awareness [present throughoutperception] and even in discursive thought. They obscure it withthought-constructs constituted by the diverse configurations ofphonemes and syllables which [although also] a form of the deity [are nolonger benevolent but] most terrible.

But once their true nature is understood correctly in this way,they bestow freedom in this very life This knowledge of their intimatebeing [at one with the absolute] consists of this, namely, that even in themidst of all these fluctuations, free at their inception of discursiverepresentations, thought-constructs do not conjoin [individualisedconsciousness] with the wheel of energies consisting of the totality ofphonemes, even though [these constructs] are coloured by the manydiverse words generated by the aggregate of phonemes.204Language has a powerful effect on us. A few words we may hear orread can inspire us with joy, fear or sadness, and the constant inner"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"200  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONdialogue of thought arouses intense feelings within us. This power hiddenin language, which binds us through the thought-constructs it generates,can also be used to free us of them by channeling it through Mantra.Mantric practice begins at the Individual (artava) level where Mantras arerecited in consonance with the rising and falling away of the breath. In thisway they are charged with the vibration (spanda) of consciousness and, intheir turn, make consciousness vibrate. Serving as a means to concentra-tion, they free the mind of discursive representations.205 The word'Mantra' is thus traditionally said to derive from the words 'manana'and'trdria '. 'Manana 'literally means 'reflection'. In this context it denotes thecontinuous thought or awareness of Mantra which is universal, omniscientconsciousness (visvavijnana). 'Trdriam 'means to 'save' and Mantra 'saves'us by freeing the mind from the bondage of transmigration.206 Mantrasthus serve to generate a higher level of consciousness by a process of'manana' which the texts describe as 'a progressive heightening of thereflective awareness which is the aesthetic rapture that threads througheach state of being'.207 As MaheSvarananda puts it:Reflection {manana) on one's own omnipresent consciousness(nijavibhava) and protection from the fear of one's own limitations is theundefinable intuition (anubhuti) which has absorbed all dualisticthoughts and is the meaning of Mantra.208Although Mantras may convey an intelligible meaning, they are notbound to a convention (sanketa) as is common speech. The 'language' ofMantras is not concerned with external objects. It is language directedinward, deriving its energy from the supreme power of consciousness intowhich it ultimately involutes, transcending the outer and reverting to theinner. The Mantra, like the visualised image of a deity, is a symbol which,precisely because it has no assigned connotation as has the literal sign weuse in propositions, is capable of being understood in more significantways, so that its meanings are fraught with vital and sentient experience.The Mantra opens a new avenue of thought which becomes truer to itselfthan does any other type of thinking which has found its limits in de-vitalised symbols or signs that can be used to signify anything withoutthemselves being significant. \"Mantras are pure,\" writes Rajanaka Rama,\"in the sense that they are not tainted by a conventionally acceptedmeaning (vacya) and transcend the usual form of awareness created byreflection on the phonemes [conjoined to form words].\"209The essence of Mantra is an experience entirely free of objectiverelations. It is the pure power of awareness directed at its own nature andthus free of objectivity and eternal.210 It frees us of the desire to attend to"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  201things temporal by redirecting attention to the heart of consciousnesswhich thus assimilates thought back into itself and stills the agitation(k?obha) occasioned by object-centred awareness.211 In this way the yogirises from the partial perceptions individualised by thought, to theuniversal perception free of thought-constructs. By remembering(smarana) and rightly enunciating the Mantra, he attains a level ofreflective awareness in which all things are experienced as one with his ownnature.212 Thus Mantra has meaning and serves a purpose (artha) to thedegree in which it is possible to intuit through it the power of consciousnesswhich gives it, and all things, being. The outer forms of the Mantra areexpressions of the powers experienced inwardly.213 At root, the Mantrarepresents the pure signification of all possible sentences and wordsrelating to the world of particulars. It enshrines a form of undivided,non-discursive intuition necessarily represented in parts (as the phonemicbody of the Mantra) but whose full significance is transcendental andincludes all possible forms of verbal expression.214 The yogi who repeatshis Mantra undistractedly achieves the power to understand the ultimatesignificance of the formula he is repeating. Thus understood, it awakensin him a state of contemplative absorption at the Empowered (sdkta) levelin which he experiences the pulsing power of consciousness that emitsfrom itself, in progressively grosser stages, thoughts and articulated wordsalong with their meaning. Abhinava writes:A waterwheel moves a series of machines connected to it and canset them into operation by the force of its unified impulse. In the sameway, by the power of the one continuous act of awareness (anusa/pdhdna)which corresponds to the incessant arising of Mantra, the deities of allMantras, at one with them, become automatically (qyatndt)propitious.215The recitation of Mantra starts at the Individual level in consonancewith the movement of the vital breath. To be effective, however, theMantra and its component syllables and words must resonate with theforce of awareness. They must be energised with the pulsation (spanda) ofconsciousness and so penetrate into the absorption of the Empowered levelof practice. At that level the pure thought of the Mantra gradually takesover from the impure and dispersed thought of the world of objects,wrongly perceived to be severed from consciousness and so leads the adeptto the Divine level where the ultimate source of its power resides.216 Thisvitality is Spanda, the universal pulse (sdmdnyaspanda) of awarenessresiding in the heart of consciousness at the supreme level of speech (paravac) as all-embracing T consciousness.217 T consciousness (AHAAf) is"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONthe Great Mantra eternally manifest as the wonder inspired by the light ofconsciousness. The Mantra AHAM which gives life to every living beingcontains all the powers of the letters within itself; giving rise to the entireuniverse, it is present at the very beginning of manifestation where it isestablished in pure consciousness free of time and space.218 Ksemarajaexplains:All-embracing i-ness' (purrtahanta) is the mistress of all the lettersfrom [the first] 'A' to [the last] 'Ksa1 which, as the absolute (anuttara)power of unstruck sound {an&hata), it contains and encapsulates. Thusit is a pure immutable awareness even though it has absorbed into itselfevery cycle of creation and destruction in the play of the Wheel ofEnergies constituting the unfolding cosmic order (?atfadhvari) ofcountless words and all they denote. It is the supreme level of speech, thegreat unspoken Mantra which, eternally manifest, is the life of all beings.Here [in the Spanda school] it is called the vibration of the Lord becauseit unfolds pulsating within one's own being as does the movement of thisdivine universe.219Mantric energy is not to be sought in the actual sound or form of theMantra directly. The ordering of its phonemic constituents (yarria-sannivesa) is merely a channel through which the yogi can tap the energy ofhis own consciousness. The Mantra should be recited with the full force ofawareness. It can only be effective when associated with the adept'sconsciousness.220 The Mantra and the reciter of Mantra must be rooted inthe one conscious reality, otherwise the Mantra can bear no fruit.221 AsRajanaka Rama puts it, Mantras are a mere flux of phonemic sounds,powerless to bend even a blade of grass unless the adept makes contactwith Siva's plane of oneness.222 The imperishable power of awareness heattains thus is the very life of Mantras; without it they are as fruitless asautumn clouds.223 Through this power consciousness emanates andwithdraws the countless Mantras224 to gratify the wishes of each adept andbestow upon him the well-deserved fruits of his practice. Mantras are thusfull of the knowledge and action225 they derive from the Spanda energy ofuniversal consciousness through which they are empowered to performtheir function.226 The vitality of Spanda is the ground of all Mantras. It isthe power by which they emerge from the emptiness of consciousness andare drawn back into it, along with the adept's mind, when they cease toexist as articulate sound.227 They are Siva Himself, one with the universalvibration of consciousness through which they are created and in whichthey lead the yogi to union with Siva. The awakened realise that the powerhidden in Mantras is the vibration of Siva's pure subjectivity (upalabdhfta-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  203matra) which is both the transcendental inner nature of all things and theimmanent awareness that threads through (anusyuta) all the planes ofconsciousness.228 Rajanaka Rama explains:The vitality of Mantra (mahtravirya) is Siva's power, the undividedreality of Mantra and mind (cetas) both when they arise and when theyfall away. It emerges from Siva both as Mantra and as the adept's mind(citta) in the form of phonemes and thought-constructs (sankalpa). TheMantric power manifest [this way] is capable of producing only limited(niyata) results for those yogis who have not come in contact with thepower of their own nature. However, when the yogi achieves a firminsight into his authentic identity, all Mantras can do all things [for him]because he knows how they arise and fall away.229So while Mantra at the Divine level of practice (sdmbhavopdya) is thesilent consciousness of T, at the Empowered and Individual levels it servesas a means to purify thought.230 It leads the adept in stages along the rungsof the ladder of consciousness, ascending which he abandons the lowerstages of conditioned awareness to reach the highest state of §iva-hood,dense with the light of consciousness.231 Thus the supreme form ofMantric energy destroys the obstacles to enlightenment set up by impurethought and5 establishes individual consciousness in the true universalthought of pure Being.232 Filled with this energy Mantras are like rays thatemanate from the all-consuming fire of consciousness, depriving thought-constructs of their essence.233The aesthetic rapture (camatkdra) the yogi experiences increases tothe degree in which the uncreated reality of this pure awareness (pramd)abounds234 and the power of his intuition is heightened as the conventionsof the day to day, spoken language are immersed and absorbed in thesupernal (amdyiya) energy of the phonemes of the Mantra.235 The mind ofthe adept is freed of the constraints imposed upon its attention(abhisarndhyupddhi) and so, free of thought-constructs, merges with thesilence of consciousness together with the Mantra.236 The Stanzas onVibration declare:Seizing that strength (bald). Mantras, endowed with the power ofomniscience, perform their functions, as do the senses of the embodied.It is there alone that they, quiescent and stainless, dissolve along with theadept's mind and so partake of Siva's nature.237At this stage any thought the yogi may conceive is vibrant and full ofenergy because, having thus absorbed all objectivity into itself, his mind is"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"204  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONone with Mantra.238 So although in the beginning individual Mantras mayeffectively correspond to distinct levels of consciousness and stages in thecosmic process, once the yogi has ascended through the planes of powerby merging with the vibration of the Mantras at each level, he emerges intoa state where he enjoys a direct awareness of his own nature. Siva's power,which determines the nature and function of all things, (niyatUakti) istranscended and the yogi's own mind, discovered to be the source andessence of all Mantras, can now implement any one of them to achieveanything he wishes, including liberation.239The Individual Means (Anavopaya)As K§emaraja points out, none of the practices taught in the Stanzason Vibration belong to the Individual Means240 and so it does not, strictlyspeaking, concern Spanda doctrine, if that is, we consider the Stanzas tobe the basic text of the Spanda school.241 From K§emaraja's point of view,however, the third section of the Aphorisms of Siva (Sivasutra), which isboth the last and most extensive, is largely an exposition of this categoryof practice.242 The Stanzas and Aphorisms have been traditionally linkedtogether and so, even though we feel that they should be distinguishedinsofar as the Stanzas rather than the Aphorisms teach the Doctrine ofVibration as such, we are nonetheless justified in referring to theAphorisms as its major source. Our exposition of the Individual Meanswill therefore be largely based on K§emaraja's interpretation of the thirdsection of Aphorisms and we will present it, as he does, as an exposition ofa possible mystical journey of individualised (ariava) consciousness torealisation. We follow K$emaraja because he understood the practisetaught in the Aphorisms in these terms, thereby not only illustrating for ushow it fits into this scheme but also how he understood the basic categoriesof practice and their relationship to one another.According to K§emaraja, the first Aphorism of each section of theSivasutra characterises the condition and nature of the Self at thecorresponding three levels of practice. In other words, they indicate theyogi's basic state at each level in terms of his self-identification. Thisidentification corresponds to his existential condition as a degree of self-realisation in the process leading to the authentic self-awareness of theliberated. The very first Aphorism starts directly with this, the higheststate, by declaring that the Self is pure, dynamic and universalconsciousness (caitanya).243 This is true for the yogi who has awakened tohis authentic nature at the Divine (sambhava) level of being. At the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  205Individual (anava) level, however, the situation has changed. In thissphere of consciousness the intermediate processes of discernment,analysis and classification of perceptions, which bridge the gap in the flowof awareness from the universal subject to a specific object of knowledge,appear to take over the status of the perceiving subjectivity whichunderlies them. The universal Self recedes into the background as a pure,undefinable awareness, and the individual ego, consisting of theperceptions, thoughts and emotions generated by the contact between theuniversal perceiver and the perceived, emerges in the juncture betweenthem. Thus at this level, as the Aphorisms say, the Self is the mind.244 Thisis the Self which moves (atati) from one state of being to another, from onebody to the next carrying with it subtle traces left behind by its sensory andmental activity. Together these are said to constitute, and be caused by,the subtle body technically called the 'City of Eight' (puryasfaka) withwhich consciousness is identified and due to which it is subject to theconstant alterations of pleasure, pain and inertia. The Stanzas teach:[The soul] is bound by the City of Eight {purya$faka) that resides inthe mind, intellect and ego and consists of the arising of the [five] subtleelements [of sensory perception]. He helplessly suffers worldly pleasureand pain (bhoga) which consists of the arising of mental representationsborn of that [City of Eight] and so its existence subjects him totransmigration.245Whereas consciousness itself is the subject who practises the DivineMeans (Sambhavopaya), the subject who practises the Individual Meansis the mind. Unlike the Empowered Means, however, the mind is notdirected inwards onto itself. At the Empowered level, enlivened by thedirect intuition (pratibha) consciousness has of its own nature, mind ceasesto function merely in the paradigmatic, formative manner which gives riseto mental representations, but operates instead as the subtle introvertedactivity of reflective awareness (vimarsa), the power of consciousness(sakti).246 This activity, as we have seen, is the essence of Mantra247 which,independent of the senses, is no longer restricted in any way. At theIndividual lev* , however, the creative powers of consciousness reflectedthrough the eAtroverted mind are greatly attenuated. All that remains isthe power to form thought-constructs and make determined resolutions(sankalpa) which go on to issue through the body into outer action to makethe private creations of the mind apparent to others.248The Individual Means, therefore, deals with the objectively perceivedcontents of consciousness and hence with the individual subject as acomposite aggregate of objective elements, ranging from the subtle life"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"206  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONforce (prdria) to the physical body249 and its outer environment. Thepractices belonging to this Means are thus of two types. One is concernedwith the individual subject who resides in, and as, the psycho-physicalorganism; the other with external reality.250 What this implies essentiallyis that practice at this level is not concerned as much with the will orcognitive consciousness as are the other two Means, but with the power ofaction applied, in the context of the practice taught in the Aphorisms, tothe spiritual activity of Yoga. According to Ksemaraja, the IndividualMeans culminates in the Empowered state and hence leads to the levels ofpractice beyond it.251 This is possible because, despite their differences,there is an essential similarity between them. The aim of both theIndividual and Empowered Means is to purify the discursive representa-tions of differentiated perceptions (vikalpasamskdra)252 and so lead theyogi to the expanded (yikasita) consciousness of the Divine (sdmbhava)state. The other levels of practice therefore both sustain and complementit. The activity of individual consciousness can be fully perfected onlywhen it operates through the flow of the conative and cognitive powerswhich together constitute the pure activity of universal consciousnessbeyond all means (anupdya).In fact, according to Ksemaraja, all three soteriological types functiontogether in various ways, their corresponding states representingdimensions of the same experience. For example, the upsurge ofconsciousness (udyamd) which is the supreme, illuminating intuition(parapralibha) of the Divine state (sdmbhavdvastha)25* is concomitantwith the gathering together of all the powers of consciousness in theEmpowered state.254 The Divine Means, in other words, leads to theexperience of Power (sakti) which in its turn, when fully affirmed, marksthe attainment of a permanent contemplative consciousness (turlydtita) atthe Divine level which persists unaltered in every state of consciousness.Consequently, Ksemaraja concludes his exposition of the first section ofthe Aphorisms which exemplifies, according to him, the Divine Means,by saying:Thus we have explained the first expansion which starts with [theAphorism] 'the Self is pure dynamic consciousness' and expounds thenature of the realisation (prathana) attained through the Divine Means.It is the intuitive insight (samdpatti) of Bhairava's nature which is, as wehave said, the upsurge of consciousness that quells all bondage, namely,the ignorance of that freedom which makes it manifest. Transforming allthings into the nectar of one's own innate bliss, it bestows every yogicaccomplishment (siddhi) including mystic absorption in the vitality ofMantra, the highest of them all. Accordingly, we have, in the course ofthis exposition, explained the nature of Sakti in order to show that the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  207Divine nature (kambhavarupd) possesses [every] power.255Another way in which the Means are related to one another isillustrated by the recurrence of the same Aphorism in different sections ofthe Sivasutra which indicates, according to Ksemaraja, that the samepractice belongs to more than one Means. Both times this happens, theAphorism appears first in the section dealing with the Divine Means andthen recurs in that concerned with the Individual Means.256 In one case,Ksemaraja tells us this is because practice at the Divine level requires noeffort whereas at the Individual level, the yogi must exert himself toachieve the same state that at the Divine level dawns spontaneously.257 Atthe Empowered level also, as the Sivasutra says, 'effort achieves thegoal'.258 Here, however, because as the Empowered Means is, according toKsemaraja, predominantly concerned with the contemplation(anusamdhi) of the vitality of Mantra,259 the effort exerted is that requiredto bring the practice of Mantra to fulfillment. It is, as Ksemaraja says, 'thespontaneous effort exerted to grasp the initial expansion of intention toapply oneself to the contemplation [of Mantra]. It is this exertion whichwins the favour of the gods of Mantra and identifies the adept withthem.'260The second case of the same practice being taught in different sectionsof the Aphorisms concerns the realisation of the Fourth State ofcontemplative consciousness (turiya) in the other three states of waking,dreaming and deep sleep. At the Divine level this takes place by 'violentlydigesting' (hafhapdka) the three states in the Fourth. At the Individuallevel the Fourth state is first experienced at the junctures between the otherthree states and then induced gradually to spread out from these Centresto pervade the other states like oil extending slowly through a piece ofcloth.261 The difference in this case between the level of practice is not onlythat at the Divine level it reaches fulfillment spontaneously, but it is alsosudden and complete, leading directly to the liberated state ofconsciousness Beyond the Fourth (turiydtita)262 At the Individual level,however, practice is gradual and even when the yogi manages to rise tostates of contemplation, he must take care not to fall to lower levels ofconsciousness. Indeed, until the yogi attains the sudden and directrealisation of perfect enlightenment, whatever be his state of consciousnessor level of practice, he is bound to rise and fall because his contemplativestate is necessarily transitory (kaddcitka) however long it may last.The yogi is more prone to these ups and downs the lower his basicstate of consciousness. Consequently, the last section of the Sivasutrarepeatedly instructs the yogi not only how to rise to higher levels of"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"208  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONconsciousness and maintain them, but also in what way he is liable to fallfrom them and how to regain them.263 Ksemaraja stresses that the risefrom one level of consciousness to another is marked by the transitionfrom a lower Means to a higher. Conversely, a fall from the higher level tothe lower entails practice of a lower Means. The measure of the yogi's levelof consciousness, and that which sustains him in it allowing him toprogress further, is his attentiveness (avadhana) to the higher realities heexperiences in the more elevated states. Thus the last Aphorism of thesecond section of the Sivasutra warns the yogi that if his pure awareness(suddhavidya) of his oneness with all things slackens, he will fall from hisawakened state to dream the dream of thought-constructs.264 FromK§emaraja's point of view this means that the negligent yogi must nowresort to the Individual Means described in the next section to return to hisformer, higher Empowered practice in which he experiences thisoneness.265Ksemaraja expounds practice at the Individual level, as he sees it inthe Aphorisms, as extending from one Means to the next. For example,practice at the Individual level diverts the flow of the vital breath (prana)from its more usual course and induces it to enter the Central Channel(susumna) along which it rises as a pure conscious energy (technicallycalled 'kurujalini'). This leads the yogi to the Empowered state in which heenjoys the pure awareness of unity. If he manages to make it truly his ownand it becomes his basic state of being, he enters the Divine plane(sambhavapadd) of identity with Siva.266 The Individual Means is both apoint of departure to higher levels of practice and the level to which theyogi returns if he falls. Thus although the practices taught in the lastsection of the Aphorisms may belong to any one of the three Means, theyare collectively treated as part of the Individual Means because they startfrom it and because it is the yogi's abiding standby if he falls.267Let us turn now to the basic practice at the Individual level, asKsemaraja understands it. This is essentially Yoga. According to theClassical Yoga system taught by Patanjali in the Aphorisms of Yoga(Yogasutra), Yoga is defined as 'the quelling of the fluctuations of themind5 (cittavrttinirodha).2™ The aim is to sever the spiritual essence of thePerson (purusa) from the defiling materiality of Nature (prakrti), eventhough the word 'Yoga'means to 'unite'or 'yoke together.' Here, however,Yoga combines both union and cessation. It is the act (kriya) of removingthe latent traces (yasana) of differentiated perceptions (yikalpa) born ofthe impurities (mala) which contract consciousness.269 This is achieved byuniting all the elements of experience (tattva) together in the wholeness ofthe activity of consciousness. As Jayaratha explains:"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  209The [wise] consider Yoga to be the union of one thing withanother,'270 thus, in accord with this dictum, Yoga is the [act] of uniting[all] the metaphysical principles together within consciousness. . . ,271Ksemaraja seeks initially to establish the best form of Yoga for theyogi to practice at the Individual level. His sources are two Tantras heknew well and considered to be amongst the most important, namely, TheTantra of {Siva's Third) Eye (Netratantra) and The Tantra of theLiberated Bhairava (Svacchandabhairavatantra). The basic model is thatof the Eight-limbed Yoga (asfdriga) taught by Patanjali which consists of:1) The five restraints {yama\\ namely, abstention from violence(ahirpsd), falsehood (satya), dishonesty (asteya), sexual intercourse(brahmacarya) and desire for more than the essential (aparigraha).2122) The five disciplines {niyama), namely, cleanliness (sauca),contentment (santo$a), austerity (tapas\\ study (svddhydya) andreverence for God {Uvaraprariidhdna)2113) Posturing of the body (dsana) in a manner conducive to thepractice of meditation and physical health.2744) Regulation of the breath (prdndydma)2155) Withdrawal of the senses from their objects (pratydhdra)2166) Focusing of attention (dhdrand)2117) Meditation (dhydna), that is, steady, uninterruptedconcentration.2788) Contemplation (samddhi).Ksemaraja rejects Patanjali's system because he believes it to be aform of Yoga that can, at best, lead only to limited yogic attainments(mitasiddhi).219 In the Netratantra, however, Siva teaches a different,higher form of the Eight Limbs of Yoga which lead to perfect penetrationinto the supreme, transcendental principle280 of which the Netratantrasays:Speech cannot express, nor the eye see, the ears hear, or the nosesmell, the tongue taste, the skin touch or the mind conceive that whichis eternal. Free of all colour and flavour, endowed with all colours andflavours, it is beyond the senses and cannot be objectively perceived.O goddess, those yogis who attain it become immortal gods! By greatpractice and supreme dispassion . . . one attains Siva, the supremeimperishable, eternal and unchanging reality.281A necessary preliminary of all Tantric Yoga is a process technically"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"210  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONcalled the 'purification of the elements' (bhutasuddhi), through which thebody is homologized with the macrocosm and so made a fit vessel for thepure, conscious presence of the Deity within it. Ksemaraja equates thiswith the meditation (dhydna) which, according to the Mdlinivijayatantra,characterises the Individual Means.282 In order to practice this meditationthe yogi must visualise the dissolving away of all the forces in the body.283There are two ways in which this can be done. The first is called 'thecontemplation of dissolution' (layabhdvand). Through it the progressivedifferentiation of consciousness from its causal, pre-cosmic form to itsphenomenal manifestation is reversed. As the Vijfidnabhairava teaches:\"One should meditate on the All in the form of the Paths of the world-orders etc. considered in their gross, subtle and supreme forms until, at theend, the mind dissolves away.\"284Mediated by consciousness, the macrocosm rests in the microcosmwhich is emitted along with it successively in the emptiness of theindividual subject, vital breaths, mind, psychic nerves (ndtfi), senses andexternal body.285 The yogi reproduces this process by visualising thetotality of reality including the world-systems, metaphysical principles andcosmic forces along with the Mantras, letters and syllables which representthem, as arising successively throughout the psycho-physical body so as toconstitute it. Deployed in this way they form the Cosmic Path along whichthe yogi ascends, absorbing as he does so, the lower elements into thehigher, thus strengthening and extending his unifying awareness(anusamdhdna) of the configuration of the Path. Thus, moving from thegross elements constituting the outer physical body, to pure sensations(tanmdtra), then to the senses and mind back to their primordial source,the yogi rises from the embodied subjectivity of the waking state to theFourth State (turiya) of contemplation where he is one with the pervasiveintent which initiates the creative vision of consciousness. Abhinavawrites:Once [the yogi] has known [this] Path in its completeness, he mustthen dissolve it into the deities who sustain it and these successively intothe body, breath, mind [and emptiness] as before, and all these into hisown consciousness. Once this is full and an object of constant worship, itdestroys, like the fire at the end of time, the ocean of transmigration.286Thus, the second method K§emaraja teaches to dissolve away thediversity of sensory, mental and physical energies into the unity ofconsciousness is a meditation on the Fire of Consciousness (dahacintd)which the yogi visualises as burning away all division. At the Divine level"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  211(sambhavopaya) the yogi witnesses the sudden and violent withdrawal ofall objectivity into the pure ego (aham), like the pouring of fuel into araging fire.287 He does not need to visualise this process but merely attendto it with a passive, receptive attitude. At the Individual level the yogi mustexert his imagination to induce this process and so rise to the Divine levelthrough the Empowered. The Vijndnabhairava teaches:Visualise the fortress [of your body] burning with the Fire of Time(kalagni) risen from the Abode of Time; then at the end peacemanifests.288The Fire of Time (kalagni) resides underneath the hell worlds at thebottom of the Cosmic Egg (brahmaruja). It issues from Ananta—a formof Siva who presides over the lower regions. He floats on a boat in thecausal waters supporting the Egg, his mind all the while fixed on Bhairava.The flames of the Fire of Time rise up to the hell-worlds heating themintensely289 and radiate its energy throughout the universe. At the end ofeach period of creation the flames rise higher and destroy the old cosmicorder to make room for a new one.290 At the microcosmic level the yogireproduces this process by mentally placing the letters of the alphabet, inthe prescribed order, on the limbs of his body starting from the left toe tothe top of the head. As his attention progresses upwards, he visualises theFire of Time moving with it in such a way that his bodily consciousness,together with the universe of differentiated perceptions, is gradually burntaway leaving in its place the white ashes of the undivided light ofconsciousness.Ksemaraja considers this meditation (dhyand) to be a limb of aprogramme of yogic practice at the Individual level291 of which theremaining limbs are as follows:292Posture (Asana). The yogi fixes his attention on the centre between theinhaled and exhaled breath, absorbing in this way the flux of his awarenessinto the unfolding power of knowledge which rises initially as the upwardflowing breath (uddnaprdna) in the Central Channel (su§umnd) betweenthe other two breaths. The Prank aspect of this flow disappears as itmoves upward and the yogi experiences the spontaneous rise of theomniscience of consciousness within himself. The mind reverts back to itsoriginal, pervasive conscious nature and understands the infinite fact ofSiva's omnipresence. This is the firm seat (dsana) upon which the yogi sitsto practice."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"212  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONRegulation of the Breath (Pranayama). To regulate the movement of thebreath, the yogi must first cleanse the right and left channels of theascending and descending breath by blocking the left nostril while exhalingand the right while inhaling a few times. This ensures that the movement ofthe breath is firm and evenly distributed. Next, without attempting tocontrol it in any way, he attends to the flow of his breathing. As the mindbecomes steadier and in closer harmony with the rhythm of its movement,the duration of each inhalation and exhalation gradually alters until theybecome equal. At this stage they unite and merge in the upward flowingcurrent of vitality in the Central Channel (Susumna). This is when truePranayama begins. The yogi's mind pure and tranquil, he returns, as itwere, to a prenatal state and the external breathing cycle is internalised, sothat it no longer moves through the lungs but passes directly to theuniversal source of vitality. The yogi, now at the Empowered level ofpractice, experiences this movement as travelling from the Heart centreupwards to a point distant twelve fingers above the head where it merges inthe void of consciousness. Free of its outer gross form, the breath movesfreely through the Central Channel and soon transcends even this subtlemovement to become one with the supreme vibration of consciousness. Inthis way, the yogi's breathing becomes one with the spontaneous rise andfall of energy from the bosom of the absolute. Abhinava quotes the Tantraof the Line of Heroes (Viravalitantra) as saying:When, by constantly merging the mind in Siva, Who is the pureconscious nature, the Sun and Moon [of the two breaths] have dissolvedaway and the Sun of Life, which is one's own consciousness, has reachedthe twelve-finger space, this is termed liberation. Breath control [at thisstage] serves no useful purpose. Breath control which merely inflicts painon the body is not to be practised. He who knows this secret is bothhimself liberated and liberates others.293Focusing of Attention (Dharana). Attention is fixed on the psychiccentres in the body corresponding to the five gross elements. In this waythe vital breath is successively directed to these centres from the Heart ofconsciousness to refresh and stimulate their activity. First it moves to theEarth centre in the throat which regulates the firmness of the bones andflesh of the body; then to the Water centre in the glottis responsible for thebalance of the bodily fluids. After this it travels to the navel which is theFire centre dealing with digestion and anabolesis and catabolesis ingeneral. It then moves to the Wind centre in the toe of the left foot whichgoverns the movement of gases to and from the cells via the circulatorysystem. When the yogi has thus achieved control over these forces, the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  213breath rises from the Heart to the top of the head and he becomes masterof the Ether element and so attains every yogic power.294Meditation (Dhyana). The highest form of meditation stills the flux of thequalities (guna) and induces the mind into a state of contemplativeabsorption. The object of this meditation is the supreme and pervasivedivinity of the pure subject whose true nature is known to none but himselfalone (svasatpvedya). The yogi attains him by merging into the constantflow of awareness that streams into the Light which illumines his ownnature.Contemplation (Samadhi). The yogi rises to the level of contemplationwhen the awareness he has of himself and the things around him becomeone and he realises his own identity with Siva, the sole reality.295The aim of this Yoga in all its phases is to achieve the Fourth State ofconsciousness (turiya) beyond the three states of waking, dreaming anddeep sleep and to then ultimately reach the liberated state Beyond theFourth (turiydtita). These five states correspond to: (a) Siva's activity(vydpdra), that is, His power of action; (b) Siva's Lordship (adhipdtya),which is His power of knowledge; (c) the absence of these two, whichcorresponds to Siva's power of will; (d) His exertion (prerakatva), whichcontains all the cycles of creation and destruction and, (e) the rest Sivaenjoys in His own nature, which is His power of consciousness.296 The firstthree states, when divorced from the last two, belong to the sphere oftransmigratory existence. The Fourth and Beyond the Fourth on the otherhand are higher, supramundane (alaukika) states of consciousness inwhich the yogi enjoys bliss and repose (visrdnti) in his own nature bypenetrating (samavesa) into the universal consciousness of the Self,through which he ultimately becomes liberated (jivanmukta). Beyond theFourth is the state of awareness ParamaSiva Himself enjoys when dualityhas entirely disappeared and everything is realised to be one withconsciousness. The Fourth is the state of awareness of the yogi who,catching hold of the pure subjectivity (upalabdhrtd) flowing through thelower three states, is still actively eliminating his sense of duality. Whilethe former is the supreme subject as T consciousness (aham), the latter isthe pure awareness (pramd) or *I-ness' (ahantd) of the subject whichencompasses the lower states, giving them life and uniting themtogether.297 As such, the Fourth State is the reflective awareness of one'sown nature shining in all three states at one with them.298 The fact that werecall that we slept well is proof that this state of consciousness persists"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"214  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONeven in deep sleep. Indeed, if the flow of Turiya could somehow be broughtto a halt, all the other states of consciousness would come to an end in theabsence of the pure subjectivity which makes them, and their contents,manifest.299 The states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep correspond tothe form of awareness consciousness assumes when it it predominantlymanifest as the object, means of knowledge and individual subject,respectively. Turiya is the pure awareness (pramd) that both transcendsthem and merges them all into itself.300 As such, it appears as the triad ofdeed, means and agent in the pure act (yydpdra) of consciousness unsulliedby any outer reality.301 Abhinava explains:(Turiya) transcends the three aspects of 'form', 'sight' and Tconsisting as it does of the pure act of 'seeing'; therefore any means [bywhich this state could be realised] has merely a [provisional] instrumentalvalue. It is, in other words, pure subjectivity of the nature of absolutefreedom, independent of all external means. This is the state ofconsciousness called Turiya, luminous with its own light.302Turiya is thus not just a psychological state but the supreme creativepower (para sakti) of consciousness, the Goddess (samviddevi) Whogenerates and withdraws the entire universe of subject, object and meansof knowledge. In the Heart of Recognition Ksemaraja explains:Whenever the extroverted [conscious] nature rests within itself,external objectivity is withdrawn [and consciousness] is established inthe inner abode of peace which threads through the flux of awareness inevery [externally] emanated [state]. Thus Turiya, the Goddess ofConsciousness, is the union of creation, persistence and destruction. Sheemanates every individual [cycle] of creation and withdraws it. Eternallyfull [of all things] and [yet] void [of diversity] She is both and yet neither,shining radiantly as non-successive [consciousness] alone.303The yogi is fully absorbed in this state of consciousness and takespossession of its power when he is able to rise from contemplation(samddhi) carrying with him the abiding awareness of Turiya throughouthis waking, dreaming and deep sleep. When he achieves this constantly, hecontinues to experience these states individually, but they no longerobscure the insight (pratibhd) he has acquired because he realises that theyare all aspects of the bliss of Turiya. Thus, while the common man callsthis state the 'Fourth' (turiya) because he cannot experience it directly andknows only that it is beyond the other three, the yogi calls it 'Beyond Form'(rupdtita) because it transcends the detachment of the state of deep sleep"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  215which, devoid of objective content, is the naked form' of the individualsubject tending towards the fullness of consciousness. Those who are onthe path of knowledge (jndnin) call it the 'Whole* (pracaya) because, in thisstate, they see the entire universe gathered together in one place.304'Supra-mental Awareness' (manonmana) is the name given to theexperience of Turiya in the waking state. The yogi in this state moves andlives in the world of waking experience free of all disturbing thoughts whileabiding in the transcendental silence beyond the activities of the mind.'Infinite' is the name of the experience of Turiya while dreaming because,free of the limitations imposed upon the body by time and space, the yogienjoys the unlimited expanse of the Self. When Turiya is experienced indeep sleep, the yogi's state is called 'All things* (sarvartha) because in it hediscovers his freedom from limitations in this, the most contracted state ofhuman consciousness. The yogi who manages to maintain Turiya-consciousness comes to experience the three states of waking, dreamingand deep sleep as the constant flow of the bliss of consciousness in which alltraces of the relative distinction between these states and their contents iseradicated.305 Following the stream of Turiya to its highest level (parakatfha), he reaches the state Beyond the Fourth (iuriyatita), which is theuniversal consciousness {caitanya) of the Self. Here the yogi comes to restwithin his own nature. Plunged in the vast, waveless ocean of theconsciousness and bliss (ciddnanda) of the state Beyond the Fourth, theyogi becomes Siva,306 the Free One (svacchanda), and thus wanders freely,practising the Yoga of Freedom.307K§emaraja equates the Fourth State with the pure (suddha), innate(sahaja) knowledge that one's own conscious nature is all things. It is theSupra-mental State (unmana) in which Siva's pervasive presence isexperienced308 once the Yoga practised at the Individual level attainsfruition at the Empowered.309 What the yogi must do, once consciousnessis elevated to grasp the Fourth State, is make it constant. He mustforcefully lay hold of it within himself and not release his grip until itbecomes permanent. Then he travels 'Beyond the Fourth' to enlighten-ment.310 Before this ultimate attainment the yogi inevitably falls. Theforces operating within consciousness that limit and obscure it throw himdown whenever they possibly can. The only way the yogi can defendhimself against them is to maintain a constant attentive awareness of theFourth State.311 He falls when he is distracted but when he attendscarefully to his pure conscious nature, he realises that every aspect of hisstate of being, including the forces that lead him astray, are one with thepulsing flux of his own consciousness and so cannot affect him.These powers, which are the energies of Matrka we have alreadydiscussed, are not the only obstacles the yogi must overcome. He must,"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"216  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONfor example, also resist the temptation to rest content with the miraculousyogic powers (siddhi) he acquires in the course of his spiritual develop-ment. Again to do this he must practice Yoga. Similarly, in order topervade the Fourth State gradually through the other states in the mannerproper to practice at the Individual level, the method is the same. He mustpractise the higher yoga of the Tantras which, turning his mind inwardsand freeing it from discursive representations, allows him to penetrate intothe Supreme Principle.312 Once the yogi has attained this contemplativestate, his main problem is to make it permanent. In the introverted statethe gross external movement of the breath is suspended and with it theactivity of the intellect, mind, individualised consciousness, powers of thesenses and the ego.313 When the yogi rises out of this state, he is liable tofall again into the lower order of creation generated by Maya if he does notmaintain his awareness of the higher reality he has experienced and allowshis awakened, illumined insight to be obscured by the dream-like vision ofthought-constructs.314 Naturally, the yogi must rise out of the introvertedcondition of suspension. It is inherent in the very nature of reality that itshould move out of itself.315 Pure, universal consciousness initiallytransforms itself into the vital breath316 charged with the impressioniyasana) of the power of awareness attained through introversion. Byattending to the pulse (spanda) of the breath as it moves out of theabsolute, the yogi can develop an intuitive sense of the inherent unity of allhe will perceive in the mental and physical spheres created by theoutpouring of consciousness. In this way he realises that his own nature iseverywhere present in all he perceives and that all things thus reside withinhim. Blessed with this insight his consciousness remains free and unlimitedeven at the individual level where the breath, mind, senses and bodyare active.If the yogi fails to do this, he finds himself once again beset by thestrictures of his embodied existence and must, as before, try to pervade allhis other states of consciousness with the aesthetic delight (rasa) andwonder (camatkard) of the Fourth State he experienced in contemplation.Again this means that he must strengthen his pure, empowered awarenessthat his universal nature manifests as all things.317 In this way he discoversSiva's presence in every sphere of individualised consciousness rangingfrom the breath to outer objectivity. The yogi's mind then becomestranquil and undistracted because wherever it may wander, the yogiperceives only Siva, his authentic nature.318 Consciousness is thus freed ofall external referents and the yogi's subjectivity is purified of allidentification with the body or anything else that belongs to the objectivesphere. The yogi then becomes detached from the opposites of pleasureand pain and is transcendentally free (kevalin).319"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Path to Liberation  217The yogi is again, however, liable to fall if he allows himself to getentangled in the play of opposites. This fall is more serious than the othersbecause, although he is caught by the confining restrictions of individual-ised consciousness as before, he is now also affected by karma. Fleeingfrom pain in the pursuit of pleasure he is bound to act (karma) to minimiseone and maximise the other and so is thrown down to the lowest level ofembodied subjectivity (sakala). In order to regain his lost state, he mustascend gradually, by Siva's grace, from one order of subjectivity to thenext and so free himself progressively of the limitations of the lower levelsto gain the greater freedom and expansion of the higher. As he progresses,the objective sphere also evolves from the grossest perceptions of physicalobjects outside the lowest order to subjectivity, through to the subtlerinner, mental perceptions to finally reach the order of subjectivity thatcontains objectivity within itself and is free to externalise it at will.320The degree to which this process develops depends, as before, on theyogi's awareness of the Fourth State. In consonance with the generalprinciple that the remedy should suit the defect, the yogi is instructed toseek this higher state of consciousness in the wonder (camatkara) ordelight (ananda) he feels in moments of intense physical pleasure. At firsthe experiences this subtle consciousness for an instant in the subjectivesphere. If he manages to catch hold of it, it becomes more intense as thecognitive and objective spheres are also gradually pervaded and vitalisedby it. Occasions for this practice are, for example, the sense of satisfactionone feels after a good meal or the aesthetic delight one experiences whenlistening to good music or the pleasure of sexual union with the Tantricconsort or even solitary sexual excitation. In these moments of delight theyogi can penetrate momentarily into his own authentic Siva-nature(sambhavavesa) through the empowered contact (sdktasparsa)nx hemakes with it in the freedom of the pure subjectivity of the Fourth State.322If the yogi develops his awareness of this higher level of consciousness andmaintains it, he eventually experiences it constantly.323Clearly, what prevents the yogi from attending to his state ofconsciousness rather than the circumstances which induce it is the cravingfor pleasure (abhila$a) born of ignorance—the source of every impuritywhich clouds consciousness. Craving directs the yogi's attention towardsouter, worldly things and so he is caught in the net of thought-constructs.324 To free himself of his worldly desires and reverse thisbinding extroversion, the yogi must eradicate its cause. To be freed of allthe ups and downs of the path and no longer be tormented by thepossibility of a fall, the yogi must see reality perfectly and completely.This insight is itself liberation and the moment it dawns the yogi isinstantly freed. This sudden realisation is the goal of Tantric Yoga."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"218  THE DOCTRINE OF VIBRATIONAccordingly the Tantra declares: \"He who perceives reality directly, evenfor the brief moment it takes to blink, is liberated that very instant andnever reborn again.\"325Although the yogi's body and mind continue to function as before,they are like mere outer coverings326 which contain, but do not obscure,the mighty, universal consciousness which operates through them. Theyogi's body is the universe, the senses the energies that vitalise it, his mindMantra, the rhythm of his breath the pulse of time and his inner naturepure, dynamic consciousness. Raised above all practice, and hence allpossibility of falling to lower levels, the yogi realises that he has alwaysbeen free327 and that his journey through the dark land of Maya wasnothing but a dream, a construct of his own imagination."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ABBREVIATIONSA.P.S.

He lived in South India about the middle of the tenth century and wasthe teacher of Ramanuja's teacher. He is credited with having written a work, nowlost, called Authoritativeness of the Kashmiri Agama. This work is said to haveestablished the revealed character (apauruseyatva) of the Ekayana branch of theWhite Yajur Veda which Pancaratrins claim is the original source of their Agamicliterature. (See M. Narasimhacharya, Contributions of Yamuna to Visisfadvaita(Madras: M. Rangacharya Memorial Trust, 1971), p. 12. For Yamuna's date seeibid. pp. 10-11) The origins of the Pancaratra were, therefore, it seems, linked byYamunacarya with the Kashmiri Agamas and the Ekayana. Recently discoveredmaterial confirms that the Ekayana was known in Kashmir before the eleventhcentury. Bhagavatotpala (who probably belongs to the eleventh or tenth century)frequently quotes a work called Samvitprakasa in his commentary on the Stanzason Vibration (Sp.Pra. pp. 85, 87, 89, 95-6, 99, 100 and 112).

It is significant that thisauthor should be quoted so extensively by Bhagavatotpala who was himself aKashmiri Vaisnava Brahmin by descent even though he was a Saivite. It shows theclose affinity between certain forms of Vaisnavism in Kashmir with monisticSaivism. Bhagavatotpala's is the oldest work so far recovered anywhere whichquotes Vai§nava Agamic sources. There can be no doubt, therefore, that Kashmirwas an important centre of Tantric Vaisnavism (the Pancaratra) at a relativelyearly date.6.

The monistic Saivismwe generally indicate by this term was not the only form of Saivism in Kashmir, norwas it entirely confined to Kashmir. Scholars first came to know of the existence ofa distinct form of Saiva theology prevalent in Kashmir when the fourteenth centurywork by Madhavacarya, the Sarvadarsanasamgraha, came out in the BibliothecaIndica series in 1858 edited by Isvaracandra Vidyasagar.

Chatterjee, the first director of the research centre in Srinagarresponsible for the editing and publication of the Kashmir Series of Texts andStudies, in his book Kashmir Shaivaism (Srinagar, 1914), was the first to refer tothe monistic Saivism elaborated by Kashmiri authors from about the middle of theninth century, and preserved in the works later published in the series as 'Kashmir"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Notes   223Shaivaism\\ He did so simply in order to \"distinguish it from the other forms ofShaivaism known and still practised in different parts of India.'* (Ibid., p. 1). Thisterm has since been generally adopted by scholars, even though we nowhere comeacross it in the works of these authors who simply considered themselves to beSaivites expounding Agamic Saivism (Saiva&asana) from a non-dualist standpointwith no emphasis on anything peculiarly Kashmiri about it.13. We suppose that this is so because Tantras of this class are hardly quotedby Kashmiri Saiva authors. Moreover, the passages from Tantras they quoterelating to the Saivagamic canon tend to omit these two groups indicating,possibly, that this tendency was not only confined to Kashmir. Practically the onlyTantra that belongs to these groups that is quoted is the Kriyakalottara (N.T.U.,vol. 2, pp. 148, 151, 157-8 and 196-9). A manuscript of this Tantra is preserved inNepal dated Nepal Saipvat 304, i.e., 1148 A.D. (N.A., no. 3/392). See thecatalogue Brhatsucipatram, Part IV Tantra, vol. 1, compiled by Buddhis&garaSarma, Virapustakalaya, Kathmandu, 1964, pp. 96-8. In the passage quoted fromthe beginning of this Tantra the Goddess asks Karttikeya a number of questions.She says that she has not yet heard the Garmjatantra and would like to do so alongwith the Bhutatantra and Mantravada. She wishes thereby to learn thecharacteristic features of snakes and those of other kindred species such asscorpions. She also wants to know about the planets and their (evil) influencesand about the potentially malevolent spirits such as Yaksas, Raksasas, Pi&acasand Sakinis. Other matters are the evil planetary influences that take possessionof children and trouble pregnant women.14.

According to the first etymology, Bhairava's name is derived from theroots fBhf\\ meaning to sustain and nourish, and 'Ru\\ to shout.19. From the roots 'BhV, 'fear' and 4Av\\ 'protect*.20. From 'Bhi-rava \\ 'a cry (for help born) of the fear of transmigration in thehearts of those who invoke Him'. The form 'Bhairava' thus means 'He who is bornfrom this cry*.21. The word 'Bhairava' is here derived from 'Bha \\ meaning 'star' and the root'//•', to push, impel, or move. Together they form the word 'Bhera 'understood tomean time. The last syllable—' Va '—is interpreted as a derivative of the root 'Vai\\to exhaust. Thus the 'Bheravas' are those who exhaust (vayanti) time, whileBhairava (derived from Bherava) is their inner nature.22. According to his interpretation 'Bhairava' is a compound referring tothose powers 'whose shouting instils fear', while Bhairava is their Lord.23. T.A., 1/96-100a.24.

Similarly in the Buddhist Tantric tradition, time is animportant representation of Emptiness. 'Xla/'is, by coincidence, both an Indo-European root meaning 'time' and a non-Aryan root meaning 'black' or 'darkblue'. For a discussion and references see Myth, Cult and Symbols in SaktaHinduism by Wendell C. Beane (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1977), pp. 81-4.25. For accounts of the mythical origins of the gods we must generallyturn, not to the Tantras, but to the PurSnas and Vedic literature. Although wedo come across mythological material in the Tantras, myths concern them littleand only indirectly. They focus on ritual and all that concerns its execution andultimately its symbolic meaning.

These areas follows: \"Kula is the supreme power.\" \"The nature of the arising and fallingaway (of all things) is consciousness, therefore that is said to be Kula.\" \"Kula ispure consciousness present in the innate nature (svabhdva of all things) and isthe universal cause.\" \"O Best of Women, Kula is subtle, all-pervasive and theagent of all things.\" \"O Goddess, Kula is the Lord of all things, is all thingsand is established in all things. That brilliant energy (tejas) is supremelyterrible ...\" \"Know that Kula, everywhere present, is vitality in the sphere ofpower.\" \"Kula is supreme bliss.\" \"Kula is indeed one's own innate nature\" and\"Kula is said to be the body\".

Chatterjee and others, that Trika is Kashmiri Saivismin toto. In fact, as Pandey rightly remarks, 'Trika' stands for \"the entire Saivathought as presented by (Abhinava) in his Tantraloka.\" (Pandey, p. 295).Even so, although Abhinava certainly contributed enormously to enstatingTrika in the Kashmiri Saiva milieu (and in so doing practically created a Trikasystem of his own), it is clearly an equally exaggerated view to simply ignoreit as a distinct system (as Pandey has done) as it is to identify it wholesale withall of Kashmiri Saivism.40.

This work pretends to dolittle more than present a broad outline of this, as yet, hardly researched area.Hopefully this preliminary study will be followed soon by more extensive workin this field.45. See Pandey p. 491 ff.46. As an example of the close relationship between the Trika and Kulaone can cite Abhinava's treatment of the Kaula element in the Pardtrimsika.This brief tract drawn from the Rudraydmala deals with what Abhinavadefines as the path of Anuttara—the absolute. This path, he asserts, is thatof the Kaulika (See Pandey, p. 46) and indeed the text is so thoroughly couchedin Kaula terminology that some scholars hold the view that it belongs to theKaula tradition (see, for example Dvivedi in L.A.S., vol 2, p. 39). Abhinava,however, calls it the 'Trikasutra' because it expounds in brief the basic principles(prameya) of the Trika system (T.A., 12/15). Again, the text along with Abhi-nava's commentary, is called Anuttaraprakhyd (T.A., VI, p. 249) which remindsus of the name Abhinava gives to Trika, namely Anuttaratrikakula.47. Jayaratha writes:"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"226    NOTESIn this way Trika, the sixth, includes all the dualist and otherscriptures which issue from Is\"a, Varna and Aghora, the SupremeLord's (faces), because it is the abode in which the three goddesses,Para, etc. reside. As the saying goes:Must as scent (pervades a) flower, oil the sesame seed, life the bodyand flavour water, just so Kula is (everywhere) present in all scriptures.'May [Trika] accordingly, flood [all doctrines] with the nectar ofSupreme Unity (paramadvaya) that it may serve as the means torealize the supreme state. (T.A., I, p. 45).We said above (in fn. 39) that it is a wrong to identify Kashmiri Saivismwith Trika as some scholars have done. If they were the same, Trika would haveno independent identity either as an Agamic or Kashmiri Saiva school. Thisis not the case. Let us start with Trika's Agamic identity. Jayaratha quotes apassage which follows a long series of references from the SrikanfhJyasatphitdsuggesting that it is possibly drawn from the same Tantra. This passage states:\"The three powers [reside], in due order, in the [Tantras] of the UpperFace [Isana, i.e., the Siddhanta], the left [i.e., the Vamatantras] andthe right [i.e., the Bhairavatantras]. Starting from the lower to thesupreme, Trika encompasses them all.\" (T.A., I, p. 46)Trika 'contains' all the Tantric teachings in the sense that it was originallyan oral tradition that explained their ultimate purport in Trika terms. Jayarathaconsequently appeals to the authority of the tradition handed down by theTantric masters to support Trika's contentions. In this way he tacitly agreesthat there is no scriptural authority for it. He does, however, stress that Trika isan independent school and quotes (the $rikanfhiya7) accordingly as saying:\"Trika doctrine is in this way dispersed amongst [the scriptures] variously. Itresides in the Master's house because it is handed down by tradition (sampradaya-krama).\" (Ibid).Abhinava himself seems to support the view that Trika is predominantly anoial tradition when he says: \"The teachings of the Lord are divided into ten,eighteen and sixty-four (Tantras) the essence of which are the Trika teachings(Trikasdstra) and of these the Mdlinivijaya. Therefore, at the command of theMaster, we will explain all that is contained here [in these scriptures particularly]that which sages not belonging to any spiritual lineage (sampraddya) have failedto observe.\" (T.A., 1/18-19). Although Abhinava takes the Nialinivijayatantraas the prime authority for his Trika, this Tantra nowhere refers to Trika as anindependent school, much less to itself as a Trikatantra. Even so, it mostcertainly deals with specifically Trika matters, such as the Mantric system centredon the Trika goddesses Para, Parapara and Apara. See R. Gnoli, Luce delleSacre Scritiure {Tantralokd) di Abhinavagupta (Torino: Classici Utet, 1972),pp. 715-30. In the footnotes to his translation of chapter 30 of the T.A. he notesall the parallel passages in the M.V. which deal with the mantras of these goddessesand their consorts."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Notes   227It seems, therefore, that Trika was not originally fully defined in the Agamasas an independent school even when the elements of Trika ritual, etc. had alreadydeveloped. However, there can be no doubt that it did become an independentschool(s) not only in the oral tradition but also in the Agamas prior to Abhinava.We know this from references to Trika in Agamic sources. The Essence of Trika(Trikasara), a lost Tantra predating Abhinava, clearly belonged to this school(S.Su.va., p. 31; for other references to this Tantra see L.A.S., II, pp. 39-40). Butwhatever Trika's identity and character may have been before Abhinava's time,there can be no doubt that he considers it to have had an independent identityboth in the Agamic context and in terms of other Kashmiri Saiva schools.Thus he says: \"Many are the manuals in use in the many and diverse traditions,yet for the rituals of the Anuttaratrika there is not one to be seen.\" (T.A., 1 /14).To make up for this deficiency he wrote his Light of the Tantras.If Trika is not Kashmiri Saivism, then what do we mean when we say thatTrika is 'the culmination of the entire Saivagamic tradition and encompassesit'? We are referring here to an exegetical method which we find exemplified notonly in Abhinava's Trika but also in other Hindu traditions and even outsidethem. Dunuwila, who refers to this same method in the context of the Saiva-siddhanta, describes it as follows: \"What we have here is a structured theologyof Comparative Religion, on the 'gradationist' model, which establishes ahierarchy of systems, the lowest being the furthest away from the truth, and thehighest the most near to it, if not identical with it. This model is common inChristian and Islamic theologies.\" (Dunuwila, p. 47). The higher truth containsthe lower truth, but this does not mean that they have no separate identity. Trikacan be, and is, an independent school although it contains, from its own pointof view, all others.48. Abhinava thus refers to the Bhairavakulatantra as saying: \"The masterwho knows the supreme principle, although consecrated on the path of theVarna (Tantras), needs to be further initiated, first into the Bhairava (Tantras),then into those of Kula, Kaula and (finally) Trika.\" (T.A., comm. 13/302).Again he says that: \"according to the venerable Bhairavakula, only the masterwho has been thoroughly purified by the five initiations and has crossed overthe lower currents (of the Agamas) is established in Trika doctrine.\" (T.A.,VIII, p. 182).49.

Another Jaina writer, Yasahpala (author of the Moharaja-parajaya written in the twelfth century) creates a Kaula in his play who saysthat one should eat meat daily and drink heavily because the religion he teachesallows free scope to one's desires (Ibid., p. 204). This reference proves that thisform of Saivism was known in South India in the twelfth century. Accordingto Somadeva's account of Trikamata practice, the initiate, after eating meatand drinking wine, should worship Siva by offering him wine in the companyof a female partner seated on his lap. The worshipper is to identify himself withSiva and his consort with Parvati (ibid., p. 204). Again, we are told that ayoung prince called Maradatta considered his body to be divine, like one initiatedinto Trika doctrine (ibid. p. 43).64. I.P., 3/2/2.65. Ibid., 3/2/3.66. Ibid., 4/2/2.67. S.Dr., 7/109-123.68. The legendary sage Durvasas is intimately related to Siva accordingto both the Puranas and Agamas. According to the Brahman<fapurana thecircumstances that attended his birth are as follows. Once a quarrel arosebetween Brahma and Siva. Siva became very angry and his appearance becameso frightening that the gods fled in terror. Parvati, his wife, also frightened byhim, exclaimed \"durvasam bhavati me,\" meaning: \"it has become impossiblefor me to live with you!\" Siva realised that his anger was the cause of uselesssuffering and deposited it in the belly of Anusuya from whom was born thesage Durvasas. Durvasas is therefore considered to be an aspect (amsa) ofSiva. (See Vettam Mani, Puranic Encyclopaedia [Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,1954], pp. 256-7 for this and other myths relating to Durvasas). Commonly"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Notes   229portrayed as a devout Saivite in the Puranas, Durvasas is also particularlyassociated with the Saivagamas. According to the Harivamsa, Krsna was taughtthe sixty-four monistic Agamas by Durvasas who is the revealer of them in theKali age (Pandey, p. 63). The Siddhanta also venerates Durvasas and wouldlike to identify him with Amardaka, although he sometimes figures as hispredecessor (Dunuwila, pp. 35, 43).69. The Saivagama, according to Abhinava, is divided into two majorcurrents (pravdha); one originates from LakuliSa, the other from Srikantha.The latter consists of the five streams (srotas) which constitute the majority ofthe Saivagama.

The philosophy of the Siddhanta was right from its inception concernedto establish the validity of our daily experience that the world is real. Accordingly,Sadyojyoti, the earliest SiddhSntin whose works are still extant \"never condemnsperception, inference and the other modes of knowledge as illusory.

This is the a priori basis for any discussionabout its possible nature. Expressing the Siddhanta's view Sivaraman writes:\"But before showing the significant truth about the world's existence in time,it has to be acknowledged that the world is. The world must exist. The mostformal statement we seem capable of making about the 'world' involving aminimum of theory is that the world intelligible to our understanding is quaintelligible an existent, in whatever sense the term 'world' is understood.\"(Ibid., p. 56). The Siddhanta theologian is particularly concerned to prove theexistence of a real world so that he can establish the existence of God Who isits cause (ibid., p. 69).80. Sadyojyoti writes:Now, because the nature of consciousness is experience-as-such(anubhava), it is right to equate it with direct perception. Thereforethe object immediately in front of us in the field of (this pure) experienceis devoid of non-being. One should know this, namely, that there is aclearly evident distinction between consciousness and its object. Theform of the first is experience while the latter is that which is experienced.(Nare&varapariksa, 1/8-9).81. See The Kashmiri Saiva Response to the Buddhist Challenge byDyczkowski, lecture delivered at the Seventh World Buddhist Conference,Bologna, forthcoming.82. In the first section of the Naresvaraparik$a, Sadyojyoti seeks to establishthe existence of the individual soul as both perceiver and agent. His chiefopponent here is the Buddhist. According to Madhusudana Kaula: \"theBuddhists receive a severe thrashing at the hands of our author and are defeatedin their arguments more systematically and more directly than any other school.\"Ibid., Intro., p. 12.83. Sadyojyoti writes: \"Therefore, although an object may change tosome extent, it is perceived to be inherently stable because it is recognised[to be the same at all times].\" Ibid., 1/34. In the absence of recognition, saysSadyojyoti, language would not be possible. If when we hear sounds, we candistinguish and recognise phonemic components within them and link themtogether as words that convey a meaning (again sensed through recognition),we have language.

Pandey does not therefore consider Spanda to be an independentsystem or school in its own right, but rather says that \"the Spandakarika issimply an amplification of the fundamental principles of Saivaism as aphoristicallygiven in the Sivasutra\" (Pandey, p. 155). From another point of view K. C.Pandey sees in the Stanzas mere dogmatic statements of the fundamentalprinciples of what he defines as the Spanda branch of the Pratyabhijna (ibid.,p. 294). All the Kashmiri commentators on the Stanzas, however, consider itto represent an independent tradition, while the South Indian Madhavacaryain his enumeration of the works of the Pratyabhijfia in the Sarvadarsanasamgrahadoes not include Spanda works. Although Pandey is reluctant to concede tothe view that Spanda is an independent branch of Kashmiri Saivism, he doestreat it as such when dealing with the Sivasutra, Spandakarika and theircommentaries.There are evident differences of opinion on this point. Thus J. C. Chatterjeecriticises Biihler for saying that the Spanda- and Pratyabhijna-s*astra are twodifferent systems, insisting that the term 'sdstra' means here simply 'treatise'and not system. He believes that these works all belong to Trika (See KashmirShaivaism, p. 7, fn. 1). Dr. Kaw follows Chatterjee*s classification verbatim.Pt. Madhusudana Kaula also agrees (preface to the I.P.v., I, p. 1). Dvivedimaintains that Spanda is an independent branch of Kashmiri Saivism; however,he identifies Trika with the Pratyabhijna (L.A.S., II, p. 11) and so cannot thinkof Spanda as part of Trika without identifying it with the Pratyabhijna eventhough he does not want to do this. Although it is true that the Spandakarikais by no means as philosophical as the works of the Pratyabhijna and is particularlyconcerned with doctrine rather than argument, it does present its own views anddoctrines in a terminology clearly distinguishable from the Pratyabhijna.93. sivopani§atsamgraharupani s'ivasutrani (S.Su.vi., p. 2): Ksemaraja writesin the concluding verses of his commentary:\"This is a commentary on the Aphorisms of Siva, expounded in orderto penetrate Siva's secret doctrine and beautiful in its agreementwith the scriptures and the Spanda [teachings].

According to Ksemaraja, Siva graced Vasugupta by revealing theAphorisms to him so that the secret tradition might not be lost in a world givenover to dualism (S.Su.vi., p. 1). Similarly, non-dualist Saivism is characterizedby Somananda in his Sivadfsfi as a 'secret doctrine' {rahasyam sastram) indanger of being lost in the Kali age. (S.Dr., p. 220).95.

Each has a different history, a distinct line of teachers, a set of booksin which it is propounded and a different conception of the ultimate reality\"(Pandey, p. 295). The term 'system* is, however, problematic if we analyseKashmir Saiva sources on these lines. It is not really possible to think of theSiddhantagamas, for example, as collectively concerned with a single theologicalstandpoint or with the same ritual programmes in all their details. There areunmistakeable resemblances between Agamas, but the differences are equallynotable. The same is particularly true of the Agamas belonging to the othergroups. Thus, according to Abhinava, it is part of the Saiva teacher's job tofind uniformity and consistency (ekavdkyata) in the scriptures. These Kashmirishave, in their own brilliant way, sought and found such uniformity in the formof the Tantric systems which they have constructed from the raw and disorderedmaterial of the original sources. In this they do nothing new but participate,develop and extend a process apparent in the scriptures themselves.96. S.Dr., 6/9. The other schools of Vedanta Somananda refers to hereare the citrabrahmavddins, who hold that Brahman assumes the diverse formsof the universe of objects, and the ndndtmavddins, who attributed pluralityto the Self (ibid., 6/3). Another school of Vedanta maintained that the Self,or Brahman, is the material cause (upadanarupa) of the universe (ibid., 6/8).There were also the dtmavddins who argued that the Self, that is, the individualsoul, is the absolute, and the netivddins who disagreed with them (ibid., 6/9).The sphulingdtmavddins maintained that individual souls are related to Brahmanas sparks are to a fire. The pratibimbavddins held that the Self is a reflection ofBrahman (ibid., 6/11). One school of Vedanta declared that the Self is differentin different bodies and that plurality (bheda) is inherent in the world, whileanother school maintained that although individual embodied souls do differ,they are in essence one with Brahman, just as waves are one with the sea(ibid., 6/13).97. The discovery of manuscripts of the Light of Consciousness (Samvit-prakds'a) by Vamanadatta (see above fn. 5) has brought to our notice an entirelynew field of research, namely, monistic Kashmiri Vai§navism. There appearsto have been a number of works written by Kashmiri Vai§navas which presentbasic Vaisnava tenets found in the Pancaratra and elsewhere in terms of an^idealistic monism very similar to that of Kashmiri Saivism. Apart from theSamvitprakds'a we know that the Discernment of the Six Attributes {$d(jtgunya-viveka) and the Essence of Ultimate Reality (Paramdrthasdra) were monisticVaisnava works. These and other such works were well known to KashmiriSaivas and influenced them. The quotations from Bhaskara's lost Kaksydstotraclearly show signs of monistic Vaisnava influence (see Sp.Pra., p. 103). Abhinavahimself refers to Vamanadatta with respect as his elder and teacher (or predecessor,T.A., 5/155). Bhagavatotpala's commentary on the Stanzas on Vibration isparticularly important from this point of view. In this work he clearly attemptsan extensive integration of monistic Vai$navism with Spanda doctrine andhence with Kashmiri Saivism. For a fuller treatment of these matters the reader"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Notes   233is referred to the Translations.98. See below chapter 3.99. See Sp.Ka.vi., p. 29.100. Sp.Nir., p. 5.101. It is a notable fact that these terms, so important in the technicalvocabulary of the Pratyabhijna, are not at all common in the Saivagamas,although the concepts they denote are represented there. Consequently, theseterms do not belong to the terminology of the Tantric systems syncretizedinto Kashmiri Saivism, at least as far as we can gather from the sources quotedby these Kashmiri authors themselves. As examples of the uncommon occurrenceof the term 'vimarsa'we can cite the Kdlikula: \"The supreme power of the Lordof the gods Whose nature is supreme consciousness is reflective awareness(vimarsa) endowed with omniscient knowledge\" (quoted in N.T.U., I, p. 21,and also in S.Su.vi., p. 55). Abhinava refers to the Gamatantra which says:\"The deity of mantra is considered to reflective awareness (vimarsa) co-extensivein being with the Great Consciousness.*' (T.A., X., p. 117). These two arevirtually the only references quoted from the Agamas where this term occurs.102. Sv.Up., 6/14 quoted by Bhattananda on p. 51 of his commentary onthe Vijnanabhairava edited by Mukundarama Sastrl K.S.T.S. No. 8 (Bombay:1918).103. I.P., 1/5/11.104. I.P., 1/1/4.105. S.Dr., 1/1.106. Sp.Ka., 28-9.107. Ibid., 10.108. Ibid., 5.109. Utpaladeva writes that \"repose in one's own essential nature (svasva-rupa) is the reflective awareness (vimarsa) that 'I am\"\" (A.P.S., v. 15). Onemight say that Utpaladeva is here explaining, in Pratyabhijna terms, that theSpanda doctrine of 'establishment in one's own essential nature' (svasvarupa-sthiti) implies that this, the liberated condition, is that of the pure ego-identity.110. Pandey says: \"the books, for instance, which include the word'Spanda' in their titles, deal with what is referred to as 'Caitanya' or 'Vimarsa'(consciousness) in the Siva Sutra and Isvara Pratyabhijna Karika respectivelyThey are mere dogmatic statements of the fundamental principles of the Spandabranch of the Pratyabhijna.\" (Pandey, pp. 293-4).111. I.P.v., I, p. 208.112. Sp.Ka.vi., p. 1.113. Thus Dr. Rastogi, for example, in his book The Krama Tantricismof Kashmir discusses the Spanda school because he finds that Spanda doctrineis, like Krama, Sakta. This, he believes, links them vitally together. He says:It has been frequently repeated that the Spanda system is nearest tothe Krama for its unmistakeable emphasis on the dynamic aspect ofreality which technically passes under the name of Sakti or Spandaor Vimarsa.

Although a number of conceptions of the absolute aredistinguishable in Kashmiri Saiva works, we are not concerned here with thesedifferences but will, for our present purpose, treat them collectively as aspectsof a single fundamental concept, the nucleus of which is its dynamic—Spanda—character.18.

Your supreme [trans-cendent] lordship triumphs for it Lords over nothing. Just so is Your lower[immanent] Lordship by virtue of which this universe is not such as it appearsto be.\"28. Ksemaraja, commenting on the verse quoted in the previous footnote,explains that it is not the universe (considered as an independent reality) whichmanifests but God as all the categories of existence. In this sense it is quite real.He quotes Utpaladeva as saying: \"In this way all these physical objects (jatfa)which in themselves are as if unreal are [the forms] of the Light [of the absolute]alone. The Light alone exists, [manifesting] its own nature both as itself andas [everything] else.\" (A.P.S., 13). At Siva's supreme level all that manifestsis Siva alone and so there is no world apart from Him. Siva's lower level ofsovereignty corresponds to the states of Sadasiva and Isvara in which the universeis manifest within consciousness. It does not, therefore, appear as it does nowto the ignorant, to whom it manifests as separate from consciousness (S.St., p. 270).29. T.A., 6/9-10.30. Abhinava writes: \"How can any aspect [of reality] be manifest withinthe Light [of the absolute] if it is not that same Light? If it shines there within it,no duality between them is possible. If it does not, how can one say that ithas any existence iyastuta)! Thus it makes no sense to say that the Light hasany particular form.\" (T.A., 2/20-3).31. S.

We shall discuss the relation between the Stanzas on Vibration andthe Sivasutra in the companion volume of this work.61. The nomenclature of the division into chapters in Sanskrit works ingeneral is very varied and particularly well illustrated in the Tantras and relatedliterature. Thus \"there are Paricchedas \"Sections\", Prakasas \"Rays\", Ullasas"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Notes   257\"Illuminations\", Tarangas \"Waves'*, and many others. A popular principle isthat of adapting the term for \"chapter'* to the title of the whole work. Thus theMantraratnakara and Mantramahodadhi, two \"Oceans of Mantras\" aredivided into \"Waves\", the Sivarcanacandrika \"Moonlight of Siva Worship\"into \"Rays\", the Saubhagyakalpadruma \"Fabulous Tree of Delight\" into'Skandha\\ \"Branches\"; the Bhuvaneivarikalpalata \"Wish-granting Creeper ofBhuvanesvari\" into 'Stabakas'—Bunches of Flowers.\" Teun Goudriaan andSanjukta Gupta, Hindu Tantric and Sakta Literature, A History of IndianLiterature, edited by J. Gonda, vol. 2 fasc. 20 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz,1981), p. 31.62. See footnote 64 below.63. T.A., 4/273.64. We have said that there are four types of means to realisation. Althoughthis is quite true from one point of view, the fourth and ultimate means is notone in the same sense as are the others. Considered to be the highest form ofthe Divine means (sambhavopaya, for which see below), it is the end of all practiceand is accordingly called 'No-means* (anupaya). It is the uninterrupted con-sciousness the absolute has of its own nature (T.A., 2/1) spontaneously andcompletely realised in an instant. Thus 'Anupaya' is the means (upaya) thatconcerns the absolute (anuttara) directly. This means is very important inAbhinavagupta's Trika which aims primarily at the realisation of Anuttara.The reader is referred to P.T.V., pp. 81-4 for the meanings Abhinava attributesto this term (see also Gnoli's translation, pp. 49-50). Abhinava does not quotescripture to define this Means. Possibly Abhinava intends to imply in this waythat, insofar as no practice is involved here, it is essentially undefinable. Forthe same reason it is sometimes not counted amongst the means to realisationwhich are thus reduced to three.65. According to Abhinava the word 4guruna\" can mean either 'by theMaster' or 'intense'. We have put the former meaning in brackets because whatis essential at this level of practice is that consciousness be intensely alert; itdoes not matter whether this takes place spontaneously or is induced.66.

As a result he affirms that Spanda practice belongs predominantlyto the Empowered Means. The energies are aspects of the freedom of conscious-ness which K§emaraja identifies with the supreme goddess of the Krama school.Her Wheel is that of the twelve Kalis who represent phases in the cognitive cycle(described above on p. 124). Abhinava gives pride of piace to the contemplationof this Wheel in his treatment of the Empowered Means in the Tantraloka(verses 4/122b-18 la). Thus Ksemaraja concludes his exposition of the Aphorismwhich declares that \"when the Wheel of Energies is fused into one there followsuniversal destruction\" (S.Su., 1/6) by stating that this practice belongs to theEmpowered Means and is also taught in the first and the last verses of the Stanzason Vibration (S.Su.vi., p. 10). Ksemaraja maintains that because these versesrefer to the Wheel of Energies the Doctrine of Vibration includes the esotericteaching of the Krama school. Thus Ksemaraja says that:"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Notes   261\"In this way the venerable Vasugupta indicates how, through theintroduction and conclusion [of the Stanzas, the Spanda teachings]embrace Krama doctrine (mahartha), and so reveals that this [Spanda],doctrine (sastrd) is supreme amongst all secret Saiva doctrine becauseit is the essence of [Krama].\" (Sp.Nir., p. 74).182.

[When giving rise to the] superior knowledge [of ultimatereality] she is the power called Aghora because she makes manifestboth the inner reality [of undifferentiated consciousness] and theouter reality [of the All] as her own nature. Inferior [knowledge is thedomain of the aspect of matrka] called the power Ghora who directsthe consciousness [of the fettered soul] out of itself when it fails toreflect upon the unity of reality and so obscures its Siva-nature.(Ibid., fn. 9 pp. 8-9).198.

We shall have occasion to discuss the relationship between the Sivasutraand the Spandakarika in our companion volume of Translations. Suffice it to sayhere that even though all commentators connect the two texts in various ways,their relationship is far from clear. Bhaskara thinks that the Stanzas are a partof a commentary on the Aphorisms (S.Su.va., p. 3). Bhagavatotpala consistentlyrefers to the Stanzas as a synopsis (samgrahagrantha) by KallajabhaUa of theessential teachings of the Aphorisms (Sp.Pra., p. 83). Ksemaraja similarly saysin a number of places that the Stanzas convey the secrets of the Aphorisms(Sp.Nir., p. 2). At the same time, however, commentators think of the Stanzasas representing a 'separate system' (svatantradarsana) (Sp.Pra., p. 87) or whatRajanaka Rama calls the philosophy of Spanda* (Spandasiddhanta) (Sp.Ka.vi.,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Notes   263p. 12). K$emaraja, it seems, also implies this when he refers to the Stanzas as'Spandakastra'if we understand 'sdstra'in its broadest sense to mean 'a school ofthought' rather than just a 'book' (S.Su.vi., p. 38;Sp.Nir.,p. 1). It seems, therefore,that although the Stanzas and Aphorisms are closely related, the former marksthe emergence of a distinct school, whereas the latter, although serving as theprinciple source of the Stanzas, does not belong to any particular school. Thishypothesis is supported by the striking absence in the Aphorisms of a numberof the fundamental terms and concepts in the Stanzas. A prime example isthe term Spanda itself, and the teachings concerning the experience of Spandain the first moment of perception when consciousness is in a state of propensity(aunmukhya) to manifestation (see above pp. 92-95).242. S.Su.vi., pp. 35-6.243. S.Su., 1/1: caitanyam atma.244. Ibid., 3/1: cittam atma.245. Sp.Ka., 49-50a.246. T.A., comm. 13/188.247. cittam mantrap: 'the mind is Mantra' (S.Su., 2/1). Bhaskara,commenting on this Aphorism, says: \"One should know the mind itself to beSiva, the subject free of all limitations, endowed with omniscience and everyother divine attribute. Free of the differentiation (kalana) of time and space,its inalienable quality is the experience of its own identity and so, as such, issaid to be Mantra.\" S.Su.va., p. 30.248. Ibid., p. 42.249. Abhinava writes:This Supreme and authentic reality shines also in this, the unreal subject,immersed in the intellect, vital breath and the body because the vitalbreath and the rest are not independent of the Light which is pureconsciousness alone (cinmatra).T.A., 5/7-8a.250. Ibid., 1/164.251. S.Su.vi., pp. 38, 41.252. Abhinava writes:[The state of] individualised consciousness (anu) coincides with themost fully evident manifestation of multiplicity (bheda). The Meansproper to it is therefore called 'Individual'. It consists of representationsand ascertainments of a discursive order [which culminate] ultimatelyin [a pure] undifferentiated awareness.T.A., 1/221.253. S.Su.vi., p. 8.254. Ibid., p. 9.255.

Ibid., p. 12.263. Sivopadhyaya, like Ksemaraja, understands the liberated state asone of permanent contemplation (nityasamadhi). Those who achieve it arenever again disturbed by the emergence of the ego (V.B., p. 64). Taking theVakyasudha, a lost work on Yoga, as his authority, Sivopadhyaya outlinesthe six types of contemplation (samadhi) which lead to it. Sivopadhyayadefines contemplation (samadhi) as 'the subtle state of the mind engenderedby its undivided, non-dual nature* (ibid., p. 99). The first degree of contemplationis discursive (savikalpa) and associated with visible objectivity (drsyasamprkta-samadhi). It is developed by attending to the movement of the mind in momentsof intense excitement or passion. As the Vdkyasudhd says: \"One shouldcontemplate the mind as the witness of passion, etc., capable of being suchbecause it has taken on their likeness.\" The second degree of contemplationis also discursive but associated this time with the Word (sabda) of consciousness.This state is \"pure being, consciousness and bliss. Self-illuminating, free ofduality and worldly ties it is pervaded by the Word 'I am\"'. The third degreeof contemplation is free of thought-constructs. Unlike the previous level ofcontemplation, which can only be attained with much effort, this one dawnsspontaneously when the other two have been achieved. Free of discursivityand objects of perception it is tranquil and steady like the flame of a lamp setin a windless place. The yogi who is absorbed in it relishes the aesthetic delight(rasa) of the glorious powers of his authentic nature. To these three levelscorrespond three others which are their fruits. Thus the first degree of contem-plation frees the yogi from his attachment to name and form and so he participatesin the transcendental freedom of his universal consciousness even while he viewsthe world and acts in it. To the second degree of contemplation correspondsthe uninterrupted reflection (cinta) of the undivided and unique aestheticdelight (akhantfaikarasa) of being, consciousness and bliss. The next degreeof contemplation develops when the mind resumes its original absolute (brahman)nature and savours the aesthetic delight which results from the cessation ofthought-constructs. The highest level of contemplation is permanent andeffortless. It consists of the direct vision (saksatkdra) of reality attained whenthe six degrees of contemplation have matured to perfection. Liberated fromall identification with the body, the yogi realises his Supreme Identity (para-matmari) and so passes freely from one form of contemplation to the otherwherever the mind may happen to wander (V.B., pp. 100-*l).264. S.Su., 2/10.265. S.Su.vi., p. 35.266. Ibid., p. 46.267. Jaideva Singh writes:Such a high state of realisation is not possible by Anavopaya. It isonly possible by Saktopaya.

He was aware that it also distinguished between minoryogic attainments and the higher realisation which they obstruct. Thus hequotes the Aphorisms of Yoga as saying: \"The obstacles which arise in thecourse of contemplation are the yogic attainments (siddhi) gained when oneemerges from it.\" (Y.Su., 3/37 quoted in S.Su.vi., p. 28) He connects thiswith stanza 42 of the Stanzas on Vibration which says:Shortly after, from that [expansion of consciousness] arises thePoint (bindu), from that Sound (nada\\ from that Form (rupa) andfrom that Taste (rasa) which disturb the embodied soul.The Point, etc., represent visions of light, sound, form and taste, respectively.280.
