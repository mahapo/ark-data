Vijnanabhairuva is a very ancient book on Yoga. It studiously eschews mechanical worship, external rites and ceremonies and goes directly to the heart of the problem of the union of human consciousness with the Divine. It describes 112 types of yoga. For this purpose, it makes full use of all the aspects of human life - prana, manas, imagination and intuition. SPANDA-KARIKAS The Divine Creative Pulsation This work elaborates the dynamic side of consciousness and serves as a commentary on the Siva Sutras. According to Saivagama, the Divine Consciousness is not simply cold, inert intellection. It is rather spanda, active, dynamic, throbbing with life, creative pulsation. SIVA SUTRAS The Yoga of Supreme Identity Siva Sutras are considered to be a revealed book of the Yoga: Supreme identity of the individual self with the Divine.

It has been my painful duty to point out a few of the serious mistakes. No one who has not studied this book with a teacher can work away its translation merely with the assistance of a lexicon and grammar.

Preliminary The Saiva religion is perhaps the most ancient faith of the world. Sir John Marshall says in his Mohenjodaro and the Indus Civilization that excavations in Mohenjodaro and Harappa reveal an important fact, viz., that Sivaism has a history going back to the Chalcolithic Age or even further still, and that it thus takes its place as the most ancient living faith in the world. It had many off-shoots and appeared in different forms in many parts of the world. In India, there are three main forms of this religio-philosophy, viz., the Vira-Saiva form in Deccan-Kamataka, the Saiva-siddhanta in Tamila Nadu, and the Advaita Saiva form in Kashmir. There are some common features in all the three, but there are important differences also. Here we are concerned with the Advaita Saiva Philosophy of Kashmir. In India, there is no such thing as arm-chair philosophy. Philosophy is not only a way of thought, but also a way of life in this country. It is not born of idle curiosity, nor is it a mere intellectual game. Every philosophy here is a religion, and every religion has its philosophy. The philosopher here was not a tall and spectacled professor dictating his notes to the class or weaving cob-webs of theory in his study, but one who was moved by a deep inner urge to know the secrets of life, who lived laborious days of spiritual discipline and who saw the light by the transformation of his life. Moved by pity for his fellow-men, he tried to interpret the truth he had experienced to the logical reason of man. Thus arose philo­sophy in this country. The Advaita Saiva Philosophy of Kashmir was of this type. For centuries, it was imparted as a secret doctrine to the aspirant who had to live it and test it in the laboratory of the Self. In course of time only the cult and the ritual remained; the philosophical background was forgotten. Perhaps, a select few still knew the philosophical doctrine by oral tradition,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 Pratyabhijnahrdayam but the first thinker known to history, who reduced the main principles to writing was, Vasugupta. He is said to have lived towards the end of the eighth or the beginning of the ninth century A.D. Since then, philosophical writing had been an active and continued process in Kashmir which went on for nearly four centuries. The literature on this system has accumulated to such an extent that it would require almost a life-time to study it. Some works of the system have still not been published. Saiva Literature The literature of the Saiva or Trika system may be broadly divided into three: (a) Agama Sastra, (b) Spanda Sastra, (c) Pratyabhijna Sastra. (a) Agama Sastra This is believed to be a revelation and has been handed down from teacher to pupil. Some of the works under this heading are: Malinivijaya, Svacchanda, Vijnanabhairava, Mrgendra, Rudra-yamala, Siva-Sutras. On the Siva-Sutras there are the Vrtti, the Varttika of Bhaskara and Varadaraja and the Vimarsini commentary by Ksemaraja. There are commentaries on some of the tantras also. (b) Spanda Sastra This lays down the important doctrines of the system. The main works under this heading are : The Spanda Sutras or the Spanda Karikas. These elaborate the principles of the Siva-Sutras. On these, there are the following commentaries : Vivrti by Ramakantha, Pradipika by Utpala Vaisnava, Spandasandoha by Ksemaraja, and Spandanirnaya by Ksemaraja. Spandasandoha contains a commentary only on the first Karika."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction    3    (c) Pratyabhijna Sastra This contains arguments and countet-arguments, discus­sions, and reasonings. This interprets the main doctrines of the system to the logical reason of man. Somananda composed Sivadrsti. Another important work is Isvarapratyabhijna by Utpala, pupil of Somananda. There are the following commentaries on this : Vrtti by the author himself, Pratyabhijnavimarsini and Pratya-bhijna-vivrti-vimarsini by Abhinavagupta. A digest of the Pratyabhijna Sastra, named Pratyabhijna-hrdayam was prepared by Ksemaraja. Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka in 12 Volumes and his Tantralokasara give an exhaustive treatment of all the impor­tant doctrines and disciplines of the system.1 Pratyabhijndhrdayam As said above, this is a digest of the Pratyabhijna system prepared by Ksemaraja. He was the brilliant pupil of Abhinavagupta, a versatile genius who was a peerless master of tantra, yoga, philosophy, poetics, and dramaturgy. Accord­ing to Dr. K.G. Pandey, Abhinavagupta flourished in the tenth century A.D. Since Ksemaraja was his pupil, he must have also lived in the tenth century. He wrote the following works : Pratyabhijndhrdayam, Spandasandoha, Spandanirnaya, Svacchan-dodyota, Netrodyota, Vijnanadhairavodyota, Sivasutra-vimar-sini, Stavacintamanitika, Parapravesika, Tattvasandoha. Very little is known of the life and parentage of Ksemaraja. It has been very rightly said that his book, Pratyabhijnahrdayam occupies the same place in Saiva or Trika literature as Vedantasara does in Vedanta. It avoids all polemics ana gives in a very succinct form the main tenets of the Pratyabhi­jna system. He says at the very outset of his work : 1. I am indebted to J.C. Chatterji's Kashmir Shaivism for the historical account given above."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 Pratyabhijnahrdayam \"In this world, there are some devoted people who are undeveloped in reflection and have not taken pains in study­ing difficult works (like Logic and Dialectics), but who never­theless aspire after Samavesa with the Highest Lord which blossoms forth with the descent of Sakti. For their sake the truth of the teachings of ISvarapratyabhijna is being explain­ed briefly.\" He regarded Isvarapratyabhijna of Utpalacarya as a very great work on this system, and has provided a ready and easy manual for those who are inclined as a result of Divine grace to know the main principles of 'pratyabhijna', but are unable to study the great work of Utpalacarya, because of their lack of training in Logic and Dialectics. He has succeed­ed remarkably well in condensing in a short compass all the important principles of Isvarapratyabhijna and has avoided its rigoristic logical discussion. The book is, therefore, of supreme importance for those who want to have an elemen­tary knowledge of 'pratyabhijna'. He has composed the Sutras as well as written the commentary. The word 'pratyabhijna' means re-cognition. The indivi­dual Self or jiva is divine or Siva, but he has forgotten his real nature, and is identified with his psycho-physical mechanism. The teaching is meant to enable him to recognise his real nature, to bring home to him the truth that his real Self is none other than Siva and to suggest to him the spiri­tual discipline by which he can attain 'at-one-ment' with Him. The details of the teaching will be found in the body of the book. Here we may review the main ideas of the system under the following heads: 1. Ultimate Reality 2. The Universe or the World Process. 3. Svatantryavada and Abhasavada 4. Sadadhva 5. Com­parison and Contrast with Samkara's Advaitavada 6. The Individual Self 7. Bondage 8. Liberation. 1. Ultimate Reality Reality in its ultimate aspect is Cit or Parasamvit. Cit or Parasamvit is untranslatable in any other language. Generally it is translated 'consciousness'. I have myself done so for want"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 of a better word. But it should be clearly understood that Cit is not exactly consciousness. The word Con-sciousness connotes subject-object relation, knower-known duality. But Cit is not relational. It is just the changeless principle of all changing experience. It is Parasarhvit. It has, so to speak, the immediacy of feeling where neither the 'I', nor the 'This' is distinguished. It is the 'coalescence into undivided unity'of 'I' and 'This'. Perhaps, the word 'sciousness' may, to some extent, express the idea contained in Git or Parasamvit. To use the verb contained in consciousness, the Ultimate Reality or Supreme Self is the Self Sciring Itself. In the words of Pratyabhijna Sastra, it is, prakasavimarsamaya. The Supreme Self is called Parama Siva. This is not only prakasa. The word 'prakasa' again is untranslatable. Literally, it means light, illumination. Just as light makes every thing visible, even so that being there, every thing else is. In the words of Kathopanisad - 'Tameva bhantam anubhati sarvam, tasya bhasa sarvamidam vibhati'. 'It shining, every thing happens to shine. By its light alone does all this appear.' Sankara Vedanta also calls Ultimate Reality 'prakasa', but the sun is 'prakasa; even a diamond is 'prakasa'. What is the difference between the two? The Saiva philosophy says, \"Ultimate Reality is not simply prakasa: it is also vimarsa\". What is this vimarsa? This word again is untranslatable. Perhaps the word 'Sciring' may help. Ultimate Reality is not only Sciousness (prakasa), but a Sciousness that also scires itself (vimarsa). It is not simply prakasa lying inert like a diamond, but surveys itself. This Sciring or Surveying of itself by Ultimate Reality is called Vimarsa. As Ksemaraja has put it in his Parapravesika (p.2) it is \"akrtrimaham iti visphura-nam\"; it is the non-relational, immediate awareness of I. What this 'akrtrima-aham' is, we shall see later on. If Ultimate Reality were merely prakasa and not also vimarsa, it would be powerless and inert. \"Yadi nirvimarsah syat anisvaro jadasca prasajyeta\" [Parapravesika, p. 2) It is this pure I-consciousness or Vimarsa that is responsible for the manifestation, maintenance and reabsorption of the universe. Git scires itself as Cidrupini Sakti. This sciring itself as Cidrupini Sakti is Vimarsa. Therefore, vimarsa has been named"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 Pratyabhijndhrdayam differently as parasakti, paravak, Svatantrya, aisvarya, kartrtva, sphuratta, Sara, hrdaya, Spanda. (See Parapravesika p. 2) It will thus be seen that the Ultimate Reality is not only Universal Consciousness but also Universal Psychic Energy or Power. This All-inclusive Universal Consciousness is also call­ed Anuttara i.e., the Reality than which there is nothing that may be called higher - the Highest Reality, the Absolute. It is both transcendental (visvottirna) and immanent (visvmaya). The Saiva philosophy has been called Realistic Idealism by some writers. I do not think this is a happy characterization of the Saiva philosophy. The approach of the Idealists of the West is entirely different from that of the thinkers of the Saiva philosophy. To characterize it in terms of the Western Idealists is only to create confusion. The word 'idea' has played havoc in Western philosophy, and it would not be right to import that havoc in Saiva philosophy. Ultimate Reality is not a mere 'idea' whatever that may mean, but Self underlying all reality, the Changeless Principle of all manifestation. 2. Manifestation - the Universe - or the World Process Whether we call Ultimate Reality Sciousness or Conscious­ness, it is not something blank. It has infinite powers, and contains in a potential form all that is ever likely to be. It is the Svabhava or nature of Ultimate Reality to manifest. If Ultimate Reality did not manifest, it would no longer be consciousness or Self, but something like an object or not-Self. As Abhinavagupta puts it: - Tantr. III. 100 \"If the Highest Reality did not manifest in infinite variety, but remained cooped up within its solid singleness, it would neither be the Highest Power nor Consciousness, but something like a jar\". We have seen that Ultimate Reality or Parama Siva is 'prakasa-vimars'amaya In that state the 'I' and the 'This' are in an undivided unity. The 'V is the 'prakasa' aspect, and the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 'This'or Its consciousness of It as itself is the 'vimarsa'aspect. This Vimarsa is Svatantrya, Absolute will or Sakti. This Sakti has been called as 'the Heart of the Supreme Lord' in Parapra-vetika by Ksemaraja (hrdayam paramesituh). But Sakti is only another aspect of the Supreme Self. In the Supreme experience, the so-called 'This' is nothing but the Self. There is one Self experiencing Itself. This Vimarsa or Sakti is not contentless. It contains all that is to be. - Paratrimsika 24 \"As the great banyan tree lies only in the form of potency in the seed, even so the entire universe with all the mobile and immobile beings lies as a potency in the heart of the Supreme\". Another example that is usually given is that of the peacock. Just as a peacock with all its variegated plumage lies as a mere potency in the plasma of its egg, even so the entire universe lies in the Sakti of the Supreme. The Sakti of the Supreme is called Citi or para-Sakti or para-vak. Parama Siva has infinite Sakti, but the following five may be considered to be the main ones: 1. Cit - the power of Self-revelation by which the Supreme shines by Himself. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Siva. 2. Ananda - This is absolute bliss. This is also called Svatantrya - absolute Will which is able to do anything with­out any extraneous aid. (Svatantryam anandasaktih : Tantra-sara-Ahn. 1). In this aspect, the Supreme is known as Sakti. In a sense Cit and ananda are the very svarupa (nature) of the Supreme. The rest may be called His Saktis. 3. Iccha - the Will to do this or that, to create. In this aspect, He is known as Sadasiva or Sadakhya. 4. Jnana - the power of knowing. In this aspect, He is known as ISvara. 5. Kriya - the power of assuming any and every form (Sarvakarayogitvam Kriyasaktih : Tantrasara Ahn. l).In this aspect, He is known as Sadvidya or Suddha Vidya."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 Pratyabhijnahrdayam The Universe is nothing but an opening out (unmesa) or expansion (prasara) of the Supreme or rather of the Supreme as Sakti. I. The Tattvas of the Universal Experience: 1-5 We have seen that Parama Siva has two aspects, viz., transcendental (visvottirna) and immanent or creative (visva-maya). This creative aspect of Parama Siva is called Siva tattva. (1) Siva tattva* is the initial creative movement (prathama spanda) of Parama Siva. As has been said in Sattrimsat-tattva-sandoha: - verse 1 When Anuttara or The Absolute by His Svatantrya or Abso­lute Will feels like letting go the Universe contained in Him, the first vibration or throb of this Will is known as Siva. (2) Sakti tattva is the Energy of Siva. Sakti in her jnana aspect is the principle of negation (nisedha-vyapara-rupa). Sakti, at first, negates the 'This' or the objective side of experience in Siva. The state in which objectivity is negated is called the very void. In Cit or Para Samvit, the 'V and the 'This' are in an indistinguishable unity. In Siva tattva, the 'This' is withdrawn through the operation of Sakti tattva, so that the 'I' side of the experience alone remains. This state is called Anasrita-Siva by Ksemaraja. As he puts it: Siva in this state appears a mere 'I' devoid of any objective content. In order that Siva may appear as the Universe, a break in the unitary experience becomes a necessary phase. But this is only a passing phase. To the Subjectivity disengag­ed from the objective content, the Universe is presented again * The word 'tattva' is untranslatable, It means the 'thatness' of a thing. The nearest English word is 'principle'."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 not as an indistinguishable unity but, an \"I-This\" in which both are distinguishable but not separable, as they form part of the same Self. Sakti polarizes Consciousness into Aham and Idam (I and This) - subject and object. Sakti, however, is nothing separate from Siva, but is Siva Himself in His creative aspect. She is His Aham-vimarsa (I-consciousness), His unmukhata - intentness to create. As Mahesvarananda puts it beautifully in his Maharthamanjari (p. 40, Trivandrum Edition): \"He (i.e., Siva) Himself full of joy enhanced by the honey of the three corners of his heart, viz., Iccha or Will, jnana or Knowledge, Kriya or action, raising up His face to gaze at {His own splendour) is called Sakti\". MaheSvarananda explains this further in the following words : \"When He becomes intent to roll out the entire splen­dour of the Universe that is contained in His heart (in a germinal form), he is designated as Sakti.\" Sakti is, therefore, his intentness to create. Sakti is the active or kinetic aspect of Consciousness. An idea parallel to VimarSa or unmukhata is found in the Chandogyopanisad 6. 2. 1-3: At first (logically, not chronologically) there was only 'Sat' - all alone without a second. He gazed and bethought to Himself \"May I be many, may I procreate !\" This Iksitrtva or Iksitakarma is parallel to VimarSa or unmukhata but the implications of this Iksitakarma have not been developed by Sankara Vedanta. The Saiva philosophy does not conceive of the Supreme as a logomachist but as an Artist. Just as an artist cannot contain his delight within himself, but pours it out into a song, a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10    Pratyabhijnahrdayam    picture or a poem, even so the Supreme Artist pours out the delightful wonder of His splendour into manifestation or crea­tion. Ksemaraja gives expression to the same idea in his commentary on Utpaladeva's Stotravali : \"Sakti thrown up by delight lets Herself go forth into mani­festation.\" All manifestation is, therefore, only a process of experienc­ing out, creative ideation of Siva. In Sakti tattva, ananda aspect of the Supreme is predomi­nant. Siva and Sakti tattvas can never be disjoined; they remain for ever united whether in creation or dissolution - Siva as the Experiencing Priniciple, experiencing Himself as pure-'I', and Sakti as profound bliss. Strictly speaking, Siva-Sakti tattva is not an emanation or abhdsa, but the Seed of all emanation. 3. Saddtiva or Sadakhya Tattva The will (Iccha) to affirm the 'This' side of the 'Universal Experience is known as Sadasiva Tattva or Sadakhya Tattva. In SadaSiva, Iccha or Will is predominant. The experience of this stage is I am. Since 'am' or 'being' is affirmed in this stage, it is called Sadakhya Tattva ('Sat' meaning 'being') but 'am' implies 'this' (I am, but 'am' what ? - I am 'this'). The experience of this stage is, therefore, 'I am this', but the 'this'is only a hazy experience (asphuta). The predominant side is still 'I'. The Ideal Universe is experienced as an indistinct something in the depth of consciousness. That is why this experience is called 'nimesa. The'This' (Idam) is faintly experienced by 'I' (Aham) as a part of the One Self; the emphasis is however, on the T side of experience. The 'This' (Idam) or the universe at this stage is like a hazy idea of the picture that an artist has at the initial stage of his creation. Rajanaka Ananda in his Vivarana on Sattrimsat-tattvasandoha very rightly says : (p. 3)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 11 \"In that stage, the 'This' side of the Experience is hazy like a picture of an artist which is about to be portrayed and hence which is still in an ideal state (i.e., in the state of an idea). Hence in this state it is Will that is predominant.\" That is why Ksemaraja says in his Pratyabhijnahrdaya : i.e., the Universe in Sadasiva tattva is asphuta or hazy dominat­ed by a clear consciousness of 'I'. Sadasiva tattva is the first manifestation (abhasa). For abhasa or manifestation, there must be aperceiver or knower and perceived or known i.e., a subject and an object. In this universal condition, both are bound to be Consciousness, for there is nothing else than Consciousness. Consciousness in this aspect becomes perceptible to Itself; hence a subject and an object. 4. Isvara or Aisvarya Tattva The next stage of the Divine experience is that where Idam - the 'This' side of the total experience becomes a little more defined (sphuta). This is known as Isvara Tattva. It is unmesa or distinct blossoming of the Universe. At this stage, jnana or knowledge is predominant. There is a clear idea of what is to be created. Rajanaka Ananda says in his Vivarana : \"As at this stage, the objective side of Experience, the 'This' or the Universe is clearly defined, therefore jnana-sakti is predominant.\" Just as an artist has at first a hazy idea of the picture he has to produce, but later a clearer image of the picture begins to emerge in his view, even so at the Sadasiva stage, the Universe is just a hazy idea, but at the Isvara stage, it becomes clearer. The experience of Sadasiva is \"I am this\". The experience of Isvara is: ''This am I.\" 5. Sadvidya or Suddhavidya Tattva In the Sadvidya tattva, the 'I' and the 'This' side of Experience are equally balanced like the two pans of an evenly held balance (samadhrtatulaputanyayena). At this stage, Kriya Sakti is predominant. The 'I' and 'This' are recognised in this"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12 Pratyabhijnahrdayam state with such equal clarity that while both 'I' and 'This' are still identified, they can be clearly distinguished in thought. The experience of this stage may be called diversity-in-unity bhedabhedavimarsanatmaka) i.e., while the'This' is clearly distinguished from 'I', it is still felt to be a part of the'I' or Self. Both 'I' and 'This' refer to the same thing (i.e., they have samanadhikaranya). In Siva tattva, there is the I-experience (Aham vimarSa); in Sadasiva, there is I-This experience (Aham-idam vimarsa); in Isvara tattva, there is This-I experience (Idamaham vimarSa). In each of these experiences, the emphasis is on the first term. In Suddhavidya tattva, there is equal emphasis on both. (Aham Aham - Idam Idam. I am I - This is This). Since this experience is intermediate - between the para or the higher and apara the lower - in which there is a sense of difference, it is called parapara dasa. It is called Sadvidya or Suddhavidya, because at this stage the true relation of things is experienced. Upto this stage, all experience is ideal i.e., in the form of an idea. Hence it is called the perfect or 'pure order' (Suddhadhvan) i.e., a manifestation in which the svarupa or real nature of the Divine is not yet veiled. II The Tattvas of the Limited Individual Experience 6-11. Maya and the five Kancukas At this stage, Maya tattva begins its play. From this stage onward there is ASuddhadhvan or the order in which the real nature of the Divire is concealed. All this happens because of Maya, and her kancukas. Maya is derived from the root 'ma', to measure out. That which makes experience measur­able i.e., limited and severs 'This'from'I'and 'I' from 'This' and excludes things from one another is Maya. Upto Sad­vidya, the experience was Universal; the 'This' meant 'all-this' - the total universe. Under the operation of Maya, 'this' means merely 'this' different from every thing else. From now on starts Sankoca or limitation.

We may notice them briefly: (i) Kala. This reduces the sarvakartrtva (universal author­ship) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limita­tion in respect of authorship or efficacy. (ii) Vidya. This reduces the omniscience (sarvajnatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of knowledge. (iii) Raga. This reduces the all-satisfaction (purnatva) of the Universal and brings about desire for this or that. (IV) Kala. This reduces the eternity (nityatva) of the Universal and brings about limitation in respect of time i.e., division of past, present, and future. (v) Niyati. This reduces the freedom and pervasiveness ((svatantrata and vyapakatva) ) of the Universal, and brings-about limitation in respect of cause and space. iii The Tattoos of the Limited Individual Subject-Object 12. Purusa Siva thus subjecting Himself to Maya and putting on the five kancukas or cloaks which limit His universal knowledge and power becomes Purusa or the individual subject. Purusa does not merely mean the human person, but every sentient being that is thus limited. Purusa is also known as Arm which literally means a point. Point does not mean a spatial point here, for Anu being divine in essence cannot be spatial. Purusa is called Anu because of the limitation of the divine perfection : 13. Prakrti While Purusa is the subjective manifestation of the 'I am this' experience of Sadvidya, Prakrti is the objective - Sattriihsattattoasandoha v.5"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14    Pratyabhijnahrdayam    manifestation. According to Trika, Prakrti is the objective effect of Kala -Prakrti is the barest objectivity in contrast with Purusa who is Vedaka or Subject. Prakrti exists in a state of equili­brium of her gunas. There is a difference between the Sahkhya conception of Prakrti and that of Trika. Sankhya believes that Prakrti is one and universal for all the Purusas. Trika believes that each Purusa has a different Prakrti. Prakrti is the root or matrix of objectivity. Prakrti has three gunas - threads or constituents, viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas (producing respectively sukha, duhkha, and moha). Prakrti is the Santa Sakti of Siva and the gunas Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas are the gross forms of His Saktis of Jnana, Iccha, and Kriya respectively. Purusa is the Experient (bhokta) and Prakrti is the experienced (bhogya) . iv. The Tattvas of Mental Operation 14-16 - Buddhi, Ahamkara, and Manas Prakrti differentiates into antahkarana (the psychic appara­tus), indriyas (senses) and bhutas (matter). We shall first take up antahkarana. It means literally the inner instrument i.e., the psychic apparatus of the individual. It consists of the tattvas by means of which there is mental opera­tion, viz., Buddhi, Ahamkara, and Manas. 1. Buddhi is the first tattva of Prakrti. It is the ascertaining intelligence (vyavasayatmika). The objects that are reflected in Buddhi are of two kinds : (a) external e.g., a jar, the reflection of which is received through the eye etc., (b) internal - the images built out of the samskaras (the impressions left behind on the mind). 2. Ahamkara. This is the product of Buddhi. It is the I-consciousness and the power of self-appropriation. 3. Manas. It is the product of Ahamkara. It cooperates with the senses in building up perceptions, and it builds up images and concepts. - Tantral, Ahn. 9"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction 15 V-VII.

Svatantryavada and Abhasavada Svatantryavada The Absolute in this system is known as Cit or ParamaSiva or Mahesvara. It is called Mahesvara not in the ordinary sense of God as the first cause that is to be inferred from the order and design in Nature. It is called MaheSvara because of its absolute sovereignty of Will, sva-tantrata or svatantrya. This absolute Sovereignty or Free Will is not a blind force but the svabhava (own being) of the Universal Consciousness (Cit). It is this sovereign Free Will that brings about the objectification of its ideation. It is free inasmuch as it does not depend on any thing external to it: it is free and potent to bring about anything. It is beyond all the categories of time, space, causality etc., for these owe their origin to it. - Isvara. Pr. I, p. 203-4 \"The Divine Power is known as Citi. Its essence is Self-Con­sciousness. It is also known as Para Vak. It is, in itself ever present, eternal. It is svatantrya. It is the main Power of the Supreme Self.\" Para Vak, Vimarsa, Aisvarya etc. are only the synonyms of Svatantrya. - Isvara. Pr. I p. 207-8 \"This Citi or power of Universal Consciousness is the inner, crea­tive flash which, though in itself unchanging, is the source of all apparent change; it is mahasatta or absolute being inasmuch as it is free to be anything, it is the source of all that can be said to exist in any way. It is beyond the determinations of space and time. In essence, this Free, Sovereign Will may be said to be the very heart or nucleus of the Divine Being.\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction 17 Svatantrya or Mahesvarya means Absolute Sovereignty or Freedom of Will. It connotes unimpeded activity of the Divine Will and is an expression of Self-Consciousness. \"Svatantrya means the Power to do according to one's will; it is the unimpeded, unrestrained flow of expression of the-Divine Will.\" Svatantryavada or the doctrine of the Absolute Sovereignty and Freedom of the Divine Will to express or manifest itself in any way it likes has been beautifully explained in the follow­ing words by Abhinavagupta: - IS. Pr. V.V. Pt. I, p. 9. \"Therefore the Lord, Parama Siva (the Absolute Reality) whose own being is Consciousness of the nature of PrakaSa and VimarSa, who as the undeniable, ever-present Reality appears as subject from Rudra down to immovable entities, as objects like blue, pleasure etc. which appear as if separate, though in essence they are not separate, through the glorious might of Svatantrya (Free Will) which is inseparable from Samvit (universal Consciousness) and w°hich does not conceal in any way the real nature of the Supreme. This is the exposition of Svatantrya-vada (the doctrine of Svatantrya).\" Abhasavada From the point of view of the creativity of Ultimate Reality, this philosophy is known as svatantryavada; from the point of view of its manifestation, it is known as abhasavada.. In the ultimate Reality, the entire manifested variety is in perfect unity, an undifferentiated mass just as the variegated plumage of the peacock with its beautiful, rich colour lies in a state of undifferentiated mass in the plasma of its egg. This is called in this system the analogy of the plasma of the peacock's egg (mayurandarasanyaya)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18 Pratyabhijnahrdayam The underlying principle of all manifestation is Cit or pure Universal Consciousness. The world of ever-changing appear­ances is only an expression of Cit or Samvid. All that appears in any form whether as an object or subject or knowledge or means of knowledge or senses, all that exists in any way is only an abhasa - a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness. The word abhasa = a i.e., isat (sankocena); bhasah = bhasanam or prakaSana. So abhasa is manifestation or appearance in a limited way. Every kind of manifestation has some sort of limitation. Every thing in existence is a configuration of abhasas. - Paramarthasara, 12-13 \"Just as in a clear mirror, varied images of city, village etc. appear as different from one another and from the mirror though they are non-different from the mirror, even so the world, though non-different from the purest consciousness of Parama Siva, appears as different both in respect of its varied objects and that Universal Consciousness.\" Abhasas are explained on the analogy of reflection in a mirror. Just as reflection in a mirror is not in any way different from the mirror, but appears as something different, even so abhasas are not different from Siva and yet appear as different Just as in a mirror, a village, a tree, river etc. appear as different from the mirror, but are, truly speaking, nothing different from it, even so the world reflected in the Universal Consciousness is nothing different from it. Two exceptions have, however, to be noted in the analogy of the mirror. Firstly, in the case of the mirror, there is an external object that is reflected: in the case of MaheSvara or Universal Consciousness, it is its own ideation that is re­flected. In the case of the mirror, there is an external light owing to which reflection is possible; in the case of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 19 Universal Consciousness, it is its own light; it is the Light of all lights; it does not require any external light. Secondly, the mirror being non-conscious does not know the reflections within itself, but the Universal Consciousness knows its own ideation which appears in itself. Abhasas are nothing but the ideation of the Universal Consciousness appearing as external to the empirical subject. - quoted by Yogaraja in Paramarthasara, p. 39 \"Just as a variety of objects appears, within a mirror, even so the entire universe appears within Consciousness or the Self. Consciousness, however, owing to its power of vimarsa or Self-consciousness knows the world, not so the mirror ics objects.\" All abhasas rise like waves in the sea of the Universal Con­sciousness. Just as there is neither loss nor gain to the sea with the rise and disappearance of the waves, even so there is neither loss nor gain to the Universal Consciousness because of the appearance and disappearance of the abhasas. Abhasas appear and disappear but the underlying Consciousness is unchanging. The abhasas are nothing but external projection of the ideation of the Divine. - IS.Pr. I. 5. 7 \"The Divine Being whose essence is Cit (Universal Conscious­ness) makes the collection of objects that are internally contained appear outside by His Will without any external material even as a Yogi (makes his mental objects appear out­side by his mere will).\" The Divine Being does not create like a pot-maker shaping clay into pots. Srsti only means manifesting outside what is"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20 Pratyabhijahrdayam contained within. The Divine does not require any external material for this. This is accomplished by His mere Will power. Things which are identical with the Divine Being's know­ledge or jnana appear by His Will as jneya or objects, things which are identical with His Self or 'I' appear as 'this' or the universe. To the empirical subjects, they appear as something external. It is the Universal Consciousness itself that appears in the form of subjects and objects. Therefore, this appearance can­not be called false. This appearance makes no difference to the Fullness or Perfection of the Universal Consciousness. Svatantryavada of this philosophy stands in contradistinction to vivartavada and abhasavada to parinamavada. 4. Sadadhva From another point of view, viz., of parasakti, manifestation or creative descent is described in the following way : There is an unbounded potency or basic continuum of power which is known as nada. This condenses itself into dynamic point or centre, called bindu. The condensation is not a process in time or space. This is the source of all manifestation. In the highest stage of manifestation, vacaka and vacya (the indi­cator and the indicated, the word and object) are one. Then there are six adhvas, paths or steps of creative descent. These are known as Sadadhva. First of all, there is the polarity of varna and kala Primarily, Kala is that aspect of Reality by which it manifests itself as power for evolving universes. The transcendental aspect of Reality or Parama Siva is known as nisala,for it transcends Kala or creativity. The immanent aspect of Siva is sakala for it is concerned with creativity. But in the present context, coming after nada-bindu, kala means a phase, an aspect of creativity. It is here that things begin to differentiate from an integrated whole. Vacaka and Vaya (index and object) which were one at the paravak stage begin to differentiate. The first adhva or step of this differen­tiation is the polarity of varna and kala. As Svami Pratyagat-mananda Sarasvati puts it, varna in this context does not mean"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction 21 letter or colour or class, but a 'function-form' of the object projected from bindu. Varna, therefore, connotes 'the character­istic measure-index of the function form associated with the object'. Varna is the 'function-form', Kala is 'predicable'. The next adhva in the subtle plane is that of mantra and tattva. Mantra is the 'appropriate function-form' or 'basic formula' of the next creative descent viz., tattva. Tattva is the inherent principle or the source and origin of subtle structural forms. The third and final polarity is that of pada and bhuvana. Bhuvana is the universe as it appears to apprehending centres like ourselves. Pada is the actual formulation of that universe by mind reaction and speech. The Sadadhva may be briefly indicated in the following table: -Vacaka or Sabda Varna Mantra Pada Vacya or artha Kala Tattva Bhuvana The trika or triad on the vacaka side is known as kaladhva; the trika or triad on the vacya side is known as desadhva. Varnadhva is of the nature of prama. It is the resting place of prameya (object), pramana (means of knowledge) and pramata (experient). Varna is of two kinds ; non-mayiya and mayiya. The mayiya varnas arise out of the non-mayiya. The non-mayiya varnas are pure, natural, without limitation and innumerable. The Vacaka Sakti (indicative power) of non-mayiya varnas is inherent in the mayiya varnas even as power of heating is inherent in fire. The kalas are five in number, viz., (1) Nivrtti kala, (2) Pratistha kala, (3) Vidya kala, (4) Santa or Santi kala, and (5) Santyatita kala. As for the tattvas and bhuvanas contained in each kala, see the diagram under Note no. 174 and the details given below the diagram. According to Abhinavagupta, there are 118 bhuvanas. According to some others, there are 224 bhuvanas. 5. Comparison and Contrast with Samkara's Advaitavada Samkara's philosophy is known as Santa brahmavada or Kevala-dvaitavada or sometimes, as Maya-Vedanta-vada. The Saiva"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22    Pratyabhijnahrdayam    philosophy of Kashmir is known as Isvaradvayavada or Pratyabhijha or Trika philosophy. Since Samkara believes that brahman has no activity, his philosophy is mostly characterized as Santabrahma-vada or the philosophy of inactive brahman by the Saiva philosophers. The first salient difference between Santabrahmavada and Isvaravayavada is that according to the former the characteristic of cit or brahman is only prakasa or jnana, whereas according to the latter it is both prakasa and vimarSa. In other words, .accord­ing to Samkara, the characteristic of brahman is only jnana (knowledge); according to Isvaradvayavada, it is both jnatrtva or (knowledge) and kartrtva (activity). Samkara thinks that kriya or activity belongs only to jiva or the empirical subject and not to brahman. He takes kriya in a very narrow sense. Saiva philo­sophy takes kartrtva or activity in a wide sense. According to it even jnana is an activity of the Divine. Without activity, Cit or the Divine being would be inert and incapable of bringing about anything. Since Parama Siva is svatantra (i.e., has sove­reign Free Will), therefore is he a karta (doer). As Panini puts it \"only a free-willed being is a doer\". Svatantrya (Free Will) and kartrtva (the power to act) are practically the same thing. In Santabrahmavada, brahman is entirely inactive. When brahman is associated with avidya, it becomes ISvara and is endowed with the power to act. The real activity belongs to avidya. The activity of ISvara ceases when he is dissociated from avidya. Samkara says categorically : (Br. Su.2. 1.14) \"Thus the potency of ISvara, his omniscience and omni­potence are contingent upon the limitation caused by the condition or association of avidya (primal ignorance). In the highest sense, when all conditions are removed by vidya (spiritual illumination) from the Atman, the use of potency, omniscience etc. would become inappropriate for it.\" So all activity in the case of Isvara is, according to Samkara, due to avidya."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 23 On the other hand, jnatrtva and kartrtva (knowledge and activity) are according to ISvaradvayavada, the very nature of the Supreme. Never can the Supreme be thought of without His activity. In this philosophy, activity is not an adjunct of Isvara as in Samkara, but His very specific nature. In general terms, His activity may be summed up in the five-fold act of emanation or projection (srsti), maintenance (sthiti) with­drawal (samhara), concealment of the real nature (vilaya), and grace (anugraha). He performs these five acts eternally even when he assumes the form of an empirical ego (jiva). Accord­ing to Isvaradvayavada,Siva is pancakrtyakari (always perform­ing five-fold act). According to Samkara, brahman is niskriya (without any activity). Mahesvarananda says that inactive brahman is as good as unreal. (Maharthamanjari, p.52) \"This is the specific nature of Paramesvara (Highest Lord) that He always performs the five-fold act of srsti etc. If this (i.e., activity) is not accepted, Atma as defined by Maya-Vedanta etc., characterized by the want of the slightest trace of stir or activity would be as good as unreal.\" ISvaradvayavada also accepts avidya or maya, but, according to it, avidya or maya is not something which happens to affect Isvara; it is rather Isvara's own voluntarily self-imposed limi­tation of Himself by His own Sakti (power). According to Sam­kara, brahman is entirely inactive; all activity is due to maya. According to Isvaradvayavada, activity belongs to ISvara; maya derives only its activity from Him. Secondly, maya, according to Santabrahmavada is anirvacaniya (indefinable), but according to Isvaradvayavada, maya being the Sakti of Isvara or Siva is real and brings about multiplicity and sense of difference. According to Santabrahmavada, visva or the universe is mithya or unreal. According to ISvaradvayavada, the universe is perfectly real; it is simply a display of Isvara's power. Since Sakti is real, the universe which has been brought about by"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24 Pratyabhijnahrdayam sakti is also real. Since Samkara considers maya as neither real nor unreal  , his non-dualism is exclusive, but the non-dual Saiva philosophy considers maya as siva-mayi (an aspect of Siva), therefore the Saiva non-dualism is integral, all-inclusive. If brahman is real and maya is some indeterminate force - neither real nor unreal as Samkara maintains, then there \"would be a tinge of dualism in Samkara's philosophy. Again, according to Isvaradvayavada, even in the state of the empirical ego or jiva, the five-fold act of Siva continues; accord­ing to Santabrahmavada, atma (self) even in the state of the empirical ego is niskriya or inactive. Whatever activity there is belongs to buddhi. According to Samkara's vivartavada, all manifestation is only name and form (nama-rupa) and cannot be regarded as real in the true sense of the word. According to Isvaradvayavada, the abhasas are real in the sense that they are aspects of the ulti­mately real or Parama Siva. Though they do not exist in Parama Siva in the same way in which limited beings experi­ence them, they exist in Parama Siva as His experience or ideation. So the abhasas are in essence real. What constitutes the ideation of the Real cannot itself be unreal. Finally, in mukti (liberation), the world, according to Sam­kara, is annulled; in Saiva philosophy, it appears as a gleam of Siva-consciousness or an expression of the wondrous delight of self-consciousness. We may summarize the views of the two systems in a tabular form. 1. 2. Santabrahmavada Cit or brahman is only pra-kaia (light) or jnana (know­ledge). It is niskriya (in­active) Activity belongs only to maya or avidya. ISvara assumes activity only when Isvaradvayavada Cit is both prakasa and vimarsa (light and activity). Therefore it has both jnatrtva (knowledge) and kartrtva (doership). Gene­rally speaking, it has five-fold activity. Mahesvara has svatantrya. Therefore activity belongs to Him. Maya is not something"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction 25 He is affected by avidya or maya. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Maya is anirvacaniya (in­definable) Maya being indefinable is loosely associated with IS-vara and is, in the last ana­lysis, unreal. Maya seems to play the role of a sepa­rate principle. Samkara's non-dualism is, therefore exclusive. In the case of the empirical ego or jiva also, the atman is inactive All activity be­longs to buddhi, the product of prakrti The universe is mithya or unreal. Manifestation is only nama-rupa and cannot be regarded as real in the true sense. Sarhkara's non-dualism is exclusive of the universe. In liberation, the universe is annulled. According to Samkara Vedanta, avidya is removed by vidya, and when this happens, there is mukti or liberation. Vidya is the result of sravana, manana, and nididhyasana. which affects Mahesvara or Siva. Maya is His own Sakti by which, He brings about multi­plicity and sense of difference. Maya being the Sakti of the Divine is perfectly real. Maya is Siva-mayi or cinmayi and is thus Siva's own iakti. It is not a separate principle. Therefore, Saiva non-dualism is inclusive and integral. Even in the case of jiva, the five-fold activity of Siva never ceases. The universe is Siva-rupa and therefore real. It is a display of the glory of the Divine. Abhasas being the ideation of Siva cannot be false. Saiva philosophy is thus inclusive of the universe and real non-dualism. In liberation, the universe appears as a form of Siva-consciousness or real I-consci-ousness. According to non-dualistic Saiva philosophy, there are two kinds of ajnana, viz., pau-rusa ajnana which is inherent in the purusa or anu and bauddha ajnana which is intellectual. By Vidya only bauddha ajnana"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 Pratyabhijnahrdayam can be removed; paurusa ajnana will still remain. Such a person will be landed only in blank abstractions, he will not realize Sivatva or divinization. Paurusa ajnana has also to be removed. This can be removed only by saktipata which comes about either by the diksa (ini­tiation)) imparted by a self-realized guru (spiritual direc­tor) or by direct divine grace. 6. The Individual Self or Siva The individual according to this system is not simply a psycho-physical being but something more. His physical aspect consists of the five mahabhutas or gross elements highly organised. This is known as his sthulasarira. He has also the psychic apparatus known as antahkarana (the inner instrument) consisting of buddhi, ahamkara and manas. Buddhi, ahamkara and manas together with the five tanmatras form a group of eight which is known as puryastaka. This is the suksmasarrra in which the soul leaves the body at the rime of death. There also works in him prana Sakti. This is the divine Sakli working both in the universe and the individual. It is by this pram Sakti that everything is sustained and maintained. There is also kundalini that is a form or expression of sakti. This lies dormant in the normal human being. Finally there is caitanya or Siva in the centre of his being-that is his very Self. Though intrinsically the Self of man is Siva, he becomes an anu or a limited individual because of anava mala. 7. Bondage The bondage of the individual is due to innate ignorance which is known as anava mala. It is the primary limiting"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction 27 condition which reduces the universal consciousness to an ana or a limited aspect. It comes about by the limitation of the Iccha Sakti of the Supreme. It is owing to this that the jiva considers himself a separate entity, cut off from the universal stream of consciousness. It is consciousness of self-limitation. Coming in association with the categories of the asuddha adhva or the order of the extrinsic manifestation, he becomes further limited by mayiya mala and karma mala. Mayiya mala is the limiting condition brought about by maya. It is bhinna-vedya-pratha - that which brings about the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the body etc. This comes about by the limitation of the jnana sakti of the Supreme. It is by these malas that the individual is in bondage whirled about from one form of existence to another. 8. Liberation Liberation according to this system means the re-cognition (pratyabhijna) of one's true nature which means in other words the attainment of akrtrima-aham-vimarsa - the original, innate, pure I-consciousness. The following verse of Utpaladeva gives an idea of pure I-Consciousness. - IS. Pr. I. 6.1. The pure I-consciousness is not of the nature of vikalpa, for vikalpa requires a second i.e., all vikalpa is relational. The nor­mal, psychological I-Consciousness is relational i.e., the Self-Consciousness is in contrast with the not-Self. The pure I-consciousness is not of this relational type. It is immediate aware-ness. When one has this consciousness, one knows one's real nature. This is what is meant by liberation. As Abhinava-gupta puts it: - Tantraloka. I. p. 192."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 Pratyabhijnahrdayam Moksa (liberation) is nothing else but the awareness of one's true nature. By this real I-consciousness, one attains Cidananda - the bliss of the cit or Universal Consciousness. The citta or the individual mind is now transformed into Cit or Universal con­sciousness (vide Sutra 13 of Pr. Hr.). The attainment of this pure I-consciousness is also the attainment of Siva-Conscious­ness in which the entire universe appears as I or Siva. According to this system, the highest form of ananda or bliss is jagadananda - the bliss of the world in which the whole world appears to the liberated soul as Cit or Siva. This liberation cannot be achieved by mere logic-chopping or intellectual pyrotechnic. It comes by Saktipata (the descent of Divine Sakti) or anugraha i.e., Divine grace. Saktipata or Anugraha Those who, owing to the sarhskaras of previous birth, are very advanced souls receive tivra or intense Saktipata. They are liberated without much sadhana or praxis. Those who are less qualified receive madhyama Saktipata. This induces them to seek a guru or spiritual preceptor, to get initia­tion and practise yoga. In due course, they get liberation. Those who are still less qualified receive manda (moderate) saktipata. This creates in them genuine eagerness for spiritual knowledge and meditation. They will also get liberation in course of time. Updyas But grace is not the outcome of caprice. It has to be earned by moral and spiritual discipline. The means of earning grace have been divided under four broad heads, viz., Anavopaya, Saktopaya, Sambhavopaya, and Anupaya. These upayas are recommended to get rid of the malas so that one may be­come fit for receiving grace."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Introduction 29 Anavopaya is the means whereby the individual utilizes his own karanas or instruments as means for his transformation for Self-realization. It includes disciplines concerning the regula­tion of prana, rituals, concentration on one's chosen deity etc. Ultimately, it brings about Self-realization by the unfolding of madhya-dhama or susumna. It is also known as kriyopaya, because Kriya - such as repetition of a mantra and the practice of rituals etc. - plays an important part in it. This is also known as bhedopaya, because this discipline starts with a sense of bheda or difference. Saktopaya is concerned with those psychological practices which transform the inner forces, and bring about in the indivi dual samavesa or immersion of the individual consciousness in the divine. In this mostly mantra sakti comes into play by which the individual acquires pratibha jnana or true knowledge; gra­dually his feeling of duality gets less and less and his conscious­ness merges in para-samvid. In this discipline one has to medi­tate something like this \"I am Siva\", \"The whole universe is only an expansion of my true Self\". In anavopaya, the senses, prana and manas are pressed into service; in Saktopaya, it is manas only that functions actively. It is also known as jndnopaya, because mental activities play an important role in it. It is also known as bhedabheda-upaya, be­cause it is based both on difference and identity. By this, the kundalini rises up from muladhdra without much effort for the control of prana and brings about Self-realization. Sambhavopaya is meant for advanced aspirants who by meditating on Sivatattva attain to His consciousness. This is the path of 'constant awareness'. One starts with the analysis of panca-krtya, sadhana of vikalpa-ksaya, and the practice of the consciousness that the universe is only reflection of cit, but later even these have to be given up. This leads easily to pure I-consciousness. Anupaya can hardly be called an upaya. This depends en­tirely on anugraha or grace. This grace may come through one word of the guru (spiritual director) and light may dawn upon the aspirant and thus he may acquire an experience of the real self in a trice or divine grace may be showered on him directly"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30 Pratyabhijnahrdayam and he may instantly realize his Self. The prefix 'an' in anupaya has been explained by some in the sense of isat or very little. In this sense anupaya means very little or nominal effort on the part of the aspirant. In both cases, anupaya connotes realiza­tion, solely through very intense grace (tivratama saktipata). Sometimes by the very sight of a person who has acquired self-realization, an aspirant receives illumination, and is trans­formed. Anupaya is generally designated as anandopdya. Ksemaraja says that by the development of the madhya or centre, one attains cidananda or bliss of the Supreme conscious­ness. This madhya is to be conceived separately from the point of view of the above three upayas. From the point of view of the anavopaya, 'madhya' is the susumna nadi between the ida and pingala that has to be unfolded. From the point of view of saktopaya, 'madhya' is the pard-samvid that has to be reached. From the point of view of Sambhavopaya it is akrtrima aham or the pure I-consciousness that is the 'madhya' or centre of everything. It is the madhya that has to be attained by one of the above means. For the unfoldment of madhya, Ksemaraja recommends vikalpa-ksaya, Sakti-sankoca, sakti-vikasa, vaha-ccheda, and the practice of ddyanta-koli (for details, see Sutra 18). Of these, vikalpa-ksaya is Sambhavopaya, Saktisankoca and vikasa are Saktopaya, and vaha-ccheda and adyanta-kotinibhalana are anavopaya. Pratyabhijna lays the greatest stress on the meditation on panca-krtya and the practice of vikalpa-ksaya. It maintains that the five-fold act of Siva, viz., srsti, sthiti, samhara, vilaya and anugraha is going on constantly even in the individual. The as­pirant should constantly dwell on the esoteric meaning of this five-fold act in order to rise to higher consciousness. The mental perception of the individual with reference to a particular place and time is the srsti in him, the retention and enjoyment of what he perceives is the sthiti or preservation. At the time of the delight of I-consciousness, it is absorbed in consciousness. This is samhara. When even after its being withdrawn, its impres­sion is about to rise into consciousness again, it corresponds to vilaya. When it is completely absorbed into Cit or true Self by the process of hatha-paka, it is anugraha. (Sutra 11 may be consulted"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Jntroduction 31 for details). This practice qualifies the aspirant for pure cidananta. Another method is vikalpa-ksaya. The mind is the happy hunting-ground of all kinds of ideas that rise one after another like waves upon the sea. We get involved in these ideas and are unable to get behind them to the placidity of the under­lying consciousness. The practice of vikalpa-ksaya is recommended for getting rid of ksobha or mental agitation, and recapturing the underlying consciousness, on the surface of which the vikalpas have their play. This cannot be done by force, for that creates resistance. This can be achieved only by alert passivity, by relax­ing the citta or mind, by not thinking of anything in particular, and yet not losing awareness. By these practices, one acquires samavesa or immersion into the divine consciousness. In order that this samavesa may be full, perfect and an enduring experience, one has to practise Krama-mudra (for details of Krama-mudra, see Sutra 19). By Krama-mudra, the experience of identification of the individual consciousness with the Universal Consciousness has to be carried out into the experience of the outer world. This system does not believe that samavesa to be complete which lasts only so long as samadhi (contemplation) lasts, and disappears after one rises from that state. It believes that that is perfect samavesa in which even after getting up from the contemplative state, it continues, and the world no longer appears as mere 'earth, earthy', but as 'apparelled in celestial light', as an expression, and play of the Universal Consciousness, and the aspirant feels himself also as nothing but that consciousness. Then the world is no longer something to be shunned, but an eternal delight (jagadananda). Then does one truly acquire akrtrima-aham-vimarsa - pure I-consciousness in which the world does not stand over against the I in opposition but is the expression of that I itself. This is the conception of jivan-mukti in this system. The world-process starts from the pure I-consciousness of Siva. At the level of man that I-consciousness gets identified with its physical and psychic coverings, and the world stands over against it as something different toto caelo. The task of man is to re-ca.pture that pure I-consciousness in which it and the uni­verse are one."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32 Pratyabhijnahrdayamr Surely, such a stage cannot be reached all at once. The system visualizes a hierarchy of experients who rise gradually in the evolutionary process to the pure I-consciousness of Siva. The normal individual is known as sakala. He has all the three malas - karma, mayiya and anava. After many rebirths during which he is the plaything of Nature - both physical and psychic, he is seized with psychic fever and tries to know the whence and the whither of this life. This is the first expression of the anugraha of Siva. If he is not very cautious and indulges in lower kinds of yoga, he may become a pralayakala. He is free from karma mala, and has only mayiya and anava mala, but he has neither jnana nor kriya. This is not a desirable state. At the time of pralaya or withdrawal of the universe, every sakala becomes a pralayakala.. Vijnanakala is an experient of a higher stage. He has risen above maya but is still below Suddha Vidya. He is free from the karma and mayiya malas but has still anava mala. He has jnana and iccha, but no kriya. Above the vijnanakala are the experients in successive ascent known as Mantra, Mantresvara, Mantra-mahesvara and Siva-pramata. These are free from all the three malas, but they have varying experience of unity consciousness (for details, the chart in Note no. 39 may be seen). It is only to the Siva-pramata that every thing appears as Siva. Pure I-consciousness is the fons et origo of the entire world process. Involution starts from the pure I-consciousness of Siva. Evolution gets back to the same pure consciousness, but the pilgrim goes back to his home, enriched with the experience of the splendour of Siva he has had on the way.

Universe in this context means everything from Sadasiva down to the earth. Siddhi means bringing into manifestation, maintenance, and withdrawal. Citi - The absolute consciousness alone is the power that brings about manifestation. Maya, Prakrti is not the cause of manifestation. Inasmuch as it (Citi) is the source of both subject, object, and pramana (means of proof), no means of proof can prove it (i.e. it is its own source). Siddhi may be taken in another sense also. It may mean bhoga (experience) and moksa (liberation). Of these also the absolute freedom of the ultimate divine consciousness is the cause. The word 'hetu' in the sutra means not only cause in which sense it has been already interpreted above. It also means 'means'. So Citi is also the means of the individual's ascension to the highest consciousness where he becomes identified with the divine consciousness. Citi has been used in the singular to show that it is unlimit­ed by space, time etc. It has been called svatantra (of free will) in order to show that it by itself is powerful to bring about the universe without the aid of Maya etc. Citi is, therefore, the cause of manifestation, the means of rising to Siva, and also the highest end. This Sutra strikes the key-note of the entire book. Sutra 2 : By the power of her own free will does she (Citi) unfold the universe upon her own screen. She brings about the universe by the power of her own free will, and not by any extraneous cause. The universe is already contained in her implicitly, and she makes it explicit. Sutra 3 : This (i.e. the Universe) is manifold because of the differentiation of reciprocally adapted objects and subjects."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Analysis of Contents 35 The universe appears to be different and manifold because of the differentiation of experients and the objects experienc­ed. These may be summarised thus : 1. At the level of Sadasiva-tattva, the I-consciousness is more prominent; the experience of the universe is just in an incipient stage. The individual experient who rises to such a level of consciousness is known as Mantra-maheSvara and is directed by SadaSiva. He has realized Sadasiva-tattva and his experience is of the form - \"I am this\". The consciousness of this (the universe) is not fully marked out from the 'I' at this level. 2. At the level of Isvara-tattva, the consciousness of both 'I' and 'this' is equally distinct. The individual experient who rises to this level is known as MantreSvara. The universe-is clearly distinct at this stage, but it is identified with the Self. MantreSvara is directed by ISvara. 3. At the level of Vidya-tattva, the universe appears as different from 'I'. There is an experience of diversity;, though there is unity in diversity. The individual experients of this stage are known as Mantras. They are directed by Ananta-bhatta-raka. They have an experience of diversity all round, of the universe as being distinct from the Self (though it may still belong to the Self). 4. The stage of the experient below Suddha vidya, but above Maya is that of Vijnanakala. His field of experience consists of sakalas and pralayakalas. He feels a sense of identity with them. 5. At the stage of Maya, the experient is known as pralayakevalin. He has neither a clear consciousness of 'I', nor of 'this', and so his consciousness is practically that of the void. 6. From Maya down to the earth, the experient is sakala •who experiences diversity all round. The average human being belongs to this level. Siva transcends all manifestation. His experience is that of permanent bliss and identity with every thing from SadaSiva down to the earth. Actually it is Siva who flashes forth in various forms of manifestation."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 Pratyabhijnahrdayam Sutra 4 : The individual (experient) also, in whom citi or cons-ciousness is contracted has the universe {as his body) in a contracted form. It is Siva or Cit that by assuming contraction becomes both the universe and the experients of the universe. Knowledge of this constitutes liberation. Sutra 5 : Citi (universal consciousness) itself descending from (the stage of) Cetana becomes citta (individual consciousness) inasmuch as it becomes contracted in conformity with the object of consciousness. The universal consciousness itself becomes the individual consciousness by limitation. The universal consciousness in the process of limitation has either (1) the predominance of cit or (2) the predominance of limitation. In the former case, there is the stage of Vjnanakala when prakasa is predominant, or Suddha-vidya-pramata, when both prakasa and vimarsa are predominant, or Ila, SadaSiva, AnaSrita-Siva. In the latter case, there is the stage of Sunya-pramata etc. The universal consciousness itself by assuming limitation becomes individual consciousness. Jnana, Kriya and Maya of the universal consciousness become sattva, rajas and tamas in the case of the individual. Sutra 6 : The maya-pramata consists of it (i. e. citta). The maya-pramata also is only Citta. Sutra 7 : And (though) he is one, he becomes of two-fold form, three-fold, four-fold and of the nature of seven pentads. The Cit is Siva Himself. Consciousness cannot be sundered by space and time. Since by limitation it assumes the state of the experient and the object experienced, it is also of two forms. It also becomes three fold as it is covered with the mala pertaining to anu, maya, and karma. It is also four fold, because it assumes the nature of (1) sunya, (2) prana, (3) puryastaka, and (4) the gross body.

Sutra 8 : The positions of the various systems of philosophy are only various roles of that (consciousness or Self). The positions of the various systems of philosophy are, so to speak, roles assumed by the Self. 1. The Carvakas, for instance, maintain that the Self is identical with the BODY characterised by consciousness. 2. The followers of Nyaya practically consider BUDDHI to be the Self in the worldly condition. After liberation, they consider Self as identical with the void. 3. The Mimamsakas also practically consider Buddhi to be the Self inasmuch as they believe the I-CONSCIOUSNESS to be the Self. 4. The Buddhists also consider only the functions of BUDDHI as the Self. 5. Some Vedantins regard PRANA as the Self. 6. Some of the Vedantins and the Madhyamikas regard 'NON-BEING' as the fundamental principle. 7. The followers of Pancaratra believe Vasudeva to be the highest cause. 8. The followers of Sankhya practically accept the position of the Vijnanakalas. 9. Some Vedantins accept ISVARA as the highest principle. 10. The Grammarians consider PASYANTI or SADASIVA to be the highest reality. 11. The Tantrikas consider the ATMAN as transcending the universe to be the highest principle. 12. The Kaulas consider the UNIVERSE as the Atman prin­ciple. 13. The followers of Trika philosophy maintain that the ATMAN is both immanent and transcendent.

The Will-power being limited, there arises the anava mala, the mala pertaining to the jiva by which he considers himself to be imperfect. Omniscience being limited, there arises knowledge of a few things only. Thus there comes to be mayiya mala, which consists in the apprehension of all objects as different. Omnipotence being limited, the jiva acquires karma mala. Thus due to limitation, sarva-kartrtva (Omnipotence) becomes kala (limited agency), sarvajnatva (Omniscience) becomes vidya (limitation in respect of knowledge), purnatva (all fulfilment) becomes raga (limitation in respect of desire), nityatva (eternity) becomes Kala (limitation in respect of time), vyapakatva (Omnipresence) becomes niyati (limitation in respect of space and cause). Jiva (the individual soul) is this limited self. When his Sakti is unfolded, he becomes Siva Himself. Sutra 10; Even in this condition (of empirical self), he (the individual soul) does the five krtyas like Him (i.e. like Siva). Just as Siva does the five fold act in mundane manifestation as an unfoldment of His real nature, so does He do it - in the limited condition of a jiva. The appearance of objects in a definite space and time is tantamount to srastrta (emanation), their appearance in another space and time and thus their disappearance to the individual soul constitutes samhartrta (withdrawal); continuity of the appearance of the objects constitutes sthapakata (maintenance). Because of the appearance of difference, there is vilaya (concealment). When the object is identical with the light of consciousness, it is anugraha (grace). Sutra 11 : He also does the five-fold act of manifesting, relishing, thinking out, setting of the seed and dissolution. This is so from the esoteric stand-point of the Yogin. Whatever is perceived is abhasana or srsti. The perception"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Analysis of Contents 39 is relished for sometime. This is rakti or sthiti. It is with­drawn at the time of knowledge. This is samhara. If the object of experience generates\" impressions of doubt etc., it becomes in germ the cause of transmigratory existence. This is bijavasthapana or vilaya. If the object of experience is identified with consciousness, it is the state of vilapana or anugraha. Sutra 12: To be a samsarin means being deluded by one's own powers because of the ignorance of that {i.e. authorship of the Jive-fold act.) In the absence of the knowledge of the five-fold act, one becomes deluded by one's own powers, and thus transmigrates ever and anon. While talking of Sakti, we would do well to realize that the highest Vak Sakti has the knowledge of the perfect 'I'. She is the great mantra inclusive of the letters 'a' to ksa', and reveal­ing the empirical experient. At this stage, she conceals the pure distinctionless consciousness and throws up ever new forms different from one another. The empirical experient deluded by the various powers considers the body, prana etc. as the Self. Brahmi and other Saktis bring about emanation and maintenance of difference and withdrawal of identity in the empirical subject (pasu-daSa). At the stage of 'pati', they do the reverse i.e. bring about the emanation and maintenance of identity, and withdrawal of difference. Gradually they bring about the state of 'avikalpa'. This is known as pure Vikalpa power. The above technique of establishing unity-consciousness is known as 'Sambhavopaya'. Now follows Saktopaya or Sakta technique of unity - Con­sciousness. Cit-Sakti in this context is known as Vamesvari. Her sub­species are khecari, gocari, dikcari, bhucari. These bring about objectification of the universal consciousness. By khecari iakti, the universal consciousness becomes an individual subject; by gocari sakti, he becomes endowed with an inner psychic apparatus; by dikcari Sakti, he is endowed with outer senses, by"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 Pratyabhijnahrdayatn bhucari, he is confined to external objects. By yogic practice, khecari brings about consciousness of perfect agency; gocari brings about consciousness of non-difference, dikcari brings about a sense of non-difference in perception, bhucari brings about a consciousness of all objects as parts of one Self. There is a third technique known as anavopaya. When the aisvarya Sakti of the Lord conceals her real nature in the case of the individual and deludes him by prana etc., by the various states of waking, dreaming etc, and by the body both gross and subtle, he becomes a samsarin. When in the yogic process, she unfolds the udana sakti, and the uydna sakti, the individual comes to acquire the experience of turya and turyatita states, and becomes liberated while living. Sutra 13 : Acquiring full knowledge of it (i.e. of the five-fold act of the Self) Citta itself becomes Citi by rising to the status of cetana. When the knowledge of the five-fold act of the Self dawns on the individual, ignorance is removed. The Citta (individual consciousness) is no longer deluded by its own limiting powers; it re-captures its original freedom, and by acquiring a know­ledge of its real nature, rises to the status of Citi (i.e. universal consciousness). Sutra 14 : The fire of Citi even when it descends to the (lower) stage, though covered (by maya) partly burns the fuel of the known (i.e. the objects). If citi is non- differentia ting consciousness intrinsically, why is it that it is characterized by a sense of difference at the level of the individual? The answer is that even at the level of the individual, Citi does not completely lose its nature of non-differentiation, for all the multifarious objects as known are assimilated to Citi itself i.e. in the knowledge-situation, the objects become a part and parcel of Citi. As fire reduces to itself every thing thrown into it, even so, Citi assimilates to itself all the objects of knowledge. Only owing to its being covered by Maya, citi does not reduce objects of knowledge to itself completely, for owing to the previous impressions (samskaras),), these objects appear again."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Analysis of Contents 41 Sutra 15 : In the re-assertion of its (inherent) power, it makes the universe its own.

Therefore, the practice recommended for acquiring the power of Citi is meant only for the removal of the false identification of oneself with the body etc. Sutra 16 : When the bliss of Cit is attained, there is the lasting acquisition of that state in which Cit is our only Self, and in which all things that appear are identical with Cit. Even the body etc. that is experienced appears as identical with Cit. The steady experience of identity with Cit means jivanmukti (liberation even in this physical body). This comes about by the dissolution of ignorance on the recognition of one's true nature. Sutra 17 -By the development of the centre is acquisition of the bliss of the spirit. By the development of the centre can the bliss of the spirit be obtained. Samvit or the power of consciousness is called the centre, because it is the support or ground of every thing in the world.

Sankoca of sakti means withdrawing of consciousness that rushes out through the gates of the senses, and turning it inwardly towards the Self. Vikasa of Sakti means holding the consciousness steadily within, while the senses are allowed to perceive their objects. Another way of acquiring sankoca and vikasa of sakti is the practice of prasara and visranti in the stage of urdhva kundalini. Emergence from samadhi while retaining its experience is prasara or vikasa, and merging back into samddhi and resting in that condition is visranti or sankoca. A third method is vaha-ccheda i.e. cessation of prana and apana by repeating inwardly the letters 'ka', 'ha' etc. without the vowels, and tracing the mantras back to their source where they are unuttered. A fourth method is adyanta-koti-nibhalana i.e. the practice of fixing the mind at the time of the arising of prana and its coming to an end between the ddi i.e. the first or heart and the anta i.e. the distance of twelve lingers from the point between the two eye-brows. Sutra 19 : In vyutthana which is full of the after-effects of samddhi, there is the attainment of permanent samadhi, by dwelling on one's identity with Cit (universal consciousness) over and over again.

One's own experience would bear witness to this fact (lit. in this matter). The other things, viz., Maya, Prakrti etc., since they are (supposed to be) different from the light of consciousness can never be a cause of anything (lit. anywhere), for not being able to appear owing to their supposed difference from consciousness-power, they are (as good as) non-existent. But if they appear, they become one with the light (of conscious­ness). Hence Citi which is that light alone is the cause. Never is the other one (viz., Maya, Prakrti) any cause. Therefore, space, time, and form which have been brought into being and are vitalized by it (Citi) are not capable of penetrating its real nature, because it is all-pervading, eternal (lit. ever risen),22 and completely full (in itself).

In these circumstances, and deluded by the peculiar Saktis in the form of 'ka' and other consonants which are presided over by Brahmi108 and other deities, the deluded man helplessly considers the body, pranas etc. themselves which are limited as the Self. Brahmi and the other deities, in the stage of pasu (the bound soul), manifesting emanation and maintenance in res­pect of differences, and withdrawal in respect of non-difference, bring about only fitness for limited vikalpas. In the pati (lord) stage, however, these (deities) manifesting withdrawal in respect of difference and emanation and maintenance in respect of non-difference,109 gradually by reducing the vikalpas, (ulti­mately) disclose the great avikalpa stage which enables one to enter into the blissful bhairava-mudra,110 at which stage, they (the Saktis) cause to appear the pure vikalpa sakti111 which is deeply merged in consciousness and bliss (which enables one to feel like the following)"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"81 \"He who knows that all this glory (of manifestation) is mine (i. e. belongs to the spirit), who realizes that the entire cosmos is his Self, possesses mahesata112 even when the vikalpasa113 have their play.\" (Isvara-pratya-bhijna, Agamadhikara II Ahnika, 12th verse). Hence the state of a samsarin (transmigrant) consists, as explained above, in the delusion brought about by one's own saktis.

[Below is given the anavopaya - the anava-technique of attaining unity-consciousness.] Again the highest Lord whose essential nature is consci­ousness has his own aisvarya-Sakti117 which is unique, unfailing and whose essential nature consists in doership118 which is essentially a sphuratta or flashing forth117 of divine light.

When, however, she unfolds the uddna-sakti123 that appears in madhyadhama124 as of the nature of turya125 state and vyanasakti126 whose essence is to pervade the universe and which appears as of the nature of turyatita,127 and both of which are a mass of consciousness and bliss, then even in the state of body etc. one reaches the stage of pati128 and attains liberation while still living. Thus 'being deluded by one's own saktis (powers)' has been interpreted in three ways. In the cidvat sutra129 (sutra 9), it has been said that the light of consciousness itself assuming limitation becomes a sam-sarin (an individual migrating from one conditioned existence to another).

As the Agama says : \"They are the highest Lord in a veiled from, having entered a human body.\" It has also been said in a commentary180 on the Pratyabhijna.

Recognition - This is the doctrine which teaches that the individual self (nara or jiva) is identical with the Universal Self (Siva). He has forgotten his Real Self owing to the limitations of his psycho-physical mechanism. The Saiva doctrine of Kashmir is called Pratyabhijna-darsana or the Philosophy of Recognition because it brings home to the indi­vidual the truth that once he recognises his Real Self, he will be free from his ego-hood which is the product of his identi­fication of himself with his psycho-physical mechanism, and will thus realize that his Real Self is identical with the Univer­sal Self. Isvara-pratyabhijna-vimarsini by Abhinavagupta gives the following exposition of Pratyabhijna. \"Prati+abhi+jna=pratyabhijna, 'Prati'means pratipam i.e. contrary, in other words though known, now appearing as forgotten through delusion 'Abhi' means facing i.e. close at hand. 'Jna' means illumination or knowledge. So Pratyabhijna means re-cognition of the real self. 'Pratipam' implies that it is not that the consciousness of self has not been a fact of experience before, for Self is a light that can never be cut off (i.e. it is an ever-present light), but that, as will be explained in the sequel, through its own Power, it appears as though cut off or limited. Recognition (Pratyabhijna) consists in the unification of what appeared before with what is appearing"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"118 Pratyabhijnahrdayam now, as in the judgement \"This is the same Caitra\". It is a cognition by recollection, referring to what is directly present. In ordinary life also, recognition consists in unification of experiences at the time of a subsequent appearance of one who was known before either in general terms, or in particular as 'the son of so and so, of such and such qualities and descrip­tion', or in a statement like 'so and so has been made to be recognised by the king'. In the present context also, the knowledge of the Lord as one who has perfect power, having been acquired through the well-known Puranas, Siddhanta Agama, inference etc., and the immediate experience of one's Self being there, re-cognition arises, through the unification of the two experiences, in the form \"Certainly, I am that very Lord\". This system is also known as Trika darsana i.e. the system of the triad, viz., (1) Nara, the bound Soul (2) Sakti, the divine power and (3) Siva, the lord who releases the bound soul from his bondage. This is a mystic philosophy, describing all these three conditions. It is also called Spandasstra or the system of vibration,. because it is to the vibrating energy or Sakti of Siva that the world-process owes its existence. 2. Siva - This is derived from the root Si (to lie), and from the root Svi (to cut asunder). Both these meanings are implied in Siva. Siva is one 'in whom all things (viz., all objects and subjects) lie'. He is also one who cuts asunder (Syati papam iti Sivah) all sins. Siva is thus both the funda­mental ground of all reality and the supreme Benevolence or Good who by His grace saves all. He is the supreme or Abso­lute both from the metaphysical and soteriological point of view. The name Siva for the Highest Reality is, therefore, a very happy choice. Siva is the Highest Reality as well as the Highest Good. In addition to Pratyabhijna, Trika, and Spanda, this-system is also known as Saiva-darsana or Bhairava-darsana i.e., the system positing Siva as the all-of-reality-and good. As this system is non-dual, it is sometimes called Kashmirian Saiva philosophy in order to distinguish it from the Saiva philosophy of the South which is dual."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Notes 119 3. Satatam - eternally, may be read with namah or with pancakrtya-vidhayine. In the former case, it would mean 'my eternal adoration to Siva'. In the latter case it would mean 'my adoration to Siva who eternally brings about the five pro­cesses'. The latter construction is better as it indicates that Siva's activity is incessant. 4. Pancakrtya or the five acts brought about by Siva are: -(1) Srsti - Letting go; casting out of oneself. The usual translation 'creation' is misleading. Creation implies that the creator acts upon an external material, and thus brings about the world-process. This translation does not do justice to the Indian point of view, particularly to the point of view of Saiva philosophy. Srsti is derived from the root srj which means 'to let go', to pour forth', 'to project. This implies that the world-process is already implicitly contained in Siva. He only lets it go or projects it out of himself. He has not to work on ar. external material in order to bring about the world-process According to Saiva philosophy, the world is not a creation, but an emanation; it is a theophany. (2) Sthiti - maintenance (of the world-process). (3) Samhara or Samhrti - withdrawal or re-absorption. It does not mean destruction. There is no destruction of the world. It is only re-absorbed by Siva for a time. Destruction is only a metaphorical and secondary sense of samhara, not its primary sense. (4) Vilaya or pidhana - concealment of the real nature of the Self. (5) Anugraha - grace. These five krtyas imply that Siva lets go the universe out of himself, imparts existence to it and finally withdraws it into himself only to let it appear again. This makes a cycle which is called a kalpa. There is no final end to the world-process. The cosmic process is repeated from eternity to eternity. Anugraha is the act of grace by which Siva brings about the liberation of man. The first four krtyas are cosmological, the last is soteriological. The five krtyas are not an artificial mixture of two standpoints - one cosmological and the other soteriologi­cal. Rather anugraha is the raison d'etre of the first four krtyas,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"120    Pratyabhijnahrdayam    it is that for the sake of which the first four krtyas, come into play. It expresses the abounding love of Siva. 5. Paramartha - Parama+artha: Parama means the Highest; artha means both 'reality' and 'goal or value'. Paramartha connotes both the Highest Reality and the Highest value. According to Indian thought, the Highest Reality is also the Highest Value of man. In the realization of the Highest Reality consists the meaning and purpose of human life. 6. Svatma may mean either one's nature or one's self. In the former case, the line 'ciddnandaghana-svatma-paramarthava-bhasane' would mean 'who makes manifest the Highest Reality (which is at the same time the Highest Value) whose nature is cidanandaghana i.e.,.a mass of consciousness and bliss or compact consciousness and bliss. In the latter case, it would mean 'who makes manifest the Highest Reality (which is at the same time the Highest Value), viz., His Self (which is also the Real Self of each individual) that is a mass of consciousness and bliss'. There is a double entendre in svatma viz., His Self (the self of Siva) and the self of each individual, the implication being that His Self is identical with the Real Self of each. This translation is preferable, as it is more in line with the general tenor of this system. 7. Cidanandaghana - mass of consciousness and bliss. In Sarikara Vedanta, the expression used is generally 'saccid-ananda. i.e., sat (existence) cit (consciousness) and ananda (bliss). In this system, sat has been dropped as superfluous, for according to it, cit or consciousness alone is sat or real. Cit and sat - consciousness and existence or reality are synonymous. There can be nothing outside consciousness which may be called existent or real. Saiikara also says, \"Sat eva bodha, bodha evasatta\" i.e., Existence itself is consciousness, and consciousness itself is existence. 8. Upanisat - upa-ni-sad (sit) i.e. sitting down near to or sitting down at the feet of another (i.e., the teacher) to listen to his words. It, therefore, has come to mean rahasya or secret knowledge obtained in this manner. It is equivalent to secret or esoteric doctrine. The word has also been interpreted by Sahkara as 'destruction (of ignorance) by revealing the know-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Notes     121     ledge of the supreme spirit'. Here the word has been used in the sense of'secret or esoteric doctrine'. 9. Sarhkara - Sam karoti iti Samkarah, one who brings about happiness and welfare is Samkara. This is another name of Siva. Samkaropanisat, therefore, means the esoteric doctrine pertaining to Samkara or Siva i.e,, the esoteric system known as Saiva philosophy. 10. Samsdra - Samsarati iti samsarah i.e., 'that which is always on the move'; that which is continuous 'pro-cess'. The word 'world, or universe' can hardly do justice to this idea. Etymologically the word 'samsara' also means 'wandering through' (a succession of states) of the jiva or the individual soul. It is in this sense that samsara is called visa or poison here. It is not the world qua world which is poison, but the 'wandering through' of the jiva as a being disintegrated from Reality, cut off from his Innermost Centre, which is poison. Visa is derived from the root vis of the third conjugation (vevesti), meaning 'to pervade', hence anything actively perni­cious i.e., poison. The root 'vis' in the fourth conjugation (visnati) means also 'to separate, to disjoin'. There may be a suggestion here that samsara is visa because it disjoins us, dis­integrates us from Siva - (the Highest Reality). 11. Samavesa - This is the noun form of sam-d-vis\", mean­ing to enter into. Samavesa, therefore, means mergence or identification. Samavesa with the Highest Lord means identi­fication of the individual self with the Universal Self. The individual, in this state, feels that he is nothing else than Siva. Samaves'a, also means taking po?session of the individual by the Divine. The outcome is the same, viz., identification with Siva. According to Abhinavagupta, avesa means the subordi­nation or disappearance of the personal nature of the aspirant and his identification with the divine nature of Siva. \"Avesasca asvatantrasya svatadrupanimajjanat.

A Sutra must contain the fewest possible words, must be free from ambiguity, must be meaningful and comprehensive, must not contain useless words and pauses and must be faultless. 14. Svatantra - this is an adjective qualifying Citi. This means dependent only on itself and nothing else. It means that it is absolved of all conditions, and is free to do anything it likes.

Suddha adhva is that which is above Maya in which there is no diffe­rence between the knower and the known. Asuddha adhva is that where difference begins right up to the earth.

In this tattva ahanta or I-consciousness and iccha or Will are predominant. Idamta or this-consciousness (i.e. world-consciousness) is not so prominent. It is also called sadakhya tattva, for it is the state in which there is the first notion of 'being' (sat akhya yatah). It is the incipient world-experience. The world is in an indistinct state at this stage. The consciousness of this state is Aham idam - 'I am this'. There is no distinction between I and 'this' (the universe). This is a state of perfect identity. 4. Isvara, i.e. the Lord. In this both I-consciousness and world-consciousness are equally prominent, and jnana or knowledge is predominant. The consciousness of this state is 'Idam aham' - 'This is I' - -the universe is I. The uni­verse has come distinctly into consciousness but still as identical with the Divine Self. This is a state of abheda i.e. non-difference between the 'I'or Self and 'this' or the universe. 5. Vidya or Suddhavidya or Sadvidya pure, unlimited knowledge. In this there is the consciousness - Aham idam ca - 'I am I and also this (universe)'. This state is one of bhedabheda i.e. the universe is a distinct object to consciousness, yet its distinction is overcome in Self-consciousness. It appears only as an aspect of the Self. This is a state of 'identity in difference'. Kriya or action is predominant here. The first five - from Siva to Sadvidya - are called Suddha adhva, because the relationship of subject and object is a single unit upto this stage i.e. the object is per­ceived as a part of the subject; there is no veiling of the Self so far. These five tattvas represent the universal aspect of consciousness. ASuddha adhva or mundane manifestation 6. Maya, the universally formative or limiting principle. Sometimes, this is not included in the Kancvkas, as it is a principle superior to the Kancukas and gives rise to the Kancukas. This veils the real Self and brings about the consciousness of difference and plurality."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124 Pratyabhijndhradayam The Five Kancukas (coverings) of Maya 7. Kala, i.e. limitation in respect of authorship or efficacy. 8. Vidya, knowledge i.e. limitation in respect of knowledge. 9. Raga, inclination, limitation of fulness, giving rise to desires for various objects, e.g., I may enjoy this, I may own that etc. 10. Kala i.e. limitation of eternity giving rise to division of past, present, and future. 11. Niyati - Restriction i.e. limitation of freedom, giving rise to limitation of space and cause. 12. Purusa - when the Divine by his Maya veils His real Self and accepts the status of a limited experient, he is known as Purusa. At this stage the Sarvakartrtva or omnipotence of the Divine is reduced to kala or limited authorship, His sarvajnatva or omniscience is reduced to vidya or limited knowledge; His purnatva or all-fulfilment is reduced to raga or want and desire; His nityatva or eternity is reduced to kala or time-division; His vyapakatva or omnipresence or all-pervasiveness is reduced to niyati or limitation in space or His svatantrya is reduced to cause-effect relationship. The principles from Kala to Niyati are generally known as the five kancukas or coverings, veils of Maya put on by the Divine. 13. Prakrti - the root or matrix of objectivity from Buddhi down to earth. 14. Buddhi, the ascertaining intelligence. 15. Ahamkara, the ego-making principle. 16. Manas, the conceptive consciousness. 17-21. The five jnanendriyas or organs of perception (audition, touch, vision, taste, and smell). 22-26 - The five organs of action (karmendriyas) 27-31 - The five tanmatras i.e. the undifferentiated origins of the five perceptions. 32-36 - The five mahabhutas; the gross-elements, viz., akaia (ether), vayu (air), agni (fire), apas (water) and bhumi (earth). 18. Parapramatr means the Highest Experient. Pramatr means measurer or the subject of experience.- The highest experient is parama-Siva, the highest Siva."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Notes 125 19. Parasakti - the highest Sakti. This is distinguished from the subsidiary Saktis that pervade the universe and bring about all kinds of things. They are various aspects of the highest Sakti. Sakti means divine consciousness or conscious energy which is non-distinct from Siva. It is Siva himself in his active aspect of manifestation and grace. 20. Vimarsa - Vi+mrs The root mrs means to touch. Vimri means to touch mentally. It is a highly technical term of this system. Paramasiva, the ultimate reality is not only prakaSa or luminous consciousness, but also Vimarsa i.e. con­scious of its consciousness. Vimarsa is Self-consciousness or pure I-consciousness of the highest Reality. It is this Vimars'a or self-consciousness of reality that brings about the emergence of the universe (srsti), its manifestation (sthiti) and its withdrawal (samhara) into it again as identical with its joy of pure I-consciousness. Vimarsa assumes three moments, viz., going out of itself (srsti), maintaining its continued existence (sthiti) and then returning to itself (samhara). cf. \"Iha khalu paramesvarah prakasatma; prakasasca vimarsa-svabhavah; vimarso nama visvakarena, visvapra-kasanena, visvasarhharanena ca akrtrimaham iti visphu¬ ranam\". - Parapraveiika, pp. 1-2, Kashmir Sanskrit Series. The entire universe is already contained in the highest consciousness or the highest Self even as the variegated plum­age of the peacock is already contained in the plasma of its egg (mayurdniarasa-nyayena). Vimarsa is the positing of this Self which leads to manifestation. 21. Siva-bhattaraka - The word bhattdraka is the same as bhattara which again is the same as the word bhatta. The word is derived from the root bhat of the first conjugation which means to 'nourish'. The word bhatta or bhattara or bhattdraka literally means 'the lord that nourishes or supports'. The word bhattara or bhattaraka means venerable lord. This has been attached to Siva to show reverence. 22. Nityodita - Nitya+udita. Udita is formed from ud+√i+ kta - that which is gone up, risen. Nityodita is eternally risen. In this system it is generally not the word nitya (eternal) that is used for the foundational consciousness, but nityodita i.e."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"126 Pratyabhijhdhrdayam ever-risen, ever-existent. Nityodita is that which never sets, but is always risen. The foundational consciousness never takes a holiday. Whatever both rises and sets is called santodita', but that which never sets, but is always risen is called 'nityodita!. It is also called nityodita because the system wants to emphasize the fact that the eternal consciousness is •ever active; there is always spanda or vibration in it. 23. Pramatr (lit. measurer), subject of knowledge. 24. Pramana (lit. instrument of knowledge) means of knowledge, proof of knowledge. 25. Prameya (lit. to be measured, measurable) the known or object of knowledge. 26. Baindavi Kala - parah pramata. Vetti iti vinduh (binduh) from the root vid (to know). The highest Self or consciousness which is the knower is known as Bindu. Bindoriyam iti baindavi. Baindavi means 'of bindu', 'pertaining to bindu'. Kala means sakti. Baindavi kala means the power of knowership of the highest Self or consciousness, i.e. the power of Self-conscious­ness. Here it means that power of the Self by which it is always the subject, never the object. In this verse, feet are compared to pramana (means of proof); the head is compared to pramata, the knowing Self. Just as it is impossible for one to catch up the shadow of one's head with one's feet, for the shadow of the head always eludes it, even so is it impossible to know the knower (pramata) by the various means of knowing for the various means owe their own existence to the knower. 27. Samarasa - one having the same feeling or conscious­ness. Samarasya therefore, means identity of consciousness. In Samhara or withdrawal, Citi reduces the universe to sameness with the Highest Reality. The Foundational Consciousness is both the alpha and the omega of the universe. 28. Svatantra - Citi or the divine consciousness is called svatantra, because whether it is srsti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance of the manifestation), samhara (withdrawing or reducing the universe to oneness with herself), she is sovereign i.e. does not depend upon any extraneous condition. 29. ViSva-siddhi may also mean the effectuation of both bhoga (enjoyment of the bliss of real I-consciousness) and moksa"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Notes 127 (liberation). When the absolute free-will of cifi is recognis­ed she brings about real enjoyment as well as freedom from limitation. In this sense also she is the cause of visva-siddhi. 30. Pramdnoparohakramena, by gradual mounting, begin­ning with knowledge etc. From the known or prameya one has to mount to pramana or knowledge; from knowledge one has to mount to the pramdtd or the knower, to the highest Self. All pramanas rest in the pramata, the knower. 31. Brahmavada (the doctrine of Brahman) refers to Sankara-vedanta in which Brahman is said to be nonactive. 32. Darpane nagaravat - Just as a city appearing in a mirror is nothing different from the mirror, but appears as something different, even so the universe appearing in citi is nothing different from it, though it appears as different. 33. Sadasiva tattva may be said to be the first principle of manifestation. Out of the Siva-sakti state emerges Sadasiva tattva where consciousness is of the form, 'I am this'. 'This' (idanta) here refers to the total universe. I (ahanta) refers to the Divine Experient. It is the absolute or universal I. The first consciousness of the absolute in manifestation is, 'I am this'. The 'this' (idanta) or the entire universe is already im-plicity contained in the absolute consciousness, but when it begins to posit the I as the 'this, the 'this' becomes the first glimmer of the universe to be. This is, however, a stage of consciousness where the 'this' aspect is in an incipient, germi­nal form, greatly dominated by the 'I' aspect (ahantdcchadita-asphufa-idantdmqyam) where the visva or universe is both diffe­rent and non-different (parapara rupam) from Sadasiva. In this lccha or Will is predominant. In the consciousness, \"I am this\", existence or being is cleary posited; hence this principle is also known as sadakhya-tattva (Sat = Being). The system now starts giving a hierarchy of individual experients. Correspond­ing to the universal experient or Sadasiva is the individual (mystic) experient, designated mantramahesvara who has realiz­ed Sadasiva tattva and whose experience is, therefore, of the form - 'I am this'. The whole universe is identified with his Self. 34. Isvara tattva is the next stage of manifestation in which the consciousness of an '1' and a 'this' is both equally"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128 Pratyabhijnahrdayam prominent. The ideal universs which is involved in the abso­lute consciousness becomes more clearly defined as a 'this' at this stage. Jnana is predominant in this tattva. Corresponding to this is the individual (mystic) experient known as Mantre-svara who has realized the Isvaratattva, whose consciousness is also of the form 'I am this', in which the universe is no longer an indistinct 'this' but is as clearly defined as the con­sciousness of 'I', and in which the universe is identical with the Self. The consciousness of Sadasiva is 'Ahamidam - 'I am this'. The consciousness of Isvara is 'Idamaham' - \"This am I'. 35. Vidya. or Suddha Vidya is the stage where the con­sciousness of both 'I' (the experient) and the 'this' (the uni­verse) is distinct, and where diversity or bheda begins, though there is unity in diversity at this stage. Kriyd is predominant in this tattva. Corresponding to this, there are the experients called Mantras who see diversity, though it is diversity-in-unity. The Lord who rules over these experients is called Anantabhattaraka. The consciousness of this stage is Idam ca Ahamca or Akam idam ca - the universe as different but also as, belonging to me. At this stage, though the 'this' appears as distinct from 'I', yet it is only an aspect of 'I'. It is distinct from 'I', but not different. Hence the consciousness of this stage is known as Suddha Vidya. 36. Vijnanakala is the experient of the stage below Suddha Vidya but above Maya. Here the experient is devoid of agency; he is pure awareness. His field of experience con­sists of sakalas, and pralayakalas. He has a sense of identity with his field of experience (tadabhedasaram). He is free from Mayiya and Karma mala, but is still subject to Anava mala. 37. In this state, the experient has neither the clear con­sciousness of aham (I) nor of idam (this). His I-consciousness is identical with a void like the void that one experiences in deep sleep. He has the feeling of a vague something which is practi­cally nothing. The Palayakala-pramata is identified with the prakrti at the time of dissolution. Theyogins who have an experience only of the void are also like the pralaydkala-pramata. He is free from Karma mala but is subject to Anava and Mayiyamala. 38. The sakalas are the devas (gods) and jivas (individual"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Notes 129 selves) who have no true knowledge of Self, and whose con­sciousness is only that of diversity. The average human being belongs to this level. The Sakalas are subject to all the three malas - Anava, Mayiya and Karma. 39. The suggestion is that in this state vimarsa is latent; only prakasa is predominant. We may now gather up in a tabular form (seep. 130) the details of the third sutra. From Vijnanakala upto Sakala, there is no presiding deity, because the operation of Mahamaya begins from the stage of Vijnanakala and also because ignorance begins from the Mahamaya stage. 40. Andsrita-Siva-paryaya - anasrita i.e. unrelated to any­thing; lit., whose synonym is Siva who has no objective con­tent yet. This is a state below Saktitattva and above SadaSiva-tattva. This, however, is only an avastha, a state, not a tattva. This refers to that phase of reality where Sakti begins tempo­rarily to veil the Self, and thus to isolate the universe from the Self, producing akhyati ignorance of its real nature. This is why Sakti is said to be 'sva-svarupapohanatmakhyatimayi nisedhavyapara-rupa' (Paramarthasara, p. 10) i.e. Sakti brings about akhyati by negating or isolating the universe from the Self and thus veiling its real nature. The full experience of Self is that in which I and the This or the Universe are one. The loss of this Experi­ence - Whole is samsara; the regaining of this Experience - whole or full Experience of the Self is mukti. 41. Sunyatisunyataya - being as yet more void than the void itself. It is called iunya here from the point of view of objective manifestation, from the standpoint of the negation of the universe, i.e. from the point of view of absence of objective content or objectivity. 42. Triiiromate - the mystical doctrine concerning the three-headed Bhairava. The three heads of god, Bhairava are a symbolic representation of the three Saktis of the Divine, viz., Para, Parapara, and Apara. The Para is the supreme state in which there is no distinction or difference whatsoever between Siva and Sakti. Parapara is that state (of manifesta­tion) in which there is identity-in-disrinction. Apara is that state in which there is complete difference."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"130 Pratyabhijnahrdayam NOTE 39: Details of Sutra 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Tattva 1 Siva Sadasiva.

Sarvadevamayah kayah - the universe is considered to be like a body constituted by all the gods. The gods here symbolize both the pramata and the prameya, all the subjects and objects - the experients and the experienced. Another reading is Sarva-tattva-mayah kayah - the body of the universe is constituted by all the tattvas. 44. Priye - dear one or my dear. The Agama literature is generally in the form of a dialogue between Siva and his consort Parvati. Hence, 'Priye' - O, dear one. 45. Bhairava means the terrible one who destroys the weakness of the lower self. This is the name of Siva. Bhairava is constituted of three letters, bha, ra, and va. The hermeneutic interpretation of Bhairava, therefore, is that 'bha' indicates. 'bharana' - maintenance of the universe, 'ra' indicates 'ravana - i.e., withdrawal of the universe, 'va' indicates 'vamana' -ejecting or letting go of the universe, i.e., manifestation of the universe. Thus, Bhairava indicates all the three aspects of the Divine, viz., Srsti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance) and Samhara (withdrawal). Bhairava has been called 'three-headed', because as stated above in note 42 the three heads are a symbolic representation of the three Saktis of Bhairava, viz., para, parapara, and apara or because the three heads are a symbolic representation of Nara, Sakti, and Siva. 46. It has not yet been possible to trace the source of this verse. The idea in this verse is expressed in the form of a paradox. But what does 'akhyati' - nescience or non-knowledge mean? Does it appear or not? In other words - is it experi­enced or not? If akhyati is never experienced, then it is nothing and only khyati or knowledge remains. If it is said that akhyati does appear (i.e. is experienced), then being khyati or experi­ence, khyati again remains. So khyati or knowledge cannot be eliminated in any case. 47. The reference is to Spandakarika, ch. II, vv. 3-4. 48. Vikalpa means difference of perception; an idea as different from other ideas; differentiation. Vikalpanam (ViSe-sena vividhena kalpanam) = ideating a 'this' as different from 'that', differentiation-making activity of the mind. Vikalpa is the nature of the individual mind (citta) which goes on making differentiation between one thing and another."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"132 Pratyabhijnahrdayam Compare the vivrti of Yogaraja on verse 11 of Paramarthasara of Abhinavagupta, 'Vikalpo hi anyapoha-laksano'dvayam ghajaghata-rupam aksipan, aghatdt vyavacchinnam ghatam niscinoti p. 33, i.e., vikalpa is of the nature of differentiating one thing from another. For instance dividing an experience into jar and non-jar, it marks out the jar from the non-jar, and thus ascertains it as a jar. In Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, (Samadhi-Pada, 9), Vikalpa means a mere fancy which has no foundation in reality. That is not the meaning here. What the objector wants to drive at is this. The nature of the individual mind is differentiation-making, knowing 'this' as different from 'that', whereas Siva or the Universal Cons­ciousness is free of all Vikalpas or differentiating ideas. How-then can you call the individual experient as non-diflerent from Siva, so long as the differentiation-making mind of the indivi­dual lasts? 49. Citta means the individual consciousness. 50. Vijnanakala - See note 36. 51. Vidyapramatrta - the experients of vidya-tattva i.e. Mantras. 52. Sadasiva, ISa, AnaSrita-Siva, see notes 33, 34 and 40. 53. Siva, Sadasiva, ISvara, and Suddhavidya are to­gether known as Suddhadhva - the pure or higher path. Mantra, MantreSvara, Mantra-maheSvara etc. are Suddhadhva experi-ents. Predominance of cit is common to both Vidyapramataras and Suddhadhva-pramataras, but in the former case it is natural, whereas in the latter, it is acquired through the effort of Samadhi. 54. Sunyapramatr, etc. See note 37. The word adi i.e. etc. includes sakalas also. 55. The meaning of the verse is - what is jnana in the case of Siva appears as sattva in the case of lpasu' or jiva (the individual), what is kriya in the case of Siva (the universal, Absolute Consciousness) appears as rajas in the individual, what is maya in the case of Siva appears as tamas in the individual. 56. Sattva, rajas, and tamas are the three gunas which are the chief characteristics of Prakrti, the root principle of manifestation. This has been elaborately described by Sankhya,."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Notes 133 and accepted by practically all systems of Hindu philosophy. Guna means strand, a constituent, an aspect of Prakrti. Sattva is the aspect of harmony, goodness, enlightenment, and sukha or pleasure. Rajas is the aspect of movement, activity, and duhkha or commotion. Tamas is the aspect of inertia, and moha or dullness, indifference. 57. Vikalpa - See note 48. 58. Mayapramata is the experient of the impure path -the sphere of limitation. Mayapramata includes pralayakalas and sakalas. See notes 37 and 38 and the table given on p. 130. 59. Svatantrya is the abstract noun of Svatantra which means one's own rule, not conditioned by any thing outside oneself such as maya. It is the absolute, spontaneous, free will of the divine consciousness, outside the causal chain, the free, creative act of the Universal consciousness. 60. Mala : dust, dirt, impurity, taint; dross. Dross is the best English equivalent. Mala is what covers and conceals and limits the pure gold of divine consciousness. It is of three forms, viz., anava mala, mayiya mala, and karma mala. As used in this system, mala means those cosmic and individualistic limiting conditions which hamper the free expression of the spirit. Anava mala is the mula-mala, the primal limiting condition which reduces the universal consciousness to an anu, a small, limited entity. It is a cosmic limiting condition over which the individual has no control. It is owing to this that the jiva (individual soul) considers himself apurna, imperfect, a sepa­rate entity, cut off from the universal consciousness. The greatness of Siva in this condition is concealed, and the indivi­dual forgets his real nature. The anava mala is brought about in two ways. Bodha or knowledge losesits svatantrya or unimped­ed power, and svatantrya or sakti loses its bodha or inherent knowledge. Mayiyamala is the limiting condition brought about by maya, that gives to the soul its gross and subtle body. It is also cosmic. It is bhinna-vedya-pratha - that which brings about the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the bodies. Karma-mala. It is the vasanas or impressions of actions done by the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas under the influence"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134 Pratyabhijndhrdayam of antahkarana. It is the force of these vasanas that carries the jiva from one life to another.

Vide Note No. 17. 64. Upadhi (up+a-(-dha) lit., some thing placed near, which affects or limits a thing without entering into it as its constituent. 65. Sugata (lit., one who has fared well) is a title of the Buddha. Therefore his followers are known as Saugatas. 66. The Madhyamikas are the followers of the Madhya-maka (the system of the middle way) school of philosophy. They believe in Sunya (lit., void) as the fundamental principle. 67. The Pancaratra or Bhagavata system is the main philosophy of Vaisnavaism. On the origin of Pancaratra, see Sir R.G. Bhandarkar's \"Vaisnavaism, Saivism and Minor Religious systems\". The derivation of the word, Pancaratra is somewhat obscure. Perhaps it refers to some religious rites lasting for five nights. The followers of Pancaratra are here called Pancaratras. 68. The word iprakrti' here does not mean the Prakrti or root-matter of the Sankhyas. Para prakrti here means the highest cause. The followers of Pancaratra system consider Vasudeva both as the material cause and controlling cause of all manifestation. 69. Leidecker believes that parinama here does not mean transformation or change, but the Pancaratras considered jivas, etc. to be the parinama or transformation of Vasudeva. Sankara while criticizing the Pancaratra system in his commentary on Brahmasutra in Utpattyasambhavadhikarana puts its position quite clearly and correctly."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Notes 135 \"Tesam Vasudevah para prakrtir - itare Sankarsanadayah karyam.\" 70. Ksemaraja seems to have made some confusion here. The Pancaratras do not consider \"avyakta\" (non-manifest) as the ultimate source, but Vasudeva who is higher than \"avyakta\"-Sankara puts their position quite correctly in his commentary on Brahmasutras, in Utpattyasambhavadhikarana: 71. \"Sankhyas\" here means 'the followers of Sarikhya\". 72. See note 36. 73. The Vaiyakaranas were the followers of the Gram­mar School of Philosophy that considered grammar as means of spiritual liberation Their philosophy has been described under the heading \"Panini-darsanam\" in Sarva-darSana-sam-graha\" by Madhava. The reference is obviously to Bhartrhari's Vakyapadiya which considers pasyanti as Sabdabrahma or Reality as Vibration. 74-75. The philosophy of Vyakarana considers the Absolute or Highest Reality as \"Sabda-brahman.\" Sabda (word) is to them not something unconscious but consciousness itself where thought and word are the same and are not yet distinguished. Brahman is the eternal word from which ema­nates everything. According to the Trika system, the universe of objects and so also of thoughts and words is always in Parama Siva potentially. This is the stage of the Paravak - the highest word which is yet unmanifest. The next stage is that of Pasyanti which is the divine view of the universe in its undifferentiated form, far beyond human experience. Ksemaraja means to say that the grammarians go only as far aspaiyanti which is con­fined to the stage of Sadasiva but not upto Paravak which alone refers to the stage of Parama Siva. After the pasyanti, there is the madhyama, which marks the next stage of the mani­festation of the universe from undifferentiated mass to differen­tiated particulars. Madhyama, lit., the middle one is thus a link between Pasyanti, the vision of the undifferentiated universe, and Vaikhari, the stage of differentiated particulars, the stage of empirical thought and speech. It is word in a subtle form"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136 Pratyabhijiiahrdayam in the mind or antahkarana. In Vaikhari, the 'word' appears separately from 'thought', and 'object'. 76. The agamas (here' Saiva-Agamas) refer to a group of literature containing the doctrine of the Saivas. 'Agama' means tradition, that which is handed down from generation to generation. 77. By Arhatas (the deserving, dignified) is here meant the Jains. They maintain that the universe consists of 'para-manus' (atoms of matter) which are eternal. They are subject to change or development inasmuch as they assume different gunas (qualities). The Agama quoted means to suggest that Jains consider these gunas as the highest reality they have dis­covered and are unable to go further than the gunas. 78. Pancaratrikas - Vide note 67. 79. The followers of \"tantra\" are known as tantrikas. The word \"tantra\" has been explained in two ways, (1) from the root 'tan' to expand - that in which the principles of reality are expanded, are elaborately described is \"tantra\". (2) from the root \"tantra\" to control, to harness - that which teaches how to control and harness the various forces of reality is \"tantra\". 80. 'Kala' here means 'Sakti' (the divine manifesting power). The reference here is obviously to the Saktas, the worshippers of Sakti. 81. Trika - The Pratybhijha philosophy is known as Trika inasmuch as it describes Parama Siva or Highest Reality as maninesting itself in a group of three (trika), viz., Siva, Sakti and Nara. From 'et cetera' in Trika etc. may be understood Tripura or Mahartha. 82. Paraiaktipata - The grace of the Highest. Saktipata or grace is of two kinds, viz. para (highest) and apara (lower). Parasaktipata or the highest grace connotes the transmuta­tion of the empirical or limited ego into the Fullest Divine Consciousness. Such grace can be imparted only by the Divine. In apara Saktipata (lower grace), though the ego realizes his identity with the Divine, he is yet unable to realize that the entire universe is only a manifestation of himself and has thus not yet obtained the Fullest Divine consciousness of Siva."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Notes 137 Apara Saktipata (lower grace) can be imparted by a spiritual director or gods. 83. Vidya is one of the five Kancukas - the impure know­ledge (asuddha-vidys). It is the principle of limitation which does not allow the individual to have a synoptic view of reality. 84. Turiya, the fourth state of consciousness. In Sarhskrta 'catur' means 'four'. When iyat suffix is added to 'catur', 'ca' is dropped and 't' of iyat suffix is dropped (tur+iya), and thus the word becomes 'turiya' which means 'fourth'. Every man's consciousness is in three states - -jagrat (waking), svapna (dreaming), susupti (deep sleep). These states are exclusive. When a man is in the waking consciousness, he has no dream or deep sleep consciousness. When he is dreaming, he has no waking or deep sleep consciousness. When he is in deep sleep, he has no dreaming or waking consciousness. In every man, there is a fourth (turiya) state of consciousness also which is the witness of the other three states. Turiya is a relative term. It is in relation to the other three states that it is called turiya or fourth. There is no succession in turiya as there is in the other three states. It is ever present as the witnessing conscious­ness of the three states. The ego limited by body, prana and manas has no experience of turiya, although it is always present in him as the background of all the three states. When avidya (the primal ignorance) is removed, - then only man has the experience of turiya consciousness. That is the essence of our con­sciousness which is experienced when the present limitations are transcended. Micro-cosmically, it is the fourth state of consciousness holding together the waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna) and dreamless sleep (susupti). Macro-cosmically, it is the fourth state holding together the three krtyas, of srsti, sthiti, and samhara. \"Srsti-sthiti-samhara-melana-rupa iyam turiya\". Just as a string holds together various flowers in a garland, even so it holds together the other three forms of experience and runs through them all. It is integral awareness. But it is other than the three states of waking, dream and sleep. Hence it is called the fourth. When an individual consciously experiences turiya state, the sense of difference disappears.

So Turiya may be said to be ubhaya-rupa i.e., both full and emaciated. In the highest sense, however, she is anubhayatma, beyond the conditions of fulness and emaciation. 85.

'Brahmavadins' refers to those Vedantists who believe that a principle, called Maya, other than Brahman is respons­ible for srsfi, sthiti and samhara. Literally, it means advocates of the Brahman doctrine. 92. Panca-vidha-krtya - the five-fold act. For details see note 4. In Sutra 10, the five-fold act is described from the epistemological point of view. 93. Suddhetara-adhva - (lit.), (course other than the in­trinsic) i.e., the asuddhadhva, the non-intrinsic course, the extrinsic manifestation: Suddhddhva is the intrinsic or supra-mundane manifestation; asuddhddhva is the mundane or extrinsic manifestation. Sadasiva, Isvara, and Suddhavidya are in the region of suddha-adhva or supramundane manifestation. The tattvas from maya to the five gross elements are in the region of asuddha-adhva, the extrinsic course or mundane manifestation. This has been called asuddha-addhva or impure course, because in this there is a sense of bheda or difference. In Sudha-addhva or the pure course, there is a sense of abheda or non-difference. 94. This is called 'vilaya', because the real nature of self is veiled in this state. 95. In the matter of knowledge, the object known in a way becomes one with the knowing subject. The actual pramiti (knowledge), divested of the accidents, of the prameya (the known object), will be found to be one with the parmatr (the knowing subject). 96. Here the five-fold act is described particularly from the point of view of the esoteric experience of the yogin. From this point of view, abhasana is srsii, rakti is sthiti, Vimarsana is Samhara, bijavasthapana is vilaya, and vildpanais anugraha. For the meaning of abhasana etc., see the Commentary. 97. 'Mahartha' is the esoteric aspect of this system. 98. Vimarsana or camatkara is the experience of 'Ah ! How wonderful!' It is like the delight of an artistic experience; hence it is called camatkara which means an intuitive flash of artistic experience. 99. The knowledge of the object is called samhara here,"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"140 Pratyabhijnahrdayam because the object is withdrawn. The object as an object disappears and only its knowledge remains. 100. Hathapaka : There are two ways by means of which an object of experience is brought to sameness with the real essence of the experient, viz., (1) santi-prasama and (2) hathapaka prasama. Prasama means 'reducing completely the world of experience to oneness with the experient'. The first one is a slow, gradual process: the second, i.e., hathapaka is a dogged, persistent process. It is not gradual. 101. Alamgrasa: alam + grasa : alam means paripurnarupa-taya, nis-samskarataya, i.e., fully perfectly, when no impression or germ of samsara as separate from consciousness is allowed to remain; grasa is grasanam (lit., swallowing) - here it means svatmasatkaranam - bringing it to sameness with the Self. 102. Mantras : 'Mantra' is composed of two letters 'man' and 'tra'. 'Man', implies mananat (by pondering), and 'tra' implies trayate (protects, saves). Mantra, therefore, means that which protects or saves by pondering. Mantra is a sacred word or words which, when properly uttered and meditated upon, become efficacious (in all sorts of ways; here in bringing about liberation). 103.

In this one sentence, the writer has referred to both the viksepa and the avarana aspects of Sakti. 107. Avikalpa is the distinction-less consciousness. It is the opposite of vikalpa. It is mere awareness without a 'this', or 'that'. It is turyatita avastha, a stage of consciousness beyond the turya. 108. Brahmi, lit., means pertaining to Brahma. The other saktis are, Mahesvari, Kaumari, Vaisnavi, Varahi, Indrani, Camunda and Mahalaksmi. There are eight classes of letters. The presiding deity of each is as follows : Deity  Class of letter 1.

The idea is that so long as the soul is in the pasu (bound) stage, the Sakti-cakras( the saktis with their differentiation making hosts) cause to appear the srsti and sthiti - the emanation and maintenance of bheda or difference only, and samhara or com­plete disappearance of abheda or non-difference or one-ness. At this stage, consciousness of difference is created and main­tained, and consciousness of oneness is completely withdrawn. At the pati stage, when bondage of the soul dissolves, the reverse of the previous condition happens. Here the saktis bring about srsti and sthiti, emanation and maintenance of abheda, non-difference or one-ness of all, and samhara or complete with­drawal of bheda or difference Pati stage is of two kinds - (1) anadisiddha eternally present as in the case of Siva and (2) yogi-dasa - that which appears at the stage of yogin. It is the latter which is meant by pati-dasa here. Prof. Leidecker has given a very fantastic interpretation of this. See note 173, pp- 138-39"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"142 Pratyabhijnahrdayam of his translation. The text has been completely misunderstood by him here. It should be borne in mind that at the pati stage, the cakras (the differentiation-making hosts) of the saktis dissolve, and the saktis begin to function in their pure state. In the pasu stage, these are called khecari cakra, gocari cakra, dikcari cakra and bhucari cakra, but in the pati stage, these are called simply cidgaganacari or khecari, gocari, dikcari and bhucari respectively. 110. Bhairava-mudra - This has been denned thus : This is a kind of psycho-physical condition brought about by the following practice : \"Attention should be turned inwards; the gaze should be turned outwards, without the twinkling of the eyes. This is the mudra pertaining to Bhairava, kept secret in all the Tantras.\" 111. Suddha (pure) vikalpa - This is the vikalpa in which the Sadhaka feels - Sarvo mamayam vibhavah - all this glory of manifestation is of (my) Self, in which he identifies himself with Siva. It is a total consciousness and the means for passing into nirvikalpa or consciousness free from differentiations. This is called iuddha vikalpa or pure vikalpa, because though it is still vikalpa or mental formulation, it is suddha or pure inas­much as it is a mental formulation of the identity of oneself with the Divine. 112. Mahesata - This is an abstract noun of 'MaheSa' which means the great Lord (Siva). Mahesata or Mahesvarya, therefore, means the power or status of the great Lord, Siva. It connotes the state in which the soul is perfected and identi­fied with Mahesa, the great Lord or Siva. 113. Vikalpas - See note 48. 114. VameSvari - The author here gives the reason as to why this sakti is known as vameSvari. The word vama is connect­ed with the verb 'vam' which means 'to spit out, emit, eject'. The Sakti is called Vamesvari, because she emits or sends forth the universe, out of the Absolute. The word vama also means"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Notes 143 'left, reverse, contrary, opposite'. This Sakti is called Vamesvari also because while in the Siva state there is unity-consciousness, in the state of Samsara, the contrary or opposite condition hap­pens, viz., there is difference-consciousness, and also because every one considers the body, prana, etc., to be his Self. This play on the word vama cannot be retained in the translation. 115. Khecari, gocari, dikcari and bhucari are only sub­species of Vamesvari sakti. Khecari is connected with the pramata, the empirical subject, the limited experient; gocari is connected with his antahkarana, the inner psychic apparatus; dikcari is connected with the bahiskarana, the outer senses; bhucari is connected with the bhavas, existents or outer objects. These Sakti-cakras indicate the processes of the objectification of the universal consciousness. By khecari cakra, one is reduced from the position of an all-knowing consciousness to that of limited experient; by gocari cakra, he becomes endowed with an inner psychic apparatus, by dikcari cakra, he is endowed with outer senses; by bhucari cakra, he becomes confined to bhavas or external objects. Khecari is one that moves in kha or akasa. Kha or akaSa is, here, a symbol of consciousness. The Sakti is called khecari, be­cause her sphere is kha or consciousness. Gocari is so called, be­cause her sphere is the inner psychic apparatus. The samskrta word 'go' indicates movement, and thus light-rays, cow, senses are known as 'go', because they are connected with movement. The antahkarana is the seat of the senses and sets them in motion; it is the dynamic apparatus of the spirit par excellence. Hence it is said to be the sphere of gocari. Dikcari is literally the Sakti that moves in dik or space. The outer senses have to do with the consciousness of space. Hence the outer senses are said to be the sphere of dikcari. The word bhu in bhucari means 'existence' (world). Hence existent objects are the sphere of bhucari sakti. The empirical individual experient, his psycho­physical powers, and his objects of experience have all been described here as expressions of various Sakti-cakras. 116. There are three aspects of antahkarana, viz., buddhi, ahamkara and manas. Buddhi ascertains; ahamkara brings about identification of he Self with the body etc., and assimilation of"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"144 Pratyabhijndhrdayam experience with oneself, and manas determines a thing as this or that. 117. aisvaryaiakti is the sovereign power of the Lord.

Regarding the distinction between prakasa and vimarsa, see note 20. 120. prana, apana, samana Saktis. There are five pranas - prana, apana, samana, udana, vyana. These are, however, vayus or vital airs. Pranas are the vayus that carry out the functions of vegetative life. They are distinct from the body. Like vitalism, Indian philosophy maintains that life is something different from mere matter. Life is main­tained by various pranas. Breath is the most palpable and con­crete expression of prana. Prana is a comprehensive word covering all the functions of vegetative life. It is, however, divided into various divisions according to various functions. Roughly, prana is the vital vayu that goes out, apana is the vital vayu that goes in downwards towards the anus. Samana is the vital vayu that is said to be located in the interior of the body. It helps in assimilation of food, etc. Hence it is known as samana. Vyana means going in all directions. It is everywhere in the body. 'Udana' means 'going upward'. Here the word Saktihas been used, not vayu. The various vayus are the functions of the various Saktis of the same name. By means of prana, apana and samana Saktis, one becomes a bound soul (pasu) ; by means of udana and vyana Saktis. one is freed, becomes pati. 121. Kals means organs or phases, here those phases which bind the soul to the world. 122. Puryastaka. This is a synonym of the suksmasarira, the vehicle of the samskaras which is not cast off at death like the sthula Sarira or the physical body. 'Puri' means a city and as takam means a group of eight - puryastaka meaning the city of the group of eight. This group of eight consists of the five tanmatras, manas, buddhi, and ahathkara. 123. Udana sakti. It is the sakti which appears when prana and apana become equally balanced. Udana then becomes"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Notes 145 active, moves up through the madhya-dhama or susumna and brings about the turya or fourth state of consciousness. 124. madhya-dhama is the middle nadi or susumna. There are two nadis running in a parallel way on to the susumna. They are not physical but pranic, and are known as ida and pingala. Prana flows through the ida and apana flows through the pingala. Susumna. is a pranic nadi running up inside the spinal column towards the brain. Normally the prana and apana Saktis alone are active. When, however, through the practice of yoga, prana and apana currents are equilibrated the susumna nadi be­comes open, and the udana current flows through it and brings about the turya state of consciousness. 125. Turya literally means the fourth. The word catur means four. The word turya is formed by catur+ yat in which ca is dropped and only tur remains and t of the suffix yat is drop­ped. So we have tur+ya= turya meaning the fourth. Normally man's consciousness functions only in three states, viz., waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), and dreamless sleep (susupti) When uddna sakti becomes active in the madhya-dhama or susu-mnd, one develops the consciousness of turya or the fourth state in which one has unity-consciousness and the sense of difference disappears. This consciousness is full of bliss. In the first or waking condition, the body, prana, manas and senses are active. In the second or dreaming condition, the prana and manas alone are active. In the third or the state of deep sleep, even the manas stops functioning, and atman or pure consciousness is in association with mere void. In the turya or fourth state, atman is detached from these limitations, and remains pure consciousness and bliss (ciddnandaghana). Our Waking, dream and deep sleep states, are detached from each other i.e. during waking state we do not have the dream and deep sleep consciousness; during dream state, we do not have the waking and deep sleep consciousness; during deep sleep state, we do not have the waking and dream conscious­ness. When we are in one state, we are not aware of the other two states, but turya is integral awareness i.e. it is always aware or conscious of all the three states; it is not cut off from any of the states. When turya awareness is established, the habit of manas, viz., of knowing things in parts or snippets, of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"146 Pratyabhijnahrdayam departmentalisation in awareness is reduced. Turya is a consciousness which is aware of all the three states: waking, dream and deep sleep. It is not under the influence of maya which brings about a sense of difference. Turya or fourth is a relative word. It is called turya or turiya (fourth) with reference to the three states of waking, dreem and deep sleep. The three states of waking, dream and deep sleep do not disappear, only the turya or the fourth awareness is always aware of all the three states; it is not cut off from any of the three states. Though running through all the three states, the turya is unaffect­ed by them, for it is completely free from any impression of subject-object duality, being pure consciousness and bliss; hence while running through them all, it transcends them all. Gf. Yogaraja's commentary on verse 35 of Paramarthasara : ''Turiyam grdhya-grdhaka-ksobha-pralayasamskara-parikaayat jndnaghanaprakasanandamurti; atah tadantahsthamapi tdbhyo 'vastha-bhyah cinmayataya samuttirnatvdt'param' anyat-iti\" (p. 80). 126. Vyana-Sakti - Macrocosmically it pervades the en­tire universe and microcosmically it pervades the entire body when the kundalini becomes, awakened, and brings about the turydtita condition. 127. Turyatita means transcending the fourth state. lt is a state beyond the turya. Turya is turiya (fourth) in relation to the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep; but in turyatita, the above three states as separate states disappear. Hence when the three states have disappeared, tarya can no longer be called turya. It is called turyatita in which the turya or fourth state has been transcended. It is a state where pure consciousness is like an ocean without any ruffle whatsoever, and is full of bliss. It is the consciousness of Siva himself or one who has reached that stage in which the entire universe appears as his Self. In turya, manas becomes attenuated; in turyatita it is dissolv­ed in sakti. When the turya state becomes fully developed and reaches perfection, it is transformed into turyatita state. In this state, everything appears to the individual as Siva or Self. 128. pati - This refers to the condition in which the individual soul realizes his identity with the universal Self or pati or Siva."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Notes 147 129.

Citta means the limited individual consciousness, the psychological status of the individual. 132. Citi means the universal consciousness, con­sciousness in its initial, unconditioned state.

Since in this system, Siva is mostly the term used for the Absolute, Indra has been substituted for Siva in the trinity. 136. This is a quotation from the Spandakarika (II, 10) of Vasugupta. The full verse is as follows : i.e. the mantras having resorted to that power (of citi) alone acquire the power and efficiency of the all-knowing (i.e. Siva) and then proceed to carry out their specific functions even as the senses of the individual (carry out their specific functions by the power of the individual, not by themselves). 137.

Prana-Sakti here means the primal energy, not pranavayu or the breath of that name. The transformation of consciousness into prana is a step towards its progressive materialization. This prana is also known as mahaprana. 141. 'Madhya: Madhya-nadi, - Madhya from the point of view of Sambhu or Siva, is the universal consciousness which is the innermost or central reality of all existence, it is the pure I-consciousness of Siva. From the point of view of Sakti, it is jnana-kriya - knowledge and action - the spiritual urge which expresses itself in knowledge and action. From the point of view of anu or the individual, it is the madhya-nadi. Madhya-nadi : Madhya or madhyama nadi is the susumna-nadi which is in between ida and pingala nadis. The word nadi is derived from the root nad (bhrans) - to fall, drop. That through which something drops or flows is nadi. The nadis are subtle channels of prank energy. Madhya or madhyama nadi is so called because it is centrally situated. It is also called susumna. The derivation of the word susumna is somewhat uncertain. Accor¬ ding to Sabdakalpadruma 'su su' ityaoyaktasabdam mnayati i.e.that which repeats the indistinct sound su su may be its derivation. Susumna is situated in the interior of the cerebro-spinal axis or Merudanda. It extends from Muladhara to Sahasrara. Within the 'fiery red' Tamasika Susumna is the lustrous Rajasika Vajra or Vajrini Nadi and within the Vajrini is the pale Sattvika Citra or Citrini. It is the interior of the Citrini which is called Brahma-nadi. Susumna is said to be fire like (Vahnisvarupa) ; Vajrini is said to be sun-like (suryasvarupa); Citrini is said to be moon-like (candrasvarupa).

According to Tantra, there are cakras or centres of prana located in the prand-maya-kos'a. These are called cakras, because they are like a wheel in appearance. They absorb and distribute prana or vitality to the pranamaya-kosa, and through it to the physical body.

Unity consciousness that began in turya is consummated in turyatita in which the whole universe appears as the Self. See Isvarapratya-bhijna-vimarsini, Vol. II, pp. 246-247.

When she rises from one-three-fourths of the folds, goes up through susumna, crosses Lambika and pierces Brahmarandhra, she is known as Urdhva-kundalini and this pervasion of hers is known as vikasa or visa. Lambika is the pranic cross-road of four pranic channels, near the palate. The first two channels are for the flow of prana for all the jivas. The third channel is that through which the yogin rises from muladhara by means of urdhva-kundalini to Brahma­randhra as described here. The fourth channel is for those accomplished yogins whose pranavayu rises directly to Brahma­randhra without having to pass through muladhara. 157. Adhah-kundalini. Its field is from Lambika down to one-three-fourths of the folds of kundalini lying folded in the muladhara. Prana goes down in adhah-kundalini from Lambika towards muladhara. This is known as sankoca or vahni. 158. Sastha-vaktra. Prof. Leidecker translates vaktra as mouth, and thinks that 'sixth mouth' is unintelligible. Vaktra in this context does not mean 'mouth'. It means here simply organ. The ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and the anus are, in this system, known as panca-vaktra or five organs and medhra-kanda near the root of the rectum, which is below muladhara is the sastha-vaktra, the sixth organ. 159. Vahni-visa: Vahni refers to adhah-kundalini and visa to urdhva-kundalini. The entrance into the adhah-kundalini is sankoca or vahni; rising into urdhva-kundalini is vikasa or visa. Vahni is symbolic of prana vdyu and visa of apana vayu. When prana enters the susumna and goes down into adhah-kundalini or muladhara, then this condition is known as vahni. Entering into the full portion of the root and half of the middle of adhah-kundalini is known as vahni or sankoca. Vahni is derived from the root 'vah' to carry. Since prana is carried down upto mula-dhara in this state, it is called vahni. In Sanskrit, vahni means 'fire'. In this sense also, the root meaning of 'vah' - to carry is implied. Fire is called vahni, because it carries the oblations to the devas (gods).

It is derived from the root 'vis' to pervade. Visa, therefore, refers to prasara or vikasa. Poison is also called visa because it pervades the whole body. What is meant to be conveyed is that when the prana and apana enter the susumna, the citta or individual consciousness should be stopped or suspended between the vahni and visa or in other words between the adhah-kundalini and the urdhva-kundalini. Vayupurna - full of vayu means that the citta should be restrained in such a way that vayu may neither pass out through the nostrils nor through the male organ and the anus. Citta and vayu are inter-connected. Restraint of one brings about the restraint of the other. 160. Smarananda (bliss of sexual union). When the citta can be restrained between the adhah and urdhva kundalini in this way, then one has the joy of sexual union. This is 'inverted' kama. Sexual union is external; this union is internal. 161. This refers to the yogic practice of the school. Perfection is accomplished by the development of \"madhya\" which in the case of ana or the individual jiva means the deve­lopment of prdna-sakti in the susumna which is in the madhya or between the ida and pingala nadis. One way of the development of madhya is the sankoca and vikasa of the Sakti. The literal trans­lation of sankoca and vikasa can hardly do justice to the yogic practice indicated by these. Sankoca connotes the following discipline. Even while mind is going forth towards external objects by means of the senses, even while the senses are actively functioning in grasping form, colour, sound, smell, etc., attention is withdrawn from them and turned towards the inner reality which is the source and background of all activity. Vikasa means concentration on the inner reality even while the sense-organs are quite open, e.g., the practice of the bhairavi mudra. Sankoca implies withdrawal of attention from external objects; vikasa implies concentration of attention on the inner con-sciousness and not allowing it to go out at all even when the eyes, ears, etc., are open to their respective objects. It means"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Notes 153 remaining steady within like a gold pillar, even while the senses are directed towards their objects. Sankoca and Vikasa have to be further developed by the technique of prasara-visranti at the level of urdhva-kundalini. Prasara is, here, practically synonymous with vikasa and visranti with sankoca. The yogin develops the prana-sakti in the susumna, and by restraining it between the eye-brows, he attains to urdhva-kundalini level. Here he practises prasaravisranti. This practice of sankoca and vikasa has to be developed in adhah-kundalini also. Entering completely into the root and half of the middle of adhah-kundalini is known as sankoca or vahni, and entering into the remaining half and wholly into the tip of the adhah-kundalini right up to the position where the urdhva-kundalini ends is known as vikasa or visa or unmilana samadhi. 162. anacka : aca = a, i, u, r, 1, e, o, ai, au, i.e., all the vowels; 'anacka' is sounding ka, ha, etc. without the vowel. The real meaning of the yogic practice of anacka sounding is to concentrate on any mantra back to the source where it is unuttered. 163. Leidecker has given a very confused translation of this verse. The following points have to be noted in this verse. This is in praise oijagadamba - the world-mother; 'tava' (your) refers to 'jagadamba'. 'Anackaka.. cchido'; 'vidhrta-cetasah', and 'adritandhatamasah' are compounds qualifying 'hrdaya-pankajasya'. 'Vidyankuro' is connected with 'tava'. Or 'adritandha-tamasah' may be taken, as qualifying 'tava'. 164. dvadasantah = a measure of twelve fingers; literally, it means the end of twelve fingers. 165. The prana starts at the point of hrdaya (pranollasa which here means the centre of the diaphragm and ends (visranti) ati dvadasanta, i.e., at a distance of twelve fingers from the point between the two eye-brows. Apana (v5yu) starts from dvadasanta (distance of twelve fingers), and ceases at hrdaya (centre of the diaphragm).' Nibhalana'means fixing the citta or mind at the start of prana at the heart, and at its cessation at a distance of twelve fingers from the centre of the eye-brows and at the start of apana from dvadasanta and its cessation at hrdaya. This is like the pranapana smrti (panapana sati) of Buddhist yoga. This is known as sakti-dvadaSanta, or kaundalini."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"154 Pratyabhijnahrdayam There is another dvadasanta, over the crown of the head which is known as Siva dvadasanta or prakriyanta. 166. 'Beautiful one' refers to the devi (the goddess). This is addressed to the devi. Most of the mystic teachings in this system are in the form of a dialogue between Siva and the Devi (goddess). 167. unmesa (lit., unfolding) is a technical term of this-yoga. Only half of the verse has been quoted in the text. The full verse is as given below\". Eka-cinta prasaktasya yatah syad aparodayah, unmesah sa tu vijneyah svayam tarn upalaksayet. This means while one is engaged in one thought and an­other arises, then resting mentally at the junction point between the two is known as unmesa. One can see that for oneself. The nature of mind is to pass successively from thought to thought, but if one rests mentally immediately after one thought and just before another thought arises, one develops the quality of unmesa. It means resting in the spanda between two thoughts or images, i.e., resting in the consciousness which is the back­ground of both the thoughts or images. It is the unfoldment of the creative nature of the Supreme. This is the explanation according to Saktopaya. According to Sambhavopaya, the emergence of the param-arthika bhava or the highest reality, while one is engaged in medi­tating on the object of one's devotion is known as unmesa. 168. Three methods have been recommended here for rising to the highest bliss by concentrating on aesthetic enjoy­ment, viz., (1) asvdda-dharana, concentrating on the savour of eating and drinking, (2) sabda-dharana, concentrating on the aesthetic enjoyment of music, and (3) manastusti-dharana, con­centrating on whatever pleases the mind. 169. For the meaning of samavesa, see Abhinavagupta : - Tantraloka I, 173 Avesa or Samavesa means mergence of the helpless, limit­ed self into and becoming identical with Supreme Siva who is"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Notes 155 at one with the primal Sakti. Samaveaa means subordinating one's limited nature, and acquiring the nature of the Supreme. 170. Vyutthana - Literally 'rising'. In yoga, it means coming to normal consciousness after contemplation. 171. Nimilana-samadhi is the inward meditation with closed eyes in which the individual consciousness is absorbed in the universal consciousness. In this even the trace of object as object disappears and it becomes one with cit. This is real introversion or antarmukhata, and leads to full I-consciousness or purnahanta. 172. Krama-mudra or Mudra-Krama. This is defined in the text itself by the Krama-sutra. In this, the mind swings alter­nately between the internal and the external. The internal appears as the universal consciousness, and the external no longer appears as merely the world, but as the form of Siva or universal consciousness. Mudra, here is not used in its ordi­nary sense of certain postures and positions of fingers, etc. The sense in which it is used here is given further on in the text itself. 173. samvit-devata-cakram - From the macrocosmic point of view, the samvit-devatas are the khecari-cakra, gocari-cakra, dik-cari-cakra, and bhucari-cakra described earlier. From the microcosmic point of view this consists of limited knowership, interna] and external senses, and limited objective knowledge. 174. Kalagnyadeh carama-kala-paryantasya - From Rudra known as kalagni-bhuvanesa in Nivrttikala i.e. the lowest phase of manifestation upto the highest phase of manifestation known as Santa-kaia. Kala here means phase of manifestation. See the chart of manifestation on p. 156. 175. para-bhattarika here refers to the highest vimarsa. There are three kinds of vimarSa, viz., para, apara and parapara. Para is the vimarsa of Siva in which there is abheda or complete non-difference between 'I' and 'this', 'knower' and 'known'; apara is the vimarsa of and or the empirical individual in which there is bheda or difference between 'I' and 'this', knower and known; parapara is the vimarSa of sakti in which there is bhedabheda in which the difference between 'I' and 'this' is posited and for ever transcended."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Vide Note No. 174 KALAS AND BHUVANAS ACCORDING TO ABHINAVAGUPTA EXPLANATORY NOTE ON THE DIAGRAM The whole manifestation is divided into five Kalas or phases. The lowest is: 1. NIVRTTI-KALA. It is formed mainly of prthvi tattva and has 16 bhuvanas or planes of existence. The lowest plane of Nivrtti Kala is called Kalagni rudra-bhuvana. It is this bhuvana that Ksemaraja refers to in 'Kalagnyadeha'. 2. PRATISTHA KALA. This is the second Kala counting from the lowest Kala, viz., Nivrtti Kala. This consists of 23 tattvas, from jala - tattva upto prakrti tattva, and contains 56 bhuvanas. 3. VIDYA KALA. This third Kala contains seven tattvas from purusa tattva upto maya tattva, and 28 bhuvanas. 4. SANTA KALA. This fourth Kala contains three tattvas, viz., Suddha Vidya, Isvara and Sadasiva, and 18 bhuvanas. 5. SANTATITA. KALA. This fifth Kala is comprised of only Siva and Sakti tattvas and has no bhuvana. Parana Siva transcends all Kalas. The total of bhuvanas is 16+56+28+18 i.e. 118."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Notes 157 176. Camatkara is the wonderful joy of creativity. Here it means aham-vimarsa - the bliss of perfect Self-consciousness i. e. the bliss of the consciousness of the entire manifestation as I. This aham-vimarsa is the result of the feeling of one-ness of being with prakasa (consciousness-existence). Regarding prakasa and vimarsa, see Note 20. The ultimate is prakasa-vimars'a-maya. It is both the universe in its manifested and unmanifested state * and also its permanent substratum. 177. Ksemaraja gives here the ascending stages of reality. The first is samvedya or prameya i.e. the known. The second is samvedana or pramana i. e. knowledge. The third is the pramata or the experient who has self-consciousness. The fourth and deeper stage of reality is that of Sadasiva whose consciousness is not identified with the limiting adjuncts of body etc., but whose body is the whole universe. The highest stage of reality is Mahesvara whose consciousness of Self is inclusive of entire manifestation and identical with his prakasa. 178. Jagadananda is a technical word of this system and means the bliss of the Self appearing as the universe. The universe in this system is not a fall from the bliss of the Divine; it is rather the bliss of the Divine made visible. Cf. the follow­ing verses of Abhinavagupta: - Tantraloka, V. 50-51. That in which there is no division or limitation, for it flashes forth all round, in which the consciousness is intact, i.e. in which it is consciousness alone which expresses itself whether as knower or means of knowledge or as known, that which in­creases and expands by the nectar of divine joy of absolute sove­reignty in which there is no need for imagination or meditation. Sambhu told me that that was jagadananda. The commentator says :"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"158 Pratyabhijhdhrdayam That is jagaddnanda where the universe appears as a visi­ble form of the bliss of the Self. Sambhu referred to in the above verse was the chief guru of Abhinavagupta in Trikasystem. 179. According to Tantra there is a correspondence between the para-Sakti, the ultimate divine creative power which brings about the sum total of all objects and the paravak which is the ultimate divine word, the source of the sum total of words. By means of mantras which consist of words or letters, one can establish contact with the various saktis. Every word is a vacaka or indicator and every object is vacya or the indicated. The vacya or object is nothing but the intent of the divine word, the divine word made visible. The divine words or letters are, however, a-mayiya out of the scope of maya. Words are of two kinds, viz., mayiya (pertain­ing to maya) and a-mayiya (not pretaining to maya). Mayiya words are those on which the meaning is imposed by conven­tion; they are vikalpas or fancied constructions; a-mayiya words are those which are nirvikalpaka, whose meaning is just the real, which do not depend on fancy, imposition, supposition or convention, which are cinmaya. 180. akula: - \"kulam saktiriti proktam, akulam Siva ucyate\" (Svacchanda tantra) i.e. kula is Sakti and akula is Siva. Kula (total) or the entire manifestation is sakti. One who is not lost in this total (manifestation) is akula i.e. Siva. The letter 'a' from the point of view of matrka-cakra is of the nature of Siva. 181. pratyahara here does not mean 'withdrawing the citta from the elements', as Prof. Leidecker makes out in his note, 227. The word 'pratyahara' has been used here in the technical sense of Sanskrit Grammar which means the 'comprehension of several letters or affixes into one syllable, effected by combin­ing the first letter of a sutra with its final indicatory letter.' Thus the pratyahara, 'ac' means a, i, u, r, 1, e, o, for it combines the first letter 'a' and the final indicatory letter 'c' of the following sutras -So here the pratyahara of a the first letter, and 'ha' the final letter would be 'aha', which suggests 'aham', meaning 'I' or Self. 'Aha' includes all the letters of the Sanskrit language, and since each letter is indicative of an object, 'aha' suggests the sum-total of all objects, viz., the universe. The entire"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"-Motes 159 universe lies in the highest Reality or Mahesvara in an undiffer­entiated state. 182. bindu : This means a drop, a dot. In the definite calm of the Highest Reality (anuttara), there arises a meta­physical Point of stress. This is known as bindu. In this, the universe to be, lies gathered up into a point. This bindu is known as ghanibhuta Sakti - the creative forces compacted to a Point. It is as yet undifferentiated into objects. It is the cidghana or massive consciousness in which lie potentially in an undifferentiated mass all the worlds and beings to be manifested. Therefore, the text says that 'a' and 'ha' joined into 'aha', and thus together summing up the entire manifestation lie undiffe­rentiated into a Point in the Highest Reality. A point is indicative of non-differentiation. From the point of view of language, the 'bindu' in Sanskrit is indicated by atiusvara - the nasal sound marked by a dot on a letter. Bindu is thus the anusvara, and this completes 'aha' into 'aham' • This anusvara, after having joined, 'a' and 'ha' in oneness shows that all manifestation though appearing emanated and different is actually residing in Siva, and is not different from him. 'A' respresents Siva; 'ha' represents Sakti; the anusvara represents the fact that though Siva is manifested right upto the earth through Sakti, he is not divided thereby; he remains undivided (avibhaga-vedanatmaka-bindu-rupataya). 183. 'mahdhrada' - the great or deep lake refers to the Supreme Spiritual awareness. It has been called a great or deep lake, because it is clear, uncovered by anything, infinite and deep. 184. Cakravarti has a double sense here - (1) rulerr of the •cakra i.e. circle or group of sense-deities and (2) universal sovereign. 185.
