Valmiki MaharshiisAdi kavi.[The first ever writer] Since then many versions of Ramayanalike Kamba Ramayana, Rama CharitaManas, Adhyatmik RamayanRamayana Kalpa Vruksham have been written by many authors. No epic isan equivalent to Ramayana. No story is there in the world without thetouch/mention of The Ramayana. Hence it is Adi Kavya, the prime story inthe world. Atheists also keep remembering Rama in the name of abusinghim. Kamsa also had attained salvation by remembering the Paramatmaeven in his dreams with the feeling of enemity. Such is the compassion ofthe Paramatma.Anjaneya is very powerful. The power which keeps us moving is Anjaneya.Forgetting Ramayana is a Sin! It is equal to forgetting one’s own mother.Rama has born as a Human to show how a human should behave in his life.He is the role model of the human race and called Purushottama. He led alife likea man and only in two incidents he had shown his Lila. OnceAtthat time when the demons Khara and Dushana came to wage a war toinstill faith in Sita Mata,Rama’s weapon had destroyed all fourteenthousand demons at a time. Another time, when Parasu Rama hadchallenged Rama to take his Vishnu Dhanussu (bow) Rama by touching thebow had squeezed the power of Parasu Rama through the bow.Here Ramahad shown “Vaishnava Maya”."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage7Ramasaid that by listening to the story of Rama, all the ailments areremovedandpeace of mind establishes!. The mention of the story of Ramais in the Vedas. Vedas have visualized the story of Rama way before it hadhappened. Ramayana had given us Anjaneya through SundaraKaanda.Anjaneya Swami was the witness of the Story of Rama. Anjaneya wantedto write Ramayana and started to carve the story on stones with his nails.After the completion he piled them up in his cave. Sage Valmiki had heardabout it and went to see the The Ramayana written by Anjaneya!.Anjaneya Swami lived through the story andwrote astonishinglywell.Valmiki had felt that it was superior to TheRamayana written by Him.Anjaneya had observed his feelings and destroyed the stones by throwingthem into the valley. What a sacrifice!Poet Viswanadha Satya Narayanawrote “Ramayana Kalpa Vruksham”. Somebody asked him why he hadwritten Ramayana while so many versions of Ramayana are available. Hehad answered that Ramayana is as essential to the mind as is the food toour body which we consume everyday and a number of times. Such is thenecessity of TheRamayana. Ramayana is the life.

The firstmeeting between Hanuman and Rama. Without this incident, there is noRamayana.Hanuman is known for His devotion to His Mother Anjana Devi. As per Herinstructions, Hanuman becomes a disciple of the Surya, learning from Himall through the 24 hours holding the wheel of the chariot, with His faceinside the chariot. With this deed, Hanuman taught the world as to how adisciple should work hard to acquire knowledge and the commitment withwhich adisciple is supposed to learn.[sishyavrithi]After graduation, Hanuman asked His Mother as to what He was supposedtodo!Anjana Devion the spot instructed Him to be with Sugreeva!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage14“What should I do?” asked Anjaneya!“Meditate upon Rama Nama” Said Anjana Devi. She instructed Him to getimmersed in‘Ajapajapa’ of Rama Nama! Hanuman performed Ajapa japaso vigorously that aprotective kavacha was formed around Hanuman.Sugreeva’s brother was Vali. Vali dominated and threw Sugreeva out, afterthey fought several times. Anjana Devi assured Hanuman that Rama wouldmanifest andgrace Hanuman if he stayed with Sugreeva.S ugreeva withHis fellow friends and Hanuman was staying on a mountain, calledRishyamuka mountain. Rama after punishing Maaricha, the demonhadcame back to Cottage wherein He did not find Sita! Rama wasastonished and shocked. Rama sniveledfor Sita looking at which, all theanimates and inanimates started crying. That was the grief of Rama. Ramaand Lakshmana walked towards Rishyamuka mountain. Sugreeva wasalways awe stricken for the fear of Vali. Whoever went towards themountain, Sugreeva woul be alerted and scared.For the first time then, Hanauman spoke: “Why o you need to fear, whenmy presence is here”??? Hanuman said that Sugreeva was showing Hisoriginal characteristic that is monkey’s way of thinking. Sugreeava wasscared whether Vali sent somebody to kill Sugreeva. Sugreeva confessed thathe was not as strong, powerful and daring as Hanuman. Sugreeva requestedHanuman to go to them in disguise and find out who they were!Sugreeva also requested Hanuma to go there, talk to them to enquire theirdetails and while doing so Hanuman should face Sugreeva, so that byperceiving the feelings ont heir countenance , if it were somebody fromVali’s Kingdom, Sugreeva would run away from there along with his folks.Hanuma went to Rama and Lakshmana in the guise of a “Bikshu” so thathe would be considered harmless by the visitors, whoever they might be."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage15This Samagama is the ultimate and divine chapter, which was very wellwritten and expressed by Sri Tulasi Das Goswami Maharaji Who hadwritten the “Hanuman Chalisa” which we render everyday.Hanuman questions Rama and Lakshmana:Who are you both?, the one who is dark complexioned[Rama] and the otherwho is fair complexioned.[Lakshmana]You look like kshatriyas! But you aredressed like sages. You look so Royal andso delicate too! Your feet are sotender that they cannot withstand the stony and rough floor in this forest.You are not the regular residents of this forest! Are you Thrimurthiescoming in disguise?[Brahma,Vishnu and Maheswara?] Are you NaraNarayanas coming as two ordinary Men? You look like the origin of thewhole creation. You look as though you have come to save people fromthecycle of birth and death. Why do you have to be present here?As Hanuman approached them, Rama could easily make out that he wasnot an ordinary person. Not an ordinary Bikshu.Rama said that he musthave churned the four Vedas; He was well versed and authenticgrammatiaclly too. Rama confirmed that Bikshu was a highly learned andan elevated soul. Rama whispered this matter to Lakshmana.In Valmiki Ramayana it was written that Rama introduced himself askausalya’s son and Lakshmana as His brother and that Rama expressed Hisdifficulties ,about their Aranyavaasam,about His missing wife Sita Mataetc.ButTulasi Ramayana says that Rama questioned Hanuma!!“Who are you? You look like a highly learned person.”Then remembered Hanuma, His Mother’s words that Rama would come toHim and bless Him! Hanuma understood that though Rama could identifyHanuma, Rama was not revealing it to Hanuman, Having understood thatit was for sure Rama,.Hanuma asks Rama!!!!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage16“Swamy!

I mighthave seen you long ago.[Both of them might have seen each other in heavenas Rama inNarayana’s form and Hanumain Shiva’s form.]If you don’trecognize me, who else will recognize me? You are Omnipresent andOmnipotent! You have to call me by my name. I posed a question to yousince I’m ignorant. I do not know anything Listening to all this, Rama isvery much pleased but Hanuma is getting lowered and humble withdevotion and dedication.Hanuma continues.saying that people praise Rama and call Him as “Deenabandhu”,” How can you forget me? I do not know how to praise you.I donot know how to sing in praise of you. I do not know tattva![philosophy]Imeditate upon your Nama so much but I do not anything about you. Youare all pervading yet you pretend as though you do not know me atall!!Hanuman.Uttering these words, he fell at the feet of Rama! Till thenHanuma wasin disguiseof a Bikshu! But once Rama touched Hanuma tolift him up, by touching Hanuma’s shoulders, suddenly,Hanuma got back Hisoriginal form and he is no more a Bikshu.Hanuma realized this and felt very happy. Rama called Him closer and tookHim close to Rama. Rama embraced Hanuma!!This is the ultimate ,divineand very touching scene of”HANUMADRAMA SAMAGAMA”Both of themare fond of each other. Rama said that Hanuma is equal to Lakshmana butagain said that Hanuma is dearer than Lakshmana to Rama and that Ramahas taken this Avatara only for the sake of Hanuma.This is how both ofthem had tears of happiness. Rama’s tears overflew to such an extent thatwith the amount of water of tears, Rama performed Abhisheka to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage17Hanuman. That way, the first ever Abhiheka to Lord Hanuma was performeby Rama. Rama gives a big and warm hug to Hanuma and Hanuma standsat a lower level showing his obedience to Rama [with His one leg bent alittle].His Prabhu.It is a very touching incident of Ramayana.Ramaannounces that though everybody says that God is impartial andSAMADARSI , Ramais abit partial to Hanuma for His Dasa Bhakthi[those who extend physical service]Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji asks everybody to close eyes and visualize the bestever Samagama!!By narrating this divine Samagama, Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji created aRama Bhakthi Samrajyam[Kingdom in which devotion is at its peak forLord Rama.] It is indeed a blessing to all the devotees of DattashramaMachilipatnam, who are rendering physical service with their heart and soulwith untilted faith, warm love and total surrender to Pujya Sri Swamijiand Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji.The person who serves Paramatma should visualize the Paramatma inevery one and in everything. Paramatma is fond of such people. As Ramagave assurance that he would protect His devotees Anjaneya thought that itwould be the apt time to put forth his problems. Vali and Sugreeva werethe two brothers and Vali had driven out his brother Sugreeva from theKingdome along with his three ministers. Anjaneya was one among theMinisters. They were all living on the mountain Rushyamuka. Rama hadassured to help them in gaining back their kingdom.

As it was rainy season Rama asked Sugreeva to sendhis men to search for Sita Mata after four months. Until then RamaandLakshmana stayed in a cave on Prashona Giri.The fifth month had entered as Sugreeva was negligent with his promise ofsearching for Sita. Anjaneya cautioned him and advised him that it is notgood to forget a promise and asked him to serve Rama bysearching forSita. Men were sent in all the four directions and Angada, the prince alongwith Anjaneya, Jambavantha and some elderly and knowledgeable personswent in the south direction. They could not find Sita. All had decided tofast until death as they could not face their king with empty hands.Sampathy the brother of Jatayuvu, the bird lost his life while trying toprotect Sita from Ravana had heard to their words. He felt very sad tohear the death of his brother. He had shown them the path to Lanka whereSita was kept captured. Here Sampathy is in the form of the Guru.Mooladharam is the sea shore. Sea is the water in our body one should crossthe six chakras starting at mooladharam and should reach Sahasrara theLanka with the help of Sadguru. Anjaneya only had the ability to jump overthe sea reach Lanka and return from there. Anjaneya only can help us tocross the six chakras starting from muladhara and reach the Sahasrara.

He was the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage20future Brahma. He was possessed by the Shivamsa. He had the power ofcircling the Earth for hundred times in one second. He could move like thewind. He was the disciple of the Sun. He was born by the penanceperformed by his mother. Gradually Anjaneya’s body had grown to a hugeshape. Jambavantha encouraged Anjaneya to jump over the ocean, reachLanka and to enquire the power of the army there. He asked Hanuman todo the Rama karya. Hanuman had promised to find Sita mata in Lanka.Ifhe could not find her he had promised to pluck Lanka from its place andbring it to them to search for Sita. Other wise he had decided to abductRavana from where ever hewould hide in the three lokas.Anjaneya mounted Mahendra giri which is the symbol of Muladharam; BhuTattva.This is the Yoga Ghattam in Ramayana. The base should be strong totake off like a plane. He had moved on the mountain to prepare himself fortheflight. This represents the preparation before Yoga. The lions on themountain ran here and there. The snakes were quivering standing on theirtails which reminds the flags. Hanuman had selected a place stood there ina huge form. He had promised every one to achieve Rama karyam. Heprayed his Guru Surya Deva. He prayed Indra, Vayu, Brahma and all theBhuta ganas.All his army had promised him to wait for him praying forhim standing on one leg.

Prana Shakthi was stabled and he wasflying over the sea. Hanuman targeted Sahasrara from Muladharam.Thetarget should fixed in the mind. Cautious approach takes you directly toSahasrara. Celestials showered flowers on Hanuman. The Sun is also verypleasant not troubling him.Samudra Devata wanted to help Hanuman.

Hanuman was very happy for his kindness but as he wasunder the oath that he would not rest any where till he reaches Lanka hehad excused himself by gracing Mainaka with touch and proceeded toLanka.Totest his power and his ability of work deities had sent Surasa, the NagaMata. Hanuman had recognized her and requested her to leave him andafter completing the Rama karya he would come to her to sacrifice himselfas her food. Surasa was not ready to leave him. Hanuman had increased thesize of his body and Surasa also had increased her body. Both wereincreasing their bodies and suddenly Hanuman reduced his body entered hermouth and came back. He said that it was Surasa’s wish that who everpasses thatway had to enter her mouth which was done by Hanuman. Shewas very happy with his intelligence and allowed him to pass through thatpath. After going some more distance Hanuman was not able to moveforward. A demon called Simhika could catch any one by grabbing theirshadow. She was pulling Hanuman down. He had increased the size of hisbody and the demon also did so. Both were increasing their bodies andsuddenly Hanuman became so small entered her mouth reached for herheart and broken her heart and cameout. Hanuman had sighted Laka froma distance. He had descended on Lamba Parvata.It symbolizes VishuddhaChakra (throat chakra). Nervous system will be like a mesh. From there thenerves spread to all the parts of the body.

Onlyone who is willing and ready to go through such a drastic alteration canundertake this journey.Hanuman thought, “I have arrived at theislandofLanka. Is that sufficient?No!”Many people say that they have visited Kasi. When they begin to describethe great big Shiva Linga that they have seen there, you know at once thatthey have not really gone there. If they had in fact gone to Kasi,then theyhave not seen Kasi Vishweshwara, because that Shiva Linga is very small.Perhaps there was a huge crowd and all that they could see was the humpon Nandi’s back. They perhaps mistook that to be the Shiva Linga andprostrated to it, and started telling everyone of their visit to Kasi.It is not enough to merely go to Kasi, if you have not had a proper darshanof Lord Vishweshwara. Sitting in the examination hall is not sufficient. Youhave to write the exam, and then get good marks (grade). Onlythen thetask is completed.Hanuman felt that his task was yet to begin. He had to find Sita. She hadbeen missing for ten months. It is not known if she is still alive even. Ramais now testing Hanuman. Without finding Sita, Hanuman cannot return.Onlyafter seeing her, he can decide on what he should do next. Now in hismind, he can only focus on finding Sita as his immediate mission. It is like"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage25focusing on Mother Sri Rajarajeshwari in the Sahasrara Chakra. Hanuman’smind is now fixed on that goal.Only when the Sun rises, darkness vanishes. Only if the messenger’s task isdone properly, success is accomplished. Only then the mission of Rama willbe completed. “I have to think clearly and carefully in order to fulfill mytask”, thought Hanuman.“There are those who are well-versed, and then there are those who thinkthey are, when they are not. There is great danger in dealing with thelatter. One should keep them at a distance. The scholar knows his place, hislimitations. He has discretion. The ignorant one also would be willing tolearn. But the fool, who thinks he is wise, will cause nothing but trouble. Ishould not be one such. My job should be performed wisely and carefully. Itis imperative that I fulfill Rama’s mission.” Hanuman thought hard as tohow to enter Lanka without attracting the notice of the rakshasas, thedemons. Even if he disguised himself as a rakshasa, they would still be ableto detect. Hanuman decided first of all to make himself small andinconspicuous.People ask, “Is therereally a thousand petal lotus at the Sahasrara Chakra?Does a stream of nectar really flow down from there? Are there reallypadukas there? Are all these statements true? If surgically the head isopened up, will they all be revealed?” These are all invisible and subtleconcepts. If one says he is happy, can he show his happiness to you? Can hesell you a kilogram of happiness? Happiness is individualistic, that each onehas to experience. You cannot provide proof. The same way, SahasraraChakra may be described in many different ways, like a lotus with athousand petals amidst which on an island the Mother Goddess resides. Thisis only a description of what really cannot be described in words. It can onlybe experienced. Then why is it described like that?To give people an idea,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage26that is all. For example, Machilipatnam can be described a certain way.Some parts of the city may match that description, and some parts maynot. If someone comes here right after three days of torrential rain when allthe streetsare flooded, and one has to travel on the streets by boat, ofcourse the description would not match the reality.‘Kaakavat Devadatta griham’means, ‘that house with the crow on therooftop is Devadatta’s house’. This description was used to point out thehouse to a new comer who was searching for Devadatta’s house, because atthe time only that house had a crow sitting on it. By the time the newcomer reached the house, the crow had flown away. The man foolishly stoodthere doubting whether it was the right house, because now the crow wasno longer there, it had flown away. The description is only an indication.The crow is not important. The thousand petal lotus is not important. Thefeeling of ecstasy that you experience when you arrive there is important. Ifyou get stuck insisting on finding the one thousand petals, then your searchwould be fruitless.Having decided on his course of action, Hanuman waited patiently for thesun to set. He remained at Trikuta or Lamba Parvata (mountain). SageValmikicalled it Lamba Parvata because it indicates the spot where theLambika Nadi is located. In order to cover that spot for protection, we wearthe dot on the forehead. The scientists have recently discovered that at thetime of death, the life force leaves the body from that spot, making a smallsound. They have recorded the fact. That is why it is important to cover it,not only because it is good for yoga, but also to ward off evil eye. Cover itwith vibhooti, kumkum, or sandal paste. At least for selfish reasons, to wardoff evil eye, please put it on from today. Our scriptures have prescribed itboth for worldly as well as spiritual reasons."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage27Hanuman then assumed the form of a cat. Do you know why?A cat’s body is very flexible like rubber. It can get through even tiny spaces.It has the instinct to know when it is safe to stealthily sneak in and get tothe vessel of milk. It moves very quietly, without making any sound. Weshould also practice walking like that, without loudly stomping our feet ordragging our feet on the ground. Not only is such gait bad for health, it isinauspicious and raises dust.Hanuman jumped. There were many rampart walls around the cityofLanka. He crossed the first one, the one closest to the sea. When hejumped in, he wasimpressed by the sight of the city ofLanka.There are some people who have a hard time falling asleep. There is a secretprocedure that is guaranteed to induce sleep. Lie flat on your back, withouta pillow. Look up. Keep your hands in the area between the stomach andthe chest. Do deep breathing for forty eight times. Do this for 24 days. Ifyou are not cured of your insomnia, come and see me. If it is not cured in24 days, then do it for 42 days. I guarantee relief. That is how powerfulPranayama is.There is another method. Keep your mind focused on the Sahasrara Chakralocated at the top of your head. Imagine as if your eyes are steadilywatching a multicolored swirling light there which is very small, smallerthan a grain of rice. You are sure to fall asleep.Hanuman saw the grandeur of Lanka. He was happy. Yet he was sad tothink that Sita was being held captive there. The city reminded him ofAmaravati, the city ofIndra, or Alakapuri, the city ofKubera. Hanumanbegan his frantic search for Sita. He fervently prayed, “May Mother Sita"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage28give me her darshan quickly”. As if to encourage him, the full moon rose.Hanuman felt happy.When you see something especially beautiful, you should remember all thespecial people in your life, especially your sadguru. Then he appears there. Ithappened to me during the Ganesh nimajjana (immersion in water) in thesea a few days ago.The moon appeared to Hanuman like a silver swan floating across the sky.With his countless rays he seemed to be offering help toHanuman in hissearch for Sita. When one is on a worthy mission, all the celestials will bethere to help.Because of the Sun and the Moon we are able to see the world, we who areunable to see our own eyes without help of a mirror. We think we seebecause of the tube light. It is good to look at the moon every full moonnight. We do not do it. All we want to look at is the television screen.Nature has been created for our benefit. We do not take the time toappreciate it. At least once a year our shastras (scriptures) instruct us toworship the Moon.It is relatively easy to travel from the Mooladhara Chakra to the AjnaChakra. Hanuman has now reached there. But the journey from the AjnaChakra to the Sahasrara Chakra is extremely difficult.Hanumanobserved the mansions in the city ofLanka. They had pillarsmade of crystal. They were gem studded. The sand heaps were heaps of tinypearls. He was amazed at the dazzling beauty of the lavish structures. Allsuch are the temptations that a spiritual aspirant faces during his journey.If his attention gets distracted by these, and he pauses to enjoy these, his"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage29progress will be halted. Hanuman observed and made a note of everything,but moved on, without wasting his time. His mind was fixed on his goal. Heknew that only a few worthy souls such as Sugriva, Jambavan and himselfcould reach this spot.Lankini, the demoness guarding the city ofLankasaw Hanuman. Shestopped him and hit him. Out of compassion that this was a woman,Hanuman gave her a light punch with his fist. She fell down. At once sheremembered the words of Brahma that when a monkey hits her, thatwould be the beginning of the destruction of the city ofLanka. Sherecognized that Hanuman was on a mission for Lord Rama, and that therewouldbe nothing to stop the ruin of Ravana and his city henceforth. Sheprostrated to Hanuman and wished him success in his mission. Hanumanblessed her since she regretted her action performed as duty required ofher. True repentance itself eradicates all sin.It is pointless to dwell on one’spast mistakes. One should genuinely repent, and move on.Having obtained permission to travel beyond the Ajna Chakra, Hanumanproceeded. He entered the enemy territory, wishing them total destruction,by stepping in with his left foot forward, signifying inauspiciousness. Hejumped in, landing on his left foot. He imagined that he was placing his footon Ravana’s head.The main residence of Ravana was wondrous. Hanuman searched every inchof Lanka fully and thoroughlytrying to find Sita. There were rakshasawomen sleeping everywhere in all postures of disarray. He scrutinized hismind to see if he had any bad thoughts. His mind was pure. He was merelydoing his duty."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage30Hanuman noticed that the Vedas were constantly being chanted in Lanka.It concerned him. He wondered how they could succeed in war against thedemons when they had the power of Vedic chanting. But he understoodthat since there was no dharma in Lanka, that the Vedas would not protectthe demons. He knew that the demons would perish.In Tulasi Ramayan there is an attractive description of an episode which isnot found in Valmiki Ramayana. It is the meeting between Hanuman andVibheeshana in Lanka.Far away from Ravana’s house Hanuman noticed a small cottagesurrounded by a Tulasi garden. It looked peaceful and quiet as if it were ahermitage. As Hanuman approached it curiously, the sound of Rama’s namefell on his ears. Hanuman was surprised. For one who is traveling in adesert, even a couple of drops of water will seem like nectar. Apprehensivethat it might be a demonic trick of illusion played by Ravana, he cautiouslygot closer, in the guise of an ascetic. Vibheeshana was inside, devoutlysinging the name of Rama as only a true devotee could. Hanumanstood atthe door of the cottage and began singing the story of Rama, narrating allthe events of Rama’s life in sequence, including how Sita had been abducted,and how he had come in search of her.Vibheeshana got frightened. He thought that his brother Ravana was playinga trick on him. He came out and begged the visitor to reveal his identityafter politely enquiring about his welfare.It is good to study all the different versions of the Ramayana. It enrichesone’s knowledge. Here we are given a chance to see what happens when twoardent devotees meet."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage31Vibheeshana asked, “Are you a devotee of Hari? Your face has such apleasing expression. I am ecstatic to see you. The people of Lanka have sullenexpressions because their minds are filled with hatred. I am stuck in Lanka. Ican neither live here nor leave. Are you Rama himself, come here out ofcompassion for me?”Hanuman simply kept singing. Vibheeshana had goose bumps. Both devoteeswere drowned in ecstasy to see one another. Sri Swamiji’s bhajan, “ReMana, jhoomata gavo Hari ke guna” describes the ecstatic feeling of singingdivine names forgetting oneself.Vibheshana said, “I am like the tongue surrounded by sharp teeth whichmight cut me into pieces at any moment, living here in Lanka.”It is said that once the teeth became proud of themselves because of theirsharpness and cutting edge and tried to show off to the tongue, saying thatit is because of them and their support that the tongue is able to enunciateclearly. The tongue answered,“If I speak foul words, you would be the onesto receive a punch and fall to the ground first, before I do.”Vibheeshana eagerly asked Hanuman, “Does Rama know that I, his devoteeexist? Will he ever come here? Will I ever have his darshan? This body ofmine is born into this totally tamasic (evil) race of demons. I try to fixRama’s divine feet in my heart. But it is so difficult. Now that I have seenyou, I feel confident. I am having your darshan, of a true devotee, a saintlyperson. That in itself isproof that God’s grace is completely upon me.”God himself appears as the sadguru. “Bina Hari Kripa milahi nahi santa” isa common quotation seen in temples in northIndia, which means thatwithout God’s compassion, you will not meet a saint. Sage Narada originally"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage32was the son of a servant maid. He was doing penance. While he was doinghis Chaturmasya deeksha, all the rishis came of their own accord to givehim upadesha and made him a devarshi.Adi Shankara said, “Manushyatvam, Mumukshutvam, Maha PurushaSamaashraya”. It is very difficult to get a human birth. Even after one isborn as a human being, it is very difficult to have the desire for salvation.Even after the desire for salvation arises from within, it is very difficult tofind the company ofa saint.Hanuman now assumed his true form of a vanara, a monkey. Hanumantold Vibheeshana, “Do not be dejected. Be happy. Soon you will have thedarshan of the Lord. The Lord is ever eager to give happiness to hisdevotees.”Does Hanuman need any training in proper speech? He is “Shabda maya,Shastra maya”, a repository of all sounds, all scriptural knowledge. He is anexpert grammarian. He said, “Just look at me. What about my race? I aman ordinary monkey.” See how Hanuman is offering solace to Vibheeshanawho feels like a tongue caught amidst sharp teeth? We are all puppets inthe hands of destiny. Hanuman is belittling himself as a true devotee should,to comfort another. “There is a belief that whoever utters the word‘monkey’ first thing in the morning will starve the entire day,” saidHanuman. Hanuman does not know what ‘ego’ is. “When such a one as Ihave received the Lord’s compassion, why should you worry at all?”Hanuman’s eyes filled with tears of joy. He now felt very relaxed and atease after singing Rama’s story. Vibheeshana also felt happy and comforted.Now Hanuman asked Vibheeshana if he knew the whereabouts of Sita. Hemade a deal with him. He said, “I have seen Father Rama. You know about"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage33Mother Sita. You show her to me and I will show him to you.” Vibheeshanasaid, “I have heard it rumored that Sita is in the secret garden, AshokaVana. I have not seen her. But this is what I have heard. You try to find herthere.” Happily and gratefully Hanuman took leave of Vibheeshana.Vibheeshana reminded him once again about the deal.Hanuman remembered this encounter while in Yuddha Kanda, wheneveryone else advised Rama against giving refuge to Vibheeshana, Hanumanalone spoke in favor of him, and said to the Lord, “ Do what you feel isright”. Because of Hanuman’s words, Vibheeshana was able to surrender atthe feet of Rama.Sometimes the sadguru will test a disciple, asking how something should bedone, or what should be done. It is important to humbly remember one’sposition, and be aware that the sadguru knows everything, and answerwith caution, and not with confident arrogance at being asked for advice orinformation.Now Hanuman wondered how to find this Ashoka Vana, where it might belocated. He thought that it might me inside Ravana’s private residence. Hewent and searched there. He found all kinds of strange chambers there. Hisfather the Wind God came to help him by enticing him with the aroma offood that led Hanuman to a magnificent structure. Approaching itcautiously, Hanuman suddenly stepped back. He observed it closely. It wasnot a house. It was not a gymnasium. It was huge and it was movingslightly. It was supported by countless tiny creatures. It suddenly occurredto him, “Oh this is the Pushpaka Vimana! (an aircraft that never becomesfull, always having room for one more). Sugreeva had told Hanuman aboutit. Ravana had confiscated it from Kubera. It was a scientific marvel. It hadall the luxuries. Hanuman went inside. He went to Ravana’s bedroom. He"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage34saw Ravana lyingthere asleep in bed, like a huge buffalo in a pool of mud,like a black serpent, like a mad elephant, like a heap of black gram dal(black lentils).Do you know why we offer ‘Vada Mala’ to Hanuman, why he is so fond ofit? There are many reasons given inParashara Samhita. One of them isthat because Ravana reminded Hanuman of blackgram. To make VadaMala, you have to first make the vadas. You have to soak and grind theblackgram dal (urad dal) to paste. Then you have to fry the little ringshapes in hotoil. Then you make a garland with them. Hanuman is happyto see Ravana being given this type of treatment and he is happy to wearthat as a garland. Another reason given is that since Hanuman carriedRama’s signet ring to give to Sita, the ring shape of aVada reminds him ofhis first meeting with Mother Sita.In contrast, when Hanuman first saw Rama, he thought of the radiant Sun.Looking at this mighty figure, Hanuman wondered how to defeat thisRavana in battle. Ravana was a great devotee of Shiva. He had receivedmany boons from Brahma. But because of his one evil deed of abductingMother Sita, he had expended all his merit, and had now become veryvulnerable.Hanuman looked around the room. He saw many sleeping women, but nonethat resembled Sita.Finally on a bed far removed from Ravana’s bed,Hanuman found a very noble and virtuous looking lady. She was fast asleep.Hanuman jumped with joy. He had found Sita! He ran around the room inecstasy. He kissed his own tail in happiness. Then he thought,“Wait aminute. How can it be Sita? How can Sita possibly fall asleep? Surely shewould not eat or decorate herself like this, living in captivity. Being"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage35separated from Rama, she would be grieving. She would not be sleepingpeacefully, and definitely notin Ravana’s bedroom. There is none like Ramain all the three worlds. How can she be staying with Ravana? That isimpossible. This cannot be Sita.”he decided for sure!Now Hanuman searched very fast, in every nook and corner, but with nosuccess. Finallyhe ended up on a rampart wall, in total despair at hisfailure. “How can I go back? My mind has not been contaminated. Yet, Ihave not succeeded in my mission. If I go back and stand with my face bentdown in shame in front of Rama, he will give up his life at once. Lakshmanawill follow suit. The entirekingdomofAyodhyawill perish as a result.Sugreeva will not live. The vanara kingdom will perish. King Janaka will die.All the dynasties will be destroyed because of my failure. Only I willremain.Atleast if I do not return, they will live for a while in hopes ofreceiving good news. Hence I must remain here. Why should I remain here? Iwill give up my life. No. That is a great sin. I will wait under a tree withopen palms, and if any fruit falls intothem, I will eat. No. I will give up mylife by fasting, as an austerity. That is not considered a sin. The rishis do it.No.“Jeevan bhadraani pashyati.”Life should be lived. Eventually goodthings will happen. I must give up these thoughts of despair.Life is a giftfrom God. Only He has the right to take it.”The sadguru will protect. If nothing else can be done, then God’s nameshould be chanted. It is not good to blame oneself. One must remain strong.Suddenly Hanuman’s eyes fell on a secret garden. He exclaimed to himself,“This must be the Ashoka Vana, he realised. Vibheeshana had told me aboutit. I have not searched there.” Hanuman prayed to all the deities to granthim success in killing the rakshasa, and uniting Sita with Rama."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage36“Namostu Raamaaya sa Lakshmanaaya ...”He prayed to Rama,Lakshmana, Sita, and to all the celestials.The Sun was rising. Hanuman saw this auspicious sight. He saw his ownbody glow in the morning sun’s golden glow. He looked radiant. He waspleased. He remembered howhis mother Anjana would call him ‘BangaruKonda’, a mountain of gold! He mentally prostrated to her.Hanuman jumped from tree to tree and landed on a Shimshupa tree. Hecovered himself with leaves and hid amidst the branches of the tree. As helanded, the birds flew up into the sky making the early morning chirpingsounds. Hanuman looked around carefully. There was a river flowing nearby.He felt certain that Sita would come to the river early in the morning tooffer ablutions to the Sun God. He decidedto wait there.Suddenly, far away inside a mantapa (a hall with a canopy) he noticed awoman softly chanting the name of Rama. He had finally found MotherSita! He felt very happy. But he decided that this was not the right time toapproach her or talk to her. He had to be very careful in planning his nextmove. He decided to wait and think things through.Now Hanuman got a fresh doubt, a new worry. It was believed that onebecomes what one deeply contemplates upon. Since Sita was constantlychanting the name of Rama, it is possible that she would turn into Rama. Ifthat should happen, then how will he succeed in uniting Rama with Sita?Then he remembered that Rama is continuously thinking about Sita andrepeating her name, which means that Rama would then turn into Sita.Hanuman felt assured that regardless of what happens, there would still beRama and Sita for him to unite."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage37Do you know why Hanuman loves the betel leaf garland? It was these leavesthat covered and hid him while he was waiting to speakwith Sita. Theyprotected him in the Ashoka Vana. That is why.

Anjaneya,His devotion ,His RamaPrabhu, SitaMata, Her Pativratyam, the story itself is beautiful and nectarlike. This is infact the inner beauty which is brought to Ramayana byHanuma. Anjaneya Swami changed the scenario of Ramayana. Prior toSundara Kanda, there was only Karuna rasa in Ramayana.After Anjaneya’sentry, Karuna rasa(mercy) is transforms and Manifests as Anandarasa(Happy). Hence this chapter is called ‘Sundara kanda’. Infact Rama isthe one who gives Ananda. But Hanuma made Rama happy by searchingfor Sita, and handing her over to Rama. Sundara Kanda gives “PhalaSidhi”. Anjaneya swami plays the most important role in Ramayana.Anjaneya reached Simsupa Vriksha by dusk of the previous day and waitson the tree. He looked at Sita Mata. The previous night he mistookMandodari to be Sita Mata. But this time Anjaneya observes very carefullyand confirms that it is Sita Mata.[Whenever we have to a make adecision,first we have to remove unwanted thoughts from our mind ; onlythen we can make a good decisions.]Anjaneya has a soliloquy now.“How to go to Sita Mata?How to talk to her? I cannot go directly.If shelooks at me suddenly she may get scared of me??, he wondered.If I go toher in a hurry,I will lose the divine darshan of Sita Mata.Hence let me haveDarshan first."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage40I will go after sometime, he reflected!In this context, Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji brings out the topic of sensibledevotees who do not hurry to receive prasadam from Pujya Sri Swamiji,since once they take prasadam they will have to leave the place. They sitthere in their place, looking at Sri Swamiji and enjoying the pleasant anddivine Darshan.Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji also made a mention of HIS visittoDallas,Texas,USAduring April 2010. InDallasthere is abeautifulHanumanTemple. The devotees ofDallasrequested SriBalaSwamiji to render a Discouse in English on Sundarakanda in DallasAshrama. The children who are born and brought up in theUSAdo notunderstand the sentiments and subtleties! They wanted the gist andPhilosophy [Tattva]more than the story and the characters of Ramayana.Pujya Sri Bala Swamiji rendered His Discourse with the following points: ̈Rama is Paramatma. ̈Sita Mata is Prakrithi, the Nature.We have to protect our MotherEarth. ̈Ravana is Pollution which enters the Earth. ̈Pollution spoils nature; Ravana carried away Sita.[Pollution harmsprakrithi.] ̈Anjaneya,Maruti [Fresh Air] comes in and spreads to clear pollutionand establish pure air. This is Ramayana.In Rigveda, It is described this way;Atma is Rama, Sitais Swabhava,[Nature of a person]/Prakrithi[Nature]. Itis the Prakrithi which gives us paddy,we make rice out of paddy, and make"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage41money by selling rice. Nature/ Prakrithi is converted into Money,Vikrithi.Inlakshmi Ashtothara we recite,”Prakrithyai Namaha,VikruthyaiNamaha”.When there is a change, ordinary people become unnatural. In thisprocess,-Bhoota, Preta, Pishadis surround them and trouble them in theform of some inconvenience financially or by marring health. Hence Maruticomes to the rescue of such people too, by cleaning the surroundings and byestablishing a shield(Kavacha) around them.Maruti keeps praying that he should get an opportunity to speak to SitaMata. It is early in the morning when the Sun rays are about to touch thepremises ofLanka. Anjaneya suddenly looks at a towering personalityfollowed by many people, along with veda recitation, Music band andRecitation of mantras by priests and Musicians. The whole group is comingcloser to the place where Anjaneya is waiting on a tree.Ravana is lookingdifferent from what Anjaneya saw in the previous night when Ravana wasasleep. But now His red eyes symbolize all His bad habits.. He has one ladywith madhupatra, from which He drinks and there is another lady on theother side with a vessel in which Ravana spits.Ravana is looking very strong and powerful. Ravana’s clothes which aresupposed to be on His shoulder are slipping down and Ravana is not awareof it. That is the state of His mind.[Anjaneyais such that he would help to any extent to a person inupliftment ofhis/her prosperity if HE is pleased with one’s devotion. IfAnjaneya is not pleased with one’s devotion, the consequences will be theother way round. That is why we should always pray for Anjaneya’s goodDRISHTI onus.When Anjaneya looks at Sita Mata, She looks like the one who gives up“Swaadhyayana”[Though we complete our Academic degrees, and take up ajob we should never give up studying for ourselves.]"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage42Ravana came to Sita Mata and says this way:At the outset Ravana starts blaming and abusing Rama.“Don’t ever expect Rama to come and save you ! You marry me. This wholeLanka is yours if you marry me. Not only Lanka,what ever you wish for,will be at your feet! If you aspire, I will put all the three worlds at your feet!”This is how Ravana tries to lure Sita Mata.[We need to have power,strength and intellect while performing anydeed.Our life is given by God. It should be put to use in a proper way.]Karma Phala Thyagam:We cannot decide what we deserve and what we want. If we recollect thestory of the three seeds sown by the sage Vasistha, the three seeds wantedto grow and wanted to become something great; where as all thethreeended in three divine forms of Rama’s boat, Rama’s cradle andRama’s padukas.Ifwe put forth a wish/ask for a boon, that would be verysmall since our intellect is very minute compared to Guru’s grace. If youleave the decision to the Guru,the Phala will be amazing.Ravana is not equal to me in penance. Rama is not as strong as I’mWhatabout riches? Rama dwells in a forest .He is not an eminent and a radiantfigure.Listening all these words, Sita says ,“Yes whatever you said is correct. Rama is definitely not equal to you. ButRama is greater than you. Rama cantake heaven into His hands with onearrow. Rama can take all the oceans into His control. Where is thecomparison for you with Rama!”Anjaneya is waiting for Ravana’s reaction for Sita Mata’s words.Ravana says that He would defeat Rama by waging a war against Ramaand then he would marry Sita!"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"HanumathSapthahamPage43Having been wild with these words, Sita Mata holds a darbha, agrassindicating that Ravana is as weak as a sapling of a grass. Rama isAgni He will burn you who will be burnt like a grass. With a peaceful mindyou sit on “Darbhasana” [a mat made of grass] and ponder over. You areaware all the shastras. You are Dasakantha. You can recite all the fourVedas. You can recite all the six shastras at a time. You are very powerful.She spoke all these words aressing Ravana only by looking at the grass. SitaMata has many Vrata Deekshas and hence she does not look at Ravanawhile speaking. We fall short of words if we have to speak of Sita Mata.It isequal to speaking of the glory of Jayalakshmi Mata.That’s why Ramayana is also called “ Sita Charitra and “Poulastya Vadha”.Rama is born for Ravana’sSamhara.Sita then spoke,“You are talking so much about Rama!

Then Anjaneya praised Rama by saying that Rama was possessedwith the brilliance of the Sun, endurance of the Mother Earth, intelligenceof Bruhaspathy and glory of Indra.

Many demonleaders were killed in the war.Finally Indrajit, son of Ravana captured him and presented him in front ofRavana. There Anjaneya advised Ravana to release Sita. He praised Rama infront of Ravana. This made Ravana furious of Anjaneya and ordered to killhim. But Vibhishana, the virtuous brother of Ravana stoppedhim by sayingthat a messenger was not to be killed as it is a sin. Prahasta, the minister ofRavana had ordered to set fire to Hanuman’s tail.Hanuman started toincrease the size of his tail. All the clothes in Lanka were wrapped aroundhis tail which was not sufficient. All the cloths worn by the courtiersincluding Ravana were utilized to Wrap. Even then they fell short of clothand Ravana ordered to bring Sita’s clothes also. Then Anjaneya stoppedincreasing his tail and they were stopped from bringing Sita’s clothes. Histail was set to fire.Hanuman had then reduced the size of his body to that of a cat and hadjumped from one house to another starting with Prahasta’s house. All thehouses were set to fire except that of Vibhishana. All this was known to Sitaand she had prayed to the Fire God not to burn his tail. Anjaneya felt verycool in spite of his burning tail. He put the fire out by dipping his tail in thesea. Suddenly Anjaneya realized what he had done! The fire might havecaused danger to Sita also. He thought that he had behaved so foolishly infury.
