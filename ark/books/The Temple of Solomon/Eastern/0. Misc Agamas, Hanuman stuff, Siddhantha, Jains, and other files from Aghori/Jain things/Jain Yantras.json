"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Unique Jainism Art This version of the Navkar mantra is an original handmade illuminated manuscript painting (not a print) displaying a seated deity. The Navkar Mantra (spiritual chant) is the most important mantra in Jainism and can be recited at any time. The Navkär Mantra contains the main message of Jainism. The message is very clear. If we want to be liberated from this world then we have to take the first step of renunciation by becoming a monk or a nun. This is the beginning. If we stay on the right path then we will proceed to a higher state, Arihant, and ultimately proceed to Siddha after nirvana (liberation from the cycle of birth and death). The goal of every Jain is, or should be, to become a siddha. The painting is a colorful picture painted with oil on canvas. This art is rare. The painting measures 9 in. wide and 12 in. tall (23 cms X 30.5 cms).
