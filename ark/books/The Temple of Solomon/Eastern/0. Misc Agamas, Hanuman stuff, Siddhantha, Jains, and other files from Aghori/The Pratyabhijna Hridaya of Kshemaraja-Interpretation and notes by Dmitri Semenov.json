They touch upon a single facet of a complex andmultidimensional philosophical system calledPratyabhij ̃n ̄a, or thesystem of recognition of the pure form of Self. The current expo-sition is based on a particular elucidation of the system — that ofPratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayamby Kshemaraja.Pratyabhij ̃n ̄awas originally formulated in the context of a largersystem called Trika, which belongs to the tradition of KashmirShaivism. Therefore, it shares many concepts with other In-dian philosophies of liberation, in particular, with Patanjali Yoga,Vedanta, and Buddhism.Pratyabhij ̃n ̄awas developed in a text called ́Sivadr.s.t.i, com-posed by the sage Somananda; Utpaladeva elaborated on it in ̄I ́svarapratyabhij ̃n ̄ak ̄arik ̄a; it was simplified and condensed by Kshe-maraja inPratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayamand extensively commented uponby Abhinavagupta.On reading booksThere is no book that gives a recipe for enlightenment, and no sagehas the power to impart it, for the certainty of knowing shines onlywithin. On a spiritual path “direct experience alone has access tothe source of real knowledge.”1It is not possible to replicate the path of another, for one’s ownpath will be as unique as the iris of one’s eye.Notwithstanding this uniqueness, if one approaches the problemwith the resolve to discover and to experiment, then the vast bodyof scriptural knowledge and the spirit of living traditions will be ofgreatest help.1See “Direct Experience Alone is the Means” in [Ram99]."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"viiiScriptural sourcesHere is a list of books that I found to be helpful with understandingspecifics of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄a, in no particular order: ̄I ́svarapratyabhij ̃n ̄ak ̄arik ̄aof Utpaladeva with the Authors’s V.rtti,by Raffaele Torella, Motilal Banarsidass, 2002Pratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayam, The Secret of Self-Recognition,by Jaideva Singh, Motilal Banarsidass, 2003Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme,by Swami Lakshmanjoo, Kashmir Shaivism Fellowship, 2000Nothing Exists That is not Shiva,by Swami Muktananda, SYDA Foundation, 1997The Splendor of Recognition,by Swami Shantananda, SYDA Foundation, 2003Scriptural sourcesHere are scriptural sources used and abbreviations for them.TATantr ̄alokaby AbhinavaguptaAbhTsTantras ̄araby AbhinavaguptaIPK ̄I ́svarapratyabhij ̃n ̄ak ̄arik ̄aby UtpaladevaShS ́Sivas ̄utraShSv ́SivasvarodayaVBhVij ̃n ̄anabhairavaBhGBhagavadg ̄ıt ̄aYSYogas ̄utraby PatanjaliSvaTSvacchandatantraMrAMr.gendr ̄agamaTtPTattvaprak ̄a ́saHYPHat.hayogaprad ̄ıpikaby SvatmaramaShSVR ́Sivas ̄utrav ̄artikaManUpM ̄an.d.ukyopanis.ad"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsixShV ́S ̄aktavij ̃n ̄anaby SomanandaAN Anguttara Nikaya, Sutta PitakaSN Samyutta Nikaya, Sutta PitakaDN Digha NikayaDhP DhammapadaAcknowledgmentsI am very grateful to Alexey Tuzhilin, extensive discussions withwhom helped to shape this book, and who inspired me to continuewriting it.

My hope is thatthis book will lessen the frustration of translating the very obscurelanguage of traditional written sources into practical methods, atleast for people with background in hard sciences."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"IntroductionScopeIf one were to use two distinct categories of things, “the mental”and “the physical,” then “the mental” is the only subject of thisphilosophical investigation. Practically, it is helpful to imaginethe receptive fields of our sense organs: the retina, the cochlea,the skin, the taste buds of the tounge, the olfactory bulbs of thenose, etc., and to contemplate the fact that what is given to usas the perceived Universe is only a stream of stimulation on thesurface of those receptive fields. The rest — three dimensionalspace, time, colors, music, faces, objects, landscapes, etc. — isan interpretation of those streams of stimulation by our psychicsystems.Pratyabhij ̃n ̄aconcerns itself mostly with what happensduring such interpretation, not with the physical structure of theUniverse. Therefore, in what follows the term “Universe” means“the entire Universe as reflected in one’s own being.”ProblemA universal philosophical proposition is that “the senses deceivethe mind.”2The appearance of things given in sensations, andthe mental ideas, formed of them, are, unless one follows carefullydesigned method, indeterminate, variable, unstable, illusory andsubject to errors.3There are at least two ways to make the deception less pervasive.One is to arm the mind and the senses with tools that make per-ception and reasoning more robust, self-correcting, and universal.2As Diogenes Laertius put it, “The senses are deceivers, and reason disagreeswith itself.”3For extensive discussion, see Bertrand Russell,Problems of Philosophy:Appearance and Reality."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2The other one is to purify perception and reasoning from factorsthat facilitate the deception, like desires, emotions, and conceptsof “self.”Whereas Western philosophical traditions, pursuing the firstpath, design tools like logic, mathematics, Socratic method of hy-pothesis, etc., and scientific instruments that enhance our senses,Indian doctrines of liberation pursue the second path, aiming to re-move the emotional, ego-related, and psycho-physiological sourcesof the deception. If natural philosophy is to bring into the sphereof to-be-known as yet unknown aspects of the physical world, thenyoga is to make knowable the hidden inner realms.It should be noted that the ability to use logic or to follow theSocratic method of hypothesis or the Cartesian method of system-atic doubt presupposes at least a partial independence of processesof perception, cognition, and reasoning from the emotional planeof psyche, from all personal constructs, from ego, etc. Thoughthis independence occurs naturally, without any special training,it is sporadic and vulnerable to pressures of necessity and timeconstraints. The doctrines of liberation aim at attaining robust4independence in a systematic fashion. When this independence isuniversal, pervasive, and permanent, it is called “enlightenment.”“Enlightenment is a state of freedom from the ignorance thatcauses suffering. . . ”5[Ram82].MethodsAny systematic practice, derived from a doctrine of liberation, iscalledyoga.6A set of such practices, individualized and adjustedto circumstances, is calleds ̄adhana.Practices of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄asystem are of three types: ana-lytical, practices of concentration, and psycho-physiological. An-alytical practices consist of finding out the configuration of cer-tain psychological processes and reconfiguring them. Concentra-tion practices are those of focused concentration, meditation, andsam ̄adhi. Psycho-physiological practices are those that work with4Robustness is of essense, for if the subtlety of one’s state is ruined by amorsel of food or a smile from a nice girl, it is not much of an achievement.Methods relying on emaciation or starvation of the powers of the mind or of thebody, lead primarily to non-robust results. That is why Buddha abandonedsuch methods.5More technical definition will be given later, when necessary concepts aredefined.6The Bhagavad Gita gives a good idea of the variety ofyoga-s."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"3posture ( ̄asana), breath and flows of vital energies such aspr ̄an.a,ap ̄ana, etc. (see [Dev87] for extensive treatment of these pratices).Results of the practices are determined in part by the philoso-phical position one adopts. For example, if one practices ̄asana-s,while adopting materialistic position, then benefits would be lim-ited primarily to stretching, exercising muscles, and massage ofglands. If, on the other hand, one practices the same ̄asana-s butadopts the philosophy of hatha yoga, then, in addition to the bene-fits mentioned, one would develop dispassion toward one’s physicalbody and gain higher level of awareness.Another example is provided by the ethics of relations. If oneadopts the position that an ethical treatment of others is nothingmore than an internalized threat of punishment by authorities, thenfollowing ethical rules would create a growing sense of rebellion. If,on the contrary, one follows the same rules but adopts the principleof non-violence (ahim.s ̄a) towards sentient beings, then among theresults would be a sense of tranquility and sympathetic friendliness.One reason for this dependence of practice results on an adoptedphilosophical position is that many practices bring perception, cog-nition, emotions, and somatic processes into a state that is inde-terminate and unstable to a much higher degree than what occursnaturally. An adopted philosophical position, whether it is adoptedconsciously, subconsciously, or unconsciously, influences how thisindeterminacy will be resolved. Philosophical systems conduciveto the pursuit of enlightenment promote psychological plasticity,avoidance of opinions where they can be avoided, and moderationin all aspects of life.Another reason for the dependence of practice results on anadopted philosophical position is the fact that the ideas one hasabout the object of investigation (that is, one’s own mental phe-nomena) might change that very object.To address this dependence, there are two threads of exposition:one provides an analytical framework that affords relative stabilityof the object of the investigation; the other outlines procedures foran effective transformation of the same.Thus, for the approach, adopted here, a study of the conceptualsystem and of major postulates is of the essence.There are two major classes of procedural content for any sys-tem of liberation. One group is calledsattarka, ortrue reasoning.The other is calledbhakti, orwholesome devotion to a deity or toa guru.The procedural content of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄asystem belongs pri-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4marily to the methods ofsattarka. As said in theP ̄urva ́s ̄astra,reasoning is the highest component ofyoga.7The choice betweenthesattarkaand thebhaktipaths, or a choice of balance betweenthe two, is to be made in accordance with individual disposition.The path ofbhaktiwill not be touched upon in this book.An important component of asattarkapath is pragmatic em-piricism, as expounded in the Kalama Sutta (AN.3.65):Do not go upon what is heard frequently;nor upon a tradition;nor upon a rumor;nor upon a scripture;nor upon a conjecture;nor upon an inference;nor upon an analogy;nor upon compatibility with various views;nor upon another’s seeming ability;nor upon the consideration, “This contemplative is ourteacher.”. . . when you yourselves know: “Thesethings arefavorable;thesethings are not injurious;thesethingsare praised by the wise;thesethings, undertaken andobserved, lead to benefit and happiness,” adopt themand abide in them.One might take tradition, scriptures, teachings imparted by ateacher, etc., very seriously, but one should not take knowledgegained from these sources as a manifest truth, for such truth is ob-tained only through one’s own direct experience. Tradition, scrip-tures, teachers, the example set by an advanced practitioner, infer-ences, etc., might be excellent guides that lead away from errors,but one’s own experience is the only ever-present light.There is nothing supernatural about the process of attainingenlightenment or about the result; it is not necessary to have beliefin God [Ram82]. Everyone has an inborn potential for enlight-enment the same way everyone has the inborn ability for logicalreasoning. It just needs to be cultivated.An important thing to note is that practices, constructs, andconcepts, exposed in this book, are reflecting experiences of a man.Since woman’s brain, physiology, and body have a somewhat differ-7 ́sr ̄ıp ̄urva ́s ̄astre tatproktam.tarko yog ̄a ̇ngamuttamamTA.4.15.a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"5ent morphology and function, it is not clear that these techniqueswould work as well for women.AttitudesWhen I pushed forward,I was whirled about.When I stayed in place,I sank.Oghatarana SuttaOne does not pursue enlightenment out of fancy, for the pathis torturous, the goal uncertain,8and the will to advance treacher-ous.S ̄adhanais at times brutal, even when its fruits are blissful.Therefore, the first requisite condition for any serious practice is afirm resolve.Next, the real motive behind the initial pursuit of enlighten-ment, is rarely enlightenment itself. So, it is important to makeone’ss ̄adhanaattuned to that motive. Here is Buddha’s advice:9One should not neglect one’s own quest by adopting aquest of another, however great. Having come to fullunderstanding of one’s own quest, one has a chance topursue the quest for what is real.Attaining “what is real” is “the prime necessity of every humanlife”[Ram82].Another major factor of progress is the will to contemplate. Assaid in ́Sivas ̄utra,Realization of the Truth comes from the will to contem-plate.10He, who realized the Truth, lives in completefreedom.11Sometimes, when one knows exactly what to contemplate and howto do it, this “will to contemplate” is absent. The source of the “willto contemplate” is knowledge, obtained from direct experience.128What is sought is unknown in details untill it is found.9DhP.16610dh ̄ıva ́s ̄at sattvasiddhih.ShS.III.1211siddhah.svatantrabh ̄avah.ShS.III.1312This requires some explanation. There is a gap between watching livedemonstrations of practices or being able to verbally describe them, and theactual performance of practices that brings results. In the course of practice,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6Next, one should be following some reasonable criteria for cor-rectness and relevancy of practices. These criteria are specific tothe technique used and to one’s disposition, and change with time.Overall, if practices are effective then many reactions, includingsome belonging to the autonomic nervous system, become less auto-matic. Successful practices should result in less reactivity in generaland should lead to the Unknown, providing experiences of amaze-ment and wonder; practice results should be robust and lasting,even after the practice ends. A good criteria is formed by recol-lecting a state of mind as close as possible to the goal of a particularpractice, and using that recollected state as a mark, proximity towhich is the criterion. If practice is relevant to one’s current stage,then perceptible and intended changes should be apparent in threemonths at most.Another important attitude is the personal preciousness of free-dom. If absent, many practices will lack proper motivation. In thecourse of as ̄adhanathis preciousness will only increase.Do not expects ̄adhanato become a safe harbor or a refuge fromthe world. If one thinks ofs ̄adhanaas an escape from the “slingsand arrows of outrageous fortune,” then the friuts will likely bevery limited. The spiritual path helps one to cope with “outrageousfortune” without escaping it. One indicator of an effective practiceis being on the edge of the Unknown and facing problems that onewould prefer to avoid.one constantly faces uncertainty and confusion, especially while engaged inanalytical practices. When this happens, the philosophical system providesparadigms and principles that point out where and how further efforts shouldbe applied, but it does not supply the will to actually do it. It is one’s ownexperience that provides crucial particular details, instrumentation, and con-centration of willpower, that bridge that gap. Maintaining a journal makesone’s own experiences readily available."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"7What should be avoided:any activity or practice that makes one oblivious orless sensitive to cognitive and emotional dissonances,though it might lead to a blissful abiding;13joining any cult or being frequently exposed to a cult;14makings ̄adhanaa part of ego or a social role;taking any philosophical system as “the one and onlytrue system of liberation”;15secret doctrines or practices;16overreliance on empowerments, initiations and bless-ings, for these might convey, in addition to the benefitsthey confer, the message, “You are not self-sufficient.There is something that should be given to you.” InthePratyabhij ̃nasystem this message is considered tobe wrong.13Exposure to dissonances without means to cope with them is not generallybeneficial; rather, one should try to expand the spectrum of conflicts anddissonances that one is capable of coping with. There are many positive sidesto being sensitive to dissonances. One of them is the ability to follow theMiddle path. Another is an opportunity to eliminatevikalpa-s.14Cults are not necessarily religious. Among their common characteristicsare: exclusivity that leads to progressive social and/or intellectual isolation;supression of critical thinking, that is substituted by a group-think; sharp andrigid boundaries between members of the cult and outside society, that lead to“us” vs. “them” group dynamic; a set of “truths” that each member is obligedto believe are evident.15Such belief causes resistance to using techniques and concepts from othersystems that at times might be more relevant to one’s needs.16One sometimes reads in ancient scriptures that this or that practice is“secret.” What is often meant by “secret” is that even if one reads a descriptionof some practice or observes it, but does not possess the experiential layer ofmeaning required to understand and benefit from the practice, then the truemeaning of what was read or observed remain hidden, or “secret.” But it isnot a “secret,” that is maintained by a conspiracy of the initiated. As SwamiMuktananda wrote, “Your path should be one that is open to everyone.”The other meaning of the term “secret” in scriptures is that a practice is“hidden” by layers of preliminary practices, without mastering of which thepractice might be injurious."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":";\fa;.ca;\u000ba;taH.~va;ta:n:a;a;a;va:(õ;a;\u000ea;sa;\fa:;dÄâ;he ;tuaHÁ Á1Á Á.~vea;.cC+.ya;a.~va;\u000ea;Ba:a;Ea;a;va:(õ;a;mua;n}å.\u0004a;a;l+.ya;\u000ba;taÁ Á2Á Áta;a;a;na;aA;nua:\u001e+.pa;g{a;a;hùÅ:a;g{a;a;h;k+:Bea;d;a;t,aÁ Á3Á Á;\fa;.ca;\u000ba;ta;sMa;k+:ea;.ca;a;tma;a..cea;ta;na;ea Y;a;pa.sMa;ku+:\fa;.ca;ta;a;va:(õ;a;ma;yaHÁ Á4Á Á;\fa;.ca;\u000ba;ta;=e +va..cea;ta;na;pa;d;a;d;va:\u001e+.Q+a..cea;tya;sMa;k+:ea;\fa;.ca;n\u0004a;a;\fa;.ca:a;m,aÁ Á5Á Áta;n}å.a;ya;eama;a;ya;a;pra;ma;a;ta;aÁ Á6Á Á.sa..cEa;k+:ea;a;dõ:\u001e+.pa;\u0000///\u000fa;~:a;ma;ya;(ãÉa;tua:=+a;tma;a.sa;a;pa:úãÁ*.a;k+:~va;Ba;a;vaHÁ Á7Á Áta;;Âå ÅU+\u000ea;ma;k+:aH.sa;vRa;d;ZRa;na;\u0000//////\u000fa;~Ta;ta;yaHÁ Á8Á Á;\fa;.ca;dõ:a;.cC+.\u000ba;+:sMa;k+:ea;.ca;a;t,ama;l+.a;vxa;taH.sMa;sa;a:=\u0005 +aÁ Á9Á Áta;Ta;a;a;pata;dõ;tpa:úãÁ*.a;kx+:tya;a;\fa;nak+.=+ea;\u000ba;taÁ Á10Á ÁA;a;Ba;a;sa;na:=+\u000ba;+:a;va;ma;ZRa;na;b\u0004a;a:ja;a;va;~Ta;a;pa;na;a;va;l+.a;pa;na;ta;~ta;a;\fa;naÁ Á11Á Áta;d;pa;\u0006a:=;:]a;a;nea.~va;Za;\u000ba;+:\u000ea;Ba;v.ya;Ra;ma;ea;a;h;ta;ta;a.sMa;sa;a;\u0006a:=+tva;m,aÁ Á12Á Áta;tpa;\u0006a:=;:]a;a;nea;\fa;.ca:a;mea;vaA;nta;mRua;K\u0004a;a;Ba;a;vea;na..cea;ta;na;pa;d;a;Dya;a:=+ea;h;a;t,a;\fa;.ca;\u000ba;taHÁ Á13Á Á;\fa;.ca;\u000ba;ta;va;a;îå+.=;=+ea;h;pa;deC+.a;ea Y;a;pama;a:a;ya;amea;yea;nDa;nMa:pìÉÅ;u+Sya;\u000ba;taÁ Á14Á Ába;l+.l+.a;Bea;a;va:(õ;a;ma;a;tma;sa;a;tk+.=+ea;\u000ba;taÁ Á15Á Á;\fa;.ca;d;a;na;nd;l+.a;Bea:de ;h;a;a;d;Sua..cea;tya;ma;a;nea;Sva;a;pa;\fa;.ca;dE ;k+:a;t}ya;pra;\u000ba;ta;pa;\ra:a;d;a;Q.a .j\u0004a;a;va;n}å.ua;\u000ba; HÁ Á16Á Áma;Dya;a;va;k+:a;sa;a;\ra;a;d;a;na;nd;l+.a;BaHÁ Á17Á Á;a;va;k+:pa;[a;ya;Za;\u000ba;+:sMa;k+:ea;.ca;a;va;k+:a;sa;va;a;h;.cCe +.d;a;dùÅ;a;nta;k+:ea;\u000ba;f;\fa;na;Ba;a;l+.na;a;d;yaI+.h;ea;pa;a;ya;aHÁ Á18Á Á.sa;ma;a;\u000ba;Da;sMa;~k+:a:=+va;\u000ba;tav.yua;tTa;a;neaBUa;ya;ea;BUa;ya;\ra;(ãÉa;dE ;k+.a;a;ma;Za;Ra;\ra;a;tya;ea;a;d;ta.sa;ma;a;\u000ba;Da;l+.a;BaHÁ Á19Á Áta;d;a:pra;k+:a;Za;a;na;nd;sa;a:=+ma;h;a;ma:n:a;v\u0004a;a;ya;Ra;tma;k+:pUa;Na;Ra;h;nta;a;vea;Za;a;t,a.sa;d;a.sa;vRa;sa;gRa;sMa;h;a:=+k+:a;\u0006a:=+\fa;na:ja;sMa;a;va;e +va;ta;a;.ca;kÒe+.(õ;a:=+ta;a;pra;a;\u000ba;a:=,Ba;va;t\u0004a;a;\u000ba;ta;\ra;Za;va;m,aÁ Á20Á ÁSanskrit text of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayam."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Concepts. . . those who do not observethe movements of their ownminds must of necessitybe unhappy.Marcus AureliusThe formulation of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄asystem presented here isattributed to Kshemaraja. It is very short — 20 sentences — andfits onto one page (see the opposite page).Many concepts of the system, describing mind/cognition are ofa dynamic, of a movement. Herein is a difficulty of both describingand understanding these concepts. In order to become perceptible,that dynamic has to be projected onto some material substratum.For example, to explain the concept of “falling” one shows fallingobjects — an apple, a stone, a feather, etc. Understanding thisexplanation requires one to abstract the observed falling of an ap-ple, a stone, a feather, etc., from a particlar object falling, fromthe time it takes for it to fall, from the place it is falling into, fromthe cause of the fall, and so on. Only then might the abstractconcept of falling be understood. The same way, understandingof the highly abstract concepts of Kashmir Shaivism philosophicalsystems requires abstraction of the observable dynamics of mentalphenomena from the content or the substratum of that dynamic.In each case, such a process of systematic abstraction is left to thepractitioner.Below is a vocabulary of concepts required for understandingeverything that follows. It should be noted that the basic con-cepts of this philosophical system are undefined, for they are notreducible to other concepts (the same way the concepts of a point,a line and a plane are undefined in the Euclidean geometry).

At times, their meaning is quite different from system tosystem, which might contribute to confusion. Only meanings usedin thePratyabhij ̃n ̄asystem are pointed at in here.In Trika, many concepts are presented as a projection of thetriadj ̃n ̄ana,kriy ̄a,icch ̄a(approximately translated as “perception,activity, desire”).

Now, the same question, if answered onthe basis of a notion, will likely yield the response “Thetall one.” If the knowledge of preservation of the vol-ume of liquids were the basis of the response, the an-swer would be “Both have the same amount of water.”Though the employment of a notion instead of knowl-edge in this case is exhibited mostly by children, in morecomplex situations arising during introspection, it is acommon occurence.A notion is quite easily morphed by strong emotions,because judgments of perceptual similarity are. On theother hand, knowledge is only slightly affected by evenstrong emotions, because procedural measurements aresuch. The purest form of knowledge is mathematics.Even if one is tempted to find that the sum of the in-terior angles of a triangle is less than 180 degree, (suchtemptation might arise, for example, in case of socialcoersion — if everyone around gets this result), the pro-cedure of obtaining a mathematical proof would yieldthe correct result.The difference between notions and knowledge alsomanifests itself in dealing with contradictions. Whencontradiction arises, if notions are employed, then thecontradiction is resolved by either omission of a premiseor by stretching boundaries of some notions. On theother hand, if knowledge is employed, it forces one tosearch for false premises.Whenever a judgment is generated by a vague sense of“it seems OK,” or “it feels OK,” or by a sense of emo-tional or cognitive dissonance, it is likely to be the resultof a notion. In this case an appearance of certainty isderived from the strength of like/dislike attitudes.Whenever a judgment is generated by a procedure, itis likely to be the result of a knowledge, and its cer-tainty is derived from the degree of universality of thatprocedure.Thinking with notions is guided by avoidance of cogni-tive and emotional dissonance. Thinking with knowl-edge is directed by logic and procedures."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"27Generalizations, induction, verbal formulations, and ex-trapolations usually lead to notions. In order to ele-vate a notion to the level of knowledge, it must be aug-mented with a procedure having definite conditions ofapplicability. This means that all definitions given herewill, under the best circumstances, give rise to notions;these notions might be transformed into knowledge bypractical application aimed at making them procedural.Such transformation of notions into knowledge shouldbe a part of anys ̄adhana.Unfortunately, the field of introspection does not affordmeasurement procedures or a factual knowledge baseof any substantial size, since memories are subject tofiltration, re-casting, and a variety of interpretations.Here are some operations that approach the status of ameasurement procedure:noticing that something was/is present in the per-ceptual field;noticing states of agitation, calm, desire, impul-siveness, etc.;noticing a contradiction;noticing that a particular idea/thing is in the fieldof attention;directing attention towards something in particu-lar;concentrating the attention on something in par-ticular;inhibiting or suppressing of activation of some im-age/idea;following an instruction;applying a rule of logic.The closest to procedural knowledge in this field areprinciples, paradigms, and scripts. A principle is not amathematical law. It is an expression built with con-cepts as close to knowledge as possible, and it states atruth not easily derivable from observations, for obser-vations are always incomplete and subject to diverginginterpretations.An example of a principle is the maxim from TA.15.236.bahant ̄ay ̄am.hi dehatvam., which states that “corporeal-ity comes from consciousnessI am suchorI intend to be"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28Conceptssuch,” and reflects, among other things, deep connec-tion between volitional concept of self and physiologicalprocesses.55A paradigm is a schema which defines a set of patternsto which phenomena would conform if properly ana-lyzed.

In the process of perception and cognitionthat produces this sense of difference or manifoldness, there are atleast two components:gr ̄ahyaandgr ̄ahaka. The sense of differ-ence is produced by partial incompatibility between the two. Thegreater the variety ofgr ̄ahaka-s, the greater the manifoldness ofexperiences.102The deepest reason for these incompatibilities isvimar ́sa. To put it in plain language, there is an inherent tendencyto perceive the same object as a little bit different from itself eachtime it becomes an object of perception.A reasonable objection to the postulate “the manifoldness is aresult of divergences betweengr ̄ahakaand correponding to it (orconformable to it)gr ̄ahya” is that some of the differentiation be-tween stimuli is already hard-wired into organs of perception. Wecan tell a sound from a flash of light without any learning or pro-jecting of some inner patterns. This objection is addressed by thefollowing observation. There was an experiment made in whichsubjects were wearing up-down inverting spectacles. Initially, theywere seeing everything upside-down. But with the passing of timean inversion occured, the normal perception returned despite wear-ing the glasses. When the subjects stopped wearing the glassses,they experienced another inversion and, thus, a restoration of nor-mal vision. Thus, some mental structures, not the organs of percep-tion, adapt the differentiation of “up-down” to become consistentwith other activities. So, the view ofPratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayamsystemis that all sources of stimulation are like space directions in a vac-uum — there is a multitutde of them, but they are all the same.102This might be observed when one takes lessons in drawing and starts notic-ing a lot of new details, imperfections, etc., in familiar pictures."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58ManifoldnessThe differentiation is introduced during the interpretation called“perception.” Some of the differentiating patterns might be givenprenatally, for it is establsihed that newborns are capable of percep-tion and making distinctions.

A reflection in a mirror, with whichcitiwascompared ins ̄utra2, cannot form stable entities nor can it becomelimited, without some other substance.An autonomous instance of the contraction ofcitiis a processthat restricts in real time the facilitation provided bycitito aportion of the perceptual space, and/or to a portion of the space ofactions, and/or to a portion of the space of desires/emotions. Thisautonomous instance is, in essence, nothing but a part ofcitithatacts as an inhibitor103towards the whole ofciti.The first condition of self-limitation is given as “contraction,”or abbreviation. This means that the energy of ́saktishould becomerelatively low in order to become trapped in a stable configuration.The second condition is an isolation from other regions thatmakes a low energy configuration autonomous.Once an autonomous instance of contraction ofcitiappears,the process of restriction of the facilitation (that isciti) becomes,with time, more automatic and robust.104By becoming well sepa-rated from other regions, it can withstand higher and higher levelsof ́sakti, without starting to dissolve. Some of the autonomousinstances are pre-existing at birth.The autonomy and, thus, the multitude of active centers, areonly apparent, since the source of the autonomy is in the nature of103How cancitiinhibit herself? It happens similarly to the way gravity actsagainst itself with the help of a weight scale, where a larger weight counteractsthe gravitational force acting upon a smaller weight, so as to move it upwards.Another analogy is a sound wave reflected by another sound wave that has avery high intensity.104Complex and multi-step psychological processes tend with time to assume acontracted and one-step form. For example, typing “the” is initially a sequenceof separate actions: pressing letter “t,” changing finger position for the letter“h,” pressing “h” changing finger position for the letter “e,” pressing “e.” Withpractice, this process becomes contracted and forms a single gesture — typingthe word “the.”"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"60Manifoldnessciti, andcitiis the one and the only active agent behind all mentalactivity. Sheisself-impelling.Despite being limited, any such autonomous intance is capableof reflecting the whole. Thus, a limited individual, that resultsfrom multiple contractions, is still capable of the right conceptionthat leads to the removal of all limitations.Given the two conditions for the formation of autonomous in-stances, it is possible to devise ayoga, based on raising the level of ́saktiand on establishing deep analogies and correspondences be-tween relatively isolated areas of experience. Suchyoga-s exist intantric traditions, where macrocosm–microcosm correspondences,images, integrating multiple modalities, and the use of all functionsof the body to raise the level of ́saktiare all well articulated. Prac-tices ofPratyabhij ̃n ̄ahr.dayamsystem use precise concentration of ́saktion the barriers to dissolution. The instrument for such con-centration is knowledge, gained on the path oftrue reasoning.Each autonomous instance of contraction ofcitiundergoescyclic transformations. Each cycle is a cycle of emission–persistence–contraction105that is only a restricted version of the same cyclewith whichcitimanifests itself in creating the Universe.In the sphere of emotions, an autonomous instance of contrac-tion ofcitiemanates from the restricted at some point faculty tomake everything a subject of cognition/contemplation/decision. Inparticular, when the ability to doubt everything is restricted, itcauses the emergence of a particular autonomous instance of con-traction ofciti— Ego. The more restrictive the instance, the moreit becomes Ego and is perceived as “I.” As a consequence, thestronger the Ego, the more it resists a removal of the restrictionsthat give it its existence for the Ego is a self-imposed limitationthat forbids questioning its own foundations.The instances of contraction ofcitiexist in a variety of scales,from a single recollection (that is less vivid and detailed than theoriginal impression) to major modes of consciousness, like sleep,meditative trance, hypnotic trance, etc.Next, some major modes of consciousness will be discussed.Ordinary consciousness has a variety of distinct instances thesame way an actor plays a variety of roles.

The short exposition belowfollows Swami Rama’s book [Ram82], which is a commentary toM ̄an.d.ukyaupanishad.The first mode of consciousness is the waking state,vai ́sv ̄anara.It tunes into the gross, external [stimuli].106The content of con-sciousness is filtered by the Ego and is characterized by subject–object polarization.The second mode of consciousness is the dreaming state,tai-jasa. It tunes into the internal plane (fantasies, dreams, projec-tions of desires) and partakes of isolation (from the gross and theexternal).107The subject–object duality is still present, but it issomewhat less rigid than in the waking state.The third mode of consciousness is the abiding in deep sleep.When one is insensible [to external stimuli], desiring nothing anddreaming nothing, that state is the deep sleep.108This third mode, calledpr ̄aj ̃na, has no subject–object duality.It is an ocean of pure cognitions, saturated with bliss and experi-encing it. It has only one aspect — attentiveness.109In this mode,the unconscious is in the scope of awareness, and the fog of per-ceptual experiences and memories is not present to interfere withknowing it.These three modes might be called perceptual, imaginative, andconceptual states, correspondingly.Breaking barriers between these states is important for revers-ing these contractions ofcitiand, thus, for dissolving their isola-tion and autonomy. In order to break these barriers one shouldtranscend into another mode, or state of consciousness, calledthefourth(tur ̄ıya), which is the stateciticontracted from into thethree states.The fourthis characterized as follows:It is preeminent among all other states;it experiences and knows every other state;106j ̄agaritasth ̄ano bahih.praj ̃nah.sapt ̄a ̇nga ekonavim. ́satimukhah.sth ̄ulabhugvai ́sv ̄anarah.prathamah.p ̄adah.ManUp.3107svapnasth ̄ano′ntapraj ̃nah.sapt ̄a ̇nga ekavim. ́satimukhah.praviviktabhuktaijaso dvit ̄ıyah.p ̄adah.ManUp.4108yatra supto na ka ̃ncana k ̄amam.k ̄amayatena ka ̃ncana svapnam.pa ́syati tatsus.uptamManUp.5.a109sus.uptasth ̄ana ek ̄ıbh ̄utah.praj ̃n ̄anaghana ev ̄anandamayohy ̄anandabhuk cetomukhah.pr ̄aj ̃nastr.t ̄ıyah.p ̄adah.ManUp.5.b"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62Manifoldnessit regulates the inner feelings;it is the source of every other state;in it is the origination and dissolution of all mental phenomena.110One thinks of it asneither tuning into the internal plane,nor tuning into the external plane,nor tuning into both planes at once;as neither pure awareness,nor attention,nor non-attention;as unobserved, not experienced during the ordinary course of life(unlike the three other states),ungraspable by intuition,having no prior signs (or symptoms).111It is unimaginable, undefinable by means of verbal expression;it consists primarily of self-supportingbuddhi;it is soothing the proliferation of illusions caused by the employ-ment of language;it is free from passions, happy, having no dualities.

Inhibition canbe of two kinds: direct inhibition and distraction. If inhibition is tobe active in all experiences, even in the new and novel, both mech-anisms are needed, for memories might be inhibited directly, butnew pathways of recollection or new impressions require temporarydistraction to allow direct inhibition to set in.Secondly, there should be a motive or an impulse for an inhibi-tion.There are at least three sources of such motives or impulses.One is proximity or association with some mental “things,” theinhibition of which was decided upon during, or triggered by someevent in the past.The other one is the conscious decision to forget or avoid somememories or ideas that are too painful, or are deemed plainly neg-ative or unworthy.The third one is a built-in mechanism that is triggered by con-ditions that might lead to or are already causing, a psychologicaltrauma. When muscles are stretched beyond what they are habit-uated to, the neuromusclar apparatus sends them a signal to relax;it does this autonomously, without a conscious command. Thesame way, when a stimulus is too strong, or internal dissonancetoo violent, or when flows ofpr ̄an.a,ap ̄ana, etc. cause changes inmental processes that are too rapid or too unbalanced , an autono-muous inhibition, designed to protectantakaran.a, is activated. Inthe case of a too strong stimulus, the reaction might be numbnessor loss of sensitivity in some perceptual modality. In the case of aviolent cognitive dissonance, it might be suppression of parts of thesituation that cause the conflict. In the case of a violent emotionaldissonance, the reaction might range from depression, to tears, torage, to physiological stress, to fainting. In the case of too strongor disruptive flows113ofpr ̄an.a,ap ̄ana, etc., the defensive mecha-113For example, unimpeded flows throughsv ̄adhis.t.h ̄ana-cakramight bringunder certain circumstances an image of “social, and thus verbose, self” in thelikeness of the goddess Kali."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Postulates65nism consists of activating volitional impulses that block the flows.These defensive mechanisms should not be disabled or interferedwith, unless one has conscious command and control of specificmethods of dealing with potentially traumatic experiences.For additional notes on impulses for inhibition and how to dealwith them, see Appendix B.In order to understand sources of the motives or impulses toinhibit, one needs to contemplate what is a psychological crisis andwhat are the ways to resolve it. Here is a short schema.A psychological crisis is created when a situation (S) imposestoo strong of a limitation (L), as measured by the degree of “I-am-to-be-such” intent (D) and the time (T), meted out for realizingD.T might be defined not only by objective characteristics of S,but by am ̄atr.andka ̃ncuka-s as well.There are at least four ways to deal with such a crisis:1.a flightto perform actions leading to the avoidance of S alltogether2.a fightto perform actions that increase opportunities, waysand means to realize D in S3.a reduction of Dso that the same L does not cause a crisis4.an increase in Tif S allows itThe first way results in a major motive for long-term inhibition.It might be triggered on the instinctive level, especially by certainsmells, or it might be decided upon as, subjectively, the best courseof action. A consistent way to counteract existing long-term inhi-bitions, resulting from the flight reaction, is given by a verse114ofYoga Sutra:[Sam ̄adhiresults] from the predisposition to direct mindinwards upon that which is on the verge of dominating,or overwhelming.115The second way is feasible only if there is enough skill, means,and knowledge to make a fight, and if there is support fromhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. One of the after-effects of114 ̄ı ́svarapran.idh ̄an ̄adv ̄aYS.1.23115This interpretation of YS.1.23 appears quite different from traditional in-terpretations. There is no real contradiction here, just a difference of projec-tions onto different planes of practical meaning."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66Manifoldnessthe fighting response (itskarma) is an increase of personal values,associated with D, making ego stronger116and, thus, increasing thepotential for a future crisis. Another after-effect is the inhibitionof those constructs that were an expression of weakness during thefight. If the two after-effects of fighting are addressed afterwards,then fighting becomes a skillful way to deal with a crisis.The third way requires skills of emotional self-regulation. Thefourth way is done by psycho-physiological means117or by directlyadjusting current expectations — whatever gives more space tountie the knot of the crisis.The third and the fourth ways aim at a reconfiguration of thecrisis situation, instead of inhibition or repression, which alwaysresult in a long-term loss of awareness. The knowledge and skillsrequired for the third and the fourth ways of dealing with a crisis,are a part of thePratyabhij ̃n ̄asystem, but it is not the only systemto do this — most Indian philosophies of liberation teach skillsneeded for the third and the fourth ways.On a practical level, whenever one detects an inhibition of someideas, memories, actions, etc., one should analyze what type ofinhibition it is, what were the motives or impulses for it, and whatare the sources of these motives or impulses. Once the sources areknown, they might be weakened, reconfigured, or dissolved. Themotives and inhibitions devoid of the sources are relatively easy toremove.The existence of autonomic mechanisms for inhibition, that kickin when psychological tension becomes too high, means that oneshould move forward withs ̄adhanaone step at a time, avoidingshock experiences and too much continuous stress. For the samereason one should avoid changing lifestyle too abruptly.Let’s return to the origin ofm ̄ay ̄a.An original source of inhibition is an experience that causes apsychological crisis. Any such crisis is characterized by a momentof high level energy, or ́sakti. When the level falls, the schematicrepresentation of the crisis (S–L–D–T), augmented with structuresthat resolve it, forms acitta(sees ̄utra5). If resolution was accom-plished by means of inhibition, whether direct or through distrac-116Osho once noticed (inThe Book of Secrets), “It is difficult to find a yogiwho is not an egoist.

With time, it becomes augmented withmore and more detecting structures that evaluate a potential fora crisis, and with more and more deflecting structures (also calleddefense mechanisms). Because of this generalization, the complexbecomes apram ̄atr., which is a stable and robust source ofm ̄ay ̄a.There are three major mechanisms118to counteract the effectsofcittaand, in particular, to remove a support from apram ̄atr..The first is called ̄an.avah.visargah., or repose, or abatement ofcitta(attainable by deep relaxation and/or distraction). The second iscalled ́s ̄aktah.visargah., or full understanding ofcittastructure. Thethird is called ́s ̄am.bhavah.visargah., or dissolution ofcitta. Eachmechanism gives a name for a group of techniques, based primarilyon that mechanism.An important specific mechanism that gives rise to them ̄ay ̄ainvolves illusions staged by the Ego.A focused expression of free will along a very limited and direc-tional kernel (as expressed, for example, by the sentiment “this isexactly what I want,” followed by the resolve to obtain it) has aneffect of detachment from many other points of expression, it wasattached to. This detachment results in a temporary increase inthe mobility of free will, which in turn results in an expression of ̄ananda ́saktiand, thus, in an experience ofcamatk ̄ara. Therefore,if one is ignorant of this mechanism, or not observant of it, the Egopresents itself as the gate to the garden of bliss. But the Ego iscapable of opening it only in the presence of a strong opposition,so that a strong movement of attaching to one ideal causes pro-nounced detachment from others. The new attachment, if activelypursued after the dissipation ofcamatk ̄ara, becomes a driver of be-haviour. It becomes binding and therefore causes unease, turninginto suffering. In order to open that gate another strong oppositionto repeat pronounced detachment, is required. The Ego, therefore,is always on a quest to find strong dualities. Mistaking this recur-ring illusion, staged by the Ego, for the ultimate and natural stateof Self is the primordial ignorance (avijj ̄a(P)), which is the root ofall suffering (see commentary tos ̄utra8).118sa ca es.a visargastridh ̄a ̄an.avah.cittavi ́sr ̄antir ̄upah. ́s ̄aktah.cittasam.bodhalaks.an.ah. ́s ̄am.bhavah.cittapralayar ̄upah.AbhTs 3.25"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68Manifoldness.sa..cEa;k+:ea;a;dõ:\u001e+.pa;\u0000///\u000fa;~:a;ma;ya;(ãÉa;tua:=+a;tma;a.sa;a;pa:úãÁ*.a;k+:~va;Ba;a;vaHÁ Á7Á Ása caiko dvir ̄upastrimaya ́scatur ̄atm ̄a saptapa ̃ncakasvabh ̄avah.||7||Thatpram ̄atr., [though it is] self-same [for, in substance, it is noth-ing butcit], has two forms [as an illumination and as a veil], andthree expressions (as ̄an.avamala,m ̄ay ̄ıyamala k ̄armamala).

The schema of dependent co-arising makes it easier todetect patterns of manifestation, while the conceptual system ofthePratyabhij ̃n ̄aprovides an analysis that enables transformationsof the patterns.Some natural questions arise at this point: why are there mul-tiple systems of philosophy, all having the same goal? Why arethere multiple paradigms and principles? Are different formula-tions equivalent, or at least compatible?The purpose of a conceptual system is to provide a consistentand effectiveinstrumentationfor formation, detection, and con-trolled activation of mental formations, leading to the goal (en-ligtenment).To be useful for treading a path, a conceptual system shouldbring under investigation and make subject to transformation thosemental formations that were not analyzable or transformable inone’s practice without it. Which instrumentation is effective andfeasible, depends greatly on one’skarma,prakr.ti, education, pro-fession, teachers, community of peers, etc. A variety of these con-ditions is the cause of the variety of paradigms and philosophicalsystems of liberation.Any system of philosophy should be represented as a set ofparadigms, schemas, principles and practices comprising it, evenif such representation is incomplete. Then, paradigms, schemas,and principles should be reconstructed on the internal plane asknowledge (seebuddhi) in order to become an instrumentation. Itis the effectiveness ofinstrumentation— not the expressiveness(that is, not the ability to formulate any phenomena in terms ofthe system), not an analytic precision, not being part of a respectedtradition — that has a direct pragmatic value for as ̄adhana.Scripts and practices are not overly dependent on a philosoph-ical system and many are shared between various traditions. Thefruits of practices and the interpretation of failures to acquire thefruits are, however, quite dependent on the philosophical systemone uses as a guide. As long as there are no major contradictionswith one’s primary philosophical system, anything that works fora particular problem, might be used. Above all, Indian doctrinesof liberation are geared towards procedural effeciveness.Errors and failures due to inadequate understanding of con-cepts or due to erroneous concepts are the most difficult to detectand correct.

Mem-ories, wishes, skills, tasks, curiosity, etc., related to reading arestirred up in you. This is asr.s.t.i.

That is ananugraha.Sinceanugrahameans also “grace,” there is a danger of extro-version. As Swami Rama wrote in [Ram82],In religions, grace is considered to be a gift bestowedon the seeker, either as a reward for following the com-mandments or by mere whim. Thus, the bestowing ofblessings serves as a bribe to make one conform, and itimplies that the seeker is helpless to succeed by his owneffort. . . .

They affect reasoning, perception, emotions, passions,self-respect, sense of well-being, etc. They affect mood, breathing,relaxation, sleep, etc. They affect expression of hormones, activityof glands, pain in the spine, tooth decay, digestion, blood pressure,etc.The following is a short schema that I have found useful foranalyzing these reflections.There are two basic concepts: the mirror and the territory.Amirroris a representation of another person’s emotions,ideas, expressions of will, etc. It might be thought of as an integralinternalized representation that can be attributed with perception,desires and activity of its own.Due to such mirrors, one is able to become conscious of thefeelings, thoughts, and intentions of another without any guessingor interpretation, or to engage in an inner dialog with an absentperson; or to imagine how another would feel if one undertookcertain actions, etc.In general, a mirror can be a mirror of a sentient being, notnecessarily of a human.Inhibition of particular mirrors might be a consequence of emo-tional conflicts, facilitated by those mirrors. Such inhibition shouldbe detected and skillfully avoided by practices such as the Buddhistpractice of metta (compassion) andahim.s ̄a(the principle of non-violence to all sentient beings, including one’s self).Robust connections of mirror images with inner planes of knowl-edge, emotions, and volitions are protected byka ̃ncukas-s. Forexample, reflections into the plane of knowledge are effectively cre-ated by verbal formulas and are protected by automatic triggering138A “program” here is not something hardwired and not subject to change— it is merely a bias that might be unlearned."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90Social networks and hierarchiesof deductions; by the assumption of validity of particular opinions,given a positive prior experience; by abstraction from context ofvalidity of knowledge, and by the assumption that a knowledgedeemed valid necessitates action that accords with it.Aterritoryis a node in a social network. It might be a realterritory; it might be a voice in making certain decisions, it mightbe an amount of admiration from others, etc. In general, it is someresource, acquisition, or preservation of which depends on actionsor attitudes of other people or sentient beings. A resource might bematerial, like food, shelter, safety, sex, etc., or it might be virtual,like being an object of admiration or attention, being an authority,etc., or it might be a future potential for the material or virtualresources. The idea of a territory seems to be either built-in orlearned at a very early age on a non-conceptual level.The expansion of a territory, attributed to self, evokes positiveemotions, like elation, buoyancy, being accepted, etc., while eitherabsolute or relative contraction of one’s own territory causes var-ious negative emotions, like envy, fear, anxiety, dejection, etc. Ifa perceived territory is different from how it is reflected in otherpeople’s mirrors, it causes internal conflicts, anger, neurosis, etc.Social hierarchy is a relatively stable way to manage changesto territories without direct confrontation between members of thehierarchy.When territories are represented in the mind, they are of twodistinct flavors: those projecting outside and those projecting in-side. A representation of a territory, projecting inside, transfersthe energy of intentions, actions and emotions (reflected in mirrorscorresponding to some members of a social network) onto one’sown perceptions, actions, and emotions.139The active agent in aterritory projecting inside is referred to as “they,” “ he,” “she.”A representation of a territory, projecting outside, is a constructthat one’s expresses own intentions, desires, demands, and actionsthat ought to be reflected, directly or indirectly, by other membersof a social network. The active agent in a territory projectingoutside is referred to as “I.”A degree of the direct140influence on behaviour of various terri-tories is determined by the degree of one’s own resolve to hold ontothose territories and/or by one’s own predispositions of a physio-logical and psycho-physiological nature. Therefore, the first step139For example, when everybody around starts running in some direction, animpulse to start running in the same direction is quite pronounced.140that is, bypassing conscious consideration"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Appendix A91towards dissolution of the territories is to retract the resolve tohold onto them. The second is to bring physiological and psycho-physiological conditions to a roughly neutral position by leading abalanced lifestyle, like that of the Middle Way.An important example of a territory, projecting inside, is in-tentions and disposition of a dominant male/female or of a groupleader (accepted on a personal level as such). A penetrating shockof displeasure from a dominant male/female is one of the strongestand rarely brought fully to consciousness traumatic experiencesof the early years of life. An important example of a territory,projecting outside, is a social position of a group leader, or of anauthority.An excessive emphasis on expanding territories, projecting out-side, is a power trip towards the dominant position. An excessiveemphasis on expanding territories, projecting inside, is a humilitytrip towards self-abjection. The path of tantra is to make bothprojections irrelevant to one’s self in order to transcend them. Thetranscendence leads to dissolution of a big part of that very “self.”In order to attain liberation, all mirrors should be clear141andthere should be no territories that are stable beyond conscious effortto maintain them.When a territory, projecting outside, overlaps with a territory,projecting inside, it creates a strong internal conflict, having pro-nounced psycho-physiological effects (like headache, insomnia, rest-lessness, etc.). There are two major pathways to react to the con-flict: one is to tolerate it and thus “let it unfold,” the other is toshift the boundaries142of the territories. Behind the choice to shiftthe boundaries is an urge for definiteness in internal representationsof social networks — and it should be resisted. A distinct featureof this pathway is that an adjustment of internal representationsof one’s own territories happens prior to significant changes in theexternal circumstances of the conflict, and then an effort is appliedto make external circumstances conform to the adopted internalrepresentation. One should strive to form a tolerance to this typeof internal conflicts sufficient for the analysis and restructuring ofattachments and aversions related to them. To develop this tol-erance, one has to observe the avoidance of such internal conflictsand make an effort to keep attention on a conflict, while subjectingit to analysis and deconstruction. It is the resolution of an internal141non-inhibited142The shift of boundaries is reflected as a combination of submissive andaggressive postures."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"92Social networks and hierarchiesconflict, prior to attaining a rational view of it, that is the mostlasting negative effect of the conflict.Each territory might be protected from changes by the five ar-mors (see the entry forka ̃ncuka).For a territory, projecting outside,kal ̄a-tattvais expressed as speech, especially first person, emotion-ally charged utterances; as face expressions; as assertive body pos-tures;vidy ̄a-tattvais expressed as wishful thinking (as opposed to seeingthings as they are); as pursuit of skills, seen as allowing to controlother people; as valuing knowledge only if it is seen as furtheringexpansion or stability of one’s own territories; as the belief thathaving influence in social networks is necessary for survival;r ̄aga-tattvais expressed as a bias to see contentment/misery comingprimarily from social interactions; as taking interest primarily insocial interactions; as an urge “to change the world,” or as a desire“to make a difference”;k ̄ala-tattvais expressed as setting the duration, the pace, and theintensity of one’s own efforts to maintain/expand a territory;niyati-tattvais expressed as a belief that influence of “self” on “theexternal world” should be maintained/expanded; as an idea thatprojection outside is necessary to counter-balance projections in-side; as a sense that life has fixed purpose or meaning;143as a beliefthat loss of all outside projecting territories is death.For a territory, projecting inside,kal ̄a-tattvais expressed as a bias towards interpreting any speech asexpressing opinions about self; as serving others; as the feeling ofguilt; as a reactive behaviour; as transfer of expectations, and of thesearch for direction outside when inner resources seem exhausted;vidy ̄a-tattvais expressed as the belief that the social environment isthe primary source of knowledge; as having the desire for furtherdifferentiation of, and for establishing order in, a social hierarchy asthe primary motive for knowledge acquisition; as deriving ideas ofone’s own influence on others from influences of others upon one’sself; as having opinions of others as the basis of self-knowledge;144143“Man’s nature, his spirit, has no set purpose...” – Heraclitus144Since others tend to present their opinions as important, this becomes aself-sustaining illusion."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Appendix A93r ̄aga-tattvais expressed as taking praise and scorn as very relevantand personally important; as connecting praise with having theworld more interesting, varied, and colorful; as an inclination totake the advice of fear in the apparent absence of other alterna-tives;145k ̄ala-tattvais expressed as a modulation of the degree of expressionof others’ mirrors (for example, blanking out sharp words said bysomeone close); as set time limits for having certain mirrors active(for example, as deciding to attribute priority to parents’ opinionsuntil the age of 13);niyati-tattvais expressed as casting events in terms that create theillusion of no personal choice involved in the unfolding of events;as seeing an inclusion into social networks as a necessity; as takingopinions, wishes, and intentions of others as imperatives; as actingto fulfill a prophecy.The above list ofka ̃ncukaexpressions is by no means exhaustive.The real task is to find particular armors of particular territoriesand then to dissolve them.Any relaxation of the strength of both types of projectionsshould be done in synch to avoid strong disbalances, for ordinarilyboth types are finely balanced. Thus, several territories should bemade fluid in parallel. For example, removal of modulation of stim-ulation, reflecting intentions and emotions of others, needs simulta-neous dissolution of the transfer of the energy of those intentions oremotions into an imperative, by means of an inside-projecting ter-ritory. Such dissolution, in turn, requires a dissolution of outside-projecting territories, used to assert the concept of “I” as a counterbalance to projections inside; etc. Successful deconstruction of ter-ritories requires opening of energy flows throughchakra-s, whichin turn requires making some territories “fluid.”The key to dissolution of territories is to trace their forma-tion and stability to expressions of one’s own will and to psycho-physiological mechanisms that protect the psyche from damage.Then, all armors can be dissolved by retraction of resolve-formingexpressions of free will. Since dissolution of territories is usuallyaccompanied by quite negative emotions, at such times one has toregulate flows ofpr ̄an.aandap ̄anato be unobstructed, but ignorethe negative reaction in other respects.145Fear gains strong influence over behaviour only when one decides thatfollowing fear’s advice is good. If this decision is augmented byr ̄aga-tattva,then an addiction to fear is developed."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"94Social networks and hierarchiesSpeech is an instrument of defining “self” in terms of social in-teractions. The impluse to speak, or to utter words, is, in largepart, provided by motives related to positioning in social hierar-chies and networks. One consequence of this connection of speechto social networks is that the analysis of inner experiences, memo-ries, intentions, etc. should be on the non-verbal level of raw iconicrepresentation of feelings, memories, and inner gestures, since anyexpression in language conforms them to views and concepts de-fined by a social network, the purpose of which is to make thenetwork function smoothly, not to promote liberation.“I,” when uttered or implied by me, is projecting “self” intothe space of mirrors to maintain the persistence of “self.” Thisis an effect ofkal ̄a-tattva. “You,” when uttered, or implied, bysomeone else in reference to me, projects into “inside” territory asan imperative. The sense that it is the best escape from frustrationmakes a reflected opinion or wish or command such an imperative.This is an effect ofvidy ̄a-tattva. Both projections are beneficialunder certain conditions, especially those of learning and growingup.The power that social networks exercise over psyche is so greatthat various traditions sought to use it for attaining liberation. Asocial group that creates an environment for transcending socialhierarchies, including the group itself, is quite conducive to thepursuit of enlightenment. Upaddha Sutta, SN 45.2, makes exactlythis point:146As he was seated to one side, Venerable Anandasaid to the Blessed One,147“This is half of the holy life,lord: having admirable people as friends, companionsand colleagues.”“Don’t say that, Ananda. Don’t say that. Havingadmirable people as friends, companions and colleaguesis actually the whole of the holy life. When a monkhas admirable people as friends, companions, and col-leagues, he can be expected to develop and pursue theNoble Eightfold Path.”With the great potential benefits of a group whose membersare devoted to the attainment of liberation comes a great danger:that of substituting the quest for enlightenment with the quest forbecoming “empowered among the chosen.”146Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.147Gautama Buddha"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Appendix A95The concepts of territory and of mirror significantly contributeto the personal meaning of many important notions.Death. The personal meaning of one’s own death is something thatordinarily is not derived from one’s own direct experience of it. Thecore meaning is derived through analogy with personal impressionof the death of another. A living person has corresponding mir-rors and territories that are inherently subject to unpredictablechange at any moment. Death makes the same mirrors and terri-tories static and subject to collapse, since they no longer possessany resistance or unpredictability. The realization that one’s owndeath would result in a similar vulnerability of one’s own mirrorsand territories in others connects the idea of death with all neg-ative emotions related to a collapse of one’s own territories. “Todie” gets the meaning “to let go of all attachments.”148The lackof expressions of territories, corresponding to referent groups, dis-solves the fear of death. Instead of the above meaning, “death”ultimately should be conceptualized as “the end of the infinitelyflexible indeterminacy that is the mark of life.”Time. Personal sense of time is created in part by moments of dis-continuity in flows of the energy of free will into various territories.By consciously directing these flows into representations of territo-ries that once had active flows, one can evokedeja vuexperiences.If there are no discontinuities in the flows, sense of time disappears.A discontinuity is created by avikalpa.Self-confidence.

Some sensations or feelings (for example, estrangement,dejection, shame, scorn, humiliation, anguish, etc.) have more farreaching impact. This happens when a mentally painful sensationhas the characteristic of a trauma, due to its intensity or focus.When sensation reaches the level of trauma, the pursuit of theinhibition of such sensation is an autonomic reaction. The apparentsuccess of this reaction at attaining relief triggers conscious invoca-tion of the inhibition in the future, when the memory of the trau-matic experience is about to be recalled. Deeming such invocationas a positive action, it is incorporated into the Ego. The consciousdefense of this part of the Ego leads to a philosophical position thatvalues homeostasis. This, in turn, makes invocation of inhibition ageneralized strategy that escapes deconstruction through analysisof particular situations where the effect of inhibition turned out tobe quite negative.In order to diminish the influence of this generalized strategy,it should be understood as generalized beyond the area of originand criticized from positions that make evident the indirect andlong-term consequences of gaining short-term relief through themechanism of inhibition. Therefore, one needs to adhere to a philo-sophical system that makes clear major consequences of this sort.Total and complete awareness is to be preferred to the comfortsof inhibition. The value of the awareness should be establishedin the philosophical system in order to withstand the tides andstorms of emotions. The process of deconstruction of complexes,coagulated around painful sensation, involves pursuing the removalof the causes of the sensation without losing the awareness of thecurrent intensity of the pain. The degree of inhibition should be nohigher than required in order to be able to act and to contemplate.Sometimes a source of mentally painful sensation is a physicalpain. An important point in this case is that the physical pain,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Appendix B97that might have been a source of the mental pain, might remainin place at the time of removing the inhibition; but instead of psy-chological inhibition, physiological mechanism of pain moderationwould eventually kick in.There are three steps for removing recurring psychological in-hibition of a mentally painful feeling.1. Establish a preference of complete and uninterrupted awarenessbefore inhibition of painful sensations, be they physical or mental(that is, coming from thoughts, emotions, feelings, or from physicalpain like a wound, toothache, numbness in limbs, etc.). This isdone:a. by relating fault conditions in important activities to the lack ofawareness due to the preference of inhibition (for example, suchfault conditions might manifest themselves as sporadic blackoutscaused by a similarity, sometimes very remote, of an anticipatedcondition to the one being avoided);b. by a creative search for advantages to the total awareness fromthe point of view of valued activities;c. by questioning the anticipated benefits of the inhibition fromphilosophical positions (by analyzing how it will result in morediscomfort, pain, suffering; for example, asduh.khais a result ofignorance that will originate in the inhibition);d. by actual preference in action, even if the motive is just curiosityas to what would happen if the inhibition were actually abandoned.2. Abandon all refuges against the pain that have been taken inthe past. The refuge in this context means a wall of inhibition, thepurpose of which is the un-awareness of mentally painful sensation.Among refuges arerefuge in a person;refuge in a social hierarchy;refuge in an intoxicating substance;refuge in a repetitive, mostly predictable and absorbing activity;refuge in luck.Taking refuge results in a least temporary curtailment of awareness,since refuge adds layers of indirection to all interpretations.
