The science and philoso-phy of Ïabda Brah® encompasses the methodology and effects ofmantra-japa, prayers, collective chanting and s³dhan³s of the veda-mantras and that of the N³da Brah® deals with the genesis, expan-sion and influence of music. The volume 19 of the “Pt. ShriramSharma Acharya Vangmaya” series presents truly rare and detailedinformation and guidance on this topic. The present book is compiledfrom the English translation of the first two chapters of this volumethat focus on the cosmic dimensions of sound and the sceince ofmantras.Linguistically, the word mantra in Sanskrit implies a specific struc-ture of sonic patterns – coded in syllables and vowels, that works asan spiriutal tool to liberate the mind from ignorance, illusion and evilinstincts. The specific configurations of syllables and the correspond-ing combinations of phonemes in the mantras make the latter power-ful ‘carriers’ of the cosmic energy of sound. The book presents aperspicuous introduction with analysis of multiple aspects of the physicaland subliminal impact of sound and the structure of mantras. It alsohighlights authentic reports on scientific experiments in this direction.Different methods of rhythmic enunciation (japa) and spiritual prac-tices (s³dhan³s) of vedic mantras are described here with adeptguidance. The author, Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya also focuses onmantra yoga as an effective endeavor to master the generation andutilization, without any external means or instruments, of the immensepowers of sound for specific noble purposes. Although the vedicmantras could be well expressed vocally as prose or verse, the methodof singing them in specific rythms as hymns was given principal im-portance by the iÌis. Hence the unique spectrum of vedic swarasand the gamut of chanting patterns for mantras were evolved andencoded in the S³ma Veda.The S³ma Veda contains divine knowledge of the miraculous spiri-tual flow of music that can effectuate a vivid connection of the indi-vidual ‘self’ with thy-self. The author highlights the crucial role of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4Eternity... Science of Mantrasthis Veda and discusses the present status of the schools of s³mag³na in the context of the difficulties faced today in identifying thebest chanting patterns for the Vedic Mantras.The s³dhan³s of mantra yoga together with n³da yoga are inte-gral parts of the spiritual experiments on awakening of the KuñÃalinºand realization of the Brah® through O®k³r. These topics too arecovered here sagaciously in scientific light. The paramount role ofv³k (absolutely refined voice) in mantra yoga is emphasized withnecessary guidance. The author describes the four successively sub-tler levels of human voice (v³ñº) and presents the methods, for thecontrol and refinement of the v³ñº and mental faculties, which can bepractised by everybody in day-to-day life. These s³dhan³s graduallylead to the spiritual elevation of the v³ñº up to the supreme level – thev³k.He further illustrates – how the hidden spiritual powers of a mantraare aroused by japa through such a spiriutally empowered voice.And how the materialization of the blessings and curses also becomespossible because of the power of v³k. Authentic examples and sci-entific evidences of the modern times are presented in this book withrelevant excerpts from the scriptures to support and explain the enor-mous potentials of refined v³nº.Acharya Sharma’s elucidation of the esoteric and complex subjectmatter of Ïabda Brah® and Mantras is indeed lucid, logical andscientific.

Science of MantrasOmnipotent Role of Sound in the UniverseThe vaidika scriptures on the origin of the universe mention that theabsolute existence of the Brah® is expressed and realized in thesublime vibrations of Ïabda and N³da. The an³hat1 swar (the evo-lutionary impulse of cosmic sound) induced by these vibrations is saidto be the generator of perpetual energy in the universe. Ïabda – theomnipresent eternal origin of sound and N³da – the eternal elementof the self-existent cosmic impulse of music, immanent in the sublimi-nal as well as the gross realms of existence and their ever-evolvingexpressions in infinity are referred in the shastrik literature as ÏabdaBrah® and N³da Brah®.Ïabdaitav³da – the vaidika knowledge of absolute sound, describesthe sublime power of the omnipresent sound (Ïabda) as an eternal,limitless whole and the sole creator of the universe. Sound is regardedhere as the basic source of energy and motion existing in the uni-verse. The existence of the material world is said to have origi-nated from the cosmic impulse, the infinite bang of Ïabda. [Thebig-bang theory of the modern science agrees with this conclu-sion of the iÌis -scientists of yore]. The non-existence or abso-lute end of the world at the ultimate time – the other ‘end’ of theuniversal cycle – is also described to be a consequence of similarsupersonic explosion. On the subliminal front, the existence of enor-mous activities2 of mind is said to have been realized through theeternal medium of sound.In our day-to-day life, we generally come across with two types ofsound – vyakta (audible) and avyakta (non-audible). These are de-fined as jalp and antarjalp in the Jain scriptures. The spoken wordsfall under the first category and those expressed silently (e.g. whilethinking....) or through the language of mind are examples of the lat-ter. Acoustic theories of modern physics have characterized thesecategories in terms of frequencies of the involved ‘hard sound’. Themanifestation of the vyakta and avyakta are relative in the physicalworld. The ultra and supersonic forms are avyakta to our ears, whichcan normally sense a sound only in the frequency-range of 20 to20000 vibrations per sec. Similarly, the loud noise of a busy road"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8Eternity... Science of Mantraswould be non-audible to a person who is sitting in a closed houseaway from the road.... These examples clearly illustrate that theavyakta sound also exists in the same ‘reality’ as the vyakta one.Our cosmos consists of the sound waves in all frequency ranges ––beyond the grasp of our audio sensors and even beyond the limits ofour imagination.... Each impulse of the infinite activities of Natureindwells in the cosmos in the form of subliminal vibrations (of Ïabda)before its physical manifestation in space and time. Many animals inthis world are well equipped to perceive such subtle sounds in somerange. Several varieties of birds and animals are therefore able tosense the future events, especially, many of the natural calamities oftremor etc, that are impossible to be precognized by humans. Oftenthis ‘superhuman’ potential of animals and birds beats the advancedsensors of sophisticated instruments.The sonic vibrations of each spoken or mentally thought syllable existin the universe forever. Some frontline researchers of the modernscience of sound hope that further advancement of science and tech-nology would one day enable recording the voices (of the sages ofyore) in the omnipresent ‘ocean’ of ether.The vaidika science of mantras – the Mantra Vijó³na, developedby the iÌis had endowed them with an exceptional faculty of com-munication across the universe. This power was indeed supernormalas compared to the capabilities of the modern inventions like radio,television and radar...., etc. Mantra Vijó³na is the science of thesubliminal as well as the cosmic powers of sound. The specific con-figuration of the syllables compiled in the mantras makes them im-portant in terms of associated sonic effect. The enunciation of avedic mantra in a specific composition of accent, pitch, intensity,amplitude and rhythm results in its expansion (at a pace faster thanthe laser beams) in the endless domain of physical energy waves andconsciousness. Because of the unique property of sound to traverse(via the electro-magnetic waves) anywhere in the space, the collec-tive chanting of vaidika mantras can induce cosmic impact.Significant scientific research on the demonstration and the measure-ment of sonic energy has been carried out in the modern age of ad-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9Eternity... Science of Mantrasvanced technology. This includes pioneering research in the area ofultrasonic in the USA and Germany. The applications of ultrasonicand infrasonic technology range from strategic weapons to biomedi-cal instruments, from brainwashing to sound therapy and from tele-communications to remote control of the spacecrafts....Having realized that the energy generated by the decomposition –through japa3 of a mantra – of the cosmic sound (Ïabda) would beof exponential magnitude as compared to that of the atomic energy,some pioneering scientists have also begun an in-depth study of themantra vijó³na... However, the researchers of this field must notethat, it is the sublime effect of the mantras on the consciousness,which is more important than the gross (physical) sonic effects. Stud-ies in this direction should therefore pay greater attention on the pos-sibilities of spiritual enlightenment of all conscious beings with thehelp of mantra vijó³na.The treasure of knowledge in the Vedas is encoded in the form ofmantras and chandas (hymns). Every mantra and chanda has itssignificant importance. The G³yatrº Mantra is honored as preemi-nent in the science of spirituality and the mantra vijó³na. This ³di(absolute origin) mantra is a compilation of nine special words (inancient Sanskrit) formed by twenty four syllables. The japa of thismantra creates rhythmic pressure on the nerves and also titillates theextrasensory energy center (the six cakras) and subtle nerve-bundles(upatyik³s) that generate soothing effects in the s³dhaka’s bodyand mind and also affect his deep inner self.This absolute mantra is said to have been realized through the cos-mic vibrations of the eternal, sublime force of the omnipresent su-preme consciousness (Brahm³). This mah³mantra is referred asthe divine mother of all the Vedas and hence of all branches of knowl-edge. It is also recognized as the smallest of all religious scripturesand volumes of ultimate knowledge.... Because of its unique potentialof inspiring the individual consciousness to link with the supreme con-sciousness, the G³yatrº Mah³mantra is indeed the most powerfuland astonishing creation of Ïabda.The symbolic depiction in the shastrik literature about.... “the sevenhorses of lord Sun gaining energy from the vibrations in mahad³k³ï"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10Eternity...

This cosmic expression ofÏabda Brah®-N³da Brah® is described as the origin of the evolu-tionary impulse that resulted in the gross (perceivable) and subliminalexistence of the ever-evolving Nature and the ever-expanding Uni-verse.... This evolutionary afflatus is also described in the rhetoricpresentation of the scriptures as – the cosmic force generated by thecommingling of the Prakati and Pur¿Ìa4.The sublime vibration of the eternal sound of the self-existent abso-lute syllable “*” (Oa®) indwells everywhere in the cosmic expan-sion. The self-generation of its rhythmic impulse (O®k³r) – the ‘bigbang’, had generated the infinite spectrum of the sublime and thegross reflections of Ïabda and consequently effectuated the exist-ence and manifestation of the electromagnetic waves and the basicphysical energies of sound, heat and light.The spiritual s³dhan³s5 of the N³da-Yoga lead to the realizationof o®k³r and hence to the unfolding of the secrets of Nature anddeciphering of the hidden movements of time (past and futureevents)....During the initial stages of N³da-Yoga one has to meditate upon theinternal ‘sounds’ perceived through closed ears while sitting in anexternally silent surrounding. Long term dedicated practices of thismethod results in the experience of a variety of ‘otherwise’ non-existent sounds ranging for instance, from that of a whistle or flute toa buzzer or a big-gong; tinkling of a beetle, peeling of bells, to thenoise of the thunder bolts.... An unperturbed subliminal hummingsound (of “O®k³r) is experienced in the depths of the inner self inthe completion phase of this yoga s³dhan³. The attainment of thisultimate state of deep trance in N³da-Yoga corresponds to absoluteharmony and engrossment of the mind and the soul with the cosmicecho of Oa®....Realization and arousal of the sublime power of Ïabda Brah® -N³da Brah® immanent in the human body, mind and the inner coreof the soul are aimed in some higher levels of spiritual s³dhan³s."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Eternity... Science of MantrasAll the branches of Mantra- Vijó³na and related fields of yoga dealwith the study and practice of rhythmic enunciation of mantras anddeep meditation upon the transcendental powers of Ïabda and N³dahidden in the former. These areas of research in the science of spiri-tuality and yoga deal with the knowledge of Ïabda Brah® - N³daBrah®. The inclusion of the perennial syllable (Oa®) and its pho-neme O®k³ra is compatible as well as essential with respect to thecompilation of a mantra. Therefore, the science and philosophy ofO®k³r also fall within the vast domain of knowledge pertaining toÏabda Brah®- N³da Brah®.The Indian scriptures on yoga and spirituality mention a great deal onÏabda Brah® – as the basis of all branches of Mantra Vijó³na andthe science of the eternal syllables “ * “ (oa®), and N³da Brah® –as the source of knowledge and realization of the seven eternal notes6and the science of o®k³r and music.The elementary practices of Ïabda Yoga deal with training, controland refinement of voice and speech. Consistent attempt for obser-vance of purity, truth, precision and softness of spoken (vocally or inmental conversation via thoughts) words in day-to-day conductare prerequisites before one could initiate Ïabda Yoga. Gain-ing knowledge through sacred means like good literature, in-teraction and learning from enlightened personalities who pos-sess truth and piety of character, and transmitting it to thedeserving persons via equally noble mode is also necessary as apreliminary exercise of Ïabda Yoga. A disciple (s³dhaka) of thisspiritual s³dhan³ should realize the spoken and written words as livecarriers of thoughts, sentiments and inspirations.The N³da Yoga principle focuses upon the s³dhan³s of realizing thespiritual dignity and divine bliss of music through sincere training ofthe sh³strºya samgºta (Indian classical music).Higher level endeavors of Ïabda Yoga and N³da Yoga result in theattainment of extrasensory potentials of communication in the sub-liminal horizons of supramental intellect and super consciousness. Anaccomplished yogi of the Ïabda Yoga, can transmit his thoughts andinspirations to educe and control the minds of others at will.

Science of MantrasAstonishing Power of Ïabda – The Eternal Element of SoundWe all can easily experience the powers of hydro, thermal, electricaland wind energies in different forms. That Ïabda or any form ofsound also has similar or greater impact – cannot be believed or real-ized so clearly. Even the visible effects of music are found to varyaccording to the psychology or emotional state of the subject and aretherefore experienced in varied contexts and intensities.The scientific investigations on the existence and properties of soundwaves indicate that the effects of sound could be as physical as thoseof the other forms of energy. The Doppler Effect is worth mention-ing in this regard. The historical breaking of a bridge due to thesuperimposition of the cyclic sound created by the orderly footstepsof Napoleon’s army; Falls of several huge and stout bridges due tothe synchronization of sound of noisy winds or noises of the sur-roundings – for instance, the falls of the Lao Bernard bridge in Francein 1852 and 1871, the Ohio river’s bridge in USA in 1854 and those ofits Niagara water-fall in 1864 and 1889, the bridge over Tacoma riverin Washington, in 1940..., etc – are some of the well known ex-amples of this significant effect.Some German scientists are said to have gained, during the time offirst World War, the knowledge about the development of a weaponthat could produce sound waves of a frequency higher than 105 vibra-tions per second. Such waves would ruin the targeted persons in lessthan a second because the resultant sonic effect would destroy theneurons of the subjects at a rate faster than that due to a high powerdirect electrical shock... According to acoustic experts, even the harmonious tune of a musi-cal instrument if repeated under appropriate synchronization (in termsof frequency, amplitude, intensity and rhythm) with other musical out-put (e.g. the tinkling sound of the bells in the ankle-ornament of adancer) can result in the destruction of the stage set for the musicalperformance. Similar destructive effect could be observed by the or-derly, superimposed high-intensity audible sounds...."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Eternity... Science of MantrasOccurrences of earthquakes are also largely attributed to similar ef-fects, of periodic resonance of superimposed sound waves (at spe-cific frequencies in a specific order) deep inside the earth’s surface.It appears that the destructive power of sound could be used, in lieuof dynamite for instance, to create high-energy explosions. In orderto make constructive use of this gross effect of the amplified powersof superimposed sound waves some physicists have carried out sys-tematic experiments in advanced laboratories. One interesting ex-periment conducted in the Wastingzt-House Laboratory at New Yorkis worth citing here. An 8 ft long Iron rod of 50Kg weight was hungin the center of this laboratory. A small bottle-cork, weighing merely0.5 ounce, was also hung parallelly near the rod. The experiment wasset so that the cork would hit the rod at a constant frequency withoutany disturbance. An immediate thought in our mind would be that thehits of such a tiny cork would only result in its own destruction. Butthe facts are quite the contrary! After fifteen minutes of these peri-odic collisions the rod was found to have vibrations in it... An hourlater, the rod began to oscillate like a pendulum....If the orderly vibrations (and hence the sound) of such a tiny dimen-sions could be so powerful then one can imagine the gigantic impactof the enormous vibrations created by the ever more loud sound (rang-ing from day-to-day speech to the traffic-noise... and to the explosivesound of space crafts....., etc) produced by the living beings on theearth...; and.... by the natural collisions and (meteoritic) explosions inthe space....!Modern scientific research has gone a long way in its study of thesonic waves.

Thejourney of research from atoms to electromagnetic waves has finallybeen oriented on the fundamental and vital role of sound waves per-vaded everywhere in the cosmic expansion. The big-bang hypoth-esis of the origin of the universe is also coming closer to the ‘theories’cited in the vaidika literature.The scriptures on yoga render significant importance to Ïabda –S³dhan³, the spiritual experiment of the realization of the eternalcosmic sound, via the practices of – swara yoga, surati yogaand the mantra yoga. The science and philosophy of mantra hasemerged from the in-depth knowledge of the iÌis and their expertisein using the latent powers of Ïabda and N³da – towards fulfilling thenoble purposes of global purification and uplifting at the physical aswell as the spiritual levels. This is the reason why in case of everymantra, it is the pattern and strength of vibrations and energygenerated by its japa and not its linguistic structure, grammar orthe word-meaning that play the key role in making the mantra soeffective..."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Eternity... Science of MantrasThe vaidika mantras are said to have been created as specific con-figuration of phonemes and syllables corresponding to the ‘sonicpattern’ of the enormous expressions of the subliminal vibrationsof the afflatus of the Brah® as realized by the riÌis in the state ofdeep trance.Sonic energy, being a physical manifestation of Ïabda exists in itsoriginal form in the universe forever, without any natural conversioninto any other form of energy. The subtle vibrations and impact ofmantra is therefore regarded as eternal.In scientific terms, the vibrations in any material form or in the ethericmedium constitute the fundamental source of existence and manifes-tation of sound. As we all know, the quavering of the wires of amusical instrument creates specific vibrations in the medium in thevicinity of these wires; due to this, the air (particles) around is firstcompressed and then spread periodically according to the frequencyof these vibrations. The sound so generated is carried along the entireexpansion of the medium.The vibrations carried via the air medium are audible (i.e. recognizedby the sensors of our ears) if they fall into the frequency range of 16to 20,000 cycles per second in general. Upon perception by the nerve-sensors in the ears, these vibrations are transmitted – through appro-priate electrical signals, to the neural system in our brain and thecorresponding sound is ‘heard’ by us. The presence of the mediumof air is essential for the normal functions of hearing by the ears in ahuman body. For most of the marine animals, the medium of waterfulfils this purpose. In some creatures the centers for perception andtransmission of sound are located along the skin pores or elsewherein the body instead of the ears.The position (vis-à-vis their connections with specific centers in thebrain) of our two ears helps instantaneous hearing of the audible soundand the recognition of the direction from where it is arriving. How-ever, despite optimal functioning state of the brain and the ears, wecannot hear the infra sound – produced by the vibrations of frequen-cies much lower than 16 cps, and the ultrasound – generated by vi-brations of frequencies much higher than 20,000 cps. Moreover, eventhe sound belonging to the audible frequency-range, but produced at"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16Eternity... Science of Mantrasa long distance or in a noisy surrounding, would not be heard by ourears; because, the disturbances in the air-medium would perturb itsoriginal vibrations in such cases.The orderly expansion of the sound waves (vibrations) of compatiblecharacteristics produces well structured sonic patterns while a disor-der converts them into a noise (in terms of communication signals).The velocity (around 1088 ft per sec) of sound is much lesser thanthat of light. This is the reason why the flash of lightening is seenbefore the loud noise of a thunder bolt.....; or..., smoke produced by acannon is seen before the cracking sound of its explosion is heard......‘How far a sound will be heard or received by a sensor that is perceptiveto its frequency’– depends upon its intensity and loudness. The larger isthe intensity, the lesser would be the effect of distance.... For example,the noise of a volcano, exploded in Indonesia in 1883, was heard up to adistance of over 5000 miles in open air.The propagation of the sound is hindered or reflected back whenever itscarrier medium is blocked. This gives rise to an echo or to a dispersedsound depending upon the (atomic) structure and shape of the obstacle.The quality (loudness and amplitude) of the reverberation depends uponthe type of the original sound and the regularity and geometry of thedense medium (or the obstruction) with which the sound waves collide.At times, the sound produced at one place and perceived within a certainrange can be heard beyond an intermediate region of its non-perception.For instance, an explosion that took place in Moscow sometime in 1920sbecame popular because, its noise was heard up to 60 miles but not at adistance from 60 to 90 miles. Amazingly, it was clearly heard at a dis-tance of another 60 miles forward (i.e. within the distance from 91 to 121miles approximately) from the place where it occurred.Propagation of sound via radio waves amplifies its velocity up to theorder of 186000 miles per second or more. This is how the radiostations can communicate from one end of the globe to the other in amatter of few seconds. Marching ahead from the knowledge andutilization of radio waves, the modern science and technology haveadvanced up to the level of capturing as well as generating infra soundand ultrasound with the help of sophisticated instruments. The presentcentury might enable experimentation on still higher dimensions ofsound and pave the way for experiencing the yet ‘hidden’ realms ofits sublime existence.***"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17Eternity... Science of MantrasConstructive Applications of Sound in the Modern AgeThe discovery of radio waves had created revolution in the scientificdevelopment of the modern world. Research on ultrasound andinfrasound has given it a big leap towards the new horizons of ad-vanced technology.The pulse-echo method for testing of metals was developed in 1940-‘50 based on Prof. Dazisch’s research on ultrasonic waves. Contem-porary research on ultrasound has led to multifaceted applications inengineering and sciences.Use of ultrasound – in noninvasive technologies like the EMR,sonography and ultrasonic surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment ofdiseases like arthritis, gall-stone and in complicated surgical opera-tions has taken a predominant place in the medical technology today.Amongst the recent experimental studies, the research works of Dr.Luxel in Sweden, Dr. J.C. Taylor in England and Dr. Toshio Bogoi inJapan have shown promising use of ultrasonics in the neurologicaldisorders as well.The visible as well as the subtle effects of infra-sound are found to bemore powerful in the field of communications than those of the au-dible or ultrasound. The radio waves could be used only throughappropriate transistors. This limitation has been overcome by the in-vention of microwaves and other infrasonic waves. The special useof infrasound lies in the acquisition of distant (in time and space) andlow frequency signals and is therefore of specific importance intelematics and advanced telecommunication technology. Accordingto Dr. Joseph Todd, a radiologist in the Univ. of California at LosAngeles, infrasonic radio waves could also be sent or received vianeurological signals. Nature possesses many live examples to sup-port his claims.The frantic running around by animals like cats, dogs, rabbits...etc.,hours before the occurrence of an earthquake in the nearby area –indicates the capabilities of these animals in sensing the infrasonicvibrations deep below the earth’s surface.

Somespecies of elephants and fin whales are found to make efficient useof infrasonic signals for deciding the direction of their future move-ments....The presence of an infrasonic effect, due to its subtle nature, is oftenlinked with ‘mysterious’ events. One such interesting phenomenon isassociated with the research of Prof. Govard Marceillis of Vienna.He used to feel dull and restless with nausea while working in theoffice in his properly clean and airy chamber. This had started hap-pening every day since several months. Mysteriously, his conditionwould become normal as soon as he came out of the particular cham-ber.... His body and mind were in good health otherwise.

It was found that the noise ofan air-conditioner (fitted several months ago) in the adjacent roomgives rise to these vibrations.....; the frequency of these micro-scalevibrations was found to measure around 07 hertz, which was gener-ating infrasonic waves in the chamber of the Professor.Prof. Govard then carried out intensive research on microwaves. Hedeveloped an instrument to generate infrasonic waves. To his sur-prise, during several experiments, he observed that these waves werecapable of penetrating the bodies of the guinea pigs and, due to theirhigh energy fields, were capable of liquidating the solid constituentsthere in a fraction of a second. During a demonstration of the powerof infrasonic waves – when he operated his machine to generatesuch waves in an open ground...., the glasses of the concrete build-ings in the surroundings were found to have broken almost instanta-neously and the inhabitants of the buildings complained of headaches,irritation, nausea and tension during this experiment."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19Eternity...

How-ever, if misused this power would be equally detrimental.... Noisepollution is among the major health-hazards being faced by the worldtoday.

According to a report of the interna-tional symposium on environment organized in Stockholm by the UNO– ‘if a human being has to live constantly in a noisy atmosphere wherethe intensity of sound is more than 140 decibels then he would soonloose the normal mental balance...; further higher levels of intensitiesof this sound would result in his untimely death’.It is found that, on an average, the intensity (in decibels) of soundproduced by normal conversation is around 60, that of quarreling voiceis about 80. The average intensity of the noisy sound of a motorbikemeasures around 100, that of a siren of a factory about 150, aircraftabout 160 decibels...., etc. The collective impact of these disturbingsounds is found to explosively damaging and more dangerous for ourecosystem than the pollution of air and water.Scientific Studies on Noise Pollution:Scientific investigations reveal that the stimulation created by the soundwaves of intensities higher than 25-30 decibels at a continuous stretchcan perturb the normal bio-electrical signal-processing of the nervoussystem and hence should be regarded as risky... Maintenance of si-lent ambience in hospitals, especially around the heart-patients and inthe intensive care units is therefore mandatory.Contemporary experimental research on guinea pigs as well as onthe human subjects carried out in the acoustics, medicine and neuro-psychological research laboratories across the world – in the 20thcentury, has shown significant mal-effects of loudness of sound onclinical, physiological and psychological behavior of the subjects. Theleading projects include – the experiments conducted at San Fran-cisco medical college, California; Dr. William F.

During the construction of aplane field near Leningrad, some time in 1963, it was observed thatthe loud noise of the bulldozers had caused a sudden fall of the feath-ers of the hens in a nearby poultry farm. The loud ‘voice’ of supermagnet fighter aircrafts had produced cracks in the historic caves ofKenyan. Many other historical monument around the world are fac-ing similar dangers due to the noise pollution created by the traffics orthe heavy industrial operations in the areas around.The intensity of sound has a key role to play at the cellular and mo-lecular level as well. Dr. Dailhastize’s research carried out at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that the coagula-tion of the RBCs increases with the loudness of sound in the sur-rounding environment. This results in narrowing down of the arteriesand increasing their rigidity. Similar results were obtained at the Schoolof Engineering and Applied. Sciences, UCLA during a study of theeffects of noise, the negative effects of the loudness of sound in thebig cities were found to have caused liver diseases in the adults andaffected the would-be-born children of the pregnant women – suchinfants were born with physiological and anatomical abnormalities ofone kind or the other.While the appropriate ordering and controlling of the frequency andintensity in music creates soothing effects of strengthening the healthyfunctioning of the body and the mind, any disordering in it could proveto be equally harmful. For instance the electronic strain gauge testsconducted by an acoustic, Dr. John Diamond, have indicated thatsome combinations and tuning of the ‘Da... Da....Da....’ in a noisypop music can ruin about two-third of the muscle-strength of its lis-teners. The sound (though subtle in nature) produced by evil thoughtsand sentiments like jealous, ego, anxiety, anger – generated by exces-sive ambitions, possessive desires or attachments – fall into the sec-ond category. Those desirous of living a happy, healthy and long lifeshould attempt creating a noise- free atmosphere in their external andthe internal world. Silence in the surroundings and a peaceful state ofmind are evidently crucial for the success of any kind of yoga or spiritualpractice.***"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22Eternity...

Thisprompted geographical investigations... It was found that, long ago(some time in 1450 BC), the major portions of the island had gotimmersed in the Atlantic ocean; the geological movements of thesame and disturbances thereby create vibrations (measurable by sen-sitive seismographic instruments) that result in generating infrasonicwaves around Santonini.During the peak of the Cold-War times, some Russian scientists hadconducted experiments in which they had sent infrasonic signals toseveral parts, esp. in the factory-/ mining- areas, of Canada. Thishad put millions of people, esp. laborers in the factories or themineworkers, into unusual states of mental depressions, dullness andlethargy for several days.. This naturally affected the factory- andthe mining operations and created serious problems... Canada hadraised this issue at international forums to prevent recurrence of suchghastly trials. Similar infrasonic ‘attacks’ of the Russians were re-ported in Alaska. The American defense-scientists had retaliated bytransmitting equivalent low frequency anti-waves.The weapons capable of transmitting infrasonic radiation at targetedspots of strategic importance in the enemy’s camp are the mostdreaded and ghastly, as they can virtually paralyze the opponents fora desired period of time during the war – without leaving a clearevidence of this inhumane act.

The s³tvika mantras are sources ofoverall refinement of the physical as well as spiritual domains of life.The s³dhan³s of such vedic mantras bestow individual and globalwelfare in the truest sense. The t³ntrika mantras posses tremen-dous potential that could be employed as ‘mechanized’ device toaffect specific targets – be that mind or matter.... If misused, thenegative effects of the t³ntrik mantras could be disastrous for theuser and the target both.The human body and mind constitute a super advanced scientific labo-ratory. The founders of the mantra vijó³na used to conduct experi-ments in this fantastic bequest of Nature.According to the ancient philosophy of mysticism (rahasyav³da) –Ïabda is eternal and is the fundamental perpetual force that effectu-ated the creation of the universe. The blueprint of any event that isgoing to happen anywhere in the cosmic expansion first occurs in theform of the vibrations of Ïabda in the ocean of its omnipresent N³da.The experts of mantra vijó³na were able to ‘perceive’ these sub-liminal vibrations and could therefore ‘visualize’ the future eventswith ease. The sole aim of their experiments with the mantras was– cognition of the absolute truth and using its ultimate knowledge fordivine illumination of the world....Our body is defined in the ancient scriptures as a manifestation ofspecific reactions of Ïabda. With this perceptions, the rhythmic cas-cade of bodily functions could be termed as a bio-swing, moving ac-cording to the set frequency (like that of a radio) of Ïabda. When allthe components of this gigantic ‘sonic’ device of our body (and mind)are harmonized, we are in fine health and mood and work in perfec-tion according to its natural frequency.The modern experts like Dr. Steven Hypern, director, Spectrum Re-search Inst., California, opine that – we all live in an ocean of sound,some vibrations of which are compatible with our own frequency."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25Eternity...

In his scientific experiments he had demon-strated the liquifying of steel plates by the effect of sound waves. Inyet another experiment, he had produced a compound of this liquid bymixing powdered plastic and some metals under superimposed ef-fects of similar sound waves. By controlled sonic vibrations on thiscompound he reconstructed the plates whose upper surfaces nowhad a transformed appearance.Dr. Hans has developed a tonosope based on the principles of sonictransformations. The sounds received by the input microphone ofthis instrument are converted into visual images on the output screens.He has invented that Oa®7 is a mantra that generates very specificgeometrical images on the tonoscope. (Remarkably, these imagescorrespond to the Sanskrit syllable used to represent this unique sound).He concludes that the specific vibrations of mantras and the specificpatterns of their japa – as invented by the Indian seers of yore –must have been great source of generation of immense energy, men-tal inspiration and consequent multifaceted development of happy andhealthy society.If a stone is thrown in a silent water pond then circular waves, mov-ing in the transverse directions, are generated on its surface. Simi-larly, any vibration in the etheric ocean generates sound waves in thecosmos. These waves move longitudinally in all directions forming avirtual ‘sphere’ of vibrations in the space....

Science of MantrasImpact of Ïabda on Mind and Intrinsic CharacterThe physical world consists of five basic forms of energies, viz. sound,light, heat, electricity and magnetism. They are convertible into eachother and follow the universal law of conservation of energy. Hence,logically, they all could be regarded as different manifestations of aunique perpetual energy.The Indian philosophy and science of spirituality describes a uniquecosmic energy – the Supreme Consciousness, as immanent in everyform of life and physical energy. This omnipresent subliminal energyis said to have generated from Ïabda. Its genesis and absolute ex-pansion is known as Ïabda Brah® – N³da Brah®. The eternalsource of this cosmic sound is referred as the an³hat n³da of Oa®.Enormous manifestations of the powers of sound – including that ofrefined voice (v³ka ïakti) are said to be the manifestations of thisan³hat swar of Ïabda.The significance of speech – is experienced by all of us in our day-to-day life in terms of the ‘reactions’ to the ‘spoken words’. This givesus a glimpse of the marvelous role of the gross (physical) manifesta-tion of the sonic energy of Ïabda. The history of human society hasample examples illustrating this power of syllables and sound.Few words (spoken or written) of inspiration can enthuse a soldier towin the losing battle. The terrific effect of Mr. Winston Churchill’s‘V for Victory’ motto had changed the fate of England in the IIndworld war. Similar events were associated with the power of thecourageous words of the little Corporal, Napoleon Bonnapart. Thepower of syllables is electrified by the inner strength and confidencewith which they are spoken. The motivating slogans like..... “TumMujhe Kh¿na Do Main Tumhe Âz³dº D¿ng³” expressed by Mr.Subhash Chandra Bose and “Swar³ja Ham³r³ Janma SiddhaAdhik³ra Hai” by Lokmanya Tilak....., have installed glorious phaseof Indian independence movement and are still alive.Mahatma Gandhi’s speeches had a power to hypnotize the listeners;to drive millions of people, even though these speeches would not be"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28Eternity...

Few scornful words of Draupadi hadtriggered the ego of Duryodhana...., and thus resulted in the devas-tating war of Mahabharata. This last example clearly signifies thecalamitous effects of the negative use of the immense power of Ïabda.In the language of anatomy, the ‘hearing and speech’ (including thespeech of thoughts, i.e. thinking and imagination) system gets toppriority in the brain and occupies about 50 to 60 % portion of ourbrain’s active (functioning) area. The functions of the creative ac-tivities of the hands get the next priority and so on.....We also shouldgive top priority to controlling the words spoken, written or heard(and hence ‘stored’ in the memory) by us – to avoid the misuse of theprecious power of our brain. Spiritual disciplines indeed give crucialimportance to the practices of satsa®ga, sa®yam, swadhy³ya andmanana for enhancing the purity, integrity, austerity and piety of hear-ing, speaking, reading, writing and thinking.At higher levels of spiritual refinement, the power of spoken, thought-of or written forms of the gross manifestation of Ïabda expressesitself in terms of the effective blessings or curses. The iÌis used tohear, speak and think absolute truth and were therefore endowedwith the supernormal talents of using this power at will. The birth ofLord Ram and his brothers by Ïringi iÌi’s blessings and the death ofKing Parºkïit due to the curse of Lomesh iÌi – are some of the well-known examples in this context available in the ancient Indian scriptures.Most importantly, the latent power of Ïabda stimulates the subtlenuclei of consciousness inside our body and has significant effect onour mind. The auspicious words – e.g., the prayers offered to divinepowers, the holy quotes or the preaching of great saints, createcorresponding positive effects on our mind and sentiments. Sa-cred thoughts and deeds are directly linked with such boons.

Science of MantrasElements of the Science of VowelsBefore going into the details of mantra vijó³na let us focus here onthe sonic power of some basic vowels used in the Sanskrit andDevanagari Languages. Whatever be the type of our language, wedo come across with a large number of such accents (and their pho-nemes) or various combinations of these in our day-to-day conversa-tions. Because of the special sonic effects, the proper use of thebasic vowels and syllables of the ancient Sanskrit language can also beregarded as an elementary exercise in Ïabda Yoga. The properties of some of these basic vowels are as follows:a: Pronunciation of this vowel has a direct, though subtle, impact onthe heart. The pumping action of the heart – especially its operationof exhaling pure blood – is supported by this accent. Repeated loudenunciation of this vowel at constant amplitude helps regulate thesupply of pure blood from the heart to various part of the body. Inmantra vijó³na this vowel is regarded to possess creative power.³: The sound of this vowel affects the chest and the upper parts ofthe lungs. Its impact strengthens the upper ribs, helps clean the di-gestive canal and also energizes the mind. Controlled and repeatedenunciation of this vowel would be very useful towards the cure ofasthma and chronic cough.i - º: Stretched pronunciation of these has a direct positive effect onthe throat and its connections with the brain. This activates upperchamber of the heart. Cleaning of the respiratory tract and the intes-tines is performed by regular stimulation by the continuous sound ofthese sharp vowels. People suffering from chronic headaches or car-diac ailments should benefit from consistently exercising the repeated‘chanting’ of these vowels. Short-tempered or mentally depressedpersons are also advised to follow the practice of rhythmic recitationof these accents.u - ¿: Pronunciation of these vowels has direct positive impact onthe organs in the middle and the lower part of the body – namely, theliver, stomach and the lower intestine. It reduces the weight of thebelly. Constipation can be cured by regular recitation of these vowels"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31Eternity... Science of Mantrasover a continuous stretch of time. Women suffering from the dis-eases of the abdomen would also benefit from such exercises.e - ai: The sound of these vowels has an impact on the kidney andalso on the junction of the throat and the respiratory tract. Repeatedpronunciation of these vowels helps cure of renal (urinary) diseases.Rhythmic enunciation of these strengthens the soft membranes in-side the vocal cord and hence it is very useful for the singers orteachers who have to sing/speak, at a constant pace, for relativelylonger intervals of time.o - au: The natural functioning of genital organs and the musclesand veins of its peripherals are strengthened by the sound of thesevowels. The regular practice of chanting these vowels also stimu-lates the central part of the chest and is useful in supporting the cureof pneumonia and pleurisy.a®: Inhaling of oxygen with the humming sound of this vowel indeedhelps increase one’s vital energy. It also activates healthy increase inthe RBCs and purifies the blood. The practice of pr³ñ³y³ma is anintegral part of all yoga exercises; prolonged pronunciation of ‘a®’is the root of perfection in the former. While pronouncing the ‘a’ partof this vowel our lips and mouth are kept open and the lips are closedat the time of ‘®’.... This should be practised with a feeling that – allour evils have gone out in the first phase and we have closed their re-entry in the second phase. Regular practice of this simple exercise isvery beneficial for psychological uplifting too.a¡: Its pronunciation titillates the tongue and the upper frontal part ofthe palate and creates useful conduction effects in the brain. Reci-tation of this vowel under deep meditation stimulates the secretion ofspecific hormones that regulate the harmonious functioning of all com-ponents/organs of the body. Open laughter also serves repeated enun-ciation of this vowel. This is the secret of the “laughing exercise”being so effective a remedy against stress and depression.Apart from inducing positive effects on the body and the mind, spe-cific practices of chanting these basic vowels (accents) help spiritualdevelopment as well. These aspects are covered in the context of N³daYoga and Music."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32Eternity... Science of MantrasRelation of Vocal Sound with the Panca Tatvas8:Prof. Dobson and some other linguists have hypothesized that theprimary speech of human race must have originated in the form of averse because rhythm and accent of the vocal presentations seemto be universal vis-à-vis their implications in any language. Prof.Dobson had got this idea after observing that – if he would recitea French poesy before his German students and German poesy infront of French-speaking students, both the groups of students wereable to get the central idea and feels of the poems. Whereas theprose in the same foreign languages were non-comprehensible to thesestudents.That phonemes (and sound in general) would have a relation withmatter (which belongs to the pathvº tatva) is obvious from the factthat when any kind of material form is beaten it produces vibrations.The type of vibrations (and hence the quality of sound generated bythem...) produced by the same impact of beating would be differentfor different types and shapes of matter. For example, the soundproduced by a thin wire of sit³ra is different from that of the leather-sheet of a dholaka....., etc.The role of air (which belongs to the v³yu tatva in the group of thefive basic elements) as a medium for the realization and propagationof sound is well known. The controlling effect of air in maintainingthe quality and type of sound is also obvious – as seen in whistling orin playing of the musical instruments like flute. The use of water as amedium for communication by several marine species and also insome musical instruments (like the jal taranga) similarly explainsthe relationship of sound with the jal tatva.The physical relationship of sound with heat and light – constituentsof the agni tatva, can be seen/ measured with the help of the scien-tific instruments like the retrometer, spectrometer and the tonoscope.The implications of their subtle relationship are well experienced bymost of us in our day-to-day life; for example, ‘the heated exchangeof words in quarreling ...’ or, ‘the enlightenment of mind by an inspir-ing lecture.... ‘, etc.That sound reflected in the form of music affectsour sentiments – is an evidence of its relationship with the subtlest,the cosmic element – ³k³ïa tatva.As the universe in general, and the individual being – i.e., the body,mind and the manifestation of consciousness in it, in particular, is"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33Eternity... Science of Mantrasconstituted by the panca tatvas, its intimate relationship with soundis quite natural.In fact, our body as a whole and especially the vocal cord is like asophisticated musical instrument. Its thin muscles, membranes andother particles get vibrations from the apatatva; when we speak, thecurrents of apatatva are received from the omnipresent sonic powerof N³da around us. When we think, this sublime element is gener-ated by the Ïabda, which is indwelling in the conscious core of ourmind. This is the reason why our mind talks to itself while in thethought process....The infinite dimensional apatatva is immanent in the ³k³ïa tatva.This is also regarded as the source of the physical existence of soundin our space. However, the presence of other four basic tatvas af-fects its realization in the eternal form. The human mind has so farexperienced/ recognized about forty-nine different kinds of naturalphonemes swaras – seven of which are regarded as the basic vow-els and the others are komal (soft) and tºvra (high notes) configura-tions of them. Various combinations of these swaras have been com-piled into eight basic r³gas (classical tunes of shastriya music) andso on..... The gamut of phonemes and varieties of sounds (musical orotherwise) have been generated thereby.The panca tatvas existing in these varieties of sound do affect ourbody and mind according to their own natural properties. Excessivepresence of agni tatva in the sound heard or produced by us enlight-ens our pr³ña by a subtle red color and gives physical effects likethat of the thermal energy and the psychological stimulation.... Simi-larly, the jal and the v³yu tatva offer blue and white colors of pr³ña,pathvº tatva induces yellow color and the ³k³ï tatva} absoluteblack... Each generates associated impulses in the physical andemotional environments.What is important for us to understand from the above descriptions is– the significance of the immense power of Ïabda and its intimateeternal relationship with our life. With this, we must begin to makeour speech and thoughts as pure and true as possible. This would beour first step towards the realization of the paramount significance ofsound as a manifestation of Ïabda.***"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34Eternity... Science of MantrasThe Ïabda YogaThe Vedas specify that – “Lord Brahma (the Supreme Creator) ex-pressed thy wish in sublime sound of Ïabda, to manifest thyself inthe infinity... Whence the universe came into existence....”. Theother religious scriptures like the holy Kur³na mentions – ‘Khud³(the Supreme Power) said.... “Be...” and All that happened....’; and“The Angel” states –– ‘The absolute word (sound) was there whennothing was there... All has originated from thy word (eternalsound)....’.The above maxims imply the eternal power of Ïabda at the origin ofeverything.Our internal or external desire expresses itself (to our own self or tothe others) via the medium of words, which, themselves are nothingbut manifestations of Ïabda. If the desire has emerged from thesoul then its expression will be embedded with the true power of theÏabda Brah®. Such an inner wish will not remain unfulfilled pro-vided the dissipation of its power – due to our negative feelings andthoughts – does not reduce the original impact of the former. Often,our lack of confidence in our own self or our materialistic cravingsand attachments, passions and untoward thoughts subtly disturb ourmind and induce the negative effects of this sort with the acceleratingforce of the evil instincts and assimilated untoward tendencies.We must realize that our consciousness is a part of the divine con-sciousness.....

The psychological effects of the latter areenormous.... There is also a close relationship in the Ïabda of ourconscious and the subconscious mind.... For instance, whenever wetalk about or hear of a natural calamity or an epidemic..., ourmind simultaneously starts thinking about it via the language ofimaginations.... and vice-versa. The elementary yoga practicesof self-hypnotism are indeed based on a creative utilization of thisrelationship and have been found very effective in improving one’spsychology.There is a saying in Sanskrit – ‘Yath³ Manas³ Manute Tath³ V³c³Vadati’; meaning– as we think so we speak. Our mind (conscious aswell as subconscious) never remains silent. It keeps talking to itselfeven when we are silent.... These thoughts continue to leave theirsubtle impressions in our overall personality. Sometime the thoughtswill also leave an instant impact on our face-expressions. Often,the state of mind (or mood) can be ‘read’ through such face ex-pressions. For example, it shows wrinkles on the fore-head in the stateof tension....; a blushing face becomes pink...; face turns yellow in thestate of real fear... etc. Some spiritual saints and yogis can know one’soverall character just by reading the subtle expression of his thoughts(and the internal desire at the root of these thoughts) on his face.Realizing the psychological importance of Ïabda we must, at least,begin to speak, hear and think in a manner that will have positiveeffects on our mind. Cautious use of words and thoughts may beregarded as the first step towards the practice of Ïabda Yoga.

The words spoken by someone would becomeabsolute if his baikhari v³ñº is empowered by the païyanti. Spiri-tual endeavors of Ïabda Yoga and V³ka Siddhi include purificationand training to effectuate this evolution of v³ñº. The japa of man-tras are perfect only if uttered through such a refined voice.As mentioned earlier, the creation (compilation) of mantras is basedon a splendid combination of the science of syllables and vowelsemanated from the realization of Ïabda Brah® and the science ofthe rhythmic impact of specific patterns of phonemes and musicalnotes – the science of N³da Brah®. The effectiveness of the v³cikajapa of mantras is proportional to the spiritual refinement of thebaikhari v³ñº. The consistent observance of truth, austerity, pietyand selflessness in thoughts, deeds and conduct is essential for effec-tive success in the practices of mantra-japa. A mantra recited in aspiritually refined voice is said to be perfect like the unfailing arrow ofthe G³ñÃºva – the divine bow of Arjuna.Our body is also like a superb musical instrument gifted by Nature.In fact, its functional structure can be simulated with the vºñ³ andsit³ra. These instruments have several wires connected with thewooden components. Analogously, the brain, tongue, stomach etc to-gether with the tactile skin, vocal cord, ears and the network ofinterconnected nerves constitute our body’s instrument. This mu-sical body (termed G³tra Vºñ³ in the scriptures) is well equippedwith the sensors for receiving and transmitting enormous varieties ofsonic currents.The swara (accent) of the musical notes is generated in the G³traVºñ³ of our body by vibrations in the specific cakras and energyplexus described earlier.

Science of Mantraslike the vºñ³ and sit³ra. The experts of Yoga Vidy³ too, by thededicated s³dhan³s of N³da Brah®, ‘play’ (stimulate) the ÌaÚ cakrasand generate vibrations in the ‘fibers’ (latent linkages) of the innerbody. This induces spiritual transmutation and arousal of supernatu-ral powers (riddhi-siddhis) of physical as well as transcendentaldimensions.Perfection in listening and tuning the N³da of the living vºñ³ of ourbody helps understand and regulate the gross physical as well as thesubtle functions of our life. This expertise could be attained rathereasily by N³da Yoga as compared to other ascetic and endurings³dhan³ procedures of yoga. The sapt deva (seven Gods), sapta iÌis (the seven iÌis), saptloka (seven heavenly realms of existence),sapt s³gara (seven ‘oceans’ of life), sapt meru (seven mountains ofdivinity), sapt s³dhan³s (seven levels of spirituality) –– existing inthe subtle world of our body – are said to vibrate according to thedivine sapt swaras (the octave of cosmic music of eternity) gener-ated by the N³da Brah®.A group of distinguished scientists in Toronto (Canada) has initiatedinnovative research on the ‘sounds’ within the human body. Theirsound-proof laboratory is well equipped to perceive and make au-dible, the different sounds produced by the processes of respiration,heart beating, flows of liquids and gases in the digestive system....,etc. The analysis of the rhythmic interplay between these soundsand the physical state of the body has offered them significant infor-mation. Similar research in modern branches of audition and acous-tics should also be carried out to scientifically analyze the psychologi-cal factors with respect to the gamut sounds inside the body.Renowned physicist, Dr. Charles G. Van Ripher has thrown light onthe subtler aspects of the internal sounds of the human body in hisbook entitled – ‘An Introduction to General American Phonetics’. Inhis views, the mysterious levels of consciousness could be graspedonly by understanding the spectrum of sonic (audible as well as sub-liminal) vibrations of the living system. Prof. Ripher states that – aslight, heat, gravity and magnetism affect the physical phenomena inNature and the states of the living bodies in it, similar or even highershould be the impact of the sound energy because it ‘enfolds’ the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39Eternity... Science of Mantrasoptical and the thermal energies as well. The presence of some mini-mum level of sound, including that produced due to the continuum ofperiodic physiological functions, is as essential for maintaining bio-energy, as that of air, water and food.From their physical appearance, the muscles appear as mere bundlesof ‘threads’ made up of blood and flesh.... However, the sounds pro-duced by their periodic contraction and stretching are wonderful. Onecan sense these sounds by meditating upon the intra-body functions –without any disturbance of any kind of external sound. Perfectingsuch meditations enables one perceive these sounds in the happy andhealthy state of the mind and body as melodious tunes produced bythe divine vºñ³. This sound loses its order and becomes unclear in thenegative states of tension, anger, sickness, etc.Some of the sounds produced by various physiological and physico-chemical functions inside the body can be amplified and heard orsensed with the help of the modern instruments like theechocardiogram. With the advent of technology for perception ofinfra- and ultra-sounds, some scientists have been able to recordand analyze the above mentioned sounds produced by the musclesand other parts of the body. Celebrities like Dr. Joshua F. Jaffeof the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, has successfully recordedsome of these sound waves – up to 1000 hertz frequencies – withthe help of an electro-mechanical stethoscope. His recordingsinclude the orderly echos (sounding like “Lap-Dap - Lap-Dap” ....)of the heart beats and the grumbling sound produced in the lungs.Prof. G. I. Taylor’s auto-correlation studies carried out at the Cam-bridge University have provided in-depth quantitative analysis of thewaveforms of the signals recorded during the controlled experimentson intra-body sounds. Using the computational methods of Fast Fou-rier Transforms, Prof. James W.

Dr.Nelson of the Zoology department, California University has investi-gated that – if a shark is in a state of danger, her ‘shout’ for help issent to her partners via the signals of her muscles’ sound; the friendsat the other end also communicate via similar signals. Dr. M. A. Winseyof Britain obtained analogous results when he experimented on theeggs of Japanese Quails. He found that the sound waves transmittedfrom an egg are heard by its mother about four days before the birthof the offspring. He also observed that if an embryo of this quail iskept in a transperent plastic bag near its egg, in which, an offspring isstruggling hard to come out ...., then, the orderly sound producedinside the embryo would send ‘energy signals’ to help the offspringbreak the shell of its egg with greater ease...... An experimental Zo-ologist, Dr. Goldpink, concludes that – such phenomena are the ‘dem-onstration’ of the fact that the conscious energy in a living body isindeed a part of an omnipresent (supreme) force.In his dissertation entitled ‘Phisicomathice de L’humane’ an Italianscientist, Dr. Francisco M. Grimaldy has thrown light on some yetunknown (hence ‘mysterious’!) features of the music of the body’svºñ³. He considers the specific pattern of the body-sounds of a per-son to be correlated with his psychology and sentiments. His empha-sis on the emotional and sentimental aspects brings his theory closerto the philosophy of our ancient scholars.

Science of MantrasThe Suprasonic Power Hidden in MantrasMantra Vijó³na as developed by the iÌis – the Indian sages ofyore, is a science based on the realization of the omnipotent power ofÏabda – the eternal sound.Mantra Cikits³ has been an important branch of ancient IndianMedicine. This is a sublime sound therapy and science of healing ofthe body and the mind derived from the principles of Mantra Vijó³na.Even today, the use of this ‘esoteric’ mode of treatment is quite popu-lar – especially in the interior parts of India, for eliminating the poi-sonous effects of biting by the snakes, scorpions, dogs or lizards etc.Mantra therapy is also applied here for curing a variety of diseasesincluding jaundice, typhoid, epilepsy, hysteria ... etc. An article en-titled ‘Ïabda Brah® K³ Pratºka Mantra’ is worth mentioning in thiscontext. In this article (c.f. The Hindi digest ‘K³dambinº’; Decem-ber ‘67; pp. 18-), the author, Shri Govinda Shastri has also describedone such incident in detail where he had witnessed a complete andquick (just in two days!) cure of severe jaundice by the mantra cikits³.The following quote of Yoga VaïiÌÚha (Ïloka no. 6|1|8|1|39) throwslight on the power of Mantra Cikits³:Yath³ Vireka Kurvanti Harºtakya Swabh³vata¡ |Bh³van³vaïata¡ K³rya That³ Paralav³daya¡ ||Meaning: As Harra (a medicinal herb) activates the digestive sys-tem by almost instantaneous cleaning of the stomach, the enunciation– accompanied by thorough mental concentration and faith, of thespecial syllables like “Ya”, “Ra”, “La”, “Va”..., of the mantras alsocreate definite effects on the body.The limitless power of Ïabda enfolded in the specific compilation ofthe Vaidika Mantras was deeply realized by the rishis.

Prof."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43Eternity... Science of MantrasBever, a noted scholar from Germany, has also expressed similar opinionabout the immense subliminal power indwelling in the mantras.The quality of sound we hear in different ways does have a directbearing upon our mental and emotional reactions. This could be seenin our day-to-day encounters too. For example, the roaring sound of alion or the trumpeting of an elephant does create a feeling of feareven if it is heard for the first time or even if the listener does notrecognize ‘what sound is that?’ Similar is true of the ‘irritating’ voiceof a crow. On the contrary, whenever heard, the sweet warbling soundof a nightingale is going to generate soothing effects only.... The la-tent vibrations of Ïabda immanent in every kind of sound, can stir theocean of surrounding energy waves to separate out and expunge theforces of opposite (insidious) quality....Mantra Cikits³ is indeed a science based on the deep understandingof the latent power of Ïabda and its intimate relationship with theconsciousness and the vital energy centers in the body. Beforegoing into the details of the structure and functional mechanismsof mantras, let us consider the evidential examples of the power ofsound in terms of the wide range of its applications in modern medicaltechnology.Whenever a bell is struck, its chiming continues for some time be-cause of the vibrations in the atoms of the material of which the bellis made.... Almost infinitely many types (i.e. different frequencies) ofvibrations exist around us but our ears can ‘hear’ only those as ‘sound’which reach them at audible frequencies. As mentioned earlier, ev-ery kind of vibration produces sound (sonic wave) and there are infi-nite types of sounds that we cannot perceive.... The ultra- and infra-sounds fall under this category of ‘subtle’ or ‘latent’ sound. Thesound produced by vibrations in the frequency range of about 8 X 105to 106 cps is identified as ultrasound. The ultrasound waves are sopowerful and fast that they could penetrate and cut the hard materi-als like diamonds and bones in negligible fraction of a second. Withthe development of advanced technology for the controlled genera-tion and perception of such waves, ultrasound has offered significantapplications right from heavy industries to delicate surgical opera-tions of the internal organs and tissues since the past few decades."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44Eternity... Science of MantrasThe early applications of ultrasound in medicine and surgery hadreceived worldwide publicity. Some reported incidents in this regardinclude the following: A severe backache of a lawyer in Paris wascured in just five minutes. The late American president Mr. Kennedyhad once suffered from backache and muscular stiffness while hewas participating in a tree-plantation programme somewhere inCanada. He was instantly treated by ultrasound therapy used by hispersonal doctor, Dr. Trawell. The physical disabilities of over ninetychildren, who were suffering from Polio or Arthritis, were cured inParis by the same therapy. The otherwise ‘permanent’ mole of apatient in Germany was completely removed in a fortnight by a regu-lar treatment by ultrasound for few seconds every day.The first experiment on ultrasound treatment of wounds was con-ducted on twenty-seven patients, whose body parts were cut duringaccidents...., in the Sallpetrie hospital in Paris. The wounds of abouteighteen of these patients were cured completely while about eighthad recovered partially. Some German doctors also succeed in apply-ing ultrasound therapy to cure some diseases of ears that were incur-able by medicines or surgery. In their initial attempts on a sample ofsixteen patients, the doctors had achieved almost instantaneous suc-cess in the case of six patients and an equal number of patients showedpartial but positive response.Ultrasonics has found significant place in advanced medical technol-ogy today. Although the existence of these waves was discoveredwithin two year since that of the X- rays (in 1895), their first success-ful application was registered by Dr. Karl T. Datzic’s work in 1942.Soon after this, Dr. H. Hubert of the Geology division in a Universityof California had also demonstrated the use of ultrasonic vibrations incleaning delicate old bones that were lying (stored) in brittle state.Similar contemporary works had triggered multifaceted research andtechnological developments and the domain of ultrasonic applicationshad soon expanded to the areas ranging – from cleaning and wash-ing, to the cutting of heavy metal sheets...; from engineering tools todelicate surgery ..., etc.When the subtle and high-speed vibrations of ultrasound are chargedelectrically, their penetrating power is intensified tremendously so that"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45Eternity... Science of Mantrasthey could pass through the atoms of any kind of ultra-dense mate-rial. This rare property has given rise to a unique application ofultrasound, viz. – sonography. It has been found to be more use-ful than the X-ray radiation both in terms of the noninvasivenessand the accuracy and fineness of scanning. Even in the earlier daysof its development in the high-tech countries, the medical applicationsof sonography had helped successful diagnosis of several intra-bodyailments/ abnormalities where X- rays had failed.Apart from the applications in surgery and sonographic recordings,the sophisticated use of these super fast ultrasonic waves in medicalbiotechnology include cell-membrane treatments and RBCupgradation. Some researchers at Los Angeles (USA) and in Ger-many have also successfully experimented for using these wavesalong with intravenous drug injecting and infrared radiation therapies.Development of ultrasound transducers has further advanced the ul-trasonic applications at the cellular and molecular levels. The ultra-sound transducers convert electrical energy into sonic energy andgenerate sound waves at a speed higher than 20,000 per sec. Thesewaves, when collide with an object, produce a ‘reflected’ image ofthe same. This image can then be recorded and processed by otherenergy medium(s) as well. Techniques based on ultrasound transduc-ers have been very useful in tissue culture processing and analysis.Dr. Joseph Holmes’ research at the Colorado University, USA, wasamong the first few successful experiments on such noninvasivetechniques. Ultrasonic transducers are now a common tool in ad-vanced research on deciphering the cellular and molecular mecha-nisms of various diseases ranging from tuberculosis to several typesof cancers.The above examples of modern scientific utilization of the power ofsound give us sufficient reason to find substance in the power ofmantras especially in the context of – mantra therapy for the elimi-nation of a number of disorders, ailments and toxic effects... etc.These also evince the possibilities of hypnotic control of otherperson’s mind by the mantra-based t³ntrika techniques like m³raña,mohan, ucc³tana... etc. The historical scriptures like Mahabharata"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46Eternity...

The vital energythat enables functioning of the body-system and the spiritual powerof the inner sentiments and the unconscious mind were the princi-pal source of their experiments on mantra-s³dhan³s. Amongthe spiritual saints of the modern India, the revered names ofMaharÌi Raman and MaharÌi Aurbindo are often cited in the contextof creative use of the boundless power of Ïabda hidden in one’sthoughts and sentiments.Sri Aurobindo’s mental waves are said to have invited, inspired andcontrolled a large number of great souls who had descended in Indiato initiate and successfully excel India’s non-violent struggle for free-dom.... MaharÌi Raman similarly is described to have had the super-natural power to influence the thoughts and sentiments of others byhis mental and latent spiritual ‘messages’. Many people have ‘wit-nessed’ the demonstrations of his power – he was even able to com-municate, guide and share the sentiments with the animals aroundhim and his Ashram.The force of Ïabda rooted in the thought waves and emotional cur-rents is evolved and works in the subliminal domain of the ManomayaKoïa – the Mind Cell (the mental sheath of the soul). Its power thatgives rise to sonic vibrations has tremendous potential to affect everything, including, the energy spheres on the farthermost planets in thecosmos....

Science of MantrasNature had enabled them quote the Vaidika Mantras in specific pho-netic patterns and also devise specific scripts to represent the latter.They also invented the modes of rhythmic enunciation and chantingof these mantras for generating and regulating specific streams ofthe eternal power of Ïabda. The vaidika hymns (ac³s), thoughappearing like simple prayers with different combinations of syllables,are, in fact, like subtle devices that are scientifically designed to ex-tract and use the power of Ïabda immanent in sound.The universe is described as an unlimited ocean of sonic vibrations ofinfinitely many types of subtle and physical sounds. The latter include– the solar noise, the sounds produced by the gigantic motion of plan-ets and by meteoritic explosions, ‘cosmic noise’ produced by the gi-gantic flow (motion) of the galaxies and the uncountable varieties ofother sounds of smaller intensities. The superb super-impositions ofthese infinite sonic vibrations continuously give rise, and also get ‘ab-sorbed’ into the self-existent eternal sound of Oa®. The spirituals³dhan³ of Ïabda helps realization and intrinsic perception of thisomnipresent sound.When the (ultra) sound, externally produced by the electrically in-duced vibrations in a tiny Brazilian Quartz itself could offer so manyapplications of immense importance in medicine and technology thenwhat would be the potential of the eternal supernatural sound of theevolutionary impulse of the universe? The advanced scientific re-search into higher dimensions of sound should leave no room for doubt-ing the supernormal experiences of the iÌis who had attained (byÏabda Yoga) the ability to reach the cosmic dimension of omnipres-ent sound.Some scientific experiments on investigating the latent power of soundthrow light upon its linkage with the willpower. Authentic reports oninteresting examples in this regard include the following demonstra-tion which took place in Australia only a few years ago. Two re-searchers named Graham and Nile had conducted this demonstrativeexperiment. Thousands of people witnessed that – a loud and consis-tent (i.e. at a constant amplitude) utterance of the word START in-deed resulted in the starting of a 5 -7 tons heavy car; shouting of theword GO triggered this car to move along the road at full speed with-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48Eternity... Science of Mantrasout a driver.... Equally surprising was the observation by the specta-tors that the car also instantaneously obeyed the oral order of “HALT”!The scientific principle in the above experiment was – the conversionof sound into electrical energy. The demonstrator was holding a tiny(of the size of a matchbox) transistor that was transmitting his voice (i.e.,the ‘sound’ of the ordered words) at appropriate frequencies, via electri-cal power to the control unit connected beneath the dash-board of thecar. The electromagnetic effect of the same was utilized by the ‘car-radio’ connected to this unit on the one side and the controller unit(the engine, brakes etc.) of the car on the other.Rigorous scientific analysis of the power and properties of sound hasbecome feasible with the advent of the technology for Spectrogra-phy16 of the recorded (perceived) sound. In a series of experiments,Dr. Lawrence Castro of the AT & T Bell Labs (USA) had found that– the spectrograph of an individual is specific to himself and will notbe identical to that of any one else. If the same sentence was spokenby different persons, the respective spectrographs were also found tobe different. Even if the frequencies and amplitude of the spokensound was the same, the types of line segments in the graphs corre-sponding to different persons’ voices were different. If a sentencewas spoken by a single person under different states of the body (e.g.normal, having high fever, under common cold etc.), the spectrographremained the same. Further experiments on spectrographs showedthat the sound waves are independent of the effects of rainfall, storm,temperature, pressure etc.The sound waves generated by even the subtlest sound are spreadinstantaneously and can traverse thousands of miles along with othervibrations of similar frequency in a matter of a few seconds.... In thisprocess some waves could also be reflected back with the vibrationsof matching frequency moving in other directions.... Thus, each goodor bad word spoken by us carries it influence everywhere around andit would eventually reach back to us with the corresponding magni-fied effects.The science of Mantra is based on the realization of the ‘originalenergy currents’ subliminally indwelling in Ïabda without any ampli-fication or control by external (e.g. by electrical impulses) energies."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49Eternity...

Conver-sion and transmission of sound into light is carried out in this instru-ment by a reverse operation analogously.Experiments conducted with the help of the instruments of the abovetypes have shown that the super-sonic (including ultrasonic and infra-sonic) waves are similar in nature to the light waves. This similarityincreases with a reduction in their wavelengths. The supersonic wavescan be reflected and transmitted in different mediums with greaterease (i.e. with lesser energy).... Moreover, as these waves traversea dense medium at a faster pace than a rare medium, they couldattract the power of different kinds of sources of light by a comple-mentary process.Every mantra in the Vedas has been linked with a devat³ that sym-bolizes an eternal energy field of specific flow of cosmic conscious-ness. Whenever a mantra is enunciated or chanted in a specific rhyth-mic manner, its associated sonic waves expand in a specific patternand after traversing across the layers of energy-particles in the sur-rounding space reach and penetrate the corresponding cosmic nucleiof divine powers.The subtle energy of mind generated through meditation while per-forming a japa of the mantras helps transformation of the soundwaves into electromagnetic waves for necessary cosmic transmis-sion.

The mechani-cal role of mouth and its energy (utilized in the process of chewingand gulping, for instance) in the digestive system is well known. Moreimportant is its role as linked with the vocal cord and hence with thefunctions of speaking and singing.... The power of speech is amongthe most significant gifts bestowed upon the human species. Its im-portance can be very well understood simply by realizing the limita-tions and disabilities of a dumb fellow.At the gross level, the agni cakra of mouth performs the initial phaseof digestive mechanism, at the subtle level, it ‘produces’ voice andhelps pronunciation. At the astral level it generates divine flows ofthe ‘currents’ of Ïabda in the individual consciousness. While thefirst two are well known to most of us, the third and the most signifi-cant role is experienced only by the experts of the japa yoga – thespiritual endeavors associated with japa and meditation of mantras.The inlet of mouth is also regarded a living havan kuñÃa19 withrespect to the divine importance of the sonic energy as a source ofexpression of multiple manifestations of Ïabda. One would be sur-prised to note that the enormous impact of japa yoga is based on thissublime power of his mouth.That words spoken could well become the cause of an affectionaterelationship or of hatred and hosility – illustrates the fact that thewords are not only the carriers of information but they do retain andconvey the sentiments of the speaker. The currents of conscious-ness of the speaker endowed in his speech flow with the sonic vibra-tions produced by the pronunciation of these words. These elementsproduce ‘conscious–effects’ at the destination with which the asso-ciated sound waves collide. While the acoustic effects could be stud-ied by physical means, the ‘conscious-effects’, being latent and sub-liminal in nature, can only be realized and analyzed through spiritualpractices of yoga s³dhan³s."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52Eternity... Science of MantrasExtraction of the essence of the conscious power of the words (sound)is aimed at in the japa yoga. The physical vibrations generated bythe sound of rhythmic enunciation (japa) affect the body of the chanter(s³dhaka) and his surrounding space and the associated consciouselements induce his mind and the inner self and ‘titillate’ the relatedconscious-energy centers in the cosmic domains.The science of mantras is founded on the science of the ‘consciouscurrents’ of the Ïabda inherent in the musical sound generated by aconscious being. The meaning of the mantras has negligible impor-tance as compared to the specific configuration of syllables/phonemesin them. The G³yatri Mantra is regarded as supreme of all theVaidika Mantras. In terms of linguistic meaning, it is a universalprayer of arousal and illumination of righteous intellect in all. Manyother divine prayers written in different languages might also im-ply similar meanings, but it is the unique sonic pattern that gives aunique importance to this mantra.The subtle sonic pattern of this mantra is supposed to generate spe-cific vibrations in the gross as well as the mental and causal bodies ofthe s³dhaka and in his surroundings. These vibrations empoweredby the spiritual force of the s³dhaka’s purified inner self conjugatewith the extrasensory impulse of the supreme consciousness.... Thesingle lettered (bºja) mantras like Hº®, Ïrº®, Klº®, Ai, H¿®, Ya®,FaÚ etc. are of basic importance in the science of mantras becauseof the special conscious as well as ‘mechanical’ (t³ntrika) effects oftheir sounds.The cyclic enunciation (or chanting) under different rhythms, pitchesand intensities is practiced in the japa of a mantra to make differentuses of its (mantra’s) sonic vibrations. In M³nasika Japa the man-tra is uttered silently (mentally); the level of ‘perceivable’ sound in-creases gradually (e.g. from the silent movements of the lips and thetongue to murmuring and humming) in the up³nÌu and v³cika japas.As described in the previous sections, the Vaidika Mantras also havespecific swaras (classical musical accents) associated with them thatoffer varieties in their japa and hence in their effects.....

Science of MantrasThe consistent japa of the mantras has dual effects: externally, itgenerates vibrations in the surrounding space and internally, it stimu-lates the extrasensory energy centers (cakras) and subtle endocrineglands inside the body. The impact of these effects amplifies signifi-cantly with continuous repetition of such rhythmic enunciation at aconstant pace. Laboratory experiments have shown the physicalstrength of rhythmic sound that can empower a small cork to push aheavy iron rod..... A large number of examples of the Doppler effectgiven in the earlier sections should suffice to evince the physical po-tential of the superimposed sound waves.The internal creative effects of japa can be illustrated by simpleanalogy with the functioning of a typewriter. When a key of a type-writer is pressed, its impact results in the printing of the correspond-ing letter or symbol on the paper. Similarly, the vibrations producedby silent or vocal enunciation of a syllable or combinations of thesyllables of a mantra make specific impressions on the subtle energycenters and nerve-bundles and stimulate them. Regular repeated prac-tice of the same japa under adept disciplines is indeed the root of theenormous potential gained during different spiritual experiments ofMantra-Vijó³na.That friction gives rise to the thermal and electrical (static) energies– is well known to every student of physics. The internal vibrationsproduced by the sonic waves of japa create similar effects and acti-vate the otherwise unused latent glands and extrasensory energy cen-ters inside the body of the s³dhaka.The advanced scientific applications ranging –– from remote controlof the space-crafts by electromagnetic waves; delicate surgeries toheavy metal cutting by the Lasers.... etc clearly illustrate that it is notthe equipment or the device but it is the ‘power’ of the (energy)waves that induces such wonderful effects. The supernatural ef-fects of the suprasonic waves generated by the japa of mantras aremore remarkable and are still beyond the reach of the advanced in-struments (generators and the sensory devices) developed so far.In terms of the modern (material based) science or acoustics, soundis generated by vibrations produced in any physical medium.

They include the sublime realms ofconsciousness and therefore form a subject of investigations by thespiritual scientists.The japa yoga aims at using the physical as well as the spiritualpower of Ïabda with the help of the specific sonic patterns of themantras. The subtle energy waves generated by the japa of a man-tra reach at the specific cosmic center (linked with the devat³ of themantra) and attract the supernatural currents of cosmic conscious-ness in proportionate amounts.The whole universe is like an ocean of the electromagnetic and con-scious energy waves. The flow of thoughts and sentiments takesplace via the latter kind of omnipresent waves. The sublime energywaves produced along with the ‘physical’ sound waves by the japaare spread in the cosmos and they reach back (with an amplifiedimpact) to the s³dhaka after being superimposed and further ‘elec-trified’ by the subtle waves of similar nature existing along their cos-mic path....The divine or the evil thoughts generated by an individual mind influ-ence the fields of thoughts in the surrounding by attracting the thoughtwaves of compatible quality and repulsing those of the opposite qual-ity.

These inducing effects, though subliminal in nature, in-deed play an important role in inspiring and shaping one’s characterand hence in building one’s destiny too.The subtle waves generated by the mantra-japa are often more pow-erful and faster than the thought waves of the s³dhaka. If generatedrepeatedly, in a consistent cyclic manner, these suprasonic waveshelp create serene and divine ambience within and around the s³dhakawith strong field of attraction to influence the other waves of thoughtsand sentiments that might collide with them.It is well known that the compounded magnetic effects of similaratoms (particles) gives rise to their dense collection. This clusteringeventually results in the formation a mine, which gets richer by theaugmentation in its power of attraction by successive increase in itsrepository of similar atoms (particles).

Analo-gously, the force of the conscious energy in the waves generated bythe japa intensifies along with the increase in the faith, sincerity,strength and piety of thoughts and sentiments of the s³dhaka(s).The lack of knowledge about the spiritual dimensions of Ïabda andthe non-applicability of the existing scientific instruments in sensingor measuring the domains of the subtle sonic waves make it practi-cally impossible to conduct usual laboratory-experiments in the sci-ence of mantras. This is why the subject matter of Mantra-Vijó³nais often attributed to philosophy, mythology or blind faith or its studylargely remains confined to controversial or inconclusive ‘intellec-tual’ arguments alone. The misdeeds and perversion of the medievalera in the name of ‘spirituality’ have been most detrimental, as thesehave led to destroying and shrouding the real knowledge and widen-ing the gap between the ‘materialistic’ and ‘spiritual’ sciences. Thishas severely hindered the possibility of scientific research into thisbranch of knowledge with an open mind."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56Eternity... Science of MantrasSeveral examples demonstrating the power of mantras are howeverreported – including popularly witnessed incidents, in the modern cen-tury. For instance, it was reported a couple of decades ago, that thewomen magicians called Vamohas had successfully stopped and pre-vented the heavy rainfall for the desired number of days on a playground during a Commonwealth sports festival in Quallalampur (Ma-laysia) and also on a shooting site of an American film company.The advanced science of today has realized the power of the supersonic waves and has also conceded the limitations of the materialbased research with respect to a complete decipheration of the im-mense potential of the functioning of the human-brain and mind. Thisis the right time that the subtler forms of sound existing in Ïabda beinvestigated scientifically. The Mantra Vijnó³na should be studied inthe light of the fact that –– this ancient science was developed by theriÌis who began their research by focussing on the fields of con-sciousness rather than matter (or perceivable entities). The intrinsicresearch conducted by these scientists of yore had helped them real-ize the eternal origin and the ultimate expansion of sound – the ÏabdaBrah®, in conjunction with the cosmic consciousness.The mantras devised by the iÌis were not only perfect with respectto the compilation of specific sonic patterns, these creations also con-tained the formulae for awakening the specific nuclei of the supremeconsciousness subliminally existing in the universe. Having realizedall the dimensions of the eternal sound, the iÌis had referred it asÏabda-Brah®, the omnipresent and omnipotent thy sound.The script designed by the iÌis to assign syllables suitable for thecompilation of the mantras was also perfect in terms of the corre-spondence of the shapes of the syllables with the associated ‘geom-etry’ (spectrograph) of the phonetic pattern (of the syllables) and thesonic waveforms. This script was also unique in terms of the com-pact representation of the latent meanings and the multiple modes ofjapa and chanting. The in-depth analysis of the available forms ofthe ancient scripts used in the Vedas and study of its scope in ad-vanced applications (e.g. for knowledge- representation in the intelli-gent computers) – has become an active area of research in themodern times. We shall look into various aspects of the creation andeffects of mantras in the following sections."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57Eternity... Science of MantrasStructure and Implications of MantrasSwami Ramatirtha had once stated that – ‘One may become a Godbut one can never see or show thee...’. The same is true of the subtleelements, they can be experienced or felt-in but can’t be seen or shownin a laboratory. Flow of radio waves through the ether is well knownthough no instrument has been able to measure or demonstrate the ‘ap-pearance’ or ‘existence’ of ether. We do feel the effects of chill,heat, happiness, sorrow... etc. in our day-to-day life but we can neversee or show these effects in visible or otherwise perceivable forms.Recitation of the mantras is only a means for arousing the omnipres-ent subtle power of Ïabda. When we awake somebody by pushinghim by our hand, the hand simply plays the role of a tool, it is not a partof the process of awakening. Similarly, the specific configuration ofsyllables and the sound (including the sublime sound) produced by thejapa of a mantra is only a means for activating specific field of thecosmic energy of Ïabda. Which mantra is suitable for awakeningwhat kind of subliminal energy center – is described in the viniyoga(structural classification) of that mantra. All of the Vaidika and theT³ntrika Mantras have distinct viniyogas. The ancient scripturesof Âgama and Nigama describe the viniyoga part along with thedetails on the methods (and s³dhan³s) of the japa of the mantras.Before reciting a mantra one must read and understand its viniyoga.The viniyoga of each mantra has five components – (i) RiÌi, (ii)Chanda, (iii) Devat³, (iv) Bºja and (v) Tatva. The first componentcontains the names of the iÌi(s) or the spiritual saints who had dis-covered, compiled and/or completely mastered that particular man-tra and who therefore are regarded authorities on all the knowledgeassociated with the spiritual practice of that mantra. Such spiritualsaints are the ideal gur¿s (guides) for the disciples who endeavor as³dhan³ of that mantra. Recalling this first component of the –viniyoga of a mantra also implies that revered devotion for those iÌis and adept guidance of a noble gur¿ is essential for practising (thejapa of) that mantra.The chanda indicates the rhythmic composition for the enunciationor chanting of the mantra. As described earlier, each mantra can be"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58Eternity... Science of Mantraspractised with different combinations of swaras (musical accents)and gati (amplitudes). M³nasika, V³cika, Up³nïu, Ud³tta-An¿d³tta,Swarita...., etc are some of the many modes of japa that are alsodescribed in the chanda for a mantra. The specific pattern of sonicwaveforms generated by the mantra–japa depends upon the syl-lables of the mantra and the type of chanda used. The assignmentof appropriate chanda for the spiritual s³dhan³ processes of prac-tising a mantra is called – yati. The selection of a yati and hence ofa chanda for a given mantra is decided with respect to the purposeof the s³dhan³, the configuration of the mantra-syllables and themental and spiritual level of the s³dhaka.The third component, the devat³ represents the specific cosmic field(– of the subliminal energy of Ïabda) in the limitless expression ofthe supreme thy consciousness – that is aimed to be reached (real-ized) by the japa-s³dhan³ of the associated mantra. We all knowthat out of the different programmes being broadcast via the radio waves,a radio set can catch (receive) only the ones whose frequencies it istuned for. Similarly, from the different streams of the consciouspower of Ïabda present in the universe, a mantra can be used to linkthe individual consciousness with the devat³ of that mantra.As the practice of the mantra involves devoted meditation upon thedevat³ along with the specified (according to the chanda) rhythmicenunciation or chanting, the iÌis had assigned visible forms to differ-ent devat³s – representing different manifestations and subliminalexpressions of the One, Eternal, Thy Consciousness.... Some of theiÌis also recommended worshiping the idols – of these forms of thedevat³s – in sacred atmosphere before commencing the japa of themantras.Worshiping an idol of God often facilitates proper meditation and cre-ation of the internal emotions to strike the intrinsic core of absolutefaith that is necessary for confluence of the individual consciousnesswith the cosmic flow of divinity. This type of rituals (called s³k³raup³san³) do help conditioning the minds of the disciples who find itdifficult to meditate upon the subliminal forms of Ïabda in the ï¿nya– the absolute void, the ultimate, the ‘non-existent’ but eternal realmsof thy conception."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59Eternity... Science of MantrasThe bºja represents the origin of the mantra. It may be understoodas a group of those syllables that contain, in compact coded form, thegist (tatva) of the mantra and thereby imply the latent existence ofthe specific power of Ïabda in that mantra. The japa of the bºjagenerates the ‘energy’ essential for initiating the activation of the‘power’ of the associated mantra.The understanding and expertise of the science of mantras had illu-minated the minds of the iÌis with supernormal sagacity. They couldtherefore grasp the knowledge of the limitless expansion of the uni-verse and completely ‘visualize’ the structure and function of thetiniest part of the over 72000 nerves and glands mysteriously foldedinside the human body and could also accomplish remarkable spiritualrealizations. They also presented different streams of their intrinsicknowledge in the ancient Indian scriptures via prose consisting of thehymns of mantras.The scientific significance of the sound produced by specific syllableshas attracted many researchers to study the special features of thesonic waveforms generated by the recitation of the mantras. Theultrasonometer developed by Dr. Fristlov is used for triggering dif-ferent chemical reactions via the effect of ultrasound. The stirrerused in this device can be made to stir (by the obvious effect ofultrasound!) so fast that in no time it can make the steady water –contained around it – churn violently like that during boiling at maxi-mum pace. As far as the sonic effects are concerned, the subtlepower of a mantra, if focused, can be more ‘explosive’ than thenuclear power.The yogis often use the vital power of the air-element (v³yu-tatva)and gain supernatural physical powers. A m³ntrika20 works at thehighest level (³k³ïa21) – in the hierarchy of the five basic elementsand he can therefore be more powerful than other yogis.Apart from the physical power of Ïabda, the mantras are also en-dowed with the ‘magnetic’ power of the conscious energy of Ïabda.The emotional linkage – through absolute intrinsic faith (ïraddh³) –with the devat³ of the mantra attracts the subliminal energy of Ïabda."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60Eternity... Science of MantrasThe devotion and prayers of the devat³ of the mantra are performedto initiate this linkage. The rhythmic enunciation or chanting of man-tras gives rise to two types of subtle fields of influence – one, the‘sphere’ of sonic effects, and the other, of emotional (conscious) ef-fects. The expansion and the power of attraction of these fieldsintensify with continuous (cyclic) japa of the mantras in specificrhythm in a consistent manner. So powerful their force of attractioncould be that, any kind of material or conscious form entering intotheir peripheries could be transformed according to the influence ofthe mantra. The use of mantras for enlightening the mental andsentimental domains of all the human beings may therefore be re-garded as a scientific possibility, a spiritual endeavor, rather than amyth or a daydreaming.***"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61Eternity... Science of MantrasMantra Yoga: Effects on Gross BodyA human being is defined to be an ensemble of the gross (physical)body, subtle (mental and energy) body and the astral body (the innerself or the domain of the soul). The existence of three perennial ex-pressions of thy powers of the trinity Gods – Brahma, Vishnu andShiva, is said to be vital for the manifestation of Nature and life. Theexistence of the three bodies is similarly an integral part of the exist-ence of any living being in this world. The three bodies, like thetriveñº – confluence of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna andSaraswati, are separate as well as one – being the interwoven seg-ments of a single individual self.The refinement and development of any one of these bodies wouldbe incomplete without the other two. Therefore, when we talk aboutthe role of Ïabda or Mantra Vijó³na in human-life, we must ana-lyze the respective effects on each of the three forms (bodies) of ahuman being.As discussed earlier, our world is physically constituted by three ba-sic energies viz. Sound, Light and Heat. According to the electro-magnetic wave theory, the ever-expanding universe is described as alimitless ocean of energy waves. Grasping and utilization of some ofthese has given rise to the inventions and discoveries like radio, tele-phone, television, X-rays, radio-rays, laser, gamma-rays, ...., etc. Enor-mous combinations of superimposition of compatible waves are sup-posed to give rise to the energy particles, various subtle particle-statesand ultimately to the atomic and molecular forms of matter. The rootcause of the existence of different physical forms/states of any kindof material – howsoever subtle or gigantic it might be – is the ‘colli-sion or superimposition’ of some of these omnipresent, ever vibrating,energy waves.The eternal forms of sound and vibrations are synonymous with re-spect to their physical existence. Noting this, a natural conclusion ofthe above theory would be that –– Ïabda and N³da are the originsand the ultimate controllers of everything that exists (in a gross orsubtle form) or happens (including the manifestation of life and death)in this universe. Our gross, subtle and astral bodies are thus naturallyaffected by ‘sound’."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62Eternity...

Several examples of the negative physical ef-fects of the impact of sound on the gross body have been describedearlier in the context of the Doppler effect and noise pollution....

The latter two types ofeffects often remain unrecognized because of the random and in-stantaneous vibrations in our conscious and unconscious mind andirregularities in our physical activities vis-à-vis the large number ofstochastic interactions in the ever-dynamic modes of our sublime in-teraction with the above energies in Nature.

There-fore, the coding of the sonic patterns in these mantras is perfect withrespect to the impact of Ïabda. Many a times, the realization of thesyllables for subtle sounds (N³da) in the etheric ocean had occurred tothe iÌis through an afflatus or intuition in their intrinsic inspirations orthe mantras were just ‘heard’ by them in the state of trance.

It deals withthe development of ‘mechanisms’ for direct, fast and high-intensity‘physical’ impact of the power of Ïabda on specific targets.

The S³ma Veda focuses upondifferent methods of composing the rhythms for the vedic mantrasthat play important role in sound therapy. The modes of pronunciationof mantra-syllables and the methods of chanting of the mantras inmusical orders – for therapeutic applications – fall into the categoryof Ïabdika BhaiÌaja.There are four types of BhaiÌajas described in the BhaiÌaja Tantra,a Treatise on the ancient Indian medicine and pharmacology. Theseare categorized as the pawanaukaÌa, jalaukaÌa, vanaukaÌa andï³bdika.

The soothing ef-fects of sonorous music in giving instant relief from mental ten-sion and in curing some psychological disorders are well known.More importantly, the t³la (rhythm) and swara (accent or basic note)of the musical patterns offer a wide spectrum of compositions whichcould be designed for curing or controlling specific hormonal disor-ders and associated physiological and mental aberrations.The Indian classical music is enriched with a variety of such compo-sitions (r³gas) that could be made more effective if played alongwith the strong company of the classical instruments like – sit³ra,vºñ³, tabal³, madanga®, or t³napur³. Six ancient r³gas (tunes/compositions) of the Indian classical music have been signified in theGandharva Veda; namely, the – Ïrº R³ga, Bhairava R³ga, HindolaR³ga, Malkaunsa R³ga, Vih³ra R³ga and the Megha R³ga. Aboutfive to six varieties or subclasses of these r³gas are also consideredto be of fundamental importance. The ancient musicians have alsodevised several other compositions by specific combinations of theser³gas.

It is quite likelythat the audio disks and cassettes of the ‘Vaidik Hymns in differentr³gas’ would become integral parts of the health support systems inthe sanatoriums and intensive care units of future.How the musical sound would affect a disorderly (diseased) state isexplained in detail in the ancient scriptures. The basic principles ofÂyurveda have emerged from the concept of defining/ classifying ahuman body’s system in terms of three basic natural properties –v³ta, pitta and kafa. Corresponding to the characteristic features ofthese three tendencies, there is a mention in the Gandharva Vedaabout their respective musical properties viz., samyak t³rat³ of v³ta,samyak tºvrat³ of pitta and samyak m³dhurya of kafa.As v³ta, pitta and kafa have a direct bearing upon the intra-bodyfunctions that are based on the use of air (e.g. O2 in oxidation reac-tions), heat (e.g. in various thermodynamic regulations) and water(e.g. the aqueous medium for bio-molecular binding) respectively, sohave their musical analogues – the t³rat³s. The ancient Indian schoolsof medical sciences had recommended the study of the treatise onmusic and sound – like the Gandharva Veda, as an integral part ofthe study of Âyurveda.

Science of MantrasThe Phonetics of Collective Chanting Described in the VedasPhonetics and sonic principles have been given maximum importancein the compilation of the mantras that encode the supreme knowl-edge compiled in the four Vedas. The S³ma Veda, in particular,emphasizes the most on the rhythmic patterns of the chanting of thevedic mantras.Specific symbols are used in the Vedas to represent different accentsand amplitudes. The savants note that because of a highly compactsymbolic representation, each letter of the vedic-mantras can haveas many as eighteen different forms of phonemes associated with itspronunciation. A complete decipheration of this self- sufficient pho-netic code has not been possible by the scholars of later times. Somesymbols have been decoded to identify the swaras (accents) with thehelp of the main principles cited in Mah³muni P³tanjali’sMah³bh³Ìya. For instance, the vertical and horizontal lines around asyllable of the Veda-script are found to indicate the levels of high(ud³tta), medium (anud³tta) or low (swarit) accents.The scholars of the vedic literature have largely interpreted that thesymbolic representation serves the main purpose to help decide achanting pattern for collective singing of mantras during a yajóa, or,to guide designing specific modes of japa for creating specific acousticeffects to meet the desired purposes. It is also found that a singleword would have multiple meaning and impact because of the spe-cific context of these symbols in the same or different mantras.The treatise on the Sanskrit grammar and the vedic literature avail-able to the scholars of our times are too difficult and vast in terms of– (i) identifying the correct and the most logical meaning of a word(in a vedic mantra) from amongst the possible multiple meanings; or(ii) generalizing the principles for such interpretations.

Most often his interpretations seem tohave been blindly copied from the Swar Prakriy³ (rules for identifi-cation of accents or phonetic patterns) defined by Bhatt-Bh³skara inTaittirºya Sa®hit³. His independent interpretations are almost 50%erroneous; about 4 to 5 mistake per hymn is common in his work....For instance, a word ‘doÌ³ vasta¡’ in a hymn of the first manÃal(part) of the Rig-Veda has been, because of the erring knowledgeabout the vedic accents (symbols), interpreted by S³yañ³c³rya as‘morning and evening’ instead of ‘fire’.... This mistake appears to havebeen adopted from the meaning of this word cited by Bhatt Bh³skar in‘Taittirºya Sa®hit³’ – 1|5|6|2. Similar meaning of this word is mis-taken by Shriniwas Jha in his compilation of ‘Swar Siddh³®taCandrik³’ – 9|2|27. Venkat Madhav’s Laghu Bh³Ìya, as edited byDr. Lakshman Swaroopa also contains the same mistake”.Shri Venkat Madhav is regarded to be one among the most eru-dite scholars of the vedic swaras. His consistency and in-depthanalysis of the symbolic arrangements clearly indicates his excel-lence in his Brhada Bh³Ìya of the Rig-Veda.... Still if the compila-tion or extension of his Laghu Bh³Ìya contains misinterpretations(like the one cited above) of the vedic swaras then one might won-der whether the available versions of his Laghu Bh³Ìya is defiledfrom its original form...?The book also points out the controversies in the works of some mod-ern scholars. For instance, it mentions – “The patterns for decodingof the vedic swaras as introduced by Shri Pt. PadmanarayanaAcharya, Shri Pt. Ghareshwar Shastri, Shri Pt. Satawalekarji andShri Pt.

Eminent foreignscholars like Mr. Maxmular, also, despite dedicating over twenty yearsof diligent search for maximum literature (commentaries) on Vedas,had to largely rely upon Acharya S³yaña’s work because of the non-availability of the earlier treatises in the original or complete form.The scholars of modern age have used Maxmular as the principalreference for their translations and commentaries of the vaidikamantras. However, in view of the serious criticism of AcharyaS³yaña’s understanding of the vaidika swaras as cited in the abovementioned book, one might be confused about the authenticity of anyof the literature on the Vedas that is available (in published or writtenform) today.Apart from the arbitrary variations in the styles of various schools ofthoughts, the printing mistakes add to the erroneous interpretations.Some earlier (namely, 1st to 5th) editions of the Veda-compilations –published by a printer in Ajmer, under the auspices of the Arya Samaj– are cited in the above mentioned book as examples in this regardIt would therefore not be an exaggeration to infer that – “Access tothe most original BhaÌya of the Ved³s and a foolproof analysis of thephonetic- symbols used in the vaidika script will not be possible inthe present era, unless the spiritual yogis of today invoke deeperacumen like the iÌis and endeavor realizing the perfect meaningsand swaras through the inner intellect”.***"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72Eternity... Science of MantrasDifficulties in Rhythmic Enunciation of Vaidika HymnsAs stated earlier, the original forms of the vaidika phonemes and theassociated accents (swaras) for the chanting of any syllable, wereclassified into eighteen different types. The ancient experts – the iÌis were able to pronounce each of these swaras distinctly for thepurpose of collective chanting of Veda-Mantras during differentyajóas. Owing to the adoption of artificial life style and lack of spiri-tually high value system, the natural sublime capabilities in the vocalcord got suppressed and our ancestors, few thousands years ago,began to use only seven out of these eighteen swaras. The seventypes were identified as – ud³tta, ud³ttara, anud³tta, anud³ttara,swarita, swaritod³tta and ïruti.Over the years, this number was further reduced to three. Namely,the ud³tta (high), anud³tta (medium) and the swarita (low) accentsseemed to have been in existence since the time of Mah³bh³rata.These three swaras are practised by the experts and only one chant-ing pattern (in single swara) is now recommended for the collectiverecitation of mantras by the masses. The correct identification andpronunciation of even the three swaras – depicted by different sym-bols in the vaidika script – is so difficult that hardly 5 to 10 authenticexperts of Rig-Veda are believed today to possess the true potentialof vocally distinguishing them during the recitation of the vaidikamantras today.The controversies in the current system of coding the vedic swarasfurther complicate the problem. For example, in some of the Rig-Veda Sa®hit³s, published in the modern times, vertical lines above asyllable are used to indicate the swarita swara; whereas in aMaitraiyañi Sa®hit³, such a symbol is supposed to code for a ud³ttaswara..... Many Sa®hit³s use horizontal lines below a letter to code forthe anud³tta swaras but the available versions of Ïatpath Br³hmañause these lines as symbols for the ud³tta swaras.The book entitled “Vedic Swara Mºm³®s³” discusses the abovedifficulties and controversies in detail.

Science of Mantrasand inconsistent to a beginner’. A consistent symbolic representationfor the Vedic Swaras should be based on the in-depth study and sa-gacious analysis of the descriptions and implications cited in the avail-able mantras of the S³ma Veda.Lord Krishna in the holy Gºt³ honors the importance of the S³maVeda where he reveals that – ‘Ved³n³® S³ma Vedosmi’ (amongthe four Vedas, I am the S³ma Veda). It may be recalled here thatVedas are not just some scriptures, volumes or treatises, rather, theyrepresent the divine voice and thy knowledge that was intrinsicallyrealized by the iÌis of the spiritual era. In this context, a logicalinterpretation of the above quote would be that – ‘S³ma Veda isthat stream of the absolute science, the realization of which canbe equivalent to experiencing thy presence in music and in conscious-ness....’. This also implies the importance of sentiments and intrinsicfeelings rather than linguistic details in grasping any aspect of theVedas.Wisdom or intellect alone can only help critical analysis and rationalinterpretations of the mantras, as superb ‘linguistic formulae’, con-taining supernatural knowledge and unique power of sound. The truerealization of the divine knowledge of the Vedas is possible only by aperfect combination of pure intellect and ïraddh³24. It is said that –‘Bh³vohi K³rañama’; meaning – ‘God lives in the serene senti-ments and therefore could be experienced only through the sacredfeelings of the inner self...’. The difference between ‘emotional ex-citements’ or ‘sentiments born of selfish attachments’ and the ‘truesentiments emanated from the deeper cores of the inner self’ shouldbe well understood before accepting these implications.The saintly scholar Goswami Tulasid³sa begins his writing of theHoly R³m³yañ³ with the following prayer of Goddess Parvati asthe inspiration of Ïraddh³ and Lord Shiva as the source ofViïv³sa25.

This way as well, S³ma Veda has a direct link-age with Ïraddh³ and Viïv³sa. We all must have experienced sometime or the other in our life that – “what musical effects easily ‘con-vey’ to us via emotional impact that might never be expressible bywritten or oral words...”. The reach of sentiments and emotions ismuch wider and deeper than the domains of knowledge expressibleby human intellect. The vaidika iÌis, despite having representedtheir intrinsic experiences in the form of vedic mantras, had finallydeclared the Vedas, as – “neti-neti...”, i.e., “beyond the power ofexpression..., inexplicable....”.There are three basic forms of vocal expressions – verse, prose andsinging. Of which, the last two appear to be more effective means ofconveying the sentiments in any language as they lend an emotionalsense to the expressions in any language. Prayers offered to theAlmighty are always presented in a form of verse or devotional songs,because thy presence cannot even be felt without the depth of se-rene emotions....The esoteric knowledge embodied in the Vedas, being an outcome ofthe divine inspirations, was naturally presented by the iÌis as hymnsof mantras that could also be sung in enormous rhythmic patterns,making the corresponding sonic impacts penetrate through the inneremotional cores. The detailed knowledge of the rhythms of the di-vine music (of N³da Brah®) and formulation of the chanting pat-terns for the vaidika mantras is encoded in the S³ma Veda.***"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75Eternity... Science of MantrasS³ma G³na: Chanting of Vaidika MantrasThe unlimited expansion of the Universe and the ever-evolving Na-ture are described in the Indian scriptures as the expressions of thywill. The omnipresent reflections of thee could be felt only throughthe deeper depths of the inner self. We, like the other beings areexpressions of the infinite impulse of eternal consciousness but rec-ognize our existence as individual self in a closed domain of our ownintrinsic, inherent and self-created sentiments.The energy waves of a magnetic or electrical force always completetheir ‘circuits’ in the respective energy-fields. The same is true ofthe subliminal currents of emotions and sentiments. The nature andthe strength of what we receive from the people around – as theirreactions, support or emotional intimacy towards us, or from the om-nipresent realms of the Supreme Consciousness – in the form of af-flatus, inspirations or intrinsic urge..., depends upon what we trans-mit in the subtle domains of sentiments. The great iÌis had under-stood this sublime science of emotions through depths and had alsoattained the spiritual power to induce refinement of the subtle worldof consciousness and sentiments. Their collective endeavors are saidto have educed pious sentiments in all the beings and thus enabled thedescent of a divine era in the Vedic Age.Some distinguished psychologists of the modern times have focussedtheir research on the latent effects of emotions. The series of experi-ments conducted by Dr. Laurence D. Wallace are notable in thiscontext. Different samples of people suffering from depression, ten-sion or anxiety were selected in some of these experiments. Thesubjects were trained to feel that they are living in an emotionallyenergized field of peace and happiness, which is penetrating theirminds to induce similar effects....

These special experimentswere organized in different parts of the state. During each experi-ment, all the members of the group collectively endeavored to focustheir thoughts upon the soothing feeling that their serene sentimentsof love and peace are spreading in the surroundings and purifying theambience. Surprisingly, the systematic and statistically justified sur-veys conducted in the corresponding localities showed that such ex-periments did result in influencing the surrounding areas in terms ofreduction in the rates of crimes and suicides.The above kinds of experiments may appear to be crude in terms ofthrough scientific standards and may stand as naive and negligiblevis-à-vis the spiritual experiments conducted by the iÌis. Neverthe-less, they mark a good beginning and generate the hope that the useof the natural power of emotions would be studied more rigorouslyand applied for the betterment of life in the years to come. Thepositive role of music would be inevitable in this regard because ofthe natural intimacy of music and emotions.The three streams of expression of the esoteric knowledge encodedin the Vedas are termed as Veda Trayº. The contents are dividedinto four Vedas that are classified according to the type of mantras.Broadly speaking, the Riga Veda consists of the mantras of the hid-den knowledge and prayers of –– the eternal powers of thee and thegenesis and expansion of divine virtues. The Yajura Veda consists ofthe mantras of the philosophy, science and the methods of perform-ing Yajóas. The S³ma Veda is a collection of the mantras containingthe secrets of swaras, music and the chanting patterns for all thevaidika hymns. The Atharva Veda presents the mantras of the ulti-mate spiritual knowledge of the Supreme – the Brah® Jó³na.

Science of Mantrasthe stream of knowledge pertaining to the rhythmic enunciation andchanting of the specific collections of mantras in the S³ma Veda isof predominant significance for the human society, as it directly dealswith the science of emotions, which hold the essence of life.The ancient Grammarian and founder of the science and philosophyof yoga, MahrÌi P³t³njali mentions of thousand branches of theschools on S³ma Veda, as he refers to ‘Sahastra Vartm³ S³maVeda¡’; several scholars of the later ages also affirm thia. The namesof all the thousand branches are not available in any of the Pur³ñasor other shastrika scriptures available today, and, some critics eveninterpret the word ‘Vartm³’ above to simply indicate different musi-cal patterns of S³ma G³yan (collective chanting). Still, while consid-ering the potential of numerous creations – in terms of the musicalaspects of Ïabda and N³da – in S³ma, the existence of over thou-sand varieties of the S³ma Sa®hit³ appears to be quite logical.It is unfortunate that most of the ancient branches of S³ma Veda areno longer seen. As per the available versions of Prapamca Hadaya,Divy³vad³na, Carañvy¿ha and Jaimini Gahya S¿tra....., etc, onlythirteen schools of S³ma Veda seem to have been active in thepresent era. The names of the corresponding ³c³ryas are remem-bered at the time of performing the ritual of S³matarpaña. Theschools of only three of these thirteen ³c³ryas have been found to behaving disciples in the recent past. Brief introduction of these threebranches is given below.It is interesting to note that – although the names, Pr³cya (meaning,eastern) and Udºcya (meaning, northern), of the most ancient branchescorrespond to the geographical locations of the places of their origin,no school on S³ma Veda is now in existence in the eastern or north-ern parts of India. Whereas, some scholarly activities on the avail-able schools on S³ma Veda are still alive in the Western and South-ern states. Noted among these are – the Kauthuma School,R³ñ³yanºya School and Jaiminºya School.Study of the ancient scriptures like the Pur³ñas and the Br³hmañasshow that the original number of the mantras and the s³ma g³nas inthe S³ma Veda was very much larger than those available in the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78Eternity... Science of MantrasSa®hit³s of the schools of the modern era.

The number of original s³mas (rhyth-mic hymns) is mentioned to be around 8000 and those of the S³maG³nas as 14820. As, most of the authentic scriptures cite the samenumbers, they appear to be true indicators of the vast expansion ofthe S³ma Veda.Schemes of S³ma G³na:As described earlier, the mantras in the S³ma Yoni were used by theisis to design the mantras for musical japa and collective chanting.There are four major categories of the singing pattern here viz., (i)gr³ma g³na, also known as prakati g³na or veya g³na, (ii)³rañyaka g³na, (iii)¿ha g³na and the (iv) ¿hya g³na or rahasyag³na. The mantras in the first five chapters of P¿rv³rcika arechanted under the different styles of veya g³na. The ³rañyaka g³nais applicable for the mantras cited in the Arañya Parva and the ¿haand ¿hya g³na are used for the specific mantras in the Uttar³rcikaas indicated in the corresponding branch (or version) of the Sa®hit³.The distribution of mantras specified by the two main schools underdifferent categories of g³na these days is as follows:The origin of the Indian classical music is based on these S³ma G³nas.The significance of the effects of this music and the fact that it isderived from the subtle scientific principles is well recognized today.It is indeed unfortunate that such a great development of yore was somuch neglected over the centuries that the analysis of its founderprinciples now appears to be ‘impossible’ or ‘non-comprehensive’and ‘beyond reach’. The near total absence of experts, especiallythose with an in-depth knowledge about the swaras, of S³ma G³nahas worsened the hopes of research in this area. Nevertheless, if adedicated classical singer, having perfection of voice to the tune ofM¿rchan³, Âroha and Avaroha, practises a S³ma G³na with dueconcentration and devotion, he would feel the divine inspiration andemotional enlightenment even if the exact meanings of the involvedmantras are not known to him."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79Eternity... Science of MantrasAccording to the classical system of N³rada there are followingclasses of swaras of S³ma: seven basic swaras, three Gr³mas,twenty-one M¿rchan³s and forty-nine T³nas.

Thisvariation is performed according to the indicated phonetic operations.There are six types of such operations of transformation often ap-plied to the mantras in the S³ma Yoni; these are as illustrated below:1. Vik³ra: This would ‘deform’ a linguistically correct word or asegment of words for appropriate pronunciation (suitable to a speci-fied chanting pattern for that mantra....).

Suchas – the Sanskrit word ‘vºtaye’ will become ‘voyitoy³ voyitoy³yi’ for chanting under this operation.3. VikarÌaña: Prolonged accent of one or more swaras; e.g.,‘yey³yi’ will be pronounced (or sung) as – ‘Ye Y³ ³ ³ Yi’.

For example, in the chanting of ‘Gañ³no Havyad³ Taye’one might apply a pause at the pronunciation of ‘Ha’ if the vir³maoperation is symbolized against this letter.6. Stobha: Insert specific sounds, like that of “o”, “Hov³”, “Âuv³”,...., etc against certain markers in s³ma -patterns.Stepwise Division of S³ma G³na:The exact methods of S³ma G³na are too difficult to be describedhere. Dedicated long term study and practice is required for graspingeven a bit of it. However, for the purpose of general information, wehave mentioned a few main points of the relevant subject matter.Continuing along these lines, we find that any scheme of S³ma G³nacan be divided into five successive parts as indicated below:1. Prast³va: This is the first part of the hymn (ic³) of a mantra thatbegins with a Sanskrit syllable “Ha” and is chanted by a Ritvija26who is of the rank of a Prastot³.2. Udgºtha: This portion (of a mantra’s-ic³) is sung by the Pradh³na(main) Ritvija. Its chanting begins with an “Oa®”.3. Pratih³ra: This is like a portion, which links the next parts (steps)of the ic³ with the previous ones. Specific Ritvija called Pratihart³,sings it. Sometimes, this part of the mantra is broken into two beforechanting.4. Upadrava: This step is sung by the Udg³t³.5.

The importance of Ïabda orof its manifestation in sound – is recognized in one form or the otherby almost all known schools of religion in this world.Even the sound produced by the matter has its effects of varied or-ders and types. That thunder bolt affects the bio-rhythms in theanimals as well as the human beings – is a well accepted claim ofhomeopathy. The psychologists would agree that the soft sound ofthe flow of a river does influence the poetic and nature-loving mindsin a creative fashion....; and that, the roaring sound of lions inducesfear in some and stimulates the valor of a few...., etc. These aresome examples of the natural impacts of sound.... Some specific ef-fects of resonance of sound of different frequencies have also beendiscussed earlier. Just imagine of the synergistic conjunction of thepsychological effects with those wonderful effects of sound...!The words spoken with hatred, anger or affection would create cor-responding ‘matching’ effects in the listeners; even animals respondin accordance with this fact. Because of the linkage between psy-chological and sonic effects, the silent words of thoughts are equallyeffective like the spoken words. For instance, if a person with sacredand serene mentality is sitting near someone who is engrossed incruel or erotic thinking, the former would definitely get some kind ofirritating or repulsive feeling.... The creative and destructive effectsof sound in the form of music are well known. Some more examplesin this regard are listed below that throw light on the interconnectionof music and psychology.While singing a devotional song, lady Levy had seen the NotredameMother Mary in France. The mental absorption in singing and listen-ing of the Bhairav Raga has many times resulted in visual encounterwith the godly manifestation of Bhairav.

Mrs. Bats Heinz is also known to have demonstrated such‘visible effects’ of emotionally empowered music in Lord Litton’sChamber.Telepathy, mesmerism, and hypnotism also work on the sublime link-age of the subtle and gross powers of sound with psychology. Therole of air and electricity (via the electromagnetic waves) is impor-tant in spreading the sonic waves in the space. The bio-electricity andthe bio-magnetism play creative role in the transmission and propaga-tion of the subliminal counterparts of these waves beyond all barriers.There are five forms of pronunciation or expression of thoughts – (i)Vocal, in which, one speaks out audibly; (ii) Mental, in which, thewords are pronounced without lifting the tongue and the sound pro-duced remains inside the throat...; (iii) In this form, only the respira-tion produces the desired words (sound); (iv) The words communi-cated through the deepest inner self (i.e., through the anta¡karaña)– which, although sublime, can reach anywhere in the cosmos andvibrate the aimed nuclei of the omnipresent Supreme Conscious-ness...; (v) An³hata – this non vibrant eternal expression of Ïabdais indeed the form of the self-existent N³da and this cannot be real-ized without the attainment of ultimate success in the N³da Yoga.It is amazing to note that the iÌis had thoroughly incorporated all thescientific aspects of sound and its linkage with spirituality, psychologyand the physical energies in different manifestations of Ïabda in thedevelopment of Mantra Vijó³na. The scientific research into theMantra Vijó³na should focus on these multifaceted dimensions andstudy the possibilities of making use of the mantras for positive ef-fects on the radar of human body and mind while also counter-bal-ancing the noise pollution created by the unchecked modern material-istic development....

Science of MantrasThe essence of Mantra Vijó³na lies in making use the power ofÏabda Brah® on the basis of the subtle science of consciousnessand linking it with the inner purity and divine dignity of the human self.While the sound waves in general are spread in all directions viatransverse motion, the specific configurations of the syllables in themantras make the generated sound waves move upwards. The soundwaves generated by the G³yatri Mantra are found to proceed up-wards in a spiral shape. The vital energy linked with the spiritualforce of consciousness of the s³dhakas exalts these waves up to thecosmic center of Savit³27, which is defined to be the devat³ of thisgreat mantra.When the sonic waves of this mantra are reflected back (reverber-ated) from its cosmic center, they are endowed with the light, elec-tricity and the thermal energies ‘emitted’ from the sun and the su-preme radiance of Savit³. This unique confluence of the gross andsubliminal energies of the sun induces divine impact and inspirationand enlightens the body, mind and the inner self of the devotees. Thededicated s³dhan³ of the G³yatri Mantra thus leads to an overallelevation of life towards the higher realms of human dignity and awak-ens the divinity existing in the human self.The enunciation of mantra brings miraculous effects only if the v³ñºof the reciter is refined up to the level of v³k28 – a pure, true andspiritually sublimated form of voice. The latter can be achieved bysimple practices of Ïabda Yoga provided the prerequisites of therefinement of mentality, character, deeds and emotions are maintainedby the s³dhaka. These could be attained only by consistent obser-vance of self-control and righteous living – endowed with truth, piety,serene love and altruist compassion.

The fourth and the most important factor, is thelevel of ïraddh³ of the disciple in the particular mantra."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86Eternity... Science of MantrasThe ‘elements’ of ether are highly sensitive subtle ‘particles’ which canvibrate at a frequency up to 34 X 109 cps. At the absolute high frequen-cies these oscillatory particles constantly emit a unique light. The radia-tion of this light can travel with a velocity of 107 miles per second.The vibrations of the etheric elements never stop. They are sup-posed to stabilize at the outer layer of the earth’s gravitational sphereand continue vibrating there at constant ultra high frequencies. Theyattract the weaker waves of similar frequencies and get attracted bymore powerful ones of the same range of frequencies. In either case,the superimposition of such compatible vibrations gives rise to an ex-tremely powerful field of attraction. The ‘influencing power’ of thisforce of attraction is also bestowed upon those whose ‘thought waves’match with these suprasonic waves.In the advanced stages of mantra-s³dhan³, the s³dhaka attempts tocommunicate with the superior spiritual experts of the correspondingmantra and tries to tune his own body, mind and sentiments so as tomatch the ‘frequencies’ of the impulse of his inner self with those of thedivine radiation of Ïabda. The s³dhan³ processes of anuÌÚh³na andpuraÌcarana fall under this category. The time periods, methodsand disciplines for performing such s³dhan³s are pre-decided andare specific to the type of mantra and the spiritual level of thes³dhan³. Every action of the daily routine – including the type andquantity of food to be consumed per day etc – are to be strictly fol-lowed as per the disciplines of the relevant s³dhan³.The disciplined japa (in purified v³ni) of a mantra for long time pro-duces enormous energy by arousing the immanent power of Ïabda.This is amplified by the continuous impact and friction generated by thevibrations (of the japa) that contain the sublime energies of the will-power and faith of the s³dhaka. The strength of such energy fields isexponentially magnified during the dedicated and determined ascetics³dhan³s (anuÌÚh³ns) of the same mantra, as compared to that due tojapa for lesser number of times without any ascetic disciplines. Thecentrifugal force of attraction created by the circular, cyclic and upwardmovements of the associated sonic waves (produced by the japa)also is more significant in the former and it induces the ‘potential’ tolink the s³dhaka’s consciousness with thy consciousness.It is a well known scientific principle that continuous movement ofany kind ultimately results in a circular motion. The orbit and shapes"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87Eternity... Science of Mantrasof all the planets in the universe are almost round (or elliptical closedcontours) due to this simple effect. It is by the same principle thatcontinuous (non-stop) japa of a mantra creates a circular domain.The ‘Taila Dh³ravat Sutra’ describes that – ‘If oil is dropped atconstant speed for some time continuously, its flow forms a steadystream. Similarly, the repeated rhythmic enunciation of the same word(or a string of words) forms a continuous (without an end or bound-ary) segment of words’. A popular story in the R³m³yañ³ also givesa simple supportive example here. It describes that iÌi Valmiki’snon-stop chanting of the word mar³ mar³... offered him the saintlyeffect of the japa of the name of the God –– “r³ma r³ma” ....The vaidika mantras are usually recited in specific rhythms as perthe vaidika swaras. However, during the process of japa, the reci-tation of all the mantras takes place at constant amplitude withoutany break or pause. So regular and constant should be the speed thatone can count the number of japas by measuring the time taken forone completion of the japas in one sitting. It is this consistency andcontinuity that gives a cyclic motion to the sonic waves generated bythe japa, and thus helps activation and focusing of the related pow-ers of Ïabda.That circular motion generates energy – can also be observed in day-to-day life; for instance, the movement of the toy ‘top’, or the func-tioning of machines by the movement of a flywheel, etc. Continuousjapa of a mantra in consistent manner, for sufficiently long periodsof time per day, can generate energy in and around the s³dhaka thatwould keep his physical and subtle body creatively active for the restof the day....Fast circular motion at a regular pace generates a centrifugal force.Demonstration of this force can be seen in a circus – in the rotatingswings or the circular motion of a motorbike rider in the ‘well ofdeath’,.... etc. Similar effect helps generation of a supernormal ‘sphere’of sonic energy by the cyclic japa of a mantra repeatedly whilemaintaining the consistency of the pace by thorough engrossment ofthe mind."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88Eternity... Science of MantrasThe Gravity of JapaAs mentioned earlier, japa or chanting of divine hymns has beenregarded as an important spiritual practice in almost all the religionsof the world. In the Indian scriptures of yore the japa-s³dhan³ ofmantras has been designated as a yajóa. God Krishna has thereforeindicated it a paramount yajóa by stating (in the Holy Gºt³) –‘Yajóan³® Japa Yajóosmi’; Meaning: Among all the yajóas I am(existing in) the Japa Yajóa.Lord Manu has mentioned (Manusmiti 2|87) that disregarding whatother spiritual practices one performs, a true Br³h®aña29 can attainsupernatural powers only through a dedicated endeavors of japa.Mah³bh³rata (Ashwa. 44|8) quotes that –– “The Vaidika Yajóas per-formed by herbal sacrifices in the fire along with disciplined chanting ofmantras are indeed important. However, the Japa Yajóa alone, withoutany other requirements (of fire etc.) is sufficient for realizing thy love”.In the later centuries as well, many saints and experts of the IndianPhilosophy have expressed similar views on japa. The following quoteby Goswami Tulasidas, though written in a simple language, conveysa lot about the significance of japa – ‘N³ma Japata Mangal DisiDasah¿a®, Japahi N³mu jan Ârata Bh³ri, Mitahi KusankataHonhi Sukh³rº’.

Increase in inner strength, self-confidence,clarity and refinement of thoughts and sentiments etc. – are its defi-nite effects that gradually lead to the illumination of the innermostcore of the individual self. The following excerpts from religious andspiritual scriptures on Indian Philosophy further signify the great roleof this apparently simple practice.From Ling Pur³ña (8|5|124-125) – “One who sincerely performsjapa would never face any calamity. The devil powers of Yakïa,R³kïasa, Piï³ca, BºÌaña (ghosts, witches etc.) can never reach nearhim. Japa helps uprooting the kusamsk³ras30.

Science of MantrasLinguistic Meaning and Types of JapaThe word japa in the Sanskrit language is defined as – ‘Japa Vyakt³y³®V³ci’ and ‘Japa M³nase Ca’; Meaning: enunciate clearly and also sayit mentally. Repeated rhythmic enunciation of a mantra with unper-turbed mental concentration is defined as the japa of that mantra. TheAgni Pur³ña explains this as below –Jak³ro Janma Vicchedaha Pak³ra¡ P³pa N³ïaka¡ |Tasy³jjapa Iti Prokto Janma P³pa Vin³ïakah ||Meaning: ‘Ja’ implies the transition of birth (life) and ‘pa’ means –calling for thee through the inner heart. Thus ‘japa’ is equivalent to bethe spiritual endeavor that destroys all sins and the bonds of birth anddeath.Swami Ramakrishna Paramhansa explains it more perspicuously as– “japa means recalling thou name in silence, through the mind andthe inner self ”. Japa is described by some scholars as the proce-dure for the realization of the Almighty and is therefore also definedas – ‘consistent illumination of the deepest inner self’.The practice of japa can be performed in several ways. The differenttypes of japa suitable for every one are described below in brief.1. Nitya Japa: The regular practice of japa is as essential for thedaily exercise of the subtle body as the processes of bathing andeating etc for the healthy sustenance of the physical body. The NityaJapa is performed as a necessary part of the daily routine. Thespecific mantra as guided by one’s spiritual master is enunciated ev-eryday for specified number of times, while meditating upon the devat³of that mantra. The time slot and the place for performing this dailyspiritual exercise should also be regular. The siting posture during thejapa is also supposed to be the same every day as prescribed underthe japa–disciplines. Sukh³sana with erect spinal cord is supposedto be a universally suited posture for this purpose. In the state ofphysical illness or during travelling..., etc, these disciplines are re-laxed as per the circumstances and the japa is performed mentallyduring the specific time period every day."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93Eternity... Science of MantrasThe consistent practice of Nitya Japa gradually wanes out the evilsexisting in the s³dhaka and prevents the entry of the new ones. Si-multaneously, it strengthens the subtle power of the s³dhaka at asteadily increasing pace.2. Naimittika Japa : This type of japa is performed with the nobleaim of expressing gratitude towards the – ancestors or the relativesand friends or great saints or dedicated social reformers etc – whoare no more. Specific mantras, as quoted for this purpose in theVedas and the related scriptures, are recited during the period of Pita Pakïa The type of the mantra and the methods (disciplines) for itsjapa depend upon the type and the emotional level of the gratitude.The effect of this japa offers peace to the concerned departed soul(s).The Naimittika Japa is also performed to offer prayers with a feel-ing of gratitude to thy power on some auspicious days/time periodslike Am³vasy³, P¿rñim³, Ek³daïi, Ïivar³tri, Navar³tra etc.3.K³mya Japa: The japa performed for some special purpose –such as attainment of a noble worldly or spiritual goal – fall under thiscategory. The period and disciplines for this japa depend upon thenature and spiritual level of the s³dhaka and the purpose of his en-deavor. Because of their materialistic attachments, some people of-ten find it attractive to perform such japas for mere worldly achieve-ments; they, however, should note that – the true benefit of japacomes in the form of sacred improvement in one’s own qualities andattitude towards the altruist goals of global welfare. This japa educesdivine inspirations in the s³dhaka which ‘guide’ the path towardsspiritual evolution.4. NiÌiddha Japa: As mentioned earlier, in every kind of japa, like inany other spiritual practice (s³dhan³), the observance of certain dis-ciplines is a must. The success of the japa s³dhan³ remains doubt-ful without proper disciplines and faith.A common set of necessary disciplines to be observed during theperiod of the s³dhan³ includes – purity of the body, mind and char-acter; self control over temper (mood) and worldly desires; avoid-ance of erotic excitations; maintenance of restricted and austere dietor fasting and observance of couple of other Yama–Niyama, like,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94Eternity... Science of Mantrasnonviolence, honesty, self-reliance in routine activities, sincere par-ticipation in some activity of service and help for the true welfare ofthe society as a whole.Above all, devotion and faith in the mantra, in the gur¿ – who hasinspired and initiated (via dikï³) the s³dhaka towards the japa-s³dhan³, and in the omnipresent thy power, thy generosity and disci-plines are also integral parts of an adept japa-s³dhan³. The feelingof oneness with the divine source and power (devat³) of the mantraduring the japa, ensures the success of such a s³dhan³.Any kind of japa-s³dhan³, performed without the observance ofthe essential disciplines, is regarded improper and is therefore calleda NiÌiddha (prohibited) Japa.5. Pr³yaïcita Japa: According to the Indian philosophy – “Life is aneternal and continuous process. The soul has to transit through differ-ent forms of life depending upon the accumulated effects of the karmain the previous births....”. The assimilated mental instincts of the pre-vious lives and the inherent effects of the actions conducted in thoselives may continue to show their presence as different kinds ofsamsk³ras (intrinsic tendencies) in one’s present life too. Thekusamsk³ras might trigger one to commit some inhumane acts/sins.Even the unconscious thinking and sensual desires of the human bodyin the present life could also contribute in this direction. The elimina-tion of such inherent and acquired kusamsk³ras and sins is a musttowards the refinement and true progress of one’s materialistic aswell as spiritual life as a human being.The Indian science of spirituality gives significant importance to thes³dhan³s prescribed to meet the above objective. The Pr³yaïcitaJapa belongs to this class of s³dhan³s. Here, Japas of specificmantras under different kinds of disciplines are advised (by the Gur¿)depending upon the type of sins or evil or amoral deeds for which thepr³yaïcita (penance, atonement) is sought for and upon the spirituallevel of the s³dhaka.6. Acala Japa: In this kind of japa the determination of the s³dhakais of predominant importance. One begins this japa with a pledge like"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95Eternity... Science of Mantras– he will not change the posture (sitting or standing) until a fixed,sufficiently large, number of japas of the specified mantra are com-pleted...... The resolution is followed consistently every day for along period of time till that becomes a habit. These types of japassubstantially enhance the willpower, courage and mental stability ofthe s³dhakas.7. Cala Japa: This name corresponds to the japa (of a specifiedmantra) that could be performed anywhere at any time as per thesuitability of the s³dhaka. This japa should be performed every timewhenever the mind is free or not occupied in any scrupulous work.....This japa helps prevent the diversion of mind towards unnecessarythoughts and controls its fickle nature and thereby sharpens thes³dhaka’s mental concentration. As the mind is naturally engaged inrecalling thy name during the japa of any mantra, it is automaticallytrained and tuned to receive the sacred thought waves...... Thistype of japa is the easiest and should be practiced by each one of us.8. V³cika Japa: In this kind of japa, the mantras are recited in sucha manner that they could be easily audible to the other people in closedvicinity. Lord Manu has described this japa as ten times more effec-tive than the vidhi yajóa. This is a simple and elementary kind ofjapa. This japa is often advised for the beginners because, it iseasier for them to concentrate the mind while they utter the givenmantra loudly....The V³cika Japa is also perfromed – under certain disciplines ofrhythmic enunciation, consistency of amplitude and pitch etc – as anexercise in some Ïabda Yogas to train the v³ñº (voice and its subtlerreflections) for specific purposes. It is also endeavored to awakenthe varña bºja (the latent power of consciousness) in the ÌaÚ cakras.9. Up³nïu Japa: According to the descriptions in Manu Smati (2|85),this type of japa is the one in which the enunciation of the mantrasis carried out in such a way that the movements of the lips of thes³dhaka may be seen but his voice would not be audible. Lord Manuhas cited the importance of this japa to be hundred times greaterthan the vidhi yajóa. The s³dhan³ (disciplined practice with faithand serenity) of the up³nïu japa makes one introvert and helps inthe realization of the subtle body."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96Eternity...

The lips and ears are kept closed, even the tongueneed not move. This japa is performed only with the help of thepr³ña v³yu inhaled by breathing.The above kind of japa is an important part of the initial practices ofthe N³da Yoga This japa also helps attain yogika tandr³ (a state oftrance) and a gentle activation of the Ìat cakras. In the successfulstate of this japa-s³dhan³, the s³dhaka can see (feel) the presenceof a unique divine light inside the body. Trenchant rise in his intelli-gence and the power of prudent discretion...., etc, are mere offshootsof this success.11. M³nasika Japa: This japa is performed silently only in the mind.The syllables of the selected mantra are mentally visualized and alongwith this mental recitation, the mind is focused upon the meaning ofthat mantra. The importance of this type of japa s³dhan³ is quotedsignificantly in the Manu Smati (2|86), Viïñu Pur³ña (9|56), VadaP³r³ïara (4|57). The effect of this japa is described as thousandstimes more powerful than that of the vidhi yajóa.According to a noted scholar, Pt. Dinanath Shastri, the voice (namely,the Baikhari V³ñº,) used in speech has a limited power as comparedto that of its successively subtler forms – the Madhyam³, Païyantiand Par³ V³ñºs. As the M³nasika Japa involves use of the subtlev³ñº, it is significantly more effective than the V³cika Japa.As per the ancient quote – ‘Mantri Gupta Bh³ïañ’, the sublimepower of a mantra can be activated by the m³nasika japa. Thes³dhan³ of this japa helps the activation and proper utilization of thebioelectrical field inside the body of the s³dhaka. This japa alsoaffects the etheric vibrations with the help of the latent power ofÏabda indwelling in the mantra.12. AkhanÃa Japa: Although the word-meaning here suggests somekind of non-stop japa, but, practically it implies that – apart fromspending time on the daily routines essential for the healthy mainte-nance of the physical body, the s³dhaka’s mind should always be"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97Eternity... Science of Mantrasengaged within the domain of mantra-japa.

Simpleguidelines for this type of japa are given by the iÌis in the fol-lowing Ïlok³:Jap³cch³nta¡ Punardhy³yed Dhy³n³cch³nta¡ Punarjapet |Japadhy³n Upariïr³nta Âtm³na® Ca Vic³rayet ||Meaning: If one (the s³dhaka) is tired of the japa, he should beginmeditation....; if tired of meditation then japa should be re-started...;when tired of both, one should begin self-analysis or sw³dhy³ya.Sincere practice of the Akhan¿a Japa has been defined as a kind oftapa33 whose success leads to great spiritual accomplishments.13. Ajap³ Japa: With normal respiration rate we breathe (in andout) about 21600 times per 24 hrs. While inhaling, it sounds like ‘Soa’and makes a natural sound of ‘Ham’ upon exhaling. This way theHa®sa Mantra – ‘Soha®’ is always being ‘practised’ by us in anatural way with our each breathing cycle..... This cyclic ‘japa’ withdue concentration and feeling of exhaling the ego and vices with thesound of “So” and inhaling and absorbing thy Ïabda with the soundof “Ha®” –– is termed as the ajap³ japa of the G³yatrº Mantra orthe Atma Mantra.The practice of meditation to realize the flows of the vital energyalong with each ajap³ japa is defined as a prominent s³dhan³ ofthe Pr³ñ Yajóa. The holy Gºt³ also affirms it as – Pr³ñ³ni Pr³ñepuJuvhati. Swami Sridhar has defined the pr³ña yajóa as the spiritualprocess of ajap³ japa.

Science of MantrasPractices & Effects Associated with JapaEngrossment of mind in the meaning, implication, or the divine feelingassociated with a mantra – is essential for adept practising of anykind of japa. This, not only trains the mind for sharp concentrationand deeper meditation, but also helps its purification via removal ofthe assimilated kusamsk³ras – pertaining to the evil instincts of jeal-ous, lust, anger, arrogance and insidious addictions etc. Once themind is cleaned the intrinsic afflatus and effects begin to mark theirimpressions on it.... This subsequently results in the cultivation of vir-tuous mental abilities and creative talents together with distinct moralelevation. Japa is described in almost all religions as the best exer-cise for the preliminary training and enlightenment of mind.By repeated and continuous movements, even a rope, used for fetch-ing water from a well, can leave its mark on the stones around thewall of the well. Domestic animals, even if let free, return back totheir masters just because of habit.... The animals of the circus com-panies become master performers by rigorous training and repeatedpractice. Be that a wrestler, a good student or a dedicated scien-tist...., each one gains success only after a scrupulous effort and sin-cere practice..... Continuous collection of small drops can fill the wholetank... These and similar well known examples signify the necessityas well as the sufficiency of regular practice for the achievement ofperfection in any training.... The same holds true for the conditioningand refinement of mind by the s³dhan³ of japa. The disciplinedendeavor of japa is therefore also termed as a yajóa. Meditation(dhy³na) and japa are mutually complementary and essentially co-existing in every kind of mantra-s³dhan³.The Significance of Ïabda S³dhan³:Japa is regarded as a prominent spiritual endeavor towards the real-ization of the subtle power of Ïabda.

Science of MantrasAs Ïabda is attributed to be the eternal source, the root cause, of thecreation of the cosmos, any attempt for the realization of the sublimi-nal dimensions ‘beyond’ the universe would be futile without makinga perfect use of the omnipotent power of Ïabda. Accomplishing theïabda-s³dhan³ or the japa-yoga is said to take the s³dhaka’s mindin a state beyond the periphery of ‘time and space’, in the higherdimensions of Ïabda.... The scriptures on the science of this ïabda-s³dhan³ (mantra-s³dhan³) have described four kinds of V³ñºs35,namely, Baikharº, Madhyam³, Païyanti and Par³.The baikharº v³ñº refers to our usual voice (used for conversation,oration etc); the other three are its successive subtler forms.Madhyam³ is identified as the silent voice of thoughts and intuitionand is a medium for gradually traversing from the level of the baikharºto païyanti by dedicated ïabda s³dhan³. The païyanti v³ñº is the‘voice’ of inner sentiments, inspirations and intrinsic messages. Theyogis describe the functional domain of madhyam³ as expandingfrom the sahastr³ra cakra to the hadaya cakra36. Realizationand perfection over the use of madhyam³ evolves the individual selffrom the state of animal instincts to the state of divine instincts. Itleads to the liberation of mind from selfish, materialistic attachments,and helps further evolution of the v³ñº as the voice of the “self be-yond the gross being”. This is the state of realization and expressionof païyanti and eventually of the par³.

The ancient scripture on yogadarïana (c.f. sections 4|1, 1|14, 1|28-29 for instance) state that –‘The properly disciplined and devoted japa s³dhan³ can take thes³dhaka into a state of deep trance. It eliminates the obstacles from thepath of spiritual elevation of the s³dhaka and illuminates his inner selfby the divine radiance. The s³dhaka eventually enjoys the beatifiedbliss that can never be attained even by the mightiest, wealthiest andthe happiest (in worldly sense) person in the world. The noted saint,exceptionally brilliant scholar and social reformer, Swami Ramtirtha,upon reaching this stage, used to describe it as – “This has made mea Ram Badshah (i.e. the happy and mighty ‘king’ of the world)”....The spiritual practice of japa can be attempted by anybody, any-where.... Patience, faith (without any fear or selfish interest) andthe sincerity and purity of mind are the only preconditions. In fact, thelevel of these qualities also begins to improve if the japa s³dhan³ isbeing performed under adept disciplines.Modern scientific experiments have confirmed that the japa regu-lates the reciter’s respiration in a way similar to that offered by someof the exercises of pr³ñ³y³ms. It reduces the breathing rate to halfits normal average. That means, on an average, one hour’s disci-plined practice of the japa yoga would augment the life of the s³dhakaby about five hundred breaths at least! Japa therefore could also beadvised as an important health-exercise.As mentioned earlier, the effects of japa awaken one’s inherent vir-tues that naturally result in an overall improvement in his personality,and amelioration of his physical and mental potentials. These positiveeffects can be used for noble success in terms of worldly progress aswell. It is the willpower and the vision, aroused by the japa that‘transform’ the difficult circumstances and obstacles into minor onesin a miraculous manner."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102Eternity... Science of MantrasSome Scientific Points:The subtle (mental) body likewise the gross (physical) body of everyhuman being consists of a complex network of interconnected extra-sensory ‘nerves’. The vibrations produced during a japa are not sosignificant in the gross body as that in the subtle body. Its ‘latentnerves’ do vibrate in complete harmony with the sonic pattern of themantra. These subtle vibrations stimulate the specific nodes of theextrasensory operations. The activation of these nodes (sublime cen-ters of inner consciousness) is indeed responsible for emergence ofastonishing inner strength and supernatural faculties of the s³dhaka.The gradual and controlled arousal of the subtle nuclei of pr³ña37 el-evates the s³dhaka’s individual self into higher spiritual realms endowedwith divine virtues. It is said that the people of Vedika Age in India wereardent ascetic s³dhakas of such noble caliber that each one of themwas a living expression of divine powers –– whence the mention of 33crores manifestations of God in the Shastrika Literature.Essential Disciplines for Japa S³dhan³:The aforesaid supernormal benefits of japa are attainable only if thejapa is performed as a spiritual s³dhan³ – with absolute faith, sin-cerity and piety (of thoughts, sentiments and conduct) under unper-turbed observance of the prescribed disciplines.Some common disciplines essential for every kind of japa s³dhan³are – the cleanliness of the body and mind of the s³dhaka and that ofthe place and its surroundings where the japa is performed. Thecalm and stable state of the s³dhaka’s mind is a natural requirementfor meditation during japa. The following guidelines are usually pre-scribed to meet these pre-requisites. Japa should be performed in aneat and tidy condition of the body, after having bath, wearing cleancloths etc. The clothing should also be such that the body would befree and relaxed while sitting in the posture of sukh³sana38, which issupposed to be the most soothing sitting posture for japa. Wearingshoes or use of leather is also prohibited during all japa s³dhanas.The s³dhaka should sit on a clean cloth sheet or kuï³sana spreadover the floor in a silent corner of the house or any suitable placeoutside, which is neat and peaceful."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103Eternity... Science of MantrasWhile performing a japa, the s³dhaka should let his mind free fromevery kind of negative thinking, anger, jealous, excitement, etc. Thes³dhaka should face the East in the morning, North in the noon andthe West in the evening and should feel the presence of the divineillumination in the corresponding direction. According to the scriptureentitled “Tantra S³ra”, the purity and engrossment of the mind andcontinence over the body-functions –– is a must for a sincere prac-tice of japa. The Kul³ñava Tantra adds that the s³dhaka shouldeat self-earned austere vegetarian (s³tvika) food.The speed of japa should be normal and set at one’s natural fre-quency of speech. It should not be too slow so as to cause dullness,neither too fast that would cease the clarity of pronunciation. TheÏ³stras also mention that grasping control over the bodily actions,vital energy and mental agility and strengthening the ïraddh³ andviïv³sa in the presence of Ïiva and Ïakti39 is necessary for theattainment of ultimate success (siddhi) in a japa-s³dhan³.Pictures and idols of the manifestation of God in whom the s³dhakahas affectionate faith, or, posters/ photographs of some saints andgreat personalities often provide inspiring company at such places.Performance of some rituals of worship, presence of fresh flowersand plants in the surroundings add to the purity and serene beauty ofthis atmosphere. With gradual progress in the s³dhan³, the refine-ment of the sublime domains of consciousness in and around thes³dhaka also becomes more important. In order to maintain the sa-cred ambience, only the people of high moral character and piety ofmind should be allowed to visit the place of s³dhan³.According to the Ling Pur³ña (85|106-8) the japa performed in thehouse gives average benefit, that performed on a bank of a river isover one lakh times more effective and this positive impact is furtherenhanced if the japa is performed at a spiritually energized temple or³ïrama of a saint, at a mountain of the holy Himalayas or in front of– a cow, the divine Dhruva T³r³ (the pole star), rising Sun, fire of ahavan kuñÃa, or a dºpaka (a lamp of refined ghee). The effect ofjapa is maximized if it is performed with an awakened feeling ofthou-presence in the s³dhaka’s own inner self."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104Eternity...

Science of MantrasExperiments on Mantra: Interaction of Sound with  Thermal EnergyMaharshi Aurbindo has stated that – the human intellect has, no doubt,achieved a lot by deciphering, through scientific developments, thesecrets of Nature at certain cosmic as well as atomic and micro lev-els. However, the greater part – that, dealing with the consciousness,still remains to be seen. We shall focus here on some such aspects inthe context of mantra s³dhan³.V³ñº – voice, including the speech of the thoughts and the emotions –happens to be most significant among all the apparent or latent poten-tials of consciousness bestowed upon the human beings. This divinebequest has been at the root of making the communication and ex-pansion of knowledge and information possible in real terms. It wouldbe frightening to imagine the status of the human society without thiswonderful gift of v³ñº. Apart from its obvious role at the social andeducational levels, the v³ñº – being a tool for manifestation of ïabda– also plays a crucial role in spiritual developments. As mentionedearlier, the mantra-s³dhan³ triggers an ‘explosion’ of the power ofïabda via the medium of refined v³ñº.It is well known that we are able to pronounce uncountable variety ofphonemes and syllables with enormous flexibility of pitch and ampli-tude because of the simultaneous movements and associative func-tioning of the lips, teeth, throat and the vocal cord along with thetongue. If it were only a single component, say the tongue alone thatproduced ‘voice’ then the human beings would have been able toutter only a limited numb1er of phonemes (sounds) like most animalsand birds too. The simultaneous movement of several interconnectedcomponents of the vocal system also creates vibrations in the linkages ofthe latter with the nervous system and the brain and thus makes thehuman voice so special. These vibrations (generated by the flow of ourv³ñº), because of their connections with the brain, also induce micro-subtler effects on may many intra-body functions as well.As mentioned earlier, the combination of specific syllables and vow-els in the mantras is so designed that the japa of a particular mantra"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106Eternity... Science of Mantraswould have definite effects on some specific functional centers anddomains of the hidden source of life. The latter include – the ÌaÚcakras, the three extrasensory ‘knots’ (granthis), the three n³Ãºs(the latent energy currents/canals along the endocrine column), daïpr³ñas (ten streams of pr³ña), 72000 nerves and muscles and the54 upatyik³s endowed in a living human-body.The dreaded dangers of noise pollution on the one hand and the amazingapplications of the ultra and infra sound on the other, illustrate that –the syllables and words spoken or heard are much more than merecarriers of information. That, music is more powerful as a means forcreativity, sentimental thrust, medical therapy, improvement in agri-cultural production and psychosomatic health than as a tool for enter-tainment – is also well recognized by the world. Music has now be-come an important part of school education in the high-tech countrieslike Japan in order to help create the feelings of compassion, co-operation and discipline among the children.It is a scientifically established fact that sound is a source as well asa form of energy. It is found that even the ordinary audible sound, ifrepeated continuously at a constant frequency and amplitude can pro-duce so much thermal energy as would be produced by the boilingwater. The principles and methods of Mantra Vijó³na are aimed atsublimation of sound to it original expression – Ïabda, and construc-tive orientation of the enormous energy generated by such explo-sions. The different practices of japa and homa (i.e. a havan oryajóa) associated with the mantras are devised according to themantra vijó³na. While the role of sonic and (bio)electrical energy isevident in the japa processes, that of the thermal energy is moreevident in the yajóa based practices.The different types and steps of japa have been discussed earlier.Before looking into the meaning of yajóa and its relation with themantra vijó³na, it should be further emphasized that apart from thegeneration and use of the physical forms of energy, the most significantand unique field of the science of mantras deals with the sublime forceof consciousness and the associated realms of supernatural energy.The role of inner faith and emotional and sentimental depth, togetherwith mental concentration is therefore given more importance in the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107Eternity... Science of Mantraspractices of mantra vijó³na and several ‘rituals’ are advised to-wards necessary training exercises before practicing a mantra.At the gross level, the sonic waves of a mantra generate specificcurrents of energy by vibrating even the tiniest particle in and aroundthe s³dhaka. At the subtle level, via the spiritual power of ïraddh³of the s³dhaka in the mantra, it gives rise to a ‘conscious force’ thateduces a sublime ‘magnetic’ attraction.... Thus the s³dhan³ of amantra japa generates two types of energy spheres. These spheresof energy are termed respectively as the sonic sphere (dhwani vatta) and the emotional sphere (bh³va vatta). If performed with asteadily intensifying ïraddh³, the expansion, and strength (the powerof attraction) of these energy fields gains cosmic dimensions by long-term regular repetition of the mantra under prescribed spiritual disci-plines. The Sudarïana Cakra depicted in a hand of God Vishnuindicates the eternal power of these ever-active energy- spheres ofthe gross and the subtle energies of Ïabda.Absolute salvation of the soul (mokïa) – is referred as the ultimategoal of many spiritual experiments. Considering that omnipresent eter-nal ocean of consciousness is an infinite dimensional ensemble of theperpetual currents of the waves of Ïabda, it should be understoodthat the subliminal (conscious) energy sphere (aura) spun by a man-tra s³dhan³ is a kind of orbit. Continuous engrossed movement inthis orbit could drive the mind and the inner self freely across theunbounded ocean of ïabda by eliminating (via counter flows) thethralldom of the other fields of attraction – e.g. those of worldlycravings, ego and related passions, etc....). This liberation of mind is areal mokïa for a human being.Agnihotra and Japa:Performing some kind of agnihotra or a yajóa is essential beforecommencing and after completing the determined spiritual experi-ments of anuÌÚh³na with mantra japa. In some mantra s³dhan³sthis needs to be performed every day along with the regular japaprocessing.Agnihotra or yajóa is a simple process of sacrificing selected dryherbs in the fire kindled in a specifically designed small inverted pyra-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108Eternity... Science of Mantrasmid shaped pot (or pit) called havan kunÃa. The material used inagnihotra – including the dry herbs/ woods – is also purified bymantra japas and some s³dhan³s. The naturally broken dry woodsfrom only a selected varieties of trees are allowed to be used. Thevalid types of medicinal herbs also are the ones that nourish and in-duce good health and do not cause any kind of insidious effects likepoisonous vapors or polluting smokes. The material to be used in anagnihotra should be collected by the s³dhaka from the places whichare already purified by continuous performances of sacred s³dhan³sor yajóas and mantra anuÌÚh³nas.....The electrified particles of the herbal-material sublimated in the yajóa-fire, because of the special design of the havan kunÃa move upwardin a spiral manner at an ultra fast rate. The mantra- chanting per-formed along with a yajóa intensifies the thermal and electromag-netic effects of the latter to further energize the sonic vibrations ofthe mantra and expand them at cosmic levels. The effects of themantra-japa thus get compounded magnificently and offer manifoldbenefits to vast domain.The thermal energy generated by the yajóa-fire and the collisions ofsonic waves with the thin screen of its flames help exponential ampli-fication of the power of ïabda in the mantra being chanted. Thespiral waves of electrons in the yajóa-vapor play the role of trans-mitters to ‘communicate’ the ‘signals of the mantra’ in the ethericwhole. The positive effects of the mantra-japa that could otherwisebe received in a limited space surrounding the s³dhaka are thusmagnified and spread in significantly large domains –– even of cos-mic dimensions in specific cases, if the japa is also accompanied bya yajóa.If such experiments of mantra s³dhan³s with yajóas are performedunder adept disciplines, the unique confluence of the thermal and sonicenergies linked with the eternal flow of consciousness in the ethericmedium –– would offer global benefits at physical as well as spirituallevels. Such boons would range from purification of atmosphere, har-monizing the ecological balances, improvement in the physical andmental health of the masses.... to the spiritual enlightenment of allbeings."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109Eternity... Science of MantrasPossibilities of Scientific Research:The use of fire and thermal energy in general has been advancingever since the beginning of civilization. Scientific and technologicaladvancement of the 20th century has also offered tremendous appli-cations of sound. Scientific experiments on the conjunction of theseenergies – based on the principles of mantra-japa and yajóaanuïth³na – should also be carried out in order to investigate thepossibilities of viable global benefits keeping in total harmony withmultiple realms of life and Nature. Controlled experiments could bedesigned in this regard to perform large scale yajóas with consistentcollective chanting of the selected vaidika mantras and test thechanges, if any, in the ionosphere40 thereby.Comprehensive research in the science of mantra and yajóa woulddemand an in-depth study of – (i) the physical (including chemicaland biological) and subtle powers of sound and heat; (ii) the power ofattraction and the gross structure as well as subliminal domain of thecosmic centers associated with the devat³s of different mantras.For instance, the manifold physical and subtle power-currents of thesun and the orgulous effects of meditation on its subtle body (savit³)should be researched in the context of the G³yatrº-Yajóas.....; (iii)fundamental principles of transformation of matter and energy; and(iv) human psychology and the deeper science of inner emotions andsentiments.While the physical powers of sound and heat have been recognizedand used by the modern science at a very advanced level, a lot re-mains to be deciphered on their sublime fronts. The studies of thecosmic nuclei of mantras and those of the sentimental powers wouldalso demand detailed study of the vaidika scriptures, before one in-vestigates the scientific methods for experimental investigations andapplications of mantra japa and yajóa.

This is how the attainment ofthe desired/resolved noble goals becomes feasible by performing themantra anuÌÚh³na with yajñas.The feasibility of the aforesaid astonishing effects could be betterunderstood if we realize that –– sentiments and emotions, being mani-festations of Ïabda also exist as some kinds of ‘super-ultra’ or ‘mi-cro-infra’ sonic waves, i.e., the waves that are finer and subliminalexpressions of Ïabda as compared to the ultra and infra sound waves.Whatever we think deeply or feel intrinsically is indeed an expression inthe ‘voice’ of our inner mind....

Maharshi Jaimini has analyzed theseaspects in the vedic treatise entitled ‘P¿rva Mºm³ns³’. According tohis analysis, the pram³ñya ïakti deals with the words, phonetics,pronunciations, expression of thy- call and the configuration and or-der of the mantra.The phal prad³na ïakti implies the power of achieving the desiredor determined goal. It is awakened by thorough purification (by pre-scribed mantra-based methods and with due support of inner zealand sincerity) of the kunÃa, samidh³, p³tra, ³jyacar¿, havi, pºÚha,etc, used in the yajóa.

The constant functioning of each of them atmultiple levels generates (bio) electrical currents through the brain-system. Major activities of the body are accompanied by mutual in-teraction between its tiny constituent parts – from organ to cellularand molecular levels. The processes of heart-beating, blood flowthrough the veins and arteries, inhalation and exhalation of air by thelungs, expansion and compression of the muscles, bio-electrical sig-nal (information) processing through the nerves, etc, all produce somekind of friction or titillation in the associated components. This gener-ates specific kind of thermal energy and static electricity.The thought waves continuously generated from the mind are ofelectromagnetic type. If we throw a stone in a pond, it will producecertain currents of water, which will flow transversely up to the banksof the pond. The universe also is a kind of ‘a gigantic pond withoutboundaries’ and hence an infinite open ‘spherical set’ in hyper-geomet-ric sense. The electromagnetic currents produced by our thoughts andemotions are expanded in the limitless domain of this etheric ocean. And,because of the end-less (hence circular) ‘periphery’ of the latter, thesewaves reach back to their point of origin (i.e., our mind, in this case) uponcompleting a cycle.The long journey of the thought waves is not static. A lot of their(bio)magnetic energy is dissipated while interacting with other wavesof opposite characteristics (pertaining to the counter or negativethoughts/emotions). Their confluence with the thought waves of similar"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118Eternity... Science of Mantrasqualities, however, strengthens their own power. The super-imposition ofthese ‘matching’ thought waves indeed creates a powerful region ofattraction and builds up a thought layer or field that could influenceother thought waves. Our righteous and saintly thoughts and emo-tions could this way offer benefits to us and the others as well whilecompounding their power manifold with each cycle. Such layers ofdivine thoughts are like clouds, which can enshower a nectar of virtu-ous inspirations on the entire world.The vibrations of mantras carry immense energy that is amplified bythe pr³ña and bio-electricity of the body and the sublime currents ofspiritually refined thoughts and sentiments of the s³dhaka(s).The simple principle behind our speech or the pronunciation of a wordby our mouth is that – the collision of air with specific (as per themovement of the associated components of the mouth) portions ofthe nervous system produces specific vibrations in the vocal-cord.This apparently physiological process is completely regulated by themind. It is the unconscious mind that guides the controlling machineryof the brain and hence regulates the movements of the componentsthat ‘directly’ participate in the process of speaking or singing etc.The instantaneous difference in our voice and pattern of pronuncia-tion of the same word under different moods (mental states) clearlydemonstrates this remarkable harmony between the speech-systemand the mind.If we casually pet somebody’s back then there would be no reactionin general. However, if we do so intentionally or say, in an angrymood, it would naturally hurt that person and may invite repellingaction from his side. This simple example illustrates the differencebetween the effects of a mere physical activity and that of an actionassociated with unusual mental force. This difference in effects ex-ists because the former involves only the static electricity of the bodyand routine auto-regulation of the brain whereas the latter bears thespecial ‘electrified charge’ of the vital spiritual power of the mindtoo. The words recited by a person with full mental concentration areindeed energized by the bio-electrical energy of the physical body aswell as the ‘electromagnetic’ and subliminal pr³ñic force of his mind."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119Eternity... Science of MantrasIt is well known that the speed of the vibrations of light is around186000 per second while the sound waves have so far been found toproduce vibrations in ether at a speed ranging between very low(subtle) to the ultra levels of 2305793009213693952 vibrations persecond. Our ears can normally catch (hear) only the sonic vibrationsof average frequencies around 32770 per second. The ultra fastvibrations of sound produce higher energy waves including the X-rays. Likewise any other energy-waves, the vibrations produced bythe sound of the words spoken (or sung) by a person also are ever-lasting.... Where they would reach and continue to reside (exist alongwith similar vibrations) in the cosmos depends upon the total energy–especially the mental one because it is more specific to the individualself – emitted by the body and mind of the speaker (singer)....Because of their immense sublimated energy the vibrations of themantras practised by the iÌis and the currents of the thought wavesof these spiritually refined angelic personalities exist in the supernor-mal cosmic energy-fields since yore. Rich belts of minerals are formedby the attraction between the particles of same (compatible) cat-egory. By similar effects, the above mentioned fields of attraction in-duced by the mantra-s³dhan³s of the iÌis would continue to be stron-ger if the matching vibrations of mantras are consistently generatedwith deep ïraddh³ by people endowed with piety of character and innerstrength of mind. In their circular journey (cycles), the s³dhaka’s thoughtwaves and the sound waves generated by his mantra-japa are alsoempowered by these cosmic fields. Thus, while reaching back to theirorigin, these waves help enhance the spirituality and the overall physicaland mental energies of the s³dhaka.Thoughts and emotions, being the manifestations of Ïabda, are also aform of energy like sound and heat. Scientifically speaking, every combi-nation, be that gross or subtle, of vibration and motion gives rise to energy(and matter). Thoughts and emotions also exist in waveforms. These‘energy- waves’, if focussed around one idea or faith, naturally form acommon class and generate a stronger field of attraction around thiscenter of focus...... At gross psychological levels, the distinct ambianceof specific philosophical or political ideologies like those of the religiousdoctrines or those of capitalism, communalism.... etc, are examples ofsuch centered groups of thoughts and beliefs. In the sublime do-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120Eternity... Science of Mantrasmains, the focus of a field of the sacred thoughts and inner senti-ments – like faith, ïraddh³ and spirituality, is called adhi devat³.Every mantra has its (adhi) devat³ that represents a divine powerand a cosmic energy center in the field of the genesis, ultimate ex-pansion and sublimated existence of the sonic waves of that mantra.It is this devat³, which is supposed to be the eternal source (the soul)of the supernormal power of the associated mantra. As mentionedearlier, the success of a mantra-s³dhan³ depends upon how wellthe s³dhaka is able to link his soul with the devat³ of the mantra.This is why the ‘success of a mantra’ is often described as ‘bless-ings or boons bestowed by the devat³’.For the purpose of ease in meditation, the devat³s of various man-tras were also given visible forms and names46 by the iÌis. The bºjaand chanda described in the introductory part (viniyoga) of a man-tra similarly correspond to the subtle wave-characteristics and thesonic pattern of that mantra.The G³yatrº Mantra is regarded to be the origin (mother) of all thevaidika mantras hence of the Vedas too. This is why it is also re-ferred as a mah³mantra and revered as Vedam³t³. The majesticpower of this eternal mantra is expanding perpetually, as the s³dhan³of this mantra has been constantly practised by millions of spiritualexperts since the Vedic Age. Every human being can illuminate hisintellect and inner self by the afflatus of thy-glow through sincerejapa and up³san³ of the G³yatrº Mantra.***"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121Eternity... Science of MantrasPower of Ïabda Aroused by The G³yatrº MantraThe Dray³mal Shastra defines the term mantra as –Manan³t Tr³ñan³cyaiva Madr¿ Pasy³vabodhan³t |Mantra Ityucyate Samyak Mad³dhiÌÚh³nata Priye ||Meaning: That whose mental retention and repetition enables one toknow the true form of the world and the Nature. That which liberatesthe mind from the worldly attachments of ego and avarice and whichleads to the path of ultimate success – is called a Mantra.Similarly, Japa is defined in the scripture of Yama as –Jak³ro Janm Viccheda¡, Prak³ra P³pa N³ïaka¡ |Tasm³jjaya Iti Proktau Janma P³pa Vin³ïaka¡ ||Meaning: “Ja” implies relief from further janmas (Births); “Pa” sym-bolizes elimination of the sins. Thus japa (of a mantra) helps de-stroy one’s evils and liberate the soul from all worldly thralldoms.The above definitions further intensify the importance of mantra-japa described earlier. The scriptures and the experiences of greats³dhakas of all ages affirm that mantra-japa is a spiritual experi-ment that, if performed as a s³dhan³, leads to self-realization, self-refinement and ultimate beatitude. From a scientific point of view,one may explain it as follows. As the continuous movement of themotor in a Dynamo generates electricity, the cyclic repetition of thejapa of a mantra at a constant pace also gives rise to the circularmotion of the sonic manifestation of Ïabda hence to a centrifugalsonic force and an otherwise latent power of sound....

Science of Mantrasplanet also produces a roaring sound of intensity proportional to itshuge size. The superimposition of these planetary roars gives rise tothe cosmic sound – a manifestation of Ïabda – which the scientistsconsider as the major source of power for every kind of ‘naturalmotion’ existing in the entire universe.The power of Ïabda manifests itself in multiple ways in the s³dhan³of the great G³yatrº Mantra. This mantra is a compilation of twenty-four special syllables/words (in Sanskrit) which are so configuredthat the enunciation of each gives rise to unique types of vibrations atone or more of the twenty-four important bio-electrical and extrasen-sory energy nuclei in the s³dhaka’s body. The collective compoundedsonic effects of all of these are so unique and immense that theseactivate the subtle body too.The linguistic meaning of this mantra is a universal prayer for thedivine illumination of the intellect of all to lead the world towards therighteous path..... The s³dhaka’s mental concentration and puresentiments are naturally focussed around this meaning (and the asso-ciated feelings and inspirations) when he performs japa of this man-tra through emotional depths. This has two prominent effects – viz.,the s³dhak’s mind achieves higher state of meditation and he alsoattains spiritual refinement of the inner domains of mind.The complete effect of the japa of the G³yatrº Mantra with trueïraddh³ also purifies the astral body of the s³dhaka and illumi-nates all facets of his life with a divine glow. Liberation from the evileffects of misdeeds and sins of the past life or previous births arenatural bequests of the successful s³dhan³ of this mantra. On worldlyfronts, the s³dhaka lives a truly happy and progressive life and alsocontributes significantly – without any ego, selfish interest or worldlyattachment – towards multidimensional welfare of others.The dhiya¡ element of the G³yatrº Mantra induces the cosmic vi-brations of Ïabda and the sonic waves generated by the japa of thismantra traverse through the infinity of Brahm³ñÃa47.

The s³dhaka’s mind consistentlyreceives the supernormal impulses and sparks of divine force and, asa result, often attains extrasensory knowledge and supramental pow-ers via dreams, intuitions and sudden inspirations.... The s³dhakaalso experiences ‘hearing of mysterious sounds...’, ‘vision the distantand otherwise unseen places and objects’, ‘flashes of supernaturallight’, ...... etc.As stated earlier, the mantras, by definition, are sublime carriers ofthe power of Ïabda indwelling in sound, thoughts and emotions. Thesonic as well as the emotional energy together make a mantra alive.While the observance of prescribed elementary disciplines – like, regu-larity of timings and the number and pace of japas...., etc – is a mustto generate appropriate sonic vibrations from the japa of a mantra,the unperturbed engrossment of mind with deep faith and emotionallinkage with the devat³ of the mantra – is necessary for awakeningthe subliminal force of Ïabda in it.It may be noted again that for the success of the s³dhan³ of anymantra, it is the piety of character and deeds, the strength and stabil-ity of mind and the ïraddh³ – that are the most crucial and importantvirtues of the s³dhaka rather than his intellectual eminence or scho-lastic expertise in the vedic scriptures...., etc.Anybody who sincerely adopts the principle of truth, creativity andaltruist service with compassion, generosity and love and who en-deavors self-restrain for escalating march towards self-refinementwould qualify to commence G³yatrº S³dhan³ under the intimateguidance of a noble guru.

Science of MantrasPsychological Basis of the Effects of JapaMantra-Japa is affirmed by the sages as a powerful mechanism forintensifying the willpower and self-determination. It can thus be regardedas a procedure for strengthening self-control and psychological improve-ment along with the development of vigorous and virtuous personality.The human mind at the conscious and the subconscious levels is anensemble of uncountably many thoughts and emotions of varied qual-ity, stability and impact. Those generated by internal desire or mentalresolution or existing because of assimilated samsk³ras48 are moreintense and cannot be waned out or refined easily. These ratherstable thoughts and emotions, if belonging to the evil (or not suit-able to the human- dignity) category, cause maximum disturbancesand obstructions during meditation. Japa helps controlling such per-turbations because japa is an activity that engages the major facul-ties of mind with a natural harmony and ‘tunes’ them coherently withthe rhythm and vibrations of the mantra being enunciated or chanted.The faith and ïraddh³ in the mantra add to the positive effects ofjapa, as they provide a moral support, an emotional linkage and hencean inner courage and subliminal energy to enable the s³dhaka struggleand diminish the evil instincts and thoughts. It is a principle of psy-chology that – if a certain thought, lesson or imagination is often re-peated before one’s mind, the latter begins to grasp and assimilate thesame in the deeper layers of its memory. These thoughts, imagina-tions or feelings then appear to be ‘true’ to the learner’s mind andmay eventually become a part of his nature and belief.The small mantras like – Oa® Hari Oa®; or, Hari Oa® Tat Sat; or, Soah®...etc, or the thy – names such as – Sri Ram or All³ha....., etc, are like compactformulae or symbols in short-hand scripts to represent and remind of divinityand divine principles and disciplines. The repeated japa of such mantrasor names would naturally (according to the psychological theories ofstimulus-response), intensify the divine faith and serene, moral charac-teristics in the s³dhaka’s mind. ‘How fast such effects would be real-ized?’ – this largely depends upon the desire (purpose), the willpowerand the intrinsic urge with which the japa is being performed."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125Eternity...

The dif-ference between such responses and the effects of mantra-japashould however be well understood here. Mantra-japa is an spiri-tual exercise aimed at the main purpose of the spiritual elevation ofthe s³dhaka. This also has subtle effects on the inner self along withthe aforesaid psychological effects of recalling and retention.... Theseresults may appear meek initially and seem to occur at a slow pacebut are definite, gradually augmenting and everlasting if the japa isperformed sincerely and regularly.Japa has been uniformly regarded in almost all the religions or schoolsof philosophy across the globe as an important spiritual activity or anessential requirement for spiritual enlightenment. The scriptures onIndian philosophy and spiritual sciences focus a great deal on thepsychological significance of mantra-japa as well.

This mantra is also special in termsof its unique sonic pattern, the sublime flow of Ïabda and astonishingphysical, psychological and spiritual impacts.The process of mantra-japa smoothly encompasses the followingfour aspects of training and improvement of the mind as describedthe modern psychologists. Namely –– (i) memorizing by repetition;(ii) retention and recalling; (iii) learning by experience and (iv) believ-ing by conviction.

Science of MantrasAcoustics and Mantra Vijó³naDuring the war times in the ancient era, the generals used to inferabout the location of the enemy’s army by keeping an ear on theearth’s surface and thereby ‘sensing’ the sound of its movements.This example indicates that although sound is supposed to be spread-ing and being heard via the medium of air, its vibrations, if amplified,can also be perceived by the earth.In the human body, the audible vibrations of sound, when make colli-sion with the ear’s diaphragm, they create specific impulse in thelatter’s connection with the brain and thus the corresponding sound isheard. Many animals and birds have latent communication- sensorsin their bodies via which they can receive (‘hear’) subtle sonic sig-nals from much longer distances than those falling in the audible rangeof the human ears. The ‘prior sensing’ of rainfall by the peacocksprovokes them to dancing; spiders begin to unwind and recollect theirmeshes on the similar occasions...; cats take their kittens away fromthe building which is likely to fall in near future....The human beings can receive and hear some of the non-audiblesounds with the help of hi-tech devices. The early development ofthese types of sonic-sensors and related instruments included that ofa device made up of two mica tubes filled with mercury. The base ofthis instrument used to be buried to sense the vibrations inside theearth in order to record the movements of the enemy’s army duringthe Second World War. This device used to register the ‘sound’ ofthe army’s movements much the same way as stethoscope recordsthe sound of the heartbeats....

Science of Mantraswaves via electrical or electronic signals) has made it possible for themodern scientists to record a large number of distant and subtle vi-brations inside or upon the earth, beneath deep oceans or in the spaceabove the earth’s atmosphere. The ultimate stage of such advanceddevelopments should help the scientists realize that – every element,the subtlest particle of every entity existing in this universe is createdby the vibrations of Ïabda; or, in other words, the whole universe andcosmos is a manifestation of the Ïabda Brah®. The iÌis – thescientists of N³da Yoga and Ïabda Yoga had achieved this level ofultimate knowledge and therefore ‘devised’ the mantras and themethods (japa s³dhan³s) of their use in the physical (gross), psy-chological and spiritual development of men and women. What theyhad achieved in addition – by the dhy³na yoga (meditating s³dhan³)– was, the expertise to link the subtlest power of light with that of thesound existing in the mantras.Specific japa-s³dhan³ of a specific mantra by a spiritually refinedperson is indeed a unique experiment in acoustics where the powerof sound is utilized beyond the limits of material existence. When aharmonium or piano is played, pressing specific keys (that producedifferent accents or musical notes) repeatedly in an orderly mannergenerates specific musical tune.... Similarly, japa is a process in whichspecific components of the mouth, the vocal-cord and the connectingnerves produce desired sonic patterns that harmoniously vibrate the‘keys’ of the extrasensory ‘wires’ (e.g. the iÃ³, pingal³, suÌumn³n³Ãºs....) and the subtle ‘energy bundles’ (e.g. the Ìat cakras....)inside the body. The latter, being stimulated further by the subliminalenergy and flow of the consciousness of the s³dhaka, produce su-pernatural effects – via the associated currents of Ïabda – specificto the type and purpose of the s³dhan³.The immediate and necessary indication of the success of a mantra-s³dhan³ is the refinement, improvement and illumination of thes³dhaka’s overall personality and his deeds.

The engineering, physical andbiological sciences largely focus on the structure and function of dif-ferent kinds and forms of matter and aim at deciphering the universallaws governing these. The applications developed thereby are there-fore suitable only for material forms and mediums – at micro or macrolevels – including such components inside the living bodies.The spiritual sciences focus on the existence and expression of theother, the subliminal and more important half of Life and Nature, namely– the mind and the inner cores of consciousness. Mantras are themeans for experimental studies and applications in the science ofconsciousness and spirituality.

One branchof this science focuses on the thoughts, emotions, beliefs and innersentiments like faith and ïraddh³ and the other on the external do-mains of jó³na –– knowledge about the universe and the universalself, and karma49 in the Brahm³ñÃa. All the experiments – likeyoga, tapasy³, s³dhan³... etc – of spiritual sciences are based onthe theory of jó³na and the practicing of karma.The individual consciousness is a reflection of the omnipresent Su-preme Consciousness. There is no life in the body without the indi-vidual consciousness. The expression of the individual self as a beingis also governed by this eternal source – the individual consciousness.Strengthening of this ‘vital spiritual force’ of life is possible only byactivating its subtle linkage with the omnipresent, eternal, SupremeConsciousness. Mantra-s³dhan³s are indeed the scientific experi-ments designed for this purpose. Such experiments – on stimulatingthe sublime powers of the individual self, are analogous to the pro-cesses of recharging of electrical power generators to enable theconnecting device function efficiently.Regular consumption of oxygen, water and food is essential for thehealthy sustenance of a living body. The strength and health of thevery source of its life – the individual consciousness – similarly needsa constant energizing of its sublime linkage with the divine conscious-ness.

Sincere attempts and determinedpursuit for inculcation of these virtues is an integral part of all spiritualendeavors including the Mantra S³dhan³s.Different kinds of Yama-Niyama (yoga disciplines) and training prac-tices are prescribed as essential lessons in the elementary phase ofMantra Vidy³. The most important and common yama-niyamainclude – Brahmacarya; self-restrain over the tongue with respectto speech as well as eating habits; sincere attempts to abate the egoand selfish desires; creativity, active participation/contribution in so-cial service with serene sentiments of love and compassion, respectfor others, etc.Thorough control over speech and thoughts, use of affectionate andrespectful language in day-to-day conversation, practices of phonet-ics and music for proper pronunciation and for consistency of ac-cents, rhythm, amplitude, and simple (elementary) exercises of N³daYoga and Ïabda Yoga provide substantial support in refining theBaikhari and the Madhyam³ V³ñºs.

Ïraddh³ and faith in the power of a mantra addspecific force of consciousness in its s³dhaka and thus activate hisv³ñº with the consonant energy of Ïabda.The role of v³ñº is more obvious in the process of mantra-japa andso is the relation between sound and mantras. The realization of thepower of sound has led to the advanced scientific developments ofinfrasonic to ultra- and supersonic applications in the present times.Noting that – the functional power of a mantra largely resides in itssonic configuration, it should be possible by scientific developments inrelated areas to use the suprasonic power of mantras and invent theconstructive applications that appear ‘unimaginable’ today....Our universe is a limitless ‘ocean’ of continuous flow of infinitelymany energy-waves, of which, only a few – namely, the audible andthe ultra and infra sound waves; ultra violet and infrared light rays; X-rays, Gamma rays, Lasers, Microwaves etc – have been discoveredand utilized via the modern scientific research. The wavelengths50of these waves measure in a wide range –– from angstroms, micronsand millimeters to centimeters and meters. The frequency (vibra-tions) and hence the energy and properties – of these waves alsodiffer drastically.The properties of ‘physical sound’ have significant relation with thefive basic elements (panca tatvas) of Nature’s manifestation. Forinstance, the velocity (in ft/sec) of the sound waves propagated alongthe flow of air is about 1088; along the flow of water is about 4900;and along the vibrations in the earth is about 16400. The essentialpractices and rituals of Pr³ñ³y³ma, Arghd³na, Dºpa-Dh¿pa andHavan – often prescribed along with the mantra-s³dhan³s – areindeed associated with the conditioning of mind for soothing effectsof the sonic powers of the basic elements of air (v³yu), water (jala),earth (pathvº) and sun, fire and heat (agni).Our ears and the mouth (and the vocal- cord) play very importantrole in hearing and pronunciation of a wide variety of sounds and aretherefore of significant importance in the experiments of N³da Yoga"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141Eternity...

So efficient is their connection with the brain that, for ablind person, the ears also work like the eyes – a blind person canrecognize different objects by sensing the latter’s sound (vibrations).The relation of mind with the functioning of the ears is equally re-markable. At times, in absent-minded states or because of the disin-terest or indifference of our mind, we do not really hear – what theperson sitting next to us is telling...! Whereas murmuring at somedistant place can also be heard by us if our mind keenly concentratesthere.... Such familiar experiences clearly explain the need of mentalconcentration and meditation during mantra-japa and other exer-cises of the Ïabda and N³da– Yogas.The importance of m³nasika-japa also is obvious in the above con-text. Although, a mantra is enunciated only mentally in this practiceof Ïabda Yoga, its (the mantra’s) vibrations are well received in theconnecting sensors of the tongue and the ears and are hence regis-tered in the brain as per its sonic pattern and the ‘mental signals’ ofits s³dhaka.In the s³dhan³s of N³da Yoga, the ears are trained by deep medita-tion and willpower to grasp the otherwise non-audible sounds existingin the cosmic expansion. By such practices, the s³dhaka, while per-forming the mansika-japa of a mantra, can hear (link his mind with)the subliminal sound of this mantra and can thereby attract the corre-sponding energy-currents of the omnipresent Ïabda.

Science of MantrasScientific Roots of the Divine Impact of Mantra S³dhan³That sound can be recorded (e.g., by tape-recorders), amplified (e.g.,by loudspeakers), propagated (e.g., by radio and TV signals), recog-nized (e.g., by the radar), measured and analyzed (e.g., by spectro-graphs or voice-printers) –– in physical terms, proves its existence inmatter.... A large number of examples of the destructive and creativeeffects of sound on matter can also be found in day-to-day life (c.f.previous sections).Mantra Vidy³ is based on making perfect use of the gross viz., thesound of the v³ñº of the s³dhaka as well as the sublime viz., theconsciousness –– the voice of the inner self, expressed in thoughts,emotions and intrinsic strength of the s³dhaka, powers of Ïabda.The study of the higher level impact of mantras vis-à-vis that of thephysical sound – in the gross domains of Nature, seems feasible inthe modern times of scientific advancement.The mechanical devices of radar send sound signals – via radio waves– far away in the space and receive the echoed sound back in fewmicro (10-6) seconds. The radio waves travel at a speed of about295000 kilometers per second. Whenever their collision takes placewith any object on their way, these waves are reflected back (to theradar that is set ‘tuned’ to receive them) at equally fast speed. Thevibrations of these reflected signals contain the ‘information’ aboutthe position, size and some other properties of the object. (This ishow sound waves help in the recognition – through the radar, of anenemy’s airplane during the war times....).The human body could also be regarded as a ‘radar’ with respect tothe gross sonic effects of the mantras. The extrasensory inner com-ponents (like the ÌaÚ cakras or the granthis.... etc) of this biologicalradar send supernormal radio signals in the ‘etheric whole’ via thevibrations of mantras being enunciated in specific rhythms....

Science of MantrasThe latent power of Ïabda – linked with the spiritual enlightenmentand hence with the awakened power of the eternal consciousness ofthe soul of the s³dhaka effectuates the impact of mantras on the‘radar’ of the s³dhaka’s physical, subtle and astral bodies.

The ultrasonic research findings of a French scien-tist, Dr. Leisswin, were successfully used for the first time in 1914 forrecognition of underwater objects (like submarines) during the FirstWorld War. There has been a significant progress in the applicationsof ultrasound in the twentieth century. Drs. U. Adala, D. Hertz andDr. Hughes etc. had successfully used this form of sound for prelimi-nary applications in the field of medicine during 1942–1950. Today,the medical technology is making tremendous use of advanced ultra-sonic devices for noninvasive diagnostic purposes and for delicatesurgical operations.The effects of mantra are based on subtler levels of sound than theultra- or infra- sounds. The body components like the tongue and thepalate are supporting tools for augmenting the frequency of the soundof the syllables of mantra. The inner extrasensory energy-centers ofthe body (including those in the brain) exponentially amplify – withthe help of the vital power of the bio-electricity and the strength ofconsciousness (of the s³dhaka), the frequency of the sound waves ofthe mantra far beyond the limits of ultrasonic and supersonic vibrations.Scientific investigations on mantra vidy³ are necessary consideringthe fact that only a handful of genuine ‘experts’ of this latent field ofknowledge could be available today. Many ‘so called’ religious andspiritual ‘masters’ have been making a mockery of this great scienceby false propaganda and superstitious proclamations since the medi-eval era of moral, cultural and social decline.Every scientifically liberated mind should realize that –– mantra-japainvolves subliminal powers of sound, experiment on which demand"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145Eternity...

The effect ofa mantra is mostly spiritual in nature. Research in the science ofmantras therefore cannot be independent of the science of deeperpsychology and spirituality.Laboratory experiments on ultrasonic effects have shown that thevibrations at a high frequency – of the order of five crores per second– can produce so much energy that would covert the surroundingmaterial into vapors and ashes almost instantaneously. Then whatabout the power of the vibrations that are generated at exponentiallyfaster frequencies by a controlled use of bio-electricity, vital energyand the sublime force of the otherwise unused (latent) part of thehuman-consciousness? Why wouldn’t they induce suprasonic im-pulses in the etheric whole and create cosmic effects?For a systematic and detailed analysis of the above aspects of man-tra-vidy³, a comprehensive study of the scriptures on yoga s³dhan³swould be inevitable. The ‘visualization’ (realization) of the seventy-two thousands n³Ãºs, mysterious bundles of nerves and muscles(uptyik³s) and the extrasensory knots (granthis) and energy pools(cakras) along the spinal column and the brah® randhras in thebrain – by specific s³dha³s of Ïabda Yoga and N³da Yoga, wouldbe a promising method for thorough experimental investigations inthis regard.The psychological effects of mantra- japa are far more importantthan its sonic effects. The t³ntrika part of mantra vidy³ describesthe tongue as Shakti (the Goddess Parvati) and the heart as the GodShiva. These are also termed as Rayi and Pr³ña or Agni and Soma.These two represent the eternal and mutually complementary sub-liminal currents of cosmic pr³ña, the confluence of which is sup-posed to be the soruce of existence and evolution of everything in thisworld....The connection between the positively and negatively charged elec-trodes makes a complete circuit for the flow of electrical current.Similarly, though subliminally, the arousal of Shakti by japa (through"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146Eternity... Science of Mantrasthe tongue) and the realization of Shiva by the intrinsic force ofïraddh³ (educed in the emotional core/heart) during a mantra-s³dhan³ generate a ‘current’ of the hidden force of Ïabda. Thelatter, being empowered by the eternal consciousness induces super-natural sonic effects and inculcates immortal beatific impressions inthe subconscious, unconscious and super conscious domains of themind.Âch³rya Vinoba Bhave, an ardent disciple of Mahatma Gandhi andthe founder of the Sarvodaya Mission used to regard the process ofspeaking as a mode of worshiping the v³ñº. He had accordingly re-strained and refined this faculty so well, that every word uttered byhim was like a ‘japa’. This is why, his short but inspiring speechused to lay magical effects on the audience. It was this power of hisrefined v³ñº that had made his Bh¿d³na project a real success.....A quote in Shatpath Brahmana mentions that the words or speechwhich can eliminate the evils from the minds of all people and whichcan inspire the human society towards the righteous path – are truemantras of Saraswatiº (– the deity of pure knowledge and intelli-gence). Thus, as far as the psychological impacts are concerned, anykind of speech or conversation, which is originated by altruist senti-ments and intrinsic urge towards the true welfare of all, can be effec-tive like a mantra.The creative and enchanting impacts of music on human-psychologyare well accepted today and interdisciplinary scientific research isquite active to make use of the same against psychological disordersand as a ‘tonic’ for mental health and enthusiasm for those engagedin monotonic laborious works.
