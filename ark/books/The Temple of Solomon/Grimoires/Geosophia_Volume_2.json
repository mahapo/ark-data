For example, various Greek scholars saidof the Thracians that they worshipped three deities, Artemis, Dionysusand Ares, who are of course all Greek deities. This is all rhe more prob-lematic since a good many Greek gods came from elsewhere in the firstplace. The myths of the origin of Cybele and the supposedly castrated godAttis arelargely Greek; even though the deities concerned are not.In recent studies of the Thracians the necess ity of puffing aside old as-sumptions and frnding the Thracian interpretation has been powerfullyunderlined. Applying this barbarian interpretation ro rhe Greeks, in re-versal of the Greek habit, may appear a little strange. This is not really thecase, for two very cogent reasons. The first is that the Thracians, and oth-er'barbariansl were an extremely important infuence on Greek religion,particularly the aspects of it directly relevant to this study. The second isthat many urbanised and literate Greeks in the Classical and Hellenisticeras were moving away from the state cults. In consequence, the olderstrata of Greek religion, and supposedly backward areas of their own cul-ture, underwent a tremendous renaissance. Both had more in commonwith'barbarian rather than Classical Greek ideas and practices. WhileDionysus was not a foreign god, and Orphism is more likely to have be-gun in Southern Italy, both cults consciously adopted Thracian modfsand rites. An interpretation based on Thracian, Scythian or Pelasgianmotifs therefore has numerous advanrages, nor least being a useful bal-ance to the employment of classicalliterary sources."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The key role of Thrace in this study is exemplified by several ele-ments indicated already: the selection of hierophants for the EleusianMysteries from the Eumolpidx,, aThracian familf; the similar primacyof the Thracidr family at Delphi; the Thracian infuences on the cults ofDionysus and Orpheus; the Mysteries of Samothrace and Lemnos on theThracian coast. Of nearly equal importance is the role of Phrygia, its cultof the Mother, and the Thracian element in its civilisation.The Classical Greeks tended to portray the Thracians as bloodthirstybarbarians. While they were cenain\\y great warriors, this estimation can-not be taken at face value. Homer's account of the Trojan War accuratelyportrays the Thracians as at least equal in cultural advancement to theirallies the Trojans, and their enemies the Achaean Greeks. Archaeologysupporrs this literary evidence, with extraordinarily rich 6nds in Thracianroyaltombs. These include the earliest gold artefacts in Europe, horse har-ness trappings dated rc 35oo scp and Bronze Age gold bowls from tombburials of r3oo ecp. At the time of the Mycenaean civilisation, and thatof the Minoans before them, Thrace was a strong and impressive power.By rzoo BCE, the Mycenaean civilisation of Greece was imploding, butThracian tribes were expanding into Asia Minor to found the kingdom ofPhrygia. In ro5o BCE, the Minoan civilisation in Crete was expiring, andmainland Greece was gripped in a Dark Age, but Phrygia defeated and re-placed the Hittites.In south eastern Thrace an advanced and powerful civ-ilisation fourished from the I2'h to 6'h centuries BcE, and Thrace as a wholecontinued to prosper from then until the beginning of the 3'd century.Thrace then was one of the most powerful and populous nations ofthe ancient world. It constituted a major infuence on Greek culture, par-ticularly in relation to religion. This infuence was, and still is, a difficultsubject to assess precisely. The dominant place Greek and Roman studiespossessed in early modern historical thinking impeded Thracian studiesuntil comparativeLy recently. The fact that Thrace was a culture with anoral rather than written tradition of its own only compounded this ne-glect, This situation has begun to improve in the post war period, andparticularly since the I97os. Even so, this may be the 6rst attempt to assessthe Thracians role in the history of Western magic."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTERPRETATIONSuch a first has implied limitations, but at the same time is too overdueto be neglected. While the majority of studies are unfortunately nor inEnglish, Thracology is inestimably more important - to understanding an-cient and advancing modern Western occultism - than either Egyprologyor the Kabbalah. These are bold words, fouting what'everybody knows'in favour of something unfamiliar. But it is unfamiliar for all the wrongreasons. The old certainties of classicism have not been questioned by oc-cultists: unhistorical fantasies have been perpetuated in favour of blindtraditionalism, or sidestepped in favour of arootless solipsism. Hence mydeconstruction of the old classical picture, itself partly unfamiliar, is anuphill struggle. Regardless of these difficulties, rhe necessity for such anendeavour is plain enough.Since Phrygia (located in modern Tirrkey) plays a substantial part inwhat follows, it is as well to relate a little concerning it. Its exrenr was var-ied in different periods, and to some degree the name has a generaLsignifi-cance. F{omer locates the Phrygians on the banks of the river Sangarius;here according to other writers, and substantiated by archaeology, werethe kingdoms of Midas and Gordius. Under the Romans, Phrygia lay be-tween Mysia and Lydia ro the West; Galatia, formerly part of Phrygia,to the East; and Bithynia to the North. Thracian colonists tradition-ally called the Bryges, from which the name of Phrygia was corrupted,anciently settled the territory. Further waves of Thracian tribes drovethem inland, though significant communities remained in the coastal re-gions between the Hellepont and Propontis, and the mountains knownas Ida and Olympus. Here they were in the closest conract with IonianGreek colonies. At various times the region formed part of the Persian,Macedonian, Alexandrian successor and Roman empires. Phrygias mosrfamous city was Troy, from which the area bears the name of the toad.The Phrygians played a significant and important parr in the develop-ment of Greek culture. Greek music for example, especially fute music,was acquired in part from Phrygia. In addition, the region was closelyassociated in the Greek mind with the rites of Dionysus or Bacchus, andthose of Cybe\\e, Mother of the Gods."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The HeroClassical literary accounts of the religion and magic of the Thracians gen-eralIy tend to involve strongly Greek interpretations. There was of coursemutual infuence between the two, and some adoption of Greek formsby the Thracians is undeniable. Similarly the Roman conquest of Thracehas left a substantial mark on the later monuments and other archaeo-logical remains relevant to Thracian religion. Useful though some of thesesurvivals are when carefully considered, they are very far from being thewhole picture.Towering above these in significance is a less familiar figure, a divinehero on horseback, of whom no less than three thousand representationsare known in the region of ancient Thrace. This 6gure is of the utmostimportance to understanding not only Thracian but older Greek religionand magic. He has no known name, as the Thracians were extremely reti'cent about the names of their deities.In addition it is more than likely thatany name he may have possessed would have varied from region to region.Where inscriptions exist in later representations he is identified simply asHero, or the god Hero. From this and other indications it is certain no sim-ple mortal warrior is intended by these titles. Although the iconographyof the divine rider is influenced by Greek forms, the Hero himself is farmore ancient, and pivotal to this entire study.The god Hero is a complex figure, far more so in many respects thanthe deities of Classical Greece. However, even though representations ofthe Hero pofiray various phases of his myth, the same character is alwaysreadily identifiable. His iconography is incredibly consistent, while at thesame time the dedicatory inscriptions involve an extremely varied range offunctions. His nature plainly involves many roles, in contrast to the highlydifferentiated Greek gods of the Classical period.Often his versatility is signified by depicting the Hero with three heads.This may be important when interpreting Hellenistic figures, includingthose in Italy.In Roman times particular functions are emphasised by su-perimposing elements specific to the appropriate Greek or Roman god.Sometimes this represents the particular function of Hero being appealed"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE BARBARIAN INTERPRETATIONto. On other images it can indicate a quality or feature of his cult mostpopular in a given region. Even with these superimposed atrributes thefamiliar Thracian iconography is retained. On all occasions his Thracianidentity, and thus his intrinsic universaliry, is never truly in question.Beginning by simplifying the Hero a little, in advance of what is ro fol-low; two principal conrrasting modes can be distinguished. These are thesolar and chthonic modes, which in Graco-Roman rerms are principallyrepresented by Apollo on rhe one hand and Dionysus or Dis on the other.A god possessing two such contrasting modes is very rare in the specialis-ing Olympian religion; with the principal exceptions of Hermes, and ofDionysus. Dionysus was one of three deities identified as Thracian amongthe Greeks, and his martial achievements in conquering India should notbe forgotten in preference for his more orgiastic and fructifying narure.In effect the combination of roles of the hero as ancesror of the tribe,as well as its protector and champion explains the Greek perception ofDionysus and Ares being chief male deides among the Thracians.In orderto become a ma\\e ancestor of course there had to be a moth er, the divinemother and lover of the hero, whom the Greeks principally identified wirhArtemis.T-he Great Motber of the GodsIn Greek myth the Great Mother of the Gods is the Cretan Earth GoddessRhea. She was the source of fruitfulness in the kingdoms of man, beasrand vegetation. Hesiod says of her that she was rhe daughter of Uranusand Gaia or Ge, which is to say of Heaven and Earth. She is also the wifeof the god Kronos, and the mother of the majority of the Olympian godsrHestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. Kronos anticipatedhis own overthrow by one of his children, and accordingly devoured themas soon they were born. For this reason Rhea, when on the point of giv-ing birth to Zeus, took refuge at Lycrus in Crete, andwhen he was safelydelivered gave Kronos a stone in his pIace. Homer largely agrees withthis account, although he names only the three great sons of Rhea, Zeus,Poseidon and Hades, who divided the world between them."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Hesiod's account corrcctly identifies Rhea as a Cretan goddess whoseworship spread throughout the Greek world, and of particular impor-tance, to Asia Minor. There she was identified with the Great Goddess ofthe Phrygians, the goddess Cybele. This identification is of crucial impor-tance in understanding Greek myth from the perspective of the'barbar-ian interpretationi the key to understanding its origins and much of itsunderlying meaning. The particular significance of the identification ofCybele and Rhea is undoubtedly that it identifies the Phrygian goddesswith the mother of Zeus.Since Cybele is also the mother of the Phrygiankings her relationship with him underpins the link between kingshipand the divine. Exactly the same relationship, of son and lover, applies toThracian kings and the royal cult. The relations of the goddess with bothMidas and his son Attis is of the nature of a Phrygian dynastic cult onthe Thracian model. That in the Greek legend she is fertilised 6y Zeas, ofwhom she is also the mother, is probably explained by the same formula.Whatever the nature of the Cretan goddess, the identification withPhrygian Cybele, who for our purposes is indistinguishable from thegreat Goddess of the Thracians, lent to her cult its orgiastic characterHer domain was the mountains and forests, and her attendants were thelions and panthers who dwelled there. She is the Mountain Mother andthe Mistress of Beasts. Her link with Dionysus, and with other gods ofmoisture and fruitfulness, is present throughout the Mystery cults exam-ined in this study. In great part Dionysian wildness is the inheritance ofhis relationship with the Mother of the Gods.While scholars insist that the Great Mother of the Gods is a conceptof Eastern origin this does not detract from her importance at deep levelsof Greek Mystery religion. It does however reinforce the significance ofThracian and Phrygian infuence upon it. Significantly while the earliestfemale idols in Thracian territory are single alarcr stage comes of doubleimages, one inside the other, as found at Orsoya. The simplest explanationof this is of Mother and Daughter, corresponding to Demeter and Koreor Persephone. That these deities were associated with Thracian influ-ence at Eleusis is not accidental. A few centuries later comes a third kindof image, suggesting the Mother and Daughter have been joined by a son."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTERPRETATIONThe necessity of a son, as part of the morher in ancient theology, is that hedoes not detract from her omniporence. This relationship may be seen inthe case of Cybele and Attis as well as Persephone and Dionysus. This sonand lover is clearly identified in Thracian arr as the Hero.The Daughter - herself a projection of the Mother - represents theferttle virgin with whom the hero is partnered in rhe heiros gamos. Theorphic conception of Zeus fathering Dionysus upon Persephone derivesfrom this background. The abduction of Persephone by Hades carcied asimilar meaning. An important myth with a similar theme involves Zeusin the form of a serpent impregnatingRhea with Demeter; rhen Demeterwith Persephone, who in turn produces Dionysus.In Orphic understand-ing the goddess, (Rhea-Demeter-Persephone) was the protagonist of thistriple union. According to Orphic Fragment r45 Rhea became Demerer asthe mother of Zeus, who in turn fathers Persephone on her. It conrinuesthat she was destined to bear Dionysus ro Zeus, and that the son wouldrule after him as the ultimate ruler of the gods. The Neoplatonists rea-sonably concluded from this that Rhea, Demeter and Persephone wereultimately one, and so were Zeus, Hades and Dionysus.These were deep Mysteries, and it is not for a momenr suggested rheyformed part of the daily concerns of religious life for the average Greek.Their significance is fundamentally esoteric, for those whose inner re-sponse to the numinous is on an altogether more intense level,BendisA Thracian goddess who certainly infuenced the Greeks in the hisrori-cal period was the goddess Bendis. The Greeks identified her with bothArtemis and Hecate rhrough her associarions with the Moon and withhunting, Plato makes mention of the mounred torch race thar formed aspectacular part of the nocturnal celebrations of her cult. As wirh Artemis(whose temple at Ephesus had major connecrion with the cult of Cybele)the role of hunting goddess derives from the extremely ancient cult ofPotnia Theron - Mistress of Beasts - that was part of the background ofCybele.It should be noted that rhe connecrion of Artemis with the Moon"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"is a late development as is the connection of Apollo with the Sun. The realbasis for the ancient identification of Artemis with Bendis - as with thegreat goddess of Asia Minor - was the connection with streams, forestsand the animal kingdom.CotysAnother Thracian goddess who influenced the Greeks was Cotys orCotytto. The Greeks compared her with Persephone and with Demeter;her rites - the Cotyttia - were deemed Dionysian and frowned on by theconservative elite of Athens. Her rites were notorious for debauchery;be-ing celebrated with music and dance. As well as in Athens they were alsoestablished in Sicily, where we know that her worshippers carried greenboughs hung with cakes and fruit that anyone was permitted to pluck.Interestingly enough they were also accepted in Corinth.Hieros Gamos and DeiJtcationThe roots of sexual mysticism in the Western tradition do not origi-nate in the Tantric tradition of India. Nor, although they are linked withGnosticism, does it originate within that diverse flowering of late paganphilosophy and religious syncretism. The origins of sexual symbolism andritual in Western magic lay firmly in the Thracian mysteries; particularlyin the rites of deification of Thracian kings in their sacred marriage to theMother of the Gods. This was perceived as a match of the initiated dynast- who personifred the hero * with the virgin daughter, a hypostasis of theMother herself. This occurred within the life of the king upon earth, andwas symbolised in various ways, Among these was a sexual interpretationof ritual acts such as libation, as well as royal marriages. There is a famousstory of king Kotys I, arcanging a marriage feast for the goddess Athenaand then awaiting her in the bridal chamber. This exemplifies ritual mar-riage between king and goddess in the context of the Thracian dynasticcult. So too it demonstrates how'barbafian'understanding of Greek tra-ditions retained meaning and context lost in tivilised' Greece."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE BARBARIAN INTERPRETATIONUpon death the identificadon of the king with the chthonic aspect of thehero became complete. Aspects of burial rites show a clear sexual symbol-ism. Examples of this symbolism are known to and recognised by archae-ology; interments face down with legs splayed, or face up with an ironploughshare upon the groin. Both of these methods of intermenr symbol-ise union of the dynast with the Earth goddess. This symbolism may aisobe implicit in the ploughing of the field of Ares byJason in Colchis; therethe ploughshare is a gift of Hephasrus ro the king. So too, as will be seen,Jason's marriage to Medea is replete with connections with the mysteriesof Dionysus.This sexual union in death is largely absent from myth for an excel-lent reason, it is a Mystery. Although a secrer of the Mystery religions,which it was forbidden to reveal, it is nevertheless nor concealed entirely.As already mentioned Cybele was identified with Rhea and, through realor perceived ancient links between Phrygian and Cretan mysteries, theyshared common origins. Rhea was the wife of Kronos and rhe motherof his children. In particular the rulers of the three worlds: Sky, Sea andL]nderworld; Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. It is now rime to consider theirfather.KronosAs the role of Kronos as the cruel father of the gods has been mentioned,it is time to examine other apparendy contradictory aspecrs of the god.He was the youngest of the Titans, son of the earrh goddess Gaia, and thesky god Ouranos who he famously castrated with a sickle.It was from himalso, impotantly, that the infanr Zeus was hidden in Crete. Accordingto this myth, Zess subsequently imprisoned him in Tartarus. Anotheraspect of his mythology appears to be at vanance with this, although laterversions attempr ro reconcile the two by changing his place of incarcera-tion.His rule over the more favoured parts of the afterlife is the central as-pect of the other side of his myth, Far from being a tyrant as portrayedin the myth of the infant Zeus,he is portrayed as the ruler of the Golden"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Age, the first age of man. Men then lived and feasted like the gods. Lightof heart, neither grief , sickness nor old age touched them and the earthgave free\\y of her bounty without labour. This rule is mirrored in the af-terllfe, where Kronos rules over Elysium or the Islands of the Blessed.Puzzled by the contrast, some writers have endeavoured to seParate thetwo themes, claiming the benign version is authentically Indo-EuroPean,and the cruel ryrant form originates elsewhere. There are in fact similarHurrian-Hittite legends, supposed to have infuenced Hesiod in his ac-count of the events. However, Hesiod - whose cosmogony is otherwiseconsistent and logical - mentions both asPects of the myth. Similarly,both sides of the god are present in important rituals. The contradictions,in other words, are an essential part of the god's nature.One such rite, the Athenian Kronia, which is similar to the better-known Roman Saturnalia, occurred after the harvest. Normal social dis-tinctions were remporarily put aside; masters and slaves feasted together,some accounts even record masters serving the slaves. On the other hand,he is frequently associated with horrific crimes and cult practices. Not allof these are likely to have been real events, but rather a portrayal of his na-ture. Similarly, foreign deities, in whose cults such Practices were teal, areconsisrenrly identified with him. There may indeed have been influencesfrom Asia Minor and from older cultures, but essentially these contradic-tions refr,ect the real natufe of the god. In essence, Kronos embodies pe-riods of transition where normality is suspended. These are portrayed inimagery and real events ofjoyous exaltation on the one hand, and ghastlytales of fearful cruelty on the other.His Roman form, Saturn, emphasises the benign asPect of the god.While the Hellenistic Greeks came to connect chronis, time, with the godKronos the Romans quite separately connected Saturn with calendars,seasonal events and their feast days. Further indeed, both Saturn and Marsenjoyed higher status and more frequent and prominent cult among theRomans than did their Greek equivalents. This, in my opinion, reflects acompafative\\y archaic quality to Roman religion, compared with the clas-sical Greek. In other words, older themes buried under Greek classicalmyth, or lost entirely, are more accessible in their native Roman forms.In"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTERPRETATIONthe case of Mars - warrior, protecror, herdsman and god of boundaries -qualides lost or rejected by the Greeks, perhaps by the Egyptians too inthe case of Set, were still celebrared in Roman culture.Things become clearer when we recall the relation of Kronos withCretan Zeus.The gods - and the goddesses - do not reduce ro one by anynecessary rule, but they frequendy are modes of each other. The infantZeus cannot be king of the gods, but there has to be one; this in a sense isKronos, but in some respects, impossible or otherwise, it is also the adultZeus. Father Zeus cannot be a monster persecuting himself as an infant;or, as we usually refer to the younger god, Dionysus. Nevertheless, thisyoungster is destined to rule in his place; and Zeus' avoidance of this inthe case of Achilles tells us a good deal. So, though it cannot be so, he alsois that monster, though appearing in disguise in the Kronos role. If theyoung god is not slain, we the worshippers cannor eat him and becomeone with him. Nevertheless, though he dies, he lives, becomes king of thegods and defeats the terror, the terror that is he.Just as we, who have tornhim limb from limb and consumed him, go hunting through the dark,either for the lost boy or his killers.The slain god, or dead king, who both is and is not the beautiful youth-ful hero, goes on to unite with the goddess and become Lord of thelJnderworld, his srarus undiminished. we see this quite plainly with thepost morrem rule of Achilles with Helen or Medea as his queen. So toodo we see it in Kronos or Saturn as lord of the Elysian Fields. The deifyingpower of the Underworld, usually in serpentine form, also cloaks rhe godin a mask of terror. The terror evoked by the Lord of the Underworld isone we often forget when considering Osiris. We remember the Egyptiangod unites with his wife after death; we remember that a dangerous godthreatens the infant Horus. We forget that Osiris commands legions ofthe dead, recalling only that his rule is wise.Whether considered as the Roman Saturn or rhe Greek Kronos, hisis an exceedtngLy complex character.In Roman cult his festival was bothhugely popular and authentically ancient.

His supposed Etruscan origins fare no better, in-deed the former attribution of Phrygian or Cretan connections is morecredible. The all-important Capitoline Hill at the centre of Roman reli-gion was originally sacred to him, so we may most usefully consider himan authentic Italian god whose cult later underwent Greek infuence. Thisinfluence to some extent appears to have emphasised or been adapted tocharacteristics already present. The Iaying of the god's statue on a couchfor feeding is a general borrowing shared with the other gods. Flowever,Roman celebration of his sacrifice in the Greek fashion, with head uncov-ercd, far from implying deference to the Greeks typifies rather the inver-sions charactedstic of the god.His feast day was December t7'h, andthe Saturnalia continued for sevendays thereafter, despite attempts of Emperors to shorten it. His statue,kept bound with rope during the rest of theyear, was ritually untied onthis day. Another feast day, the Sigillaria, fell, on the seventh day, interest-ingly the Wrum spirit ruling the Winter Solstice bears the name Segal.Social divisions were, within acknowledged limits, either abolished or in-verted during Saturnalia. The wearing of felt hats, representing liberation,was customary for all during the celebrations. Slaves celebrated noisily,running shouting through the streets without fear of punishment. Theywere at liberry to mock their masters, who served them dinner before eat-ing themselves.It was customary to give gifts on the last day; originally, these were clayheads, likely representing former sacrifices. These gifts were accompaniedby written mottoes. The burning of candles was also custo mary, and thesemay involve sympathetic magic, as the rebirth of the Sun (Sol Invicta) fallsduring the same period. As is apparent, both the date and many aspects ofthese festivities survive in the modern Christmas.For this limited time, Saturn or Kronos exceeds Zeus in power, while inthe order of Ages and in the planetary week he precedes him. He is at oncethe Lord of Misrule and the chief of the planets, while his eschatologicalroles underline his centrality to our theme."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"GOETIC GALLERY: BARBARIC,'ECosingasosrNGAS, MoRE coRREcrLy KosrNGAS, was a Thracian king andpriest to the Thracian tribes of the Kebrenoi and Sykaiboai. The im-portance of Thracian royal cults to the developmenr of the GreekMyscery tradition cannot be underestimated, although important fea-tures may have been suppressed. For example there was a powerful sex-ual element in certain Thracian rites, whereas the oracular priestesses ofOlympian cults were sworn to chastity. Although officially sanctioned theBacchic rites, which were of Thracian origin, were the subject of somecontroversy due - among other things - to the supposed potential forsexual license involved.On the other hand there were also Thracian ascetics, vegetarian and cel-ibate, accounting in part for the comparisons made with Pythagoreanism.Incidentally, the rites of Eleusis were said to have been founded by aThracian named Eumolpus, and his descendents were heredkary hiero-phants. This descent is said to have continued for noo years, somewhatastonishingly, since the hierophants were also sworn to celibacy once inoffice. To avoid sexual feelings during the rituals they were required toanoint their genitals with juice of hemlock.The significance of Kosingas is remarked upon by Mircea Eliade.According to a writer in the time of Marcus Aurelius (a Macedonianwith the alarming name of Polyaenus), Kosingas threatened to ascendto heaven by ladder to speak of the outrageous behaviour of his peopleto the goddess Hera. This ascent by ladder is typical of shamanic ritualand the association with the Thracians is important. It appears that theGreeks were well aware of such ritual ascents, which may have formed apart of Orphic initiations; occasionally stairs appear to have been substi-tuted. Part of the tribe of the Kebrenoi appears to have been among theThracian immigrants to Asia Minor.

Similarly, the survival of the soulafter death is typical of the teachings of the Mysteries. This belief ap-pears to have been widespread among Thracian peoples, who believedthat after death they would go to Zalrnoxis, and subsequently return rolife. This cannot but have impressed the Greeks, knowing of the teach-ings of Pythagoras. The Thracian connections of other ecstatic slain andrisen gods and heroes connected with the Mysteries, such as Dionysusand Orpheus, are also importanti according ro some Zalmoxis is to beidentified with Sabazius. Eliade, while accepring shamanic elemenrs en-tered Greek culture in some fashion, does not counr Zalmoxis among rheGreek shamans, pointing rather to the strong connections between thematerials relating to him with the Mystery religions. At the same time heaccepts that Zalmoxis is identifiable as a god of a people among whomshamanism was prevalent. Plato refers to the association of Zalmoxiswith the healing arts in his Charmides:... such I said, is the narure of the charm, which I learned when serv-ing with the army from one of the physicians of the Thracian kingZalmoxis, who are said to be so skilful that they can even confer im-mortality.

For as he declared, all good and evilwhether in the body or in human nature, originates in the soul, andoverflows from thence, as if from the head into the eyes. And thereforeif the head and body are to be well, you muft begin by curing the soul;that is the firft thing. And the cure, my dear youth, has to be effe&edby the use of certain charms, and these charms are fair words; andby them temperance is implanted in the soul, and where temPeranceis, there health is Speedily imparted, not only to the head, but to thewhole body. And he who taught me the cure and the charm at the sametime added a $ecial dire&ion: Let no one,he sard, persuade you to curetbe head, until he has fr{l given you his soul to be cured by the cbarm.

Cornelius Agrippa - the primary authority of the traditionespoused - reckoned the ancient fame of Zalmoxis as so extensive as toshare withZorcasrer the reputation of founder of the magical arts (OccuhPbilosophy rrrl). This places Thracian shamans on an equal footing withthe Persian and Chaldean Magi, as regards both influence and power.t6"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"AristeasAristeas was an epic poet of the ciry of Proconnesus. This was a Thraciancity on an island in the Sea of Marmara, offthe northern coasr of ancientPhrygia. It lays north-west of Cyzicus, anorher island city which was animportant stage on the roure of the Argonauts. The date of his life is un-certain, though it is said to have been in rhe age of Croesus king of Lydia(in the 6'h century ncr). He is described as a magician whose soul wasable to leave his body and return at will; according to Pliny in the formof a raven leaving his mouth. According ro Herodotus, Aristeas spoke ofhaving accompanied Apollo, assuming the form of a crow.One famous story told of Aristeas is that he entered the shop of a fullerin Proconnesus and died. The fuller shur his shop and ser our to notifythe reladves of the poer. As news of his death spread, a man arrived fromCyzicus declared that he had met and spoken with Aristeas who was onhis way to Cyzicus. The fuller returned to his shop, accompanied by manywitnesses, but the body was not to be found. He is said to have rcappearedto his countrymen seven years after this mysterious death. He was con-nected with the worship of Apollo, and apparentLy introduced his cult atthe ancient city of Metapontum in Italy after a second disappearance ofz+o years (the 6gure 54o is also found). This city also has a remarkableconnection with the life of Pythagoras.Aristeas was an epic poet of a tradition predating the Homeric form.His work told how, possessed by Apollo, he travelled the greatil part of rheworld. In particular he travelled to rhe sacred land of the Hyperboreans.Here he met with the Arimazpi, who represenr a Scythian tribe. In thepoem of Aristeas he depicts the Arimazpi as a very numerous warriorrace, who possessed great herds of horses, sheep and cattle. Their bod-ies were strong, their hair both long and thick. They had one eye in themiddle of their foreheads and lived on the banks of a gold bearing river.Their land was renowned for its gold, which ir possessed in abundance.The legends tell of gold obtained from the mines by griffins, upon whomthe Arimazpiwaged consranr war ro sreal the gold, by special knowledgewhich they alone possessed."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Aside from the single eye and the griffins, this description matches theScythians and their Thracian brothers very well. Mythically the single eyeunites the Arimazpi with the metal working Cyclops. In ancient timesthe single eye was rationalised as a miner's lamp, which glowing eerily inthe dark could resemble an eye. Some modern interpretations suggest acircular tattoo on the forehead, which is credible since both Scythiansand Thracians practiced tattooing. Griffins too are an authentic motif ofthe culture of the steppe peoples, Scythian, Mede and Persian alike. Theirpresence in the Arimazpi epic is not the invention of an imaginative Poet;the magical rreasure guarding bird survives in various guises in ancientwritings, in folklore and in the grimoires.Aelianus Claudius, a Roman sophist of Praneste who wfote exquisiteGreek, recorded ancient tradition concerning griffins in his writings. Hedescribes a creature with a lions body, having white wings and powerfultalons. Their backs were feathered in black, and the chest red. Ctesias, whorecorded many Assyrian and Persian legends, mentions grif6ns with violetfeathers on their backs, possessing a vulture's head and eyes like lightning.They built inaccessible nests on gold rich mountains. There they guardedthe gold, from which they made their nests.Isidorus of Sevilla locates grif-fins in the gold bearing mountains of the Hyperboreans.

It is appropriate that this should occur atthis central stage of the story, for her role is utteriy pivotal to it. The oPen-ing of this analysis of the third book therefore begins with her. Medeasmother's identity was a matter of some disagreement among the old writ-ers, although all agreed that her father was Aeetes, King of Colchis, andthat she was the grand-daughter of his father,the Sun god Helios. Hesiodand Hyginus, who are the more reliable authorities, name her mother asIdyia, while others mention Ephyre, Asterodia, Antiope or Neaera. Shewas the priestess of the great goddess Hecate, who is also credited withbeing her mother. She was also the niece of that other famous sorceressof Greek myth, the enchantress Circe, whose role in the Odyssey is almostas crucial as Medeas in the Argonautica,Hecate,Cftce and Medeaarctheessential female characters in the Graco-Roman mythology of witchcraft'The close relationship of this trio of enchantresses is both apt and im-portant. Before delving deeper into the nature and deeds of Medea it isnecessary to examine more closely the context in which she appears. Ofparticular importance in many resPects are her father, King Aeetes ofColchis, and his intriguingly close relationship with the gods. Aeetes is theson of the Sun god Helios, whose solar role long predates Apollo's. Thisin itself points to the great antiquity of the epic, older even than Homerwhich also predates Apollo's association with the Sun. It is necessary tounderline the fact that the lineage of Aeetes exceeded that of mortal he-roes, typically sired by a deity upon a mortal. The mother of Aeetes wasthe Oceanid or sea-nymph Perseis, daughter of Oceanus; and according toHesiod and Hyginus his children, Medea, Chalciope and Apsyrtus, werefathered upon another Oceanid named Idyia. He and his family have theappearance of a virtual pantheon, and this goes a long way to explainingtheir power and the interest the gods have in them."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"JASON AND MEDEAone such deiry is Hephastus. At the beginning of this book of theArgonautica the goddesses Hera and Athena confer as to how they mayassist Jason, and quickly conclude that Aphrodite's assistance is required.Accordingly they visit her palace on olympus, which Apollonius remindsus was built by Hephastus. As if by contrast with this evenr, shortly after-wardsJason and his fellow heroes arrive at the palace of Aeetes. They areimmediarely awestruck by a wonderful fountain outside it, also wroughtby Hephastus. Nor is this the only gifr that Hephastus has bestowed onthe king, as will be seen later.The kingdom of Aeetes is close by the rock of prometheus, another6re god whose mythology is closely inrerwoven with that of Hephastus.Aeetes is the son of the god of the Sun, and possesses greattreasures givenhim by Hephastus. All this underlines the status of Aeeres, and also re-minds us that his kingdom was an early cenrre of excellence in the metal-lurgical arts. From rhe r5'l'ro 8'h century BcE rhe Colchians developed anexpertise in smelting and casting metal long prior to similar developmentsin Europe. This pre-eminent position depended on the presence through-out the region of the metallurgical caste known to ancienr geographersand historians as the Chalybes, and commemorated in myth as rhe Idx.anDactyls. These same 6gures, as has been shown at lengrh ,werethe discov-erers of metals, but also the founders of the Mysteries and the very first tobe referred to in ancient literature as goetic magicians.In the late Bronze Age Colchis however was nor a hilltop village refugeof a shrinking tribe, but a great and powerful kingdom. Its true place inthe history of magic has been overlooked due to the oriental focus of laterreligious bias. As the place of convergence between the lore of Scythiaand the rdx,an Dactlys, Colchis is at least as important in this history asany nation of the Middle East. A1l this considered it makes perfect sensethat Colchis should be the home of the pre-eminenr sorceress in Classicalmythology.The role of Hephastus in this third book has already been briefly intro-duced. Apollonius seems to be taking pains ro mention him often ar rhispoint in the epic. The palace of Aphrodite which he built is the location ofthe meetin g of Hera, Athena and Aphrodite. It will be recalled that these"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"three goddesses are the contestants for the apple of Eris at theJudgementof Paris. While too complex to enter into here, this motif predates notonly Homer's lliad, but also had originally a quite different significance.After Hera and Athena enlist the aid of Aphrodite in their plans she visitsher son, Eros, to entice him into causing Medea to fall in love with Jason.To accomplish this she offers him a splendid ball, seemingly a toy butactually a cult object. This she tells him was made for him by Adrestia,the nurse of Zeus when he was a child in the Idaan cave. Its splendouris underlined by her telling him that not even Hephastus could fashionsuch a wonder.A little larer the fountain of Aeetes palace is described, and this productof Hephastus' art is replete with signi fi.cance. It was composed of fourperennial springs, reminiscent of the four rivers of Hades or the paradiseof Genesis. One of these flowed with milk, another with wine, the thirdwith fragrant oil and the fourth with water. These are of course liquids oflibation in the rituals of Greek religion, More intriguing still, the fountainof water produced water that was warm when the Pleiades were rising,but as cold as ice when they set. The Greek word for libation, particularlywith wine, was spendein; this is plainly derived from the Hittite sipandiand represents Bronze Age infuences. Such ofFerings were made to gods,whether celestial or chthonic, and to heroes. In this type of ofFering theliquid, usually the first part of it alone, is tipped by hand. There is anotherterm, cboe, which represents libadons of the whole contents of the vessel,which is made exclusively to chthonic entities - both gods and the dead- and may be made by hand or tipped from a vessel stood on the ground'This is composed of mixed honey, wine and water.Additionally, Hephastus had made Aeetes a pair of bulls with hoovesand heads of brass, which breathed great blasts of fire. Besides these hehad forged a plough from a single prece of indurated steel. This was ap-parently a thanks offering to the god Helios, who was suPPosed to haverescued Hephastus during the war of the gods and giants. It is interest-ing to note that this war began at Phlegra in Macedonia, which was nota part of civilised Greece. It was resumed at a place of the same name, inSouthern Italy near Cumx, which was afterwards called Vesuvius.

The need of Hephastus for rescuing inthe first place is thus thrown into doubt, the likelihood being that this ispart and parcel of the reduction of his former prestige. The relationshipbetween Hephestus and Helios commemorated in the epic is powerfullysuggestive of familial relations between deities relevant ro ancienr ritual.As will be seen as this study proceeds, the bulls and the plough have anintegral role to play, in which just such a ritual appears to be described.Before this ler us rerurn to the meeting of rhe three goddesses, whereHera queen of the gods expresses with vehement passion her determina-tion to assistJason.Jason, she points our, faces dire calamity, and she isprepared to do anything in her power ro save him even if he sails to Hadesto rescue Ixion from his chains. This is a very significant phrase; for theArgonauts are of course embarked on a mission to rescue a soul, and theArgo - or Arrow - is the shamanic vehicle for entering the underworld.Meanwhile Jason and his men are in conference on their ship; the planis formed thatJason and a handful of others will go to the palace of Aeetesto negotiate for the Golden Fleece. Jason takes with him the Wand ofHermes, by which is likely meanr a herald's wand, which according ro cus-tom grants safe passage to its bearer. On their way they pass willows andosiers, frorn whose branches hang corpses wrapped in ox hide, for, we aretold, the Colchians neither burn nor bury their male dead, but hang themfrom trees; burying only their women. Thus, Apollonius tells us, earrhand air both play equal parrs in disposal of the dead. rn fact, since tombshave been found in the region, it is likely that these bodies had some othersignificance. This detail need not detain us aparr from adding an eerienote to the approach to the city. During this approach the thoughtfulHera covered the city with a mist, so that the heroes might approach thepalace of Aeetes unchallenged. Once they had arrived before the gates themist dispersed, that they might appreciate the wonders before themr thewide gates, soaring columns, the marble cornice and its bronze supporrs.Not far distant were lofty vines fed by the fountains Hephastus had madefor the king.

Thus Medea is the 6rst to seeJason and his companions appear.It is her cry on first laying eyes on himthat alerts the palace to their presence. Before longJason and Aeetes comeface to face and the king learns the object ofJasons visit, and is enragedand mistrustful. Just as King Pelius had set Jason the seemingly impos-sible task of fetching the fleece, so King Aeetes sets another to prevent it:I will giue thee the fleece to bear away, rf thou do{t wish, when I have triedthee. For again{f brave men I bear no grudge. And the trial oJ your courdgeand might shall be a conte{t which I myself can compass witb my hands,deadly tbough it is. Two bulls with feet of bronze I have tbat pallure on theplain of Are' breathing forth flame from tbeir jaws; tbem do I yoke anddrive over the {tubborn four-acre feld of Ares; and quickly cleaving it withthe plough up to tbe ridge, I ca{t into the furrows tbe seed, not the corn ofDemeter, but tbe teeth of a dread serpent tltat grow uP into the forms ofarmed men; tbem I slay at once, cutting tbem down beneath rny lpear asthey rise again{t me on all sides.

For indeed it is unseemly that ct braveman should yield to a coward.The bulls and the plough arc of course the works of Hephastus previ-ously described. The freld of Ares, the name the Greeks gave to their godof war, is adjacent to the place where the Golden Fleece hangs on a treeguarded by a great serpent. This is plainly a rirual sefting and the plough-ingfeat is - beneath the Classical overlay - a memory of that rite.Thenames of Greek gods empioyed are part of this overlay.

So here it appears very likely that in rhe original contextgods later represented by Hephâ‚¬srus and Ares were similarly connected.Although Roman deities often became indistinguishable from theirsupposed Greek counrerparts the god Mars is a major exception. Hisname had more ancient formsr Mavors, Mamers and the Etruscan Maris.His earlier form had strong agricultural associarions, appropriate to theploughing of the 6eld of Ares. These agricultural functions are underlinedby the spring and early summer timing of his major festivals. The nameMars is connected with words such as margin denoting boundaries, anassociation which may connect him with archaic forms of Hermes, whosephallic image was 'Pelasgiani His later exclusively warlike associationsconnect back to his ancient role as defender of the 6elds and people. Fromarchaic times he was identified with the pastoral god Sylvanus. He wasalso the parthenogenic son ofJuno, born after she had been impregnatedby a flower. This is strongly reminiscent of the birth of Attis in the Greekmyth of Cybele, as also the parthenogenic birth of Hephastus.This then is the archaic background of the feat of ploughing the field ofAres with the plough and bulls made by Hephastus.Jason has no choicebut to agree to perform this deed at the appointed time. After his devas-tating interview with Aeetes, Jason and his companions rerurned to theship. Medea, feelingall the pangs of love that the arrow of Eros had incit-ed within her, retired to her chamber, full of dread for what awaits Jason.She prayed to Hecate that Jason should succeed, or should he fail, thathe should at least know that she cared for him.

Choosing life with all its perils instead, in the nextinstant she called her maids to prepare to go to the temPle of Hecate.

Linkage of ritualactions or components with evenrs in the lives of the gods is known as ahistoriola, and is common in the Magical Papyri and elsewhere.

Through combination of verbal and manual magic - thesong of the pestle and mortar - the physical world of the passing momentbecomes simultaneous with myrhic events and persons.The name in Medea's conjuration, Brimo, is a title of both Hecate andPersephone, who indeed in many respecrs are one and the same, even ifHecate takes the role of Persephone's companion in Classical mythology.The title of Maiden probably indicates Persephone, but is equally appro-priate to them both. The title is also directly related to the Latin root fromwhich comes the spirit name Frimost.

Careful readers will note also that Medeashows herself in this passage and those quoted previously to be a supremepharmaceus or enchanter with drugs. This is not the limit of her powersby any means, any more than the frequent connecrion of pharmakoi withgoetes in ancient literature is merely a grouping together of separare rypes.Indeed, as this passage illustrates well, conjuration of underworld deitiesand the gathering and use of powerful plants could be performed by thesame individual at one and the same time."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"GEOS(Although not all of the Argonautica can be retold here, Medea's departurefor the temple contains such a striking analogy it cannot be omitted.Apollonius likens her in her chariot to the goddess Artemis driving herchariot drawn by deer; her maidens he comPares to the nymphs who at-tend the goddess, gathered from giens and streams to follow her; and therownspeople averring their eyes from the royal sorceress as she rides pasthe likens to the animals that pay homage to the Mistress of Beasts.

Another signifi-cant detail is the departure from the ritual site without looking behind.The sound of feet indicates the approach of the goddess, and the bayingof dogs is the sound that heralds her coming.

Jason assures her that he will always remember her,and describes his country. He mentions its \\egendary founder, Deucalion,the son of the Titan and Lord of Fire Prometheus; he is the frrst manto build cities and worship the gods with due ceremony. Deucalion is animportant 6gure in a variety of contexts; not least that he is the hero ofthe Greek equivalent of the Great Flood of the biblical Genesis; his shipmaking landfall at Mount Parnassus rather than Ararat in the region ofColchis. A principal difference in the two accounts is that rather than be-ing chosen to survive by God he is warned by his father Prometheus, therebel against the All-Fatber. In this way the Greek story is closer to theSumerian original, wherein Enki warns his favourite of the impendingflood sent by the chief deity. The Greeks likely obtained this story fromHittite or Hurrian sources in Asia Minor.After the Flood Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha repopulate the earth bycasting stones behind them; those thrown by Deucalion becoming men,those by Pyyrhawomen. This came about through Deucalion and his wifeasking the goddess Themis for an oracle showing them how to populatetheir landi given the proximity of Parnassus to Delphi this indicates theperiod before Apollo became lord of that shrine.In this way Prometheus isresponsible for the creation of the race of humanity a second time.

He found the heifer and wishing to thank thegods with a sacrifice sent his companions to a nearby grove to fetch warer.The grove, like the field where the Golden Fleece was guarded, belongedto Ares. The waters there were guarded by a great serpent, which we maysuspect coiled around one of the trees of the grove. All his companionswere slain, and Cadmus came himself ro see why they had not returned.Seeing the serpent eating their bodies he fought and slew it with the aidof Athena.

As when Jason sowed the teeth, theresprang from the earth armed men; as withJason also Cadmus cast a stoneamongst them causing them to fight each other. Where the story differs isinteresting, for there were 6ve survivors, the Sparti or sown men; these as-sisted him in building his city and became the ancestral heroes of the no-ble families of Thebes. Their names werer Pelorus, Hyperenor, Oudaeus,Chthonius and Echion.Echion married a daughter of Cadmus named Agave whose sisterSemele was mother of Dionysus. Echion and Agave produced Pentheus,who was later the Theban king whose opposition to Dionysus is thetheme of the Bacchce. Echion was also the name of an Argonaut, rwinbrother of Eurytus and son of Hermes. Eurytus is in turn the name of oneof the Giants, who was slain by Dionysus.Incidentally, Cadmus had ro serve as rhe slave of Ares for eight years roatone for the slaying of the serpenr; he then became king of Thebes withthe assistance of Athena. All of which confirms that the sowing of theserpent's teeth represenrs an archaic and chthonic rite of kingship, whichis how Aeetes can tell Jason he has often performed the task (withoutexhausting the supply of teeth).

Note however the convergence through the sownmen of ancestral snaky heroes and the serpent-legged Giants. The mythsof Deucalion and Cadmus clarify the Argonautica; revealing that the menspringing from the sown serpent's teeth were ancestral heroes, represent-ing the 6rst chiefs of ancient clans. The Greek term for these earthbornmen is autochtbons, a term used of the daimons of the Magical Papyri (seepcM rv ry+5 e.TbeTrue Grimoire p.r8).Striking too - in this kingly nte - is the prominence of Ares, a devaluedfigure in Olympian myth; this is the warrior aspect of the hero, which isalso part of the nature of Dionysus.In theBaccbre - which is set at Thebesand involves the Pentheus already mentioned - we are told that Dionysushas a part in the work of Ares, the madness of war. Dionysus was alsocelebrated for his victorious and warlike campaign across the world.The end of the story of Cadmus should be noted before moving on. Inlater Life he and his wife leave Thebes under mysterious circumstances,are transformed into snakes, and find their way to the Elysian Fields. Theattentive reader will note this signi{ies their transformation into chthonicheroes and their privileged place in the Underworld. This is comparableperhaps to Achilles and Medea in the afrcrlife, reigning on the WhiteIsland as blessed ancestral frgures.To return to the Argonautica: Jason invoked Hecate as advised byMedea, the ritual and the visitation of the deity is worth quoting here:Jason...went to a desert $ot, like some {tealthy thieJ, with all that wasneedful; for beforehand in the daytime had he taken thought Jor everything;and Argus came bringing a ewe and milkfrom the flock; and them he tookfrom the ship. But wben tbe hero saw a place whicb was far dway Jrom thetread of men, in a clear meadow beneatb the open sky, there fr{t of all hebathed bis tender body reverently in the sacred river; and round him beplaced a dark robe, which Llypsipyle of Lemnos had given bim aforetime, amemorial of many a loving embrace."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The bathing and robing follow a format still found in the later grimoires.Then he dug a pit in the ground of a cubit's depth and heaped up billets ofwood, and over it he cut the throat oJ the sheep, and duly placed the carcasedbove; and he kindled the logs placing fre beneatb, and poured over themmingled libations, calling on Hecate Brimo to aid bim in tbe conte{ts.As mentioned before, this offering is of the chthonic rype, rhe whole vic-tim is offered. No altar is raised, the offering is made in a pit instead; therite Jason performs illustrates the traditional procedures.And when he had called on her he drew back; and sbe heard him, the dreadgotldess, Jrom the uttermo{t depths and came to tbe sacnfce of Aeson's son;and round ber borrible serpents twined themselves among the oak bouglts;and there was a gleam oJ countless torcbes; and sbarply bowled around berthe hounds of bell.The manifestation of the goddess plainly follows the later type, when shehas become wholly a goddess of magic.

For now it is sufficient to note thar the serpent and the tree areconnected as a motif. In fact a second serpent and tree, guarding not theFleece but the apples of the Hesperides, is encountered in a later part ofthe story. Yet a third is a background figure in the epic, the grove guardingserpent whose teeth are sown in the Field of Ares. This serpenr roo is as-sociated with Ares, to whom the grove belonged.The serpent coiled around a tree is an important element of Thracianiconography.It has been assumed too often that the serpent is a figure ofevil, as in the story of Adam and Eve. While this may be the case in MiddleEastern myth, perpetuated in later Western contexts by St. George andthe dragon, there are no grounds for assuming a similar meaning in olderGreek and Thracian contexts. In fact all the evidence is counter-indica'tive to this interpretation. As E.V. Rieu notes in his introduction to TheVoyage of the Argo the author is plainly not averse to snakes, quite thecontrary, he represents them extremely sympathetically.In Thracian de-pictions of the hero he is frequently hunting and spearing a wild boar. Inthese images the motif of the serpent and tree is often portrayed, but thehero is never shown attacking it. The most straightforward interpretationof all is plainly that the serpent represents the chthonic form of the hero,or the god with whom in death he is identified. This perhaps explains thecurious images on Greek poftery depicting Jason regurgitated from theserPents mouth, a motif never encountered in surviving lkerary sources,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Powerfully supportive of this interpretation is the fact that a serpent is themost common symbol of'post-mortem' hero cults.The famous Letnitsa treasure of pictorial golden panels - on one ofwhich ritual hierogamy of the goddess-daughter and hero-son is por-tayed extremely graphically - contains a depiction of a woman bearing amirror alongside a three headed serpent. That this is not an enemy of thehero but his own chthonic form is strongly implied in Euripides'Baccbrc;in a powerful chorus the Manads invoke Dionysus, inviting him to appearin the form of a bull, a many-headed serpent or a fire-breathing lion. Thevery next speech in the play makes mention of the serpent Ophis whosesown teeth produced the crop of earth-born men.The name of Asclepius is probably derived from two Thracian words:ds, a serpent, and klepi,to entwine around a staff This underlines the linksbetween Thrace and the relatively uncivilised region of Thessaly, wherethe Greek cult of Asclepius fourished long prior to the establishment ofhis shrine at Epidaurus. The cult of the late Graco-Roman snake godGlycon combined elements from the cults of Sabazius and Asclepius; farfrom being an innovation both were in fact ancient forms of the hero-son.That Asclepius was a healer reminds us that this is the meaning of thenameJason (himself aThessalian hero), and a common epithet of serpen-tine heroes when invoked at their chthonic shrines.Asclepius was not merely a healer however, but a restorer of the dead tolife.

Sympathiaor Sympathy is a central and all pervading concept of Western magic.Its origins maylay in the religious magic of Egypt, and related ideas arepresent in magical thought the world over. This aside the term itself, andits systemised development in all branches of Western magic, is a prod-uct of Greek thought. It was first enunciated by Parmenides, it was thecore idea in the thought of Empedocles, it was central to the Stoic school,and was enthusiastically adopted and developed by the Neoplatonists.Its adoption by the latter school is of particular importance for Westernmagic. In the Neoplatonist development of Theurgy, which profoundlyinfuenced Medieval and Renaissance occult thought, Sympathia was cen-tral both theoretically and practically.The Universe, according to this idea, was one thing. The Greeks rec-ognised that this being was composed of parts, be they termed elements,principles, or roots. All things within the One were composed of differingcombinations of these roots, be they numbers, gods, animals, plants orstones, places, climates or anything whatever, their essence was defined bythese inherent qualities.In addition, to the degree in which any two thingsresembled each other through shared qualities, they were attractive to oneanorher, regardless of their relative positions in space. This is stated clearlyby both Plotinus and Iamblichus: tbe Universe is one being its ytarts sepa-rated by $ace, but tbrough possession of one nature are drawn rapidly together.Such parts may be superior or inferior to each other in nature, without inthe least diminishing their attraction for one another."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"This conception was originally based on the four elements and rhe prin-ciples of attraction and repulsion, dependent on like and unlike qualities.These four elements of course are not to be confused with what modernsunderstand by the terms; they are more akin to the states of matrer rec-ognised in modern science. Thus the Earth of the Greeks resembles notsoil or sand merely, but what scientists call solids; Water signifies qualitiesinherent in what scientists term liquids; Air gases and Fire plasmas. Theelements thus represented the subjective experience of a given thing, itscharacteristics and behaviour, rather than its objective chemical constitu-ents.As time went on this classification was systematised: Fire possessed thequalities of heat and dryness, Earth possessed dryness and cold, Watercold and moisture, Air moisture and heat. Fire therefore shared the qual-ity of heat with air, and the quality of dryness with earth. Through thelack of any shared quality fire was antipathetic to water.On this basis the offerings and ceremonies of religion and magic, asunderstood by the Greeks, included materials conducive to attracting thegods or other beings it was desired to invoker Tbeurgic art, knowing thisand having discovered appropriate vessels conJorming to the di{tin& naturesof diferent gods, often conne(ts together {tones, berbs, animals, aromatics, andother sacred, perfeCt and godlike sub{tances oJ similar kind; then Jrom these itproduces a complete and pure receptacle. For it is not proper to de$ise all mat-ter, but only that foreign in nature to the deities invoked.This application of sympathia, as interpreted by the Neoplatonists, gaveWestern magic the doctrine of correspondences. The original elementalclassification also underwent modification and development. In this de-velopment the original elemental classification was extended and diver-si6ed into planetary and zodiacal symbols. Nevertheless, the elementalsymbolism is the basis of the more complex classifications, which can gen-erally be reduced into these simpler terms.The development of the original concept of Sympathy is also central toastrological thinking. Planets and Signs possess affiniries and antipathiestowards one another. The manner in which any configuration manifestsitself is determined through these inter-relations.

Despite the presence of star-lorein earlier cultures, Babylonian and Egyptian in particular, astrology is aHellenistic system. The star-lore of the other cultures was not used toproduce astrological charts for individuals, nor was the Zodiac as weknow it a feature of any of them. In almost every essential the systemof astrology known in the West is a product of the Hellenistic era. Thedegree to which astrology underlies the whole conception of magic in thegrimoires cannot be easily over-emphasised. Astrology is the most irrefu-table example of the central place of Greek thought - rather thanJudao-Christian theology - in the system of the grimoires.EmpedoclesEmpedocles of Agrigentum in Sicily, flourished +++ scn. His most A-mous maxim has been restated in various ways down the centuries: Godis an infnite $here whose centre is euerywbere, and whose circumference isnowhere. His place in history is assured by his distinguishing the four el-ements and his explanation of the development of the Universe by theforces of Love and Hate (Sympathy and Antipathy), or ar moderns wouldsay, attraction and repulsion.The laws of sympathy (and antipathy) formed a very substantial part ofthe magical theory of the ancient world, as indeed of the medieval periodand the Renaissance. This kind of magic, termed sympathia, was distin-guished from devalued goetia by Plodnus, the father of Neoplatonism;it was also accepted by the medieval Church. The great. theorists ofRenaissance Hermeticism, Mirandola and Cornelius Agrippa among oth-ers, were anxious to be understood as using this permitted magic, not goe-tia. Yet Diogenes Lartius reported that Gorgias, the famed sophist andpupil of Empedocles, rcferred to his master as a goen. In other words, theconcept of sympathia originates in Goetia prior to its devaluation."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":")PHIAThe description Empedocles gave of the four elements was framed poeti-cally in semi-mythological terms: Hear fr{t theJour roots of all things: brightZeus,life givingHera, and Aidoneus, and NeJZis u,bo moiltens tbe $rings ofmen with ber tears. The usual interpretation of these equates Zeus withfire, Hera with air, Aidoneus - a name of Hades - equates with earth,and Nestis with water; an alternative view, with ancient and modern ad-vocates, prefers Air for Zeus, Earth for Hera, Fire for Aidoneus and waterfor Nestis. The name Nestis is unknown from other sources, but appearsto represent Persephone. Firstly by analogy with the 6rst pair mentioned,she would be the partner of Hades, also the name means without eat'ing, and tearful Persephone fasted in the LJnderworld. This identificationis also accepted in academic studies of Empedocles; particularly PeterKingsley, who combines the insights of a qualified academic and an unre-pentant mystic. The description continues in terms rnore suited to whatwas once known as Natural Philosophy or as we call it, Science: And these[elements] never cease changing place continually, now being all united byLove into one, now each borne apart by the batred engendered of Strfe, untilthey are brought together in tbe unity oJ'tbe all, and become subject to it.

It may be morelikely that Telauges was a consecrared successor of Pythagoras, makingEmpedocles the successor of an occult Pythagorean lineage. Curiouslyhowever, accounrs of the life and death of Empedocles draw on a'letrerof Telaugesl who is also referred to as Jelanges, son of Pythagoras. Thisletter was written to Philolaus, himself a famed Pythagorean philosopherof y+ ncE, who proposed a revolving Earth in a heliocentric Solar sys-tem, and may have written the Golden Wrses attributed to Pythagoras.This Telauges cannot be the master of Empedocles. Whatever rhe case,Empedocles taught the doctrine of transmigration associated withPythagoras, and other Pythagorean concepts, and was evidently consid-ered highly by Iater Pythagoreans. His writings included an accounr ofthe bodies he had previously occupied: ...1 was born once a boy, and amaiden, and a ytlant, and q bird, and a dartingfsh in the sea. These transfor-mations - like those of Pythagoras - resemble the symbols of a Mysterycult. He termed the transmigrating soul, which possessed the power ofattaining divinity, the damon. Dodds suggesrs an identity between thisindwelling spirit and the soul of the shaman which can be separated fromthe body during life, and migrate from one incarnarion ro another. Theoriginal form of this concept is not that all souls transmigrate, but that inthis way a magician inherits power from his former existences. An Indianorigin for this Pythagorean teaching has often been brought forward, butthere is no evidence for it, and a more localised origin is far more likely. Adescription by Empedocles of an unnamed man, who tradition takes tobe Pythagoras, supports this idea of accumulated knowledge and power:And there was among them a man of unusual knowledge, and ma{ter etpe-cially of all sorts olf wise deeds, who in truth possessed greateSl wealth of mindJor whenever he reached out with all his mind, easily he beheld eacb one of allthe things that are, even for ten and twenty generations of men.His pupil Gorgias is reputed to have rcferred to Empedocles as a goenwithout implying disapproval.

His disciples were informed that hecould teach them to make the wind blow or cease, the rain to fall or the sunto shine, to banish sickness and old age, and to revive the dead. Significantlythis revival is described as a rescuingjourney to the Underworld.Not surprisingly, his reputation amonglater writers on magic and thecabala is considerable: he is mentioned several times by Cornelius Agrippain the Three Books of Occult Philosophy, and cited as one of his authori-ties by the famous astrologer-magician Michael Scot.

Accounts of his death, and his age on dy-ing are extremely contradictory; with the same mixture of rationalisingand mythic symbolism as accounts of his life. However, the oldest storiescredit him with bodily translation from the level of humanity to that ofdivinity. There is a tradition that Empedocles was - like Pythagoras - anincarnation of the archer god Apollo.Lirerary materials regarding Empedocles vary from the rationalistic tothe mystical or mythological. The impression is inescapable that all areincomplete attempts to make sense of older traditions that were not wellunderstood to either kind of author. Modern academics are naturally cau-tious in assessing such material. Such caution led to Charles Kahn reject'ing the description of Empedocles as a shaman on the grounds we possessno account of Empedocles journeying to the Underworld and returningfrom the dead. Academic caution is commendable and necessary, and theuse of the term shaman in the Greek context is not necessarily helpful.Nevertheless, one is entitled to wonder about the extensive variations inaccounts of Empedocles death.

Also significant is the fact that the single sandal is anemblem of Hecate, whose relation to these goddesses is exrremely close.Diodurus of Ephesus also relates this death by frre; however the Lecrerof Telauges says he slipped and fell into the sea.

Here Melissa was the daughterof Melissus, king of Crete; her sister was Amalthea and together they fedthe infant Zeus with the milk of goats (others say that Amalthea was agoat). Melissa is said to be the first to discover honey; some imagine shewas turned into a bee, since this is the meaning of the name, another ishoney. There is an immense amount of lore from earliest times connected"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"with the bee and with honey. Much of this lore connects with the nameMelissa; here we have space only for a portion of ir.Despite the numerous variants of this myth, two elements recur in all:his guards, and being fed upon honey either by bees or by nymphs calledbees,Zeus was guarded by the Curetes or Corybantes; as counterparts orcompanions of the Dactyls these figures represent the males with whomthe term goetia was anciently connected. In myth, the chain of importantfemale figures named Melissa begins here. Historically and archeologi-cally also they are connected with the same rites and Mysteries fromaveryearly date. Examining some of the women who bore the name providesadditional insights.One such figure in the 7't' century BcE was the wife of Periander - thetyrant of Corinth oz5-585 BcE - who he apparendy slew during preg-nancy. Later he sent messengers to consult the oracle of the dead uponthe Acheron regarding a pledge which had been given into his charge bya stranger but could not be found. Melissa appeared, but refused to tellwhere the pledge was: sbe was cold, she said, since sbebad no clotbes; thosegarments buried with ber were of no use, since they had not been burnt Shegave as proof of truth to Periander a cryptic saying: the oven was cold whenbe baked bis loaves in it.When this message was brought to him, Perianderrecognised the meaning of her proofi that he had secretly slept with hercorPSe.He immediately made a proclamation that all the wives of Corinthshould assemble in the temple of Hera. So the women dressed themselvesin their finest clothes, and came there, as if to a religious festival. Then,with the help of his guards, he stripped them all, making no differencebetween free women and slaves; and, taking their clothes to a pit, he calledon the name of Melissa, and burnt the whole heap. This done, he sent asecond time to the oracle; and Melissa's ghost told him where he wouldfind the stranger's pledge.The details of this story are well known from Diogenes Lartius andother authors, such as Herodotus. It is likely that a degree of rationalisa-tion has taken place, since Periander lived many centuries before thesewriters, who struggled in interpreting religious and magical aspects of+8"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"their past. What is certain is that Periander founded Dionysian rites inCorinth, and that the city maintained close links with the necromanticoracle of Thesprotia; for large finds of Corinthian pottery have been exca-vated there. Daniel Ogden in Greek and Roman Necromancy strggesrs rheevidence points to a major cult of Melissa, perhaps as the presiding geniusof the oracle. It has been suggested that Periander's actions ar the rempleof Hera were misunderstood or misrepresented by later authors; ratherthan a simple act of personal tyranny, what they really represenr is the es-tablishing or reforming of a cult. This is very possible: even Herodotus -who was on occasion influenced by political feeling - wrote two centuriesafter the event, while Plutarch wrote in the first century AD. Periander iswithout doubt a most complex and exotic figure. He was defined by theArchaic period and must have been near inscrutable to the rationalisingclassical intelligentsia. He is no less opaque to modern sensibilities: ac-cused of sending boys from Corcyra to be casrrated inLydia, he was alsoaccounted by most ancient authors to be one of the Seven Sages of Greece.Corinth had substantial and ancient links with the Easr, having noMycenaean past. The cult of Hera in Corinthian territory was ancient;the oldest and most sacred temples of Greek culture all belonged to thisgoddess, and these included a major temple at Perachora, which dated toat least the 8'l' century. Periander's gathering of 6ne clothes for a funerealoffering to Melissa appears to have taken place at the sanctioned outpostof this temple in Corinth itself,If this was a rite,ir. bears comparison withRoman rituals of Fortuna Virilis where female rirual nakedness was thenorm. It is interesting to note that Corinth was visited by Apollonius ofTyana, a Pythagorean reformer. He is alleged to have there tormented afemale vampire named Lamia who appeared in the form of a Phoenicianlady, who may represent Melissa.Corinth also founded the Sicilian city of Syracuse, and maintained closelinks with their colony. Corinthians then had strong links with cult sitesof Persephone, who was equally at home in Sicily or Thesprotia. It hasbeen suggested that Melissa's story is a demythologising of Persephone,and it certainly possesses mythic qualities; but perhaps the evidence sug-gests a more complex relationship, Servius, in a commentary on AeneidI."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"43o wrote of a woman of Corinth named Melissa who refused to initiateothers into the Mysteries after her admission into them. She was torn topieces and Demeter caused bees to spring from her body. This suggestsa context involving both Mystery rites and necromantic oracles. PerhapsPeriander's relationship with Melissa included something akin to the pe-riodic marriage of the wife of the Basileus to Dionysus, whose motherin Orphic theology was also Persephone. The death of either one ofthese Melissas also bears comparison with the death of Dirce in Thebes,where the slain queen became a patron of mysterious rites. The contextfor these tradidons suggests ritualised abduction by'Hades' and marriageto'Dionysusl in which the descent into the underworld is performed by'Melissa1Helios was honoured to an unusual degree in Corinth, unusual that ison the Greek mainland, as distinct from Rhodes. Medea is said to havecome there as an exile , and after her separation fromJason fed the place ina chariot drawn by dragons, which belonged to Helios, the founder of herline. Medeas marriage toJason had taken place in the cave of the daughterof Aristaus, Makris, who had there fed the infant Dionysus on honey, in-dicating that she too was a Melissa. Given the connection of honey, cavesand ancient rites, the account given by Pausanius of the discovery of theoracle of tophonius is also worthy of note:This oracle was formerly unknown to the Boeotians, they discoveredit on the following occasion. No rain had fallen for more rhan a year,so they di5patched envoys to Delphi from every ciry. When askedfor a reme dy for the drought, the Pythian prieftess bade them go toTrophonius at Lebadea, and get the cure from him. But when theycame to Lebade a, and could not 6nd the oracle, Saon, the oldest of theenvoys, saw a swarm of bees, and he advised them that they shouldfollow the bees wherever they went. Straightway he observed the beesflyinginto the earth and followed them to the oracle.The antiquity of Boeotian traditions is well established, and the role ofDelphi in this tale may be a little suspect. The city of Lebadea was situated"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"near Mount Helicon, the pre-Delphic abode of the Muses; it sent a con-tingent to the tojan War.

The ritual has been the subject of a p^per by the editor HansDieter Betz, his analysis of the rite places it in the late 3'd or early 4'l' cen-turyAD, and he sees in it elements of a catabasis ritual from the Mysterycults. This initiation involved both Hecate and the Idaean Dactyls, as atSamothrace. As appropriate for a catabasis ritual, the rite involved a de-scent into a cave. This of course is comparable to that of Tropl-ronios, ofnecromantic oracles and even the grotto of Mithras &c.The ritual in the Papyri however is a charm against fear of punishmentin the Underworld. This alone alerts us to its eschatological background.There are many interesting details in the ritual, not least two authenticprotective rnagical gestures from the period. Two brief formulae precedethe rite (rcrnr LXIX. r-3 e pcM LXX. r-4) wherein similar Protectivefor'mulae are contained. The frrst advocates saying pHNouNEnEE twice, thenlgive me your strength, 16 ABRASAX, give me vour strengtb, for I am rsxA's'Rx, the entire formula is to be repeated seven times, whiie holding yourthumbs. The second, which may be fragmentary, introduces itself as acharm for favour or protection by undoing a hostile spell, further describ-ing itself as a phylactery and a charm for victory. While similar in purposethe words recited differ from the above: aa svprOKoM BASYrvr, protect me.The ritual in question then follows, and in the introduction the ritualistis insrructed to identify themselves with Ereshkigal (in this period seenas identical witl-r Hecate, as becornes apparent) who is the oneholdingherthumbs, referringto the same gesture used above. The magician or initiateuses rhis formula when confronted in the underworld by a chthonic spirit.S6"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"If 'he' (the spirit) approaches after the performance of the above formulaand gesture, then the magician performs another magical gesture, takinghold of their right heel. An additional formula follows, being a recital ofHecate's symbols: virgin, bitch, serpenr, wrearh, key, herald's wand, goldensandal. These are plainly symbols from a Mystery rite, and recur through-out the Papyri.The part of principal interest to Betz, and very relevant ro us, involvesa further recitation. This includes a variant of the Ephesian letters and adeclaration that the ritualist has been initiated, has descended into theunderground chamber of the Dactyls and seen the sacred things (the sym-bols of Hecate aforementioned). The location envisaged for this adven-ture is a crossroads, which while it may also represent an earthly place, isnevertheless synonymous with that in the geography of Hades. The in-structions that follow are speci6c, having performed this, turn around andfee (that is, do not look back as you depart). The conrexr has changed andsimilarly the gender of a potentially dangerous spirit changes. It is in suchplaces, the text avows, that she appears and it is clear that she is Hecate.There follows a' additional and presumably related applicatio n; rccir-ing this formula late at nighr, concerning whatever you wish, the rite willcause it to be shown you in dream. A more serious application then fol-lows; recite it while scattering sesame seeds should an underworld en-tity lead you away for death and it will preserve you. This occasion couldequally be when visiting the underworld as a'shamani or in the post mor-tem state as an initiate possessing special knowledge.These formula ail regard manipulation of the underworld, even thoughthe applications apparently differ. A further ritual then follows, and againHecate theology is clearly discernible; shape a cake from best qualitybran,sandalwood and the sharpest vinegar, write the name of your intendedvictim on it. While doing this the operator looks into a magical light whilesaying the name of Hecate (likely this indicates the recitation of the ap,propriate formula: pHoRBA pHoRBA eRrrao AzzrEByA), adding a requesrto deprive the target of sleep.

The esrpl KATASKET formula is, as we would ex-pect, attributed to the Dactyls; unusually the author also refers to it asthe Orphic formula. This, in my opinion, does not and cannot imply thatthis is an invocation of Orpheus; an interpretation made by Georg Luckin Arcana Mundi. Rather it simply conforms to the ancient idea that therites of the Dactyls came under the tutelage of Orpheus, or as we mightsay, the Orphic movement.On a pracrical level, it is plain that both this formula and the recital ofthe symbols of Hecate - from an authentic initiation ritual - are hercmagical devices for protection in a variety of underworld contexts. So too,the leaving of the site without looking back conforms to both the myth ofOrpheus, and the magical preparations made by Jason for obtaining theGolden Fleece. Plainly, these are authentic and widely known gestures andpractices, worthy of our attention in the modern context.The symbols previously listed occur in a variety of contexts in the papy'ri, of which one is particularly interesting (ncvr vn,756-9a). Throughoutthese fascinating texts a female and lunar form appears, balancing themale solar-pantheistic deity (Abraxas, Helios Aion &..). In this Particu-lar rite appears a list of 4 sounds and z8 symbols. Their number im-plies multiples of the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet and of the sevenplanets corresponding. Of the z8 symbols 2I are animals, the last sevenreproduce the symbols above mentioned. The terms of the incantationreveals that the deity addressed is essentially lunar-pantheistic, only IAOwho made her is higher in nature; she is mistress of the whole world.Thez8 symbols are effectively correspondences of the Lunar Mansions, whichI have taken the liberty of attributing to the conventional Mansions ofthe grimoire tradition, with some additions. As the last seven symbolsdiffer from the remainder insofar as they are not animal symbols, I havealso collated animal symbols from other related rites of the Papyri to sup-S8"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"plement them. The attribution is a convention facilitating work with theindividual mansions. The reader need have no fear that I have made errorsin this attribution. Lunar animals are essentially interchangeable, there isno correct order; four groups of seven such animals would do equally well,following the precedent of other lunar rites.The association of the Mansions with Arab astrology is a misnomer;the Arabs arehere,as elsewhere, the heirs of the Hellenistic synthesis. Thequestion remains, from where did the Greeks obtain themi Earlier schol-arship has shown that they are nor Chaldean in origin. The most likelysource appears to be India, which had a lunar astrology from the period oftheWdas.

As seen in the accounts of thedivine men Empedocles, Pythagoras and others, such rituals not only as-sured the initiate of an agreeable afterlife, but were part of a process ofself deification which - or so we must assume on the basis of availableevidence - was to culminate in the post mortem state. As related in BookFour, the religious rituals of the Greeks routinely used purifications withwater, comparable to modern magical procedures. The Balkan rites dis-cussed there likely reproduce those of a Thracian mystery cult similar tothose of Orphic societies.My own goetic work employs adaptations of Thelemic ritual knownas Pyramidos, particularly its opening and closing. An important aspectof this ritual is that it can be broken down into sub-rituals, which areindeed rituals in their own right. In this respect, among others, the riteis deeply instructive. Comparing it to the Orphic idea delineated above,we become aware that purification rites are not mere preparations for the'big stuff';they are essential processes worth pursuing alone. While theprincipal reason for this is their eschatological significance, the same proc-ess has more day-to-day implications. This capacity is present in Hoodooand other New World traditions, but temporarily lost sight of in Westernmagic.

This underlines the reciprocal relationship of es-chatological concerns in all forms of magic.SelJ'-defication - tlte Magician as HeroThere are r.r.any strands to what I perceive as the importance of reinstat-ing the hero as a spirirual entity in Western magic. One of these is realign-ing the current with its analogues in other cultures thar possess livingmagical traditions that acknowledge the dead. Recognising the evolveddead as important and venerable spiritual entities demands such a place.So too, though after another manner, the lesser ranks of the dead requireour consideration, When we assess the roots of goetia, which are the roorsof modern magic in the West, their current neglect is an absurdity. Fallenangels simply cannot compare with the dead as a natural focus of atten-tion; they represent nothing like as great a part of our evolution and lifeexperience. It is apparent that the roots of the tradition, reaching into thepresent if it were but acknowledged, do indeed make this emphasis; ourresponse should be perfect|y clear.The hero in particular has several natural roles to play,beyond mere lipservice to tradition, which the prominence of said angels principally relieson. In fact, heroes are not merely artefacts of ancient Greek or Thracianculture. While their presence may be unsuspected or unidentified, heroesare nevertheless still present at the centre of grimoire rnagic. This is, tobe clear, the magical hero or hero as magician. Grimoire magic is associ-ated with the names of several such heroes, with whom, consciously ornot, magicians identify themselves. Three such heroes are strongly associ-ated with grimoire magic, namely Solomon, Moses and Enoch. These are,rnythically speaking, the authors of magical rexrs, who first uttered theincantations and wielded the instruments that these texts prescribe. Ineffect, the magician is acting with their authority. We are, as ir were, srep-ping into their shoes; in short, identifying with them. Such an illustriouspredecessor and role model is, simply put, a magical hero.6+"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"An exampre that parricular,, *\",,,;\":;;;,,'r\"\",,r.ation or themagician with a rnagical hero occurs in the Grand Grimoire.This text con-tains a scripted dialogue with a spirit, which the magician is to replicatewhen conjuring. The name of the spirit appears beside the words they willspeak, the name of Solomon beside those the magician speaks:Lucifuge Rofocale; I am here, wbat do you want of me? Why do youdi{turb my repose? Smite me no more with that terrible wand.Solomon: Had{t thou appeared when I Jtr{t called tbee. I should bave notsmitten tbee. Know that if thou do{t not accede to my reque{t, I am deter-mined to torment tbee forever.And so on.Without in the least recommending this procedure, clearly the magicianis rirually following in the footsteps of Solomon. While implicit ratherthan explicit, nothing could be plainer than that the magician is identify-ing with a hero, the ultimate role model, and that the magic is empoweredby so doing. Nor do we have to look very far for examples where thissame identification is completely explicit. The ritual of the Headless One,from which derives Crowley's Liber Samekh, is one way or orher amongthe most famous rituals in modern occultism. This rite, which originatesin the Magical Papyri, involves the magician identifying explicitly withanother hero magician of the grimoire tradition:Tbee I inuoke, the Headle ss One,Thee that did{t create the eartb and tbe beavens...Tbou art Asar un NeJ'er whom no man hath seen at any timeTbou art labas Thou art Iapos...I am Moses your prophet unto whom Tbou did{t comnit thymy{teries celebrated by Israel.6S"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Aleister Crowley advised the magician to replace the name Moses withtheir Adeptus Minor motto, and Israel with his or her'magical race',However, in the original context of the ritual the point still stands. In fact,in terms equally appropriate to that context, Crowley! advice essentiallymeans the magician may adapt it only when his or her own self-deificationprocess reaches a suitable point. That is, when they have become - or arebecoming - a magical hero in their own right.Remaining with Crowley for a moment, he was of course the recipientof an inspired or channelled magical text. Adorations from an Egyptianstele, translated in versified form, are an important part of this text;they and the stele form a concise statement of its cosmogony. Both arein widespread use among Thelemites and other magicians. Some of thepassages of these adorations are equally explicit concerning the role of amagical hero; in this case, an Egyptianpriest named Ankh-af-na-khonsu.Whoever makes these adorations identifies himself or herself with thispriest and claims his authority:I am the Lord of Thebes, and IThe intpired forth-{peal<er of Mentu;For me unueils the veiled sl<y,Th e s elf- slain Ankh - af- n a -kh on suWose words are trutb.I inuoke,I greetThy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!Unity uttermo{t showed!I adore the might of Thy breath,Supreme and terrible God,Who make{t the gods and deathTo tremble before Thee -I,I adore thee!"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Appear on the tbrone of Ra!Open the ways of tbe Kbu!Lighten the ways of the Ka!The ways of the Khabs run throughTo {tir me or {till me!Aum!

There is no rubric advis-ing the adorant to insert his or her own name or those of their own parentsin this rite. It is a straightforward mafter of identifrcation with a magicalhero, in which the names of the parents form additional reinforcement;such reinforcement incidentally forms a frequent part of many rituals ofthe Papyri. These examples are sufficient to establish that heroes remain apresence in the magic of the grimoires and elsewhere. This should not besurprising, although the practical implications may require some assimi-lation.

The followingmaterial is drawn from the grimoire materials included in the augmented1665 edirion(s) of Reginald Scot's Discouerie of witchcrofi.

They are seen as residents in the country de-spite their former'Solomonic' residence in the Middle East. The connec-tion with the Romans is also interesting, suggesting some antiquity - realor imagined - for the traditions with which the imported lore has beenmerged. What is most noreworrhy of all is the connection with WelshBardic lore, this is important given the connecrion of poetry and magicin both Greek and Celtic cultures.

OlausMagnus wrote extensively about magic in Sweden and Norway in ry55and in consequence the North gained a major reputation as the strong-hold of magic in Europe. The magical elements of Scandinavian culturewere certainly known in the British Isles; and this magical text itself issaid to have been composed by a Norwegian magician named Vaganustus.There is also a persistent tradition that Norwegian magicians were resi-dent in England in the reign of Elizabeth I.In this conte$t they do often totally extirpate and deftroy one another,killing and crushing when they meet in mighty and violent Troops inthe Air upon the Sea; and at such cime many of the 6ery fpirits are de-ftroyed, when the Enemy hath brought them offthe Mountain to 6ghtLrpon the water; on the contrary,when the battle is on the Mountain it'sel[, the Spirits of the Air are often wor$ted, and then great mourningsand doleful noises are heard both in Iseland and Russia, and Norwayfor many days after."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":")NJURATIONSBur to i-.roceed to the form of conjuring this aforesaid Spirit, rheMaqicia' 'rudt draw a Circle in a Moonshine night in some solitaryVa11e1'; rhe Circle muft be 16 foor over, and another Circle a foot dis-tance ri'irl-rin rhe same, being both drawn with chalk, and the Exorci$tbeing sirded about with two Snakes skins ryed rogether, and havingmany Snakes skins tyed to his cap, and hanging down before and be-hinde, rnudt also with Chalk draw the form of afrery Mountain ar oneside of the Circle on this manner;The astonishing costume of the magician deserves our artention; it ismatched by similar descriptions elsewhere in the Discouerie.

He asserts also that the spiritsassociated with the phenomena of Mount Hecla were of the same kind.If one thing emerges from all this it is the fact following. When the gri-moires were being composed magicians already appreciated that the socalled evil spirits of the theologians were to be identified wirh the faeriesof the common folk and many entities of antique pagan lore.Indeed, whilethe magicians and their clients cannot be called pagans as such - save inisolated places like Iceland, and in the Baltic - the familiar spirits werenonetheless remnants of the household gods of the pagans, and persistedfar longer than the major gods of rhe old pantheons.Another conjuration from the same source, also making use of the imageof a volcano, follows next."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"oI.osSuouoALAs vENToRu&ro-\"tII(r,)bza**x+zrltrlz?7ndtFqzD'l F'r-i v tu\\ zr a u v Hv tg"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":")NJURATIONSHow to conjure the Spirit Balkin the Master of LuridanAs in the former Chaptea the Exorcift is in$tru&ed ro draw the formof the Mountain Hecla within the circle, so in this form of Conjurationhe mu$t do rhe same, adding these names to be written around theMountain; Rahuniel, Seraphiel, Hyniel, Rayel, Fraciel, These are thenames of Olympick Angels, governing the Norrh, and ruling overevery airy Spirit that belongs unro the Norrhern Climare; so that rheauthority of these names muSt be used in the calling up of this Spirit,because he is a greet Lord, and very lofty, neither will he appear with-out ftrong and powerful Invocations.The angels named closely resemble those from the Heptameron; t\\leyequate with Angek of the ffth heaven ruling on Tuesday, being those whichare called from the North: Rahumel, Hyniel, Rayel, Seraphiel, Mathieland Fraciel.

They travel across and out of mainland Europe by river, andthe major climactic part of the adventure takes place in Libya or Africa.This mirrors our journey, where our route re-examines the impact of an-cient magic on European grimoires, and the relations of our magic to theArab world.The Argonauts fed from Colchis with the Golden Fleece; with a hugeColchian fleet in pursuit. The route of the Argonauts and their pursuersinvolves all manner of geographical impossibilities; some of the detailsmay be based on old accounts of amber trade routes involving journeysoverland and upon rivers. In the Argonautica the land routes have beenomitted and the rivers and oceans have been assumed to intersect conven-iently for a naval pursuit, which they do not. Accordingly the action movesfrom the Black Sea to the Adriatic, where the next important events occur.A horrific murder marks the next major stage of the epic, although thedetails and location vary considerably from one source to another. Theoldest tradition has it that the brother of Medea, Apsyrtus, accompaniedthe Argonauts and that either Medea or Jason slew him and strewed hisdismembered corpse in their wake, that Aeetes, obliged to collect them forproper burial, would be delayed. Apollonius departs from this tradition,rnaking Apsyrtus the leader of the Colchian fleet, who, on agreeingto par-ley is betrayed and murdered byJason at a Temple of Artemis on a sacredisland. Neither version distracts from the main point, which is thatJasonand Mede^were rendered impure through blood guilt."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Jason, in the accounr of Apollonius: cut of the extremities of the dead man,and thrice licl<ed up some blood and tbrice spat the pollution from his teeth, dsit is rightfor the slayer to do, to otone for a treacherous murder.They then buried Medeas brother on rhe island, which, when some oftheir Colchian pursuers settled rhere, was called Apsorus in his mernory.Despite the apparent rightness of the hideous ritual of expiation, Jasonand Medea's crime - a complex case of murder, fraticide and sacrilege -was marked by the Furies for punishment. This was a serious obstacle totheir completion of the quesr's dangers and troubles awaited them untilthe intervention of another seminal figure in the mythology of ancienrmagic.Meanwhile a 6ght with the crew of Apsyrrus'ship followed the murder.Afterwards Peleus the son of Aeacus and father of Achilles, both majorunderworld 6gures, advised flight. The Argonaurs took counsel arnongthemselves and perceived that the Colchians would lose heart and be di-vided by the loss of their prince. Accordingly they sailed on ro the mouthof the Eridanus, a famous river commemorated in a constellation. It wasnear here that the Heliades, sisters of Phathon, were rransformed intopoplars, and their amber tears were carried offby the waters of the river.The Colchians were accustomed ro compare Apsyrtus to Phathon, theson of Helios, and call him by this name. Medea andJason's crime has allthe appearance of a ritual slaying equated with the myrhic death of theother.The river Eridanus is often identified wirh the fuver Po in modern ltaly,but Apollonius' description points to the other side of the Adriatic, thevast complex of islands on the shores of ancient lLlyria, modern Croatia.The Argonauts now laid low awhile on the Isle of Amber; as before theirstory is interwoven with legendary accounts of journeys on the ancienramber trade route. Since the Neolithic era the amber trade had traversedEurope, with amber from Jutland arriving by a combination of land andriver routes at the Adriatic for dispersal throughout the Mediterranean.As noted in Tbe True Grimoire there is every reason to suspect that tradi-tions concerning amber, rather than ambergris, are at7 influence on someof the goetic texts.8Z"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Here then the Argonauts took rcfuge, awaiting the dispersal of theColchian feet. Their pursuers had been told not to return empty handedand sought new homes for themselves, on the islands and in Illyria, ratherthan return to face the wrath of Aeetes. This rnay point to an identifica-tion of magical traditions associated with Colchis and the local traditionsof Illyrian tribes. A Colchian settlement is said to have been founded nearthe tomb of Cadmus, the grandfather of Dionysus, who gave Aeetes thedragon's teeth. Curiously the later Byzantine empire relocated Paulicianheretics from the region of ancient Colchis, first in Thrace and then inBosnia, where ancient funeral rites survived until the Middle Ages.Symbols from the cult of the Thracian hero survived on gravestones ofthis community.When the Argonauts departed the Isle of Amber, they had difficultymaking headway due to the numerous islets ahead of them. They tookrefuge at an obscure place referred to as the Hyllean coast. Here they be-stowed on the friendly locals a sacred tripod, which if buried would pre-serve the land from any invader. Mention is made of a king Hyllus who hadrecently died, whose father had once visited the Isle of Macris, the nurseof Dionysus, to obtain absolution for a frightful murder. The Argonautswere unaware that they could make no further Progress on their journeyuntil such absolution had been made for the death of Apsyrtus.Accordingly, the Argonauts departed and sailed far to the south. HereApollonius conceals his geographical knowledge; in order to preservethe authority of the inviolable but un-geographical Odyssey. Accordinglyhe has the Argonauts leave the string of Liburnian islands which theColchians had occupied behind them. They then continued on pastCorcyra, Melite and Cerossus and see the island of Nymphaa. This hetells us is the horne of the goddess Calypso; she had entertained Odysseusand her name may commemorate a connection with the Chalybes. ThenHera, knowing what ills laid in wait if they were not absolved of theircrime, intervened with a wind that blew them all the way back to the Isleof Amber. As they ran before the wind the beam of the oracular oak fromDodona which Athena had built into the ship spoke out. It announcedin direful tones the anger of Zeus, and that they were doomed to wander"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"endlessly over rempesruous seas unril Circe purged them of their guilt. Itbade Castor and Polydeuces - who men invoked as guardians from perilat sea - to beg rhe gods for access to the Italian Sea, where they would6nd her.From this point Apollonius is describing unknown rerrirory beyondsuch geographical knowledge as he or perhaps any Greek possessed. Hedescribes how the ship forged irs way up the river Eridanus, and confront-ed a spectacular scene. What greers them is the outfall of a huge, steaminglake where the son of the Sun-god Helios, Phathon, had fallen blazingfrom heaven. So too a nauseating stench arose from his gigantic remains,this is strongly reminiscent of the body of Python buried at Delphi,his very name is said ro mean rotting. While nor proven it is worthy ofnote that some commentators have suggested a connection also betweenPython and the awesome figure of Typhon, anorher buried god.His still burning body was the cause of perpetual clouds of vapour.Birds fying over the warers could nor make the other side and plungedfightless into the lake. Necromantic oracles situated at underworld lakeswere frequently described as'birdlesslwhile magical vapours are frequent-ly associated wirh necromanric caves and oracles, not least Delphi butalso various caves of Charon or Pluto. On the banks of the river were thedaughters of Helios, encased in rrees, bewailing their brother'.s fate andcryingtears of amber. It is a haunting scene as Apollonius describes it; thestench from the half consumed god, the loud lamenting of his sisrers, area physical presence in the story. The emphasis is utterly undersrandable,and an examination of the context is clearly required.PhcethonThe legend of Phathon the son of Helios and the nymph Clymene hasbeen little examined by occultists, although his fall from heaven and otherelements of his myth connecr him with important Luciferean themes.His name figures fairly largely in the Argonautica, in the first place as apet-name for Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, both of whom are also related toHelios, and secondarlly in his own right as a mythological figure alluded89"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"to at various points. As a rotting corPse emitting magical vapours, he re-sembles the similarly named Python at Delphi, He is also at the same timean oracular hero and a mystery god comparable to Dionysus. Additionally,as a murder victim denied marriage and children his was a type of ghostsuitable for evocation in necromantic rites.There are variant forms of his myth; one is of a handsome youth belovedby the goddess Aphrodite, who rewarded him with the care of one of hertemples in Syria.In this form he is an ancestor of Adonis, another impor-tant figure who is a doomed beautiful youth. This Phathon is the son ofEos, the Titan goddess of the dawn who was sister to Helios and Selene.Although a variant myrh this still places him in the family of Helios, andof Titanic race. His father in this myth is Cephaius, a mortal man.The more usual form in which he is son of Helios and Clymene is moreimportant here. Clym efle, a sea nymph, must be considercd; for the vari-ants of her myth are important. In some she is the mother of Prometheus,in others his wife, while also said to be the wife of Helios. It appears tome ro be idle to attempt to distinguish the Clymene of these myths fromone another as while other Clymenes are to be found, the Clymene inthese parricular variants is plainly identified as an Oceanid. Part of thisconfusion may instead be due to the nymph Rhode, from which Rhodestakes its name also, being given the name of her daughter Clymene. Inthis case it is Rhode who is mother of Phathon and bride of the Sun. Theproximity of Rhodes to Syria underlines the connections of both formsof the myrh to Middle Eastern cults. The inter-relation of Prometheusand Helios through Clymene is very interesting in either case. Both aremajor frgures in the Argonautica, and Hephastus is important in relationto each of them. Given the connection of both with fire, it should be bornin mind that the fire-working magicians, the Telchines, also originate onthe island of Rhodes.A curious figure arises in the myth as a friend of Phathon; this isEpaphus the son of Zeus and Io. Epaphus was born on the river Nileand became the king of Egyp, married to a daughter of the Nile namedMemphis, after whom he named the city he built. He was in turn the father"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"HOMEWARD BOTINI)of a daughter named Libya from which Africa took its name. Evidently afusion of Greek mythology with Egyptian geography is at play here.According to the myrh, Phathon became vain and was raunted byEpaphus with accusarions of mortal parenrage. Insulted he came to hisfather Helios - who it will be recalled was a Sun-god long before Apolloclaimed that privileged status - to beg a favour proving his divinity.The generosity of the father was such that he granted the favour beforePhathon named it. His son then asked the right to drive the chariot ofHelios through the heavens. Helios foreseeing inevitable disaster tried todissuade him, speaking of the danger and the improprie ty if he undertookthe task. The monstrous forms of the zodiacal signs to be encountered onthe journey arc an important feature of the warning. Phathon howeverwould not be dissuaded and Helios had sworn the inviolable oath of thegods upon the Styx. Consequently Phathon took the reins of rhe chariotand made the attempt, but the horses would not be guided by him andstrayed too near the earth, causing blasting heat and threatening a uni,versal conflagration.Zeus, seeing the danger, struck Phathon dead with athunderbolt so that he plunged into the river Eridanus.on the banks of the river the sisters of Phathon, called the Heliadesor Phathontiades, mourned his loss. Their tears fowed so inconsolablythat Zeus or the gods in their compassion turned them into poplar rreeson the bank, and their tears became amber carciedby the river ro the sea.There are differing versions of rheir names: Lampetie, Phathusa andLampethusa; or according to Hyginusr Merope, Helie, Aegle, Lampetie,Phoebe, Aetheria and Dioxippe; Germanicus menrions nine, as if incomparison to the Muses: Merope, Helie, Aegle, Aegiale, Phoebe, Petre,Charie, Arethusa and Dioxippe. The title of Heliades belongs particu-larly to Phrthusa, Lampetie and Phoebe. Some details of their attributesare given in Apollonius' description, suggesring images reminiscent of theChurch sibyls: Phathusa bearing a silver crook, Lampetie a staff of shin-ing copper.Another mourner at the riverside was rhe Ligurian king Cycnus, a kins-man of Phathon. His mourning was so plaintive and his voice - givenhim by Apollo - was so sweer that he was transformed into a swan. It is"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"from this myth that we derive the phrase swan song, said to be sung beforea swan dies, euokingin a mournful tone.The chariot of Helios, the Heliadesand Cycnus are all commemorated in constellations.These mythological details are the most widely received but their basisis in much older ritual. The fact is that other authors use Phathon as atitle of the Sun, its interpretation being shining (a similar term is alsoused of Jupiter). The fall from the chariot is reminiscent of incidents inthe myth of Pelops, and of course Empedocles. The foremost cult centreof Helios was at Rhodes, where was anciently celebrated a spectacularsacrifice of a chariot and four horses which were caused to plunge intothe sea. Walter Burkert is inclined to link this with the myth of Phathon,and it is difficult to disagree with him. The names Hyperion (he who goesbefore) and Phath on (brlght, or shining) were originally epithets of Helioshimselt they became separate personalities in later Greek myth, becom-ing his father and son respectively.While not mentioned by Homer or Hesiod,Iater writers describe thenight-time passage of Helios from West to East in a golden cup, a formof boat fashioned by Hephastus, whose reladonship with Helios is quitemarked in the Argonautica. This passage through the night is strikinglysimilar to Egyptian ideas regarding the boat of Ra. This nocturnal sun isa sign too that Helios is not without a chthonic role, comparable with thesolar-chthonic heroes of Thracian cults, while the tup' - his boat of thenight - resembles the libation bowl central to Thracian and Orphic ritual.The chariot and horses, surely an ancient part of the non-Olympian cult,are also not described by Homer, and 6rst appear in the Homeric Llymns.The horses are named in later sources as Pyrios, Euos, Aethon andPhlegon, or as Euos, Aethiops, Bronte and Sterope. The latter two namesare very close to two of the Cyclops, assistants of Hephastusr Brontes,Arges and Steropes. This is far from being the only linkage we have seenbetween these two gods. The sacrifices to Helios included white rams,boars, bulls, goats and lambs, but particularly white horses and honey.The Argonauts emerged from their inland riverjourney at the mouth ofthe Rhone. Apollonius assures us that this journey was made possible byCastor and Polydeuces, and gives this as the reason for their being hon-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"HOMEWARD BOUNDoured with altars and rituals; even rhough, as he tells us, this was not rheonly journey where their role of saviours of mariners was demonstrated.This of course was a fulfilment of the oracle the oaken beam from Dodonahad made.It is likely their role here is a deliberate prelude to rhe expiationof guilt by the sorceress Circe; the twins as it were, are lighting the rirual6re. For this reason another glance at the Dioscuri (first examined in BookFour), is a fitting preliminary ro rhis event.Tbe DioscuriThe antiquity of the Dioscuri in Indo-European tradition is demonstrat-ed by their precise analogues in the Rrg Wda, the Asvin; who are horse-men, heroes and prorectors. While their farher in Greek myrh is Zeus,the vedic Asvin are children of the Sun; who at Rhodes, Corinrh andColchis was called Helios. The Dioscuri as such were pre-eminentlyworshipped in Sparra, and later Rome where they were known as rheGemini or Castores, but they were widely honoured elsewhere. In addi-tion very similar figures, under different names, were honoured in otherstates, Messenia had the warrior brothers, Idas and Lynceus, who wereArgonauts like the Dioscuri.The Theban twins, also sons of Zeus and associated with horses, werenamed Zethos and Amphion. According to the classical myth, Zeus hadfathered them on Antiope, who was imprisoned by the orders of her hus-band's second wife, Dirce. she escaped when near her rerm, and fed toMount Cithaeron, where according to Nonnus she gave birth to the twinsat a crossroads. They were subsequently raised by a shepherd and kept ig-norant of their parentage. Amphion was given alyreby Hermes (compareMarsyas) and practiced song and music while his brother spent his timehunting and guarding the flocks. They learned the truth of their birthand returned to Thebes, where the ruler Lycus, had given Antiope to hiswife Dirce, a daught er of Helios, who treated their mother cruelly. Thebrothers killed them both, Dirce they slew by rying her to the horns ofa bull, a fate she had planned for Antiope. According ro some accounrsthey then threw her in a spring which afterwards bore her name. They"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"then fortifred Thebes, Amphion playing his lyre enchanted the stones sothat they moved of their own accord (compare Orpheus). After these featsAmphion was married to Niobe, a nymph with various associations withCybele the Mountain Mother.Notable in this myth, which contains numerous subtexts, is the rescueof their mother by the twins; comparable to the fescue by the Dioscuriof their sister Helen. Their birth at a crossroads, a detail preserved byNonnus in his epic Dionysiaca, probably rePresents the Roman integta'tion of rhe Dioscuri with the Lares. A funerary votive relief from Lebadeia,home of the Oracle of Trophonios, is worth mentioning in this connec-tion. Probably from the early Hellenistic period, it shows an initiate of hercult being presented to Cybele (identifred by a fanking lion and throne).He is led by the hand by Persephone, who bears akey; immediately be-hind her stands Dionysus, then Pan. Behind these is a female figure beaping two torches, this 6gure is likely to rePresent Hecate. Behind her is amature male figure bearing a horn of plenty and flanked by snakes; he iseither tophonios of Zeus Meilichios, if indeed a distinction was drawnbetween them in the local cult. Finally aPPear three Curetes with theirshields and behind them the Dioscuri in pointed caps. The family of thedeceased are represented as far smaller, and stand in front of the Dioscuri;it is interesting to note that the deceased, an initiate, is represented equalin size to the gods, having achieved the status of a hero with their ownfunerary cult. The whole illustrates that in the Greek mind these variedchthonic gods were interconnected in the rites and Mysteries of the time.Long before this period the myth of Zethos and Amphion was alreadypowerfully linked to the Dionysian theme; Dirce is said to have been adevotee of Dionysus, and he avenged her by driving Antiope mad, andcaused a spring to appear at the site of Dirce's death. There werc aPPar'ently two springs associated with her, one flowed past Thebes, the otherwas on Mount Cithaeron. It is not without relevance that Polydeuces'name means much sweet wine; the name is a clear reference to ritual usage,reminiscent of male initiations on Lemnos. In addition of course figuressuch as the Curetes were connected to the birth of Dionysus and the cel-ebration of his Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"HOMEWARI) BOUNDIt is important to note that Dirce, whose name means double or cleft, isthought to be the same as Dercetis or Derceto, This is an alternative nameof the Syrian goddess Atargatis, whose cult resembled or connected withthose of Astarte and Astaroth. She was often represented as a beautifulwoman above the waist, while the lower part had the form of a fish. Therewas also a spring in Spain, whose waters were said to be uncommonlycold, which bore the name Derce. The spring of Dirce was doubtless im-portant in the rituals of ancient Thebes long prior to the classical mythaccounting for them. We should not suppose that any historical'wickedstepmother'gave it its name. It would be highly unwise also to interpretthe myth in terms of religious confict of the Orphic versus Dionysiantype, or in any other historical fashion. The whole basis of the myth in-volved ritual.The rituals of the Dioscuri and similar figures were intimately connect-ed with initiations involving secret societies of warriors, both Greek andRoman, particularly cavalry.The Roman equites (knights) held equestrianparades in honour of the Dioscuri, and practiced secret initiations. Therites of the Dioscuri were often nocrurnal, the leader of the Theban cav-alry was the only person to know the whereabouts of Dirce's grave. Uponretirement he met secretly with his successor at night and they performedsacrifrces in her honour without the use of frre, and removed all trace oftheir actions before dawn.Young Spartan warriors also performed nocturnal rites, offering a dogin the temple of Phoebe, a female figure from the myth of the Dioscuri, asDirce is in the Theban myth of Zethos and Amphion. The Theban prac-tice however is most instructive, the outgoing officer equares fairly naru-rally with Castor, and the younger man with Polydeuces. The connectionof the superior twin with music and the younger with greater activity alsomakes sense in terms of a hierarchal structure within a secret society ofwarriors. The imparting of knowledge to the young men by elders in sucha society through sacred songs is completely natural in such a conrexr. Iris significant too that with the passage of time in such societies the youthbecomes at alater stage the elder, so that the twin polarities are united inhim."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"This is illustrated also in astrological symbolism where the Dioscuri arerepresented in the constellation Gemini, of which the two brightest starsbear their names. Castor rises with the r9'h degree of Cancer and Polluxwith the zz\"d degree. The word Gemini, meaning twins, was one of theirtitles among the Romans, who also rcferced to them as the Castores. Theemployment of these stars in ritual magicbears very close relation to theirmythology. Of the two brothers Polydeuces was immortal and his brothermortal; when Castor was slain Polydeuces was given the choice of liv-ing always as an immortal on Olympus or giving half his immortality tohis brother so they could divide their time between Olympus and Hades.Polydeuces chose the latter, and the two thereafter alternated between therealm of the dead and the realm of the gods. The rising and setting ofthese stars has similar significance to the Morning and Evening Stars.Interestingly, although Polydeuces was the immortal twin, his star,Pollux, is seen as malefrc and connected with evening and the dark. By thesame token Castor is seen as benefic and connected with the morning andthe light. Astrological magicians desiring the benefits of Castor's infu-ence invoke him when his star is rising, but only while Pollux is still belowthe horizon (in the underworld). When the influence of Polydeuces is re-quired he is invoked in the evening, after the star of his brother has set, thatis when it has entered the underworld. His nature, when badly aspected,connected to Ascendant or Midheaven or to the luminaries, is consideredbrutal, tyrannical,, cruel and violent; his brother by the same token confersgood nature and elevated morals and manners. The background of theobservational star lore described above reflects the Chaldean connectionsof Greek astrology, for in Babylon the two stars were also seen as apafu, theherdsman and the wanior, just as the Phoenicians first saw them as protec-tors at sea. Despite their Vedic origins, the Dioscuri as we inherit themare a composite of Greek and Middle Eastern tradition.An important feature of their cult was that they were honoured as im-mortals with the same burned offerings as Olympians, and also with thelibations proper to heroes and the dead. Votive reliefs to the Dioscuri of-ten employed symbols of twinhood. Besides the dokana these could con-sist of two amphorae, shields, or snakes. The Spartans saw the pear treeg6"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"as sacred to Castor and Polydeuces, and hung such votive images in itsbranches.Classical invocations of Castor and Pollux were unique in involvinga table laden with food ar rhe home of the individual or family makingthe offering. This was called the theoxenia or god-entertaining rite, andwas proper to the Dioscuri alone. A table was spread, a couch with twocushions prepared and rwo amphora, thought to have been filled withpanspermia, a mixture of many grains, placed for thern. Votive reliefs showthe twins riding through the air to the feast; others show twin snakes curl-ing around the amphorae. After a suitable interval the human participantsfeast in their honour.In rerurn the Dioscuri protected the celebrants.Such offerings could be made at the public hearth of a city,but this sim-ply mirrored the domestic cult. In this way the Dioscuri resemble varioushousehold gods to be discussed in a later chapter. The cult of the Dioscurior Castores survived long after the official sanctioning of Christianity, andthe Church endeavoured to substitute saints in their place. Of particularinterest in this respect are Saints Cosmas and Damian, who were substi-tuted for them in their capacity of healers. In Santeria these saints are themasks of the Ibeyi, divine twins who are children of Chango, an impor-tant Orisha who wields thunder in the form of an axe, curiously reminis-cent of the thunderbolt wielding Zeus who was the father of the Dioscuri.Interestingly, a favoured ofFering for the Ibeyi, who are also healers, is rohold a childrens party in their honour, reminiscent of the theoxenia.To summarise then, the Dioscuri represent officers of archaic secretsocieties central to many themes in the history of goetia and ecstaticreli-gion. They are connected with chthonic and nocturnal rites; being guidesand protectors in the Mysteries and in the perils of everyday life, Theycame to be associated with the crossroads, an archerypal site for the prac-tice of magic; an association which is completely natural to twin figureswho are representatives at once of the celestial and the chthonic realms,of light and darkness, dearh and immo rality. They are, frnally, associatedin myth and ritual with goddesses cenrral to rhe Mysteries such as Cybeleand Demeter, and - through Dirce - with Astaroth, whose importance inritual magic requires no underlining."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Aea and CirceTo return to the narrative of the Argonauts; having emerged from theirriverine adventures with the assistance of the Dioscuri, shortly thereafterthe Argo came to the island of Aea. This island is variously placed, andlike the island of Nymphae is called the home of Calypso in ancient writ-ings. So roo rhe name represents the island of Circe, and is connected withher Colchian origins as sister of Aeetes. The Argonauts bring the Argointo the harbour, wherer... from the ship they ca$t hawsers to the shore near at hand. And herethey found Circe bathing her head in the salt sea-{pray, for sorely hadshe been scared by visions of the night. Her chambers and all the wallsof her palace seemed to be running with blood, and flame was devour-ing all the magic herbs with which she used to bewitch Strangers whocame thence; and she herself quenched the glowing Ilame with a mur-derer's blood, drawing it up in her hands; and she ceased from deadlyfear. Wherefore when morning came she rose, and with sea-5pray wasbathing her hair and her garments.Circe is engaged on their arrivalin a traditional purification rite performedin the aftermath of a nightmare. While unaware of it, she is clearly haunt-ed by the horrors of the crime she is to expiate on behalf of Medea andJason - perhaps even haunted by the ghost of her kinsman Apsyrtus. Ourfirst glimpse of her in the epic reminds us immediately that she is a power-ful sorceress, and like Medea is a pharmakos who works her magic withpowerful drugs. While repellent substances were employed in magic, mur'derers blood is an example of literary elaboration; the precedent of someof the noxious ingredients enumerated by the witches in the Scottish play.Circe's purifications of course might also be performed prior to expiationrituals such as she is soon to perform. Next, we are told of the strange reti-nue that accompanies her, substituting for the men turned into animals inHomer's account of her:g8"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"And beasts, not resembling rn. o\";:;\" wild, nor yet like men inbody, bur with a medley of limbs, went in a throng, as sheep from rhefold in multitudes follow rhe shepherd.

As will be seen later in this sixth book, manyhousehold gods and spirits were associated with the hearth. In fact thetwo centres of domestic Greek religion were the hearth and the grave,and the customs relating to these are both important in the history ofgoeric magic. These domestic traditions are the root and core of the laterdevelopment of religious practice on a civic and national level. The earli-est temples were hearth houses and date to the 8'h century, the treasurytemples with which we are familiar from the classical period were a laterdevelopment. Even after this shrines such as Delphi remained the hearthof Greece, the source of sacred fire to renew those elsewhere after times ofcrisis and war. The sanctity of the hearth explains many features of Greektradition, including its role as sanctuary for suppliants as here in the homeof Circe. This sanctuary could be claimed by strangers as well as kinsfolk.So too the virginity of the goddess Hestia, and of the Vestal virgins, laysin the necessity of ritual purity applied to the fire. A death in the houserequired rhe extinguishing of the fire and its renewal from a sacred source.So too the immoveable nature of the hearth explains why Hestia playslittle role in Greek mythology despite being one of the Twelve Olympians.Her image never took part in processions, and generally retained a moreprimitive form, in which separated legs, and evenfeegwere generally absent.Medea hid her face in both her hands, butJason fixed in the ground themighty hilted sword with which he had slain Aeetes'son; nor did theyraise their eyes to meet her look.

Whereforeinrever'ence to the ordinance of Zeus the god of suppliants, who is a vengefulgod yet succours the guilty, she began to off-er the sacrifice with whichruthless suppliants are cleansed from guilt when they approach the al-tar. Firft, to atone for the murder Still unexpiated, she held above theirheads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the fruit of thewomb, and, severing its neck, $rinkled their hands with the blood;and again she made propitiation with other drink olferings, calling onZeus the Cleanser, the protedtor of murder-stained suppliants."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Regardless of the appeal to rhe ordinance s of Zeus, the expiarory offer-ing of a sow is in all respects a chthonic ritual. Washing the hands of thesuppliants in this sacred blood is an act of salvation, of washing away sin,as much magical as religious. Circe not only expiates the crime of murder- all the more awfui in that Medea played a part in the murder of herown brother - she also effectively lays the ghost, and nor dissimilar ritescould equally call them forth. The ghost of Phuthon is of course one whodied by violence, who were doomed to have no rest unless or until beingconjured professionally. He embodies the spirit to be conjured,just as thisaction defines Circe as a necromancer.In this role, she is a death goddess,a very Persephone or Astaroth, the parron of the art and its tutor. As wellshe might be, since rhe performance ofjust such rituals by female mourn-ers begot goeria in the first place.A11 the necessary associations can be grasped in an instant by the visualsense.

Her shrieks can invoke vengeance, because as a Fury she embod-ies it.

Naturally Apollonius does not de-tain us with such details. As a commentator I,like the Naiades, have lessertasks to perform than addressing an epic poem ro the sophisdcated gen,tlemen of the Alexandrian library. So I shall tell you about the Naiades,as befits my station."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":")PHIAThe Naiades, nymphs of fountains, springs, rivers and wells, were lesserdeities in their own right. They dwelled in and around the water sourc-es associated with them, and are essentially indistinguishable from theUndines of later occultism. They are generally depicted as young andbeautiful virgins, frequently leaning upon an urn from which water fows.Receiving great veneration , and regarded as the source of oracles, posses-sion and ritual ecstasy, their sacrifices consisted of lambs and goats, at-tended by libations of wine, honey and oil. Simpler ofFerings were alsomade, of milk, fruit and flowers.That Circe is attended by these lesser deities is deeply significanU whileit prefigures the attendance of familiar spirits upon the archetypal witch -as the female attendants of Medea prefigure the coven - there is no doubtthat it also powerfully underlines Circe's status as a goddess. It is as suchthat Homer describes her in the Odyssey. There he depicts her dwelling ina stone built house in the middle of a clearing, surrounded by dense for-est. Instead of the earth born monsters described by Apollonius, Homerdescribes this house as surrounded by wolves and lions. These were notsavage but fawned upon any men who approached, for they were menthemselves, transformed by Circe's magic,Circe's magical work continues in their absencerAnd within, Circe, Standing by the hearth, kept burning atonement-cakes without wine, praying the while that she might Stay from theirwrath the terrible Furies, and that Zeus himself rnight be propitiousand gentle to them both, whether with hands Stained by the blood of adtranger or, as kinsfolk, by the blood of a kinsman, they should implorehis grace.The wineless oflering is a well esrablished chthonic rite, associated withboth the Furies and with older forms of Dionysus, or indeed Aristaus.The cakes too are a frequent part of rites of the dead, or of Hecate andCerberus, with parallels in Vedic times. These oflerings were likely per-formed with averted gaze."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Such ritual actions at the hearth were part of the household cults thatpreceded those of the polis. The hearth was the centre of the household,and the sacred laws of hospitality also revolved around it. Guests, be theystrangers or more familiar persons, effectively claimed sancruary at thehearth as sacred place. The hearth was the place of Hestia, Vesta to theRomans, who was central first to the home, only later to the city-state orEmpire. The male head of the household is both priest and the paradigmof Father Zeus, whose role in relation to suppliants in these prayers re-flects the relations of the householder to the guest. This was by no meanshis only name however, gods of 6re had equal claim.Here Circe acts as priestess of her own home; her mythic form a frregoddess, her earthly form an important female of a household cult. Thisrole reminds us that Hera - the Mother - is Jasons patron in the epic.The Mother of the gods is a very complex figure, likely subsuming manydisparate regional traditions. Although the pastiche of her in Homer dis-courages excess effort at rehabilitation in this study, she certainly has aplace here. Circe may be enacting these riruals in her honour, or as herrepresentative. If so let us imagine an archaic form of Hera Akrea, withher ancient Corinthian temple linking her to the same traditions asHelios, Medea and Melissa.The essential expiatory rite performed , Circe is able to seat her guestsin chairs of honour, and ask for news and an account of their adventures.For the {irst time Medea lifts her gaze (the time for averting the gaze andfor raising the head, for silence and for speech, are required body Ianguage,custom and ritual), and Apollonius speaks of the power residing in theeyes of Children of the Sun, emitting golden rays of fashing light. Laterin their adventures Medea wields the famous evil eye, perhaps for the firsttime in the literary record; the connection of this malign power rvith thatof the Sun is worthy of note.Medea gives a limited account of their adventures, the quest of theArgonauts and her flight with them from Colchis, omitting to mention themurder.

Introducing these asswiftly as may be; Hera despatches her messenget winged Iris, to sum-mon Thetis to her presence.

Zeus'only abandoned this desire when informed of the se-cret thatThetis was destined by fateto bear a son of greater than his father.A child of promise, whose coming had been the secret Prometheus with-held in defiance of Zeus throughout his torture. Aeschylus' PrometheusBound gives us a truly Luciferian epiphany in expressing the grandeur andnobility of Prometheus' defiance.According to the regular story Zeus, fearing dethronernent as he haddethroned Chronos, desisted from pursuit of Thetis, who bore Achillesto mortal Peleus. At this point of the epic, in the chronology of myth,Achilles was being rearcdby Chiron the centaur, while Peleus was amongthe Argonauts. So too Hera foretells that when Achilles comes to theElysian Fields, he shall there maffy Medea. It is difficult not to see inthis outcome a fulfilment of the fate of Zeus to be dethroned by a songreater than his Jather.The Father, Hades or Zeus, carries off the maiden;it is a youthful hero, whether Achilles orJason or a Thracian divine kingon the Dionysian model, who wins the hand of the daughter - a Helen,Medea or Melissa - exernplified by Persephone. Such an outcome is itselfto be expected, and Apollonius withholds their union from us only a littlelonger.Thetis next did as instructed by Hera and visited her mortal husbandPeleus, the father of Achilles with a message for the Argonauts.

By this process she would have conferred immortality uponlrim; instead, enraged at Peleus crying out, she abandoned their home andreturned to the sea. Remorseful and dazed at seeing Thetis again, whenshe had gone Peleus passed her instructions to his comrades.The gentle wind Hera had arranged for them bore them swiftly on, un-til they came near the island of Anthemoessa (west of Naples: Ischia orCapri).Tbe SircnsOn the island of Anthemoessa lived the Sirens, monstrous birds with theheads of women whose singing lures mariners to their doom. According toApollonius, these were the daughters of the river god Achelous, borne tohim by the Muse Terpsichore. Although there are several variants of theirparentage, one in particular is worth examining. As daughters of the seagod Phorcys, they are sisters of the Graeae and the Gorgons, and of theserpent and nymphs who guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides.We first met the Sirens when discussing the transposing of theUnderworld journey to the starry sky in the Vision of Er. Under apparentPythagorean infuence, Plato made them guardians of the Eight Spheres:those of the Fixed Stars and the Seven Planets. In this context the'mu-sic of the spheres' is their song. Now, at one time, there were two Sirenswith the delightfully'barbaric' names of Aglaopheme (lovely speech) orHimorepa (gentle voice) and Thelx iepia (enchanting speecb),Larer accountsincrease this to three, some adding Peisinoe Qtersuasiue) to the two above;Apollodorus mentions Peisinoe playing the Lyre, Aglaopheme - who hecalls Aglaope - singing and Thelxiepia accompanying them on the flute;an alternate listing gives: Parthenop e (maiden voice), Ligeia (sbrill) andLeucosia (white).There is also a group of four: Thelxiepeia, Aglaopheme,Peisinoe and Molp e (song).This gives us a list of eight names, as if await-ing attribution to the spheres of Plato's apocalypse by a contemporary my-thographer.

Their connecrion wirhsinging predates their transformation, for as our wrirer informs us, rheyused to sing to Persephone in chorus. According ro myrh, Demeter rrans-formed them into birds. This was either in punishmenr for the loss ofPersephone, or to aid in the search for her. The birdlike form was veryfrequent in funerary monuments, and even amonggrave goods, This sug-gests a benign psychopompic role outside of myth.There is a narural asso-ciation of these ideas with the magical singing of dirges. When combinedwith winged beings presiding over the Spheres, an imaginative magicianmight see the outlines of an ascent ritual.The resemblance of rhe Sirens to the small birdlike human figures com-monly used to represent ghosts in Greek art is more than coincidental.Infact, both ghosts and Sirens share iconographic details with the Erinyesor Furies. While their original form was birdlike with a human head, theoldest examples are bearded; but throughout mythology and in most rep-resentations they arc female, Later this appearance gives way to womenwith fish tails, resembling a mermaid.

The latter, it is relevant to remind the reader, wasa notable devotee of Hecate. Other forms of the name are: Persephassa,Phersephassa, Persephatta, Phersephatta, Pherephatta and Phersephonia.The Roman form was Proserpina and some features of her cult in Italy,and particularly in Sicily, are prior ro the Classical influence.The name or rather title, Kore, meaning the daughter (of Demeter) wasadopted in Attica after the founding of the Eleusian Mysteries; the twowere frequentLy rcferred to as Mother and Daughter (the Greek for moth-er being Meter). However, in the Homeric epics there is no rrace whateverof her being considered the daughter of Demeter. Nor is there any trace ofher being considered in any sense a kindly goddess. Homer describes hersimply as the wife of Hades, and she bears epithets which mean exceed-ingly awesome or dreaded (Epaine) and uenerable (Agayn, Agne).The myth of her abduction by Hades first appears in Hesiod, while forHomer her abode akeady was in the underworld and she had no connec-tion with the regeneration of vegetation in Spring. That the abductionmay have been feigned as part of a marriage ritual is a not unlikely sugges-tion.

Since theybear all the signs of great antiquity it is more likely that these elements areignored in aristocratic epics. Nevertheless her agrarian role is not of par-ticular importance for this discussion, so will be no further enlarged upon.As the Queen of the LJnderworld it was believed no-one could die unlessPersephone or her minister Atropos cut off a hair of their head, whichmyth may originate as an explanation of the custom of cutting hair fromthe body and strewing it outside the door as an offering to the goddess.A point concerning her that is of direct, even central relevance to ourstudy is her role as first mother of Dionysus. In this Orphic version of hismyth Dionysus was slain by the Titans, who were then destroyed by thethunderbolts of his father Zeus. Humanity was formed from the sootysmoke arising from their bodies, and thus inherited the guilt of the Titansas a form of original sin. This guilt was expiated by the ascetic practices ofOrphism, and also by the famous Initiation of the Dead which was the ritePlato mentioned in his important reference to Goetia. By such means theforgiveness of Persephone for her son's murder was earned for the dead,and a place in the Isles of the Blessed obtained.

F{era had foreseen this and her intervention savesthem, arranging for Nereids ro carry the ship safely pasr. Hephastus -whose forge lies nearby the scene * witnesses their adventure; he rested onthe haft of his great hammer to observe the momenrous occasion. It canbe no accident that Apollonius inrroduces him so regularly into the tale.The adventure of the Wandering Rocks is another nod to the geogra-phy of the Odyssey. Here the Argonauts, like Odysseus before rhem, con-front the monsters Scylla and Charybdis, personificarions of dangerousrocks and a deadly whirlpool. The myrh of Scylla is particularly interest-ing, due particularly to the presence in it of both Typhon and of Circe, andbears rcpeating here. Scylla was once a beautiful nymph, though srrangeto say a daughter of Typhon (or as others say, of Phorcys, as describedin the account of the Sirens). The sea god Glaucus loved her, and whenshe resisted him, he sought the aid of Circe; whose fame with herbs andincantations was universal. Circe however fell in love with him herself, andtried to banish Scylla from his mind, withour success. Circe then pun-ished her rival by enchanting the fountain where she bathed with magicalherbs. Scylla was transformed into a frightful monsrer; below her waistsprang a mass of doglike crearures, which barked incessantly and stoodupon twelve legs. Above sprang further monstrous transformations, sixdifferent heads, each with three rows of teeth. Appalled, she hurled herselfinto the sea; there she was instantly transformed into deadly rocks besidethe whirlpool of Chaybdis.Fronting the Ionian gulf there lies an island in the Ceraunian sea, richin soil, with a harbour on both sides, Beneath whicl-r lies the sickle, aslegend saith - grant me grace, O Muses, not willingly do I tell thistale of olden days - wherewith Cronos pitilessly mutilated his father.Others call it the reaping-hook of Demetea goddess of the nether"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"world.

Tothem came Argo, held fa$t by many toils, borne by the breezes fromthe Thrinacian sea; and Alcinous and his people with kindly sacrificegladly welcomed their coming.In the same passage that Apollonius asks the Muses'indulgence for hisunwilling recounting of the tale of old time, we encounter Macris, thenurse of Dionysus. This concatenation of attitudes and themes is notmerely incidental. The sickle of Kronos is a familiar motif,, while less wellknown is attribution of the same instrument to chthonic goddesses suchas Demeter, goddess of the netberworld. In Book Four, I mentioned themanufacture of this weapon by the Telchines, its association with ArtemisOrthia, and its historical use by the Chalybes, associated with Cybele inher pre-Classical guise. It is also interesting to note that the Chalybeswere, so to speak, castrators rather than castratos. While a sophisticatedHellene like our author obviously feels ambivalent regarding some bar-baric traditions, he is simultaneously passionate about the Mysteries theyrepresent, albeit in Orphic guise.An important aspect of the Mysteries is undoubtedly the mystical.mar-riage, which has a mythic prototype in the marfiage ofJason & Medea.Here, on the island of Phaeacia, is where it takes place. Some of theirColchian pursuers arriving on the island, they arc in grave danger; butboth parties are guests of Alcinous and he has authority in the matter. Inthe story, his wife Arete takes pity on Medea and influences his decision.He tells the Colchians that if Medea is still a virgin they may take herback to her father, but that otherwise he must find for Jason as her hus-band. This is infact a fix, as Medea is informed of this decision in advanceand arrangements for the marriage are made in haste. Since the marriagerather than the ancient rights of fathers and husbands is what concerns us,it is to that subject we now turn. I shall let the epic poet describe the scene:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"HOIVIEWARD BOUNI)And ftraightway they mingled a bowl to the blessed ones, as is right,and reverently led sheep to the altar, and for that very night preparedfor the maiden the bridal couch in the sacred cave, where once dweltMacris, the daughter of Ari$taeus, lord of honey, who discovered theworks of bees and the fatness of the olive, the fruit of labour ... Thereat that time did they fpread a mighty couch; and thereon they laid theglittering fleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made honouredand the theme of song. And for them nymphs gathered fowers of var-ied hue and bore them thither in their white bosoms; and a Splendouras of flame played round them all, such a light gleamed from the goldentufts ... That cave is to this day called the sacred cave of Medea, wherethey Spread the fine and fragrant linen and brought these two together.While in the context of the story in modern eyes this is reminiscent ofa marriage of convenience to avert deportation, the cave and other de-tails evidently give it a deeper significance at the same time. An importantfeature of the Dionysian rites was a mystical marciage; the most fteelydiscussed occurrence of the motif in all Greek religion, yet curiously theonly one not referred to as hieros gamos. In Athens and Attica, whereMycenaean survivals are not unlikely, the wife of the archon was marriedto the god for the occasion. The title of king(basileus) and queen was re-tained in these rites despite democratic rule in Athens.In the MycenaeanLinear B texts the title of basileus is not a title of a ruler, but of a guildmaster, and in particular the master of the guild of smiths. It is tempting tosee in this a connection between Dionysian cults and the religio-politicalstatus of smiths in Hittite culture. The fery epiphanies of Dionysus in theBacchre of Euripides lend circumstantial weight to such an identification.In any case, Medea andJason here are certainly taking magico-religiousroles; they are living embodiments of a god and goddess united in a deeplysignificant manner, whether productive of fertility or with some later met-aphorical significance overlaid. On one model, the superior partner hereis a female deity. Such a marriage affirmed the status of a Thracian stylehero-king, who was subsequently deified in the afterlife. On another,thefemale paftner is the mortal wife of an equally mortal basileus, simulta-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"neously married to a god, Dionysus. However, there is in many respectslittle real difference between the two. What is important is that the divinestatus of Medea, and the cult significance of much of the srory, is plainlyunderlined. The Colchians accepr the fait accompli and the srory moveson, but other significant details arise before our heroes depart:And ftill the altars which Medea built on rhe Spot sacred to Apollo,god of shepherds, receive yearly sacrifices in honour of the Fares andthe Nymphs. And when the Minyae departed many gifts of friend,ship did Alcinous beftow and many Arete; moreover she gave Medeatwelve Phaeacian handmaids from the palace, ro bear her company.The significance of the pasroral Apollo is evident, and the sacrifice roFates and Nymphs has relevance ro our theme. The twelve maidens, whoclearly substitute for Medea's former attendants as priestess of Hecat e, arean artifrcial way of maintaining a canonical presence. A resemblance to acoven of witches is an obvious inference, but in this ancient conrext whatwould they representi The number of the Olympians is a ready associa,tion, and the maidens may embody a solar or lunar zodiac surroundingthe goddess in pantheistic mode.And on the seventh day they left Drepane; and at dawn came a freshbreeze from Zeus.

A north erly gale blew them offcourse, sweeping the Argo sourhwards into the gulf of Libyan Syrtis fromwhich no ship can escape. A high tide beached the ship in a ghostly mist-swept desert landscape, devoid of warer or human habitation. The helms-man Ancaeus made clear their desperate plight, no escape by sea was pos-sible from that place , and yet surviving there was equally impossible. TheArgonauts despaired and laid down some disrance apaft., gathering their"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"HOME\\VARD BOUNDcloaks over their heads to await a miserable death. Meanwhile the maids ofMedea gathered around her and began a piteous dirge. Yet all was not losr:.. . the heroine-nymphs, warders of Libya, had pity on them, they whoonce found Athena, what time she leapt in gleaming armour from herfather's head, and bathed her by Triton's waters.Apollonius does not tell us if these nymphs matched Medea's attendantsin number. However, he did introduce this stage of thejourney with them;and has now mentioned them again immediately before the Libyan ward-ers appear. These nymphs are of course likely to resemble Libyan priest-esses, and are associated in the Greek mind with the goddess Athena.If there is such a connection it is likely to be of great age, and Athenawould have been quite different from the unassailable political goddess ofAthens. There may even be a connection between Athena and the Libyansibyl as well as older goddesses of whom Lamia is likely a recollection. Thelater connections of Libya and Greece concern the founding of Cyrene,which is an element in the Argonauts tale. The Oracle of Ammon at Siwa,which is connected with the Libyan Sibyl motif, is also relevant. The goat-skin garb of the Libyan nymphs also connects them with orgiastic cultssuch as those of Dionysus. This is particularly significant considering thesymbolism of the oracular advice they give toJason on this occasion.It was noon-tide and the fiercest rays of the sun were scorching Libya;they ftood near Jason, and lightly drew the cloak from his head. Andthe hero caft down his eyes and looked aside, in reverence for the god-desses, and as he lay bewildered all alone they addressed him openlywith gentle wordsr lll'{tarred one, why art thou so smitten with de{pair?We know bow ye went in que{t of the Golden Fleece; we know every taskye have faced, all tbe mighty deeds ye wrougbt in your wanderings ouerland and sea.

Like heroes too, nymphs were essentially chthonicfigures who could inspire oracles and cause possession states and ritualfrenzy. Perhaps too we should consider the role of Athena in assistingthe Argonauts, her connection with these Libyannymphs may have influ-enced Apollonius at rhis srage of his epic.[Jp then; be not tbus afii{ted in thy misery, and rouse tby comradel Andwben Amphitrite has {traightway unyoked Poseidon's swiJi-wheeled cbari-ot, then do ye pay to your mother a recompenseJ'or allher travdil wlten sbebare you so long in her womb; and so ye may return to the divine land ofAchaea.

Surely I will gather together my comradesand tell them; perhaps between us we can divine a clue of our escape, forthe counsel of many is better.The oracular pronouncement of the Libyan nymphs introduces the nextstage of the adventure.Jason roused his comrades with the news of his vi-sion, a good omen if only they could decipher its meaning. Amphitrite isof course the name of an ocean goddess, wife of Poseidon. The referenceto her unyoking the chariot of the sea god does not long remain cryptic,for a huge horse springs from the sea and gallops off across the sands.Among the Argonauts is the hero Peleus, the son of famous Aeacus whowas made ajudge in the lJnderworld. Peleus is also the father of Achillesby another sea goddess, Thetis, and thus one of the mosr senior membersof the crew. With such a pedigree he was ideally suited to interprer rheoracle:I deem tbat Poseidon's cbariot bas even now been loosed by the hands of hisdear wife, and I divine tbat our mother is none else than our ship herself;for surely she bore us in her womb and groans unceasingly with grievous"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"HOMEWAI{D BOUNT)travailing.

For be will not plunge beneath the earth; andhis hoof-prints, I am certain, will point us to some bay above the sea.The Argonauts accordingly picked up their ship and carried her acrossthe sands on their shoulders. The underlying significance of this is to besought in Dionysian ritual. From the sixth century there was a ritual ofDionysus in which a ship was rolled upon wheels or carried in proces-sion. This Burkert connects with a legend of Dionysus known from theHomeric LIymns. One form of the legend upon which this rite is basedhas Dionysus hire a ship at Icaria to take him to Naxos, but the crew arepirates and decide to sell their passenger as a slave in Asia. The god thenchanged the mast and oars into serpents and transformed himself into alion, ivy burst forth on all sides of the ship and the playing of futes filledthe air. The sailors leapt over the side and were transformed into dolphins,with the exception of the helmsman Acoetes who had protested at theirplans. Another version of the tale has the pirates kidnap the drowsingyouth from the shore at Chios or Icaria. Acoetes was terrified at the awe-some power of the god unleashed against his comrades, but Dionysusreassured him and together they sailed to Naxos as planned. Some ac-counts of the persecution of Dionysus by King Pentheus suggest that theprisoner he takes is not the god, but the faithful helmsman. This is all themore likely as the helmsman in the ritual is the priest of Dionysus, anddoubtless personifies him in some respect.Dionysus was the chief deity of Naxos, which was apparently foundedby Carian sefflers. The mythological significance of Naxos in the legendof Dionysus is considerable. Dionysus celebrated his triumphant returnfrom India on the island, a campaign that involved his departure to andreturn from foreign parts, akey element of the god s myth. It was at Naxosalso that Dionysus rescued Ariadne after she had assisted Theseus slayingthe Minotaur, and been abandoned on the island.

So roo, Eurypylus intro-duced himself to the Argonauts as born in Libya, the bome of wild beasts.The linkage he supplies between Artemis and Dionysus is also significant.Artemis is a virgin huntress, as is the nymph Cyrene; Aristaeus, who wasworshipped here alongside her, is a god of the hunt and of honey, closelylinked to Dionysus.

If the other names are not merely corrupted spellingsit is possible that the name Naberus or Nebiros derives from a syncre-tic combination of the names Anubis and Cerberus, such as Anuberos.While such syncretism is entirely valid in the context of Hellenistic magic,it would be unwise to assume Cerberus initially derived from Anubis. Acanine guardian of the heavenly afterlife with similar name and attributesto Cerberus appears in very early Indian scriptures such as the Rig Wda;Cerberus was initially a distinct Indo-European deity and apparently ce-lestial rather than chthonic. Nevertheless, as Egyptian and Greek under-world deities Cerberus and Anubis were associated in the Magical Papyri,in which context such combinations are neither uncommon nor invalid.In short, whether or not a combined form of the name gave us the read-ing Nebiros, the alias of Cerberus is an important one for understandingNebiros in the grimoires.As long ago as I9o5, Maurice Bloomfield brought scholarly attention tothe likely identity of Cerberus with two dogs appearing in the Rig Veda.This is of course the oldest religious text of ancient India, and has echoesin later Persian lore, and through to the cultures of classical antiquity. Afull argument for the identity is beyond the scope of my treatise, but thelinkage requires briefly stating. These two hounds were the dogs of Yama,god of death. The afterlife of the period was not a gloomy one, nor was itsubterranean.It resembled the afterlife of late antiquity, raised from belowto the sky once more. The deceased mounted to heaven, passing as theydid so the orbits of Sun and Moon; these luminaries were the watchdogsof Yama whom the spirit of the deceased had to pass. One of them hadthe name Qabala - tolerably close to variant forms of the Greek nameKerbelus and Cerberus &c. Both dogs of Yama bore the epkhetfour-eyed,which has been variously explained but likely indicated spots over the eyesas well as keen eyesight, but lends itself to interpretations of more thanone head.

This appearance matches that ofLamia, who as seen earlier connects with the Sibyls. It is appropriate tothis connection that she appears to have originally been an oracular deathgoddess, before the ascendancy of the Olympian cultus that reduced manyolder gods to monsters or heroes. This parentage reflects the traditioncrediting the birth of Anubis - dog-headed funerary god of Egypt - toSet and Nepthys, whereas other traditions make his father Ra, or Osiris;Anubis however is a much older god than Osiris.The duty of Cerberus was to guard the entrance to Hades; his den be-ing on the far side of the river Styx, where Charon brought the shadesof the dead in his boat. Here he prevented the living from entering theUnderworld, and the dead from leaving. This is also strongly reminiscentof Anubis, with his jackal head; the abode of the dead being in the deserton the sunset side of the Nile where howling jackals roamed,The Classical Greek god of the Underworld, Hades (called Pluto,meaning riches, to avert ill-forrune from speaking the name of the God ofDeath), is frequently depicted accompanied by Cerberus, This partner-ship has had important repercussions, of which one famous case deservesour attention here. When the first Ptolemy ruled in Egypt he introducedthe worship of Sarapis, a form of Osiris who for political reasons unitedGreek and Egyptian elements. According to Plutarch:r Ptolemy Soter saw in a dream a gigantic ftatue of Pluto - one whichhe had not previously seen and whose form he knew not - which or-dered him to bring it to Alexandria.z And when he did not know and had no idea where the (tatue wasto be found even after he had described his vision to his friends, there"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"was round a sreat;;:\"-\";;:. said he had seen atSinope judt such a colossus as the King had seen.: He fPtolemy] accordingly sent lhis agents], who afrer expendingmuch time and effort, and not wirhout the assi$tance of Gods provi-dence, removed it secretly and brought it away.a And when it had been brought to Alexandria and publicly ereCted,[his Greek and Egyptian advisors on the My$teries] Timorheus andManetho, immediately came to the conclusion rhat ir was a ftatue ofPluto - judging by its Cerberus and great Serpent - and persuadedPtolemy that it was no other God than Sarapis; for it did nor comefrom Sinope with this name, but after coming to Alexandria it receivedthe Egyptian name for Pluto, namely Sarapis.There can be no doubt that the image of a dog as part of this colossuslent itself to the identifrcation with Osiris, through his association withAnubis; and Hades, through his association with Cerberus. Note too, thatwhile Pluto was identified with Osiris, Persephone - the Queen of theGreek lJnderworld - was similarly identified with Isis in her Underworldrole.Having mentioned Manetho and syncretism of Egyptian and Greekgods, this Egyptian hierophant is also a major source for the chronologyof the Pharoahs. His account included a divine dynasty of gods completewith Greek counterparts of the relevant Egyptian gods. While fragmen-tary, this equating of gods was evidently highly influential; references toit survive in Byzantine scholiasts and elsewhere.

It is significant in this exact respect that in most accourlts of Hercules'encounter with Cerberus the hero was prepared for the ordeal by initia-tion into the Eleusian Mysteries. A central figure in these Mysteries was,of course, Persephone. Plutarch, who was initiated into both these and theMysteries of Isis and Osiris, considered them to be essentially identical, asat this time - if not before - they Iargely were.r36"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Anubis was associated with magic in Egypt from early on. A magical pa-pyrus of the third millennium ecE includes a description of its discoverybeneath his statue in a temple. In the Magical Papyri of the Greek andRoman period, Cerberus (Kerberos) is frequently invoked along withHecate, unsurprisingly given their close connection in Greek myth. Inother closely related invocations he is calied Anubis, the two having be-come in many respects interchangeable. In one of the papyfi, while ad-dressed as Kerberos, the god - evidently in semi-anthropomorphic form- is described as wielding a thunderbolt. Hecate herself was frequentlyrepresented with three heads, including one of a dog. One of her ritualtitles indeed, was Black Bitch. Her offerings also included the sacrifice ofa dog.Anubis, the familiar jackal or dog headed god of the Egyptians, was formuch of their history the god of embalming and the protector of cemeter-ies; at least officially. Indeed, as his worship is far prior to that of Osiris,he was very likely an earlier Lord of the Dead. As Egyptians knew, realdogs and jackals were all too likely to dig up and eat dead bodies and scat-ter the remains, and they were associated with all the frightfulness andfear of death. The Egyptians mad e a regular practice of harnessing as wellas propitiating negative forces; much as, in modern times, security agen-cies seek to turn enemy agents. Anubis, associated with the practice ofmagic from the early period in Egypt, is a powerful example of this prin-ciple. Examples can be found in the magic and religion of the Egyptiansthroughout their long history. Budge says of him that, in the period whenOsiris was the Lord of the Underworld; as the guide of beaven and tbeleader of souls to Osiris he was a benefcent god, but as the personrfcation oJdeath and decay be was a being wbo in{pired terror. So also in papyri of thefirst millennium sce and probably earlier he commands huge numbers ofmessenger demons; while in Magical Papyri dating to Roman times heacts as the main enforcer of curses. As the study of Egyptian culture hasprogressed, it has become apparent that the more hostile and fearsomeaspects of many deities, Anubis not least among them, had formed a largepart of folk magic from earliest times. The more respectable or positiveforms of the gods were a feature of state religion, rather than of popular"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":")PHIAbeliefi, which often viewed them rarher differently. It is in this form thatthey appear in the Papyri, which while late in Egyptian history, preservevery substantial elements of both Greek and Egyptian magical cosmologyand methodology that are extremely ancient.The Anubis of the Graco-Roman period is an extremely importantfrgure, both in the Magic al, Papyri and the widespread Mysteries of Isis.He features strongly in the magical cult of Hecate, wherein he holds thekey of the Underworld. He also frequently bears the caduceus associatedwith Hermes (who was associated with crossroads as Hecate was asso-ciated with junctions of three roads; they are occasionally combined inthe Papyri as Hermecate). Both the key and the caduceus are importantsymbols in the iconography of Hecate, and frequently appear in her rites.Clearly Anubis is considered a psychopomp, or guide of the dead, and oneof her retinue.In this capacity as well as in his official capacity of guidingshades in the LJnderworld, he could be appealed to by those who wishedto summon the spirits of the dead.This capacity to bring souls both to and from the Underworld is il-lustrated in the dual role of Anubis in the legend of Isis and Osiris. Therole of Anubis in embalming Osiris and guiding the deceased (who werealways entitled Osiris) to the underworld is important to the first part ofthis role. There is however another aspect to this, for Anubis also assistedIsis and Nepthys in the reconstruction of the body of Osiris, equivalent inmany fesPects to a resurrection.In The True Grimoire Nebiros is under the rule of Astaroth, a demon-ised form of the goddess Astarte. This relationship is best understood assimilar in nature to that between Cerberus and Hecate.A fuller discussion of the relationship between Astaroth and Hecate,aLready covered in The True Grimoire, is out of place here. For the benefitof clarity here, one or two relevant points require mention. The mythsof Hecate and Astaroth portray a goddess active in the three worlds ofHeaven, Earth and the LJnderworld; in addition a major symbol of Hecateis equally prominently connected to Astaroth. This is the pole or pillaaknown as the Asherah in the cult of Astaroth, which is also the oldestsymbol of Hecate. In her honour a simple pole was raised at places wherer38"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"NE,BIROS & HERMES CTHONIOSthree roads meer, and embellished with a mask facingeach direction. Itsoriginal nature was more similar to both the shaman's ladder, and a WorldTree or Axis, connecting the worlds.The dual narure of Anubis, dark and light, is also found in the morerespectable philosophical writings of Graco-Roman rimes. According toPlutarchr... when Nepthys conceives Anubis, Isis adoprs him. For Neprhysrepresents that below the earth and invisible [dark], while Isis repre-sents that which is above the earth and visible [ight]. And as the circlecalled'Horizon' [horizontal], touches upon rhe confines of light anddarkness alike as common to borh, so it has been called Anubis. Ir islikened to a dog according ro its charaCteridtics; for the dog is warch-ful borh by day and by nighr alike. Anubis possesses this power, asHecate with the Greeks, being ar one and the same time Infernal andCele$tial. Others believe that Anubis signifies Time IKronos], but rhisis an initiated do&rine.Plutarch also describes the offerings made to Anubis of two roosrers, onewhite, the other tawny, connecring it with Ser, or as Plutarch calls him,Typhon. His double characteristics are also evident in the description byLucius Apuleius of his image in processions of Isis in Roman Italy:...immediarcIy after these came the Deities...the foremo$t amongthem rearing terrifically his dogs head and di$playing alternately a faceblack as night, and as golden as the day; in his left hand the caduceus,in his right the green palm branch.Note that he appears first among the deities here, as also in the rituals ofthe MagicalPapyri,6rst Anubis is summoned in vision; as messenger hethen brings in with equal facllity either the Celestial gods, or demons andthe shades of the dead. Many attributes of Anubis connecr him stronglywith the Greek messenger god, Hermes, the caduceus and palm branchnot least of all. That they were associated by the ancienrs is not in doubt.r39"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Bear in mind however that Hermes too possesses dual forms, with differ-ent roles and even different parenrs. Hermes was not only the herald ofZeus, but, as Hermes Chthonios, also of Hades, god of the Underworld.It is in this capacity, as guide of the spirits of the dead, or psychopomp,that Anubis most resembles him.

He is an excellent spirit for a practical magician to form an agree-ment with, as his many followers will provide the operator with assistancein workings for many purposes.Among those who are his followers he has a particularly close relation-ship with Huictigaras. Besides the spirits who follow him, Nebiros has anaffinity with Claunech, (who is under Satanachia, a deputy of Lucifer).These two affinities are interesting, for Claunech is the first among thespirit followers of the deputies, as Huictigaras is the last. Additionally,Claunech is said to be beloved of Lucifer, so this affinity also underlinesthe importance of Nebiros in the scheme of the grimoire.His astrological correspondences are similarly universal, his day beingsolar, his zodiacal degree lunar, and The Star being a title of his sphere.These three symbols of course are also components of the standard tal-isman of the Grimoire. Nebiros can be readlly invoked in operations ofSun, Moon and the Stars, (including geometrical stars formed from con-junction cycles of the planets).His I'Jature and PowersThere are few signs of his former gLory in the Naberus alias Cerberus inWeyer, or the Naberius in those grimoires derived from Scot, such as rheGoetia of Solomon In these books he is described as a crow a bird withsimilar associations to the jackal admittedly, but no Hound of Hell. Hishoarse bestowal of the gifts of oratory and rhetoric is also appropriateto a Hermes Chthonios, but otherwise he is a shadow of his former self,though he fares rather better in the truly goetic grimoires. The Nebirosof the Grand Grimoire, a close cousin of The True Grimoire and of that ofHonorius shows him clearly, his status and nature undiminished in anysignificant respect from the Anubis of the papyritNebiros can do evil to whomsoever he wishes, make known or causeto be found the hand of glory, and the qualities of metals, minerals,vegetables and animals pure and impure, and predi&ion - e$peciallyby necromancy."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Nebiros can do euil to whomsoeuer he wishes: or, ro render the intentionmore accurately, whomsoever the magician wishes. This is Anubis as thechief enforcer of curses, invoked as a chthonic force, Cerberus to whomofferings or ritual deposits are made ar crossroads and in the cemetery. Hecan bestow the Hand of Glory: the main de gloire - which in medieval andlater folklore was made from the hand of a hanged criminal sdll upon thegallows, which were frequently located ar crossroads. The French mainde gloire was originally the mandragore or mandrake, a magical plant ofthe very first degree, associated with Hecate and with Astarte. So too,the hand can be formed from the root and srems of a fern gathered onSt. John's Eve, along with the seed of the fern, which confers invisibility.That this date approximates the Summer Solstice, when Anubis visits allthe cemeteries and a great festival is held by his worshippers, is more thanfortuitous,In its later form, and possibly its original form roo, this hand (a term richwith meaning in Hoodoo and Afro-American conjure traditions thrivingtoday) was said to be the tool of criminals, able to send the occupants of ahouse into a magical sleep. It is an interesting possibility that this instru-ment of magical robbery was borrowed from rreasure hunting rites, whichconnect with journeys to the underworld. In any case, these associationswith the crossroads and corpses, with criminality, especialLy theft, are cer-tainly appropriate to a Hermes Chthonios; and to a dog headed god, aninfernal Hermanubis, and a semi-Egyprian Cerberus. These though areouter meanings of the symbolism; for the initiate of the Mysteries, or rothe archaic shaman to whom these themes belong in their primal glory,the significance of the great LJnderworld talisman is that it confers pow-ers of invisibility, of entering the lJnderworld unharmed; returning withwisdom, and healing power to defeat the evils of disease, or of ignorance.He can discover the cyalities of metals and minerals: this too is clearly de-rived from an underworld role. Hades, as king of rhe lower world had pos-session of everything under earth, including merals, minerals and all theprodu&ions of the earth. The King of the chthonic elementals or Gnomeshas the same power, whether or not he be dark Pluto himself."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"This partially explains too why this power of Nebiros extends to vegeta-bles and animals pure and impurl.Indeed, among plants Hades claims themyrtle tree, the narcissus and the maiden-hair.Let us not forget either thepoppy or the pomegranate, and their place in the legend of Persephone.Or that Hecate the companion and Demeter the mother of Persephone,dark Hades bride, also represent fertility, besides their long associationwith death and its mysteries. These goddesses of the Underworld arealways associated with crops, and with herds. Potnia Theron - Lady ofthe Beasts - is among their oldest titles. Nor are such associations exclu-sive to the feminine Underworld deities, as a beast himselfi, and a Lord ofthe Beasts, this power too belongs to our syncretic Hermes Chthonios.Nor should we forget that Nebiros is a deputy of Astaroth in the verygrimoire ro which this description belongs. The Hecate qualities of theancient Astaroth include the same rulership of the animal and vegetablekingdoms. A sophisticated application of herbal lore is involved with theSolstice rites associated with Nebiros, as will be seen later.Lastly Nebiros has the power of prediction, especiaTy by necromtncJ,which he can confer upon the magician. In the MagicalPapyri, Anubis isfrequently invoked in operations of general divination and of necromancy.Both he and Cerberus are also invoked in other rituals involving spirits ofthe dead. There are many rituals given in the papyfi for divination in a ves-sel of water, a method known as hydromancy. This method is employed tobring in gods, spirits of various kinds, and the dead through the mediationof Anubis in his role of Chthonic Hermes. Which gods or spirits wereto be summoned also decided which kind of water was usedr rainwater rJyou are calling upon heavenly gods, seawater f gods of tbe eartb, river waterif Osiris or Saraytis, lpringwater f tbe dead.There are very strong links be-tween this form of hydromancy and the practice of necromancy, andwhenspring water is used - as in a related process in The True Grimoire forexample - it invariably indicates this connection is in force.While there are vadations in the form, many of these rituals involveAnubis, particularly those of the demotic papyri; on occasion, the vesselemployed is referred to specifically as the cup of Anubis.The reader is toldthat this cup is to have the face of Anubis engraved within it. Most often"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"such a cup is used for the obtain,\", ; \";-ons, of spirits of various kindsthrough the mediation of Anubis. There are related forms of hydromancywhich interpret the results of casting three stones into the bowl. Possiblythe areas of his face (particularly rhe ears, eyes, nosrrils and mourh) wereused to interpret the positions of such stoner. (Hydro-ancy is describedin greater detail in the Book\" of Elelogap, the three srones could be round,triangular, and square with appropriate sigils). In the Papyrus of [.Jnas,which is much more ancient than the Magical Papyri, the face of Anubisrepresents the face of the deceased enabling him to go forth without fearwhile confronting the spirits in the Underworld. The expected veracityboth of the messenger god, and by extension of divination involving him,is indicated in the Socratic Oath. Whenever the noble philosopher sworean oath or made a statement in regard to truth, he said by the dog, in tokenof the faithfulness of that animal as a divine symbol. In Plato's Gorgias heextends the form of this oath to by the dog the god of the Egyptians (Gorgiasa9z6). This is strikingly appropriate to Anubis the weigher of souls inthe Egyptian underworld, where the heart of the deceased was weighedagainst the feather of righteousness in the Hall of Truth.This description of the powers associated with Nebiros, examined thusdetail by detail, shows him to resemble the Anubis and Cerberus of theolder magical tradition exacdy. So roo, in the grimoires in which this de-scription appears, he is - like Anubis - one of the great commanders ofthe infernal armies, a Field Marshal no less. Nor is this less than mightbe expected, known and understood by a medieval European magician.Agrippa (Three Books of Occuk Philosophy rrr ch. r8) reminds us:Porphry saith, their Prince is Serapis, who is also called Pluto by rheGreeks, and also Cerberus is chief among$t rhem, that three'headeddog: vrz. because he is conversant in three elemenrs, fAir/Water/Earth], a moft pernicious devil; whence also Proserpina, who can dovery much in these three elements, is their princess'.While in chapter 16 he informs the reader whose eyes are open to thepagan roots of medieval sorcery:"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"NEBIROS & HERMES CTHONIOS... four moft mischievous kings do rule over the orhers, according tothe four parts of the world; under these many more princes of legionsgovern, and also many of private offices. Hence the wicked Gorgons,the Furies.

Surprisingly enough, though the most commonly encounteredcontexts of such spells are malefic, this is not always the case in the Papyri.There an example occurs of use of knotted cloths to stop haemorrh age af-ter childbirth, (and possibly heavy periods and bleedingafrcr childbirth).Another context of binding, where Anubis is invoked while tying with acord of 365 knots, arises in pcvt tv 296-466. Here the spell is from theclass of aggressive love magic. In addition, Anubis often appears in magi-cal inscriptions, and upon amulets such as the Gnostic gems. In short,whether as Nebiros in Tbe True Grimoire, or as Anubis or Cerberus inthe Papyri, in rnagic his power is extremely versatile, even comprehensive.OftringsAccording to Plutarch, Anubis was offered two roosters, one white andthe other of a saffron colour. Or as we might say, one white, one red, whichcolour the Egyptians associated with Set. This is in accord rvith the natureof Anubis; half light, as Son of Osiris, and half dark as Son of Set.As an Underworld offering it was customary for heroes to offer Cerberusa ritual cake, made from barley mixed with honey, in order to enter theUnderworld while in lifa Such a cake was also buried with the dead toappease Cerberus, and perhaps elicit his aid in reaching the Underworld,rather than wander as a lost soul. Two such cakes were carcied by visitorsto Underworld oracular shrines, one for Cerberus and one for the ghostlyPython. Not surprisingly, such offerings occasionally figure in the MagicalPapyri, but there can be no doubt of their earlier provenance.

At that time an image of him wasstruck by lightning, and a new temple on rhe Capitoline Hill was dedicat-ed to him shortly thereafter on the zo'l'ofJune. From then on he received asacrifice every year on this date.In addition he received propitiarion in theform of wheel shaped cakes called summanalia, perhaps symbolising thewheel of his chariot. The Latin poet Plautus (died r84 ncn) representedhim as the god of thieves, of whom night time is the friend. However hewas a mysterious entity to the Romans, Ovid (bort-t 43 ncn), a well in-formed mythographer was unable to provide any details.A fine Italian tomb gable depicts him with shaggy locks and paternalbeard, bearing a fistful of thunderbolts and with two grear serpentinelegs. The derivation of his name has two explanations; the mosr likely andwidely accepted is from the Latin sub-manus - before the morning. Thisis likely to be the original sense, but was overshadowed by al\"ater theorywhich has merit in its own right. The sinister repurarion of Summanusled to an alternative derivation which has been extremely infuential, de-riving his name from Summus Manium, the greatest of the Manes,which isto say the chief of the dead. This was accepted by Martianus CapelI^ (+\"'century eo), who called him Dis Pater (Father Hades, i.e. Pluto).

This, and the solsticial date of his feast,recommends a syncreric link of Summanus with Nebiros, a necromancerand Field Marshal of Hades. Bear in mind also the cakes offered to bothSummanus and Cerberus.Considering the thunderbolt wielded by Cerberus in the Papyri, thisassociation may well have infuenced their composition. In this conrexr,the use of 365 knots in magical ligatures is very significant. Three hun-dred and sixty five is the number given to solar-pantheistic forms of deity,such as Abraxas.

The signifi cance of this day continued in magical traditions of theNew World, for example, from the early days of Voodoo in New Orleansthe greatest rite of the year has been held on SaintJohns day. In Europe,Morocco and Algeria the Midsummer rires, with their bonfires, survivedfrom pagan times until the nineteenth century and later. Midsummer alsoholds pride of place among the festivals of British Neo-paganism, a posi-tion which is unlikely to be unique to those Isles.

The survival of these Midsummerr48"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":".MES CTHONIOScustoms in Islamic countries where a lunar calendar is used, by which no6xed solar date is or can be marked, is particularly striking.European rites were often celebrated on hilltops, and even mounrains,often with a river or spring below, in fields and pasrures, at crossroadsand in marketplaces; North African rites were held in courtyards and atcrossroads, as well as on threshing floors and in the fields.Many of these festivals are described in Frazer's Golden Bough, whichwhile dated in some respects is still a useful reference regardingsuch cus-toms,There is an enormous amount of magical lore associated with plantsconnected to this date. Included among these plants are several namedafter or associated with Saint John, especially the Midsummer fern andSt.Johns wort.Judging from Frazer, in the North African rites the herbalassociations of these rites at frrst appear more extensive. His account in-cludes giant-fennel, thyme, rue, chervil-seed, chamornile, geranium andpennyroyal, and this is simply a selection from among many aromaricplants. However, the herbal lore associated with the European rites is alsoextensive, and in some respects lTrore revealing.The bonfires are frequently composed of specially chosen woods. Sornetraditions speak of three types of wood, others of nine; still others add atoadstool to the nine woods. Besides the woods a number of plants arealso gathered. These are also intended to be burned in many cases. Somecommentators have assumed rhis is a simple weeding of potentially dan-gerous plants from pastureland. Certainly some of the plants are poren-tially dangerous, but an examination of what these rires are intended toachieve reveals more complex motives. The intention is to prorect fromwitchcraft, thunder, hail and disease, and specific pesrs. The fires are of-ten deliberately to windward of pasture land, or of crops and orchards.A major part of the rite is the production of smoke, and several of theplants involved are powerful against various parasites, internal and exter-nal. While it is likely enough that ridding pastures of these toxic plants isa consideration, closer examination shows there was also clear recogni-tion of their virtues. Some of these plants and their uses are known tohave been employed in the Roman world, and the plain implication is thatthese rites involve survivals from much earlier times."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"It is believed, probably quite rightly, that the smoke kills feas. Cattle aredriven through or between 6res, or over the place where the fire burnedthe previous night. People expose children, the sick and themselves tothe smoke which heals and removes ill fortune from men, animals, crops,and fruit-trees. Many ailments are said to be prevented by these rites, andthese also correspond to the virtues of the plants. It is significant too thatnot all plants gathered are burnt; some - often in the form of wreaths -are kept for later use. So too is a residue of ash and some charred brandsfrom the fire. These are put to various magical uses, detailed below. Thatsome herbal preparations - such as tinctures and decoctions - involvingthese same plants were in widespread use is a likely enough assumption.Fire and smoke from the fires drove off evil spirits, witches, dragons,trolls believed to be abroad that night. This is a common feature of firefestivals, although the idendfication of disease and demons shows a verypractical aspect to the ritual.The main features of such 6re festivals were and are primarily: fireslit on high places, torchlit processions, rolling of a fire wheel or wheelsdown the hill. Launching 6re disks from fexible rods was anoth er activitycommonly associated with these celebrations, in anticipation of modernfireworks.

They werefrom their very beginning a Western literary genre. While superfrciallysimilar, the ritual materials inscribed for Assyrian kings and the magicalpapyri of Egyptian pharaohs bear a relation to this long lived genre whichis distinct socially, culturally and geographically.As remarked byJoseph Peterson, and noted by Skinner and Rankinein their Writable Key of Solomon,the earliest texts of the Solomonic genreare Greek: both Hellenisti'^ (The Testament olf Solomon) and Byzantine(Tb, nygromanteia). As indicat ed earlier, the grimoires have their earliestancestors in the Orphic books.

The principal excep-tion is what can be extrapolated from surviving ritual deposits such as thedefixiones , and engraved gnostic gems. Its importance to this study, andto a critical re-evaluation of goetic magic, is inestimable. Various thingsr56"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE MAGICAL PAPYRIbecome apparenr to rhe student of magic when comparing the papyriwith the grimoires. Details emerge which explode assumptions concern-ing goetia from hostile perspectives. Firstly, it is necessary ro underlinecertain salient facts. Betz observes in his masterly introduction that theUnderworld in the papyri has assumed massive importance.It appears tome that this may not be such a recent developmenr, when the transferralof the Underworld to the sky is properly considered. According again toBetz, the Underworld has also expanded ro encompass deities who for-merly had no Underworld role; this too requires appraisal in a wider con-text.Betz also notes what he takes to be cases of reversion to pre-Classicalforms, of gods reassuming their earlier daimonian narure.It is more likelythough that a prior sublimation of these daimonian forms was nor in factgeneral; that in the appropriate contexts these forms had remained intact.rf Betz is right, then cultural reasons may have existed for the apparentexpansion of the Underworld; the pessimism of civilisations conqueredby Rome foremost among them. Perhaps too it is here, rarher than inChristianity, that we find rhe original demonisation of the pagan gods.However, when he gives Helios as an example of this tendency to chthoni-cisation, certain major difficulties arise which require examination a littlelater.However, in terms of magical cosmology and practice, the comprehen-sive importance of the LJnderworld has significance separare from theseconsiderations. It piainly marks the major part of the magic portrayedtherein as goetic, in that it emphasises spirits of rhe dead, Underworldexperiences and other chthonic considerations. In this respect it eitherreprises or simply continues the magic of a much earlier period.Indeed, itis a fact that the old Mystery cults became a major concern of Hellenisticintellectual life in the period in which these documents were composed.That the Magical Papyri are rhe ancesrors of the later grimoires is agiv-en, the relations between them are plain. There is, firstly, the presence ofSolomon and Moses as magical heroes and the use ofJewish god-names(by no means exclusive, but sufficiently prefigurin glarcr use). Alongsidethese are other elements, from other cultural roots, such as the use ofmagical symbols and lemers known as characters. These are often identical"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"with symbols found in the grimoires, or of a plainly similar type. There isalso, as shown earlier in the chapter concerning Nebiros and in the chap-ter of The True Grimoire concerning Astaroth, a considerable foreshad-owing of the principal dramatis persone of the grimoires.Alongside this is another important issue, the identity of the Processesof the papyri with those described in the Theurgy of Iamblichus. Thisequivalence shows quite plainly that the distinction understood to existbetween ancient theurgy and goetia is largely false. While goetia had be-come a derogatory tefm its identity remains clear; a species of magic con-cerned with the Underworld that perpetuated older PersPectives, albeitin reformed guise. The only real distinction is that what was called goetiawas often pracriced by persons outside the intellectual and philosophicalelites. Iamblichus, a major leader of the Neoplatonist school, gave the oldmagic respectability through supplying it with a philosophical interPreta-tion. Ther eafter the term theurgy was the designation preferred by magi-cians who saw themselves, or wished to be seen, as religious conformistsor as morally and intellectually superior to more marginalised magicians.However, inpractical terms - sometimes concePtual terms as well - therewas little difference. Lack of philosophical acumen on the part of Pructi'tioners did not prevent them claiming to be theurgists to avoid the oppro-brium associated with the devalued term, nor were philosophers immuneto charges of goetia.That after the Orphic books the Papyri are the next ancestral source ofthe grimoires is, as said above, a given. The arrival of this ancestral streamin the world of Christian Europe is not problematic either. One route wasthe survival of Hellenistic civilisation under the Christian Byzantines,who influenced the successors of the Western empire, and was the mostdirect route of Solomonic forms. The other however was the Islamicworld that enthusiastically absorbed and added to hellenistic learning,including its magical lore. In modern occult circles, the most accessibleevidence of this inherited lore transmitted in turn to the West, is in thecompendium of magic known as the Picatrix.This tome, compiled by an Islamic scholar, was first translated forEuropeans in medieval Spain.In it the names of Greek sages are constantlyr58"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THTl MAGICAI- PAPYRImentioned: aphorisms are attributed to Empedocles and clear srarementsmade of Neoplatonist theoryr the great chain of being, symparhia and soforth.

Anunknown work attributed to one Kriton, a common Greek name, is citedalongside Apollonius and others. That these attributions are no mere lit-etary device is plain enough from the descriptions of talismans and otherdetails, which plainly have pagan origins. Most of the designs of magicalimages in the Picatrix found their way into Agrippa and elsewhere. Severalare recognisable as similar in design to earlier gnostic gems and talismansmanufactured by, or according to the instructions o[, hellenistic magicians.As mentioned in Book One, there has been debate concerning the rela-tion of the hermetic corpus and the Magical Papyri. Some see rhe first ashigh or learned Hermetica, and the other as low or popular Hermetica.Such a distinction is utterly irrelevant in the Picatrix,where sophisticatedHermetic philosophy forms the basis of magical practices directly relaredto the papyi.The two form a conrinuum, and this is more likely than notto reflect Hellenistic forms. This is not to say there were no individuals whospecialised; simply that one did not exempr its exponents from the other.AbraxasMuch ink has been expended on the mysterious Gnostic deity known asAbraxas, with ideas ranging from the erudite to the farcical. The impor-tance of the figure to this study is in the self-evident but scarcely remarkedrelation of Abraxas to Helios, god of the Sun. This close identity is ap-parent in several prominent features: firstly, as is well known, the nameAbraxas sums to 365 in Greek gematria, the number of days in a solaryear. Secondly, it is by no means unusual to see Abraxas represented ina chariot, a standard emblem of Helios. Indeed, even when the chariot isabsent a charioteer's whip is usually presenr. Abraxas, in Greek letters asin English, has seven letters, signifying his dominion over the planetaryspheres, as well as every day of the year. The pantheistic narure of Abraxas"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAis fully in accord with Neoplatonist ideas concerning Helios in late antiq-uity, wherein he is the most important of the old gods, the heart of thecosmos. This status simply reflected his exalted status in Orphism, whichwas of long standing.Jewish iconography too was infuenced by iate Helios theology, andmosaic floors have been excavated in synagogues representing God inhis chariot, surrounded by symbols of the seasons. The mysteries of theChariot, central to Merkavah mysticism lends itself to such associations.There has been considerable speculation concerning the attributes of theAbraxas figure, with its rooster's head, upraised flail and shield. None, sofar as I am aware, have pointed to the resemblance of the serpent legs toimages of chthonic giants, or of Typhon. By far the likeliest interpretationof this element of the image is dominion over the earth and Underworld,as major components of his universality.Betz'comments notwithstanding, what could be perceived as a chthonicrole for Helios developed at least as early as the sixth century; when hisnightjourney in a cup entered Greek myth. Apollo, whose chthonic quali-ties derive from gods such as Nergal and Reshef as well as his close as-sociation with Dionysus, was first perceived as a Sun god in the 6fth cen-tury; this development originated in Orphic and allied sources. SimilarlyPlato, in his Laws, clearly identified Helios and Apollo, giving them thesame official to preside over their cults.In this, he simply followed Orphicprecedent; Orpheus refused honours to Dionysus, giving them instead toHelios, who he called Apollo.Although the state cult of the Roman period elevated the Sun to themain deity, the roots of this idea can be perceived much earLier, in philo-sophical, magical and popular traditions. Also derived from Plato, andprior Ionian sources, was the idea of the Underworld in the night sky. Inthis schema, Sun and Moon were identified with Hades and Persephone,and the zodiac and Milky Way with paths or rivers of the Underworldetc. Persephone'.s identification with the Moon explains the title Childrenof the Moon, given to Orphic initiates, who had expiated the original sinimplicit in the Titans murder of Dionysus, her son."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE ]VIAGICAI, PAPYRIPlanetWeek\"daySundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdayGreek godsJiom papyriHeliosSeleneAresHermesZeusAphroditeKronose@dg,+rOq(Helios eo Selene = Hodes e, Persephone)Franz Cumont in his oriental Religions in Roman Paganism speaks ofSolar pantheism developed in Syria in the Hellenistic period under theinfluence of Chaldean astrological religion. From there rhis view of theSun-god as a panrheistic deity or demiurge became official in the RomanEmpire.In this respecr, as in others, Hellenistic Syria was as important tothe developmenr of Western magic as developmenrs in Egypt in rhe samedme frame. From his Eurocentric srance, with inbuilt Judzo-Christianbias, Cumont emphasises the importance of this deity in the developmentof religion: The la{t formula reached by the religion of the pagan Semites andin consequence by that of tbe Romans, was a diuinity unique, almigbty, eter-nal, universal and inefable, that reuealed itself tbroughout nature, but whosemo{t $lendid and mo{t energetic manife{tation was tbe sun. To arriue at tbeChrillian monotheism only one tie had to be broken, that is to say, this su-preme being residing in a ditlant heaven had to be remoued beyond the world.So we see once more in tbis in{tance, how the propagation of the Oriental cultsleuelled the roads for Chri{tianity and heralded its triumph. Today we mightlegitimately wonder whether this separation from the world was such anadvance. For the time being however it is merely importanr ro bear inmind that the separarion was nor a feature of the pantheistic sun god,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":")PH IAquite the contrary. Though later theology might obscure this element ofhis nature , part of the purpose of what follows is to underline the implica-tions of his chthonic connections.Jupiter Heliopolitanus was indeed originally a solar god of Syria,whose stupendous temple survives at Baalbek, reflecting his importancein Roman religion before Christianity. Prior to the Roman adoption ofthe god, the Greeks had associated him with both Zeus and Helios. Asa pantheistic deity he subsumed the seven planets, busts of the gods ofwhich are found decorating the front of some statues of the god below awinged solar disk. On some such statues, very recognisable Greek formsare foundr it is Helios & Selene, Mars & Mercury, Jupiter & Venus thatappear in pairs with Saturn alone beneath them. The order of appearancefrom right to left and top to bottom is the order of the days of the weekassociated with these planets. On occasion seven Eastern deities appearinstead, and on other occasions the signs of the zodiac. All of which un-derlines the identification in the papyri of Helios with Abraxas. There,though he appears elsewhere in other guises, he is plainly equivalent toAion, all encompassing god of eternity.Zeus orJupiter Heliopolitanus are obviously Greek and Roman namesfor a native god. In Syria he was called Baal, and he was associated withthe Egyptian Set, as well as Reshef, Baal as a Sun god is easy to 6nd inthe Picatrix and elsewhere, and he rules over 6re as well as the Sun. Thisis the source of the name as one of the Four Kings of the Elements in de-monology. An alternative for this name, Oriens, is a title of the Sun in theRoman cult of the god. Like Helios and Abraxas the god holds a whip. HisRoman title, Iovi Optimo Maximo Heliopolitano (most high and greatJupiter of Heliopolis), provided a mystic formula: I O M H. Associatingthis pantheistic solar god with Abraxas involves no leaps, since Syrian andChaldean cosmology were part and parcel of the Hellenistic synthesis,and the conceptions involved scarcely differ.Whether disconnection from the world equates with a superior con-cept of deity is a moot point. In any case there are conflicting accountsof the cosmology of Basilides, in whose school Abraxas appears to origi-nate. Depending which is correct, Abraxas may be eitherr the greatest of"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the Gnostic Archons (supported incidentally by the fact that the nameSabaoth is written on the Abraxas gems), or the First Principle fromwhich all originates. The latter is a conception of deity which connecrswith the unknowable God of Neoplaronism, of Kabbalah, and of thevery theology which Cumont considered so exceptional. My point standswithout diminishing the perceived connections of this same figure withthe Hekalot of theJewish tradition, and the zodiacal Sun god representedon ancient synagogue mosaics.In the appropriate cultural context the ty-phonian and chthonic associations of the solar pantheistic deity neverrhe-less argue for a manifested and personal god, though on a supreme scale.An interesting feature of Hellenistic syncretism is the association ofIAO-Sabaoth with the Bacchic cry of 1o Sabazlos. This essentially idenri-6es Dionysus as the supreme god, as appropriate to the prophecy thathe would ultimately supplant Zeus as ruler of the gods and the universe.Regarding the Abraxas gems referred to aLready, there are two descrip-tions of related stones in the Magical Papyri. pcM xrr. zot-6g, and pcnrxtr 27o-3so both describe the making of magical rings bearing engravedstones, on the first is a snake with its tail in its mouth, inside this Selene (acrescent moon) tipped by rwo stars and above these Helios (a sun). BesideHelios the name Abraxas is to be engraved, the same name is to be writrenon the other side of rhe srone, while around the border is engraved IAO-Sabaoth. The consecration of this ring involves what is unmistakably achthonic offering. Prior to a sacrifice and libation a pit is dug, at a placeopen to the sky, or if this is not possible aclean, sanctified tomb; a 6re isthen built over it for a burned offering.The second involves engraving on a heliotrope srone, green with redflecks, as commenred in Tbe True Grimoire.In this text Helios is to bedrawn in the form of the circular snake embiem, inside which is a scarabsurrounded by rays, on the back of rhe stone the name in hieroglyph-ics. All kinds of aromatics may be used in the offering to the god, exceptfrankincense which is specifically excluded. The identical prohibition oc-curs in the Orphi c Hymn to Dionysus Chthonios (The Orphic LIymns no.5z). This is reminiscent of the assumed connection between Sabaoth andSabazius in Hellenistic syncretism.r63"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":":)PH IAAlthough neither the translator nor the editor have noted it, the consecra-tion ritual of the {irst of these rings appears to be the spell for all occasionscited in other rituals of the papyri. Both are Helios rites, containing com-parable and connected themes.The Spell_for AII Occasions or Consecration of all Purposes (rcr'r w ry96-715) invokes Helios as the greatest god, it specifies that his power extendsouer the world and under the world. He is entitled the Agathos Daimon, animportant honorific, and the celestial heaven is termed his processionalway. He is also specifically called the great Serpent, again identifying himwith the snake with its tail in its mouth, representing the whole of crea-tion and of time. The ritual is an all purpose consecration rite; accordinglyinstructions are given to rewrite the petitions involved as required, to givepower to whatever is being consecrated, citing its purpose. A fusillade ofbarbarous names then follows, among which the Abraxas title, Sabaoth, isconspicuous. This introduces a twelve stage incantation, where the god isgreeted in terms of twelve times, images and names, and the petitio n givepower to this image, talisman etc, made for N spoken after each.

As usual in Egyptian magic the intentionhas to be added by the operaror (add tbe usual, or do rhe ,|JN matter).Theimportant thing is that this consecration ritual is designed for adaptationas required, constantly redrafted as appropriate to specific operations. Infact several rituals in the Papyri specify its use, and their diversity cerrainlyconfirms the universality of its intended application. To illustrare that itspurpose extended beyond talismans and amulers, one of these (ncv rvr87z-rgz7) involves the makin& nor of a talisman but a magical statue ofCerberus for use in amatory rituals.The consecration for all purposes bears comparison with later grimoi're consecrations, in particular one in Verum entitled The Orison of theInstrumenf .

She is identical for our purposes with the Cretanmother of Zeus, her son and lover who was born, slain and risen.JupiterDolichenus is readily connected with her through his attributes, the bulland double-axe. These motifs are associated with in the first place theHittite farher god and in the second the son, and are strongly linked alsowith Cretan cults. Thus it is a safe assumption that the title where iron isborn indicates that he was the successor of earlier sons and lovers of thegoddess.This Jupiter Dolichenus was also frequently identified with JupiterHeliopolitanus, so that we can view him as both a pantheistic deity amongthe highest corlceptions of late paganism, and more primitively a god offerdlising sunshine and storm. The interplay of roles associated with theSun and the planet Jupiter is of course a frequent theme with both Zeusand Baal in various forms, as has been seen at various points in this study.The association of this god with precious metals points also to the primi-tive origins of the god Heph&stus, with all his connections with Helios.That the metals were born of 6re, associated also with the brightness ofthe sky and the sun, underpins all these connections.Incidentally, while tin is often more commonly associated with Jupiterin the grimoires, the correspondence of silver is by no means lost in thetransition from Byzantine to later Western magic. Agrippa lists silver asassociated with Jupiter, and he (and thus Barrett) also says of Jupiter'stalismanic figures that being engraved on silver they grant all the benefitsassociated with the planet; silver is also the only metal mentioned in thedescription of the Pentacles of Jupiter in the Key of Solomon (see in par-ticular the fourth Pentacle ofJupiter).This discussion of the solar-pantheistic deity who rules over fire andmetals concludes with an invocation linking the subject with the next tofollow.

Both of these dei-ties are extremely important in this context, with an influential pres-ence far beyond their initial cultural environs. Hecate had brought thatstatus with her to Egypt and the Roman Empire from her existing posi-tion in the Mystery religions of Asia Minor and Greece. Typhon mergedwith Egyptian Set and proceeded to become the premier deity of ma-gicians throughout the Roman world. Hecate evolved from one originalcharacter, through various phases, to become the premier female witchdeity. Typhon-Set's evolution has a different character, in which well-known Egyptian elements are as prominent as Greek. Nevertheless, asa composite deity, his status in Greek tradition also preserves importantthemes. While there have been many recent studies of Hecate, the role ofTyphon in late pag n magic is also of uttermost importance. Indeed, hisimportance persists in various forms throughout modern occultism, butmany historical and mythic elements are under emphasised.

The GreekTyphon is the mythological embodiment of the power resident in srorm,volcano and earthquake alike. He is represented as either a ravening windstorm or an immense fire-breathing gianr. His form was mosr remark-able; in appearance his body was human down to his thighs; from themextended a colossal mass of vipers, long enough to reach up ro his head,and constantly hissing. His whole body bore many wings, while springingfrom his head and cheeks were masses of 6lthy hair which floated in thewind. He had a hundred serpentine heads springing from his arms - inplace of fingers according to some - and devouring fame gouted from hismouth and eyes.This is perhaps why, while represenred with three human heads or asingle one of an ass, a hundred heads are his frequent attribute, occur-ring sometimes without mention of any others. The sound of him wasas abominable as the sight; each of his heads spoke in a frightening voice.Some spoke in the speech of the gods, a difFerent sound and language rothat of men. Others bellowed like a bull, or whistled, or barked like a dog,others uttered horrific cries as of the shrieks of wild beasrs.Typhon was the largest and most formidabl e creatvre ever born, hisheight was above the mountains and his head frequently scraped the stars.When he stretched out his arms to either side he rouched the rwo hori-zons of East and West. There are several accounts of his parentage, andall are of interest.The first, and in some respects the most interesting version of all, creditsHera with creating Typhon without male intervenrion, a duplicate of themyth of Hephastus, whose myth connects with that of Typhon ar variouspoints. According to this version she gave responsibility for raising hercreation to the monsrer Python at Delphi. However the Homeric LIymn toApollo and the Scholiast to Apollonius of Rhodes actually identify Pythonwith Typhon, which may be simply the Cilician pronunciation of Python.This thesis is supported by the appearance of a Corycian cave at bothlocations and in both myths."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Secondr some, such as Hesiod and Apollodorus, reckon him the young-est son of Gaia and Tartarus. Angry at the defeat of the Giants, her sons,she brought Typhon ro birrh in Cilicia to avenge them. The Cilician loca-tion is an important part of the myth in all its forms; the'Roman cult ofMithras, with its cave, originated here in later times.Third, according to othersr Gaia, in revenge for the defeat of her sonsthe Giants, slandered Zeus to Hera. Hera sought assistance from Kronosin avenging the slight and received two eggs coated with his semen whichwhen buried would produce a demon capable of depriving Zeus of histhrone,Typhon attacked Olympus, belching 6re, hissing and screaming withhis many mouths, while hurtling blazingrocks like comets. This so terri-fred the gods that they fled to Egypt in horror and disguised themselves asanimals: Zeus aram; Hermes an ibis, Apollo a crow, Hera a cow Dionysusa goat, Artemis a cat, Aphrodite a fish and so on.While Zeus is included in this mythological aside, both he and Athenaare exempted of this shameful behaviour in the main account. Zeus is saidto have responded with a barcage of thunderbolts as Typhon advanced.When Zeus and Typhon came to close quarter 6ghting, Zetrs producedthe adamantine sickle of Kronos (which as we have seen is also the sickleof Demeter, made by the Telchines). Typhon then fled andZeus pursuedhim, until Typhon made a stand at Mount Kasion in Syria. Here Zeusclosed again with Typhon, perceiving him to be badly wounded; Typhonhowever caught Zetts in the coils of his many serpents, deprived him ofthe sickle and cut out the tendons of his hands and feet. Wading throughthe ocean to Cilicia carryingZeus a helpless prisoner, he next rested at theCorycian cave. Here he secreted the severed tendons in a bearskin, and setDelphine - half maid, half serpent - to guard it.According to one version, Hermes and Pan recovered the tendons andrestored Zeus unobserved. Another has it that Cadmus - himself a mon-ster slayer - regained the sinews for Zeus by a stratagem.When Zeus had recovered his strength he pursued Typhon to MountNysa where the Fates falsely informed Typhon that he would gain strengthfrom eating the food of men. Following their advice he lost more of his"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"strength. Mount Nysa of course is strongly associated with the myth ofDionysus, whose myth also includes a dethronemenr of Zeus,Battle was rejoined in Thrace at Mount Haimos, this mountain wasalso associated with Boreas, the god of the North wind. Ahhough Typhon(from whence our word typhoon) is strongly connecred with winds, be-ing the parent of the Furies who were - among other things - wind de-mons, Boreas is not reckoned his son. It is curious then that this impor-tant element of the Typhonian myrh should happen here, as if an ancientmythographer were identifying Typhon with the wind god in defiance ofalternative traditions. In the ensuing combat Typhon threw huge moun-tains, butZeus hurled them back upon him wirh thunderbolts.The bloodfrom the wounds these inficted upon Typhon is given as the reason forthe name of the place. When he set out to flee across the Sicilian sea Zeuscast Mount Etna upon him, trapping him under irs immense bulk. To thisday fames arise from it.Etna was not the original prison of Typhon, earlier accounrs give theregion known as Tartarus that honour. However, according to Hesiodthe embodied and personified Tartarus was the father of Typhon in thefirst place. Moreover, Homer knows norhing of this version, but placesTyphons resting place in Cilicia, in the Arimian mounrains which Zeuslashes with thunderrIn Arime, Typhon *ro;;,{*';'r!;:; droueBeneath the earth in Arime; nten saj the grave is {tillWhere tbunder tombed Typhon, beneath a mon{trous hill.Typhon still occurs as a man's name in Turkey, and the Chalybes (mistakenfor Chaldeans) worshipped the god of fire on mounrains in this region. Soonce more the Typhonian mythos reminds us of Hephastus. So too theIlames of Etna simultaneously represenr the forge of Hephastus and thebreath of Typhon. However, ovid in his Metamorythoses piles not merelyEtna but the whole island of Sicily atop Typhon: his right hand beneaththe cape named Pelorus, his left beneath the promonrory of Pachynus andhis legs beneath that of Lilybaeum. Erna in this accounr lay only upon"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":")PHIAhis head, from which he spat smoke and fame. Ovid further reckonedthe tremblings of the earth, occasioned by the struggles of Typhon to freehimself, caused Hades to visit the island. This he did to assure himselfthat there was no danger of a breach that would permit daylight to pen-etrate his dark realm. It was on the occasion of this visit that Hades sawand abducted Persephone to be his queen.There are thus strong linkages with Demeter and Persephone, withDionysus and with Hephastus, embedded in the key accounts of theTyphonian mythos. These chthonian links are also echoed in the legendof Aristaus (see Book Four) being hidden beneath Etna to preserve himfrom the slaying of the Titans by Zeus. This legend, as mentioned previ-ously, also connects Aristaus with Hephastus, since the beetle - the lo-cal equivalent of the scarab, is the Hellenistic Egyptian equivalent of theCancerian crab with its tongs. So too these amphibian tongs signified theTelchines, magical workmen of Rhodes.Typhon was the father of many notable monsters; besides being theself evident father of the Harpies in the guise of winds. He was the sireof Cerberus, Geryon and Orthos. Also, by Echidna: the Chimera, Ladon,theTheban Sphinx, the Hydra, the Sow of Crommyon, the Nemean Lionand the eagle which so tortured Prometheus. This catalogue is very remi-niscent of the ollspring of the goddess Tiamat. She was the mother ofmonsters who were the Zodiacal constellations in primitive form. Theanimal forms of the Greek gods in the Typhon myth may imply anotherversion of this motif; the Olympians themselves were after aIl associatedwith the Signs. In any case many of the monsters sired by Typhon wereencountered by Heracles in his twelve labours, often associated with thezodiac.According to Homer, Typhon lived beneath the earth in the countryof the Arimi, which Suidas took to mean the mountains and peoples ofMysia and Lydia. As interesting as this is Strabo, likely more accurately,places it in Syria; presumably near the Turkish border. This would suitthe associations with Cilicia and Mount Kasios. Virgil mistook the allu-sion and located him beneath the island of Inarime off the Campaniancoast of Italy. While Vrgil may have been practicing the legitimate ^rt"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"of elastic mythic geography, many details of the myth originate wirh theHittites; so there is no mistaking Homer's intention.In keeping with that elasticity there were two mountains known to theGreeks as Mount Casius or Kasion .In fact,locations linked with Typhonwere particularly prone to this duplication; there was a Corycian Cavein Cilicia, and another near Delphi. The primary Mount Casius is onthe border of Syria with Turkey, and has a very long sacred history. ZeusKasios is the Greek name for a succession of older Baals whose connec-tion with the place goes back millennia. The contest with Typhon un-doubtedly connects with epic battles this god had with gods of the seaand of death. Another Mount Kasios was located near Pelusium in Egypt,near a huge and very deep lake heavily impregnated with bitumen, calledtbe Serbonian bog, which once swallowed most of a Persian army. In theArgonauticaTyphon is located in this lake, rather than in Sicily. The prefixCassio that appears before some classical names indicates a dedication tothe sacred mountain and its god. Cassiopeia, the name of a constellationnamed after the mother of Andromeda is such a name.

This and associated concerns has inspired considerable debateamong scholars, and many confused and nigh unsupported statementsby otherwise competent academics. Firstly, it appears quite unjustifiedto suggest a historical equating of the biblical Seth with the god of thePapyri. Nor does Typhon-Set equare with Gnostic or occult forms ofJesus Christ, despite the linking of rhe name Aberamenthou with bothof them on separate occasions. This aside, there is no doubt whateverthat Typhon-Set was commonly identified with the sun in the Grx.co-Roman period, and not infrequently with Abraxas. Similarly, there aremany occasions whenJewish god-names occur in invocarions of Typhon-Set. Identification of both Typhon and Dionysus with the Jewish god isalso a common theme in late antiquiry. Despite asserrions by respectedreference works, I am not inclined to epiromise every insrance of this asanti-Semitism, even though such traits certainLy existed. Set had a newlyacquired demiurgic and solar-pantheistic status that was evidently sincere,this was neither necessarily or still less inevitably connected to ethnic poli-dcs. Similarly, Dionysus was a hugely popular god; identification of himwith Eastern deities is perfectly in character, even if controversial due tothe status of one in particular.What is certain is that in late pagan magic Typhon-Ser was frequentlyassociated with Jewish names and titles. This is apparenr from many rel-evant passages in the Papyd, as also from defixiones found in Rome. Thernagician in these cases is plainly more interested in conjuring his owngod than in insulting that of another nation. In modern interpretationsof the later grimoires, these names are termed Kabbalisti c; in reality, thismeans they represent a Christianised Neoplatonist view of the universe,expressed inJewish rather than pagan Greek terms. Even so, RenaissanceNeoplatonists frequently employed the names and images of the Greekgods, along with appropriate Orphic hymns."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Imputations of anti-Semitic tendencies to modern usage of these namesstrike me as erroneous; the fact is that the very norion is quite alien tomany practitioners. Similarly, magical use ofJewish god-names occasion-ally incurs accusations of cultural appropriation. Again, rhe fact is thatthese names have become traditional; it is however exrremely significantthat late pagan use of them predates similar Christian usage. While ap-parently counter-intuitive to modern sensibilities, for an ancient pagan itwas perfectly feasible to accommodate figures from henotheist or mono-theist cultures.In some cases, particularly in Asia Minor, such accommo-dation refected a deep respect for and involvement with Jewish culture,which however stopped short of conversion. On the other hand, there isno necessity to retain wholesale usage of these names; the conceptions ofdeity involved are not the sole province of any particular theology, andslavish reliance on past forms is no indication of magical competence.Having disposed of this issue in short order, the more immediately rcI-evant fact here is that Typhon-Set bore the status mentioned.In doing so,he demonstrates the mutability of views of the gods from one epoch tothe next, It is a simple fact that perceptions of the nature and attributesof any ancient deiry was subject to change. Consequently, the favouritismof one modern pagan grouping or individual for one or other past expres-sion does not render those of another wrong per se. That Typhon-SetprecededJehovah as premier detty of ceremonial magicians, often invokedunder exactly the same names, is both historically true and potentiallysignificant to various modern practitioners, and that is what matters here."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THEURGIA... an art of depraved curiosity which they either call magic or by rhemore deteftable name goeria or by the honourable title cheurgia.

To a large degree the writings of Iamblichus on Theutgy are aphilosophical appraisal of magic as it already existed rarher than a newsystem of magic. Such an interprerarion follows from viewing goetia asrepresenting, or originating within, the magical aspects of popular religionin the Hellenistic world; for it is exactly these which his work reprises andreinterprets,"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":")PHIAWhile the origins of the term goetia are in oral prehistory, eventuallyemerging in literature in the 5'l'century ncE, those of theurgy are in the 2\"'1century cr. This is not to say that no mystery attaches to the origin of theterm, or any of the concepts surrounding it. That would be very far fromthe truth. However, the origins of theurgy as a term arc relatively easy totrace, and the names of its earliest exponents are known,The first occurrence of the terms theurgy and theurgist is in referenceto Julianos the Theurgist, who fourished in the reign of the EmperorMarcus Aurelius I6t-r8o cr. This magician - for such he was - is said tohave been of Chaldean origin, and appears to have written in Greek. Heis thought to have played a major part in the composition of the ChaldeanOracles of Zoroaster; whether as author, collector or redactor is uncertain.The term theurgia is derived from two Greek words, theos meaning god,and orgia meaning work. The meaning therefore is along the lines of thedivine work, or more precisely: working witb (or upon) the gods. The obvi-ous comparison, which was probably intended, is to theologoi; from whichcomes our term theologians - from tbeo god and logoi word - those whotalk about the gods. A theurgist by contrast is one who works with orupon the gods. While not necessarily devoid of or irreconcilable with atheoretical philosophy, theurgy is a practical art.The philosophy with which it is primarily associated is Neoplatonism.However, while Theurgy originated earLiet it was not originally part ofNeoplatonism as taught by Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus or Porphyry.Theurgical principles were enthusiast ically integrated into Neoplato nismby Iamblichus; the successor of these teachers and chief of the Syrianschool. Despite this acceptance Theurgy also retained a distinct existenceas a Mystery school; Proclus, the successor of Iamblichus, was separatelyinitiated into Theurgy.Dodds, in his essay on Theurgy, makes the observation that the kind ofmagic represented by the Greek Magical Papyri used fragments of ancientreligious rites for mundane ends, while Theurgy used magical proceduresresembling those of the Papyri for religious ends. Disregarding the factthat what he takes for such fragments appea\"- to be the original composi-tions of magicians, drawing an impartial distinction between religion and"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"magic has never been easy. It is not present in the origins of the goenlwho officiated at oracles, lit sacrificial 6res and guided the dead. Equallythe combination of religious and magical roles personified by the goen isvisible in the Magical Papyri. Nor is a distinction between religion andmagic drawn in the writings of the rheurgists. What Iamblichus providesis an elucidation of magical and religious rites. They are handled withoutdistinction, within one and the same framework. Nevertheless, Dodds'observation accurately indicates the close, even intimate, correspondencebetween goetia as represented by the Papyri and the methods of the theu-rgists.As a theo retical explanation and justification of religious and magi-cal rites as a single genre, the treatise of Iamblichus is an extended com-mentary and justification of the authentic goeres, within a philosophicalframework. This is not to say there was no difference between Theurgyand what Dodds calls vulgar magic, and which the literati of the day wouldhave called goetia.Theurgy was chiefly concerned with bringing the practitioner into com-munication or union with the gods. This is the interpretation put upon itby Iamblichus; and the Chaldeon Oracles show it to have been equally trueofJulian, or those he was interpreting. Goetia was frequently turned to avariety of short term purposes, just as the ancient Oracles answered a va-riety of questions, both personal and political, many of them as mundaneas anything magic endeavoured to resolve. The philosophical frameworkprovided by Iamblichus explains how divination works, regardless of thenature of the question. In the same way the theoretical basis he providedis applicable to any magical operation, whether or not it is concerned withdivine union. However, between priest and magician, whether their artsare terrned goetia or theurgy, no necessary and often no actual division ex-ists. The concern of the operator with the divine work is central to both.Goetia - the art of the Goen, a founder and celebrant of Mysteries - is theearlier form of Thewgy; working with the gods. The short term purposesof specific magical operations should not obscure the perceived religiousrole and identity of rhe operaror. It is this role and idenrity which distin-guishes the magician, both in magical lore and popular belief."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Stephen Flowers, an occult aurhor with a firm academic background,draws a distinction between goetia and rheurgy. With him however thedistinction is one of degree: goetia is a practi cal aft, involving externalmaterials and practices; theurgy is a further srep upon the road, whenself deification has been achieved and magical processes have been inter-nalised. While his Hermetic Magic is both useful as a corrective regardingClassical goetia, and valuable for those exploring the Magical Papyri, thisdistinction is not entirely satisfactory. The classic handbook of Theurgy,Tbe Nlysteries of Iamblichus, describes a grear many operative procedures.Most typical of these is the making and empowermenr of magical stat-ues of the gods, a procedure well represented in the goeric papyri. Thiscertainly involves physical materials (particularly herbs, srones and ani-mals according to the laws of sympathia), and in the papyri it frequentlyinvolves material or mundane objectives. This was so central to rheur-gic practice as to lead Psellus to interprer rheurgy as the making of gods.This making of gods connects them with the goeren as founders of theMysteries,'such as Abaris who made the Palladium from the bones ofPelops. Indeed, the powersJulian the Theurgist and his father are creditedwith place them in direct descent from rhe goeten. There are accounts offeats of weather magic, and purifying cities from plague. They possessedthe ability to cause men's souls to leave their bodies, and it is fair ro assumethey could do so in their own right. Theurgy is essentially a reformation ofmagical religion, a restoration of archaic goeria.The idea of a magical assistant, so frequenr in the papyri, undoubtedlyprecedes the Holy Guardian Angel of Abramelin and modern occultism.The magical assistant or parhedros is often an invoked emanation of asolar pantheistic deity, again matching modern Qabalistic conceptions.Theurgical practice is also anticipated in the manufacture of magical im-ages to embody such an assistant, incorporating appropriate materials ac-cording to the laws of symparhia. In modern usage a key example of suchan image is the magical head, its seven holes reflecting the seven letters ofthe name Abraxas.Although Julian the Theurgist is the reputed founder of Theurgf, thedistinction of having penned the definitive treatise on rhe subject belongs"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"to Iamblichus. His work, known ^rt)ut) nsftries,is a response to a let-ter of Porphyry questioning the narure of magic and the rites of religion.Porphyry inquires how the various genera of higher beings are distin-guished from each other; in what they differ, and from what these differ-ences arise. Why do ceremonies take the forms they do, what in the na-ture of the gods and other entities requires such ritesi He asks also whatdivination consists of,, and what explanation there is for the active andpassive forms such arts take. How is it thar divination can be performed inconscious or unconscious states, ecstatic or sornnambulant? He enquiresinto the narure of image making in the invocation of gods.In this connec-tion arise the magical laws of Sympathia whereby plants, srones, animalsand other material objects or qualities equare with different qualities ofthe gods.Tb e Cosmology ttJ Th eurgyThe cosmological hierarchy of spiritual entities described by Iamblichusconsists of gods, the higher demons, heroes and purified souls.Subdivisions of these classes also appear in his writings: the archangels,angels, cosmocrators, archons and so forth; these are terms that representsubdivisions among the gods and higher demons. This places angels -wherever they may originate - in a philosoph icaLly pagan worldview, sub-ject both to their various planetary gods and to major pantheistic figures.Essentially all types involved in theurgical workings relate ro one or otherof the four essential categories. All rhese, gods, the higher demons, he-roes and unpolluted souls were of a higher narure than unredeemed souls,which includes the major porrion of humanity.

That is, in corroboration of the essential equivalence of goetia andtheurgy, two categories of superior being invoked in this way include theillustrious dead. While Theurgy is thought of as a dignified philosophi-cal movement, with its origins in the thought of Plato and Pythagoras,invocations of the dead constitute a form of necromancy; a term withwhich goetia is and always has been associated, An authentic invocationof an oracular hero at his cenotaph is part and parcel of the heritage fromwhich goetia as we know it has its origins. Just such respectable necro-mancy as originally distinguished the older tradition was equally at homein the magico-religious worldview of the Theurgist. This concern with themighty and illustrious dead provides the clearest possible demonstrationthat Theurgy and Goetia were in many respecrs equivalent in conceptionand application.r85"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"T'beurgic MethodsThe methods of the theurgists were several. The highest form of theurgywas divine union through pure contemplation, which was the most dif-ficult and strictLy for the few. More accessible, and in some ways moredefinitive, was the making of magically charged images of gods, incorpo-rating the methods of sympathia. Closely related to this were methods ofself-deification, often employing similar means to the making of divineimages. In addition to these modes, the theurgists practiced ritually in-duced ftat7ce - the term mediumship is best avoided in favour of proph-ecy - for the reception of divine oracles.The Theurgy of Iamblichus and the Neoplatonists explicitly involves:incantation, talismans and seals, ecstatic states and trance, the doctrine ofcorrespondences, as well as hierarchies of spirits that were deeply infuen-tial on the development of the grimoires. Despite this it is a peculiar factthat a sizeable number of modern ceremonial magicians see Iamblichus asanti'magiclThis is perhaps more connected with modern controversies -and simplifrcations - than a true appreciation of his work.There are two possible explanations for this misidentification, whichare not mutually exclusive. One is a misunderstanding of the ability of anadvanced Theurgist to dispense with ritual. This is not at all incompatiblewith far older traditions, where an advanced magician attains deificationand can dispense with the external apparatus previously essential. This at-tainment was seen as rare, and existed alongside an entirely positive viewof ritual in the writings of Iamblichus. Theurgy as developed by him pro-vided a highly infuential theoretical basis for a wide variety of ritual anddivinatory methods. That this influence reached the grimoires, of the r5'r'century and later, through such direct influences as Ficino, Mirandola andparticularly Agrippa is an evident fact. Secondly there is the controversysurrounding the use of blood; here too Iamblichus is being misunderstood.He explicitly states not that blood is forbidden or inessential, but that itis more appropriate to some beings than to others. Any blanket demoni-sation of such beings is of far later date than Iamblichus, who includesthem among tbe superior genera, Controversies over the use of blood, of"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"vegetarianism and so forth, have been presenr in mystical and magi caltra-ditions for millennia, and to srigmarise a key thinker in this way is a falseform of purism. It is false because it overlooks the eclectic and syncretictendencies at work in magical traditions. While these tendencies inevita-bly produce some internal contradictions, they also contribute decisivelyto the richness of these traditions. In any case, such contradictions willnot be overcome by the simplistic expedient of rejecting Iamblichus!Theurgy in the GrimoiresAs seen, St. Augustine refused to recognise a distinction berween Theurgyand Goetia as pracriced in the Roman Empire. That it was a false distinc-tion when the historical contexts in which the terms arose are understoodis clear enough. Nevertheless some space must be given to the fluctuationssuch terms have undergone in the later histo ry of magic. In the periodof the grimoires, and by imitation in modern magic, rhe erroneous dis-tinction is still frequently encountered and often arises from its misuse ininfluential texts. Mirandola and others asserted that Goetia operated ex-clusively by evil spirits, and that the higher magic they preferred was to bedistinguished from it. often as nor this lawful magic was clearly based onprinciples of sympathia, which has been rermed natural magic. Howeverothers, who practiced magic based on invocation, either alongside or inplace of natural symparhies, claimed to be practicing theurgy. Naturally ina Christian contexr this omitted the heroes and daemons of the old pagantheurgy; focussing mainly on angels. Agrippa referredro rhis later type oftheurgy as follows in the 46't'chapter of his De incertitude et vanitate scien-tiarum: I'Jow many think that Theurgia is not unlawfull, as ilf this be governedby good Angels, and a diuine deity, So it is that in the Lemegeton we find thebook of evil spirits referredto as the Goetia, and that of supposedly higherforces called The Theurgia of Solomon.The distinction is, of course, false; unsupportable either from the deri-vation of the words or from the texts exemplifying their use. For examplewe find one of the goetic spirits, Vassago, described as good in narure,187"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"while those of the Theurgia are described as part|y good and partly evil.This makes nonsense of the simplistic distinction underlying the classi-fication, even as redefined. In any case, going beyond this particular gri-moire, the classification is fundamentally unsound. As has been seen, theangel Cassiel frequently takes on demonic form in practice, so that usingtheurgy to refer to angelic magic swiftly exceeds the supposed bounds ofthe term. Moreover, as should be abundantly clear from the outline ofearly goetia, it was not concerned with evil spirits exclusively, and evenwhen it was frequently took the form of exorcism.The Christianised magic represented by the grimoire literature is de-rived from ancient sources, in which moralistic distinctions latterly em-ployed in the grimoires did not apply.They are similarly absent from theArab material which formed one of the major routes by which learnedantique magic reached the West. As will be seen in the Picatrix materialwhich follows shortly, the natures of the seven planetary spirits are de-terrnined by their planetary associations, rather than any moralistic divi-sion into good and evil. The spirit of Saturn (subsequently called Cassielby Christian magicians), is a thinly disguised pl,anetary god, capable ofany action consistent with his planetary nature. What makes him seemprone to contradictions in the grimoires is the theological recasting of thematerial, which is foreign to the sources; without this veneer, the thingsrequired of him are completely consistent.In closing this brief appraisal of Theurgy, an original document ofunknown date is worth presenting. The I'{uctemeron is attributed toApollonius, and certainly originally written in Greek.

He spent many years acquiring their traditions relatingto the nature of the gods and the soul. He returned for a while ro Samos,but although welcomed was disgusted by the form of government thatprevailed there. He appeared again at the Olympic games, on being rccog-nised and hailed as a Sophist or wise man he disclaimed the title, callinghimself instead a lover of wisdom, that is, a philosopher. He was the firstto call himself by this name. He then visited the republics of Sparta andElis before making his home in Crotona, a Greek colony in Italy. A localtradition claimed that Dardanos, associated with the Samothracian andPhrygian Mysteries was born there.At Crotona Pythagoras founded his school, admitting both males andfemales. This was strikingly distinct from conremporary Greek cusrom,the closest contemporary analogy being the form of sexual equality prac-ticed by the barbarian Scythians. While conventional enough in consider-ing marriage a holy role for women, he evidently esteemed female intel-ligence highly. Diogenes Laertius held that much of his system originatedwith Themistoclea, the priestess ar Delphi; famous examples of femalePythagoreans are also present in the literary record.He taught by example as well as eloquen ce, practicing an austere styleof life while discoursing upon music, healing, marhematics and naturalphilosophy. He taught a frugal and benevolent philanthropy in place ofhedonism and materialism. He paid due reverence ro the rites of the gods,whose temples he regularly visited. At an early hour of the day,hemade hisdevotions and apparently attired himself in the manner of the Egyptianpriests, making continual purifications and offerings. Herodotus, whowrote in Southernltaly near rhe site of known Orphic inrermenrs, tellsus that rhe deceased Orphic initiate is wrapped not in wool but linen.He notes this as consisrent with both Egyptian and Pythagorean practice;purification rites are also rypical of Orphic practice.

It is supposedthat he learned the use of hieroglyphic signs in Egypt, and through similarprinciples he and his followers were able to correspond, and to recogniseeach other in distant regions. He taught also that numbers underlie allthings, which together with emphasis on the number ren as perfect is adoctrine that arises later in the Qabalah.His mentor was Pherecydes, a Syrian, who was well versed in chaldeanstar-lore. The astronomical knowledge of Pythagoras is acknowledged inthe tradition that it was he who realised the identity of the Morning andEvening stars, appearing in rhe heavens at different rimes, in one planet,Venus. This tradition also represents the astronomical achievements ofGreek astrology, building on Chaldean foundations. Other Pythagoreanswere to make other significant astronomical advances,Accounts of his initiarions into Mystery cults vary; Porphyry rheNeoplatonist records a tradition that the Idaean Dactyls initiated him onthe island of Crete.

Abaris - the supposed disciple of Pythagoras who inreality predated him - had founded the temple of Persephone ar Sparta.The Dactyls were worshipped at Elis, which had been the sear of Pelops,which name recurs in association with many figures examined here. Thishero, said to be originally from Phrygia, received honours as high aboveall other heroes as Zeus above the other gods. A significant aspect of thelegend of Pelops involved him being slain, dismembered and served up tothe gods. Only Demeter, distraught due to the abduction of Persephone,did not recognise the meat as human and ate his shoulder. The gods thenrestored him to Iife, rcplacing his shoulder with one of ivory. Pythagorasis reputed to have had a golden thigh, which was a sign of his own morethan human status. The resemblance of legends such as these to shamanicinitiatory ordeals, involving dismemberment by spirits and replacementof parts of the body, is extremely striking. That the legend of Pelops in-cludes clear rcference to the Mysteries, those involving Demeter and herdaughter's Underworld experience, shows the close relation of the themeto the Mystery cults.While long well received and influential ar Crotona, in time thePythagoreans fell foul of political rivals. Molent persecution followedwith many slain, Pythagoras fled, by the best accounts, to the city ofMetapontum. Here an earlier Greek shaman, Aristeas, had founded a cultof Hyperborean Apollo.

He is cited as practicing hydromancy; as healing oth-ers by magical power; in relation to arithmancy and gematria; to rrans-migration into other bodies and of becoming a god; of absenting oneselffrom the body; of laying in seclusion to obtain prophetic power and ofsecrecy in sacred things. In all these and other marrers, Pythagoras, hisfollowers and his precepts were ever in Agrippa's mind.One particular element of Pythagorean thought in Agrippa involves theMuses and Apollo. As seen when considering the Vision of Er, Plato at-tributed the spheres of his universe to the Sirens. Pythagoras, from whomthe Music of the Spheres originates, attributed them rather to the Muses.As shown in Book Three, Agrippa delivered such an attribution from anotherwise lost Orphic source.There are also many significant reFerences ro Pythagoras andPythagorean teachings in the writings of Giordano Bruno, and as many- with as much approval but without the same degree of interest for usas in Bruno - in the writings of Pico della Mirandola.

Who were theyi The answer involves some surprises, givensome of the vague ideas that have circulated about them. Occult litera-ture and old classical dictionaries alike concur in creditingZoroaster thePersian with founding the religion of the Magi. However, firstly the Magiwere not Persians, but Medes, who had existed as a specialist religiouscaste long before the coming of Zoroaster. Rather than a founder, he wasa reformer, and the religion he wished to reform was that of the Magi.The Greek experience of Persian magic in the Persian Wars, as recordeclby Herodotus, is clearly notZoroastrian at all; it included sacrifice of hu-man beings by burying alive, as well as the more usual animal sacrifices,namely horses, both of which it is fair to assurne Zoroaster would haveopposed. In other words, the adoption of the term occurred at a point intime when the magic of the Persians as known to the Greeks was pre-Zo-roastrian. Nor was this, so to speak, an isolated case of mistaken identity.In Classical sources Zoroaster, Persia and tbe Magi are often very mislead-ing terms. They have tenuous links at best with the traditions concerned,traditions more appropriately attributed to Chaldea and Phrygia."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"GI]OSOPHIAZoroaster,like Pythagoras and orpheus, was a reformer of an ecsraricor wild religion, in his case the primirive' worship of the Devas. Persianinfluence in Asia Minor appears nor ro have reduced the cults of the oldgods; even those traditions reminiscent of Persian cults frequently havemore archaic elements.The contrast between the reputation and the reality creares problemsof urrderstanding. A tradition generally has to exist already in order to bereformed. Additionally, elements of the older tradition often persist, if in-deed it does not make a partial or complere resurgence. Such resurgencesof the older tradition are then frequently associated with the teachingsof the very reformer who may have tried to suppress them. The case ofZoroaster is one example; he apparently reformed the traditions on whichthe practices of the Magian caste were centred. However, many of theolder practices appear to have persisted, and the Magi remained an infu-ential priestly caste. A further complication is the frequent confusion ofChaldeans and Magi, with the former having much more to do with theplanetary magic of the grimoire tradition. The whole spectrum of oldertradition, reforms and later manifestations of one or both are associatedwilly-nilly with Zoroaster and rhe Magi, regardless of where the variousdividing lines may have been. Thus, the pre and post Zoroastrian Magiantraditions, as well as those of the quite separare Chaldeans and others,become extremely difficult to distinguish from one another. In such cir-cumstances, false assumptions readily arise, and later views are mistakenfor the teachings of the reformer or of his predecessors.The same situation exists in relation to Pythagoras. He is associatedwith the doctrine of reincarnation, and also with vegetarianism. It is of-ten supposed that his reforms involved rejection of animal sacrifice, sinceanimals could be reincarnated humans. There is then a temptation to as-sociate Pythagorean teachings with the Indian doctrine of reincarnationand their attendant vegetarianism; contrasting this with older Greek ritesof sacrifice. Against this interpretation there are traditions that he sacri-6ced a hundred bulls in thanks for one of his mathemarical discoveries;also that he was initiated at a Cretan sancruary, a process involving sleep-ing wrapped in the fleece of a sacrificed ram.

Despite this he traditionally credited the teachings heobtained at rhe sancruary as being totally compatible with Pythagoreanprinciples.The likeliest and readily supported resolutions of this dilemma arein keeping with the Thracian connections in the Pythagorean tradition,rather than supposed connections with India. Following this reading therewas originally no Pythagorean doctrine of reincarnation for all, this inter-pretation was a subsequent developmenr, superimposed later.

They make mosr sense as an element of the reforms intro-duced by orphic teachings. There remain the contradictions regardingPythagoras and Apollonius of Tyana, here again the Eastern 'Demerer'cult that underlay the teachings of Pythagoras is unlikely to have involveclstrict vegetarianism. While in relation to Orphisrn the relevanr sourcespoint to lifelong vegetarianism after initiation, it is not unknown even intnodern religions for particular foods to be allowed or disallowed at differ-ent points in the ritual calendar.

On the contrary, Orphism is a generalised term for avariety of analogous sects ar-rd teachings.

Shecooked the head of a sprat with its rnouth sewn up with abronze needleand sealed with pitch, and dropped wine upon it. Presumably at this pointshe spat out the beans. According ro Ovid the custom was that she drankthe rest of the wine before rising, she then declared that hostile speechhad been silenced and departed the house slightly drunk.

Their name derives from the Latin for the innermostpart of the house, where their shrine was located, identical with the fam,ily store roorn or larder, which they protected and blessed with powers ofincrease. However, the hearth was also associated with them, possibly byconflation with other similar household gods such as Vesta. Like manysuch deities they are in reality older than the gods of the city or the srare.However as the state was conceived of as a greater family there were alsostate Dii Penares, and the two should be distinguished although they areevidently related.The conception of the Dii Penates of the state and home was influencedby Greek cities in Southern Italy on Roman tradition. Accordingly theywere seen as rwo young men and associated with the cabiri (the theoimegaloi or great gods of Sarnothrace), and thought to have been broughtfrom Troy by Aeneas. l{ence Virgil's expression: tbe bome gods and gredtgods. They were soffretimes portrayed as seared, somerimes dancing andoccasionally holding spears. As household gods of the state they were ofrenassociated with Vesta, goddess of the hearth.

Images of the Penates could be of wax orearth, superior versions being of silver or ivory. Th\"y received offeringsof wine, incense and fruits, and occasionally a sacrifice of lambs or sheep,and also goats. When these offerings were made they were garlanded andadorned with garlic or poppies, the last particularly suggesting chthonicconnections. Their rites occurred during the festival of Saturnalia. It isnot uncommon to find them identified with the Lares, but while confu-sion existed among the Romans themselves the two are distinct, as thelocation of their shrines and other details makes clear.Lares FomilidrisScarce had he fnisbed, wben, with Secl<.Ied pride,A serpent Jrom the tomb began to glide;His hugy bulk on seuen higb uolumes rolled,BIue was his breadth of back, but {treaked with scaly gold.Tbus, riding on his curls, he seemed to passA rollingfre along, and singe tbe grass.The Lares were Roman spirits attached to any and every household.

In the later phase thedomestic spirits were seen as a pair rather than a single spirit as before.It was once commonly assumed that the Lares were ancestral spirits, as-sociated with the ancient practice of burying ancestors beneath the house.This assumption likely derives in part from the ancient connection of theLars with the Manes. However, it now appears more likely that the LarFamiliaris was identical with the Genius Domus (see my True Grimoirefor what appears to be an important Solomonic use of this term). Thesewere a form of domestic Genius Loci, similar in nature to the brownie oflater folklore (see discussion of Luridan the familiar in Book Six: VolcanicCon-iurations). As they were associated with a dwelling place the name ofthe spirit was also applied to the house itself. Some images resembledmonkeys and were covered with dogskin, at their feet was placed the im-age of a barking dog in token of their care for and vigilance over the safetyof the house; once the idea of a pat of Lares had arisen they were oftenrepresented as a pair of dancing youths similar to the Curetes. Ovid re-fers to them as the night watchmen in his Fasti, which term translates thename of the Wrum spirit Bucon, just as Penates connects with the nameof the spirit Pentagnony (The True Grirnoire),In the private cult of the household images of the Lares were placed ina shrine known as a sacrarium or lararium, these niches were situated be-hind the door of the house or at the hearth. These were frequently deco-rated with paintings of snakes, similar to the housel-rold spirits of ancientGreece; a r.vell preserved example may be seen at Pompeii. They receivedofferings at mealtimes when a small statue was placed on the table, andincense was frequently burned at their altar. Greater offerings, involvingthe sacrifice of a sow, fruit and garlands were made in May, they receivedofferings too at the Kalends, Ides and Nones and on the birthday of thehouseholder.

These deities were two in number andhonoured by the entire local community. It appears that they were rwo innumber due to the meeting of two roads. In myth, they were the childrenof Mercury and Lara, also known as Larunda. Larunda was an under-world goddess of the old Roman religion and was also called Muta orTacita in token of the silence of the dead. Her name of Mania is bestowedupon her as mother of the Manes, while Larunda may well connecr herwith the Lares. The ritual of the Feralia described earlier involved her, andthe connections of that rite with silence are evidently appropriate to her.Originally seen as the mother of the spirits of rhe dead, the later Romanmythographers connected Lala with the Greek lalein connected withspeech, even gossip. In an attempt to explain the former meaning of silentthey invented a story whereby the godJupiter was enamoured ofJuturnaand since she spurned him he requested the complicity of the nymphs,but Lala refused her help and informedJuno of his intentions. Enraged byher actionsJupiter cut out her tongue and instructed Mercury to conducther to the underworld to remain a water nymph but of the world below.Mercury, evidently in his own chthonic role, became enamoured of Lalain turn and from their union arose the twin spirits known as the Lares.Their nature was similar in nature ro Mercury himself, as in the myth in"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"question he conducted souls to rhe Underworld, thus the Etruscan rermconductor underlines their chthonic narure,The infuence of these spirits extended not only to the crossroads butalso to the general neighbourhood. Their association with the crossroadsconnects them to traditions of magic from ancient times through theMiddle Ages to the traditions of the New world and on ro contemporarymagic.The connection of the household Lares with Mercury and the LaresCompitales has sorne important undertones that require underlining.The original Roman Mercury is often said to differ markedly from theClassical Hermes; however, the Lares in ftaly may well connect withthe primitive Hermes via either Etruscan influence, which has links toAsia Minor and the Mystery cults, or the early migration of Greeks toSouthern Italy. The supposed Greek equivalent of the Roman Mercury,Hermes, was anciently represented by a phallus. A Roman legend makesKing Servius Tullius the son of a Lares Familiaris and a slave of Tarquin,named Tanaquil. The Lares is said to have arisen from the hearth in theform of a phallus made of ash.WstaThe Goddess of the hearth , and particularly of its flame, Vesta closelyresembles the Greek Hestia in name and function, However her cult wasancient in Italy long prior to the period of Greek colonisation, this sug-gests a common origin in Indo-European traditions. The later mytholo-gists connect her with the most ancient goddesses, such as Rhea or Cybeleas well as Demeter, Persephone and Hecate. Although these connecrionsare late these goddesses share genuinely archaic features. Thus despite herfamous vftginity Vesta is associated with the Great Mother of the Gods,and is a goddess of fire.The original custom of honouring her with an ever burning frre in thehousehold was later extended to the city and to the state.

The cusrom oftransplanting fire gave rise to the Roman notion that their cult - and thesacred 6re - had originated in more ancient Latin settlements. This ideawas subsequently extended as the idea of a tojan origin arose.The sacred fire of Rome and other Latin cities was tended by a collegeof virgin priestesses, who dwelled in the Atrium Vestae. The word atriumindicates the open central room of a Roman dwelling, the forecourt of atemple and the hall of any other building. The Atrium of the Vestals wasnot inside the city but at its forecourt. Excavations of the site point to acontinuation of primitive customs. The shape of the building was round,like the earliest Latin huts. It commernorated the outline of a chieftain'shut, whose daughters the Vestals would originally have been, with theduty of tending the fire on behalf of the community. While the public cultwas the responsibility of these Vestal Virgins, the private cult of Vesra wascontinued in every home,At the Vestalia in mid-June (June 9d' old calendar) the ladies of the citywalked barefoot in these processions to rhe temple of Vesta. Banquetswere prepared in front of every house, and millstones were garlanded.The young donkeys which turned these srones on orher days were gar-landed with fowers and did no work, but were paraded around the city. AGreek inspired explanation of this was rhar the goddess was saved fromthe amorous advances of the phallic god Priapus by the braying of an ass.It is necessary to note however that the ass was rhe beast most closelyassociated with Priapus.

Shehas a relationship, perhaps ro rhe point of identity, with another goddessnamed Cloacina, originally associated with purificarion by a Roman river,who became goddess of the Roman sewers, without, strangely, sufferingdevalued status in the process. Due to this relationship perhaps, as wellas her name, Caca became associated with excremenr. Leaving Cloacinaaside, the fact is that Caca was initially quite different, a goddess of thehearth frre who may well be more ancient than Vesta herself. Few traces ofher ancient cult remain, having been assimilated by Vesta. However thereare significant elements in her myrh, more particularly those involving herbrother Cacus. The details of his myth converge with topics arising else-where in this study, and contain interesting pointers to archaic rites andthe nature of more important gods.According to the best known Roman myth her brother was a son ofVulcan named Cacus. He was a three headed fire breathing giant, anda dangerous robber in ancient Italy; his mother according ro some wasthe snake-haired Medusa. He dwelled in a cavern stronghold whichJohnDryden's translation of Virgil describes thus:The mon{ter Cacus, more than haf a bea{t,This bold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.The pavement euer foul witb human gore;Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.Vulcan this plague begot; and,lil<e his sire,Black clouds he belcb'd, and Jlakes of livid Jire.Legend has it that he stole some of the cattle which Hercules was drivingthrough Italy (having himself stolen them from anorher three headed gi-ant named Geryon). Cacus showed cunning in concealing his crime, drag-ging the cattle backwards into his cave so the hoof prints seemed to leadaway from it. The ruse was betrayed either by the lowing of the cattle or"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":")PF{IAby the treachery of Cacus sister, the hearth goddess Caca who had fallenin love with Hercules. Hercules then either defeated Cacus witlr his club,or according to another version, when Cacus closed the entrance to hiscave with srones Hercules tore off the top of the mountain and killedhim. King Evander then purified Hercules of the murder and made himwelcome. The keeping of a perpetual fame in honour of Caca is supposedto derive from this incident, but a perpetual fame would abeady havebeen her attribute. Hercules supposedly founded rites at Rome in honourof this feat, which Carmenta refused to attend. Thereafter women wereexcluded from the rites.By this account Cacus was an unpleasant fellow, but there are strongrraces of other quite different traditions about him. An Etruscan mirrordepicts Cacus as a long-haired young prophet with a lyre singing whatmust be a rhyming prophecy which his pupil records in writing in an en-igmatic script. Behind the pair are two armed warriors approaching in-tent on capturing them. This theme is not uncommon in classical lore; itresembles the capture of Proteus and other figures to force an unwillingoracle. Another tradition, probably late, links Cacus with Marsyas, whohas escaped the cruelty of Apollo and invaded Italy; significantly, given thedepiction of Cacus as a prophet above, this tradition credits Marsyas withthe invention of augury. The same traditions link him with free speechand the rights of the lower classes. The freedom implicit in the popularDionysian cults are here clearly contrasted with aristocratic tyranny rep-resented by Apollo. Statues of Marsyas were the gathering place for popu-lar demonstrations, and the Phrygian cap is still known as a liberty capto this day. Another tradition concerns a man of great strength, namedCacius, who lived on the Palatine Hill and entertained Hercules. Takentogether these traditions suggest Cacus may not be as black as he is paint-ed; on the contrary he and his sister appear to be Italian frre deities withoracular functions and Etruscan connections.It is perhaps not impossiblethat Cacus has some relation to the prophet Calchas, whose cult certainlyreached ItaLy; while purely speculative the alteration in his name could bedue to Etruscan usage."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Another frgure who is plainly related ro Cacus, at the very least as halfbrother and possibly identical with him is Caculus. The myths surround-ing Caculus are contradictory, and rr.ay refr.ect the changing relationshipof Rorne with the city he is said to have founded, Praneste. This was oneof the most ancient towns of Latium, zr miles South East of Rome. Fromaround +gg BCE it was allied ro Rome, but after the coming of the Gaulsbecame one of its enemies until assimilation after the Social War. An im-portant and famous feature of the city was the oracle of Fortuna. Theoracle was consulted by drawing lots known as Pranestinae sortes, Thelots were written in ancient characrers upon small pieces of wood keptin an olivewood chest and consultation consisted of randomly extractingone of these, which provided the answer. The foundation myth of the citycomes in two forms: the Greek form is interesting enough, attributingits foundation to Telegonus, son of Odysseus and the sorceress Circe, orhis supposed grandson Pranestus. The other version is the older and at-tributes its foundation to Caculus, son of Vulcan.The legend of Caculus is that two shepherds named the Depidii livednear the site of Praneste. A spark frorn their fire few into the lap of theirsister who conceived Caculus. In some versions the girl is said to haveabandoned the child near the temple ofJupitea bur he was found besidea fire by local wonen who broughr him to the brothers, who raised him.Tlrese brothers were dii indigetes, ancient indigenous ltalian deities, andappear to be a form of Lares or Penates. Caculus' name is said to meanblind (caeco) for the smoke from the fire had made his eyes water. Thisseems to be a rationalisation, and since his name appears also as Ceculusthere can be no certainty about the derivation. His name may equallyderive from the related term cc4ecus which has the additional meaning ofinvisible or secret.'Vulcanian Caculus'grew up as a famous robber and gathered somecompanions to him with whom he built Praneste. A multitude gatheredfor the spectacle but he was unable to convince rhem to become citi'zens.

According ro the legend as givenby Virgil, Caculus was born in a fire, a'd subsequenrly fought againstAeneas. As Aeneas is the legendary founder of the state this probably rep-resents the conflict between Pranesre and Rome. More imporrantly therole of Vulcan in the legend of Caculus reflects his role as the god of thecity hearth.That the heroes Caculus and Cacus are strongly linked is evident. Notonly are their narnes similar, but both are sons of Vulcan, both are'rob,bersi both are connected with oracles and Evander appears in both theirlegends. Conflict with Pranesre may have devalued some forms of thegod, and may also account for Carmenta's refusal to attend rhe rites ofHercules if she was the oracular goddess of rhe rival ciry. However an-other factor that should be considered is the role of \\A.rlcan himself, Afire god, he differed from Vesta in representing destructiv e fire, ratherthan the kindly and sacred hearrh. It appears likely that his sanctuary theVolcanol, common in Italian towns including Rome, was for propitiatoryofferings against fire.

In accordance wirh this, whennot standing or moving a squatting or seated posture is appropriate.Innge staditionally, and practically, one of the best ways to communicate withspirits involves images of them placed in a suitable shrine. A cabinet withcupboard space below and shelves above is a very suitable basis for such ashrine. Images typically take two forms, one is a clay head, and the other isa statuette. Preferably these will be handmade aud consecrated, althoughan Ellegua head may be obtained from a Botanica or suitable mail ordersupplier. Instructions for consecrating clay may be found in the Key ofSolomon.In many cases whether a statuette or a head is chosen the imagewill contain various items, be they appropriate herbs, seven coins or otherthings.

These will generally consistof fire and water, as well as food if appropriate. By fire is meanr candlesand incense, and by water fresh water. Some spirits require these daily,others weekly, and this can be ascerrained by divinarion, or performed ac-cording to traditional procedure. Candles are generally offered in thanksfor a favour, while warer and incense are offered more regularly to main-tain the link and feed the spirits. A good idea when perforrning such of-ferings to goetic spirits is to consecrate the warer and 6re in the name ofthe ruler of these elements in the hierarchy concerned.

Very often particular entities have particular preferences,such as popcorn and seven types of beans for Omolu; other food offeringsmay be deduced from systems of correspondences, such as hot foods forMartial and square saffron cakes forJovial entities.These aspects aside, there are other aspects of sacrifice that can be use-fully discussed. Goetic rites in classical Greece drew upon more archaictraditions, and in various ways these are still implicit or explicit in thetradition as it survives today.In the Christian period the term goetia oftenindicated suspect magical practices connected again to older traditions,those surviving from paganism. Consequently, goetic offerings and riteswere - and still are - often deeply conservative in nature. For example,offerings of wine, a comparatively recent innovation in classical times,were not made to older chthonic deities. Barley beer or some older formwas preferred, the feeling being that the older rites should be retained forcertain kinds of entity, many of whom have precise parallels in moderngoetic work. Although the specific example given above may not hold truefor the entities with which the modern conjurer works, similar cases andattitudes very well may.As a part of my own work, for instance I make a point of buying up oldcoins to serve as offerings. Although most of these are pre-metric Englishpennies,I also keep some exotic coins, whether foreign or unusual in someway. These come into use in various waysr as permanent offerings on aritual shrine, or as sacrifice fees, paid by burying in the earth when collect-ing items from outdoors at various appropriate locations. These bbsolete'sacrifices reflect the fact that some of the spirits are old, whether spirits ofthe dead from an earlier time, or gods and nature spirits of earlier phasesof culture, whether oLrr own or other's. These coins of course involve asacrifice in several respects: not only has modern money been earned andspent to obtain them, but very often specific journeys have been made,and time and energy expended, in order to exchange modern currency forolder coins.On the other hand, modern coins such as two pence coins may serveperfectly well on occasion. They may be pressed into the earth when achance find is made, or ofFered to a more recent ghost.

For example a numberassociated with the spirit may determine the number of coins.Intermecli,try Entities in Goctic RituolAnother consideration of great importance is the presence in many spirirhierarchies of an ir-rtermediary spirit who must be dealt with first in orderto contact the others. This may well influence the structure of offeringsas well as conjuration. Generally the intermediary spirit musr be workedwith {irst, in order for offerings to reach orher spirits on rhe shrine.In my ritual work I am in constant contact with the intermediary spiritof the Grimorium Wrum,whose name is Scirlin.

In many respectsScirlin acts in the same way as the Holy Guardian Angel in other sup't-posedly transcendental systems. His role is also very sirnilar to importanrintermediary spirits in African Traditional Religions, as well as Ganeshain Hinduism, and so forth.There are several devotional aspects to this frequent contacr. Sorne ofthese are true of other spirits as well, but are naturally emphasised in rhisparticular relationship. One exarnple is that Scirlin possesses propertp inthe form of gifts and offerings of a permanent narure.

To illustrate, whenever I move horne, which inrecent years has been fairly frequent, one of my 6rst actions is to explorethe area thoroughly. In particular I am on the loclkout on such excursionsfor the locatiorr of nearby crossroads, as many as possible; for cemeteries;particular trees and plants; for watercourses, both streams and rivers.Watercourses are important for provision of differing types of water asdefined in ritual, and also potentially for clay, useful in making images anclvessels. Crossroads are important fbr the disposal of ritual ephemera, bethey residues of operations, or the spells themselves. When disposing ofsomething at a crossroads it is important to consider whether you wishthe effect of the spell to remain rvith you, or to be distant from you, asthis deterrnines which side of the crossroads it is put. Crossroads are alsoimportant locations for various offerings and even some conjurations.Cemeteries are useful for a variety of reasons, and are places I visitfairly frequently. Once again, my activities should not be confused withSatanism, particularly the variety that embraces any form of vandalism.Cemeteries are the abodes of spirits the magician wishes to be on goodterms with, and mistreating their home is unlikely to have such an eflect.On the contrary, I often pay a ritual fee on entering a cemetery, and alsopay the spirits if I take anything away with me, or if I bring somethingwith rne and leave it behind.

The subject was a magical ritual perforrned in the bathroom,a location of considerable importance in the religion. Many Santeros havea shrine in their batlrrooms to the Eguns, spirits of the dead includingancesrors. It is also an irnportant location in initiation rituals. By contrast,a well-known modern Kabbalistic writer used to include a reguest not totake his books into the bathroom, as they contain narles of God, and todo so is disrespectful. Here,I thought, is a separation of the ways; whicb ismost important to me? Is tbe cuhural context oJ one more appropriate than theother? While Kabbalah has immense prestige in modern magic, the prac-ticalities of magic in the home environment - where most ritual baths willtake place - make this taboo problernatic; additionally, comparing NewWorld traditions with the Western strand as I am doing here is a far moreproductive approach.My chain of thought moved swiftly onwards; Kabbalah and the moreobvious systems of correspondences in Western magic include no attribu-tion of bathroom or other parts of the house. Where else might I find one?As rhe reader rnay have gathered, the roots of astrology are intrinsicallymore pagan than is Kabbalah; partially explaining why Albertus Magnusconsidered many aspects of astrology to be necromantic. Although manyparts of its pagan heritage are massively overlaid or obscured, they arefar from lost. Accordingly, I resorted to a handbook of horary astrologyconcerned with flnding lost objects; including clear guidelines for locatingsaid item, in whatever part of the house it rnay have been mislaid.

In rhis conrexr, hepresides over puri{ication and elimination of dross.

Pour water: rainwater if you are calling uponheavenly gods, seawater if gods of the earth, river water if Osiris orSarapis, $ringwater if the dead...Other references from Egypt support this classification, Seawater beingascribed to Set and river water to Osiris. The role of Osiris in Egyptianrnagic and popular belief seems to have differed from orthodox religiousbelief, In rnagical beliefs he was pre-eminently Lord of the Underworld,and the chief of many demons (or fighter and guardian spirits), poten-tially dangerous to humans and of course potentially useful to magicians.(Sarapis is a Hellenistic Egyptian Lord of the Underworld with manyattributes of Osiris).The classification appears to hold good in later grimoires, several exam-ples appearing in Verum and in its relative Liber Troisiime."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"I]AMII-IAR & UNFAIVIILIAR SPIRI'I'SRainwater has no exarnples inWrum,but then it isnt calling on heavenlygods!

Stonesfrom a river are used to weigh down the skin during the parchmenr mak-ing proces s in \\,'erum, and the Underworld associations of the location islikely significant. Springwater is used in the conjurarion of Uriel - a rirewith strong resemblances to Egyptian bowl divination. The'angel'Urielis certainly a dark and ambiguous figure both in the grimoires and in an-gelology; he frequently represents saturnine and chthonian energies, andhis name is likely to be a cover for darker entities, particularly Lucifer(Uri\"l means Light of God, Lucifer Light bearer. He has various aliases inangelology too, such as Phanael the Angel Guardian who was conjuredinto a crystal in Book Three.Thus, this particular rite suirs re-crafting in a variety of ways, choosingdifferent waters and spirits for other purposes, jusr as in the Egyptian ex-ample. Similarly when crafting new spells, for example with the standardWrum talisman form and spirits whose narure suited the task in hand, useof water of an appropriate type could be among the considerarions.Given the instructions for manufacturing artiGcial seawarer in LiberTroisiime some of my readers will perhaps be seeking spring-water attheir local supermarket, and there is no prohibition against such initiative.On the other hand, exploring local geography as a magical resource is asource of power and insight, Local crossroads, springs, cemeteries, sourcesof plants etc. are signilicant in the lifb of goetic magicians.Finally, how Western or traditional is this? Well, firstly the papyri, andEgypt, form a genuine basis for much of the magic of the West. Secondly,though traditional Western magic went into decline for centuries andmuch has been lost, there are many traces still extant which can be revital-ised, of which this is undoubtedly one. When such associations and cor-respondences are second nature - at our fingertips - they add great rich-ness to magical culture, so that the term tradition gains meaning. Tracesof bur'magic are to be found in unsuspected places. For example, thosefamiliar with Palo practices will have encountered the collecting of dirt"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"GEOSOPT'I IAor soil frorn different locations: dirtfrom seven banks, seuen police-stations,seven prisons etc. Very similar lists of magical soil have been found in ac-counts of Spanish magicians of the seventeenth century, one of whom haddirt sw,eptfrom tlte three prisons oJ Madrid, alongwith graveyard dirt and soon. So while these items are thought of as belonging to New World magic,they may equally be survivals of Western magic preserved by another cul-ture with considerable contact with the older one.Papyrus parallels, which underlie and reconnect the magic of both thegrimoires and Hoodoo, are very numerous, and invaluable.

This included the technical Hermetica of theMagical Papyri. The Nabatean Arabs, who had been in close contact withthe Roman world, were but one Arab culture for which astrological rnagicwas a major part of their religion. The Sabians of Harran were among themost influential of these Hermetic Arab communities, and their learningwas to make huge contributions to the development of the Moslem world.They were adept astrologers and their cultus was closely akin to the laterastrological magic of the grimoires, but as the expression of a srar basedreligion. Mecca itself was saturated in such lore prior to Islam; accordingto tradition, 1,65 astrological statues embellished the city.While I have given due credit to Chaldea, Syria and Asia Minor, theearlier Middle Eastern cultures have been largely examined via the Greekfilter by which their contributions reached the West. To a degree, I in-tend to compensate for that emphasis here. After the fall of the WesternRoman Empire the Arab world was the principal heir of much of thelearning and magic of the Graco-Roman world. Certainly the EasternRoman Empire, called Byzantine by Western wrirers, preserved a greatmany Classical manuscripts, The fall of this power, and the access gainedto its learning were undoubtedly a major cause of the Renaissance in Italy.Nevertheless, the attitude of the Byzantine authorities to magical lore was"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"GE()SOPHIAambivalent at best, and viciously intoleranr ar its worsr. The Arab worldby contrast was a more conducive environment not only for the survivalbut also for the further development, of the Classical inheritance.The period of Islamic expansion, particularly in Spain, was rhe route bywhich much of this lore was 6rst regained by the West. This process wasfurther accelerated by their defeat and the abandonment of their libraries;containing Greek and Arab works. Ptolemy's Almagest was just one suchbook important to occultism. This rvas translated by Gerard of Cremona;lre to whom is attributed a treatise on Geomancy in the Fourth Booh. Thisinfusion of pagan learning, including the sopl-risticated Hermetic theoryof magic, was the primary medieval source for the material in the grimoi-res, prior to the sack of Byzantium. While Christian in appearance thegrimoires as magical manuals were vety largely dependent on pagan lore.As such it was dependent on learning transmitted first by the Arab world,and subsequently the Byzantine.Of particular importance in the process of transmission, alongsidemany other Greek, Latin and Arabic rexrs, was rhe colossal compendiumof magical lore known as the Picatrix.Among the many key elemenrs rhatit transmitted was a wealth of Sabian lore, the prayers attributed to themin the Picatrix have been shown to be genuine rites of their astrologicalcultus. Such lore is also the major source for conjurarions of planetaryspirits in the Western grirnoires; regardless of how and whether rhesewere crudely reinterpreted as angels, demons &c.The astrological images, which the Picatrix rransmitted to Wesrern oc-cultism, reach back to Indian, Babylonian and Graco-Roman originals.ThePicatrix, in short, is a major example of the transmission of Hellenisticmagic to the Western world, from the ro'l'century AD onwards. Its influ-ence on the grimoires, and on major occult thinkers such as Ficino andAgrippa has been demonstrated beyond any doubt by modern historicaltechniques.The materials included in this survey are a small fraction of the Classicalinheritance transmitted by the Picatrix.

As willbe seen, such rites were the evident forerunners of the astrological magicfamiliar to Western magicians from the grimoires (i.e. the Heptameron,the Ke1, of Solotnon &c.); where operations attributed to the seven planetshave colour, gem, metal and animal correspondences as an integral practi-cal base). The Picatrix faithfully records many aspects of Sabean ritual;just such colour correspondences &c. were present in the astrologicalriruals they performed. This is to say the least of it, as among them wereprodigiously learned astrologers and mathematicians integral to the ad-vancement of Islamic learning and its influence. The Picatrix is a directforerunner and a powerful influence on grirnoire magic, both directly andthrough the lens of writers such as Agrippa.In some specific respects, Sabean ritual differs from those most com-monly described in the Solomonic texts although parallels are traceableelsewhere, especially in French grimoires. Examples of these are prostra'tions and widespread ar-rimal sacrifice. The latter is mentioned constantly,and there are examples besides of human sacrifice. In The Golden Bough,Frazer, whose account matches similar descriptions elsewhere in thePicatrix, describes bloody rituals of the Sabeans:The heathen of Harran offered to the sun, moon, and plar-rets humanviCtims who were chosen on the ground of tl-reir supposed resemblanceto the heavenly bodies to wl-ricl'r they were sacrificed; for example, thepriedts, clothed in red and smeared rvith blood, offered a red-haired,rcd-cheeked rnan to'the red planet Mars' in a temple which was paint-ed red and draped with red hangings.

In the case ofMercury, the victim is multi-coloured in keeping with the colour corre-spondences retained in the grimoires. In every case, the liver of the victimis consumed as a sacrament. This may involve similar ideas to methods ofdivination from examination of the liver; the Romans inherited this fromthe Etruscans, who are thought to have originated in Asia Minor.Astrology and the GodsAlbertus Magnus in his Speculum Astronomiae spoke of necromantic ele-ments in astrology, and cited the Solomonic books among his examples(see The True Grimoire p. ry7).The removal of pagan magic from astrologywas a major concern of the medieval Church. Via the Picatrix the magic ofSolomon and Agrippa's astrological magic derive directly from Chaldeanand Hellenistic magic, as evident in the magical papyfi.Just as modernastrology results from Greek sysremisarion of Syrian and Babylonian srar-lore, so the source of these elements in Western magic is Graco-Roman.The above analogy is precise, in the Picatrix we see rogerher elemenrsdirectly comparable to whar we see separately in Solomonic grimoiresand modern astrological manuals. The recombination of these elemenrs,to fully regenerate the traditions latent in western magic, is most readilydone from a classical pagan perspective. Of course Jewish, Christian orIslamic traditions arc alI adaptable as masks, through angelology; that ishow they obtained the form in which we posses them. The nineteenthcentury occult revival performed a similar masking with Egyptian godforms, a precedent for which existed in Graco-Egyptianmagic. Behind allthese masks however lurks a synthesis of Greek and Babylonian rhought,of which astrology rather than Cabala is the primary model. In any case,the aspects of Cabala utilised in Western occultism generally represenr anabridged and simplified form of astrological symbolism, for which how-"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAever it is a less effecdve substitute. Astrology permeated the origins anddetermined many subsequent developments of Western magic. The pub-lic relations office of the Chaldean magi should congratulate themselveson first rate infiltration and subversion of the Graco'Roman mind, andthus of the Western magical tradition as a whole.As indicated before, the colossal pantheon of Greek myth is not a rruerepresentation of local cults with their far smaller dramatis personae.This is equally true of the cultures with which Greece was in conrac,and should be carefully borne in mind when considering astrology as rheprimary syncretic model on which the Western magical tradition was for-mulated from various cultural models.In the interwoven cultural contextsof the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East, the celestial gods and theplanets do not stand in fixed relation to one another. Nor have they alwaysthe same claim to local affections; the god Baal may be most popular inone place asJupiter or the Sun, a father or a young man. Similarly the god-dess Baalit may manifest as Moon or Venus, and be popular in one placeas a mother and another as a virgin. A goddess, young or mature, mighrbe associated with the Sun; equally, the Moon could be associated with agod, Apollo or Men a young Moon god, or Sin a father. Nergal could beMars or the Sun, and very possibly lunar besides.So, the planets and gods are not in fixed relation, but they are two veryclosely related sets of categories. The very adaptability of their intercon-nected relations permits fexibility, but also demands it of us. While dis-tinct, these intevrelated categories live parallel lives: father, son, motherand daughter inter-relate constantly with solar, lunar, planetary and ch-thonic symbols.

These run contrary to the general advice given, forexample, by Agrippa, let alone some of the simplified concepts in currentuse. The Libra working above requires a copper bow made when Venus isretrograde in Taurus, with Mercury in Aries. By some lights, retrogradeplanets are not sought for but avoided, and Mercury has no dignity inAries. In the next chapter, dealing with the Lunar Mansions, exceptionto avoidance of combust planets is found, there it is advocated as usefulin operations of the bad. An astrological talisman in Greer and Warnockttranslation of the Latin Picatrix involves another exception; a cursing im-age is made with the Lord of the Ascendant cadent, a weak position. Theimage is then buried at a crossroads while the Moon is in Via Combusta.Originally, this meant between 19 Libra and 3 Scorpio, the opposite po-sitions of the exaltations of the Sun and Moon. Later the measure wasconventionalised, from r5 degrees of one sign to the same number of theother.

The data on which it isbased is c. ro'1'cE and by -y reading depends in part on 6xed star positionsthat no longer apply due to precession. As it stands the cusps also de6nepoints that remain in use, such as said Critical Degrees, and of course theSolsticial and Equinoctial points. To facilitate updated adaptation withappropriate matedals, I have tabulated some current positions of princi-pal Fixed Stars &c in relation to the Mansions as defined by Lillys CriticalDegrees and earlier convention. Rheinhold Ebertin, one of the greatest2o'h century astrologers, worked with stars all over the world by relatingtheir position to the Ecliptic rcgardless of distance from it (thus Polarisis associared wirh 27.5+ Gemini). His theoretical premise, which has an-cient precedent, relates stars not visible in various parrs of the world to rhelocality. Stars outside the Northern Hemisphere - such as the SouthernCross - arejust as appropriare ro rhis schema. In effect, this provides abasis for both global and local approaches.267"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Mansiono Ariesrz Ariesz5 Aries8 Tauruszr Taurus+ Gemini17 Geminio Cancero Cancerz5 Cancer8 LeozrLeo4Yirgory Yirgoo LibraAlgol z6:ro TaurusPleiades z9 Taurus - oo GeminiDetail of ZodiacEquinox o AriesAldebaran 9:38 GeminiGoat Star zo;28 GeminiSolsticeGreater and Lesser Dog StarB:52 &. z+iz+ CancerAlphecca Io:53 ScorpioAntares 9 SagittariusDragons Eye z6:35 SagittariusSolsticeVega ry:55 CapricornRegulus zg:4rLeoAlkaid z53rYirgoEquinoxGienah roi++ LibraoLibra Spica 23:42 LibraArcturus z+:ooz5Libra8 Scorpiozr Scorpio4 Sagittariusr7 Sagittariuso Capricornrz Capricornz5 Capricorn8 Aquariuszr AquariusDeneb Algedi zz AquariusFomalhaur 3i52 Pisces4 Piscesr7 Pisces"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"ASTROLOGICAL TALISMANSf hese figures are referred to particular astrological conditions, under theI circumsrances described herein one works for the purposes which thetalismans are applicable to.Talismanfor tbe expulsion of miceone draws the signs shown on a copper plate ar the outgoing of the 6rstdecan of Leo.

Naturally, the author of this material was not Aristotle, butthe appeal to Greek authorities is sincere enough."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"That the symbol of Saturn should bear a sickle is natural, while an en-throned Jupiter is equally expected. These are pictures of the classicalgods. Mars'lion is not typically Greek, though the association of the beastto Nergal is certainly appropriate.While there are examples that are more classical elsewhere in thePicatrix, the solar image is intriguing. The heroic spearman and the cen-taur suggest Achilles and Chiron, or indeed the initiation of any such hero.In the image of Venus holding an apple we have an allusion to rhe triumphof Aphrodite in the Judgement of Paris, an icon older than the Homericoccurrence of it. This is a classic talisman, and Catherine de Medici pos-sessed one with this image its principal motif, surrounded with additionalmagical characters.Grimoire aficionados will note the resemblance of these images to theplanetary talismans found in Le Petit Alberf, Another resemblance is im-portant to take away from this study into modern practice. This is the re-semblance of such images of the gods to some species of clay or casr metalvotives once obtained for offering at pagan temples. Once this is noted, itbecomes very apparent that talismans and such votives have a substantialamount in common. While modern occultists generally think of talismansas occult j ewellery, or as items carried on the person, the Picatrix conrainsmany formulae that broaden this view. Talismans are equally a pa.t ofimage magic and general spell work. It is perfectly appropriate to add thevotive function to talismans when operaring within apaganframework orindeed simply a more'spirit friendly'ritual conrexr.The votive is generally understood as involving positive favours, butthis too is but part of their range, Avery common spell type in the an-cient world, with many archaeological examples from Alexandria throughRome to the English city of Barh and beyond, is the defixione. This isessentially a negative vorive, frequently inscribed on lead. The choice ofthis material involves many considerations, besides the association withmalefic planets (the Picatrlx ascribes lead to Mars; the usual ascription isto Saturn). It was rcadiIy obtained, stolen from piping for example, andcould be easily written on. Rolling up for placing in a crack in a wall ortomb was a typical means of deposit , and lead sheet favours this practice."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"A drawn image of a god or daimon as well as a written spell underlinesthe connection with votives, as does the depositing of the defixione at atemple, or in a grave or even a bathhouse. These did not ask for positive fa-vours, but for retribution, or defeat or other misfortune to befall a victim.The targets ranged from thieves ro opponents in politics, to rival reams arthe chariot races. Some locations were so favoured for deposiring thesethat excavation occasionally locates dozens at a single place. Incidentallyone reason lead may have been associated with Mars is the astrologicalrule of elemental water by this planet.The colours listed in this section are similar to those of the grimoires,with a couple of exceptions, green forJupiter and pale rose red for Venus,the latter suggesting the not infrequently found pink, as in candles for lovemagic in Hoodoo.The thinking behind the incenses is evidently the source of similar ideasin western grimoires, and we may be certain which end of the spice tadethey originate. The use of such ingredients to manufacrure inks is hope-fully sufficiently interesting to justify the inclusion of the remainder ofthis excerpt. The closing passage gives a clear description of Sympathiaactive in astrological magic, attributed to Utarid the Wise, which is to sayHermetic sources.

There aredifferences from those given in the Latin and Spanish editions, which con-form more closely to Western usage and have likely been adapted to doso. This note of caution aside, the principle is well illustrated and the in-clusion of the material suffrciently justified. The second row of planetarysymbols is from elsewhere in the text.The plan etary order employed here is very curious, it adjusts theChaldean order not to place Sun and Moon in most prominent position,but Sun and Venus. A female 6gure for the Sun is not surprising, beingapparently natural to some Sabean sects.In any case, Hecate, Medea andCirce are all relatives of Helios, and alternative male figures quickly follow.A crowned and throned figure suggests a solar Baal rather than theJovian.The resemblance of the 6gure to Helios is striking, it possesses all the at-tributes of his classical image. Although the mirror may be the remainsof a whip, its use in Mystery rituals is significant. Retaining the whip wehave a perfect Helios, and the image also adapts to an Abraxas by addinga rooster's head and snaky legs."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Venus image includes two typical images of a woman bearing an ap-ple, with variations. More complex images with a child probably rcpre-senting Eros, and Mars mentioned by name, obviously draw on classicalin..agery, So too the woman with apple reflects Aphrodite's triumph at theJudgement of Paris, the ancient precursor of all these survives in the bibli-cal Eve. The supposedly solar lion in the martial image reminds us thatMars was the later attribute of previously solar Nergal. one must alsobe careful in examining older syncrerism. Symbols are not necessarily ex-clusive; the martial lion can also equally represenr Jupiter or rhe Sun askingly figures. However, they are not all inclusive either. Not all synonymsof related figures are mutual; martial Nergal was also the Sun, but Apollo,while frequently associated with solar Helios and lunar Men, never be-came Mars. This is a timely reminder of the relations and distinctionsbetween gods and celestial bodies.Such images of star-daimons as rhar ofJupiter: a man with the face ofa lion and the feet of a bird, are plainly the inspiration for similar descrip-tions of demons in texts such as the Goetia. Similar images were attrib-uted to the decans, which were completely personified in ancient magic,frequently as demons. If such spirits are infernal, the term obviously doesnot apply in the assumed subterranean sense.283"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE FIGURES OF THE STONESRegarding engravings for seal rings of the seven planets:Engravings of tbe Sunr Concerning the engravings appropriate to the Sun; when one drawstalismans under the greater Luminary on a ringftone of ruby of a purered colour the pi&ure of a king, who sits on a throne, with a crown onhis head and the image of a raven before him and this 6gure under hisfeet, one conquers all kings.

Yet, while Western magic was christianised inthe medieval and Renaissance period, in order for modern Wesrern magicto properly interconnect with the African and New World systems, a re-examination of our pagan past is both necessary and unavoidable.

Despite its centrality to the inherited traditions ofmagic, many modern occultists neglect the art, and not always throughlack of interest.

In the second case, if rhe time before noon is greater rhan thesidereal time, add z4 hours to the Sidereal Time. you rhen turn rothe end of the book and look at the Tables of Houses for rhe placeyou wish to ser up the figure.

This is particularly true for loca-tions covered by the short Table of Houses in back of Raphael's Ephemeris;alarger book of Tables is also available from Raphael's which greatly ex-tends the range.It should be noted that the format of Raphael's Epbemerishas slightly changed since Crowley wrote.

The avoidance of modernelements is understandable within limits, but the neglect of Hellenisticastrology demonstrates the narrowness of such partiality. An historicalanalysis shows that certain elements of the Renaissance method wereheavily influenced by Arab innovations which were not necessarily im-provements on their Greek sources. The Arabic Parts are a major casein point, being an elaboration upon the Lots employed in the Hellenisticmethod.

An important writer among modern astrologicaltraditionalists is Robert ZoIler, whose research deserves major credit.On the other hand however his Losr Key to Prediction exemplifies thesetrends, dealing as it does with the Arabic parts in astrology. Importanttranslations of Guido Bonatti and other sources form a key part of thetext. Bonatti incidentally was a very important practitioner of astrologi-cal magic; he was also a thoroughly irascible personality as deserving of amovie biography as Aleister Crowley, if not more solReturning to Zol\\er's text however, therein we find the use of these socalled Arabic parts in commodiries speculation; involving formulae forplotting the future value of various crops. For example, in the case of len-tils: subtract the degree of Mars from that of Sarurn, add the result ro thedegree of the Ascendant, project the result from the Ascendant to 6ndthe position of the Part of Lentils; and form your judgemenr therefrom.After two dozen such examples there follows thirty-seven other Arabicparts, following Al-Biruni, for employment in judging horary figures. Theenormous proliferation of these abstract calculations in the Arab period isadequately demonstrated by these examples. The precedent in Hellenisticastrology has been elaborated to the point where the original idea is com-pletely swamped.The Greek formula were elegant and focussed; they were also muchless numerous, and deserve attention from modern astrologers and ma-gicians applying astrological methods. They involve important elementsof the philosophical and theoretical basis of Hellenistic magic, which themajority of Arabic parts clearly do not. Seven of these formula are pre-eminent: two of them represent the Sun and Moon, the others the fiveplanets of traditional astrology. The most important of these is that nowa-days known as the Part of Fortune; the Hellenistic astrologers referredto this as the Kleros Tyches or Lot of Tyche (Fortuna in Latin) whichis lunar in nature.

A fair amount of astronomical knowledge is required to followthe course of the lore of the stars. To enable the student to overcome thisobstacle to some extent we write this chapter. LJrsa Major and several oth-er non-zodiacal stars and constellations will appear in the course of thissection and I shall endeavour to amplify any obscure points as they occur.That Ursa Major is associated with the World centre is not surprising,as the Northern Height would represent such an association to any racedwelling in high places in Northern latitudes. The World Centre was noralways identified with Polaris, although some forms of the motif stronglysuggest a connection with the theme fromearly times. Ursa Major and theWorld Centre motif in mythology predate Ursa Minor's arrival at the Poleposition by many thousands of years. Polaris, the Pole Star, of the constel-lation Ursa Minor is a comparative newcomer to the Northern Height.3ooo years ecs when Sumerian and Egyptian cultures were already bothestablished the Pole Star was Thuban, the brightest star in the constella-tion Draco, the celesdal dragon that winds sinuously around both of thestellar Bears, Major and Minor.Astronomers call the phenomenon of changing Pole Stars the preces-sion of the equinoxes. The same phenomena causes the zodiacal signs at-tending the equinoxes to change evety zooo years. This is the explanationof the cycle of astrological ages, such as the Age of Pisces and the futureAge of Aquarius. Aries is traditionally the sign of the Spring equinox, butin fact precession caused Pisces to usurp this position hundreds of yearsago. About a third of the constellation Pisces has to move over the Vernalequinox point before the much-vaunted Age of Aquarius comes to pass.AN STAR-LOREM"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The legend of the dragon-slayer rcfers ro the change from Thuban toPolaris. Many dragon slayers are in fact named bear, as Beowulf = Bee-wolf = Bear, and Arthur = LJrsa = Bear. Interestingly, Arthur's surnamewas Pendragon meaning Dragons Head. Other dragon slayers are iden-tified with the constellation Orion, occasionally said to stand on rheDragons Head, although the constellation Hercules more usually receivesthis dubious honour. Hercules and Orion are major figures in stellar lore,identified with the consorts and co-regents of the Goddess.Orion in Egypt is seen as Osiris, and the constellation Lepus, belowhim, as his funerary boat. Draco in this case would be Apep. The originaldragon slayer was the Sumerian deity Marduk,later to become Adad andMelqart and so on. This slaying in fact asserrs the dignity of the deity, nolonger content to be a doomed and dying god. He becomes the undyingco-regent or even supreme God.A more important form of the boat of the Underworld is the constel-lation Argo that in conjunction with Sirius, Orion and Canis Major andMinor has attracted attention from various authors. But Ursa Major andMinor and their key role in stellar myth cycles have been curiously over-looked. Ursa Major's role in the dark cults of antiquity may be exemplifiedin the'witches' widdershins dance. This does nor seem to be explained bya conscious reversal of the direction of the Sun.It is more likely a continu-ation of the earlier practice emulating the anticlockwise direction of UrsaMajor.It is this constellation that marked out the cross-quarter days of thewitches' year - thus indicaring the position of the four major Sabbats.Theholy place of the witches and their antecedents was the northern quarrer,the place of the circumpolar constellarions Draco and Ursa Major.TheYezidis have their holy place in the North, practice widdershins cir-cumambulations and so on. The origins of such rites can only come froma culture practicing some form of asrronomy. The Sabeans derived theirknowledge from Chaldean - that is to say,late Babylonian sources, whichin turn stemmed from Sumeria. The Yezidis as a people (as opposed to asect for the name indicates race as well as religion) claim descent from theAssyrians, another nation which obtained much of its culture and beliefsfrom Sumeria.306"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The position of the Sabbats in the calender is curious.

Nowhere in biblical literature, apart from Revelations wherethe Dragon is not named, is Leviathan described as seven-headed. Butin Ugaritic tablets this identification is plainly made.

Capricorn was called the Gate of the Gods bywhich souls passed into Heaven.The myth cycle of the constellations in this part of the sky is briefly asfollows, drawing on Greek and Egyptian symbology although predatingthem both. The Underworld river is typified by the Milky Way, its celes-tial countetpart, intersected at two points namely Cancer and Capricornin the band of the Ecliptic, called the zodiac.
