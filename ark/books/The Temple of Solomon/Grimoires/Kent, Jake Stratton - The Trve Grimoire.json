Waite considered the Grimorium Verum one of the, 'specific and undisguised handbooks of Black Magic: and incorporated sections into his which has the distinction of being named in Aleister Crowley's autobiographical notes, its reading mark-ing the official commencement of his magical career. Original manuscripts of the Grimoire were unknown to these au-rhors, as they are to the present writer. There are many inaccuracies and omissions in the quite widely differing French and Italian printed versions and perhaps even more so in their English derivatives. Indeed, many of these were catchpenny affairs, exhibiting no care whatever in editing the various materials at their disposal. In consequence a great many important characters and sigils had been lost, substituted, re-versed or mislabelled. Idries Shah wrote in his OrierltalMagic of: ... the much-coveted Grin/orium Verum, [thatJ by means of it rhe sorcerer may prepare himself for the difljcult exercise of the Art, can make the various instruments which are essential to the difficult art of raising spirits, and can evoke and dismiss a large number of powerful beings.

A survey of the variants indicated tbat to even partially recover the core of a lost 'original' would require more than a collated edition of the printed versions as suggested by Shah; rather a critical reconstruc-tion was needed. This process of reconstruction has been, hitherto, an unsurmounted obstacle to the production of a definitive edition. Although writers such as Shah have claimed to synthesise de-ments of the primed Italian and French editions this Ius not really served a useful purpose. as often reproducing the faults of both as rec-tifying one by the other. So while his readers may have been led to believe that the Italian editions supply deficiencies in the French re-garding characters and sigils, in fact they are missing key elements and mislabel others which the French preserves in better order. In addition we find sometimes the French and Italian versions of a par-ticular sigil are reversed in relation to one another, or even that part of one sigil has become attached to another. Essentially, the problem of characters involves the following: A) The nature and appearance of the character to be worn by the op-eraror when commencing the process of the Grimoire. r shall call this the first character as it is the first to be mentioned and of the first im-portance in beginning the work.

Primarily this is because most have drawn from one source, being derived from a single French edi-tion without comparison with the Italian editions which makes the discrepancies more apparent. Nevertheless, it appears not to have been noticed that some spirits have been given sigils that are also at-tributed to another spirit in the same book! This discrepancy be-comes more glaring when variants are compared, but is detectable with close examination within each of them. In one influential French version we have an apparently random selection oHifteen sigils, most of them apparently from a set of eight-een spirits, two from a second set offifteen who otherwise have none.

This, taken with the use of his sigil and others as inscriptions on instruments, may point to the source of confusion among the figures. Of the confused sigils, al-most every case is to be found among the first eight spirits. Often also we find that the plates illustrating the symbols of the three chiefs in the French editions have additional characters underneath them that are not theirs but those of three of these eighteen spirits. Taken to-gether these facts suggest a misreading of a now lost plate of illustra-tions. ~ Figurefrom the French edition: the circularfigure is that ofLuc!fer, the central figure of the three below it is the sigil of Claunech, while the left hand figure represents Lucifer in Europe and that on tl)e right his dominion in Asia. 4"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"JiJe Importance of the True Grimoire CiJaracters of Bdzeuutl! tlnd A)1;arothfrom the Frenc/! edition, with misplaced sigils In:neath.

These three spirits are among the first eight, as are Bechaud, Frimost and Klepoth, whose symbols would have been given later on because of their relation to the knife and the wands. Another diffl-culty arises here, fl)r Klepoth has been allocated two different sigils in the various editions. I shall refer to these as the dancing and divin-ing sigils.

The preference in this reconstruction, if not necessarily in practice, is to follow the Italian version in this in-stance. This reading conforms to the hypothetical misreading of the lost pLIte. In the present writer's view this hypothesis partially or com-pletely explains the majority of mislabelled cases.

True Grimoire Despite these difficulties, it deserves saying that the apparent diffi-culty surrounding the two spirits from the second list, who are de-prived of sigils by the hypothesis of the broken plate and by comparative deduction, is resolved not by characters in the Italian version, but by its text. There is a collective conjuration in the hal ian of this entire group of spirits and various superiors, not given in the French. This indicates a different means of employment from those for whom characters are given. The suggested identification of two names, in an obscure parr of the Preamble of the Grimorium Verum, with two superiors among these spirits surmounts a major obstacle to reconstructing the original modus operandi in its entirety. Some-thing along these lines may be the clarifying material in the Italian which Shah referred to in The Secret Lore of Magic. In that book also he refers to the Grimorium Verum as: ... one of the most interesting of magical rituals which include the famous grimoires or black books of the sorcerers. It is, in fact. nothing less than a magician's handbook. containing in small compass the entire rites of preparation, identification of spirits, [and the process of] conjuration. In this assessment he is undoubtedly correct, and this compact com-pleteness underlines its imporrance both to magicians and to students of magic. Despite its small size it touches on many matters which other more frequently cited grimoircs avoid. For whatever reason, by omit-ting Qabalistic and Hermctic systems that are of more recent vintage than the roots of Goetic practice, while integrating and even high-lighting negative Christian interpretation of forbidden magic. it re-rains what is useful from-or compatible with themes cenrral co Goetic tradirions. -n1e Grimoire deals with significant thcmes that other, often larger, texts have lost, omitted or obscured.

The more gruesome as-pects of its preparation in traditional sources so blinded and intimidated previous commentators on the grimoires that they missed a fair sized baby when throwing out the gory bathwater. Whatever other value it may possess. the work of the editors of the grimoires in the 19th century occult revival is wholly inadet1uate in terms of eluci-dation. In particular. as an examination of these cryptic documents shows, there was a central role for this prepared parchment and its in-tended use that was almost entirely missed by Waite. Mathers and Crowley. Indeed. Goetic magic as a whole was largely underestimated and superficially delineated by all these authors. From one perspective the most relevant exponent of the magical revival when considering the grimoires is Austin Osman Spare.

Now considering the many links between the acts of writing and of performing magic exemplified by such words as spell, the fact that grimoire means grammar and that the gods of magic in many cul-tures are also the gods of writing one might have expected them to have looked deeper, bur since they didn't we must now do so together. The later grimoires, such as the Gralld GrinlOire, the Red Dragon &c. are in many ways corrupt and reduced redactions of such works as the Key C!f Solomon. bur due perhaps ro their closer proximity to our times some illuminating insights into obscure matters in the older texts can be gleaned from them. They are, so to speak, the closest stepping stone to the riverbank. and careful use of them offers a useful first step to understanding older themes. T() illustrate, the key docu-ment in these later texts is undoubtedly the Diabolical Pact, which in this context is essentially the source of the magician's power and a statement of his magical intentions. This is, despite the gross simpli-fications inherent in these texts, a major clue to the significance of the parchment and its inscription in earlier texts. The implication is that prepared document describes the powers and intentions of the magician; in Verum this is exemplified by the sigils of the spirits writ-ten upon the pact, which arc also used as inscriptions on magical weapons and in spells, which are the agents of those powers and of realising those intentions. In other words, the magician's intent, all the instruments and many of the critical operations undertaken, are symbolically stated in a cen-tral document whose preparation is thus the principal and central act of the entire work. Once understood this role is very apparent, though manifested in variant forms, in the majority of Solomonic and related texts. For example, in Vcrum the operator must first make all the weapons and have them on the altar at the time of preparing the parchment. The main of the inscription in this case is a large and elaborate sigil. This is the signature of an intermediary spirit who gives access to all the others, akin in a real sense to the Holy Guardian Angel in the Abramdin system; in addition, the conjurations and sigils 12"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Goctia alld Sigils of the spirits whose presence is specifically required in the operations immediately following arc also drawn on the parchment. \"I11is docu-ment may be used only once, though several agencies may be conjured at a time. Subsequent operations, and the summoning of other entities from the Vert/In hierarchy, require the manufacture of another such document. Although it is likely that the magician using this grimoire might need parchment or paper for other subsidiary purposes there is no doubt that such a document as this is the reason for the central role given such materials throughout the grimoire genre. Of unique importance in the case of Vcrum, the inscriptions on several of the magical tools and the characters drawn in several of the minor operations are in fact the sigils of demons from its hierarchy. All the various actions and intentions involved in Vcruln style sorcery are directly rdated to a series of sigils. Or, to put it another way, every-thing the operator desires and the operations necessary to achieve it can be reduced to a set of magical characters that can subsequently be employed in attaining those ends. 111is is why thc magical parchmcnt is central to evocation, and why it is the most powerful symbol of the magicians will and authority.

In other words, where Verum performs its magic through the sigils of the spirits, Abramclitl does the same with magic squares associated with them. Whatever the precise relation of their two approaches, this is not the only linkage of Verult! with Abmmelin, nor even the most important. 1he foremost parallel between Abmmclin and \\lcmm is the central role of an inter-mediary spirit to contact the others; the Holy Guardian Angel in Abramdin, the spirit Scidin in the Grimoire. \\Vhile Sci din and the Holy Guardian Angel are distinct in nature their central intermediary role is not found in any other major grimoire. Interconnection of Vmm: with one or other text of Abramelil: is also found regarding el-ements of the Character of Seirlin, the name of the spirit Aglasis, and the names of several of the chief spirits. While most recent interest in Abramelin has been focussed on a translation of German manuscripts, certain details unique to the French text are particularly relevant to the study of Veruln and Goetic magic. It is true that many magic squares from the German have been badly handled in the French. What is less well appreciated is that the French possesses some squares unique to itself. Among these are the squares of Uriel and Adam that completely distinguish the French ritual equipment and procedure from the German, and are powerfully reminiscent of the Divination l1Y tile Word of Uriel in the Supernatuml Secrets ~r Verum. Seven other squares are formed from the names of chiefs of the spirits, of which only one originates in the German, also there is in the French a second square of UrieL The adaptation of Ahramelin in the French 15"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"11)c True Gnmoire manuscript undoubtedly involved elements of a system of Goetic magic closely allied to Verum. The relationship of Verum with Abramelill is important, but there are significant relations with other texts. In my estimation, the nu-merous textual correlations of Verum with the MSS of the Key of Solomon indicate that Vemm connects with an early stage in the de-velopment of the latter. 111e Operator of this system may find it useful to compare the various stages with their equivalents in the Key of Solomon. Many of the ritual tools and their preparatory rituals have equivalents in the Key, and aspects of its procedure may also be used to supplement the Verum process. For example, as well as the two in-scriptions for the Liming Pot given in Verum, a completely different set of characters is given in the Key. Since the parchment has to be quite large, when making the pot that accommodates it is no trouble to incorporate these in addition to the Vrrum characters. In addition, should we be using clay or other materials to make our pot or other required item, there are procedures in the Key with which to facilitate the Verum process. In considering the relationships of the various grimoires it is perhaps more useful not to consider the Key of Solomon as a single book, but as the titular archetype of a genre; many books sharing one title. Some manuscripts of the Key of Solomon in fact contain completely distinct ritual systems. Mathers' supposed master edition succeeds by omission rather than inclusion. Where he distinguishes material from our Grimoire and the Key itself he is not to be entirely trusted. Verum represents a stage in the de-velopment of the archetypal Key, and evil spirits aside, is as deserving of our attention as Mathers' somewhat rigidly defined Key. Clavicules du Roi Salomon -Livre Troisieme: Lansdowne MS 1202 The first two books of this version of the Key of Solomon, which is lodged in the British Library, were consulted by Mathers in preparing his edition of the Key of Solomon. He noted in his introduction that the third part of the work contained sigils from the Grimorium Verum, and he thus omitted it. The manuscript is some twenty years 16"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"71)(; Context of the Grimoirc older than the printed versions ofVemm, although based on internal evidence it is not the original text. In any case, l'vlathers was of the opinion that anything roo strongly suggesting 'black magic' was nor a real pare of rhe Key, and some of his opinions and editorial decisions in this respect are most certainly mistaken, While it is possible that the book represents a compilation of Verum and the Key it is more likely to represent evidence of their common evolution. The impor-tance of this third part lays in twO principal departments. Firstly, it supplies the first character which is either erroneously substituted or simply omitted in published editions of the Grimorium Verum. 111i5 character plays a substantial role in the process by which the initial pact is formed; in this and other ways the Third Book of the Key is useful and important in the task of reconstructing the lost original. Secondly, by reducing the paraphernalia of evocation to a blood-stone and a single wand it shows itself a more serious relative of the Grand Grimoire, which employs a similar pair of implements. 111is suggests that at least some of the materials of the Gralld Grimoire were collated from or inspired by serious sources. Also among the material Mathers omitted is a dose relation of the main Verum hier-archy. Together these details suggest a real familial relationship be-tween these black books, which, for some purposes at least, are better considered together than apart. Given its close relationship with Verum I have employed this manuscript in my reconstruction. The Steganogruphia ll1is work of the Abbot T rithemius, a friend and magical mentor of Agrippa, influenced numerous grimoires which incorporated various elements from it. In the case ofVerum this involves the conjurations of the Ibree Chiefs and of Inferior Spirits. It is possible that these elements are deliberate substitutions for conjurations from a lost orig-inal, and were perhaps not actually meant to be used by those in the know.

In private correspondence Joseph Peterson suggested to me that 'Empto: derives from a COI1-traction of a Latin term meaning apprentice; this is consistent with elements of the text that make it dear that the author claims to be not Solomon himself but his srudent in magic. Among the significant differences between \\Veyer's text and the Goetia ~f Solomon the King is the absence from the latter of the spirit Pruslas or Busas, who is present in the Gnmd Grimoirc. This spirit is also missing in Reginald Scot's Dl5COl'crie 0/ Witchcraft which relies on an incomplete (and highly imperfect) English translation of \\Veycr's text. It has been sug-gested that Scot's corrupt source may also have provided material for the GOl'tia. It is equally, if not more possible, that the Goetia derives its hierarchy directly from Scot, just as Shakespeare obtained his ref-erences from the same hierarchy, At the same time, it is certain that the well known text of the Goetia currently available did not provide material for Verum or the Grand Grimoire. It is significant roo that Colin Planey's Illfcrnal Dictionary (first edition ISIS) with Louis Breton's hmous and often reproduced illustrations of demons, draws direcdy on Weyer. 'TIl is too is demonstrated by the inclusion ofPrus-las as well as giving Weyer as a reference. It is also dear that he drew on both Ventm and HOlloriu5 (Lucifer's rule of Europe and Asia is cited, along with other details that make this certain). So although Breton's illustrations often accompany recent editions of the Goeti .. it is apparent that they represent a much wider tradition. Interestingly De Planey refers in passing to 'English traditions', and it is to sllch traditions that the Goaid actually belongs, as indicated by all manu-scripts of the book being in English, rather than French or Latin. 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The True Grimoire TIJe Grimoire of Pope Honorius Also relevant to studies of Verum is the Grimoire of Pope Honorius. The difficulties with printed editions of the grimoires mentioned ear-lier become acute with this grimoire. Relations between Honorius and Verum are complex, though Verum is demonstrably the older, and a primary source for the compiler of the Honorius grimoire. Seven spirits from the Verum hierarchy are found in editions of the Honorius grimoire, in every case there is some confusion of sigils. 111e later Ital-ian editions of Verum seem to have absorbed this material back from Honorius because of this connection with Verum spirits. Several Verum spells also find their way into some editions of Honorius; though always without the correct symbols (attempts to rectify poor editions of Verum via Honorius add to rather than diminish confu-sion). Various editions of Honorius include illustrations from other Goetic texts, chiefly True Black Magic, without regard for accuracy or even honesty. Symbols are inserted haphazardly into one from the other.

The double irony is that the symbol employed in this de-ception has been lifted from an earlier edition of the Grimoire of Honorius itself!

Interestingly, some Spanish versions of the Book oJSaim Cypnml arc said to include spirit hierarchies taken from \\'crum. It is also significant that the Book of Saint Cypri<m is a standard feature of Brazilian Umbanda, which may have assisted the diflUsion of spirits from Verum within that tradition. In closing this section of our imroducrory remarks it as well to say a few words about the probable date and origin of the Grimoire. Un-derstanding the relationship between Vcrum and Abmmelin may cast additional light on this question in future. At present my research has led me to the conclusion that the original much more complete text was very likely French, for a variety of reasons, prominent among them the French tirles for the four directions integral to the sigil of Scirlin. This character is absolutely essential to the performance of the rite in its emirety. It is omitted in the Italian editions, which bear other signs ofbowdlerisation, despite supplying much useful additional informa-tion towards this reconstruction. As regards date two factors are importam, for although the primed editions ofVaum used by \\Vaite, Shah et al are 19'1, century, there are strong indicators of considerably greater antiquity for the original. For example, the Grimoire oJ Honoriu5 has early editions, and several of the spirits from Veruln are to be found in that grimoire. It is apparent, as accepted by several previous authors, that HOlloriu5 borrows from both Verum and True Black j\\fagic.There are various reasons for this agreement, but it is shown most obviously by the more consistent han-dling of the material in the latter two texts. Obviously Verum has to be extant prior to the publication of H01loriu5 for this to happen. Sim-ilarly, as Verum makes mention of the Americas in a structurally im-portant part of the text, it has to post date the discovery and naming of the New World, There is a historical source by which we can give a latest possible date to one of the spirits appearing in both Verum and Honoriu5 who is not known from other sources, Oddly enough, this source has been mentioned in numerous modern works, without this identity being drawn.

The survival of this ritual shows clear signs of continuity from remote antiquity. The route by which this procedure reached European magicians is presendy ob-scure. It may have survived in some form from Roman times, or have been rediscovered through some oriental contact, or perhaps most likely from Byzantium. That it was adapted to a Solomonic format is not surprising, especially given the fact that Solomon was already a famous magician in the Papyri, besides being a suitable cover name for magicians of Christian Europe. What is surprising is that so much of its ancient form should have survived alongside these adaptations. The method involves what is known to modern occultists as skry-ing; inducing a series of visions by gazing at a reflective surface, flame or lamp. The variants of the technique include a bowl of water, a pool of ink on the hand, and so on. Regardless of these minor differences the resemblances remain plain. There are many examples of this method encountered in the Mag-ical Papyri (the Greek and particularly the Demotic), and persisting in the East until modern times. In the majority of them there is a strik-ingly similar series of events portrayed in the spirit visions. First a sin-gle spirit is seen, in many of the demotic versions he takes the form of Anubis. -This spirit is asked to bring in a group of other entities, a'com-pany of the gods; and is then told to provide these with a feast. When they have eaten the spirit is asked to find out which of them will pro-vide answers to the magician's questions.

From these visions were composed a hundred and fifty verses that foretold all the events of the wars ofMithridates with the Romans, 1111' trans-!ation of the boy's visions into verses is typical of Greek mantic meth-ods, and reflects the 11ellenic culture of much of Asia Minor at the time. Agrippa's account closely resembles that of Apulieus, whose de-scription varies in some minor derails: ... when the inhabitants ofTralles were making inquiries by a magical process in regard to the issue of the Mithridatic War, a boy, who was gazing upon the reflection of a statue of Mer-cury in the water, uttered a prophecy of the future in a hun-dred and sixty metrical lines. If the perceived image was a reflection! as this translation takes it to be, the process involves a magical linking with the god. A similar process was at work when the Delphic Pythoness chewed laurel 28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Art Armadcl leaves. Contrary to popular opinion this would have no narcotic ef-fect, the intention being a sympathetic linkage with Apollo whose plant this is. Tralles incidentally was a city of Lydia, at no great dis-tance from Ephesus. It is very probable that this form of divination was among the magical arts for which Ephesus was renowned in New Testament times. Various means were employed to enhance this technique in all its forms, such as incense of various kinds, occasionally including veg-etable drugs. Sometimes lists of various burnt offerings are also rec-ommended, each for a difFerent purpose, such as to bring in a particular kind of spirit, specific to the kind vision sought. Others were to hasten the process, or to accompany the dismissal of the spir-its and so on. Below are examples of such from PDM XIV. 80-89 which is closely related to the Demotic ritual that follows later.

If you wish to them all depart. you put ape's dung on the brazier. then they all depart to their place. and you utter their spell of dismissal also. If you wish to bring in a thief. you put crocus powder with alum on the brazier. TIle making of offerings also accounts for the importance of the in-cense burner in these operations. Selection of appropriate incenses for other purposes within the rite might also involve the association of particular planes and substances with particular gods or religious rites. Note the use of an amulet of Nephthys among these prescrip-tions. when the purpose is a necromantic rite.

There arc also very strong links between ancient Hydromancy and the practice of Necromancy. When spring water is used it almost invariably indicates this connec-tion is in force. In addition, a magical plant was occasionally added to the water. Among these must be counted the narcissus. 111is plant is associated with a Greek myth more likely to have concerned 11ydromancy orig-inally than the moralising subject to which it is usually turned. Many details of the myth have parallels in H ydromantic practice, and it is likely the myth originates in a sect employing this technique. 111e Un-derworld associations of the plant are extensive, being used in funeral wreaths among Greeks and Egyptians, and attributed to Hades, Persephone and Demeter alike. It also appears among the magical plants of the Eighth Book of Moses in the Magical Papyri. Another reinforcing method involved adding various magical stones to the water in the bowL particularly bright ones, which heighten the brightness of the light reflected. Some of these stones also had magical markings: these could be characters of appropriate spirits or talismans with a divinatory purpose. Hxmatite, a stone pos-sessing great importance in the lore of the more openly goetic gri-moires, was among these stones. Others were stones of a watery nature, such as beryl. Diamonds, on account of their brightness, were also used. lhree examples of the Armadel method follow. one from the De-motic Papyri, one from the Grxco-Egyptian Papyri, and another from 19th century Egypt.

The magician then again interrupted his muttering to ask the boy if he knew what a beyrak (or flag) was; and being answered, Y n, desired him to say, Bring a _fiag. The boy did so and soon said, He has hottght afiag. What colour is it? asked the magician; the boy replied, Red. He was told to call for another flag, which he did; and soon after he said that he saw another brought and that it was black. In like manner he was told to call for a third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh, which he described as being successively brought before him, specifying their colours, as white, green, black, red and blue. The magician then asked him (as he did also each time a new flag was described as being brought), How mOllY _fiags have you now before you? Seven, answered the boy.

Mr. Lane then proceeded to relate how sundry persons whom he named were called for by the boy, and described as appearing in the magic mirror, the descriptions given being in some cases astonishingly appropriate. In line with the rites from the Papyri, tbe magician was able to call up the images of any person living or dead. Mr. Lane asked him to bring in Lord Nelson and Shakespeare among others. It is very un-likely that the boy, or even the magician, had heard of or seen images of these people. However, Nelson was described as wearing a dark blue (literally black) European suit and as having lost an arm.

Mr. Lane asked the magician if the images were seen as in normal vi-sion or as in a mirror, the magician answered as in a mirror. Shake-speare was also described accurately, and so on. Goodwin's comment continues: ... the preliminary objects seen, a description of which the ma-gician elicits from the boy by leading questions. are evidently ancient and traditionaL and their general resemblance to the appearances mentioned in our :\\.1S. is obvious. The sultan and his suite have been substituted for the divinity borne on his throne by four men; the slaughtering of the red bull represents a sacrifice symbolised by the thumiaterion or censer; possibly the man sweeping the ground may be derived from a neokoro3 or temple-sweeper, a very likely personage to have appeared as a precursor to the procession of the god. although not actually mentioned in our MS. Regarding the tirle neokoros mentioned by Griffith, this is a very com-mon Greek expression, and indicates a person dedicated to the service of a deity. The term also frequently appears on Greek imperial medals and signified the devotion of the city represented to the service of a particular deity, as Diana at Ephesus and so on. In this ritual the fig-ure. identified by Griffith as a neokoros. takes the same role of inter-mediary as Anubis in the Demotic equivalent. Goodwin goes on to say that, 'the flags recall the sacred banners used in Egyptian ceremo-nials'. It is noteworthy that the flag was the hieroglyph for god in An-cient Egypt; the seven banners of the vision seem to represent a forgotten company of the gods from the older form of the rite. Ban-ners also form a part of the diagram accompanying a rite of the same nature in the later grimoires.

Mathers' comments in bvour of the direct vision approach, saying that: ... for my part I cannot understand the imperative necessity of the employment of a child in the angelic evocation, if the op-erator be pure in mind, and has devell)ped the clairvoyant fac-ulty which is latent in every human being. Evocations practiced by Mathers and his fellow initiates involved ei-ther direct vision, or a fellow magician taking the role of seer. 1his approach is nor merely preferable, but equally tradirional. In Eliza-bethan times there is the famous precedent in the seer Edward Kelley working with the magician John Dee, In ancient times the virginity and youth of a set~r was often more symbolic than actual. -Ihe prophetess at Delphi was a mature woman made virgin for magical purposes by wearing a bridal dress and virgin wreath. Mathers also mentions the employment of a child seer in the cel-ebrated evocation involving Benvenuto Cellini. More central to Math-ers' remarks is the 18'11 century magician Cagliostro: The well-known Joseph Balsamo, Count Cagliostro. is said to have been born at Palermo in 1743. On his trial at Rome in 1790, and at Zurich in 1791, he was accused of'having prac-tised all kinds of impositions; of gold making, and of possess-ing the secret of prolonging life; of teaching Cabalistic arts; of summoning and exorcising spirits; of having actually foretold future things especially in small and secret assemblies, and chiefly by means of a little boy whom he took aside with him into a separate room, in order to fit him for divining. With regard to the manner in which he employed tbis child clairvoyant, the documents of the trial give the following in-formation: This child had to kneel before a small table. on 42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Art Armadcl which a vessel of water and some lighted candles were placed. He then instructed the boy to look into the vessel of water, and so commenced his conjurations; he next laid his hand on the head of the child, and in this position addressed a prayer to God for a successful issue of the experiment. 1he child now became clairvoyant, and said at first that he saw something white; then that he saw visions, an angel, &c. Resemblances to the Arab form are apparent throughout. and Math-ers clearly relates both to Abr<Jmeiin. However, the use of a vessel of water and candles are important details for other reasons, as will be-come clear. Again the documents say, 'That he worked through the usual ceremonies, and that all was wonderfully corroborated through the appearance of the angel'. Mathers further notes that: Cagliostro is also said at Milan to have availed himself of the services of an orphan maiden of marriageable age as clairvoy-ant. Other sources specify that the rites in Milan involved a phial of water and two torches: It will be remarked that this modus operandi differs strongly from that employed by the mesmerists and hypnotists of today with their clairvoyants. For here the whole force of the opera-ror was concentrated on a magical ritual of evocation, the hand being merely laid on the child's head to form a link; and it in no way appears that the child was reduced to the miserable condition of automatic trance now practised, and which a re-ally advanced occultist would be the first to condemn, as know-ing its dangers. On the other hand, there seems to be a distinct 43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The True Grimoire similarity between Cagliostro's method, and the system of ori-ental divination called the Mendal, to which I have previously referred. TIle correctness of his identification of Cagliosrro' s method with the Mendal is apparent from comparison with the rituals given earlier. It is further corroborated by details he omits. These operations, and the angel encountered in them, gave access to seven pure spirits, and the ritual described bears a close resemblance to one found in various contemporary grimoires, of these that occurring in the Grimorium Ventm and known as Divination by the Word of Uriel is particularly close to Cagliostro's method. The Divil/(Ition by the Word of Uriel is very closely related to The Operation of Urid Seraphim. The latter appears in the seventeenth century Grimoire oClla Cabale by Armadel, (MS 2494 Bibliotheque de l' Arsenal. see illustration opposite). A slightly different version of the illustration accompanying this rite appears in Mathers' translation of the Grimaire of Armadel (from Bibliorheque de l'ArsenaL Sc. Et A. No. 88), though strangely unaccompanied by any mention of the rit-ual. TI1c Armadel form does not employ a child seer, just as in the pa-pyri where we find variants for direct vision by the magician alone. There are also some differences in wording from the Divimltion ap-pearing in the GrimoriurI1 Verum as may be seen below: Urid Seraphim, potesta 10, Zati, Zata, Abbati, Abbata, Agla, Cailo, Cai/a, I pray thef and conjure thee in tlJe name of the Living God and by Him, thy master alld mine; by all the might of the Holy Trinity; by the virginity of the Holy \\/irgill; by the four sacred words wtJich the great Aghl said with His OWIl mouth to lvIoses, 10, 2Mi, Zata.

The role of Uriel as intermediary, corresponding to Anubis in the Papyri, has been largely lost in the text of the rite, due probably to uninformed adaptations. It is nevertheless apparent from the word Armadel in the title of the grimoire, from the illustration, and the cor-respondence of various features of the rite with its predecessors. The wide influence of this manner of working can be seen in the career of the Elizabethan magician] ohn Dee, referred to above. He operated a Mendal system known as the Heptarcilia Mystica in which his seer was Edward Kelley. In this adaptation the seven pure spirits become the lords of the seven days of the week, accompanied by their ministers. Dee's method resembles the Operation of Uriel Serapilim in another important respect. Uriel is frequently encountered in Dees magical diary, recording Angelic conversations resulting from these rituals. Dees system is the best known application of the Armadel method in modern occultism of the English speaking world. The Abramelin system as made known by Mathers is almost as famous. However nei-ther of these systems originated the method, which is a survival from remote times to which the grimoire tradition is the natural heir. While terms, names and titles related to Armadel are frequent in the grimoire literature, particular grimoires best exemplify the actual method. Among these the True Grimoire is certainly prominent, and not only for its inclusion of the Divination by tile Word of Uric/. Although the Olympic spirits prominent in related grimoires could easily replace the Seven Angels of the Divination technique, his-torical examples show that the Armadel method was never restricted to spirits of the seven planets or days of the week. The hierarchy of Vcrum is thus equally appropriate to the method of Arl11adel. Indeed the three chiefs and their deputies, nine in all, are equal in number to some companies of the gods prominent in Grxco-Egyptian magic of this type. On the other hand the demons of the seven days of the week and the intermediary spirit of the Verum system could as readily be employed in an adaptation of the Divination. 46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"11Je Art Arrnadel While the Divination is certainly a clear cut example of the method, and various Vert/Ill processes could readily be adapted to the Armadel approach, it appears that the main system of Verulll is an extended example of the same approach.

Further. there are clearly two conjuring processes interweaved in the text of Vemm. One of these is the straightforward approach, standing in a circle with rit-ual equipment, making conjurations and speaking to spirits. Besides this however is another method. where sigils are drawn and invoca-tions are simply written and then recited. This method clearly re-quires the magician to be seated, and the likelihood is that this involved the Armadel approach. most likely by direct vision of the magician acting alone. 47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THETRVE GRIMOIRE OR lbe most approved Keys of Solomon the Hebrew Rabbin, wherein the most hidden secrets, both natural and supernaturaL are immediately exhibited, bur it is necessary that the demons should be contented on their part.

The actual meaning of the title is that the Grimoire is the authentic Key or Clavicle of Solomon. The later French and Italian versions bear the name True Key(s) of Solomon, and I9'h century authors frequently cite Verum when speaking of The Key ~f Solomon, plainly considering the one to be identical with the other. THE FIRST PART The blood of a sea turtle: At first glance it seems possible a turtle-dove was originally intended. However, both the French and Italian editions of a tortoise of the sea, while English editions alone replace this with sea-turtle. Not only is this a tautology in English, as turtles are by definition marine creamres, but from I678 the English expression'sea-turtle has referred to a sea bird known as the Black Guillemot! In the French language 'rorroise of the water' means turrle and 'tortoise of the land' means tor-toise. Italian on the other hand has separate words for these two crea-tures, as does English. This is another indication of a French text preceding the Italian. (It is interesting to note that the offerings made in Santeria to the Orisha Eleggua known as Exu in Brazil include turtle. This offering specifically requires an experienced Santero or a Babalawo). The tortoise is also sacred to Hermes. II)is character si)ould 1,(, made: The character given, and the variant that follows it, are taken from Lib Trolsieme and the Grimoirc of Armadel.

Joseph Peterson has shown the Sci din character to have orig-inated in a procedure for consecrating magical rings. It would also be quite impractical to engrave the large and complex Scirlin figure ona ruby. However, while these two figures Jxe undoubtedly appropriate as substitutions in this part of the text, JS regards the Seirlin figure that follows later, I do not consider these substitutions appropriate, regardless of its origins. The first character and the character of Seidin plainly serve differenr roles. making the approach given the simplest and most consistent with Verulll texts. The apparent com-plexities of the Scirlin character's origins arc not beyond resolving. The ring-consecration idea could be extended w the pendant bearing the first character. suggesting it be placed upon the Scirlin figure when commencing the conjurations. 011 <Ill emerald or ruby: Emerald usually corresponds to Venus, ruby to the Sun. Arnhldd Libel' Troisieme adds another solar stone, heliotrope, which is also the stone llsed in forming a pact in the Grand Grimoirc. Heliotrope, or bloodstone, has a distinguished occult history that may be significant here. The Book of Secrets attributed to Albertus Magnus says, 'the necromancers call it Gemma Babylonica'. fiis necromancers are in identical with the Magi. or Babylonian priest magicians men-tioned by Pliny on the subject of the same stone. J n his account the magicians claimed that the stone heliotrope combined with the plant ofthe same name conferred invisibility. In shamanic terms invisibility is the power to move unimpeded in the world of spirits.

The early Christian theologian, Origen, who lived in Egypt 185 to 254 AD, speaks of the use of divination and charms as auto-matically involving pacts with demons, in which he is followed by St. Thomas Aquinas in the Middle Ages.

Given the early period at which menrion is made of both the hand and oftreas· ure hunts, and the strong t()lkloric ,lssociations, it is not unlikely that magical treasure hunting involved dim memories of subterranean journeys to the underworld, as an initiation or a commemoration of a famous mythical exploit.

Summarising the matter according to the Comte: Elementals are, in the main, high minded and willing allies of the 'Sages', although some among the subterranean Earth spirits are prone to influence from the infernal regions. They are identical with the former nature spirits of Pagan religion, some of whom (we might think of Astarte) were then understood as deities, and rhe voices of the Orades.

Each ofthese orders has dominion over the workings of the elemenr for which the order is named, and the demons of each order possess qualities and powers which are in harmony with the element ruled.

THE NATURE OF DfEMONES There are three chapters in Agrippa's Three Rooks ofOcw/t PI)iiosophy (Book III, Caps XVI, XVfl and XVIII) that have considerable bearing on the categories of spirits in the Goetic grimoires. His main sources for this material are the Neoplatonists, the Cabalists. and Christian theologians. Examining these chapters carefully shows these three sources disagree on several particulars -there are grey areas or cracks that many entire categories of spirits fall into, Firstly. examine the category of Intelligences described in XVI which subdivides into three levels: the first tWO are 5t~per-cele5tial and ce/esti<1/' and the third that which is below, which I shall take the liberty of caUing material. This third category is extremely wide, and includes spirits of every astrological and elemental category. and a huge amount of nature spirits and various others (including some spirits of the dead). Q.t:ite separate from these we find the lower demons. It is these and these alone that are both earth-bound and evil according to the Platonic or Neoplatonic systems. T'here is no good reason to identify the majority of spirits in the grimoires with these, and many good reasons not to. Cap XVII, TI,t' Orin/OilS o{ Theologialls, begins with a 'But', indi-caring that differences of opinion exist between them and the sources of Cap XVI. SO it is that here we find the material level has been allo-cated to a lesser order of angels, and the old nature spirits &c. have been all but entirely supplanted. Among the many orders previously described as Material Intelligences are certainly some that are de-monised in later theology, as well as some that already had dubious qualities in the older systems. The Material Intelligences included certain spirits of the dead, some of good men, some not so, as well as nature spirits too pagan to be accommodated in Christian systems, though some are substituted for by lesser Angels. A very few dead spirits might still squeeze into relevant theological categories as Saints (a lower Angelic Order) but most would be entirely omitted from present consideration. Cap XVII, dealing specifically with Evil spirits alone (mainly by theological reck-J41"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"]1)f True Grimoire oning) shows a trace more agreement between the various sources. Here we certainly find Infernal spirits, and spirits of the dead (obvi-ously not including Saints or those who could have been formerly cat-egorised as Material Intelligences due to some quality that lifted them above the common sort). Among these no doubt are to be counted spirits of the dead of a deLidedly inferior and unpleasant type. We find also plain references in Cap XVII to the Aerial demons. Snch referenLes to Aerial spirits are very common in much of the dc-monologicalliterature. I am using Agrippa here primarily as an au-thorative example. 'fhese are neither infernal nor earth bound, even allowing for the theologians including them wholesale among evil spirits. They are certainly material in the spe,:ific sense used here. In my opinion many of the Goetic spirits we commonly encounter in the grimoires, and such as arc imagined in the cultural era that pro-duced them, belong to this Aerial category. There are also references in this third chapter to so-called evil spir-its known as false gods. and this must be balanced by acknowledging that Christian theologians demonised many deities of the pagan world. Needless to say that was a world that would have had quite different opinions. It will also be readily seen that the third order of pure Intelligences overlaps considerably with categories of spirits reckoned impure or devilish by the theologians. A very obvious ex-ample is that of satyrs, reckoned among Material Intelligences in one schema, but among devils in theological sources XVI and XVII re-spectively). These hairy and horned crearures obviously have some bearing on the image of Christian devils, as indeed does Pan, who no Neoplatonist would call a devil (reckoning him a type of the All by Greek etymology). It is plain from this that demons and evil spirits and those who have been described as such either erroneously or through prejudice are - by a careful and impartial reading of the sources not at all re-stricted to earth bound or infernal types. ~any, perhaps the majority, of the demons in the grimoires are from the grey areas in the third order of Intelligences.

THE UNHOLY TRINITY The three chief spirits are frequently named in grimoires, and in Verul1l and others constitute a kind of Infernal Trinity analogous to the Holy Trinity of Christian theology. In the Grand Grimoire and atleast by implication in the Grimorium Verum they rule over pairings among the six next spirits, sometimes referred to as subordinates who in turn have power over specific groups within the next eighteen who are sometimes referred to as inferiors.

It is a fact that some of the Gnostic scriptures were influenced by the earliest magical books attributed to Moses and Solomon, such as The ArclJangelikr (~f Moses, wherein spirit hierarchies were enumerated, and themes found in the later grimoires -such as the brazen vessel( s) of Solomon - also make an appearance. As wild as it may seem to connect a second cen-tury Gnostic entity with a demon from the grimoires, some strange names and words in magical texts have longer histories. Whatever the case, Nebiros is among the names of chiefs who appear in various sources. In Verum his role is extensive, since he is ruler of ten out of fifteen of the second set of spirits, as well as sharing the rulership of some among the first eighteen. It is important to note that his sound alike spirit is also known as Cerberus, originally the three headed guard dog of the Classical Underworld. In the Hellenistic period Cer-berus is frequently identified with the Egyptian god Anubis.

His autlJority is as that of the Emperor, which is to say that Scirlin's intermediary role avoids the necessity of the ma-gician continually disturbing the chief of all spirits.

Hap is the God of the Nile and was an extremely popular god among Egyptians of all classes with a great many household shrines, and a hundred or more at landing stages along the Nile. The Nile represented also the Celes-tial Waters or World Ocean in which all existence is afloat, and upon which the stability of all things depends. His name also resembles the Egyptian Qebh, cool :lnd refreshing water. Elelogap then translates as 'Praise be King of the \\Vaters' or' Praise the Cool Refreshing \\Vater; or perhaps most simply 'Holy Water: Hep or Hapi is always repre-sented as a man, bur his breasts are those of a woman, indicating the powers of fertility and nourishment of the god. The two kingdoms of Egypt, North and South each had a form of Hapy, that of the South being Hap-Reset, and of the North being called Hap-Meht. It is a possibility that the androgynous image of Baphomet was partly in-spired by Hapi of the North. The apparent absence of a sigil for Elelogap is problematic. Espe-ciallyas both Verum and Armadcl (which calls him Eliogaphatel) refer to it as if it was an integral part of the text they were consulting. One possible solution is in the idea that the role ofClaunech underwent a process of degradation in the published texts, in the interests of treas-ure hunting. This process might be more advanced in the Italian edi-tion where all mention of Scirlin so vital to the true conception of the Grimoire -has disappeared and his invocation been given to Claunech. This may parallel the later development of Lucifuge Rofocale. In the Gr,1Ild Grimoire he supplants T;lrchimache in the hi-erarchy, and has Claunech's treasure hunting power emphasised in higher degree. This could well be the climax of the same degradation process. Following this line of thought, suppose the degradation of Claunech was at the expense of Elclogap, Governor of the Waters, in his original nature. While Ciallnech is said to be'beloved by Lucifer: Elelogap bears one of his names.

Anonymous addition to 166<; edition of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcrajt, regarding Weyer's hierarchy. The order of spirits in this hypothetical reconstruction of the hierar-chy is arranged much as they appear in Weyer, whose listing is the pri-mary source despite being incomplete. Weyer names 69, the Gaetia 72, while Scot correctly in my opinion - gives the total number as 79. Weyer also makes no distinction in his list regarding which are Chiefs, Kings and 'followers' among the 72 spirits. Scot's figure permits a combined hierarchy of three Chiefs, four Kings and 72 followers. As alternative and often ridiculous spellings of the spirits names are later than Weyer, his names have also been preferred to the corrupt Gaetia and Scot variants. Similarly, this listing includes the spirit Pruslas. mentioned by Weyer but mistakenly omitted from Scot and the Goe-tia; Astaroth has been raised from the list of 72 princes to the Chiefs as in Abrarnelin, VerHm and elsewhere, and with reservations -the additional spirits from the Goetia of Solomo~l have been added to Weyer's. Ir is my informed opinion that the Goetia of Solomon is a I7'h cen· tury reconstruction. It incorporates the spirit catalogue from the trans-lation of Weyer in Scot (first edition 1584, later editions appeared in 1657 and 1665; the manuscript translation of Weyer which Scot used dates to 1570, by one T.R.) and ritual elements from Robert Turner's translation of the Heptameron (1655). Both translations were from Latin, Turner's being of a far higher standard. No manuscript of the Goctia is earlier than these dates, and all are in English, and incorpo-rate many of the mistakes made by T.R. Assertions by many authors 162"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"A Unifzed Hierarchy that Verum depends on the Corti\" are utterly unfounded, and in fact somewhat mystifying. In actual content the two have extremely little in common: the rituals are different, the great majority of the spirits are different, as are all the sigils, the format of the two books and the basic approaches employed in each. I can only assume that many au-thors making this assertion are copying the statement to this effect in Waite's Black Magic, or each other. Such long lived literary continua-tion of an unsubstantiated supposition by uncritical repetition is un-fortunately not rare in occult literature. Returning to the synthesis of the spirit hierarchy of the Goetic gri-moires: the names of the Four Kings and the elements and directions to which they are attributed are taken from Agrippa. Not only was Agrippa the mentor of Weyer but also these are the most consistent and trustworthy correspondences even though they do not alone ex-plain all the relevant variants in Goetic literature. Some of these dif-ficulties in harmonising the various grimoires can likely be explained by widespread use of two attributions of the directions: the ZodiacaL as given here, and the more material attribution to the four winds. In this alternative schema East is associated with Air, South with Fire, West with Water and North with Earth. Thus for example in Weyer's text Paymon is said to be 'obedient unto Lucifer; consistent with the following table, while the reference to his association with the North is consistent with the alternative attribution of elements to directions. However, such attributions cannot be written in stone, and difficulties are likely to remain. As a final note, the Zodiacal attribution is more helpful to reconstruction in explaining Oriens' association with Fire, but in practice the title can simply be replaced with his other names if using the attribution by the winds."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The True Grimoire ATTRIBUTION OF GOETIC SPIRITS BY THE \\VINDS Ch('~f5 Belzebuth Lucifer Lucifer Belzcburh Astaroth Astarom Tarchimache (Lucit'ugc Satai1akia Agliarcpt Flerury Sargaranas Nebirotl Rofocalc) Kings Followers Baal Pruslas Buer Bathin Leraie Ipos Oriens r!Fire Agares Amon Gusoin Purson Valcfor Naberius Marbas Barbaros Boris Eligor Morax Glassylabol Zepar Paimon Forneus Cimieries Marchosias Sabnackc Amaymon South!

The origins of this particular spell are to be foundin Greek manuscripts of the Key of Solomon, at the very beginning of the Clavicle cycle. In some of these earlier versions the spell was specif. ically addressed direcrly to Hermes, god of the crossroads and of magic, as well as being performed on his day on tbe or 29th days of the Moon (the waning Moon assisting invisibility). 1hose familiar with Greek myth will re(all that Hermes was able to borrow the HeI· met ofInvisibility from the Underworld god, Hades. 111e long history of invisibility spells in general (an be studied in the excellent essay From the Ring of Gyges to the Black Cat Bone: A Historical Sun'ey of the 1 nvisibility Spells by Ioannis Marathakis. 1he particular form found in Verum connects with several of these, and is paralleled by the Gri· moire of Pope Honorius and the Book of Saint Cyprian. In many re· spects the Verum form represents the most complete development of this idea, with mythic elements reminiscent of the pagan magic of the Papyri beyond more mechanistic considerations of sympathetic magic. Aside from the history of invisibility spells in general this secret involves specific themes of occult symbolism with affinities in other magical traditions. Foremost among these is the making of magical beads, including the brazen oracular heads of medieval magicians. Of particular interest are New World methods for making such heads: for the intermediary crossroads spirit Exu, from a coconut and seven coins, and for Eleggua a cement head with seven coins inside it (and occasionally at least, seven cowries marking the holes of the head). Secondly the seven orifices of the head themselves appear in magical practice from Ancient Egypt onwards. connecting African and \\Vest-ern magical traditions. In Western magic these seven holes equate with the planets: the right and left ear to Saturn and Jupiter, the right and left nostrils to Mars and Venus, the right and left eye to Sun and Moon. and the mouth to Iv1ercury. In African magical religions in the New World this symbolism involves the Seven African Powers. It would therefore be both apt and useful to regard this secret as highly allegorical, the head rather than the 'beans of invisibility' being the important feature.

Nothing could be further from the truth, al-though the inferior quality of some editions may excuse such an impression. A thorough comparison of the variant texts can overcome this difficulty, especially when complemented with experimentation. From such an analysis it becomes clear that there are three distinct stages to the operations of the Grimoire. Firstly there is the manufac-ture or obtaining of the magical weapons, and their careful and painstaking preparation. Secondly, and centrally, there is the prepara-tion of the magical parchment, complete with sigils and conjurations. Thirdly there is the stage of active conjuration. The text tends to skip backwards and forwards between these stages -when describing the use of one of the instruments it often goes off on a tangent explaining its preparation -but once these three stages are identified the oper-ating procedure becomes fairly straightforward, though it could not be called simplistic or undemanding. So far as the demands of the practical operation of the system are concerned informed opinion is that corners should not be cut unnec-essarily. When the difficulties involved are those of inconvenience they may as well be surmounted if possible, after all they are in the spirit of the process and the majority were no easier when the rite was com-posed. Similarly, rational objections or prejudices regarding timing and other factors should be put aside rather than indulged. The use of planetary days and hours is simple enough, and enables the whole process to be 'special' and outside the normal run of experience. The use of rare or hard to obtain materials is also something the operator must carefully consider.

Perhaps the only place where substitution may be justified is in the slaying and skinning of a goat to make the parchment. 1he Grimoire gives a simpler alternative process for preparing vitgin paper; but it is also eminently possible and in accord with magical thinking to go through the motions of preparing this paper as if it were the skin of a goat -obtaining or making tbe materials needed and performing a symbolic slaying, scraping, coating with salt and weighting with stones for the required time before placing it in a Lim· ing Pot prepared in accordance with the procedures described in the Grimoire. For the authors of the grimoires the killing of an animal would be an everyday act accompanied by no strong feelings. For many modern westerners it would be an extreme experience accom-panied by feelings of revulsion and horror unintended by the original text and therefore inappropriate to the ritual. Among many reasons for approaching the process as wholeheart-edly as possible is the cultivation of the mythic sensibility. The parch. ment being such an important part of the whole theoretical and practical conception of Goetic there should be as little skimping as possible in its preparation. As said earlier, when it comes to making a Liming Pot -symbolic or not there are several versions of the in' scription given, but since the pot needs to be fairly large the operator could include more than one version. If for some reason a choice has to be made. then the sigils of suitable spirits are the best for reasons that should be clear from much that has been said above.

At this stage it should be pointed out that the traditional planetary hours are not the same as our one o'clock, two o'clock and so forth. 111e Planetary Hours of the Day are calculated by finding the number of minutes between Sunrise and Sunset and dividing by twelve; thus the first hour begins at local sunrise and consists of one twelfth of real daytime. The same process is then applied ro the time between local Sunset and Sunrise, to obtain the Planetary Hours of the Nighr. Since Saturday illustrates the pattern best we shall illustrate it witn the Day of Saturn as our example. Sunrise on Saturday begins the hour of Saturn, followed by the hour of Jupiter, then that of Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and the \\1oon, the eighth hour being again that of Saturn, and Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus ruling the remaining hours. Sunset on Saturday makes no change to the cycle, being ruled by Mer-cury and so the cycle continues through the night, until Sunrise on Sunday begins with the hour of the Sun.

In this division Lucifer rules Europe and Asia, Belzebuth Africa and Astaroth the Americas. In supposedly traditional systems of demonology Astaroth is often seen as a male. \"Ibis is something which will be discussed later. For our immediate purposes Astaroth is considered as similar to, if not identical with, a goddess of the pagan Canaanites and orhers, known as Astarte, and associated with Venus and the Moon. 111is is not necessarily a contradiction of the grimoires, which are remnants of older magic as well as systems in their own righr.\"nley arc by definition incomplete, and improved understanding requires research, patience and experience. Despite their shorrcomings, and their frequent inaccuracies, it is unwise to make changes without first gaining this understanding and experience. To do so can often worsen the results rather than improve them. The difference between the gri-moires and the approach described here is a consequence of the more individual and personal nature of the spirits as they are encountered in this manner of working. It is also a result of the correspondence of this approach to magic as it existed long before the medieval period. Astaroth has as her deputies in the True Grimoire the spirits Sar-gatanas and Nebiros, who in turn rule over many spirits, particularly Nebiros. Besides these important hierarchical relationships Astaroth has an affinity with one, and only one, of the other spirits of the True Grimoirc, 111is affinity is with the Emperor Lucifer himsclf~ and no other spirit has such an affinity.

As a relationship between Chiefs it is an important affinity, and one with many consequences and impli. cations. While Lucifer is the ultimate ruler of all the spirits, and is seldom invoked directly, Astaroth's affinity with him, along with her own im~ portant position, makes her the ideal Chief for magicians to work with. Astaroth is by far the most approachable of the three Chiefs. and the magician who works with her will find her affinity with the Emperor a most useful quality. Together wirh the relationship with Scirlin that every magician working the True Grimoire must have, a relationship with Astaroth has the potential to draw the favour of Lucifer towards the magician. In addition. the affinity between these chief., can confer on the magician many of the benehts that Lucifer would bestow. 111 is is in marked contrast to working with Belzebuth, who is harder in nature, and less forgiving of £1.ilings in ritual proce-dure.

Astrologically this star is associated with luck, pride, wealth, ambition, good repu-tarion, fame, honours, occult interests, and dog bites.

ASTAROTH IN THE NIIDDLE EAST AND IN EGYPT l11e history of Astaroth in the Middle East and Egypt is long and complex. It involves millennia of time, a vast swathe of geography and several language groups, besides a multiplicity of roles. Just one of her oldest forms, the Sumerian 1nanna, has been called the manyJlceted goddess, lrwmw. Besides this there are the syncretic associations; the goddesses with whom she bas been identified, or who she has ab-sorbed, or who have absorbed qualities from her. To resolve all these complex issues clearly and meaningfully here is an impossible task. 203"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"TIlC True Grimoire To serve a useful purpose. appropriate to the work in hand. it is enough to trace the main line of descent from Sumeria to Ptolemaic Egypt and clarify her most important roles. Sumerian ];1<1nn(l A principal role of Inanna was fertility. initially perhaps in relation to the date palm. but extending to wool, meat and grain. One of her key symbols in relation to this role was the gate post of the store· bouse. Her myth involved a marriage on the day of harvest, to her lover Dumuzi, who is a form of the dying god common to the fertility cults of the region. This form of Inanna probably involved one of her other key roles, as a deity of storm and rain. In this guise the lion is as with other storm deities a key attribute. She drives a chariot drawn by seven lions, rides a lion, or is herself a lion. In one of her myths she also borrows the other thunder animal, the Bull of Heaven, the roaring of both animals was heard in the thunder. Among her ti-tles are; 'Inanna, the great storm of heaven'. 1his attribute relates both to her fertility aspect and to her warlike nature, as thunder she is 'the destroyer of mountains, who lent the storm wings'. As the rain her natute is gentler, and life giving: T stcr onto the heavens. (/nd the min rains dO!V~I, 1 step onto the earth, arid grass and JJerbs sprout Hr. It is in her role of thunder goddess that her warlike nature likely orig-inates. Certainly one of the key manifestations of Asraroth from this point on is as a lion-headed war goddess, and Inanna is known as a war goddess from very early myths. Another key role ofInanna is as goddess of Venus as both Morn-ing and Evening Star. Interesting in this respect is that in this form the goddess holds court at New Moons to hear petitions from those in distress. As Evening Star too she judges the just and the unjust. As the Morning Star represented productive work. so tbe Evening Star represented rest and recreation, and another key role ofInanna follows from this; Inanna as harlot, goddess of music and dance, the 204"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"protector of prostitutes and of alehouses. 'The Morning Star on the other hand was also associated with her as goddess of war, a symbol-ism of surprisingly wide distribution among peoples of Asiatic de-scent. Implicit in her warlike role it is a fair inference to see ideas of punishment and vengeance following on her judgements. All these roles are found in the Akkadian (and general Semitic) Ishtar, with whom Inanna was identified. lbe name Ishtar derives through the intermediary ft1rm of Eshtar from that of Attar, the name of a West Semitic god of Venus as Morning Star, and of rain. As his female counterpart Astarte (the older form is Attart, the fem-inine form of the male name), she represented Venus as Evening Star, as well as rain, war and sexual love. These are only the main qualities of the goddess, whose multi-faceted nature possesses at the same time an abiding unity of characterisation. TI1ere are certainly other complexities that are at present beyond the resolution of the deepest scholars. For example the precise nature of her relationship to the goddess Anath, and to Asherah, has yet to be discerned. What matters here is that the principle symbol of Asherah, the ceremonial pole that bears her name, is also associated with Astarte. This important symbol is also the post sacred to Inanna. As Astarte or Ashtoreth she was the foremost goddess of the Semitic Phoenicians and Canaanites. Under the name Tanit she was also the principal goddess of the Phoenician colony of Carthage, who bore all the same attributes. 17Jf IVlystcrics of Isis <md Osiris is the title of an important work by Plutarch from which most of our knowledge of those Mysteries is de-rived, and which studies of monuments and papyri have only enlarged upon. TI1e story is flmiliar enough, and only some derails concern this study. When Set doses Osiris in a chest and throws it in the Nile, it is carried away by the river, our ro sea, finally coming to shore again at Byblos. Byblos was an extremely ancient Phoenician city, and the centre of the worship of Tammuz, a form of the dying god akin (0 Dumuzi the lover of 1nanna. TIle Greeks adopted the rites of Adonis from here as early as the century Be, the name Adonis being derived from the Phoenician word Adon meaning Lord. 205"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The True Grim()lrc In the Egyptian story Isis traces the chest to Byblos, where an impres-sive tamarisk tree has swiftly grown around it and been removed as a pillar for the palace of ~een Astarte and her husband Melkarthus (Melqart, another important Phoenician deity, called by the Greeks the Celestial Hercules). That these two figures are as divine as Isis, or only as human as she, is certain. It is also extremely likely that this part of the story explains the relationship between the Mysteries of Isis and Osiris, and those of the Semitic goddesses and their dying consorts. It is in fact extremely likely that a wordplay has extended the word by bios (initially a reference to thoroughly Egyptian papyrus swamps; papyrus being what paper, and thus books or bibles, are made from), to the Phoenician city. The tamarisk tree is mentioned in Baby-lonian laments for the god: A tamarisk th,lt in the garden has dnmk no water, whose crown in the field h\"s brouglnIorth 110 blossom. One version of this myth has it that Isis did not take back the body of Osiris to Egypt, bur that he was buried at Byblos and it was in his honour that the festival of Adonis was held.. It is very apparent that Egyptian and Semitic religions had a pl)tem mutual influence upon one another. In particular the importation of Astarre and Baal into Egypt influenced the rites of Isis and Osiris; much as Egyptian art in-fluenced the depiction of Semitic gods in their original homes. 'Ihe lamentations of Astarre for Adonis or Ishtar for Tammuz were little different from those of Isis tt)r Osiris, as may be seen in Frazer's dated but still useful Golden Bough, While this connection is extremely significant, this is not the only appearance of our goddess in Egyptian religion and history. 'The adop-tion of the Semitic lion-headed war goddess Ashtoreth, by the Egyp-tians, probably occurred by about 1800 Be. Under the names Astherter or Astharthet she was strongly associated with the use of horse and chariot in war, which the Egyptians possessed no earlier than this time. Her cult persisted from then, on through the Ptolemaic period, and on to the beginning of the Chrisrian era, As a goddess oflove she 206"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Astaroth was identified with Hathor or Isis-Harhor in one or more of her forms. 111e imporrance of the pole or pillar in the culr of Hathor is also well attested. As a goddess of war Asrhertet was identified with the Goddess Sekhmet. She was also associated with the Moon and called 'mistress of horses, lady of the chariot, dweller in Apollinopolis Magna'; (Behutet to the Egyptians, the modern Edfu, seat of the wor-ship of Horus of Behutet, known in modern occultism as Hadit). In the legendary conflict between Set and Horus both Asthertet and Anath are given as wives to Set in order to placate him for the terms of a peace settlement which favours Horus. Note also that Set was partnered with Taurt, the most ancient and popular of Mother god-desses in Egypt, as well as with Nepthys, the mother of Anubis. ASTARTE IN THE GREEK AND ROMAN \\VORLD As seen, the assimilation of one goddess with another, from one na-tion to another, was an early feature of religion in the Middle East. 111i8 process accelerated with the conquests of Alexander, and throughout the Hellenistic period. With the rise of the Roman Em-pire the process accelerated still further, both in syncretic combina-tions and in the dissemination of Eastern religions in Europe. Astarte, Artemis and Isis became identified with one another and with other goddesses, such as Aphrodite; who had indeed originated in the East rather than Greece; and with equal justification was identified with Cybele and Rhea. As the Syrian Goddess, or Syria Dea, Astarte's worship spread throughout the Empire, rivalled only by that of Isis, with whom in any case she was strongly associated. Her status, ac-cordingly, at the beginning of the Christian era, from where she de-clines to the status of a demon of questionable gender, could hardly be greater. 207"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Tilt' True Grimoirc ASTAROTH AND HECATE By the mysteries of the deep, by thc .~ames of Banal, l,y the power of the East, and the silcnce (~f ti,e night. /)y tlJe ')O/y rites of Hecate, I col~jure and exorcise thee ... spirit oj' N. deceased, to answer my liege demamis, being oi,edient tmto these sacred ccremonies on pain ofcl'crlasting torment and distrcss: BERArD, BE1WAU), BAI.BTN GAB GABOR AGABA: Arise. arise I chargc and command tl,ee.

As a triple goddess she is often described as having three bodies, or three heads: in the early classical period these are human heads, later she is found with animal heads, as l'vfistress of Beasts. She can be found with the heads of a lion and a mare. and one either of a dog or a boar; in the Magical Papyri other variations occur: in PGM IV. 2 I 20-2 I 23 she has the head of a cow on the right, the head of a female dog 011 the left, and the head of a girl in the centre; in PGM IV. 2881-2884 she has the head of a goat on the right. a female dog on the left, and in the middle that of a horned girl.

Dogs, black female lambs and honey were offered to her on highways and where three roads met, hence her tirle Trivia or three-ways, and at crossroads. Crossroads in many tradi-tions represent a place between worlds, specifically the worlds ofmor-tals and of immortals. In exchange for such offerings she could carry messages to and fro between these worlds, and as a power of justice she could intercede with them. The Athenians considered her as a patron of families and of chil-dren (her title as nurturer of the young was Kourorrophos), as also of the poor and defenceless in generaL Her statues were accordingly otten to be found at the doorway of the house (as guardian of the limefl, the doorstep she was Limenoskopos; a related title is Propylaia, the One before the Gate). 'n1e oldest forms of her image, whether at the crossroads or the doorway, consisted of a pole, which as shown by Rabinowitz -is retained even in later statuary. Upon it were hung her masks, generally three in number. At New Moon - which as seen earlier is the time when Inanna held court it was the custom for the richest people to provide a feast and set it in the streets for the poor. Afterwards, as part of the rite, these beneficiaries of the custom duly reported that Hecate had de-voured the feast. At this time too expiatory offerings were made, to placate the goddess for any evil done that might influence the public good. 'TI1is again is reminiscent of the court of Inanna, where she judged the guilty and innocent according to their deeds; like her Hecate possessed authority to judge, and to reward or punish. So great was her power that it extended over land and sea, the heavens and the underworld, and kings and nations credited her with what-ever prosperity they might possess. She participated actively in the search for Demeter's daughter Persephone after her abduction by Hades, and became her constant companion upon her discovery.

Thus in the Gnostic Christian text the Pis tis Sophia she is spoken of as fol-lows: The third order is called Triple-faced Hecate, and there are under her authority seven-and-twenty arch-demons, and it is they which enter into men and seduce them to perjuries and lies and to covet that which does not belong to them. 111e souls then which Hecate beareth hence in ravishment, she handeth over to her demons which stand under her, in order that they may torment them through her dark smoke and her wicked fire, they being exceedingly afflicted through the demons. And they spend one-hundred-and-five years and six months, being chastised in her wicked chastisements; and they begin to be dissolved and destroyed. In her role as an underworld deity in the late pagan period she was a major and formidable figure.

'TIle C/w/dean Oracles of Zoroaster, are probably Grieco-Egyptian in origin but influenced by Hermetically inspired Zurvanist Chaldean sources.

[She J having first received the powers of all things in Her Ineffable Bosom, pours forth perpetual generation on all things. Because she receives and holds within her bosom, and transmits on-wards the 'Life Bearing Fire', she is for these initiates the ultimate goddess not merely of generation, but of spiritual regeneration. -This fiery theology incidentally, is identical (if not in source then in inspiration) to that expressed in The Prayer of the Salammulers by which Astaroth is conjured in the so-called Cahilla of the Green But-terfly in the True Grimoire. The 'Fire Philosophy' of the Oracles is that espoused by the titular hero of Lc Comte de Gahalis.

Accordingly Saint Valentine's Day is a testament to the influence of Gnosticism, and of Astaroth, that has survived for centuries. It is striking too that Sophia -the Gnostic deity of Wisdom possesses several qualities originating with !shtar or Astaroth, divine harlot not least among them.

Not only was Hecate similar in nature alld origin to whether in the ancient period or more recently they have also oped very similar roles in magic. 'Ihey are often invoked at they command numerous spirits, they are both associated with Cer-berus aka Nebiros, they both have a lunar nature, the lion and the horse belong to them both, and the pole or pillar is their common symboL Given the ancient connections drawn between Hecate and Artemis on the one hand, and Artemis and Astarte on the other, a similar linkage of Hecate and Astaroth in magical tradition with one name giving way to the other -is unsurprising. This connection may be perceived at work in the 1estamel1t of S%lnon. Here'the bonds of Artemis' are predicted (by the seventh of Pleiades, presumably Alcyone) to be the cause of Solomon's ulti-mate downfall. Similarly, in the Bible it is Astaroth whose worship supposedly leads to Solomon's fall (1 Kings, II, 6.), while in the Mag-ical Papyri contemporary with the Te5tamolt Artemis is fully identified with Hecate. TIle same text speaks of sinister events at the crossroads, using terms that may easily refer to Hecate, such as her title Enol'lia. 212"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"It is a notable fact that an amulet of the Roman period was discovered at a crossroads in Ostia. depicting on one side King Solomon. stirring a magical cauldron. and on the other the triple-bodied form of Hecate. both figures surrounded by magical symbols. of which some are recog-nisable in Solomonic grimoires. \\Vhile some modern associations between ancient deities and spir-its are very tenuous, particularly in relation to magical practicalities, this association is very dose and also eminently practical. It is practical in a magical and cosmological sense. The ancient associations of Hecate transfer very readily to Astaroth in our own times. \\\\;'hile the role of Hecate appears to gradually lessen after the medieval period, the same role is picked up by Astaroth, and increases in inverse pro-portion as that of Hecate diminishes. Going back to the Magical Pa-pyri we also see a possible analogue to the gender Hipping nature of Astaroth in the nature of Ilecate. -n1is is in the magical fusion of ideas concerning Hecate as Goddess of the Crossroads and Hermes as God thereof: In the Magical Papyri, and indeed long bef()re, a marked slur-ing of attributes can be seen between these messenger deities, so that for example Hecate was portrayed with the caduceus wand of Hermes. -Ihis was in f:lct a long established feature of Greek mythology and. the Mystery cults from which much of the magic of the Papyri is de-rived, for example that of the Idaean Dactyls. In addition the magical name Hermecate -a cornbination of their names - appears in the pa-pyri. Given this near interchangeable quality it is not unlikely that a flexibility of gender resulted. -nlis may in turn have complicated the partial picture resulting from the decline of the magical tradition and the loss of much of its original lore. Among the losses in ancient mythology which could clarify our understanding are to be counted the persistent but incomplete con-nections of the legend of Perseus and Andromeda with both Astarte and Ii.ecate. For example: Hecate is called Perseis or Persian, and the name of that race in Greek myth was supposed. to derive from Perses, son of Perseus and Andromeda. So Hesiod makes lIeeate the daugh-ter of Perses and Asteria. Astarte on the other hand, in an Egyptian myth that is unf()rtunarely very incompletely preserved, is rescued 213"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"True Grimoire from a sea-monster who wishes to have her as its mate, by none other than the fierce and cunning Set; this clearly resembles the myth of Perseus and Andromeda. It is known that in some of her forms Astarte was represented as fish-tailed and had many marine connec-tions (many of her images resemble a mermaid or Siren). Hecate's do-minion similarly, while often spoken of as Heaven, Earth and Hell also paralleled the three worlds of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, the Sky, Sea and Underworld. Whatever the solution to these mythic conundrums. a great deal is to be gained by considering Hecate and Astaroth as similar in na-ture. even reflections of each other. It is distinctly to our advantage to consider Hecate as a higher manifestation of Astaroth. Thus we in-crease our magical options. vVe may certainly conjure Astaroth by means of the adapted format of the Grimoire; however. we also have the option of performing a divine invocarion of Hecate. Then, by iden-tifying ourselves with her, with her authority Astaroth may be bidden to appear as a hypostasis. THE GENDER OF ASTAROTH 111e depiction of Astaroth as male in the Goetia ~fSolomml is an error that appears to originate in translations of the writings of Weyer (the original Latin contains no references to gender, which appear only in the English, the use of he in translation is largely a formality). Scot, who was using a very faulty transcript into English, unwittingly imi-tated this error; from references to Astarte in his own writings it is unlikely he would have made it otherwise. From both these sources it found its way into the grimoires, which contrary to popular imagina-tion are largely late compilations. The error was frequently remarked upon by later writers. and evenlighdy lampooned by the witty author Colin De Plancy, who portrayed the male Astaroth marrying or rather re-uniting with - a Phoenician Moon Goddess (Astarte). This same identity was also evidently known to Eliphas Levi. in whose al-leged fragment of the Key ~f Solomon appear the words: 214"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Astaroth lhe Chief or Guide of these Demons is Astaroth or Astarte, the impure Venus of the Syrians, whom they represent with the head of an ass or of a bull, and the breasts of a woman. Nevertheless, the incorporation of details derived from \\Veyer and Scot into influential grimoires has unfortunately perpetuated the error to the present day. In some respects however, this is unimportant, as Canaanite deities occasionally undergo gender flips in their original historical contexts. Also the planets Mercury and Venus frequently have male/female pairs of deities associated with them, personifying the Morning and Evening Star forms of those planets. Indeed the Canaanite Athtar, the male form of the name of the planet Venus, is the origin of the fem-inine form of the name. Thus the gender of Astaroth on a particular occasion may be determined by the position of Venus in relation to the Sun. As a male when Venus rises before the Sun, and as a female when Venus rises after the Sun. However, since the male female pairs are nor a constant feature of Astarte's identity, it is equally likely that both forms will be female. Many modern magicians (of the Western revival specifically) insist that the identity of Astaroth the demon and Astarte the goddess should not to be made in practice. Their arguments are sometimes difficult to comprehend, and apparently consist of treating the exact form of the grimoires as in some way sacrosanct: mistranslations, omissions, errors and alL [n doing so they set aside the identification of pagan deities with demons by early Christian authors - from which the entire problem originates as well as the same identification by profound occult scholars, and in broader culture and literature. For example, Robert Turner who in the n,b century translated many of the grimoires into English, plainly identified the 'devils' with their pagan namesakes; not as approximations, but as one and the same. So roo did Milton in his epic poem, Paradise Lost. The position of these modern traditionalists may be based on their perception of the practicalities that the demon is best treated with 215"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The True Grimoirc via the grimoires, and the goddess by resort to pagan religiolls forms. However, goddesses with Chthonic roles and dominion over the Un-derworld are frequently encountered in the grimoires and the older sources that underlie them, such as the Magical Papyri. TI1e distinc-tion therefore, while perhaps fair enough for purist approaches to specific grimoires, certainly does not apply when approaching Astaroth as a Chthonic or Underworld deity. Needless to say, such an approach would also involve a departure from the usual grimoire format. It should be kept in mind that the gradual demonising of Chthonic religion has been an ongoing process, in Greek, Roman and Semitic cultures among others. Accordingly a nco-Chthonic reclamation of these figures in our time is entirely jus-tified, regardless of their roles within the demon ising culture. Any in-telligent and responsible exponents of the grimoires should be capable of seeing this is exactly what is taking place here. The identification of a demonised deity with the original is therefore theoretically and historically correct so long as an appropriate ritual structure and cos-mology is employed. In other words, if as the result of an antagonistic theology deities can be transformed into demons, by force of a more compatible perspective the process may be reversed. TIle Brazilian syncretism of gods, spirits and demons of Western culture with their Exus and Pomba Giras has another way of resolv-ing this apparent difficulty: Astaroth (the male demon) is associated with Exu Rei das Sete Encruzilhadas; Astarte (the female deity) is associated with Pomba Gira Rainha das Sete Encruzilhadas. lhis eminently practical and magical approach to the problem has much to recommend it, it is what we might expect from a living tra-dition rather than the best efforts of an occult revival divorced from its roots.

This approach contrasts strongly with the supposedly traditional attitude of threatening the spirits with knives and considering them without distinction as agents of evil in terms of a theology that is alien to their origins. Similarly a cold, dispassionate and mechanistic ap-proach is incomplete and unsatisfactory, and certainly gives no inkling of the approach employed by its authors and the magicians of their day.

The Brazilian cults of Umbanda and Quimbanda include a good deal of diversity.

I base this deduction on several points.

Obscure matters become clearer, as previously undetected con-nections and implications come to light. so that understanding can not only improve but undergo transformations. This has certainly been the case in the long process of reconstructing and commenting the True Grimoire. Among the points clarified for me by this project is the way grimoires mutate. absorbing new ideas. contemporary be-liefs and exotic elements from the time in which they were composed, as well as transmitting elements from earlier times. The Key of Solomol1 is more a generic title than a monolithic and unchanging source. The idea of an Ur book in back of the variations of the Key of SolomoH, is misleading. ll1ere may be firsts in terms of particular elements or strands, but behind each are other interpreta-tions and traditions leading in a variety of directions. The later grimoires were often aimed directly at an increasingly literate lower class, or at magicians among them, and simultaneously reflected and influenced popular belief. In the same way the much ear' lier magical papyri may have been owned by ritual specialists, bur re-flected the beliefs and view of the world, both natural and supernatural, of the people around them, with whom these specialists were in close contact. In the history of the grimoires there are many themes relating to popular beliefs, perhaps surprisingly given the illiteracy of much of the population during the greater part of that history. In illiteracy is less of a factor than appears, given that in some periods the Church actively sought to not suppress but adapt magical thinking in the wider culture. Preaching, word of mouth and folk memory played ac-tive roles in disseminating or changing ideas, that in turn are reflected in written works. In addition what people believe about magical books and those who own them is often as important as the actual contents of those books. 255"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY + MANUSCRIPTS AND EDITIONS OF THE GRIMOIRES Le Dragon Rouge, ou IArt ,Ie ComnhJ;uier les Esprits infernaux.
