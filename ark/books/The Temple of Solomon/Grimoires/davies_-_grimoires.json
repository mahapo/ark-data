Some might nominate thefounding texts of our major religions, which through misinterpretationand manipulation have led to the suVering of millions over the centuries. Othersmight point to deWning modern political works such as Karl Marx’sDas Kapital,Hitler’sMein Kampf, or Chairman Mao’sLittleRed Book. Fiction can also gravelyoVend public sensibilities, as we have seen in recent decades with book burningsof theSatanic VersesandHarry Potternovels. But for many down the millennia andacross the globe no books have been more feared than grimoires: then again, nobooks have been more valued and revered.‘Grimoire’ has a familiar ring to many people, particularly following thepopularity of such ‘teen witch’ dramas asBuVy the Vampire SlayerandCharmed,but few people are sure what it means, and my computer spellchecker certainlydoes not know what to make of it. Put simply, then, grimoires are books ofconjurations and charms, providing instructions on how to make magical objectssuch as protective amulets and talismans. They are repositories of knowledge thatarm people against evil spirits and witches, heal their illnesses, fulWl their sexualdesires, divine and alter their destiny, and much else besides. Grimoires are booksof magic, then, but not all books of magic are grimoires, for as we shall see, somemagic texts were concerned with discovering and using the secrets of the naturalworld rather than being based on the conjuration of spirits, the power of words, orthe ritual creation of magical objects. The derivation of ‘grimoire’ is not entirelycertain. In the early nineteenth century it was suggested that it came from theItalian ‘rimario’, a book of rhymes or Bible verses. It more likely derives from theFrench word ‘grammaire’, which originally referred to a work written in Latin.By the eighteenth century it was being widely used in France to refer to magicbooks, perhaps because many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscriptsat a time when most other publications were in French. It was used as aWgure ofspeech to denote something that was diYcult to read or impossible to understand,such as, ‘it is like a grimoire to me’.1It was only in the nineteenth century, withthe educated resurgence of interest in the occult, that it began to enter generalEnglish usage."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"DeWning the meaning of magic is a far trickier task. For all the time, paper, andintellectual energy spent on trying to do so, there is no overarching answer. Anyuseful understanding must be tied to the cultures of the people being studied inspeciWc periods and places.2The boundary between religion and magic is certainlynever clear-cut and changes over time and in relation to diVerent religious beliefsystems. This will become clear in theWrst chapter. What is worth stating now isthat grimoires never represented the totality of people’s experience and know-ledge of magic in the past. There are numerous charms, spells, and rituals thatwere passed down orally through many generations, and were only recorded inwriting by folklorists and antiquarians in the nineteenth century. Furthermore,women have always been as important as men in the recorded history of magicalpractice, yet because of their restricted access to literacy, they play only a minorrole in the story of grimoires until the sixteenth century.Grimoires exist because of the desire to create a physical record of magicalknowledge, reXecting concerns regarding the uncontrollable and corruptiblenature of the oral transmission of valuable secret or sacred information. Thisurge to provide a tangible magical archive dates right back to the ancient civil-ization of Babylonia in the second millenniumbce. But grimoires also existbecause the very act of writing itself was imbued with occult or hidden power.‘A book of magic is also a magical book,’ as one historian of the subject hasobserved.3As this suggests, I am concerned with the history of books and not justthe magic they contained. It is important to understand their meaning and socialsigniWcance, and to consider the endless attempts by religious and secular author-ities to censor and suppress them. In this sense, grimoires represent much morethan magic.4They tell us about fundamental developments in history over the pasttwo thousand years. To understand their past is to understand the spread ofChristianity and Islam, the development of early science, the cultural inXuenceof print, the growth of literacy, the social impact of slavery and colonialism, andthe expansion of Western cultures across the oceans.This story concerns the spread of written magic from the ancient Middle East,through Europe and then across the Atlantic, but it is important to highlight thatother venerable literary cultures also enshrined their magical knowledge in writ-ing and considered writing magical. India’s literary heritage, in particular, was amajor inXuence across much of south Asia. The various Batak ethnic groups ofSumatra, for instance, have long had a semi-literate culture, perhaps for a millen-nium and more. Their alphabet is based on the Brahmi script, the earliest examplesof which have been found in Southern India, dating to the third centurybce.Writing was primarily a tool of magic for the Batak, preserving their magicaltradition more faithfully than oral transmission. The art of writing was largely thepreserve of thedatuor priest-magician, who recorded it in magic books (poestaha)2|Introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"inscribed on the inner bark of thealimtree and folded like an accordion.5Theliterary magic of the East also inXuenced the West through early trading links.Magic squares consisting of a grid of numbers of astrological, metaphysical, ormystical signiWcance are thought to have spread westwards from China in the lateWrst millennium thanks to Persian and Arab traders. The magic square also becamean integral element of Indian magic, perhaps around the same time as papermak-ing was introduced there from China in the eighth century. One of the earliestsurviving Indian expositions of the art was a book of mathematics written in1356.Other elements of astrological magic alsoWltered from India into the writings ofIslamic Arab and Persian scientists and magicians.6Books can be magical without actually containing magic. In the past, unedu-cated people identiWed certain physical attributes of books, such as large size,venerable appearance, and contents full of unfamiliar signs,Wgures, and languagesas indicative of magical purpose. Practitioners of magic sometimes displayed bookswhich matched these characteristics in their consulting rooms to give the impres-sion that they were adepts in the occult arts, even though the texts had nothing todo with magic. Some books were also used as protective talismans.7The mostobvious example is the Bible, which people placed under their pillow to protectthem from witches and evil spirits, or touched when swearing oaths. It was alsoused in popular divination. By placing a key at certain passages in the Bible,binding and then suspending it, the divine power enshrined in the ‘good book’would make it turn in response to the name of a thief. The Bible was obviouslynot a grimoire, but the power of the words, stories, psalms, and prayers itcontained, as well as its holiness as an object, made it the most widely usedmagic resource across the social and cultural spectrum over the past thousandyears. Passages written on scraps of paper were used as healing charms, and thepsalms were read for magical eVect. So as we shall see, in the Christian world theBible has always been thought a necessary companion of the grimoire, and bothwere required to make magic.It is no wonder, then, that as Christianity spread across the European coloniesnatives wondered whether the Bible was the occult source of power of the whitecolonizers. Amongst the peoples of parts of Africa, South America, the Caribbean,and the South PaciWc, anthropologists have found a widespread notion that thewhite man deliberately withheld the full power of Christianity in order to keepthem in a state of subjugation. This was not necessarily achieved by restrictingliteracy, but by deliberately withholding some of thetrueBible and therefore thecomplete key to wisdom, knowledge, and consequently power.8In the Caribbeantoday, for instance, the Bible is considered by some as an African divine textappropriated and controlled by Europeans. When asked why he accepted theBible but not Catholicism, a worshipper of the Trinidadian spirit religion ofIntroduction|3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Orisha explained, ‘The Bible came from Egypt; it was stolen by the Catholics whoadded and removed parts for their own purposes.’9As we shall see, such notionsproved fertile ground for the spread of grimoires that purported to contain thesemissing parts. The notion that sacred knowledge has been withheld was not just aproduct of colonial tensions. The Bible, as we know it, is the result of a highlyselective and political process of compilation. The elements that make up theBible were chosen from a diverse range of biblical texts. Yet the Church nevermanaged to suppress those apocryphal biblical gospels, histories, stories, andevents dismissed and excluded from the oYcial Bible story. This alternativeliterary biblical tradition became the source of numerous magical traditions thatcontinue today.A grimoire is deWned by the writing it contains, but the act of writing can itselfbe magic and certain words can have active properties independent of the holy ormagical text in which they are written. Their power could be stimulated by theritual use of speciWc inks and blood. Across the world from antiquity to the presentweWnd the notion, for example, that the writing in sacred texts was imbued withphysical divine power that could be utilized by eating or drinking it. In Numbers5in the Old Testament it is instructed that a woman suspected of adultery couldbe brought to a priest who would make her undergo the ordeal of bitter water:‘And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out withthe bitter water. And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water thatcauseth the curse.’ If she is guilty ‘the water that causeth the curse shall enter intoher, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and thewoman shall be a curse among her people.’ If innocent the divine written cursewould not be activated.The ingestion of holy writing was normally employed for healing purposes. Inmedieval Europe sacred words were written on bread or cheese to be swallowedby the sick. Some medieval religious manuscripts bear the signs of having beenrinsed with water so that some of the ink washed oVand could therefore be drunk.The seventh-century Book of Durrow, an illuminated manuscript of the Gospels,is a good example. In the seventeenth century it was dunked in water by Irishfarmers to produce a sacred medicine for curing sick cattle. In parts of IslamicWest Africa passages of the Koran written out in ink are similarly washed anddrunk to cure disease and witchcraft. Amongst the Berti of northern Darfur, thefakis(Koranic teachers and healers) write certain verses from the Koran on awooden slate, using a pen made from a millet stalk and ink made from a mix ofsoot and gum Arabic. The water is then washed oVinto a small bowl or bottle forclients to drink either at once or in small doses throughout the day. As part of theirgraduation ceremony the Batakdatumade his students inscribe an incantation,dictated by him, on bamboo held over a heap of boiled rice. The scratchings4|Introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"produced by inscribing fell onto the rice, and the ritual was completed when theboys ate the rice and with it ‘the soul of the writing’.10If writing was so important to grimoire magic what was the eVect of the printrevolution from the lateWfteenth century onwards? Magicians had no personalinXuence over the creation of print grimoires, could not imbue them with powerthrough the ritual use of materials. The printed book was not integral to themagic, rather a record of it. Magicians were merely purchasers of a product.The importance of print was its role in democratizing literary magic.11Thepresses could produce copies in far greater numbers and far more quickly thanscribes, and so the knowledge of the learned few became available to the expand-ing literate masses. While print drained power from the grimoire in terms of itsmagical integrity, it also empowered it through growing access and social inXu-ence. Furthermore, print did not usurp the role of manuscript; the magic latent inthe words contained in print grimoires could be reactivated through transcription.Neither did print cheapen the aura of grimoires. It is true that the power of literarymagic was in part invested in the restricted access to literacy, which is one reasonwhy the history of grimoires needs to be sensitive to gender inequalities. Until thetwentieth century the literacy rates of women lagged far behind men. Yet, as weshall see, even in the age of mass-produced grimoires and near universal educationthere was a widespread perception that the ability to read was not the onlyrequirement for using them. The qualities of the magician remained important.Whether by birth right, geography, or piety only certain people were thought tohave the innate power to possess and perform grimoire magic on the behalf ofothers. So even when grimoires were available to everyone not everyone coulduse them safely and eVectively.To end this brief introduction let me pose some riddles. What links Chicago toancient Egypt, Germany to Jamaica, and Norway to Bolivia? How did a Swedebecome the greatest wizard in America? What didRastafarians and Alpine farmershave in common? Who is the ‘Little Albert’ famed from Canada to the IndianOcean? And how did a poor crossing-sweeper from Ohio become a fearedmythical spirit in the Caribbean? Grimoires provide all the answers. They notonly reXected the globalization of the world but helped shape it. The key to theirextraordinary inXuence lies back in the ancient world of the Middle East, which iswhere our journey now begins.Introduction|5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CHAPTERONEANCIENT ANDMEDIEVALGRIMOIRESThe modern history of ancient and medieval magic is vast and often inaccessibleto the non-expert, yet there is much to catch the imagination and challengeour understanding of religion and society in past eras. While European grimoireswere largely a product of the medieval period their inspiration lies much furtherback in the religions of the ancient civilizations of the Near and Middle East.In the eastern Mediterranean the religious traditions of paganism, Judaism,Christianity, and later Islam rubbed oVon each other despite the obvious antag-onisms in terms of competing political inXuence. How medieval scholars under-stood that distant past and reconstructed it, often wrongly, was as important to thehistory of magic as the magical knowledge actually passed down during theWrstmillennium.The cross-fertilized intellectual culture of the Middle East was introduced tomost of Europe during the Middle Ages, at a time when the Continent has oftenbeen portrayed as being in the grip of a bigoted and zealous Church, a period ofreligious intolerance with the Crusades against Islam, the setting up of Inquisi-tions, and pogroms against the Jews. This portrayal is far from being completelyunjustiWed, yet the medieval era was also an age of extraordinary scholarlycollaboration and understanding between diVerent religions and cultures. Thewritings of the pagan ancient Greeks,Romans, and Egyptians were translated andpored over, and churchmen travelled across Europe to immerse themselves in theArabic sciences and Jewish mysticism taught in the schools of Spain and southernFrance. Magic was seen as an aspect of science as well as religion, and its roots were"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"traced back thousands of years through the wider reconstruction of the history ofwritten knowledge. So to understand the origins of the grimoire we must explorethe ancient world through the prism of the medieval intellectual mind.Ancient masters of magicThe ancient Greeks andRomans believed that the priests of a Persian tribe, theMagi, were theWrst practitioners of magic, taught to them by their founderZoroaster. The ‘wise men from the East’ who came bearing gifts for the babyJesus were their representatives. According to the naturalist and military manPliny the Elder, writing in theWrst centuryce, ‘without doubt magic wasWrstinvented over there in Persia by Zoroaster . . . But it is not established whetherthere was just one man of this name or whether there was another one afterwardtoo.’ He went on to report that the Greek mathematician Eudoxus calculated thatZoroaster lived six thousand years before the death of Plato. That would put theage of Zoroaster and the birth of magic to around6347 bce. But Pliny went on tomake a distinction between the invention of magic and when it wasWrst writtendown. As far as he could discover, theWrst man to do that was a Persian magicianand astrologer named Osthanes, who accompanied King Xerxes in his failed warwith Greece (480 bce), and in the process ‘scattered, as it were, the seeds of thehideous craft along the way, infecting the world with it’.1In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, which were ultimately inXuencedby Babylonian myth, the origins of magic books were dated to the age before thegreat Flood. While some Hebrew and Samaritan texts ascribed writings to theWrstman Adam, in late antiquity and the medieval period Enoch (Idris in Arabic) wasmore generally believed to be the inventor of books. As is evident from fragmentsof the famed Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves around Qumran near the Dead Seain the mid-twentieth century, purportedBooks of Enochcontaining astronomical,astrological, and angelic lore were circulating at the time of Jesus. According toone medieval account, Enoch’s great-grandson Noah received his understandingof medicine from a book of knowledge given to him by the archangelRaphael. Itwas a book that had been concealed in a cave since the time of Adam. Enoch readit there and learned the art of astronomy, while Noah found in it advice onconstructing the Ark. Another tradition relates how the angelRaziel communi-cated to Noah a secret book containing the art of astrology, which was thenwritten on a sapphire that Noah kept in a golden chest that he brought with himin the Ark. This was subsequently inherited by his son Shem. A survivingastrological tract called theTreatise of Shemdates to sometime in the lateWrstcenturybceor earlyce.2Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"So, according to this biblical chronology, the earliest works on the occultsciences were those studied by Enoch. TheWrst book of conjuration and magic,though, is associated with Noah’s sons Shem and Ham (Cham in Latin). Historiesof the lives of Noah’s sons outside the Old Testament were mutable and some-times conXicting. In some accounts Ham wrote down the secrets of his demonicmagic on metal plates and stone tablets before the Flood, buried them, and thenreturned to them once the waters had subsided. Others, such as theWrst Bishop ofNorwich (d.1119), thought his magic book was secreted in the Ark: ‘the ark wasof small compass; but yet even there Ham preserved the arts of magic andidolatry.’ In some medieval texts Zoroaster is the son of Ham and in others heisHam. According to the twelfth-century scholar Michael Scot, in his history ofastrology and astronomy, Zoroaster was the inventor of magic, but he wasdescended from Shem, and it was Ham who invented the art of divination withthe help of demons. Ham then taught it to his son Canaan who wrote down thesecrets of the art in thirty volumes, which were burned after he was killed in battle.As to the lasting heritage of Noah’s sons, one commentary recorded the belief thatJaphet was the father of all Europeans, Shem the heir to Africa, while the paganpeoples of Asia, and tellingly, the Egyptians, descended from Ham.3Although Persia was seen as the source of magic, the people of the ancientcivilization of Chaldea, part of Babylonia, were also renowned for their astro-logical and magical abilities. Zoroaster was sometimes referred to as a Chaldean. Inarchaeological terms too, the Sumerian-inspired cuneiform writing of theAkkadians, one of the peoples of the Mesopotamian region, represent theWrstmajor repository of written magic spells and conjurations, though their secretswere only deciphered in the nineteenth century. In Uruk, one of the world’searliest cities, and now part of Iraq, excavations of houses dating from theWfth andfourth centuriesbceturned up cuneiform clay tablets containing a series of magicrituals and incantations. They were, it seems, the private libraries of well-knownscribes and exorcists.4By the birth of Christ, though, it was the later civilization ofEgypt that was seen by Greeks,Romans, Christians, Jews, and later Muslims, asthe centre of magic and the home of the most adept magician priests. According tothe Jewish Talmud, nine-tenths of the world’s sorcery resided in Egypt.5It wasthe place of pilgrimage for all those who desired to learn the magical arts. It wasbelieved in later antiquity that even famous Greek philosophers such as Plato andPythagoras had been instructed in wisdom and occult knowledge by Egyptianpriests. Centuries after his death, those who subscribed to the teachings ofPythagoras continued to be suspected of dabbling in magic.6Most of the earlyphysical evidence for ancient Egyptian magic derives from burial goods, amulets,stone monuments, and inscriptions on metal and clay tablets and bowls. Theyremind us that we should not think of literary magic only in terms of the written8|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"page. While books were principally used as records, the power of written wordswas eVected through their transcription on to ritual or protective objects.TheWrst identiWable phase in the development of the grimoire occurred duringthe Hellenistic period, when Egypt was under Greek rule for three hundred yearsfollowing Alexander the Great’s conquest of the country in332 bceThis was afertile period of cultural and religious exchange, with the Egyptian priesthoodlearning and using Greek and the Greeks imbibing Egyptian religion and magic.One result of this fusion was the founding of the great Library of Alexandria,which attracted scholars from all over the Greek world. Another was the Copticwriting system constructed from the Greek alphabet and Egyptian phonetics.More to the point, thanks to the amazing nineteenth-century archaeologicaldiscoveries of what are known as the Graeco-Egyptian papyri, we can see howthe magic tradition that would later spread across Europe was largely a product ofcultural exchange in Hellenistic Egypt. These papyri date from the lateWrstcenturybceto theWfth centuryce, thus mostly from the period ofRoman rule,and are written in Greek, Demotic Egyptian, and Coptic rather than the hiero-glyphic magic associated with Egyptian temples and burial monuments. Theycontain a fascinating mix of Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish religious inXuences, andthere is considerable debate about how much and which of the spells andconjurations are truly Egyptian in origin. There are distinct diVerences betweenthe magic they contain and that found in the earliest magical inscriptions andpapyri from the time of the pharaohs. While the latter are primarily concernedwith health and protection, the Graeco-Egyptian papyri manuscripts are muchmore focused on the desires and ambitions of the magician, with magic used forWnancial gain, social success, and sexual conquest. The summoning of visions ofdeities to impart occult knowledge or divine the future was also a major com-ponent of the ritual magic of the later period.7In biblical chronology Moses is calculated by theological scholars to have livedsometime between theWfteenth and thirteenth centurybce—long after the Flood.This prophet, miracle worker, and leader of the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt hadan eventful life by all accounts, but there are two episodes that bear directly on thegrimoire tradition. TheWrst was his and Aaron’s titanic magic contest against thePharaoh’s wizards, during which, as told in Exodus, he turned the rivers and poolsof Egypt into blood and summoned up a plague ofXies. The second was hisreception of the Torah and the two tablets bearing the Ten Commandmentsduring his revelation on Mount Sinai. The former sealed the tradition of Mosesthe magician while the latter was the source of myths regarding the divinetransmission of more secret knowledge than is mentioned in the Torah and OldTestament.Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"According to the New Testament (Acts7:22) ‘Moses was learned in all thewisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.’ In an Egyptiancontext, wisdom was taken in antiquity to mean occult knowledge and thiscomment represents a more general belief at the time that Moses had learnedthe art of magic during his time in Egypt—he was after all born there and broughtup in Pharaoh’s household. The Greek pagan Celsus, writing in the secondcenturyce, asserted that the Jews were much addicted to the sorcery taughtthem by Moses. It was certainly the case that by the time of Jesus their reputationas magicians had grown to a similar level to that of the Egyptians. DuringRomanrule there is evidence of Jewish magicians being sought out, and they could befound in the entourage of highRoman oYcials. Jewish elements can also be foundin numerous charms in the Graeco-Egyptian papyri.8It was, however, fundamental to the identity of Jewish religion, and importantto Christianity, that a clear distinction was made between the ‘portents andmiracles’ of Moses and the ‘sorcery’ of Egyptian wizards. The gods worshippedby the latter, and the assistance they sought from ‘corrupt angels’ and demons,were vanquished by the superior powers of the one God acting through Moses. Inthe process clear water was put between the cultures of Judaism and Egypt, both ofwhich were represented in the life of Moses.9Yet from the late medieval periodonwards, Christian occult philosophers, mystics, and magicians began to redeWneMoses as an Egyptian rather than a Jew, presenting him as a repository of Egyptianwisdom and magic. Later he would come to be seen as a great African wonder-worker in African-American popular religion.10Moses meant many things tomany people.The Jewish Torah, or Pentateuch as Christians refer to theWve scrolls or booksthat make up theWrst part of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,Numbers, Deuteronomy), was dictated to Moses by God. But did he receivemore wisdom than the Jewish and Christian priests revealed? Over the millenniamany people have certainly thought so. Two surviving magic papyri from aroundthe fourth centuryceare entitled the ‘hidden book of Moses called ‘‘eight’’ or‘‘holy’’ ’, and ‘Unique or Eighth Book of Moses’. They mention other lost Mosaictexts, namely theKey of Moses, Archangelical Teaching of Moses, Secret Moon Book ofMoses, andTenth Hidden [Book of] Moses.11TheEighth Book of Mosesprovides ritualfor meeting the gods and instructs:Now when the god comes in do not starejat his face, but look at his feetwhile beseeching him, as written above, and giving thanks that he did nottreat you contemptuously, but you were thought worthy of the thingsabout to be said to you for correction of your life.

We only know about theEighth Bookfrom the archaeological discovery and translation of the papyri in thenineteenth and twentieth centuries. Yet, intriguingly, by the late eighteenth cen-tury a manuscript claiming to be theSixthandSeventh Books of Moseswascirculating in Germany. Whoever wrote it would have been unaware of theexistence of a purportedEighth Book, but was no doubt conscious of rumours andclaims of the discovery of other lost Mosaic texts. In1725, for instance, a book wasprinted in Cologne claiming to contain ‘the newly found books of secrets ofMoses’.13Three centuries earlier, manuscripts of simple, practical magical receiptswritten in a mix of Hebrew, Aramaic, and gibberish, were circulating in Europebearing the title theHarba de-MoshaorSword of Moses, though a work of the samename was known as early as the eleventh century. One version provided a spell forhow to walk on water without getting one’s feet wet, allowing the magician tomimic a miracle attributed to Jesus.14As we shall see later in the book, though, itwas theSixthandSeventh Books of Mosesthat would have the greatest inXuence onthe modern world of magic and religion.Hermes Trismegistus was the other centralWgure in historic conceptions ofancient Egyptian magic, and the next great reputed author of occult books in thissurvey of the dubious lineage of magic. In his most mythical guise he was aconXation of Thoth, the ibis-headed Egyptian god of Wisdom, and the Greek godHermes (equated with theRoman Mercury). Thoth was thought to be theinventor of writing and mathematics and therefore the patron God of scribesand administrators. As the founder of the written word it stood to reason he wasalso a supreme master of magic. His merging with Hermes took place during theHellenistic period and the result, Hermes Trismegistus the ‘thrice great’, was, asone historian has remarked, ‘more than the sum of his parts’.15But we need to becareful not to present this version of Hermes as being the only one. In an Islamictradition dating to at least the ninth century there are three people identiWed asHermes. TheWrst was Enoch/Idris, the founder of astrology who, by carvinghis occult scientiWc knowledge on a temple, preserved the wisdom of theantediluvian world for future mankind. The second lived in Egypt or Chaldeaafter the Flood and taught Pythagoras, and the third was a great physician who livedAncient and Medieval Grimoires|11"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"in Egypt and wrote books on alchemy and poisonous animals. In some accounts hewas also a contemporary of Moses.16Disentangling the various identities whenreading ancient and medieval references to Hermes is not an easy task.The third-centurybceEgyptian historian and priest Manetho reckoned therewere an impressive36,525books of Hermes. Several centuries after his deathManetho was given the spurious authorship of one of these, theBook of Sothis,which was essentially a chronicle of Egyptian Kings purportedly inscribed insacred characters by Trismegistus before the Flood.17Another estimate from thesame era mentioned the more modest number of20,000works, others mere tensand hundreds rather than thousands.18Several surviving medieval and earlymodern Hermetic occult texts were purportedly copies of works by anotherancient mage named Toc or Toz Graecus (Toz the Greek). A work attributedto him on the creation of magical images, rings, and mirrors through the divineinXuence of Venus was described as an ‘evil book’ by one medieval scholar. As tothe background of Toz Graecus, as one variant spelling of his name ‘Thot’suggests, he may have been one and the same as Hermes Trismegistus, but bythe medieval period confusion had arisen and a separate identity created. In somelater grimoires, however, he was sometimes referred to as Ptolomaeus Graeccusand described as a disciple of Solomon. As a seventeenth-century Latin grimoireentitled ‘A commentary by Toz Graecus, philosopher of great name’ explained, itscontents were the summation of all Solomon’s knowledge, which he wrote downin a book for his sonRehoboam, who buried it in his tomb in an ivory casket.When Toz discovered it he wept with frustration at his inability to understand it,until an angel revealed its secrets to him.19What was this fabled book?The Solomon we are talking about, of course, is the Old Testament King, theson of David, who completed his father’s work of building the Holy Temple inJerusalem in which the Ark of the Covenant was housed. In biblical chronology itis calculated that he ruled Israel during the tenth centurybce. The account of himin the Old Testament refers to his wisdom as being ‘greater than all the wisdom ofEgypt’. He was the source of3,000proverbs and over a thousand songs, and knewthe secrets of plants and animals better than any man. There is no biblicalintimation of Solomon as being a great magician, but his reputation for astrologyand knowledge of the spirit world seems to have circulated in the Near East andEgypt by the second centurybce. It is theWrst-century Jewish historian Josephuswho presents us with theWrst clear representation of Solomon the magician,telling how Solomon had written3,000books including ones containing incan-tations and exorcisms to heal demon-induced sickness. TheWrst actual magicbook attributed to him, theTestament of Solomon, was written in Greek sometimeduring theWrstWve centuriesceand probably originated in Babylonia or Egypt.20The earliest surviving papyri excerpts from it date to the latter end of this period.12|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"There is no evidence, as some scholars have suggested, that the Greek versionborrowed from an earlier Jewish Solomonic book of magic. It was only centurieslater that copies appeared in Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin.TheTestamentis essentially a tale of how demons hampered the construction ofthe Temple by plaguing Solomon’s favourite workman. Heeding Solomon’sprayers for help, the angel Michael presented to him a magical ring from God.Engraved upon it was the Seal of Solomon that had the power to bind demons,and was depicted in later grimoires as variously a pentagram, hexagram, or circularsymbol, while inRussia it was associated with the SATORAREPO wordsquare.21The latter was a magic palindrome, examples of which have beenfound dating back toRoman times, including amongst the ruins of Pompeii. Itwas usually written as follows:SATORAREPOTENETOPERAROTASNumerous translations have been proposed to explain its meaning, but none areentirely satisfactory. The fact that the letters were also reformulated to spellPATERNOSTERtwice, arranged in the form of a cross, might suggest it wasof Christian origin. In several medieval Near Eastern churches one or more of thewords in the square were given to the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus.22Through the power of the ring, thirty-six or more demons were compelled toappear and identify themselves to Solomon, telling him their evil powers, andhow they could be controlled by writing down certain words. So the demonAutothithstated that he caused grudges andWghting but could be banished bywriting down ‘Alpha’ and ‘Omega’, the First and the Last. The dirty swineAgchonioˆnexplained that he lay among the swaddling-clothes of babies causingmischief. HeXed when a diminishing form of the word ‘Lycurgos’ was written onaWg leaf: ‘Lycurgos, ycurgos, curgos, yrgos, gos, os’. Armed with this knowledge,Solomon sealed some of the demons up in vessels like genies in a bottle, whileothers were put to work building the temple using their superhuman powers tospeed up the work. Solomon lost his divinely bestowed power after becomingbesotted by a foreign woman. He was told by the priests of her land that he couldnot sleep with her until he had made a sacriWce to the god Moloch. This he didand subsequently committed further idolatry by building temples to two othergods, Baal andRapha. TheTestamentends with Solomon saying he wrote downhis account for the beneWt of others who might be inspired and aided by hisAncient and Medieval Grimoires|13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"knowledge, but warned oVthe path to his own ultimate downfall, ‘So that youmayWnd grace forever and ever.’23There is no doubt theTestamentwas used as a grimoire rather than merely readas a cautionary religious or mystical text. A medieval version in the British Libraryincludes additional annotations by its owner to supplement and facilitate its use forperforming exorcisms.24The list of demons and their powers would become astaple of later grimoires. During the medieval period other magic texts ascribed toSolomon also began to appear. The renowned thirteenth-century scientist andfriar Albertus Magnus of Cologne noted thatWve necromantic books ascribed toSolomon were circulating at the time.25One of them with a long shelf life was theAlmandal, surviving examples of which in German and Latin date to theWfteenthcentury. The title of this straightforward guide to the ritual invocation of angelsrefers to an Arabic word for a wax tablet altar on which the magician engravesdivine names and the seals of Solomon with a silver stylus. To heighten theanticipation of the reader, and to ensure the magician knew they had conjuredup the correct celestial visitor, descriptions were provided of how the angelswould appear. The angel of the second altitude revealed himself as a three-year-old child in a radiant red garment, face, and hands blood red with theWre of divinelove, wearing a crown of wild roses. The angelic encounter would clear the mindof the magician, he would be overwhelmed by love and aVection, and humbledby the angel’s assurances of redemptive friendship.26Despite being condemned by some medieval commentators theArs NotoriaorNotary Artswas another similarly benign Solomonic work rather than a demonicgrimoire.27Its rationale was based on a passage in2Chronicles in the OldTestament where Solomon asks God:Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come inbefore this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? AndGod said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast notasked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yethast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, thatthou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches,and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that havebeen before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.Surviving early copies, of which overWfty exist for the period1300–1600, containprayers with words purporting to be Chaldean, along with Greek and Hebrew,and various occult signs and geometricWgures revealed to Solomon by an angel ashe prayed one night. Through employing these in conjunction with puriWcationrituals, the magician, like Solomon, could request the angels, saints, Christ even,14|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"to bestow divine knowledge regarding the seven liberal arts of medieval educa-tion—namely grammar, rhetoric, and logic (the verbal arts), and arithmetic,music, geometry, and astronomy (the mathematical arts).28TheArs Notoriaalsoheld out the prospect of experiencing ecstatic visions, and obtaining fast-trackmeans of becoming an adept in science and learning languages. Those who used itwere not inspired by greed or the manipulation of others for money, politicalpower, and sex. It was theWrst Solomonic text to be put into print, with a Latinedition appearing around1600, though it did not contain thenotaeor occult signsandWgures found in the earlier manuscripts.The most enduring, inXuential, and notorious Solomonic book, theClaviculaSalomonisor theClaviculeorKey of Solomon, was a true grimoire. The earliestversions of the text were written in Greek in theWfteenth century and bore thetitlesMagical Treatise of Solomonor theLittle Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy,Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon. By the time they weretranslated into Latin and Italian in the following century the termClaviculawasbeing used. Although some manuscripts again claimed that they were translationsfrom Hebrew there is no substantive evidence for a Hebrew version before theseventeenth century.29There is no one deWnitive version of theClaviculebut,along with conjurations to command and control the ‘Angels of Darkness’,manuscripts usually contained rituals and symbols for personal rather than spiritualwell being, such as to provoke love, punish enemies, become invisible, and dealwith thieves. We shall encounter its use again and again in the next chapter.The New Testament, while rich in miracles, exorcisms, and magic, did notprovide any notable future grimoire authors. Yet there are twoWgures from theGospels and the Acts of the Apostles that had the potential to join Enoch, Moses,and Solomon. One was Simon Magus and the other Jesus. We are introduced tothe former, a Samaritan, in Acts8where it is written:But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the samecity used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out thathimself was some great one: To whom they all gave heed, from the leastto the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. And to himthey had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them withsorceries.This is an extract from the King James edition of the New Testament, produced inthe early seventeenth century, and interpreting the references to magic, witch-craft, and sorcery it contains is fraught with problems due to the distortions ofincorrect and imprecise translation. Furthermore, the choice of words was shapedby the conceptions and perceptions of the translators. The use of the term ‘witch’Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|15"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and ‘witchcraft’ in early modern vernacular Bibles provided an important justiW-cation for the witch trials. Yet the meaning of the original Greek words usuallyreferred to diviners and poisoners rather than people who performedmaleWciumorharmful acts of magic to kill, injure, or ruin their neighbours and their goods,which is how witchcraft was usually deWned in the early modern period. Likewiseit has been suggested that poor translation generated an inaccurate portrayal ofSimon as a base magician.30Over the next four centuries after Jesus’ death, Christian propagandists furtherbesmirched Simon Magus’s reputation. It was said he used semen and menstrualblood in his incantations. The second-century sect known as the SimonianGnostics, which was believed to have been founded by Simon Magus, wasdenounced as being addicted to magic. By the fourth andWfth centuries he wasno longer just a magician and Gnostic but was being denounced as the father of allheresies.31A host of apocryphal accounts of Simon Magus circulated in medievalEurope, such as his demonic ability toXy, his conjuring up of vicious dogs toattack the apostle Simon Peter, and his ability to render himself invisible.32Medieval Irish legends tell of the druid MogRuith who, along with his daughter,travelled to the Middle East to learn magic from Simon Magus. His apprenticeshiplasted between six and thirty-three years, and one of the great feats he learned wasthat ofXying using a magic wheel, which he used to attack the apostles. In onelegend it was MogRuith, carrying on the diabolic work of his master, whobeheaded John the Baptist.33The portrayal of Simon Magus served the purpose of creating the antithesis ofJesus. Both were seen as miracle workers in their own lifetimes. Some Jewish andpagan critics dismissed Jesus as a magician, a necromancer even, just as Christianslater dismissed Simon Magus. The pagan author Celsus argued that Jesus hadvisited Egypt to learn magic.34Jesus’ feats were not as showy as the apocryphalones of Simon Magus, or Moses for that matter, but he nevertheless performed themechanics of practical magic if not the ritualistic aspects of it. He cured merely byuttering words such as ‘arise’ and ‘be clean’, and applied saliva to cure the deaf andblind. He cast out demons. His initial fame rested on these activities. Yet Jesus’motives are portrayed as pure and his miracles eVected through faith, whereasSimon Magus, as the archetypal magician, was arrogant, sinful, vain, motivated bybase desires, and his magic all artiWce and demonic. There is evidence, neverthe-less, that care was taken about how and which of Jesus’ miracles were included inthe New Testament, particularly in Matthew, so as not to present them as magicalin comparison with the healing magic practised at the time.35The authors of theNew Testament also performed a more subtle balancing act in comparing Jesuswith King Solomon. In light of the appearance of Christ, the reputation ofSolomon as the wisest man ever and forever needed qualifying. So Jesus is also16|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"referred to as the ‘son of David’, and the emphasis on Jesus the healer and casterout of demons demonstrated that he was not a second-rate Solomon.36In the Bible and the apocrypha neither Jesus nor Simon Magus are particularlyassociated withwrittensources of occult knowledge and wisdom, in contrast withEnoch, Moses, and Solomon. There are no stories of how secret books wereburied, hidden, or handed down for future generations. This is one reason whygrimoire traditions did not accrue around them over the centuries. There aremore obvious reasons why Jesus remained untainted of course, blasphemy andheresy being two, but considering the reputation of Simon Magus in the medievalperiod it is still surprising that he was not widely associated with grimoires. TheinXuential German abbot, occultist, and bibliophile Trithemius (1462–1516), whowe shall meet again in the next chapter, apparently owned a magic book called theBook of Simon the Magician, which presumably referred to Magus.37A Hebrewmanuscript entitled theBook of the Key of Solomon(Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh),which dates to no earlier than the late seventeenth or eighteenth century and wasprobably translated from Italian, contains a Satanic conjuration called ‘The Op-eration of Simon Magus’. It instructs that the magician stand in the middle of amagical circle, and say three times, neither more nor less, these words:I adjure you, O Lucifer, and all thy associates, by the Living God, by theAngels above and below, by So and So, and in the name of A and B, &c.;I furthermore adjure you by Belzebuk, your Lord; I moreover adjure youby Satan, in whose hands are the Keys of Gehinnom. I adjure you byLucifer, your King; I adjure you by the mighty deep; I adjure you by theLaw of the Lord, that you shall have no power to stand in the air, norbeneath the air; nor on the earth, or beneath the earth; nor in the water,or under the water; nor in the heavens, or beneath the heavens; nor in anyplace of the world; but that thou shalt come forthwith unto this place,thou, O Lucifer, with thy associates, or that thou shalt send three of thyservants, who shall tell me the truth concerning all that I shall inquire ofthem, in the name of AGLA, AGLAJI, AGLTA, AGLAUT, AGLTUN,and in the name of ALPHA, V, HE, VJV, JUD, HE, MAHL, ALIHAI,ELOKIM, ZEBAOTH, ELYON, &c.38But the fact that we shall hardly mention him again in the rest of our journeyconWrms that his reputation had a minimal inXuence in the history of literarymagic. Grimoire authorship was generally associated withWgures known for theirwisdom, knowledge, or Christian piety, even if the latter was achieved throughthe renunciation of prior sinful magical practices. In this context a Magus grimoirewas a contradiction in terms for it could only be a work of evil, and thereforeAncient and Medieval Grimoires|17"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"indefensible by those magicians who believed they were acknowledging the gloryof God through their rituals and invocations.Burning booksIt is obviously a matter of religious belief whether Hermes, Ham, Zoroaster,Solomon, or Moses existed or performed miracles let alone received and wrotebooks. What is certain is that by the fourth centurybcebooks of spells and charmswritten on papyrus were being produced.39It was papyrus, made from the pith ofthe wetland plant of the Nile Delta, that enabled the production of books, if wedeWne a book as a portable series of written leaves or sheets joined together—which certainly does not apply to clay, wooden, or stone tablets. Papyrus booksconsisted of glued sheets, sometimes up to tens of feet in length, which were rolledaround a rod.40Writing on papyrus required the use of inks, and this led to newmagical notions based on their constituents. Ink containing myrrh, a resinousplant sap, was speciWed for some charms, for instance, and blood was sometimesintermingled, as in a dream spell that required the blood of a baboon, the sacredanimal of Thoth-Hermes.41The one signiWcant disadvantage of papyrus was thatit wasXammable.By the early years of Christianity numerous such magic books or rolls were incirculation in the eastern Mediterranean amongst Jews, pagans, and Christians.We have archaeological evidence for this as represented by the Graeco-Egyptianand Coptic papyri. They were evidently suYciently inXuential for the earlyChurch to launch a series of campaigns against grimoires and other occultliterature. Magic was explicitly associated with paganism, and in the struggle forreligious and political dominance the Church saw magic books as sources ofreligious corruption that tarnished Christians and hampered the conversion ofpagans. The Church was by no means a trendsetter in burning books in the nameof religion. The paganRoman authorities had kept a close eye on undesirableliterature that threatened state control of religious worship.Their primary concern was the practice of divination, which also had politicaland military implications. In186 bce, for instance, the senate requested theRoman magistrates to round up and burn books of soothsaying. Over a centuryand a half later2,000books of divination were said to have burned on the orders ofEmperor Augustus. Some religious and philosophical works fared no better. In181 bcea buried chest of books purporting to be the work of Pythagoras wereturned to ashes on the orders of the senate. Further east, Antiochus Epiphanes,king of the Seleucid Empire, which was a relic of Alexander the Great’s conquestthat stretched from Turkey to Turkmenistan at its height, ordered the seizure and18|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"burning of Jewish religious texts in168 bce. Christians were also the target ofimperial suppression, with theRoman Emperor Diocletian’s edict of303 ceordering the destruction of all copies of the Scriptures.42But it is the Church that most determinedly went after magic books. The mostwell-known and earliest case concerns St Paul’s conversion of the Ephesians toChristianity. As related in Acts19, many of the Jews and Greeks of Ephesus, a citynow in Turkey, famous for its Temple of the goddess Artemis, ‘used curious arts[and] brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and theycounted the price of them, and found itWfty thousand pieces of silver.’ Ephesushad a reputation as a centre of magic in the Hellenistic andRoman world, and thetermEphesia grammata(Ephesian letters) was given to mysterious non-Greek andnon-Latin words, supposedly engraved on the statue of Artemis, which werethought to have ‘evil-averting’ magical properties and were used in magic in-scriptions and curse tablets.43A silver piece or drachma was equivalent of a day’swages at the time so, whether the New Testament story is factual, the intention wasto show the value placed on the magic books in circulation in the city. Some Biblescholars have suggested that those who handed over their magic books were newlyconverted Christians destroying the last vestige of their old religion, though thedominant interpretation is that it was Jews and pagans who handed them over as anact of conversion to the new faith. Either way the sheer number of books involved,if the details are to be believed, suggest that grimoires were not only in thepossession of the professional magicians and healers but were kept in many homes.44Saint John of Chrysostom, the late-fourth-century archbishop of Constantin-ople, recalled how one day during his childhood in Antioch, an important city andearly home of Christianity in Anatolia (part of modern Turkey), he witnessedsoldiers launch a dragnet for books of sorcery and magic. One magician wascaptured but before his arrest managed toXing his unbound manuscript into ariver. While on their way to church John and a friend saw somethingXoating inthe water which they atWrst thought was a linen cloth. On closer inspection theyrealized it was a book andWshed it out, only toWnd to their horror that itcontained magic.There were we congealed with fear. For who would have believed ourstory that we had picked it up from the river, when all were at that time,even the unsuspected, under strict watch? And we did not dare to cast itaway, lest we should be seen, and there was a like danger to us in tearing itto pieces. God gave us means, and we cast it away, and at last we were freefor that time from the extreme peril.45Such round-ups were evidently unsuccessful. A severe campaign against pagans inthe city launched in the mid-sixth century turned up more magic books. TheyAncient and Medieval Grimoires|19"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"were still being used by pagans in the countryside as well. In the life of SaintTheodore (d.613) of Galatia, Anatolia, there is an account of an unbaptized villagemagician who owned magic books that he used to deal with spirits and conjure upclouds of locusts for a fee.46In mid-Wfth-century Egypt, Shenoute, the abbot ofthe Coptic White Monastery in the Theban desert, instituted a ruthless policy ofdestroying the signs of pagan worship. When he and his followers vandalized theshrine of a local notable they found and burned a library of sacred texts thatShenoute believed also contained magic books, and they likewise destroyed thelibrary of a group of idol worshippers in the village of Pneuit.47It was clear to the Church authorities, though, that magic was not just a paganproblem, even if magic was deemed pagan. In the480s the Church in Beirutlaunched an investigation into magic being practised by law students in the city.At the centre of the allegations was a Christian from Thebes named JohnFoulon.48While in Beirut he had become infatuated with a chaste woman whoresisted his attempts at wooing. Together with several fellow students, he decidedto use magic to call up a demon by sacriWcing an Ethiopian slave he owned. Theywere found out before they could complete the ceremony and the slave reportedhis master’s actions. When John’s house was searched several grimoires werefound in a box hidden under a seat. One of the investigators, Zacariah ofMytilene, later described how: ‘In the books were certain drawings of perversedaimones, barbaric names, and harmful, presumptuous commands replete witharrogance and quiteWt for perversedaimones. Certain of the incantations wereattributed to Zoroaster themagus, others to Ostanes the magician, others yet toManetho.’ Foulon confessed and blamed the student ethos in the city for hisdescent into magic, naming several other students of his acquaintance whopractised the art. AWre was then lit and he cast his books into it. Not long after,some of those on the list, including pagans, were caught. One of them namedGeorge of Thessalonike was reported after asking a scribe to make a copy of hisgrimoire. As Zacariah recalled, ‘the entire city was in a state of uproar because [thestudents] were spending their time studying magic books instead of applyingthemselves to law.’ As well as this town-and-gown tension there was alsoWghtingin the streets as one of the suspected magicians, a pagan, drafted in some roughs todisrupt the house searches being conducted by the authorities. These tacticsseemed to be partially successful for grimoires were found in only two homesincluding George’s. Once the street violence had died down the magic bookswere publicly burned in a great bonWre in one of the city’s public squares.As various ordinances, edicts, and laws show, the Church had concerns that notonlyWckle students but its own priests were prone to being led astray. A Churchcanon issued in Alexandria, perhaps during the late fourth or earlyWfth century,ordered that clergy hand over to the civil authorities any of their sons found20|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"studying books of magic.49It was in this period,386to be precise, that a Spanishbishop, Priscillian of Avila, was condemned to death for allegedly practisingsorcery and consorting with depraved women in nocturnal revels. The followingcentury a group of bishops investigated the activities of some suspected heretics inTarragona, Spain, amongst them a wealthy priest named Severus, who possessedthree large magic books. He had been travelling to one of his estates when he wasambushed by robbers. They took his books and intended to sell them in the townof Ilerda, but fearing they were heretical handed them over to the town’s bishop,Sagittius. He kept two for himself and sent the other to his superior after cuttingout those sections ‘which contained the shameful and sacrilegious learning ofmagical spells’. Severus was brought before his bishop Syagrius for questioning.He claimed that the books had belonged to his late mother and he knew nothingof their contents. This rather lame excuse convinced Syagrius, who returned thebook in his possession, and Severus subsequently bought back the other twovolumes from Sagittius. At this point a monk named Fronto stepped in to accuseSeverus and a female relative of heresy. It all got very messy with Fronto organizinga lynch mob at one point. A council of seven bishops was convened and theydecided to snuVout the case before it became even more of an embarrassment. Thethree magic books were burned, and when Fronto protested about the terminationof the investigation he was beaten senseless by one of the bishops.50Over the next few centuries Church authorities from across the Christianworld issued repeated warnings. In694, for instance, the Council of Toledoissued an edict stating ‘it is not permitted for altar ministers or for clerics tobecome magicians or sorcerers, or to make charms, which are great bindings onsouls. And we declare that those who practise this will be ejected from theChurch.’51Edicts and canons piled up as the Church pushed its boundariesnorthwards to the pagan lands of Scandinavia and the eastern Baltic, and theyincreasingly focused on the laity rather than the clergy. By the end of themillennium, with Christianity having been the sole religion across much ofEurope for several centuries, paganism and its ambivalent demons of the naturalworld had long ceased to be relevant. In their stead demonic fallen angels and theirruler Satan increasingly came to be associated with magic and its practitioners.New enemies of Christ were formed and in the process many more books weredestined to burn in the age of Inquisitions.The medieval mixWhile the Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it nevermanaged to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religiousAncient and Medieval Grimoires|21"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"devotion and magic. The medical manuals known as leechbooks, which wereproduced by the clergy or monastic communities of late Anglo-Saxon England,are a good example. They were based principally on classical medicine but alsocontained spells for healing and protection. How else was one to deal withmalicious elves for instance?52Some of the charms were Christianized versionsof pagan healing verses. While most of the spells included in these medicalmanuscripts were enacted orally, in other words their written form served onlyas a record, textual amulets were clearly an integral part of tenth- and eleventh-century medicine as practised by clergy and literate lay folk. They consisted ofexorcisms and prayers asking for help and protection, sometimes interspersed withmagical holy names in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Apocryphal celestial letterspurporting to be messages sent from God and delivered in writing by angels werealso popular.53This is just the sort of material that made up a lot of the content ofthe grimoires denounced by the clergy. It was the context in which they wererecorded and used, and by whom, that determined whether they were consideredacts of sinful magic or pious devotion. For the common people such distinctionswere largely irrelevant.To further complicate things, not all magic was condemned outright by alltheologians. While magic had only negative connotations for some, a clearintellectual division developed during the medieval period between naturalmagic and demonic magic or necromancy. Natural magic rested on the premisethat interconnecting hidden or occult natural forces existed in God’s universe thatcould be tapped by humans. So plants, animals, and precious stones, for instance,were composed of compounds and substances that could and did have curativeand protective properties, but some were also imbued with hidden essences andpowers inXuenced and activated by other unseen forces such as astral emanationsfrom stars and planets. The occult properties of some plants and animals wereencoded in their appearance. God had given them a signature identifying thesympathy they had with other living things. So the mandrake root, which had aroughly humanoid shape, was invested with human sentience. It was thought thatit screamed and cried when pulled out of the ground, cursing those who disturbedit. A particularly contentious area of natural magic concerned the possibility thathumans and their souls could inXuence others. Could women harm people bymerely looking at them? Could thoughts and desires be projected?54These wereall ancient conceptions, but in the medieval period the boundaries of naturalmagic were renegotiated, and justiWcations had to be found if those magicalproperties deemed natural were not to be confused with demonic magic andcondemned as anti-Christian.If magic was not natural then it was either fraudulent pretence, illusion,or enacted through the power of demons. In the medieval period the term22|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"necromancy, originally a means of divination by summoning the dead, began tobe used to describe such demon conjuring. This came about because of thetheological view that the raising of the dead was a divine miracle beyond humaninXuence. The supposed spirits of the dead who appeared to the magicians ofantiquity and the Bible were in reality demons in disguise. Similarly, those medievalmagicians who practised what they believed to be the pious act of ritually contactingangels were accused of vanity and much more. The very act of conjuration was anopen invitation to demonic gatecrashers. Magicians had no control over the spiritworld and believing they could do so through magic was a denial of God’s omnipo-tence. The word ‘nigromancy’ also appears in medieval documents. This was avariant spelling of necromancy, but it came to haveitsown meaning as ‘black magic’.As written magic developed in Europe new traditions developed in relation tothe use of parchment. Papyrus was not a native plant in Europe of course and rollswere expensive to import. So as we know fromRoman archaeology, bark, andwooden and wax tablets were commonly used as portable writing surfaces.Ritualcurses and spells deposited at shrines were also incised on metal sheets, whileephemeral charms were created by writing on plant leaves. Parchment, which isthinly stretched animal skin, usually from sheep, goats, and calves, was alreadyused for writing in the Near East during the third centurybceand began to beincreasingly adopted in the Mediterranean world a couple of centuries later. It wasmoreXexible and durable than papyrus and both sides could be written on. Pagescould be stitched together to make books, which were easier to consult than rolledup scrolls.Religious considerations also shaped how parchment was used andconceived. It was never adopted in Hindu and Buddhist Asia where the idea ofusing butchered animals was oVensive. Jewish religious laws regarding clean andunclean animals also dictated that parchment for ritual purposes was not to bemade from the likes of camel, pig, and hare. From at least the medieval periodonwards deerskin parchment would come to be preferred for Jewish amulets.55Christians did not share these concerns and restrictions and the parchment bookbecame the medium through which the Bible spread across Europe. It was onlysuperseded by paper made from linen rags in theWfteenth century, a transitionsealed by the rise of printing. Still, parchment retained its special status for use indrawing up legal charters and religious documents, and in magical practice.Medieval grimoires sometimes speciWed that virgin or unborn parchmentshould be used for making copies and writing out amulets. The former wasmade from animals that had not yet reached sexual maturity, while unbornparchment was made from the amniotic sac of aborted animal foetuses. Thereason for their use was to ensure the purity of the grimoire or charm; in eVectit was an act of sympathetic magic that cleansed the written word from theimpurity of thought or action of the magician. It was sometimes speciWed thatAncient and Medieval Grimoires|23"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the magician should personally induce the abortion or cut out the uterus fromdead animals to ensure that no external agencies contaminated the process. Theuse of ink consecrated by a priest further enhanced the act of writing magic. In theage of paper this ritual rationale meant that right into the modern period somemagicians continued to use parchment to make manuscript grimoires and amuletseven when paper was a much cheaper option.The magic of theWrst millennium, as we know it from surviving written texts,was primarily a mix of Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Jewish inXuences.Medieval grimoires reXect this, but new traditions also developed as scholarsand theologians reconceptualized and reconstructed, sometimes falsely, the cul-tures, philosophies, and beliefs of the ancient world. While the magical reputa-tions of the likes of Pythagoras were based on well-worn accusations levelled backin antiquity, other great intellectualWgures of the distant past became the subjectof new medieval legends—no one more so than theRoman poet Virgil (70–19bce). Why he came to generate so many tales of conjuring capers in the medievalperiod is diYcult to fathom. He was said to have built an enchanted palace inRome, carried oVthe daughter of a Babylonian Sultan, and founded a school ofmagic in Naples. As to the source of his powers, one legend stated that he obtainedthem from a book found beneath the head of the fabled Greek centaur Chiron.Gervase of Tilbury, writing in the early thirteenth century, related that anEnglishman had gone to Naples to excavate Virgil’s grave. His body was foundperfectly preserved and under his head were books including theArs Notoria.Other medieval tales tell how he possessed Solomon’s book of necromancy or thatof one Zabulon, a Greek or Babylonian prince who had invented necromancyand astrology1,200years before Christ.56Virgil’s magical reputation would spreadfurther during the early sixteenth century when popular books recounting hisfeats of ‘witchcraft and negromancye’ were printed, and in Naples legends ofVirgil as a magician continued to circulate into the eighteenth century.57It is nowonder, then, that Virgilian grimoires circulated in the early modern period.The Greek-Egyptian astronomer and geographer Ptolemy, who lived in thesecond centuryce, also had his name put on works of talismanic magic a thousandyears after his death.58But no classical writer accrued more spurious texts than thephilosopher Aristotle (384–322 bce). The most notable was theSecretum secretorum(Secret of secrets), which consisted of Aristotle’s apocryphal correspondence with hisformer pupil Alexander the Great while he wasWghting in Persia. It was translatedinto Latin from Arabic texts in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and containedadvice on talismanic magic. His name was also put on several works claiming toreveal Hermes Trismegistus’s secrets of astral magic.59In later centuries, though,Aristotle would come to be more associated in popular culture with lessesoteric publications on fortune-telling and sexual advice.60The classical grimoire24|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"tradition, as perceived by medieval chroniclers and romance writers, may havebeen spurious, but the medical and divinatory writings of some Greek andRomanauthors were enduring inXuences on manuscript and print magic. Pliny the Elder’sNatural History, for instance, a monumental compilation of information regardingthe natural world, was particularly well mined by compilers of grimoires andworks on natural magic. Amongst the descriptions of medicinal plants, animals,and gemstones were numerous examples of their hidden properties and eYcacy asamulets. The line of transmission of some of this classical knowledge to the Weststemmed from the religious and scientiWc cultures of Arab Islam.The Muslim Moors of North Africa swept across the Iberian peninsular duringthe eight century brushing aside the forces of the numerous fractious Christiankings in the region. By the beginning of the eleventh century the MoorishCaliphate had, itself, divided into some twenty feuding kingdoms whose rulerswere just as likely to ally themselves with the slowly encroaching Christian kingsof northwestern Spain as with their fellow Muslim rulers. These competitiverelations seem to have inspired aXourishing of Arabic scholarship and science inthe major Moorish cities, such as Saragossa, Co ́rdoba, and Seville. Impressiveroyal libraries of Arabic culture and learning were assembled, and amongst themwere works on medicine, alchemy, astrology, and astronomy. These wereeye-openers to inquisitive western and northern European Christian scholars,providing new access to the revered knowledge generated during the Hellenisticrule of the Near East.In terms of European grimoires, perhaps the most important Arabic inXuenceconcerned the interest in and practice of astral magic.61This was based on thenotion that the powers emanating from the planets and stars could be channelledinto talismans and images through the agency of named spirits and angels atastrologically propitious moments. Prayers were used to beseech and praise theactions of the spirits rather than to command or compel them as in the conjurationsof theClavicule of Solomonand the like. An example of how astral magic could beharnessed is found in aWfteenth-century grimoire in the Bavarian State Library:During theWfth day hour one should make an image to tame wild beasts,such as lions, bears, wolves, and any other wild and harmful beasts. At thishour cast an image of the animal of the sort you wish to control or tame,and on the head of the image carve the name of the animal, and on thechest the name of the hour and the name of the lord of the hour, and onthe stomach the seven names of theWrst hour, and fumigate the imagewith Indian wood and with red sandalwood, and bury the image in aplace of your choosing, and with the Lord’s help aiding you, you will seethat all those animals will be turned to your will.62Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|25"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The idea that divine and astral spirit forces could be harnessed by magical meansdates right back to the beginnings of recorded magic. It was practised in ancientBabylonia, and Jewish and Indian inXuences can also be found in the Arabicworks.63So the Moorish tradition brought to Spain was a fusion of Near Easterncultural contacts, which for theWrst timeWltered into the Western formulation ofnatural magic.Very few Christian European scholars could read Arabic though. So during thetwelfth century the centres of Spanish Moorish learning instigated a boom in thetranslation of the hitherto largely untapped wealth of Arabic learning into Latin.The centre of this profound exchange of literary religious, scientiWc, and magicalknowledge was the city of Toledo in central Spain.64It had been captured fromthe Moors in1085by Alfonso VI of Castile, who declared himself ‘the king of thetwo religions’. While many of the Muslim elite left, Arabic scholarship continuedamongst Moors who had converted to Christianity and amongst Christians whohad been culturally ‘Arabized’ after several centuries of Moorish rule. The city wasalso home to Jewish intellectualsXuent in Arabic. The impetus to translate worksinto Latin came from the interests of the one intellectual community in the citythat contained few Arabic readers, the French-dominated clergy running thecathedral and the numerous wandering scholars who travelled to stay withthem. Amongst them was the Norfolk clergyman Daniel of Morley. Sometimein the late twelfth century he set out for the Continent ‘for the purposes of study’.Unimpressed by his stay in Paris he set his sights on Toledo. ‘I hastened with allspeed,’ he wrote, ‘that I might attend the lectures of the wisest philosophers of theworld.’ He returned to England with a valuable collection of books.65And so itwas through such networks, and the demand of European universities for insightinto Arab knowledge, that new works on magic began to percolate through theContinent.Of the various Arabic astrological and magic texts to circulate in Europe as aconsequence of thisXourishing intellectual culture thePicatrixwas the mostinXuential.66Known in Arabic as theGh\u0003ayat al-Hak\u0003ım(The Aim of the Sage), thePicatrixseems to have been written by an Arabic scholar in Spain around themiddle of the twelfth century. We do not know his identity though it was falselyattributed by some to a well-known Spanish Arab mathematician. A century laterit was translated into Spanish and then into Latin under the orders of the Christianking of Castile, Alfonso the Wise. It was a compilation of instructions on astralmagic describing how to make astrological talismans by drawing into them thepower of the presiding spirits of the planets and stars. The rituals of conjuration fordoing this required the magician to wear elaborate apparel including helmets andswords. Animal sacriWces were involved such as a white dove to propitiate Venusand a black billy goat to honour Saturn. ThePicatrixdid not advocate demonic26|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"magic, but it is understandable why it was denounced as a work of necromancy bysome over the next few centuries. Its author boasted of having compiled it from224books. Be that as it may, it was obviously culled from various Arabicastrological, alchemical, magical, and Hermetic texts written in the Near Eastduring the ninth and tenth centuries, and ultimately derives from Greek, Syrian,Persian, and even Indian inXuences. Based on similar sources, a book of charmsand magic number squares called theShams al-ma’\u0003arif(Illumination of Knowledge),written in the thirteenth century by a famed magician named Ahmad bin Ali al-Buni (d.1225), went on to become the most inXuential magic book in Arabicpopular culture, but never permeated the European tradition to the extent of theLatin translation of thePicatrix.67While historians now recognize medieval Toledo as an extraordinarily enligh-tened centre of multicultural scholarship, for centuries afterwards it had a disrep-utable reputation as the hub of necromancy. The French priest and writerHe ́linand of Froidmont, who died in the1220sor1230s, observed for instancethat clergymen seeking instruction found the liberal arts in Paris, the law inBologna, medicine in Salerno, and demons in Toledo.68The city’s reputationfor black magic was spread across northern Europe not only through such clericalcondemnation but also through the popularity of French and German romanceliterature in which Toledo and its magicians were represented as a potent sourceof supernatural power in tales of chivalric adventure.69As to the reality, in1234anecromancer from Toledo was apparently found teaching magic in Maastricht.70The Italian monk Francesco Maria Guazzo, writing in the early seventeenthcentury, recounted the cautionary legend of the friar and physician BlessedGiles (d.1265) of Santare ́m, Portugal. This vice-ridden scion of a rich family,while on his way to study at Paris, fell in with a demon in human disguise whopersuaded him to visit a vast cavern in Toledo. Here he met demons and theirworshippers, and signed a pact with the Devil. For the next seven years he ‘deeplystudied the Black Arts and Magic’ before eventually seeing the error of his ways.71The legend of a cave in Toledo where magic had been practised for centuries, andwhere a powerful grimoire lay hidden, seems to have developed in the latemedieval period.72One of the stories written by Don Juan Manuel, a four-teenth-century Spanish nobleman from the province of Toledo, who unusuallywrote in Castilian rather than Latin, concerns a deacon from Santiago whobecomes a pupil of a great magician of Toledo called don Ylla ́n who has anunderground library and workshop. The deacon eventually becomes Pope andungratefully threatens to imprison his old master for practising sorcery.73The Toledo legend was developed and given further legitimacy in the seven-teenth century by the historian Cristo ́bal Lozano. He wrote a fantastical accountof how during theRoman period there existed under the city a vast subterraneanAncient and Medieval Grimoires|27"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"palace of Hercules where magic was studied and practised. This occult under-world collapsed and for centuries lay buried until, according to Lozano’s take onhistory, in1543the archbishop of Toledo organized an excavation and found analtar decorated with bronze statues. A loud noise was heard when they enteredand some of the party died of fright. The archbishop ordered that the entrance besealed once more to prevent its evil manifestations from spreading. One source ofthe legend is the archaeological remnants of a short subterranean passageXankedby twoRoman columns, which was probably intended to act as nothing moremagical than a sewer or drain.74Similar stories circulated regarding the city ofSalamanca, where the second oldest university in Spain was founded in1218. Theearliest reference to a cave-school of magic there is from a French chronicle fromthe mid-Wfteenth century. It is clear that Salamanca, by now considered the majorcentre of learning, was deliberately or mistakenly associated with the old ToledoHercules legend. It proved enduring. The Jesuit theologian Martı ́n DelRio(1551–1608), who studied at the university, wrote,I have read that, as a result of the Moorish occupation of Spain, themagical arts were virtually the only subjects being taught in Toledo,Seville and Salamanca. When I was living in Salamanca, I was shown asecret vault which had been blocked oVwith rubble on the orders ofQueen Isabella. It was a place where forbidden knowledge was taught.75As DelRio’s account indicates, the great age of Arabic-inspired magic in Spainwas thought to have been eVectively suppressed by King Ferdinand and his wife,Isabella, the monarchs who forged a united Spain during the lateWfteenth andearly sixteenth centuries. The credulous twentieth-century witchcraft historian,Montague Summers, who believed wholeheartedly in the legends regardingToledo and Salamanca, expressed great satisfaction that the monarchs hadrooted out ‘these horrible and ill-famed schools’, these ‘abominations’.76In fact,Ferdinand and Isabella, who sanctioned the setting up of theWrst permanentInquisition, endorsed the forced conversion of Muslims and ordered the expulsionof the Jews, putting an end to a rich history of religious, cultural, and scientiWccollaboration.The other important meeting place of Arabic and European scholarship wasConstantinople. The city was the seat of the ByzantineRoman Empire, and in thetwelfth century, after a long period of dwindling inXuence, it experienced aresurgence, in part due to its trading links with Venice and also the moneygenerated from the large numbers of Crusaders and other Westerners it attracted.Art and architectureXourished. It was here, in1169, that theKyranides, a book ofnatural magic containing a mix of charms, amulets, and medicine, was translatedinto Latin from a Greek text on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel28|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Comnenus. An ancient Persian king purportedly wrote it, though it probably datesto no earlier than theWrst few centuriesce. Some copies stated the Greek versionwas a translation from the Arabic, but this is unlikely even though Arabic versionsapparently circulated. TheKyranidesbecame the most notorious work of magic inmedieval Constantinople, as is evident from several trials heard by the city’s EasternOrthodox Church Synod in1370. A copy was found amongst a number of magicbooks, including one full of demonic invocations and spells, packed in boxes in thehouse of one Gabrielopoulos. He was possibly a monk and doctor, and wasevidently a majorWgure in the dissemination of grimoires in and around thecity.77Italian manuscript versions also circulated further west, and in the seven-teenth century several print versions were produced in German and English.The importance of Hebrew scholars in the translation of Arabic texts hasalready been noted, and now we must turn to the inXuence of Jewish magic onEuropean tradition. The importance of the Torah in the formation of the found-ing myths of grimoires is clear, as is the inXuence of Jewish magic in the Graeco-Egyptian papyri. As with Christian and Arabic magic, though, the medievalperiod heralded new developments as well as a continuation of traditions fromantiquity. Once again, the heady intellectual world of medieval Spain wascentre stage.During the twelfth century some Spanish Jewish intellectuals became particu-larly interested in astral magic, for instance, incorporating it into their theologiesand philosophies of medicine. Through the Jewish scholarly community it sub-sequently permeated more widely in Europe, with astral magic being included inthe medical syllabuses of the universities of Montpellier and Bologna.78As to the circulation of Jewish grimoires in medieval Europe the picture is lessclear. We know how prominent Jewish magic was in Egypt in late antiquity, andit was a considerable inXuence on the later Arabic tradition, but determining whatwas available in the medieval period is, for the moment, a matter of guesswork, asmuch research remains to be done.79The now well-knownBook ofRaziel, forinstance,Wrst appeared as a uniWed text in a version printed in Amsterdam in1701,though its various treatises on magic and mysticism clearly derive from a muchearlier period. The most notorious Jewish grimoire, theSefer ha-RazimorBook ofMysteries, was pieced together from a series of fragments by a rabbinic scholar inthe1960s.80It is related to theBook ofRazieland likewise purports to consist ofknowledge revealed to Noah by the angel. Amongst its numerous spells andangelic conjurations is the following piece of necromancy:If you wish to consult a ghost, stand facing a tomb and recall the names ofthe angels of theWfth camp, holding in your hand a new glass bowlcontaining oil and honey mixed together, and say thus:Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|29"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"‘I adjure you, O Spirit,Ram-bearer, who dwells among the gravesupon the bones of the dead, that you will accept from my hand hisoVering, and do my will by bringing me N son of N who is dead.Raisehim up so that he will speak to me without fear, and tell me the truthwithout deception. Let me not be afraid of him, and let him answerwhatever question I need to ask him.’‘Ram-bearer’ is a Greek term for Hermes, and other linguistic and textualevidence suggests the original work was probably composed in Palestine some-time in theWfth or sixth centuryce. It is, according to one expert, ‘theWrstattested Jewish grimoire’ in the sense that it is theWrst example of a Hebrew bookof black magic akin to the necromantic works of the Christian medieval world.81There is certainly no lack of evidence for medieval Jewish magic, though, andin recent years work hasWnally begun on exploring the amulets, spells, andconjurations found in the CairoGenizah, one of the most important repositoriesof ancient and medieval Jewish literature. Agenizahis a hiding place and the onehoused in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo, which was founded in882, contained tensof thousands of pages of papyri and parchment on Jewish theology, philosophy,and much else besides, providing important insights regarding both Jewish andEgyptian cultures in the region. The CairoGenizahhad been known about in theWest since the mid-eighteenth century, but its literary treasures only began to beexplored late in the following century when they were dispersed to libraries acrossEurope and America. By piecing together the fragments from theGenizahandcomparing them with European Jewish manuscripts of the medieval and earlymodern periods, which is just how theSefer ha-Razimwas reconstructed, histor-ians are showing the interplay of Arab and Judaic magical traditions.82The discovery of a Hebrew magic manuscript in the CairoGenizahthat wasprobably written in eleventh-century southern Italy is just one indication of howthe exchange of esoteric ideasXowed both ways across the Mediterranean at thetime. The most inXuential example of this was the development of the Jewishmystical interpretation of the Torah known as Kabbalah, which emerged intwelfth-century Provence before developing further in the Spanish cities. WhileKabbalah was underpinned by complex theological and philosophical debatesgenerated amongst European Jewish scholars, its practical application was moredirectly shaped and inXuenced by the fusion of occult traditions in Spain, andArabic astral magic in particular. Put very simply, practical Kabbalah was based onthe premise that Hebrew was the language spoken by God, and as such the lettersof the Hebrew alphabet were connected to God through divine emanations. Sotoo were the secret names of God transmitted orally to Moses and which provideda key to the written Torah. The magical potential of this obviously appealed to30|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"magicians, whether Islamic, Jewish, or Christian. By using combinations ofHebrew letters and ‘secret’ names of the divinity they could enhance the powerof talismans and more directly communicate with the angelic world. Such was thesymbolic allure of the appearance of Hebrew characters that in some Europeangrimoires words and characters were invented that looked like Hebrew but in facthad no recognizable meaning.Of all the numerous Jewish holy names for God, Tetragrammaton became themost widely used and recognizable in the European magic tradition. It was, infact, a Greek translation of the Hebrew name ‘YHWH’ (Yahweh). Jewishreligious laws forbade its pronouncement, and in writing other than in the HolyScriptures, it was usually indicated by abbreviations or signs. Although Europeanclergymen condemned a legend that Jesus owed his miraculous powers to sur-reptitiously learning it from the Temple in Jerusalem, the word ‘Tetragrammaton’was frequently used in medieval Christian charms and amulets, and subsequentlyWltered into the popular magic of Europe and beyond through grimoires.83For ourWnal, albeit minor ingredient in the medieval grimoire cooking pot weneed to look northwards to Scandinavia, where Christianity only supplantedpaganism in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Grimoires orgaldrabækrwere clearlya part of the magical tradition of medieval Iceland. They are referred to in Churchstatutes and other ecclesiastical writings, and also appear in a fourteenth-centurystory of a student using his master’s magic book to raise a storm.84What theyconsisted of we can only surmise from later surviving examples from the sixteenthcentury. On this basis we can assume the medieval books were based heavily onthe literary magic found elsewhere in Europe at the time, with the special additionof runic symbols.Runes were the alphabet of the cultures of northern Germanyand Scandinavia, and were brought to England and elsewhere by invading Anglo-Saxons and Vikings. They seem to have developed during theWrst few centuriesof theWrst millennium, though their use was gradually supplanted by Latin asChristianity spread across the region. Perhaps before, but certainly after Chris-tianity was established, runes accrued magical properties. In the mid-fourteenthcentury a Norwegian archbishop issued warnings about the use of ‘runes, blackmagic and superstition’, and as we shall see in the next chapter, people in Icelandwere executed for the harmful use of runes during the period of the witch trials.85By this time they also served a cryptographic purpose in the magical tradition.This is most evident from several runic versions of the SATORAREPO wordsquare found in medieval Swedish and Norwegian manuscripts.86Runes were largely restricted to Scandinavian grimoires but they have also beenfound in a magic book from southern Germany, and even more intriguingly froma fourteenth-century manuscript of Italian provenance which is now in the BritishLibrary.87The latter work bore the heading ‘this book belongs to the spiritualAncient and Medieval Grimoires|31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"works of Aristotle, and it is the bookAntimaquis, which is the book of the secretsof Hermes.’ It is essentially a work of Arabic astral magic related to thePicatrixandalso contains spells for invisibility and love. The ‘runae’, as the scribe calls them,are used as a cryptic means of writing the names of planetary spirits, just as pseudo-Hebraic or Chaldean characters were used in other grimoires. Their depiction andtheir names are so garbled and corrupt that little sense can be made of them,though it is clear that the original author of the manuscript had some knowledgeof the runic alphabet. As such the manuscript represents a rare counter-Xow ofmagical knowledge from north to south.Saints, popes, and meddling monksAt this point readers might be thinking, with some justiWcation, that there was notmuch distinctly Christian about the literary magic of Europe. How could medi-eval magicians profess to be true Christians? Well, Christian prayers and blessingswere also integral to the magic contained in grimoires. Christ, Mary, and theapostolic saints were all appealed to for protection from harm, while apocryphalaccounts of encounters between New TestamentWgures were the basis for charmsthat endured right into the present century. The sign of the Cross, holy water, andconsecrated paraphernalia were important defences against inadvertently conjur-ing up demons. Although a blasphemous act, the Mass was used in some conjur-ations, and was notoriously inverted and perverted in the lurid confessions oftortured witches and in reality by some debauched necromancers in the earlymodern period. The Church also inspired a new generation of bogus grimoireauthors. We have seen how in the early centuries of Christianity the clergy andeven bishops came under suspicion for practising magic, and from the medievalperiod onwards theWnger of accusation also pointed higher up the hierarchy atpopes and saints. What does this tell us? That ordination, piety, and power wereno safeguards against the suspicions and jealousies generated by successful careeradvancement, wealth, and political inXuence. I will begin, though, with a saintwho probably never existed.Saint Cyprian of Antioch is a legendary third-century Christian martyr who,through confusion with the very real Cyprian of Carthage (martyred in258 ce),came to have an enduring reputation as a magician and grimoire author.88The conXation occurred in Christian writings as early as the late fourth century.The Spanish poet Prudentius related how Cyprian practised magic spells ‘amid thetombs to raise passion in a wife and break the law of wedlock’.89By the medievalperiod the story of Cyprian the magician had developed into three books tellinghis conversion, confession, and martyrdom, with Greek, Latin, Syriac, Coptic,32|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"and Arabic manuscripts circulating across Europe and the Near East. In hisconfession Cyprian tells of how he had, as a child, been devoted to Apollo andbeen introduced to the mysteries of Mithras. On Mount Olympus he saw bandsof demons and the armies of the gods. He later travelled to Egypt and Babyloniawhere he was instructed in Chaldean magic, alchemy, and astrology. He returnedto Antioch a great magician revered by the local pagans. His road to Christianitybegan when he was asked by a client to use his magic to force a Christian womannamed Justa to accept his amatory advances. Cyprian called up a demon using hisbooks of magic. Justa’s virginal Christian armour repelled the demon’s assaults.Stronger demons were conjured up but they too failed. Incensed by the impo-tence of his magic, Cyprian vented his frustration on the people of the city until herealized that nothing could beat the sign of the Cross and so renounced his magicand paganism. In his confession he recalled how he wrote to the bishop, and‘brought the books of sorcery unto him while all the honourable men of the citywere present, and I burned them withWre.’90He subsequently rose to be bishop,before he and Justa (now Latinized to Justina) were tragically martyred. Thislegend of Cyprian the magician was reinforced in the early modern period by itsallegoric use by poets and dramatists. The EnglishRenaissance physician andastrologer Anthony Ascham wrote a poem about ‘Sanct Cipriane, the GrettNigromancer’, and the famed seventeenth-century Spanish dramatist PedroCaldero ́n was also inspired by the story.91It is not surprising that spells and charms attributed to Cyprian also circulatedfrom early on in the Near East. An eleventh-century Coptic love spell consists of aWrst-person confession by Cyprian relating his attempt to use his magic againstJusta, and includes a conjuration to an angel rather than a demon that begins, ‘Yea,I adjure you, O Gabriel: Go to N. daughter of N. Hang her by the hair of her headand by the lashes of her eyes. Bring her to him, N. son of N., in longing anddesire.’92‘Scrolls of Cyprian’ were worn as talismans in Armenia into the modernperiod, with an account of his life and times appearing in a popular Armenianbook of protective ‘prayers for all occasions’ printed in Constantinople in1712.The prayer was also a component of a common early-modern Ethiopian Christianmagic book known as theArde’etorThe Disciples.93In the West, the prayers ofSaint Cyprian were used in love magic, but while Trithemius apparently owned ademonological treatise bearing his name, it was only in the late eighteenth centurythat Cyprian grimoires began to circulate widely in parts of Europe. One late-nineteenth-century Spanish grimoire, for instance, related how in the year1001aGerman monk named Jonas Sufurino, librarian of the monastery of Brooken,conjured up the Devil on a mountaintop one night and was given a copy ofCyprian’s magic book as reward.Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TheSworn Book of Honorius, whichWrst appeared in theWrst half of thethirteenth century, has nothing to do with the Emperor Honorius. Accordingto the earliest Latin manuscripts it was written by one Honorius of Thebes, son ofEuclid—presumably the fourth-centuryceGreek mathematician of that namewho lived in Alexandria, and whose work wasWrst translated into Latin in thetwelfth century. It tells how it originated from the meeting of a general council of811Masters of Magic from the main centres of the occult arts, Naples, Athens,Toledo, and Thebes. They nominated Honorius to preside over the compilationof all their magic books into one text, three copies of which were to be made.Only the godly and faithful who had sworn an oath and been tested for the spaceof a year were to be allowed access to it. The reason for the endeavour was themagicians’ fear that the pope and his cardinals, envious and diabolically inspired,were planning a campaign to suppress them and burn their books.94TheSwornBookrepresented, then, a radical challenge to the Church. As to the magic itcontained, which Honorius declares follows the precepts of Solomon, the surviv-ing manuscripts consist of a series of prayers, some in a nonsensical mix ofpurported Chaldean and Hebrew, spirit names, circles, and stars. By followingits lengthy instructions magicians would be able to have a vision of God, hell, andpurgatory, and obtain countless treasures and knowledge of all science.Move forward a few centuries to the late1600s and weWnd manuscriptscirculating amongst Parisian magicians bearing the titleGrimoire du Pape Honorius.They were not direct copies of the survivingWfteenth-century versions it wouldseem, but similar enough. Somewhere along the way the Theban Honorius withhis Egyptian aura was supplanted by the crusading Italian Pope Honorius III(1148–1227). In the late eighteenth century the widespread circulation of acheap printed version of theGrimoiresealed this new tradition. One nineteenth-century historian of magic suggested that the attribution was a deliberate act ofvengeance orchestrated by persecuted medieval magicians who desired to placeresponsibility for their diabolic crimes on the papacy.95Maybe the association wasto do with Honorius III’s failed Crusade to capture Egypt or because of hisprotection of the Knights Templar, who, in the early fourteenth century, wereaccused of sorcery and worshipping a diabolic idol named Baphomet. Then again,perhaps the enterprising scribe whoWrst penned theGrimoire du Pape Honoriusinthe second half of the seventeenth century was ignorant of the legend of theTheban magician, and the only Honorius he or she knew was of the papal kind.Honorius III was not the only medieval pope to get an unwarranted magicalmakeover. A similar fate befell Leo III, who presided over the Vatican between795and816. A protective letter that he purportedly sent to Charlemagne, theWrstHolyRoman Emperor, was circulating in manuscript by the early sixteenthcentury, and in the late seventeenth century this was used as the basis for a French34|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"manuscript magicenchiridionor handbook.

A less necromantic version was printed several decadeslater.96While Honorius’s reputation was apparently an invention of the seventeenthcentury, there were other popes about whom magical reputations circulatedwidely in scholarly circles back in the medieval period, but who did not havethe ignominious honour of having grimoires named after them in later centuries.The most renowned or notorious of these was Gerbert, Pope Silvester II, whoseshort pontiWcate lasted between999and1003.Rumours of his dabbling in theblack arts were circulating from at least the twelfth century when the Englishchronicler William of Malmesbury, in listing Gerbert’s impressive breadth ofscientiWc knowledge, mentioned that he knew ‘the art of calling up spirits fromhell’ and had used the ‘art of necromancy’ to discover hidden treasures inRome.One rumour suggested that heXed from his study of magic in Toledo after stealinghis master’s grimoire. Over the next few centuries, legends of his relations withthe Devil also developed so that by the ProtestantReformation Silvester’s repu-tation was suYciently besmirched for Catholic historians to try and rehabilitate hispapacy.97In the case of Pope Boniface VIII (d.1303), rumour and legend added tothe political machinations that led to his posthumous trial between1303and1311on charges of demonic magic amongst other crimes. He was accused of havingthree demons under his control and a ring containing a spirit. One witness testiWedthat he had seen Boniface drawing a magic circle in his garden, sacriWcing acockerel within it, and then dripping its blood on aWre while reading out ademonic conjuration from a grimoire.98The stories of magic-wielding popes were seized upon with relish by ProtestantReformers in the sixteenth century and ampliWed for propaganda purposes. Themathematician John Napier (1550–1617) declared that twenty-two popes hadbeen ‘abominable Necromancers’ who had bound themselves to the Devil andused their magic powers to accrue power and wealth. The names of some of thistarnished twenty-two were listed in the preface to a pamphlet on the trial of anEnglish folk magician in1566. The aim was to link the perceived contemporaryplague of sorcery and witchcraft with the Catholic past. So Pope Alexander VIwas described as a ‘horrible Sorcerer’ who ‘gave hymselfe body and soule’ to‘wicked Sprites and Divels’, while Pope Gregory the VII (Hildebrand) was ‘a greatSorcerer and Nigromancer’. John Bale, a friar turned Protestant reformer, con-cluded that the magic of the popes far exceeded that of the ‘soothsayers ofEgypte’.99The question arises why some popes were later chosen as spuriousgrimoire authors and others were not. Maybe Silvester and Hildebrand did notAncient and Medieval Grimoires|35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"attract grimoires for the same reason as Simon Magus. For Protestants, and someCatholics, they had besmirched reputations for diabolism, whereas the names ofLeo and Honorius could be used to promote the legitimacy of magic.While the medieval andReformation stories of necromantic popes and earlysaints were mostlyWctions turned into dubious facts, there is ample evidence thatthe medieval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore theowners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires. Monasteries were certainlyimportant repositories of magic books. During theWrst half of the fourteenthcentury, for example, a collection of over thirty magic texts were donated toSt Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury, by at leastWve diVerent monks. Later in thesamecentury the impressivebook collection of Friar John Erghome, which, at some300volumes, was one of the largest personal libraries in the country at the time,became part of the library of the Austin Friars at York. It included magic worksattributed to Solomon, theSworn Book of Honorius, and an inXuential Arabic workon astrology by the ninth-century astrologer and scientist al-Kindi.100We shouldnot think of monks as cloistered away from the wider community. Many friarsserved as parish priests as well as preachers, and so there was plenty of opportunity toshare their privileged access to magic books with the educated laity. Over and overagain in the trials of monks involved in treasure hunting escapades weWnd themworking together with the likes of schoolmasters and clerks.The universities of Europe were the other main centres of grimoire productionand consumption. William of Auvergne, who was bishop of Paris in the earlytwelfth century, recalled how while a student he had seen and handled some of themagic books available in the city.101In the medieval period universities wereessentially religious institutions but they provided a fertile social environment inwhich clergy and lay scholars intermingled, debated, and pushed boundaries,particularly in theWfteenth century when the university training of medical andlegal professions became increasingly separated from ecclesiastical control. Manystudents never actually graduated but attained enough education and workingknowledge of Latin to obtain administrative jobs such as clerks. In the year theyspent at university, and in the humming social and intellectual world of the cities,there was ample opportunity to consult books of magic. The rather shaky Latin ofsome surviving medieval grimoires suggests that this group of scholars weresigniWcant players in the circulation and practical use of magic books.102Theywere part of what has been called the ‘clerical underworld’ of magic. This wasinhabited by monks but also a range of minor clergy, parish priests, and curateswho did not necessarily have a university education, and may not have been wellversed in theology niceties, but who possessed enough knowledge of Churchritual and exorcism to employ grimoires.10336|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Considering the clergy had a near monopoly on access to grimoires, at leastuntil theWfteenth century, it is understandable that clerics who wrote aboutmagic, or who were associated with the major scholarly centres of the occultsciences, would accrue unjustiWed reputations as being theauthorsof grimoires.The Scottish clergyman scientist and astrologer Michael Scot (1175–c.1232) was acritic of magic, but as he was canon of Toledo Cathedral during the height of thetranslation boom in the city, was proWcient in Hebrew and Arabic, and translatedsome of the works of Aristotle, rumour later had it that he had also picked up thesecrets of necromancy during his stay. It seems that theWrst magic books bearinghis name circulated around Europe in theWfteenth century. The German abbotTrithemius possessed a book of demonological invocations attributed to Scotwhich instructed how to conjure up familiar spirits.104A sixteenth- or seven-teenth-century grimoire in the JohnRylands Library, Manchester, is entitledMichael Scot’s Magic Book. By this time his transformation into an adventurouswizard hadWltered into popular legends and tales in his homeland of Scotland andfurther aWeld.105A generation on, the famed English scientist and Franciscan friarRoger Bacon(c.1214–94), who criticized Scot for not understanding the sciences, suVered asimilar fate after his death.106Bacon believed that books falsely ascribed toSolomon ‘ought all to be prohibited by law’, and grumbled at those who ‘putfamous titles upon their works and impudently ascribe them to great authors inorder to more powerfully allure men to them’.107He would be turning in hisgrave to know that by the mid-sixteenth century John Bale could list numerousLatin occult manuscripts attributed to Bacon, including such suggestive titles asDenecromanticis imaginibusandPracticas magiæ. Around1527a priest named WilliamStapleton borrowed a book called theThesaurus Spirituumfrom a vicar to help himmagicallyWnd treasure. Although not listed by Bale, surviving manuscripts of thesame name, though of later date, were also attributed to Bacon. Another seven-teenth-century Baconian grimoire, entitled theNecromantia, includes instructionsfor conjuring up the spirits of the dead.108His spurious magical reputation furtherdeveloped and spread through a play written in1592, and a very popular cheapbook calledThe famous historie of Fryer Bacon Containing the wonderfull things that hedid in his life, which went through numerous reprints during the seventeenthcentury. In this Bacon, who learns the occult arts while at Oxford University, ispresented as a good-natured comic-hero with a love of using his magic to makemoral points. Things get more serious towards the end though. He pits his wits ina magic contest with a rival German conjuror named Vandermast where theystand in their magical circles a hundred feet apart and call up mythical creatures todo battle on their behalf.The famous historie of Fryer Baconconcludes with BaconAncient and Medieval Grimoires|37"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"repenting his use of magic. He calls together his friends, students, and scholars toannounce:I have found that my knowledge hath been a heavy burthen and hath keptdown my good thoughts: but I will remove the cause which are theseBooks; which I do purpose here before you all to burn. They all entreatedhim to spare the Books, because in them there were those things that afterages might receive great beneWts. He would not hearken unto them, butthrew them all into theWre, and in thatXame burnt the greatest learningin the world.109Turning to the Continent, one of the most notorious of the bogus grimoiresattributed to medieval scholars was theHeptameronof Peter d’Abano, an Italianwho studied at the University of Paris in the second half of the thirteenthcentury.110His numerous real works included discourses on medicine, physi-ognomy, poisons, and the celestial sciences. It was the latter interest that got himinto trouble with the Inquisition. The only times he brieXy discussed magic in hisnumerous works was with the aim of distinguishing it from the honourable studyof astrology. His interests overlapped with natural magic but otherwise there is noevidence to suggest he had anything to do with theHeptameron, which is con-cerned entirely with the ritual preparations for composing a magic circle andconjuring the angels. It would appear that, compared to Bacon, a longer periodelapsed before d’Abano became associated with grimoires, for the earliest veriW-able evidence of theHeptameronis in the mid-sixteenth century.111As we shall seein the next chapter, another manuscript attributed to d’Abano called theLucidariuswas found in the hands of several Italian treasure seekers. This was presumably aversion of theLucidator, a work that d’Abano probably did write, and whichcontains discussion on the art of geomancy. This was a form of divination basedon the interpretation of lines or dots marked on the ground or on parchment.Of all the magical works falsely attributed to medieval theologians and scientistsnone was more enduringly inXuential and widespread than those bearing the nameAlbertus Magnus (c.1193–1280). This German Dominican friar, one-time Bishopof Cologne, and author of numerous highly respected scientiWc works, attractedthe title ‘The Great’ in his own lifetime. Who better to promote a book of magic?Latin manuscripts of thesecrets of Albertorexperiments of Albertappeared during orshortly after his lifetime. They included some information from Albertus’s actualwork on minerals, but most of it was culled from Pliny and a pseudo-Aristotle. Itwas not a grimoire but rather a work on the ‘science of magic’. This was at leasthow one compiler deWned it in defending it against accusations of evil. In otherwords it was a book of natural magic and medicine like theKyranides, of which thecompiler was aware. But it came to be seen over the centuries as a dangerous38|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"grimoire by those who condemned it without reading it, and no doubt many whobought one of the many print versions produced across Europe from the earlysixteenth century onwards were left a little disappointed. Still, if for fun youwanted to see people standing around with the appearance of having camel’sheads, then thesecrets of Albertwas the book for you, advising the lighting of alantern anointed with the animal’s blood.112Using magicWhile for some the attraction of magic held out the possibility of such lofty aims aslearning languages and the secrets of nature, many owners of grimoires, particu-larly necromantic ones, had much baser motives on their minds, mostly concern-ing money and sex. Priests and monks made up many of the cases of treasurehunting investigated by the Inquisitions and ecclesiastical courts in the latemedieval period. Treasure hunting did not require magic, and the activity wasnot in itself heretical or ‘superstitious’, but tradition held that many buriedtreasures were guarded by ghosts and spirits. Who were you going to call? Whythe priests and monks who had access to the grimoires which instructed on how toconjure, exorcize, and control them. In England, in1466,Robert Barker ofBabraham, Cambridgeshire, was brought before his bishop to answer for havingin his possession ‘a book, and a roll of the black art containing characters, circles,exorcisms and conjurations; a hexagonal sheet with strangeWgures; six metal plateswith diverse characters engraved; a chart with hexagonal and pentagonalWguresand characters, and a gilded wand.’ These were to be used to conjure up a spiritthat would direct him to hidden gold and silver. He was sentenced to publicpenance, walking around the marketplaces of Ely and Cambridge in bare feet andcarrying his books and magical paraphernalia, which were subsequently burned inCambridge marketplace. Across the other side of Europe theWfteenth-centuryastronomer Henry the Bohemian, a member of the Polish royal household, wascharged in1429with possessing necromantic books andWnding buried treasurewith the aid of demons. He confessed, probably under torture, that he and severalcompanions, two of whom were professors at Krakow University, used books toconjure up treasure in the royal zoological garden.113In1517Don Campana, a Modenese priest and treasure hunter, confessed that‘he once had a book, calledClavicula Salomonis, and another book, calledAlmandeland some other booklets and writings with many love magic instructions, and hesaid he burned them all.’114Love magic was, indeed, as common a use ofgrimoires as treasure hunting in the period. The aim was either to enticeor coerce someone into having sex, enhance the sexual experience, or ensure aAncient and Medieval Grimoires|39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"long-lasting sexual relationship.115Such binding magic could be achieved using avariety of practices, from potions based on natural magic, to image magic andnecromancy. In Carcassonne, in southwestern France, a monk named PierreRecordi was sentenced to life imprisonment after confessing under torture toattempting to have control over women by oVering to the Devil wax puppetscontaining his saliva and the blood of toads. In the same town in1410a notarynamed Geraud Cassendi was tried by an inquisitor for attempting to debauchwomen by invoking demons using a magic book and gold scrapings from animage of the Virgin.116TheXip side of love magic was ensuring that people could not have sex.117ThePicatrixwas a useful source in this respect, providing advice for both causing andcuring magically inspired impotence. The following example of astral imagemagic for the purpose comes from a manuscript attributed to Ptolemy:When you wish to bind a man or woman, make an image of a man whosefeet are raised to the heavens and whose head is in the ground. Thisshould be made of wax, saying ‘I have bound N. son of such-and-such awoman, and all his veins, until he does not have a man’s desire.’ Afterthat, bury the image in his path, and he will not use a woman for as long asthe image lasts. And it is said by some that this image is made under thesecond decan of Aries.118Sex, inheritance, and political power were major preoccupations of Europe’saristocracy, and accusations of love magic and poisoning were prominent in theincreasing number of cases of heretical magic concerning royal courtiers that wereheard during the fourteenth century.The medieval clergy and nobility did not have a complete monopoly ongrimoires. Although, as we shall see in the next chapter, the spread of magicbooks down the social scale is clearly evident from the sixteenth century onwards,there are already signs of democratization towards the end of the medieval period.There is an account in French chronicles of a poorly educated sorcerer, ArnaudGuillaume, who in1393attempted to cure the king of witchcraft. He carried withhim a grimoire calledSmagorad, which gave him power over the stars and planets.It was said to have been a copy of a book given to Adam by an angel. A survivingGerman-language manuscript of theAlmandalwas included along with advice onhorticulture and medicine in the commonplace book of a lateWfteenth-centuryAugsburg merchant called Claus Spaun. His own annotations to the text suggestthat he had experimented with its angelic invocations. He added further practicalastrological guidance as to the appropriate angel to call upon, and made numerousinsertions insisting that the magus should kneel devoutly.11940|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Women had always been major consumers of literary magic, as the manywritten amulets for childbirth attest, but examples of women owning or usinggrimoires is scant before the sixteenth century.120InRoman antiquity there areallusions to the fact that some high-class prostitutes were literate and so could havepossessed and written magic books containing the love magic and binding spellsthat were their stock-in-trade. TheRoman poet Horace imagined his prostitute-witch creation, Canidia, possessing books of incantations, and there is no reason toassume that the small minority of literate women at the time werelesslikely to usegrimoires than literate men.121There are a few late medieval examples of womenhaving access to grimoires if not owning them. In1493Elena Dalok was broughtbefore a London ecclesiastical court charged with being a common slanderer,professing to be able to magically induce rain, and for saying she owned a bookthat told her of things to come.122This may have been an idle boast, but, if true,her book sounds more like an astrological or prophetic text rather than a grimoire.More convincing evidence comes from a trial six years later in Italy. BernardinaStadera, who was denounced in1499for being a ‘charmer, conjurer and procur-ess’, was accused, along with her lover, a priest, of reading demonic invocationsfrom a manuscript she had borrowed from some friars of Modena. She deposedthat one of the friars had:a book of paper, handwritten, with a white leather binding, of averagesize, which he lent to her. She kept that book for six months, meaning tocopy what was in it, even though she never did because she had been verybusy. She anyway read that book many and many times, and found howto make images and in what way they have to be baptised by a priest tomake people love each other, as well as how to curse the mass by saying,‘You’re lying in your throat’ when the priest says, ‘May the Lord be withyou,’ as she thinks. There was also a conjuration which included thenames of many saints, mixed with several names of demons.123The mistress of a French conjuring monk testiWed that she had heard him loudlyreciting passages from a grimoire, and on one occasion she accompanied him to ahill where he undressed and disappeared behind a bush with his magic books foran hour. She could not tell what he was up to. As with all confessions extractedunder the inquisitorial laws of medieval Europe, we need to be very cautiousabout taking such statements at face value. When in1370an illiterate womannamed Benvenuta Mangialoca confessed that her father-in-law had instructed herhow to invoke demons using ‘a big book’ she had almost certainly been subjectedto torture.124It can be assumed, then, that due to the high level of female illiteracy, and thephysical and social restrictions on women’s access to books, very few possessedAncient and Medieval Grimoires|41"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"grimoires, though some clearly knew of and had access to them. The masculinenature of medieval literary magic was also reinforced in the pages of grimoires, inwhich there is a strong emphasis on sexual purity and abstinence, reXecting theclergy’s vow of celibacy. TheSworn Book of Honoriusinstructed that it was not tobe given to women.Rituals often advised that the magician should not associatewith the opposite sex while preparing for conjurations and invocations, and thatthey were to be kept away from ritual paraphernalia. At the same time, many ofthe spells were to entice and impress women, while invisibility spells also oftenhad prurient aims. Either way, grimoire magic was clearly masculine in itsemphasis on the sexual self-control of the male magician and the sexual conquestof women. That is not to say that this misogynistic emphasis was mirrored in theactualuseof written magic—as we shall see in the next chapter.125Despite numerous clerical and secular condemnations of magic in the medievalperiod, attempts to suppress grimoires and their users were sporadic, ad hoc ratherthan systematic. In1277the Bishop of Paris issued a condemnation of ‘books,rolls, or booklets containing necromancy or experiments of sorcery, invocationsof demons, or conjurations hazardous for souls.’ Still, this was one of only a fewoYcial condemnations of forbidden books issued by the University of Paris thatexplicitly referred to magic.126In other words, other heretical texts were of moreimmediate concern at the time. We do know that the medieval inquisitions,which were instituted in the late twelfth century, and set up wherever andwhenever outbreaks of heresy were suspected, periodically found and burnedbooks of magic. In his manual for inquisitors the Spanish Dominican friar andgrand inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric (1320–99) recounted reading and burningnumerous grimoires conWscated from magicians, including works attributed toSolomon and Honorius.127The extent to which the authorities were successful insuppressing their circulation is very diYcult to assess. Many were obviouslyburned by theRoman and Orthodox Churches, while others were destroyed bytheir fearful owners. Although numerous books of natural and astral magic nodoubt ended up in theXames, it is likely that necromantic works fared far worse.Does the uneven pattern of surviving grimoires reXect the relative success ofthe Church authorities and the reach of the inquisitions in diVerent parts ofEurope? It could explain why the libraries of central Europe contain very fewexplicitly demonic grimoires. Maybe such works also circulated less in the regionbecause copyists and collectors were more nervous about transmitting demonicinvocations and conjurations.128We also need to bear in mind that many latemedieval grimoires were destroyed during the campaigns against witches andmagicians in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ruthlessness of whichalso varied from country to country.42|Ancient and Medieval Grimoires"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In1258Pope Alexander IV instructed inquisitors ‘not to intrude into investi-gations of divination or sorcery without knowledge of manifest heresy involved’.The crime of magic was otherwise to be dealt with by ecclesiastical courts and thesecular authorities. Acts of sorcery and divination that savoured of ‘manifestheresy’ were deWned as ‘praying at the altars of idols, to oVer sacriWces, to consultdemons, to elicit responses from them’.129DeWnitions of both heresy and magicwere by no means hard and fast in the period, and as this papal instructionindicates, a lot of magic was not heretical but merely ‘superstitious’ or rooted insinful ‘erroneous’ beliefs. But the deWnition of magic as heresy became increas-ingly all embracing from the late fourteenth century onwards. The long-standingbut socially restricted concern over the ritual magic used by clergy and courtiersbegan to extend to more popular, non-literary forms of harmful magic or sorcery.Increasingly all magic came to be redeWned as heretical in that it was all believedto be inspired by an ominously encroaching Devil. Grimoires, with theircomplex ceremonial invocations and conjurations, were no longer the only keysto demonic magic. With heretical magic unbound from the book, womenincreasingly became the focus of authoritarian concern. Before1350over70percent of those accused of magic in the courts were men, but during the earlyWfteenth century between60and70per cent were female.130Here lies the originof the witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when across muchof Europe the legislature ensured that the poor, the illiterate, and womensupplanted the privileged, erudite male owners of grimoires as the greatest magicalthreat to Christian society.Ancient and Medieval Grimoires|43"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTERTWOTHEWAR AGAINSTMAGICThe lateWfteenth and early sixteenth centuries heralded three profound andinterlinked events in European history that can be explored through thestory of grimoires: the rise of print, the Protestant and CatholicReformations, andthe witch trials. For some, the Devil lay behind all these momentous events.Printing was described as a ‘black art’ and books as ‘silent heretics’. The success oftheReformation was heavily dependent on the power of the printed page, withMartin Luther being the most published author of the era. For him and otherReformers printing was a ‘divine’ and ‘miraculous’ gift. For the papacy Luther wasthe Devil’s spawn and the presses a sewer of satanic propaganda. The EnglishCatholic clergymanRowland Philipps warned, ‘we must root out printing orprinting will root out us.’1For the Church, theReformation was further con-Wrmation of growing suspicions of a sustained attack by the Devil on ChristianEurope. A series of heresy and witch trials in the Alps during the second half of theWfteenth century had fuelled concerns. These were born out by the increasingnumber of German and Swiss states that rejectedRome and become Protestantfrom the1520s onwards. The Catholic Church launched its counter-oVensives.The Italian Inquisition was instituted in1542primarily to stem the Protestantthreat and the books that carried the heresy across the Alps. It followed the modelof the Spanish Inquisition and its regional tribunals, which had already beencombing the Spanish territories for other heretics for over sixty years.For the new Protestant Churches of northern and central Europe the corrup-tion of the old Church was portrayed as a sign of the arrival of the Antichrist in theguise of the Pope. Pre-millennial tension was a major condition of the age."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Devil was active everywhere and theologians thought they had discovered anever-expanding cohort of his earthly army consisting principally of poor women.The product of endless neighbourly rumour and suspicion, the popular concep-tion of the village witch was transformed into the greatest of satanic threatsthrough the theological reasoning of educated demonologists. And it is nocoincidence that the rise of the witch trials during the early sixteenth centuryoccurred in the same period that print was becoming a major cultural force. It wasdemonological books that spread the ideas and fears of this diabolic witchcraftconspiracy, and it was the printed pamphlets detailing their execrable crimes thatpenetrated far into the conscientiousness of the general population. The Englishlawyer and printer JohnRastell, writing in1530, was not wrong when hedescribed the advent of print as having ‘been the cause of great learning andknowledgejand hath been the cause of many things and great changesj& is liketo be the cause of many strange things here after to come.’2The laws against witchcraft instituted across Europe during theWrst half of thesixteenth century were not just concerned with harmful witches: all magic,whether good or bad, was considered the tool of the Devil. Some demonologists,both Protestant and Catholic, asserted that ‘good witches’ or cunning-folk, inother words those who practised magic to help people by removing spells,detecting stolen goods, and much else besides, were even worse than ‘black’witches. This was because the victims of witches did not become lost souls,whereas the clients of cunning-folk, by resorting to magic, risked damnation bybeing complicit in the Devil’s works. So the secular and religious authorities weremost keen to suppress all magical practitioners. While the common people sharedtheir enthusiasm for the extermination of witches, they were not, however, sokeen to see cunning-folk on the end of a rope, dismembered, or burned to death.Magic was an ambivalent force but a necessary one in most people’s lives, which iswhy printers, at considerable risk, soon saw the market potential. In1528thewarehouse of one Seville printer contained amongst its stock8,000printed sheetsofno ́minas, a thousand of which were hand-coloured. These consisted of prayers andnames of the saints used as protective talismans.N\u0002ominashad circulated on paper andparchment, and their appearance in print at such an early date demonstrates howprinters were quick to capitalize on ‘superstitious’ popular religion.3One of the mostpopular was the prayer of St Cyprian. As early as1498copies were being printed andsold in Spain, and they appeared in Italy not long after. That it was being used in amagical rather than a devotional religious sense, independent of the clergy, is evidentfrom the fact that the Church banned it several decades later.4As we shall see, thesetentative attempts to assuage the popular thirst for magical aid were theWrst steps inthe history of print’s slow but sure grip on the magical tradition. They also mark thebeginning of authoritarian attempts to stop this democratic process.War against Magic|45"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"TheRenaissance mageTheRenaissance has been deWned by the development of humanism, and theenthusiasm for the discovery and rediscovery of the intellectual world of theancientRomans and Greeks. As one historian has commented, ‘In theRenais-sance, the ‘‘new’’ meant the ‘‘old,’’ the very old.’5It was supported by thepatronage of a new wealthy urban elite, and spread through the medium ofprint. However, there was nothing particularly revolutionary about theRenais-sance in intellectual terms, and historians are now increasingly emphasizing thattheXowering of theRenaissance emerged from branches of medieval scholarship.So where does that leave the notion ofRenaissance magic? There was no ‘rebirth’of magic, no great break with the past, but rather a continuation and developmentof medieval ideas about the secrets encoded in ancient texts, be they pagan,Jewish, Islamic, or Christian, and the possible role that magic could play as anadjunct of Christian theology.6Nevertheless, there were some signiWcant developments in the magic traditionduring theRenaissance. One was the spread of Hermeticism in western Europeanthought. TheCorpus hermeticumwere a group of Greek religious and philosophicaltexts written in theWrst few centuries after Christ. Although clearly inXuenced byGreek philosophy, they were thought to encapsulate the far more ancientthoughts of Hermes Trismegistus. We have seen that Hermetic writings wereknown in medieval Europe, but their intellectual relevance was boosted massivelywhen, in1460, a Byzantine monk brought a version of theCorpusto Florence,where it was translated into Latin by Marsilio Ficino (1433–99) and published in1471.7As a consequence, Ficino became a centralWgure in the world of intellec-tual occultism. His conception of magic was hugely inXuential, and the lynchpinof the intellectual magic traditions of the early modern period based on theNeoplatonic concept of a universe in which all things were interconnected byspiritual bonds. The other signiWcant development of theRenaissance, whichwould have more of an inXuence on the development of future grimoires thanHermeticism, was the spreading inXuence of Kabbalah in European magicalthought. The mystical system of Kabbalah that developed in medieval Spain hadbeen percolating into Christian magic before the lateWfteenth century, but it wasits espousal by another Florentine philosopher and natural magician, Pico dellaMirandola (1463–94), that introduced it to a new readership and led to renewedengagement with its occult promises.8JohannesReuchlin, a German humanistscholar and expert in Greek and Hebrew, further advanced its inXuence north ofthe Alps. In1490he travelled south and visited Pico—a sign of the developingEuropean network of occult philosophers.46|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The resurgent interest in Hermeticism and Kabbalah would also act as inspir-ation forRosicrucianism. During the early seventeenth century several curiousGerman publications appeared claiming the existence of an occult fraternityfounded by aWfteenth-century German knight named ChristianRosenkreutzwho was an adept in Hermetic and Kabbalistic magic. His followers, the Brother-hood of theRosy Cross, were dedicated to a spiritual reformation of societythrough magical principles. There is no evidence that the Brotherhood existed,but the pamphlets generated considerable interest and were quickly translated intoother languages. While some, such as the Jacobean playwright Ben Jonson, pokedfun at the ‘Chimera of theRosie Crosse, Their Charmes, their Characters,HermettickeRings’,9others took the story seriously. We shall encounter theRosicrucians again with regard to the esoteric Freemasonry movements of theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Much has been written on the nature ofRenaissance magic, and its role in thedevelopment of science, but what I want to focus on here is the way in whichnatural magic and its practitioners were caught up in the authoritarian view that allmagic, whether witchcraft, natural magic, celestial magic, or spirit conjuration,was demonic in origin and intent. It was the notoriety generated by theseassociations that led later generations to associate the misrepresented reputationsof the greatRenaissance magicians with sinister conjuration. In the process, thesixteenth-century heirs to the Florentine magicians became the new generation ofbogus grimoire authors, joining the biblical magicians, medieval popes, and saintsin the occultWrmament.The most important of theRenaissance era magicians in this story was the Germanhumanist scholar Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486–1535).10Hewas a well-travelled young man due to his military service and his spirit of intellectualadventure, and studied at the universities of Cologne and Paris. He was interested inthe occult from an early age, reading the work of that other famous inhabitant ofCologne, Albertus Magnus. He also studied the works of the ItalianRenaissancemages, and when, around1511, he found himself in Italy on military business he tookthe opportunity to further his knowledge on Kabbalah and Hermeticism. TheGerman Benedictine abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) was another import-ant inXuence closer to home.11Trithemius had experimented with drawing benignspirits into crystals, and his most well-known magical workSteganographia(Secretwriting), which was written around1499but only published in Frankfurt in1606,posited the existence of an occult code that would enable communication withspirits and angels. Trithemius possessed and pored over the key medieval magicalmanuscripts in circulation at the time. Through his writings elements of the medievalgrimoires, which otherwise remained unpublished until the modern era, found theirway into print. Agrippa dedicated his own opusDe occulta philosophia, later known asWar against Magic|47"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"hisThree Books of Occult Philosophy, to Trithemius. It contained a rich distillation ofthe celestial wisdom to be gained through the practice of natural magic, ceremonialangelic communication, and Kaballah, and the occult sympathies that united thematerial and elemental worlds. He had written a draft of this around1510but he onlyhad it published in Antwerp in1533. By this time he had, like other prominentRenaissance mages, already publicly disavowed and condemned such ‘vain sciences’as Kabbalah, magic, and alchemy, along with a more extreme denunciation ofastronomy, geometry, and arithmetic. This makes his decision to publish his earlyviews rather curious.The impressively named Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombatus vonHohenheim (1493–1541) was a German-speaking contemporary of Agrippa.Paracelsus, as he was thankfully better known, was a Swiss physician whoseexperiments and ideas regarding medicine, alchemy, astrology, and celestialmagic were hugely inXuential across Europe.12Very few of his writings werepublished in his lifetime, and, as with Agrippa’sOpera, the corpus of worksbundled together and edited after his death probably contains some that he didnot write.13Of the supreme mysteries of nature, translated into English in1655, may ormay not be one such pseudo-Paracelsian work. Its contents certainly reXectedParacelsus’s views on the division between good and bad magic. It containedinstructions on how to create a series of metal lamens engraved with occultsymbols and secret words of power, each eVective against speciWc medical condi-tions. ‘Characters and Seals have likewise in them wonderful virtue, which is not atall contrary to nature, nor superstitious,’ he explained. Conjuration was anothermatter altogether, and inOf the supreme mysteries‘Ceremonial Nigromancers’ aredenounced as ‘arch-Fools, and ignorant men of no worth!’ All conjurations‘are against God, and are contrary to his word’.14Despite their denunciations of ‘vain’ and demonic magic Agrippa and Paracel-sus became the two most reviled and misrepresented magicians of the era, and thesubject of numerous published attacks. Slanderous andWctitious stories circulatedabout their satanic activities. By the end of the sixteenth century the legend thatAgrippa kept a demonic familiar in the shape of a black dog was widely believed.The followers of Paracelsian medicine constantly had to fend oVaccusations thathe was ‘a magician and an impostor who had dealings with demons’.15The evilreputations of both men circulated far and wide. An English pamphlet written in1631by a Buckinghamshire parson attacking the concept of the weapon-salve, asympathetic magic technique attributed to Paracelsus whereby wounds werehealed by treating the oVending weapon with the patient’s blood, became awider attack on the two occult philosophers. Paracelsus was declared to be ‘aWitch and Conjurer’ and Agrippa’s books of occult philosophy denounced asbeing ‘stuVed with Conjurations of the divell’.1648|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The diabolic reputations and legends surrounding both men were furthercoloured by association with the hugely popular legend of Dr Faust or Faustusand his tragic relations with the Devil. An itinerant magician named Georg Faustcertainly existed, though his sketchy history has been obscured by confusion withother men bearing the same surname.17He was a contemporary of Agrippa andParacelsus who developed a reputation for diabolic magic in several German statesin his own lifetime. Complaints about him pop up here and there in the books andletters of humanists and occult philosophers of the period. The earliest referenceto Faust is in a letter written by Trithemius in1507, in which he is also identiWedFig.1Dr Faustus depicted in seventeenth-century literature.War against Magic|49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"as one Georgius Sabellicus, ‘who dares to call himself the prince of necromancers,is a vagrant, a charlatan, and a rascal’. In1513the humanist Konrad Muth wrotethat he had heard one Georg Faustus bragging at an inn about his prowess as afortune-teller. Martin Luther made a reference to him in1537. After his death,around1539–40, perhaps in Luther’s Wittenberg, Faust became a magnet for avariety of old legend motifs of magical escapades and diabolic pacts that transmit-ted orally and in print around central and northern Europe.The crucial step in the demonizing of Faust was the publication in German in1587of a book regaling stories of his mischievous magical career; how he conjuredup and made a pact with Devil, and ultimately ended up being torn to pieces byhis satanic master—aWtting end, of course, for all those who dabbled in themagical arts. The1587Faust book fed on the popularity ofteufelsb€ucheror Devil’sbooks in German popular culture during the second half of the sixteenth century.They sold in their thousands, and were mostly Protestant in authorship. Bothhumorous and scary in tone, they related and depicted the Devil’s many ways ofexploiting and ruining sinners. One of them published in1553,Der Zauber TeuVel(The Devil of Magic), which contained a woodcut of a magician conjuring in acircle, directly inXuenced the1587Faust book. Such literature was not unique tothe German states, and so it is no surprise that the sensational tale of Faust was soontranslated into other languages, and disseminated widely in learned and popularculture. The legend’s enduring inXuence was further sealed by the Faust plays ofChristopher Marlowe and Goethe.18Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Faust may have been contemporary magicians butthey were very diVerent characters, with divergent and antagonist positionsregarding the nature and practice of magic. Yet the three of them were tarredwith the same diabolic reputation, and all three would have their names associatedwith grimoires of the darkest magic. Faust’s time would come in the eighteenthcentury. It was the name of Agrippa that found itself on the title page of theWrsttrue grimoire of the print age.New wave, old wavesTheWrst edition ofThe Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy, in Latin, was produced inMarburg in1559, and another edition appeared in Basel six years later.19Subse-quent editions were often printed in theOpera, a collation of real and spuriousworks by Agrippa, along with theHeptameron, andArs Notoria.20Although aformer pupil of Agrippa named Johan Weyer would later protest that theFourthBookhad nothing to do with his late master, for demonologists it was the realthing, the proof that Agrippa had been deep in diabolic magic all the time.2150|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Fig.2First English edition of theFourth Book of Occult Philosophy."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Copies quickly began to circulate across Europe. The Elizabethan mage John Deeowned the1559edition and brought it with him during his travels around centralEurope in1583.22By the late1580s manuscript versions were passing through thehands of less well-connected Italian magicians. A Neapolitan treasure hunternamed Michele Navarra purchased a copy amongst a bundle of magical manu-scripts he bought for the considerable sum of thirty-eight ecus of gold. AnotherNeapolitan was found with a copy along with a manuscript ofClavicule ofSolomon.23One of the charges against a young man prosecuted in Normandy in1627included the possession of a grimoire and ‘asking a student for a book byAgrippa’.24TheWrst English version only appeared in1655, published by the Cambridgeeducated astrologer-physicianRobert Turner. Scholarly magicians would havealready obtained a Latin edition, and so the purchasers of the English text wereprobably a mix of the intellectually curious and professional astrologers andcunning-folk. Its swift notoriety is evident from a1678pamphlet attackingignorant ‘ass-trologers’, ‘piss-prophets’, and ‘starr-wizards’. The author describedthe standard consulting-room decor and accoutrements of such people, advising,‘let your Table be never without some old mustyGreekorArabickauthor, and the4th book ofCornelius Agrippa’s Occult Philosophy, wide open, to amuse spectators.’A decade or so later the clergymanRichard Baxter recorded, ‘I had a very GodlyFriend, that a Week ago told me, that he read Cornelius Agrippa’sOccultaPhilosophia, and read the same Words that he saith will raise Devils.’ This wasalmost certainly theFourth Book, and as his conscientious friend avowedly detestedthe book, ‘nothing appeared to him’. The son of a minister who came to seeBaxter in a state of terror was less fortunate. He had also read a book ofconjurations to make the Devil appear; he duly did, urging the young man toslit his throat.25TheArbatelwas another work included in editions of Agrippa’sOpera, and itappeared in the English edition of theFourth Book of Occult Philosophy. It wasconcerned with the hierarchy, nature, and governance of the spirit world, andwhat the spirits could teach mankind. According to theArbatel, between the years1410and1900the ruling prince of spirits was Hagith who had4,000legions ofspirits under his command. He possessed the knowledge to convert copper intogold, so he was a spirit alchemists were likely to be familiar with. Following onfrom Hagith’s reign, Ophiel is the current governor of the spirit world. He alsohas alchemical powers, but can also make men live to three hundred, and moremodestly he can cure the dropsy. Although editions of theArbatelappearedbearing dates in the early sixteenth century, theWrst edition, in Latin, was actuallyprinted in Basel in1575. German translations were soon circulating in manuscriptform, usually attributing it to Paracelsus. As to its real author we know nothing,52|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"though he was clearly learned in medieval andRenaissance magic and a followerof Paracelsus and Hermeticism. There was also a degree of invention as well asheavy borrowing. It included spirit names unknown in the previous literature thatwouldWnd their way into popular grimoires of the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies.26The publication of theArbatelin Basel scandalized the town’s theologians. Thepastor Simon Sulzer denounced it from his pulpit. Calls were made for the printerto be punished, though there is no evidence that any other action was taken.27In1617senior members of the Protestant University of Marburg investigated thecurriculum being taught at the town’s school by the Paracelsian andRosicrucianschoolmaster Philipp Homagius and his colleague Georg Zimmermann. A searchof their lodgings revealed copies of theArbatelprinted in editions of Agrippa’sOpera, and it transpired that they had even intended to introduce theArbatelas aschool textbook. In his own copy Homagius noted, ‘I wrote this and was happy tocomplete it on4May1617. This book deals with the way how to evoke spirits,and how we may obtain our familiar spirits; amongst their tasks it is to providelongevity and to prolong life by300years.’ A copy was also found on a studentwho was so absorbed in it that for more than a year and a half after having beenexpelled he did not attend any lectures, ‘nor was he inclined to do so’.28ThisWrst wave of print grimoires emanated from Protestant German and Swisspublishing centres such as Frankfurt and Basel. The long arms and beady eyes ofthe papal censors did not reach these Protestant areas. The notoriety of theGermanic mages, Trithemius, Faust, Agrippa, and Paracelsus, would have alsogenerated a keen regional audience. But such occult works were not only ofinterest to practical magicians and the simply curious. A strong mystical, spiritualtradition emerged in Protestantism during the sixteenth century, most notablyexpressed in the inXuential writings of the Lutheran visionary Jacob Boehme(1575–1624), but also evident in numerous other small Protestant sects, such asthose that made their way to America during the late seventeenth century. TheNeoplatonic discourses on the angelic and spiritual hierarchies contained intheArbatel, Heptameron, Book ThreeandFourth Book of Occult Philosophy, and theSteganographia, and the keys they provided to direct celestial communication,appealed to the prophetic and revelatory aspects of Protestant theology.It would be going too far, though, to claim that print revolutionized theEuropean grimoire tradition at this period. It certainly introduced inXuentialnew texts into the canon, signiWcantly increased the pool of available magicalknowledge, and heightened authoritarian concerns over their dissemination andinXuence. Yet the continued power and inXuence of handwritten manuscripts isclearly evident from the fact that, across much of Europe, the number of Latin andvernacular copies of the classic medieval grimoires which remained unpublishedWar against Magic|53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"in the early modern period multiplied many times. Many handwritten copies ofprinted works like theFourth Bookalso circulated. It has been said that the reasonfor this was because printed editions had no intrinsic value, as high magic requiredthe ritualized transcription and consecration of each individual grimoire.29This isundoubtedly a signiWcant factor, but increasing numbers of users were not earnestseekers of magical enlightenment assiduously carrying out the stipulated fastings,consecrations, and other preparations. They just wanted quick-Wx conjurations,and the basic details on what to say and where to say it. Manuscripts still held anaura for these people, and their clients in particular, but ultimately there was nointrinsic diVerence between print or manuscript versions in using the conjurationsthey contained. The fact is that demand for print conjurations outstripped supplyand so manuscripts continued to be produced in their thousands.30We get a good idea of the most popular of the old texts from Inquisition trialsconcerning the search for buried treasure. In Sicily, which was under Spanish ruleand therefore the jurisdiction of the Spanish Inquisition, weWnd that theClaviculeof Solomonand theLucidariusof Peter D’Abano circulated quite widely, andtreasure-seeking priests such as one Antonio Panayno, investigated in the1630s,were instrumental in facilitating the diVusion of such grimoires.31A manuscriptcalled theGabalaRegnumand theClaviculewere found hidden amongst themathematical books of a southern Italian treasure hunter and surveyor prosecutedtwice in the1680s named Nicodemo Salinaro. He told an acquaintance that theycould not only helpWnd treasure but make a man invisible and help him to ‘obtaingrace’.32In the1590s a fraternity of Capuchin friars from Verona were found to becirculating several prohibited books on magic amongst themselves, including theClavicule of Solomonand theCentumRegnum(One Hundred Kings).33The latter,which appeared variously as theForty Three, Fifty,orHundred Kings, consisted of alist of the principal spirits and their powers, in the tradition of theTestament ofSolomon. It was evidently a popular grimoire in Italy at the time, as was noted byseveral Italian inquisitors. A copy was also found in the occult library of a Maltesenotary condemned as a heretic in1574.34In1579the Venetian Inquisition uncovered aWve-man team of treasurehunters led by a nobleman, Giulio Morosoni, who was advised and aided by aformer professor of theology named Father Cesare Lanza. The group madelengthy preparations including the collection of several magic books, amongstthem a copy of theClavicule of Solomonsolemnly consecrated by Cesare Lanza,Agrippa’sDe occulta philosophia, theLucidarioof d’Abano, an unnamed workattributed toRoger Bacon, andThe Forty-Three Kings of Spirits(a version of theCentumRegnum). One of the team, a former friar and priest, Gregorio Giordano,described the latter to the Inquisitors: ‘there was written there on each page thename of a spirit, its powers, its characters, and the methods of conjuring it . . . and54|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"among other things there was one who said after his name ‘‘I am the God ofTreasure’’.’35Not all the team took seriously the solemnity of the ritual magicemployed by Cesare. One of them told the tribunal that during the consecrationof one grimoire Cesare ‘drew the large knife with the right hand and recited thepsalmExurgat Deuswith such vehemence that it seemed he wanted to cut all thespirits into pieces in that one act, whereupon I wanted to start laughing; I wasdying with laughter so that I could hardly contain myself.’ It is possible, of course,that this dismissal of ritual conjuration was an attempt to mitigate his criminalinvolvement.36In Italy theClavicule of Solomonwas clearly the most ubiquitous and widelycirculated grimoire. In early modern Venice versions were available not only inLatin and Italian, but French, English, and German, or a combination of them.The same holds true for Spain, and the copy conWscated from a priest in GranCanaria in1527shows that wherever the Spanish clergy were to be found so towas theClavicule.37That other medieval hit, thePicatrix, circulated less widely,basically because it provided little practical help in conjuring and controllingdemons. TheBook of Honoriuswas popular amongst the practical magicians anddiabolic dabblers of late-seventeenth-century Paris, but otherwise it was nowherenear as widespread as theClavicule.It is important to point out that in the manuscript grimoire tradition few workswere ever quite the same. There was no founding text, no print template for theClaviculefor instance. Over the generations copyists added their own personaltouches, taking bits out, adding information from other sources. Apart from therare cases where copies were kept by the authorities rather than burned, whenevertheClaviculeor other well-known grimoire is mentioned in a trial record weusually have little idea as to what it contained or looked like. Some clearlyfollowed the template of the learned medieval examples. Others might have thename of Solomon on them but were basically magic scrapbooks, compilations ofpractical magic for dealing with witches, causing rain, seducing women, and thelike, culled from manuals of exorcisms, orations, prayers, and oral sources ofknowledge. Some were large, imposing leather-bound parchment tomes, whileothers were cheaply bound paper volumes, pocket-sized for ease of carrying andso that they could be hidden up a sleeve by itinerant cunning-folk.38Similarly, thetrial records do not always distinguish between Agrippa’sOcculta philosophiaandtheFourth Book, or make clear whether they were a print or manuscript version.Innovation and invention continued to occur in the manuscript traditionduring the early modern period. When in1627an Italian Benedictine monknamed Stefano PerandaXed his abbey after hearing he had been denounced to theInquisition he left behind in his cell a manuscript entitledZecorbeni seu claviculaSalomonis.39As the title suggests, and as two eighteenth-century manuscriptsWar against Magic|55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"calledZekerboniin the FrenchBibliothe`que de l’Arsenalshow, although the title wasnovel the contents were basically another variation on theClavicule.40Although itnever became a major player, a small number of copies circulated outside of Italyby the end of the century. As well as the French examples, in1674the Englishantiquarian John Aubrey translated and transcribed an Italian manuscriptZecorbeni,which is now in the Bodleian Library. It has been suggested that Aubrey may havetried out some of its contents.41The most interesting aspect of theZekerboniis that the French copies stated thatthey were written by an early seventeenth-century Milanese doctor and occultistnamed Pierre or Pietro Mora. Attributing books to mythical doctors was part ofthe grimoire tradition, of course, but in this case it was only in the twentiethcentury that the mysterious Mora was given a dubious history by MontagueSummers, a widely read author of populist works on the history of witchcraftand magic. Employing his love of the Gothic, Summers provided a lurid two-pageaccount of ‘this mysterious and menacing personage’ who apparently confessed tothe Inquisition that he was ‘the Grand Master and preceptor of a band of Satanists,who with infernal malice were leagued to spread the pestilence by all means theycould devise’. This account was then taken up by other historians, with oneconcluding from Summers’ account that Mora ‘must have been a Satanist’.42Infact there is no evidence of a Milanese medical man of that name having beenexecuted in Milan for plague-spreading at the time. There was, however, abarber-surgeon named Giovanni Giacomo Mora who was executed in1630after confessing under torture to being part of a plague-spreading conspiracy.Summers seems to have mixed up the two Moras, and then invented the diabolicelement, for Mora was never questioned by the Milanese authorities about satanicworship or magical practices.43As I indicated earlier, manuscript grimoires, particularly those that increasinglycirculated in popular culture, often consisted mostly of the bricolage of oral andprint sources of practical occult knowledge rather than conjurations and endlessspirit descriptions. Astrological almanacs became hugely popular in the seven-teenth century, and their lists of good and bad days, weather forecasts, and usefulproverbs seeped deep into the agricultural world of the common people, and werescribbled into the pages of grimoires. Another very popular print genre was the‘secrets of secrets’ whose natural magic mixed with the demonic in manuscript andlater print grimoires. Well known in the medieval period, and with their contentsrelying heavily on ancient Greek,Roman, and Arabic texts, these expositions of thehidden wonders of nature embodied both the intellectualRenaissance fascinationwith ancient wisdom andWred and informed the popular imagination of anexpanding readership. They were works of magic only in the sense that theyrevealed the secret powers of plants, animals, stones, and the mysterious workings56|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"of natural processes that might otherwise be deemed the result of the magicalactions of magicians or the world of spirits. One popular print example was aversion of theKyranides. A seventeenth-century English edition entitledTheMagick of Kirani King of Persiacontained such priceless information as ‘A Weezle’sTongue dried, and worn in ones shooes, makes all his Enemies to be mute,’ and‘For an Alopecia, or falling of the hair; Apply the ashes of little Frogs with Tar.’Frog was also good for the reverse process, so if you want a painless alternative towaxing, ‘burn the skin of a Frog, and put it into the water of the Bath.’44In the print age, the medieval book of secrets falsely attributed to AlbertusMagnus would prove the most enduring, inXuential, and pervasive,Wnding afollowing across the western hemisphere where it was known to many as theGrand Albert. Several new publications also emerged with similar commercialsuccess, though without the lasting notoriety of the Albertus book. The greatestchallenger was theSecretiof Alessio Piemontese. First printed in Italian and Latinin the1550s, and obviously created to build on the success of Albertus, the prefacetold how Piemontese, aWctional but not unrealistic archetype of theRenaissanceoccult scholar, had gathered his secrets of medicine and nature from his travelsacross Italy and the Middle East. Over the next two centuries various editionsappeared in English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Polish.45Amongstthese false andWctional authors the work of the very real Giambattista Della Porta(1535–1615) stands out. This Italian polymath spent a lifetime exploring thenatural world and occult philosophy.46Like Paracelsus he denounced spiritconjuration but unlike Agrippa he never disavowed natural magic. For his painshe was constantly harassed by the Italian Inquisition. His most celebrated workMagia naturalisorNatural MagicWrst appeared in1558and subsequently wentthrough at least twenty editions. Unlike Albertus and Piemontese,Natural Magicwas intended explicitly for an intellectual readership. While it contained muchthat was similar to the others it also provided learned discourses on subjects likeoptics, and has been characterized by one historian as reading ‘like a manifesto fora new scientiWc methodology: that of science as a venation, a hunt for ‘‘newsecrets of nature.’’’47Nevertheless, with a title containing magic, the ignorant andsuspicious were quick to make assumptions about dealings with the darker arts,and although far from it,Natural Magicwas sometimes considered a work ofdiabolic magic rather than of scientiWc endeavour.Almanacs and books of secrets may have seasoned the grimoire recipe, but themost inXuential occult products of the print age, exorcism manuals, were oftenendorsed by the Catholic Church—at least atWrst. There had always been layexorcists practising a wide range of oral means of dispossession. But the Church’slack of control over the performance of exorcisms was thoroughly exposed in theseventeenth century by the proliferation of lay exorcists and maverick clergymen.War against Magic|57"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Fig.3Notebook of the early eighteenth-century Yorkshire cunning-manTimothy Crowther, containing a mix of conjurations, axioms,weather-signs and astrological calculations."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Catholic Bavaria proved fertile ground for such men and women. One suchpractitioner was a pastor named Johann Weiss, the son of a parish priest, whowas charged by the secular authorities in1579with practising magic. Weiss hadbeen in the business of exorcizing people, many of whom believed they weredriven insane by being possessed by the purgatorial spirits of stillborn children. Onbeing apprehended Weiss was ordered to hand over a suspicious book ostensiblythought to contain blessings for good weather and exorcisms, but which it wassuspected contained more. It could not be found and Weiss claimed he had lostit.48As this case suggests, and others conWrm, a key reason for the proliferation ofsuch unoYcial exorcism was the increasing public access to the many exorcismmanuals in Italian and Latin pouring oVthe presses of Bologna, Milan, and Veniceduring the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.The practice of exorcism, which was condemned by the Protestant churches,was an excellent propaganda tool for the Catholic Church. In his book on theevils of witchcraft, the French judge and demonologist Henri Boguet includedseveral chapters aimed at those who mocked the exorcisms of the priesthood. Itcontained a series of accounts of how French Calvinists (Huguenots) foundthemselves powerless in the face of witchcraft and demonic attack, and endedup having to resort to the Catholic clergy for succour.49Without the power ofexorcism the Protestant clergy had no place on the battleWeld against the Deviland his minions. Yet, as Protestant theologians never tired of pointing out, therewas little or no diVerence between exorcism and conjuration, as both involvedtalking to Devils. The diVerence depended on whether one accepted the holypower invested in the ordained priest.Conjurations were often no more than tweaked versions of the oYcial rites ofexorcism, so it is no wonder that the printed exorcism manuals resembled magicbooks in some respects. ThePractica of Exorcists, for example, written by aFranciscan and published in1586, discussed how the exorcist could communicatewith the demonic spirits in order that their names could be written down above animage of a demon drawn on paper, which should then be burned.The Hammer ofthe Demons(1620) by another Franciscan, Alexander Albertinus, consisted ofpassages of Scripture mixed with prayers and conjurations to command andexpel demons. The most inXuential author of exorcism manuals at this time wasthe Franciscan exorcist Girolamo Menghi, some of whose various popular workswere also published in Frankfurt. He produced a series of books with titles likeTheDevil’s Scourgeand theClub against Demons, some of which were produced inpocket versions, ideal for itinerant lay and ordained exorcists. As inquisitorial andecclesiastical records show, in such hands his manuals were used as grimoires forsuch purposes as treasure seeking and curing impotency.50In1643, for instance, amonk named Zorzi used a copy ofThe Devil’s Scourgeto conjure up rather thanWar against Magic|59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"banish demons and also to consecrate talismans for winning at gambling.51Themid-seventeenth-century exorcism manuals of Candido Brugnoli were central tothe magical practices of a popular Brazilian exorcist and Carmelite friar, Luis deNazare ́, who was charged by the Inquisition in the1740s. Brugnoli attacked thepractice of touching the female genitalia and breasts during exorcisms, but that isexactly what Nazare ́did, even going so far as to copulate with the possessed. TheInquisition banished him to a remote monastery forWve years, forbade him fromforever exorcizing again, but allowed him to remain a priest.52Several of these exorcism manuals, including Menghi’s, were belatedly addedto the papalIndexin1709, but by this time the Church had been complicit inspreading the magical use of exorcisms at the same time as its courts wereattempting to suppress lay and ecclesiastical ‘superstition’.53Print culture also inXuenced the magic tradition through more subtle path-ways. A good example of this is the way in which fairies were incorporated intoboth the ritual conjurations of Tudor English grimoires and the literary cultureof the early modern stage.54In several English sixteenth-century manuscripts weWnd the names of fairies among the demonic and spirit names included inSolomonic conjurations. As one twentieth-century scholar with a jaundicedview of Continental magical traditions put it, ‘It is an extraordinary experienceto follow the dark trail of ritual magic from the Continent (and notably fromGermany) to England, and toWnd oneself escaping from puerility and squalor intopoetry, fairy-tales and romance.’55This highly subjective description wascoloured more by the fairy-lore prominent in Elizabethan and Jacobean dramathan any uniquely poetic quality in English grimoires of the period. The key linkbetween the two literary traditions was theWgure of Oberon, king of the fairies,who was to be found onstage in Shakespeare’sA Midsummer’s Night DreamandBen Jonson’sOberon, the Fairy Prince.Similar sounding spirits had been mentioned in early sixteenth-century Churchcourt records. In1510a priest named JamesRichardson was accused of preparing alead tablet inscribed with the image of a spirit named Oberion. Eighteen yearslater a treasure-seeking monk named William Stapleton confessed to having heardfrom a friend that the parson of Lesingham and Sir John of Leiston had conjuredup three spirits named Andrew Malchus, Inchubus, and Oberion.56By the latesixteenth century surviving grimoires show that Oberion had becomeWrmlyidentiWed as a fairy rather than one of the legions of other spirits and demons.A magic manuscript in the Folger Shakespeare Library includes Oberion amongsta list of eighty-two spirits, and states, ‘he teacheth a man knowledge in phisickeand he sheweth the nature of stones herbes and trees and of all mettall. he is a greatand mighty kinge and he is kinge of the fairies. he causeth a man to be Invissible.he showeth where hiding treseuer is and how to obtain the saime.’ An60|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"early-seventeenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library provides instruc-tions on how to conjure up the fairies and how to call Oberion into a crystal.57The inXuence of Oberon and his transformation into the king of the fairies inthe English grimoire and literary tradition was primarily inXuenced by the trans-lation and printing in1534of a French romance calledHuon of Bordeaux, in whicha fairy king is shrunk to the size of a small child by a curse. TheWgure of Oberonsubsequently developed through the interplay of print and manuscript literature.The playwrights’ conception of ritual magic was inXuenced by their knowledge ofmanuscript grimoires, and, in turn, stage plays fed back into magical culture,exciting interest in calling up the fairies. It is surely the work of Shakespeare andJonson, and their portrayals of Queen Mab, queen of the fairies, which inXuencedthe subsequent reference to her in conjurations. She is mentioned in a seven-teenth-century magical manuscript in the British Library, and the astrologerWilliam Lilly recalled meeting a magician named Mortlack who professed tocall upon Queen Mab via his crystal ball.58Pathways were also opened betweenliterary and oral cultures of magic. TheRevd Thomas Jackson, writing in1625,recalled that during his ministry he questioned a parishioner, ‘an ignorant soule’,who he knew ‘to have beene seduced by a teacher of unhallowed arts, to make adangerous experiment’. When asked whether he thought the Devil was at work ina ritual involving the watching of fern seeds, he replied ‘No; it is in the keeping oftheKing of Fayries, andheI know will doe me no harme.’ The name of the Kingescaped him, however, so Jackson ‘remembred it unto him out of my reading inHuonofBurdeaux’.59DemocratizationAs historians quite rightly revise the ‘newness’ ofRenaissance occultism, the realrevolution has gone largely unremarked—the democratization of high magic.60Print was a key factor in the trickle down of literary magic, as was the growingdissemination of vernacular manuscripts, but both developments were fuelled byan expanding market for literary magic. But who made up this new readership?If monks were the grimoire masters of the medieval period, in the sixteenthcentury they were in competition with the parish clergy. The shockingly poorlevel of education and professionalism of many priests was no secret on the eve oftheReformation. The pattern of clerical education in1500was by no meansuniform, but in the Netherlands only20per cent of the clergy were university-trained and the situation was little better in northern German states. At the sametime literacy had increased in wider society, highlighting more starkly the edu-cational poverty of the priesthood. Church court records from across western andWar against Magic|61"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"southern Europe reveal numerous complaints from parishioners about lax,womanizing, and drunken village priests.The image of such dissolute and ignorant clergymen was a favourite of late-Wfteenth- and early-sixteenth-century cartoonists and satirists like Erasmus. Thewidespread criticism of the parish clergy was certainly a contributory factor in thediscontent that fomented the ProtestantReformation. Church authorities in newlyReformed states knew that the success of theReformation depended on a clergy thatwas educated and conscientious, and surveys and court records showed they werenot in generous supply. In1551the Bishop of Gloucester, England, found168priestsin his diocese could not even repeat the Ten Commandments properly.61TheReformation heralded a major change in the educational status of theparochial clergy, though it took several decades to get going and recruitment wasinitially sluggish.62A programme of clerical retraining and education was at theheart of the strategies of the main Protestant churches. A Danish Church Ordin-ance of1627required all prospective Lutheran ministers to obtain a universitydegree. A study of ministers in the Lutheran German duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb€uttel reveals that, by1630,80per cent were university-trained, thoughnot necessarily obtaining degrees in theology. In England by the same date the vastmajority of Anglican clergymen were also university graduates.63The Catholic Church eventually responded to criticism from both within andwithout, launching its own reformation of clerical piety and behaviour. While theSpanish Crown had forced an overhaul of the clergy in the lateWfteenth century,it was the decrees of the Council of Trent, deliberating between1545and1563,which launched a major renewal of the pastoral activities of the Church. The needfor these Tridentine reforms of clergy and laity was evident to any conscientioussenior clergyman. When, for instance, the Archbishop of Brindisi-Oria toured hisdiocese in southern Italy two years after the Council of Trent, he found that in thetown of Francavilla there were nine priests who kept concubines and the arch-priest could barely read or write. Of nine magical practitioners mentioned twowere clergymen. A survey of the Inquisition records for Modena revealed that theclergy were defendants in20per cent of the trials for ‘superstition’ between1580and1600.64A key Tridentine measure was the setting up of seminaries dedicatedto the education and re-education of the priesthood. The pace of reform wasuneven across Catholic Europe. In the German Catholic prince-bishopric ofM€unster, for instance, a seminary was only instituted in1626but it was at leastsuccessful in producing highly educated priestsXuent in Latin and trained in theart of preaching.65In France the old criticisms about the clergy were still plentifulin the early seventeenth century.66What has this to do with grimoires? The fact that by the early seventeenthcentury the majority of clergy had access to university or monastic libraries as part62|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"of their training meant that they had more opportunity to consult and transcribeworks on the occult sciences. Furthermore, a better-educated parish clergy alsomeant a clergy better able to read, understand, and employ the ritual conjurationscontained in grimoires. While even semi-literate Catholic clergy had an advantagein the magical market through their exploitation of consecrated items and theirordained status, the ability to exploit literary magic and employ the numerousLatin exorcism manuals now available—as well as fully understand the LatinVulgate—would have further enhanced their status amongst the laity. A bettereducated priesthood did not mean a better paid priesthood. There had been asigniWcant increase in the number of parish priests in some parts of Europe, andwhile the wealth of the secular clergy varied widely many were poor and poorlytrained. It is no wonder, as one historian has suggested, that many members of this‘ecclesiastical proletariat’ were tempted to use their educational advantage toexplore the money-making possibilities of magic.67The sixteenth century also saw the expansion and opening up of other profes-sions, such as schoolteachers, doctors, lawyers, and military men, which generatednew circles of educated magical adepts.68A good example of this comes from theMaltese Inquisition’s investigation in1582of how a local doctor named GaleazzoCademusto came to transcribe a book of necromancy. It transpired that a Nea-politan schoolteacher owned the original copy. On being sentenced to a spell inthe galleys, he had passed it on to his pupil, the brother-in-law of a lawyer.69Withregard to the ownership of grimoires and the practice of literary magic the medicalprofession were, perhaps, the most inXuential after the priesthood. Until thesecond half of the seventeenth century astrology was a widely accepted andpractised component of the medical sciences, and was sometimes a gateway toexperimentation in the magical arts. This is clearly evident from the lives of severalwell-known English astrologer-physicians. Copies of medieval texts such as thePicatrixwere found in the libraries of the likes of Simon Forman andRichardNapier.70Versions of theClaviculealso circulated, though sometimes under othertitles. A disreputable Tudor astrologer-physician named Gregory Wisdom inher-ited a mysterious book from his father described as a ‘book in English called thePractice of Dammell’. It no longer survives but a manuscript of Solomonicconjurations from the period begins with the similar rubric ‘Here beginneth thebook which is called the Dannel’.71The diaries of Simon Forman (1552–1611), a very successful London astrol-oger-physician, who had his books conWscated on a couple of occasions, provide arare insight into how such men considered and dabbled in spirit conjurationalongside their more respectable occult pursuits. Forman possessed manuscriptsof theArs Notoria, Picatrix, andLiberRaziel, and made copies of several of them. Inthe late1580s he began in earnest to contact spirits, and in1590noted that heWar against Magic|63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"‘wrote a bocke of nigromanti’ and had ‘entred a cirkell for nicromanticall spells’.He made at least one other copy of his grimoire, presumably to enhance its power.He even dreamed about magic books and in one he ‘was sore trobled about hidingof my bocks’.72By no means all early modern astrologers were magicians. The astrological andmagical arts were not inseparable, and some astrologers condemned magic out-right and not just conjuration. Nevertheless, many theologians suspected other-wise and ‘scientiWc’ astrologers were vulnerable to accusations of sorcery. In1622Patrick Sinot, an Irish Professor ofRhetoric at the University of Santiago, wasaccused of possessing books of necromancy containing magical signs, circles, andcharacters, though the evidence suggests his library was purely astrological andperhaps Kabbalistic. Similarly in1608the Catalonia tribunal charged theastrologer Joseph Sala with practising sorcery and incantations, though the onlyforbidden book they found was a copy of an inXuential treatise by the thirteenth-century Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti.73The clearest sign of the democratization process was the possession of magicbooks by artisans, tradesmen, apothecaries, and craftsmen, men who, in the earlymodern period, usually had an education and an increasing degree of social andgeographical mobility. This is exempliWed by a magical healer named NicolasNoel le Bragard, from the town of Nancy, in eastern France. In1593he told hisprosecutors, no doubt under torture, how he came to practise magic. Bragard hadbegun his working life as a cobbler, and then been a soldier. He was educated andknew a little Latin. He said he knew nothing of magic books until one day he sawan acquaintance, one of the town’s gatekeepers, with ‘a book containing variousrecipes, such as toWnd lost property, to have oneself loved by and to enjoywomen, and others he did not well remember, which made him envious toacquire that science.’ He tore several pages out of the book but desired to knowmore. A soldier of his acquaintance possessed another such book but would notlend it to him. Then he came across a woman who owned some old magic booksand papers kept in a chest. He bought them from her, transcribed them and thensold them on to a gentleman. He also claimed to have seen a book entitledD’occulta philosophia, which he said he thought was theFourth Book. He hadtried out a variety of magical rituals contained in his grimoires for ‘enjoying awoman’, detecting stolen property, andWnding treasure, but the results had beengenerally disappointing.74In1623the authorities in Moulins, a town in central France, arrested andinterrogated a similar character named Jean Michel Menuisier who stood accusedof witchcraft and making a tacit pact with the Devil. He was a practising magicianin hisWfties who, after having been sentenced to banishment in1604for invokingevil spirits, said he had travelled in England, Germany, and Spain, where he stayed64|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"in Toledo—a fact that immediately aroused suspicion. During a visit to Vienna hehad purchased a magic phial containing a spirit named Boe ̈l, which he consultedto know occult secrets and therefore help his clients. As well as practising illegalmedicine he confessed that with an accomplice, an apothecary called Sanglant, hehad called up spirits and angels includingRaphael toWnd lost treasures. Thelengthy transcript of his interrogation reveals how the authorities were preoccu-pied withWnding out his knowledge of grimoires. He admitted to possessing acopy of Agrippa’sOpera, and was questioned whether he was familiar with theFourth Book of Occult Philosophy. Asked whether he knew Latin he replied in thenegative. His interrogator repeatedly brought up the names of grimoires evidentlyof most concern to the authorities. Did Menuisier use theElementa magicaof ‘pitride appono’ (Peter d’Abbano)? No. What about a book called theArbatel? Not thateither, though in further evidence he or Sanglant admitted to knowing fourinvocations from it. TheArs Notoria? No. He was clearly well versed in grimoiremagic though, and confessed his knowledge of theClavicula Salomonisand wasasked about theSalomonis Lemegethan. He had also used a virgin parchmentmanuscript called thePhilippus Attinius onoriusconsecrated to an angel namedAvenel. This was obviously a copy of theSworn Book of Honoriusfor in reference toit Menuisier mentioned the assembly of all the magicians in Athens. Towards theend of his interrogation he explained that when magic had been taught publicly inToledo the Spanish Jews had assigned the authorship of magic books to St Paul,St Barnabe ́, St Leon, Charlemagne, and Albert le Grand, as well as to Abel, Enoch,and Abraham. Menuisier was hung and burned for his crimes.75Vernacular grimoires also penetrated further down the social scale, thoughrarely to labourers and unskilled workers for reasons of cost and literacy. Sheepand cattle herders had a particular reputation for medical skills and magical powersdue in part to their solitary, peripatetic lifestyle, and close relationship to thenatural and therefore the occult world.76In Normandy there were a series of trialsinvolving shepherds accused of stealing the Eucharist for magical purposes andother magical practices.77A wedding prank inRouen had dire consequenceswhen the bride’s brother, a shepherd, decided to put on a public performanceof the ligature, a well-known impotence spell involving the knotting of a piece ofcord. As part of the mock ritual his accomplice, a pharmacist named EtienneMoreau, then made a show of counteracting the ligature with magic read from agrimoire. The authorities got wind of what had happened and arrested Moreau.They found in his possession ‘a bad book containing many recipes and magicalsigns’, a paper covered with strange symbols, and ‘four pieces of virgin parchmentcontaining invocations of evil spirits’.78While herders were not high up the list of literate occupations in the early modernperiod, and occupationally they did not usually require any education other than theWar against Magic|65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ability to count, the literate shepherd was aWgure of respect. The vegetarian andmystic Thomas Tryon (1634–1703) learned to read from shepherds, and havingtended sheep in his childhood he noted the wisdom of the shepherd over the learnedgent. The ‘Shepherd and Husbandman understand something of Nature; but most ofthe Learned are departed from the simple ways of God in Nature, putting out theirown Eyes, and then boasting what Wonders they can see with other Mens.’79Thememoirist and one-time excise oYcer John Cannon recalled how during hischildhood in the late seventeenth century he had befriended a self-taught shepherdwho introduced him to the magical arts of conjuring spirits and possessed occultbooks including Agrippa’sOccult Philosophy, most likely theFourth Book.80There is no doubt that across Europe more and more women had access to bookknowledge considered to be the rightful preserve of men. Protestantism may haveencouraged the limited education of girls, but the general educated consensus wasthat their reading material should be restricted much more than men’s. In certaincircumstances women and books were seen as a toxic mix. This is certainlyapparent in the realm of medicine. Women had always played an important roleas simple healers, and it was accepted that they had some natural medical instincts interms of midwifery, though that was being undermined at the time by theprofessionalization of the medical establishment. The idea of women of humbleorigin practising medicine informed by literary texts was far less acceptable. Thiswas undoubtedly increasingly happening, though, and the rather sparse evidence ofit suggests that female healers were usually obtaining their book knowledge frommale practitioners. Amongst the few cases of magical healers prosecuted in easternFrance weWnd one illiterate woman who said a surgeon for whom she workedgave her a large piece of paper containing pictures of various herbs.81ConsiderTempel Anneke, a healer and diviner from near the city of Brunswick, in theLutheran state of Lower Saxony, who was beheaded and burned in1664after beingtortured into confessing to diabolic witchcraft. Anneke, a widow living with herfarmer son, had been to school and could read. Her medical knowledge derivedfrom several herbal books in her possession, from shepherds and cowherds, andfrom her mother who had been a maid to a barber and medical man.82Similar pathways of transmission also enabled women to access grimoires. In1739a treasure-hunting schoolmaster’s daughter, who lived near Stuttgart, con-fessed that a Capuchin monk had shown her a book written by Jesuits thatprovided instructions on how to summon a ‘treasure man’.83Anne Bodenham,a Wiltshire cunning-woman executed for witchcraft in1653, claimed to havebeen instructed in the ways of ritual magic from her time as the servant to thenotorious and inXuential Jacobean astrologer-physician John Lambe, who wasmurdered by a London mob in1628. Another seventeenth-century Englishcunning-woman claimed to have obtained her treasure-seeking knowledge66|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"from William Lilly.84Whether this was true or not, the point is that they felt itnecessary to broadcast their relations with well-known male practitioners and theaccess that had given them to literary magic. Some prostitute-magicians also hadopportunities to draw on the grimoires possessed by their regular clients. Take, forexample, Gioanna La Siracusana, who had a relationship with the Maltese militaryengineer Vittorio Cassar, who, during the early seventeenth century, balanced hislay membership of the Order of St John with rakish behaviour and magicalpractices. Cassar possessed several prohibited magic manuscripts including theClavicule of Solomonand a work by Peter d’Abano, which he said he had obtainedfrom a brass-worker and friend in Messina. He had also learned Arabic from aMoorish slave who had oVered to teach him astrological invocations and necro-mancy. Gioanna, who claimed she was illiterate, said she knew Cassar had booksand writings on magic and kept them in his home, but said she did not know whatthey contained. Once Cassar got wind of the Inquisition’s interest in his activitieshe hid his books and sent Gioanna to Naples on a trip so that the inquisitors wouldnot be able to interrogate her.85This was a wise decision. Women were thoughtless able to resist the wiles and seductions of devils, and their mere propinquity togrimoires was enough to entangle them in Satan’s web. In Cotentin, Normandy,in1599, a governess named The ́re`se de Brye claimed to be persecuted by spirits.On one occasion she said a demon in the form of a big black man had come downthe chimney and mistreated her. The suspicion that she was not a victim to bepitied but mixed up in diabolic sorcery was conWrmed when it was found she hadbeen in contact with aClavicule de Solomonand a text calledlivret des Cavernes deTole`de(Little Book of the Toledo Caves).86With grimoires increasinglyWltering down to the social level of cunning-folk,who provided numerous magical services to assuage the illnesses, fears, misfor-tunes, and desires of the general populace, it is not surprising that literary magiccame to be an increasingly important component of popular magic. The contentsof some of the grimoires with their Latin, Greek, and Hebrew names were onlypartially understood by many cunning-folk, who mostly came from the artisan,craftsmen tier of society. So in the early modern period the great grimoires ofritual magic were often not being used for ritual conjuration but as sources forsymbols, phrases, and lists of holy and demonic names. Cunning-folk tookextracts and snippets to construct written protective charms for popular consump-tion. In the process they took elements of learned magic out of their ritual contextand repackaged them for completely diVerent purposes. In sixteenth-centuryVenice, for instance, scraps of paper or parchment with brief conjurations,symbols, circles, and pentacles taken from theClaviculewere commonly possessedas protective talismans.87War against Magic|67"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Demonologists and debunkersConcerns about the dangerous spread of grimoires were expressed by intellectualsfrom across Protestant and Catholic Europe. King James I and VI of England andScotland warned the readers of hisDæmonologieagainst the evils of theFourth Bookof Occult Philosophy.88The French judge Jean Bodin denounced Agrippa’s work,real and false, as the ‘detestable poison of witchcraft’.89Writing in1595anotherFrench witch hunter, NicolasRe ́my, stated that ‘Agrippa, Pierre d’Abano andPicatrix, three masters in damnable magic, have left more prescriptions than isnecessary for the good of men.’90Amongst his warnings to pastors about ‘super-stitious’ practices, the German Protestant theologian Josua Arndius (1626–86)included the use of blasphemous books of magic ascribed to Solomon.91TheJesuit theologian Martı ́n DelRio believed the spread of grimoires generated twotypes of implicit diabolic pacts. TheWrst occurred ‘when someone knowingly andwillingly uses those superstitious signs usually employed by magicians, which hegets either from books or from conversations with magicians’. The second when‘people who, in good faith, read superstitious books, thinking they are byreputable philosophers and physicians.’92Still, there was no unanimous agreement that the possession of grimoiresconstituted an act of heresy. DelRio stated that bishops did not have authority toburn magic books. They were to be handed over to inquisitors to judge whetherthey were heretical rather than merely blasphemous. This sometimes led toacrimonious disputes. In the1520s the Archbishop of Toulouse clashed with theInquisition over the right to try a doctor and suspected sorcerer named Nicolas deBeaumont. At issue was whether Beaumont’s alleged sorcery was truly hereticaland therefore under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Under Canonical Lawheresy constituted a transgression of the articles of Faith and the sacraments of theChurch. Not all acts of magicWtted this. Beaumont had been found with books ofmagic and diabolic invocations, pieces of mandrake, and small humanWgurines. Tothe Inquisition this certainly smacked of explicit Satanic relations—an obviousheresy. But the Archbishop’s lawyer argued that there was a distinction betweenadoration of the Devil and his invocation. Beaumont’s paraphernalia indicated thelatter, which did not constitute a heresy unless a pact could be proven. Unfortu-nately we do not know the ruling of the adjudicatingParlementof Toulouse.93Demonological discourses sometimes provide historians with valuable insightsinto the content and use of grimoires. As DelRio explained in hisInvestigations intoMagic, he decided to bring ‘to light some of the most abstruse material from thebooks of the magicians themselves, thus revealing their vanity, their perWdy, andtheir madness’.94Without the religious authority of someone like DelRio,discussing magic, even with the intent of exposing its worthlessness, could be68|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"interpreted as an act of reinforcing and spreading magical knowledge. JacquesFerrand’s medical discourse on the cause, diagnosis, and cure ofmelancholieerotique, or lovesickness, which was published in1610, fell foul of the Church inthis way. As part of his survey Ferrand, a respected physician and lawyer, providednumerous details of spells and charms used to cause impotency, provoke love, andother related matters. Although he condemned such practices as a matter ofcourse, he was denounced ten years after its publication by the Toulouse Churchtribunal for teaching occult abominations and perniciously spreading magic, andcopies of his book were ordered to be burned.95Those demonologists who expressed scepticism regarding the reality of witch-craft, and concern over the innocent lives being wasted by the zealotry of witchhunters like DelRio, Bodin, andRe ́my, could be equally vitriolic in theirdetestation of grimoires and the users of grimoires. In hisDe præstigiis dæmonum,Wrst published in1563, Johann Weyer (1515–88), a Protestant Dutch physicianand former pupil of Agrippa, devoted a chapter to identifying and denouncing thethree principal printed grimoires of the period. Considering his close relationshipwith Agrippa, he unsurprisingly attacked the spuriousFourth Book of OccultPhilosophy, describing it as ‘pure nonsense, an undone broom with straws scatteredeverywhere. You can make nothing of it, even if you are an enthusiastic student ofthis vanity.’ TheHeptameronof Peter d’Abano was described as a ‘pestilential littlebook’, which ‘should be consigned to Vulcan, among the books that may not beread’, while theArbatelwas dismissed as ‘full of magical impiety’.96In order todemonstrate the fallacy of charms, spells, exorcisms, and talismans, Weyer de-scribed various formulae, rites, and rituals against witches, demons, and ill-health.This, along with his Protestantism and scepticism, attracted considerable oppro-brium fromReformed as well as Catholic demonologists. The Catholic Churchforbade his book, and the likes of Jean Bodin accused him of spreading magic.There was an element of veriWable truth in this. The1583edition ofDe præstigiisdæmonumincluded an appendix called thePseudomonarchia daemonum, which was acatalogue of the hierarchy of demons, their powers, and the means of adjuringthem to appear. This was essentially a version of the manuscript lists of demonsthat circulated, like theLiber centum, though without any signs or characters. Itderived from a manuscript seen by Weyer called the ‘Book of the OYces ofSpirits’, a copy of which Trithemius had in his library. Weyer also mentions seeingan ‘abominable manuscript which richly deserved to be burned’ in the home of aninXuential nobleman.97Whatever the original source, thisWrst printed list ofdemons represented a valuable magical resource, and circulated amongst learnedspirit conjurers.98A slightly altered English version ofPseudomonarchiawas published a year laterby the Elizabethan scepticReginald Scot in his attack on the fallacies of witchcraft,War against Magic|69"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"magic, and the Catholicism he believed inspired them. Scot, a rather unusualdemonological writer in that he was not a clergyman, lawyer, or physician,propounded a rationalist view of religion that went beyond Weyer’s own morecautious view on diabolic intervention. Yet Scot’sDiscoverie of Witchcraftwas atreasure trove of magical information, providing spells, Catholic prayers, exor-cisms, charms, talismans, and rituals on how to communicate with angels, de-mons, and the spirits of the dead. There were detailed instructions on conjuringup treasure and how to enclose a spirit in a crystal. One of Scot’s main sources wasa manuscript grimoire written in red and black ink entitled ‘Secretum secretorum,The secret of secrets’. It was evidently used by two cunning-men rather than anoccult philosopher. At the beginning of the book was the statement that it was‘invented and devised for the augmentation and maintainance of their living, forthe ediWeng of the poore, and for the propagating and inlarging of Gods glorie’.99So Scot produced what amounted to theWrst grimoire printed in the Englishlanguage, and while he did so to prove the worthlessness of its contents heunwittingly ended up democratizing ritual magic rather than undermining it.Not long after its publication, the practical magic and protective Catholic prayersit contained were being transcribed and incorporated into manuscript gri-moires.100TheDiscoverie’s role as a grimoire was further deliberately enhancedby the addition of a ‘Discourse on Devils and Spirits’ to an edition printed in1665.During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries copies of theDiscoveriewerebeing used as source books by cunning-folk and, as we shall see in a later chapter,there is evidence that treasure hunters in America also employed it.101The witch trialsThe evidence of the witch trials does not support the demonologists’ worriesconcerning the explicit relationship between grimoires, witchcraft, and diabolism.From a historical perspective this is hardly surprising. The vast majority of thoseprosecuted and executed for witchcraft were innocent of the crimes they werealleged to have committed. Furthermore, the practices of those guilty of actuallyattempting harmful magic, the vast majority illiterate, were mostly reliant on thestore of oral knowledge regarding image magic and the like: books were notrequired to perform simplemaleWcium. That said, books were found on a smallpercentage of the relatively few cunning-folk who found themselves prosecutedfor witchcraft under harsh secular laws, rather than appearing before ecclesiasticalcourts that dealt with the lesser crime of ‘superstition’. There are a couple of casesin the Scottish trial records. One of them was a healer named Bartie Patersoune,who used herbal remedies, healing waters, and charms to cure sickness and70|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"counter bewitchment. Some of these spells and remedies were written in amanuscript which contained a SATORAREPO word square, occult diagrams,and symbols. He was executed in1607for ‘the crime of sorcery and witchcraft, inabusing of the people with charms and diverse sorts of inchantments, andministering, under the form of medicine, of poisonable drinks’.102In the Swedishwitch trial records there are also very few references to magic books. Likewise, astudy of the records in the Alpine Jura region revealed ‘practically no tracesanywhere . . . of magicians taking their recipes directly from books’. In otherparts of eastern France a few cases have been found. There was a doctor fromGray, Franche-Comte ́, charged in1606for, amongst other crimes, having booksof magic in his house, and a former executioner of Neuchaˆtel who in1668admitted copying ‘charms and diabolical practices’ from a Gothic-lettered printedbook dated1602.103This was almost certainly a German edition of Agrippa’sOpera.The one place in Europe where grimoires did feature prominently in the witchtrials was Iceland. Around134trials are known to have occurred in this formerDanish territory, and nearly a third of them involved grimoires, written spells, orrunes and symbols derived from them.104Those fortunate enough not be exe-cuted wereXogged while the pages of their magic manuscripts were burned undertheir noses.105As surviving examples from the period show, the grimoires beingused in this northern outpost of European culture consisted of a very distinctiveblend of Continental magic, with borrowings from Solomonic texts and the like,and the Nordic runic tradition. There are even some references to Norse pagandeities. Take, for example, the runic farting spell found in a seventeenth-centurygaldrabo ́kor grimoire that had evidently passed through several generations. Itinstructed the reader to write a series of runic symbols in blood on white calfskin,which are to aZict your belly with great shitting and shooting pains, andall these may aZict your belly with very great farting. May your bonessplit asunder, may your guts burst, may your farting never stop, neitherday nor night. May you become as weak as theWend, Loki, who wassnared by all the gods. In your mightiest name Lord God, Spirit, Creator,O ́ðinn, þ\u0002or, Savior, Freyr, Freyja, Oper, Satan, Beelzebub, helper,mighty God, you who protect your followers Uteos, Morss, Nokte,Vitales.In1656J\u0002on J\u0002onsson, who was burned to death for sorcery along with his father,admitted carving such farting runes and sending them to a girl. A search of theirhouses turned up some grimoires and magical writings, and amongst the crimesfor which they were convicted J\u0002onsson confessed to using a Solomonic sign tocure one of his calves that had been aZicted by the Devil.106War against Magic|71"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Another distinctive aspect of the Icelandic experience is that only ten of the128people known to have been tried by the island’s highest court were women.107This is extraordinary considering that in Denmark and Norway, and in Iceland’ssouthern neighbour, Scotland, the vast majority were female.108One explanationfor this emerges from a comparison with Finland where the majority of accusedwere also men, in contrast with trials in the homeland of its Swedish rulers. Maybethe Norwegian settlers who came to Iceland from the late ninth century onwardsbrought with them strong elements of the male shamanic cultures of the Saami,which continued to shape the magical tradition of Finland and northern Scandi-navia into the early modern period.109We need to be clear though, that althoughaccusations of simple harmful witchcraft (rather than full-blown Continentaldiabolism) were usually the basis of the accusations in Iceland, most of thoseaccused were not witches but rather cunning-folk orfj€olkynngisfo ́lk(‘wise people’).The shaman connection may have some mileage, but Iceland’s magic was basedmuch more on literary magic than that of the ‘shamanistic’, spirit-inspired tradi-tions of Finland. So why did book magic assume such importance?Iceland had one of the most impressive literacy rates in early modern Europe,thanks in part to the comparative ease with which the Lutheran church controlledand educated a small, albeit dispersed population. The enduring relevance of theisland’s impressive medieval literary tradition of the sagas and poetry has also beencited as an inXuence.110Maybe the strength of the grimoire tradition rests on thissuccessful programme of education, and the consequent ability of the vast majorityof men on the island to explore and exploit literary magic for personal as well ascommercial gain. On several occasions in the seventeenth century school pupilswere expelled for dabbling with grimoires.111Then again, literacy rates wereequally impressive in Sweden, and as we have seen magic books were compara-tively uncommon in the trials there. So, the importance of rune magic, eVectivethrough the act of depiction, may have also generated a strong tradition of writingmagic in Icelandic popular culture. For both reasons, when neighbourly accusa-tions of witchcraft formed, the involvement of literary means of inXicting harmfulmagic would more likely be suspected than elsewhere in Europe’s villages.TheWrst person to be sentenced for witchcraft inReformation Iceland was aminister named Oddur Gottska ́lksson, who was found guilty of rape supposedlyinspired by the magic contained in grimoires found in his possession. Over acentury later theReverend A ́rni J\u0002onssonXed the country and sailed to Englandafter six parishioners accused him and another man of practising harmful magic.112Across Europe, clergymen are similarly occasionally to be found amongst thoseaccused of witchcraft. In western France the fear of priests employing an impo-tence spell known as thenouement de l’aiguillette(knotting of the cord) duringmarriage ceremonies was deeply engrained in popular culture. In1632a72|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"clergyman of Azay-le-Bruˆle ́was repeatedly accused of the crime by a frustratedmarried couple, and in1650another priest was charged with the crime and fordemanding fees for countering the spell. A few years later a priest took out adefamation suit after similar accusations.113It did not take much for such accusations to become full-blown cases ofwitchcraft attracting judicial interest from ardent witch hunters. So it is notsurprising that a clutch of French witch trials concerned the French priesthoodand their grimoires. The French judge Pierre de Lancre gave considerable thoughtto the problem of these ‘witch priests’. He had triedWve of them himself insouthwest France and noted that three others hadXed to Spain and Navarre beforehe could get his hands on them. He also related the trial of Pierre Aupetit, avillage priest in Limousin, who in1598confessed under torture to attending awitches’ sabbat: ‘he took a certain book there that he read, a book he had laterburned, fearing the authorities. The book was written as a printed text, withstrange words that he did not understand at all.’114In1603a scandalous Nor-mandy priest named Godevent was sentenced to be hanged and burned. Amongsthis crimes were the use of a magic mirror forWnding lost goods, the possession of abooklet of twelve toWfteen pages used for countering spells, and a virgin parch-ment inscribed with magical characters and invocations to call up devils.115Another sensational trial concerned Louis Gaufridy, the priest of a parish nearMarseille, who was executed in1611for ‘kidnapping, seduction, impiety, magic,witchcraft and other abominations’. The case was one of several scandalousFrench possession and exorcism cases involving nuns, where the accusations ofwitchcraft were caught up in a swirl of political and religious intrigue. One of thenuns, the daughter of a local nobleman, speaking on her own behalf and that ofthe twenty-four demons tormenting her, identiWed Gaufridy as the witch respon-sible for her plight. These demons told her exorcists that Gaufridy kept a library ofmagic books in his rooms. Acting on this diabolic tip-oV, his premises weresearched but nothing suspect was found. Later, languishing in prison, he confessedto trying to wed the nun to the Devil and of attending a witches’ sabbat. As to hisalleged magic books, he said he had burned the one he owned and the ashes couldstill be found in the grate.116Suspicious mindsThe democratization of grimoires through the circulation of print and vernacularmanuscripts, the growth of literacy, and social mobility occurred despite theconcerted attempts to control the book trade. As early as1475the Pope gave alicence to the University of Cologne to censor printers, publishers, authors, andWar against Magic|73"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"readers.117This tendency accelerated rapidly during theReformation period, withsecular and religious authorities across Europe producing lists of prohibited booksto prevent the spread of heresies and limit the inXuence of non-Christian reli-gions. By far the most inXuential, though, were the papalIndexes of ProhibitedBooksproduced from1559onwards. The1559Indexfollowed a Venetian listproducedWve years earlier in banning works of geomancy, hydromancy, pyro-mancy, and necromancy, but then broadened out to cover all magic arts alongwith chiromancy, physiognomy, and other branches of divination. Of thosebooks speciWcally mentioned, the most pertinent to our study were theClaviculeof Solomon, already condemned in the VenetianIndex, the books of Hermes, andthe works of Agrippa. A1586papal bull of Sixtus V further reinforced thecensorship of books on judicial astrology.118As one historian has pointed out,though, these publishedIndexeswere probably counter-productive in that theyserved to inform and excite public interest in the very books of magic they weremeant to suppress.119It is possible that the booming market for theClaviculeinearly modern Italy was fuelled in part by its explicit mention in theIndexes.In1559the Spanish Inquisitor General Don Fernando de Valde ́s ordered thepublication of theWrst of numerous Spanish editions of theIndex, which followedthe papal template closely and included eight Latin works on astrology, Kabbalah,and the occult sciences.120The Spanish Inquisition generated the reputation asbeing the most ruthless persecutor and censor of books. Some early historians havedepicted it as being so inXuential that it retarded Spanish intellectual life until thenineteenth century.121But it was not as eVective as some have depicted it, as someinquisitors pointed out at the time.During theWrst few decades of its existence the Spanish Inquisition was mostlyconcerned with rooting out heresy amongstconversos—that is, Jews converted,mostly forcibly, to Christianity. For the inquisitors the possession of Jewish textswas a sure sign thatconversoswere secretly practising Judaism, and so a ruthlesscampaign of rooting out and burning such books was instituted. As recordsshow, their owners secreted them down wells and buried them in gardens in orderto evade the Inquisition and the neighbours who spied for it. Yet despite all theirattentions the Inquisition could not prevent Jewish texts being smuggled in fromItaly and the Netherlands.122While the Italian Inquisition was primarily set up tocounter the threat of Protestantism from over the Alps, it also targeted Jews and theirbooks. In1553many thousands of Hebrew works were destroyed in an orgy of bookburning across the Italian states. Fifteen years later in Venice, a major centre of Jewishpublishing, the authorities instituted another round-up and burned thousands morecopies of the Talmud and other Jewish texts. This occurred despite the fact that theIndex of Prohibited Booksissued in1564had permitted the Talmud, albeit in anexpurgated form and as long is it was not explicitly entitled the Talmud.12374|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The campaign against Jewish books was not only about the heresy of convertedJews secretly practising Judaism, but also about their perceived and real magicalactivities. For many Christians as well as Jews, Hebrew words were in themselvesthought magical, and so for Catholic and Protestant theologians they wereobvious pollutants of the Christian faith. In1529the Spanish Franciscan Martı ́nde Castan ̃ega warned,It is vanity, lack of faith, superstition, and even a judaizing trick to use thename of the ancient Hebrew in Catholic and Christian invocations as ifthe old names were worth more than the new ones. They are especiallydangerous for those with little knowledge, because they may say otherunknown and diabolical words with those Hebrew and Greek ones.124In fact, to expunge potent Hebrew holy names from the Christian vocabularywould have required the censoring of many Catholic exorcisms. The Hebrewmagic word AGLA, for example, which is an acrostic of the phrase ‘You aremighty forever my Lord’, was used in numerous Catholic exorcisms, includingthose of Menghi, as well as being a common magical name in grimoires. It was thissynergy that inspired Martin Luther to lump together and denounce the ‘wordmagic’ of witches, Muslims, Catholics, and Jews.125Suspicions about the use of Hebrew texts emerged in the early seventeenth-century French court intrigue that led to the execution for witchcraft of Le ́onoraGaligaı ̈, one of Maria de Medici’s ladies-in-waiting. Her friendship with aPortuguese Jewish doctor and occultist named Philothe ́e Montalto was consid-ered highly suspect. It was alleged that she had talked at length with him regardingthe magic and talismans contained in Hebrew ‘grimoires’ that had been found athis home. She denied the charge but to no avail.126There were, of course, Jewishcunning-folk just as there were Christian and Islamic ones, each using theirrespective religious texts for healing, divination, and making protective charms.Written amulets have been described as constituting ‘the most powerful elementsof Jewish magic’. Their contents were not necessarily Kabbalistic. They usuallyreferred to the angels, and contained biblical quotes, pentacles, hexagrams,zah-lenquadratsor magic squares, and pentagrams. Here is one brief example that wasto be written on parchment in order to win favour:Hasdiel at my right, Haniel at my left,Rahmiel at my head, angels, let meWnd favour and grace before all men, great and small, and before all ofwhom I have need, in the name of Yah Yah Yah Yau Yau Yau YahZebaot. Amen Amen Amen Selah.127They were, then, very similar to non-Jewish written charms, but the fact theywere written in Hebrew was their unique selling point for Christians. In1643War against Magic|75"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Domenico Temponi told the Venetian tribunal that a Jew had taught him that toWnd hidden treasure he should write Hebrew words on a piece of paper and placeit under the wing of a white cockerel.128Where Jews were allowed to practisetheir faith, as in the Venetian ghetto, Christians also consulted them. Take IsaccoLevi, for instance, a Venetian Jew accused by several Catholics of detecting stolenproperty by magical means. One said he had seen in Levi’s room books of magicincluding a work by the medieval Spanish mysticRaymond Lull, the Proverbs ofSolomon, and most curiously a Kabbalistic manuscript attributed to Pope UrbanVIII. Levi was also accused of making copies for sale. The Inquisition called in aconverted Jew to assess the content of the books and manuscripts they conWscatedfrom Levi, and he concluded that none of them were openly magical.129A Jew practising magic was not heresy but a converted Jew doing likewise wasa quite diVerent matter, and of great interest to the Inquisition. One who came totheir attention was a poor, restless convert called Giovanni Battista Bonaventura,who was tried for heretical blasphemy in1632. He had converted to Islam beforethen converting to Christianity, leaving his Jewish wife in the ghetto. Giovanniwas another of those many men dissatisWed with their modest place in life andwho desired a way to instant wealth. Before his baptism he had confessed to theoYciating priest that he had wanted toWnd treasure, and handed over a basketfulof magic books and writings to be burned. He also admitted to owning some ‘littlebooks’ in Hebrew on astrology, dreams, and medicine. Fortunately the Inquisi-tion decided he was no heretic and he was given a spiritual rather than corporalpunishment for his religious vanities.130The Spanish Inquisition continued tokeep its eye on such people right to the end of its existence. In1776the Barcelonatribunal investigated a weaver named Juan Soler accused of being a ‘heretic,stained with Judaism because of the Hebrew words he combines with conjur-ations’.131Moriscos, that is, converted Moors, were another heretical ‘enemy within’ thatpreoccupied the Spanish Inquisition in particular. The possession of any sort ofArabic texts led to suspicions of secret Islamic worship. The tribunal of Saragossaalone investigated nearly one hundredmoriscosfor carryingalherceson their person.These were small pieces of paper or parchment containing verses from the Koranthat served as protective talismans.132Whether this proved they were practisingIslam is another matter, for Spanish Christians also employedalherces. Due to itsgeographic position and naval importance in the Mediterranean, Malta wasanother region where Arabic magic permeated Christian society. There werearound3,000Muslim slaves on the island at the end of the sixteenth century, duelargely to the crusading activities of the knights of the Order of St John. TheItalian-run Maltese Inquisition kept a close eye on their contact with islanders.Muslim slaves were in particular demand by the island’s treasure seekers. Islam was76|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"outlawed and so the only ones ostensibly practising were the enslaved or crypto-Muslims who risked persecution from the Inquisition. During the early seven-teenth century the Canon of the Mdina Cathedral dug up part of his basementbelieving former Jewish occupants had buried a treasure under his house. Findingnothing he followed the advice of a Cypriot Greek that he should consult a certainMuslim galley-slave. The slave brought a book with him and began to read from itas he paced the basement. His consultation revealed that to obtain the treasure theritual sacriWce of a black hen was required. After handing over some valuables, theCanon eventually realized he was being defrauded. Unfortunately for the clergy-man the Inquisition got to hear of what had been going on.133For the Catholic Church, Protestantism may have been a diabolic heresy but itwas not seen as inherently magical. Yet the authoritarian control of printing in theMediterranean was closely tied to the Protestant threat, and Spanish disquiet overthe leaky Pyrenees shaped enduring perceptions of the source of illicit magic andgrimoires. In1569an inquisitor in Catalonia remarked, ‘an inquisitor is neededhere in order to frighten the people from France.’134The concerns were justiWedto a certain degree. During the second half of the sixteenth century numerousFrenchmen sought work across the border in Spain, particularly in Catalonia andAragon. Amongst them were numerous print workers, many of whom weretrained in the major publishing centres of Lyon and Geneva, which also happenedto be centres of Calvinism. The authorities’ fears were also exacerbated by reportsof concerted eVorts toXood the country withReformist literature, such as thetestimony of a Catholic merchant in1568that he had seen large numbers ofProtestant books stacked in Lyon awaiting transit to Spain. On the western sideof the Pyrenees the situation also caused considerable concern. In1609the abbotof Urdax in the Basque region complained that on the route from Bayonne insouthwestern France right down to Pamplona there was not one Inquisition agentin position to examine the mule caravans for heretical books.135It should be noted that the French authorities on the other side of the Pyreneeswere hardly inactive themselves. In1547the archdiocese of Toulouse instructedclergy and civil oYcials to visit all booksellers in the city, and between1530and1560theParlementof Toulouse charged some forty people with possessingheretical books. The authorities were particularly suspicious of anyone associatedwith Geneva, and a royal edict of1551instructed that those bearing books fromCalvin’s city were to be prosecuted ‘as heretics and disturbers of public peace andtranquillity’.136Protestantism was not the only heresy the Spanish authorities feared from thenorth. Over the centuries inquisitors dealt with numerous French magicians andtreasure hunters. In1511a priest named Joan Vicente and three conspirators weretried for sorcery by the Saragossa tribunal. Vicente, who was originally fromWar against Magic|77"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Perpignan, a French town at the base of the eastern Pyrenees, was in possession ofa copy of theClavicule of Solomonand other magical manuscripts. They had beentranscribed by a notary named Miguel Sa ́nchez from books Vicente said werefromRome. One of them was a work called theClavicule of Virgil, whichcontained the characters of a hundred demons and the method of conjuringthem. The magicians managed to burn their magic books and manuscripts beforethe Inquisition got their hands on them, and Vicente and Sa ́nchez later escapedfrom prison. The frustrated inquisitors burned them in eYgy instead.137In1668aFrench Franciscan was condemned to three years reclusion by the Saragossatribunal for possessing forbidden books and treasure hunting. At the end of thecentury the Inquisition tortured and questioned a youngmoriscohealer namedJeronimo Espinel from the village of Torrellas, who had been engaged in exor-cizing the possessed. He claimed he ‘had read much in Castilian universities,including the Pentacles of Solomon’. More to the point, he had also acquiredmagical knowledge from two Frenchmen who aided him inWnding buriedtreasure.138Concerns over the spread of witches and magicians from France reached feverpitch in1609when a major witch hunt was launched in the neighbouring BasqueFrench region of the Pays de Labourd. One of the two judges who zealouslypursued the investigation, Pierre de Lancre, described how witches ‘wereXeeingin great numbers both by land and sea . . . and the crowd at the frontier grew largerby the hour. They professed to be travelling pilgrims on the way to Santiago.’Two French agents were sent into Spain to try andWnd and arrest one suspectedfemale ringleader of the witches. The local inquisitors, although fairly scepticalregarding the accusations against theXeeing French witches, were concerned thatthis foreign invasion would still ‘do great harm’ to the realm.139The fear of magical traYc was not all one way. Throughout the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries French demonologists had blamed foreigners, Savoyardsand Italians in particular, with introducing and spreading the plague of witchcraftand sorcery across the kingdom. The French lawyer Jean Bodin (1530–96)identiWed one such source of diabolic infection. ‘In the year1568,’ he declared,‘the Italians and Spaniards going to the Low Countries carried notes full ofsorceries that had been given them as guarantees against all misfortunes.’140Hewas referring to what is known as the SpanishRoad, the hugely important militaryand trade route running down eastern France to northwestern Italy, which wascrucial for fuelling the Spanish military occupation of the Low Countries. Suchsuspicions over foreigners and the viral texts they carried were born out by casessuch as that reported in a pamphlet in1610. It related how theParlementofBordeaux had arrested four itinerant Spaniards, three men and a woman, forbeing magicians and witches. The group had apparently wandered all over Italy,78|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Flanders, and France oVering their services, and stood accused of killing livestockand harming crops. When the authorities searched their bags they found ‘severalbooks, characters, notes, wax, knives, parchments and other items used in magic’.They said they had learned their magical arts in Toledo.141As we have seen,tensions across the southwestern border were high at the time due to the witchhunt carried out by de Lancre. While the Spanish authorities were concernedabout witchesXeeing in their direction, de Lancre warned of the Spanishsaluda-doresor cunning-folk coming the other way to make money from curing witch-craft. This was compounded by the many Moors making their way across thePyrenees after a mass expulsion in1609. De Lancre described onesaludadornamedDom Pedro who was active in the region around the town of Bayonne. ‘I don’tknow if he was one of them, or whether the Great Moor Satan had left him in thiscountry to take advantage of its people,’ he said. Dom Pedro managed to evadethe French authorities and de Lancre pondered whether ‘he returned to Spain totell the othersaludadoresthat it would do them no good to come to France.’142The Inquisitions clearly failed to control theXow of magic manuscripts. In factthey circulated more widely then ever before. A decree of the Congregation ofthe Holy OYce issued in1573ordered the burning of all books of magicconWscated and archived by the tribunals because the numbers of them werebecoming unmanageable.143This fact in itself shows how the Church was losingthe battle. They were, however, pretty eVective in controlling the developmentof the printing industry, in Spain in particular. Yet the restrictions merely led to aXourishing Spanish language publishing industry outside the country and thedevelopment of smuggling operations that funnelled large numbers of forbiddenSpanish books produced by printers in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.144In Italy, which was not a uniWed country and therefore had no centralized secularauthority other than the Papacy, it was one thing for the Church to issue edictsabout inspecting and suppressing booksellers but they were not necessarily carriedout with any real conviction by the various city-states and principalities. InVenice, for instance, the printed works of Agrippa could be purchased to orderfrom booksellers who used their contacts abroad to smuggle in copies. Onesuch Venetian book dealer, Pietro Longo, had previously worked in Basel andStrasburg. In1586he obtained a work by Agrippa for a Bolognese visitor toVenice, and admitted to giving another Agrippa to a nobleman, and a book byPeter d’Abano to a ducal secretary. His son in England was one of his suppliers.Longo paid a terrible price for trading in such books and was drowned on theorders of the Inquisition in1588.145Such harsh punishment evidently did notwork as a deterrent. Several Venetian occult booksellers were investigated in the1640s, including Boniface Cabiana who was reported to deal ‘in C. Agrippa and abook with little signs and secret circles’.146Furthermore, Italy and Italians seem toWar against Magic|79"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"have been an important source of the Agrippan works and grimoires that circu-lated in Portugal in the period.147The legacy of the Inquisitions is evident from the fact that while the boom inpopulist publishing during the eighteenth century led to a massive proliferation ofcheap grimoires, little was produced in Italy or Spain: theXow of books wasdecidedly from north to south. In Protestant countries and in Catholic areas wherethe Inquisition did not operate, the ecclesiastical and secular authorities had amuch harder time in controlling the expansion of illicit magic publishing.Loving itTowards the end of the sixteenth century the Inquisitions’ attentions began toshift away from heresy towards ‘superstition’ and moral crimes. Both of these wereembodied in the activities of prostitutes who not only engaged in illicit sexualbehaviour but also used and traded in magic.148Some oVered to ensure thegambling success of their clients. In1627one man testiWed to the Venetiantribunal that a prostitute had told him how to conjure the soul of Judas to revealthe names of the victors in a forthcoming election.149But it was love magic thatgenerated the most concern. As one inquisitorial manual explained:To make men come to their dwellings they perform many sortileges [actsof sorcery]. They sweep the hearth, they cast salt in theWre, they blessbeans, they tie ribbons into knots while they are at Mass. And whilemaking these knots they pronounce unknown words, but lascivious andmost indecent against this holy sacriWce.150Finding out what these ‘unknown words’ were and where they learned themwas one of the tasks of the inquisitors. An ordinance of the Milan tribunal in1605listed as a particularly female problem the profane use and false attribution ofprayers to Saint Daniel, Saint Martha, Saint Cyprian, Saint Helen, and others.151The prayer to Saint Martha to provoke love was particularly widespread acrossthe Mediterranean during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Legend had itthat, after Christ’s Ascension, Martha, who was the sister of Mary Magdalene andLazarus, travelled across the sea to Tarascon in Provence, where she killed afearsome dragon calledla Tarasqueand introduced Christianity to the people.152The nature of the prayer’s content was revealed during an inquisitor’s visit toNew Granada (Trinidad) in1568, where he investigated the activities of a magicalpractitioner named Marı ́a de Medina. She possessed a written copy, which ran:80|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"My Lady Saint Martha, worthy you are and saintly. By my Lord JesusChrist you were cherished and loved; by my Lady the Virgin Maryyou were hosted and welcomed. To the mount of Talarc ̧on you wentand beheld the live serpent; with your hyssop of water you sprinkledit and with your holy girdle you bound and delivered it unto thepeople. Just as this is true, bring so-and-so unto me, who was theperson she desired to come to her, calm, placid, and bound of handand foot and heart so that he should love me and call me his lady andtake pleasure in no one, if not me.153Literacy rates for women remained stubbornly low in Spain and Italy. A studyof the early modern Inquisition records of Toledo indicates that some87per centof women were illiterate over the period, and a similarWgure has been estimatedfor women in sixteenth-century Italy.154But women, even illiterate women,were evidently taking advantage of literary magic and print culture, servicing botha female and a literate male clientele in the love magic market. This is mostevident from the lively trade incartas di voler bene, as they were known in Italy.These were pieces of paper or parchment on which prayers, spells and magicalsymbols were written and their power was activated by it touching the persondesired.155A study of prostitutes investigated by the Inquisition in Modena reveals thatalthough magical orations and charms were learned orally and, as one said, were kept‘always in her heart’, those who could read were thought to be the most skilled in theart of love magic. Written copies accrued more potency than those held in oralmemory, while those recorded in books were more eYcacious than charms writtenon loose sheets. In1600a noted female love magician was described as reading from abig book with ‘a black cover, which is full of incantations and secrets’. One prostitutesaid the prayer she had written on a piece of paper was less eVective than anotherpossessed by a courtesan who obtained hers from ‘a book in which there are lots ofthese things’.156At the top of this hierarchy of texts was print, and the Modenatribunal heard several cases of prostitute love magicians requesting printers toproduce versions of the prayers they knew. This may have been in part to rendertheir power more potent, but the sale of such mass-produced prayers also proved anexcellent money-spinner.There were many female love magicians who were not prostitutes of course,and one of the most well known in mid-seventeenth century Venice was LauraMalipiero, who ostensibly obtained an income running a boarding house. WhenInquisition agents searched her premises they found written spells and herbalbooks, but it was the several copies of theClavicule of Solomonin various stagesof completion, which included sections on ‘sacriWces for spirits and how toWar against Magic|81"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"sacriWce’, that most interested them. Although Laura said she could not read andthat they belonged to one of her lodgers, it is likely that this entrepreneurialwoman was involved in the city’s thriving black market in grimoires. Anotherwell-known Venetian cunning-woman, Lucia Barozzi, possessed a parchmentprotective charm containing pentacles, circles, and the names of spirits, and hadmany copies made to sell on to clients.157So the high rates of illiteracy were not a barrier to theexploitationof literary magic,but the vast majority of grimoires still continued to rest in the hands of men ratherthan women. The illiterate could make play of possessing grimoires, deal in them,and have charms copied from them for resale, but they could not, without aid,actually employ much of the magic they contained. The male dominance of treasurehunting, for instance, has more to do with the lack of most women’s ability toreadgrimoires than any engrained gendered division of magical practice in society.The Devil’s bookWhen questioned by the Inquisition, Father Cesare Lanza, the treasure hunter wemet earlier, spoke freely about what he saw as the diminished power of ancient,high magic, and made the telling comment, ‘Today a lowly little woman doesmore than all the necromancers accomplished in the ancient world. Moreoverthere is not a person who is not wearing some kind of charm with characters.’158Maybe he was thinking in terms of the role women evidently played in simple folkmagic, but Lanza was speaking at a time when the witch persecution was in fullswing, and demonologists found in the witch trials ample evidence that womenwere more prone to the temptations of the Devil—the inspiration for all magic.Across Europe many accused witches confessed, often but not always undertorture, that they had made a pact with the Devil. This was what the authoritieswanted to hear as it conWrmed their theological fears of a global satanic conspiracy.Judging from the evidence of the confessions, which were usually shaped by theleading questions of judges and magistrates, there were several ways in which thepact was sealed. Being seduced into sex with the Devil was common for femalewitches, and the act of the Devil making a secret, indelible mark on the body of hisservants was also widely assumed regarding witches of both genders. In parts ofEngland the adoption of suckling spirit familiars became another vehicle ofperpetuating satanic relations.159The concept of the written pact between witchesand the Devil has received less attention from historians, and yet throws upinteresting questions about contemporary views of women, literacy, and books.The trial evidence shows clearly that the learned and popular conception of thewitches’ written pact was distinct from that of the classic Faustian pact. The latter,82|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"an almost exclusively literate male crime, was an act of ritual magic involving thedrawing up of a contract by the pact maker that was then presented to the Devil.The usual scenario regarding primarily female witches was a reversal of thisprocess, in that it was the Devil who presented a book or parchment to potentialwitches and tempted them to sign it. In other words the witch was not theinstigator in this pact and there was no bargaining involved. As with sex, theDevil seduced women into signing it.The signing of the Devil’s book or parchment is a comparatively uncommonmeans of pact-making in the trial records of Continental Europe. The mostinXuential example, and one repeated by several seventeenth-century demonol-ogists, concerned the charge against fourteen women executed for witchcraft inthe papal territory of Avignon in1582: ‘that [so] the Father of Lies should have acare to delete and obliterate you from the book of life you did at his directionand command with your own hands write your names in the black book thereprepared, the roll of the wicked condemned to eternal death’.160As thissuggests, then, the Devil’s book is basically an inversion of the biblical notionof the Book of Life mentioned in the Old Testament and most prominently inRevelations in the New Testament.161So while the Book of Life is a record ofall the righteous elected to salvation by God, or contains the names of those forwhom Christ died, the Devil’s book is a ledger of damnation. One’s namecannot be in both.Most women at the time were illiterate, so the act of signing the book wouldhave limited this diabolic strategy. The English clergymanRichard Bernard (1568–1641), who was heavily inXuenced by Continental demonological writings, ob-served that the Devil’s pact was ‘uttered either by word of mouth, of such as cannotwrite; or in writing by others’.162There were ways around the literacy problem.The Devil could oVer a helping hand of course. In1645a Norfolk womanconfessed that the Devil in the guise of a tall black man conversed with her onemoonlit night and cut her hand with a penknife; she wrote her name in his bookwith the blood, her hand being guided by him.163Just as with legal documents atthe time, the illiterate could also sign themselves with a cross. One of the womenaccused at Salem said the Devil in the guise of a black man ‘brought a book & shetouched it with a stick that was dipt in an ink horne & it made a red mark’.164InEnglish cases it is mostly the Devil who actually puts the names of the witches in hisbook, the physical link required to seal the pact being enacted by writing with thewitches’ blood. Anne Leach confessed that the Devil drew blood from under hertongue with which he wrote her name on a piece of paper, while Margaret Wyardsaid he fetched blood from her thigh and wrote on a paper with it. Intriguingly weWnd a similar preponderance of such accounts in the witch trials of eighteenth-century Hungary. One woman prosecuted in1746described how the DevilWar against Magic|83"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"dressed in a blue caftan ‘hit her in the nose, with the blood issuing from there heentered her name in a book’, and another accused witch said the Devil entered hername in his book ‘with a pen dipped in blood from her littleWnger’.165Parts of eastern Hungary were Calvinist and it is possible that if such cases weremapped on to the region’s confessional map, they might conWrm a direct con-nection between the Devil’s book and Calvinism. It is certainly the case that mostexamples of written witch pacts in England were recorded during the Puritanascendancy of the Civil War period, and in particular during the East Anglianwitch hunt orchestrated by the puritan witch-Wnder Matthew Hopkins between1645and1647. It is likely the written pact became more prominent at this timedue to the Puritan parliamentary emphasis on signing or marking oaths andcovenants, such as the Protestation Oath of1641, the Vow and Covenant of1643, and the Solemn League and Covenant of1644. Those who took these oathsor covenants were required to swear them aloud and then sign their names or puttheir marks in columns on a parchment, roll, or book containing the oath orcovenant. For this reason they are important documents for assessing literacy ratesat the time.166While these covenants were inspired by national political agendasthey represented personal commitments, symbolizing individual battles withconscience, and the tormentor Satan. Those who broke them were repeatedlywarned of God’s judgement. It is understandable, then, that in Puritan-inXuencedpopular cultures at this time entering into ‘a solemn league’ with the Devil wouldbe conceived as much in terms of a written as a sexual pact.167Although the Devil’s book was not a grimoire the two were easily conXated inthe minds of the suspicious, particularly with regard to women. If, as somedemonologists believed, the mere possession of grimoires constituted an implicitpact, the Eve-inspired curiosity of women would more likely lead them to explicitrelations with the Devil. This notion is evident from the1653trial of the Wiltshirecunning-woman Anne Bodenham. To impress her clients she made a lot of thefact that she possessed books of magic. These were used to help her clients, butonce she was accused of witchcraft the possession of occult works becameassociated with the Devil’s book. Languishing in gaol she wearily confessed thatshe had a red book which ‘was written half over with blood (being the names ofwitches that had listed themselves under the Devil’s command)’.168Colonial fearsOne might have thought that controlling the circulation of forbidden bookswould have proved a much easier task in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies.Yet right from the beginning the censors faced serious diYculties in suppressing84|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"the inXux of prohibited literature, which arrived not only via Spanish andPortuguese ships but also traders from France and the Low Countries, the mainsources of illicit Spanish publications. An inventory of books to be shipped by adealer in Seville to Mexico in1600included works by Della Porta, AlbertusMagnus, Alexis Piemontese, and Paracelsus. While none of the titles wereexplicitly magical in nature, these were names that would have immediatelyaroused the suspicion of any ecclesiastical censor.169Furthermore, colonial eccle-siastical libraries that housed forbidden books were frequently robbed.170Thosewith good social standing did not need to go to such lengths as they could apply toconsult the libraries on pious or legitimate scientiWc grounds. The doctor Crist\u0002obalMe ́ndez, tried for sorcery by the Mexican Inquisition in1538, testiWed that he hadlearned the art of making silver and gold astrological medallions for health andfortune from books he had read in the cathedral library in Mexico City.171A permanent Inquisition was never established in the Portuguese colony ofBrazil, so a Visitor General was sent there to try cases three or four times onlengthy visits between1591and1650. TheWrst couple of visits were motivatedprimarily by concerns over the activities ofconversosand, to a lesser extent, theinXuence of Protestantism and Islam. But dozens of cases of magic and ‘supersti-tion’ were also heard. A detailed study of trials in the Brazilian province ofPernambuco between1590and1810reveals that of692crimes heard by theInquisition57concerned witchcraft and magic, but only3concerned the posses-sion of prohibited books. Most concerned Portuguese colonists rather thanindigenous peoples or African slaves. Cases of female love magic were prominent,along with witchcraft and magical healing. Seven people came forward to de-nounce one Maria Gonc ̧alves, for instance, who they accused of carrying thebones of hanged criminals to protect herself from the authorities, and withspeaking with demons.172On the other side of the continent, in Peru, the Spanish set up a tribunal inLima, which tried some three thousand people or so during its existence. Twelveper cent of them concerned magic and ‘superstition’, mostly involving the loweststrata of society, including slaves and poor women, particularly midwives andprostitutes, amongst whom written and oral prayers to Saint Martha were popu-lar.173Several monks were investigated for making diabolic pacts. In the1580sprinted and manuscript books of chiromancy were found on a priest namedFernando de Cuevas, chaplain of the city’s Carmelite convent. Its most famousdefendant was the famed Spanish sailor and explorer Pedro Sarmiento (1532–92),the author ofThe History of the Incas, and one-time captive of WalterRaleigh’sXeet. He found himself hauled before the Lima tribunal on several occasions. Onetime he was accused of having books of magic and prayers that allowed him toinvoke the Devil, and on another occasion of possessing magic rings and magic inkWar against Magic|85"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"which made love letters irresistible to their female readers.174A Neapolitan namedJer\u0002onimo de Caracciolo was also accused of possessing books of magic. But theonly concrete evidence of the use of a grimoire in Peru concerns an embroiderer,Diego de laRosa, who was accused of necromancy in1580.175He possessed amanuscript in his own handwriting ‘with many characters, Greek and Hebrewletters and other evil things’, which he had lent to others to make copies. Itscontents contained a familiar blend of spells and conjurations to attract women,Xythrough the air, become invisible, andWnd hidden treasure. The pig-tailed de laRosa’s other crime was spending too much time with native Indian witch doctorswho instructed him in the use of magical herbs.In terms of theXow and quantity of forbidden books in circulation in theSpanish Americas it was the Mexican censors who had the most work to do instemming the tide. A fascinating insight into the challenge they faced is providedby the story of the library of Melchor Pe ́rez de Soto, a Mexico City architectarrested by the Inquisition in1665, charged with practising astrology and sorcery,and owning prohibited books on the subject. The Inquisition conWscated1,592volumes, which meant that Pe ́rez de Soto must have had one of the mostextensive private libraries in the colony, particularly for someone of a relativelymodest social position. AWfth of his books consisted of fables, novels, poetry,treatise on language, and the like, mostly in Spanish but also some in Latin, Italian,Portuguese, and French. Books on mathematics, astronomy, military science,architecture, medicine, religion, and history formed a major part of the rest ofthe collection. As to the charges against him, he certainly possessed numerouslearned discourses on astrology, two works on physiognomy, and an earlysixteenth-century treatise on alchemy.While still under investigation Pe ́rez de Soto was killed by his prison cellmate.The Inquisitorial censors sifted meticulously through his books, identifying thosethat could be returned to his widow, those that needed to be expurgated, andthose that were to be conWscated and destroyed. Most of the expurgated volumeswere works of astronomy. The censors identiWed ten works that required furtherinvestigation. One of them was della Porta’s book on cryptography,De occultisliterarum notis. They probably suspected that it contained information similar tothat in hisNatural Magic. Of the books clearly forbidden there were several onjudicial astrology, but none were titles that contained conjurations. Some werewithheld because they committed the oVence of not stating the date, publisher,and place of publication, while others were published in such heretical places asAmsterdam. An Italian edition of Piemontese’sSecretscaused some consternationto the censors as only the Spanish edition was listed in the SpanishIndex, while abook falsely attributed to Peter d’Abano led to some head scratching.17686|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Less innocent was the library and activities of PedroRuiz Calder\u0002on, whoarrived in Mexico over a century before Pe ́rez de Soto’s tragic experience withthe Inquisition.Ruiz Calder\u0002on, a priest, was a boastful chap and a charlatan whosometimes passed himself oVas a papal legate or inquisitor. On his arrival inMexico in the late1530s he had been quick to broadcast his vaunted skills in theart of magic.Rumour had it that he could make himself invisible, that he couldmagically transport himself to Spain and back at will, and that he had power overwomen.Regarding the latter, his powers of invisibility came in handy whileXeeing cuckolds. He said he accrued much of his knowledge during a sojournin the Levant where he had trained amongst wizards and received lessons inChaldean, Hebrew, and Greek. Then there was a further trip to Germany totake an apprenticeship in alchemy, and on to Paris to learn how to cast outdemons.Ruiz Calder\u0002on had brought his library of occult works with him, oneof which he claimed contained the signature of the prince of Devils which he hadobtained in Italy during a brief descent into Hell. In the somewhat claustrophobicworld of colonial Mexico it was perhaps inevitable that such boasting would soonattract the attention of the Inquisition. In1540Ruiz Calder\u0002on was arrested and hisbooks conWscated. As in Pe ́rez de Soto’s case, the censors closely scrutinized them.As beWtted a priest, there were pious works and breviaries, Dominican sermonsand philosophical works. They also found a copy of Albertus Magnus’sSecrets,anexorcism manual, and a book by the thirteenth-century scientist and alchemistArnold de Villanova, probably theTreasure of Treasures. Apparently no identiWablegrimoires were found, and certainly not the one containing the Devil’s signa-ture—much to the inquisitors’ disappointment.Ruiz Calder\u0002on got oVfairlylightly, being sentenced to banishment in Spain and prohibited from sayingMass for two years. Immediately after the sentencing, however, he had to betaken to hospital. As the concluding paragraphs of his trial records note, thisirrepressible and foolish boaster continued to regale his fellow inmates with storiesof his magical accomplishments and told of other books of magic in his possessionthat had not been conWscated.177Despite suspicions and accusations most of the occult books in the earlycolonies seem to have been divinatory rather than magical, with almanacs andlearned astrological treatises circulating quite widely across Spanish America.178This may help explain the surprisingly few cases of magical treasure hunting heardby the overseas Inquisitions.Ruiz Calder\u0002on certainly boasted of his ability todiscover pre-conquest treasures and claimed several conquistadors had hired hisservices for this purpose. In1622the Lima tribunal heard the case of two menaccused of using sorcery to uncover treasure hidden in Inca burial grounds.179Butotherwise Diego de laRosa is a rare case. He confessed to using his grimoireduring an expedition to uncover a treasure that a native Indian had informed himWar against Magic|87"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"was buried in a mountain together with the entrails of an Inca chieftain. De laRosa dressed in a ceremonial white tunic with a green stole, and used incense, waxcandles, and four pomegranate wands during the conjuration, but to no avail.180Arecent major study of witchcraft and magic in colonial Brazil also notes magicaltreasure hunting as an uncommon activity. The author recounts the case ofan eighteenth-century slave and magical healer fromRio de Janeiro namedDomingos A ́lvares who the Inquisition exiled to the Algarve in1744. Onlyonce settled in Portugal did Domingo begin to specialize in detecting legendaryburied treasures attributed to the Moors, and conducting spirit conjurations whilewearing a white sheet.181In the English colonies of North America a commercial book trade also beganwith the arrival of theWrst settlers. Bibles and pious works obviously predomin-ated, but university-educated men also brought over larger collections of scientiWcand philosophical works, and hidden amongst them occult texts slipped their wayinto the new territory. Indeed, theWrst governor of Connecticut, John WinthropJr (1606–76), a practising alchemist, possessed a wide range of esoteric works.Emigrating from England in1631he brought over with him some1,000volumes,and continued to build up his collection in his new home, most notably obtainingsome books owned by John Dee.182There were also books on Paracelsianmedicine,Rosicrucianism, and astrology amongst the many tomes on theologyand personal piety in the library of the wealthy Virginian clergyman ThomasTeackle (d.1696). He owned the alchemist Thomas Vaughan’s,Magia Adamica(London,1650), John Heydon’sTheRosie Crucian infallible axiomata(London,1660), and ‘Magica natur’, which was probably a copy of Porta’sNatural Magic.183Just as in the Spanish and French colonies, the authorities in New England triedto control the book trade to prevent the Puritan population from being contam-inated by the ungodly literature that they saw as plaguing England. To this end theMassachusetts General Court empowered four ministers to ‘allowe or prohibitprinting’.184It was easy atWrst to control the nascent American print industry, butonce again censoring theXow of books from abroad proved an impossible taskwithout instigating a ruthless stop-and-search policy. Profane chapbooks contain-ing light-hearted romances, ballads, and the like were no doubt carried in thepacks of emigrants and traded by sailors, as were astrological almanacs anddivination manuals. Mention of such texts cropped up occasionally in the witchtrials of New England. Literary occult knowledge could also be transported in themind as well as on the page. During her trial in1669, for example, KatherineHarrison of WethersWeld, Connecticut, a wealthy woman who had arrived inAmerica around1651, said she had learned fortune-telling from reading‘Mr Lilly’s book’ while living in England.18588|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Astrological and other divinatory guides were not grimoires, but in the purit-anical environment of early colonial America the possession or knowledge of anybook with occult content could generate suspicions of something more satanicallysinister. The blurring of devilish magic and astrology in the minds of the religiousauthorities was made worse by the likes of the New Haven reprobate JohnBrowne, who was tried in1664for ‘pretending as if he had some art to raysethe divell’. From the detailed account of his trial it would appear he did not, butnevertheless had fun scaring an acquaintance, Eliakim Hitchcock, by pretendingto do so by drawing up a horoscope. Hitchcock told Brown he did not think thatcould be done, but Brown swore it was possible but threw his astrologicalWgures intheWre saying that the Devil would have come otherwise and torn the house topieces.186The danger of such conXation is all too apparent from reading theevidence against Dorcas Hoar, who was caught up in the Salem witch trials of1692.TheRevd John Hale testiWed that twenty years or so earlier, stories hadcirculated that Dorcas was a fortune-teller and possessed a book on palmistry.Hale confronted her about it, telling her ‘it was an evill book & evill art.’ Much tohis satisfaction she renounced such practices, but some years later the wicked bookapparently made its appearance again. Hale’s daughter,Rebecca, said that sheknew Hoar had been involved in thefts from the house but had not told him of itbecause Hoar ‘was a witch & had a book’ by which she could divine whether shetold her father.Rebecca said that she had seen Hoar’s book, ‘& there were manystreaks & pictures in it by w’ch (as she was told) the said Hoar could revealesecretes & work witchcrafts.’ Thomas Tuck conWrmed that he had also seen thebook ‘w’th streaks & pictures’. So a simple work on palmistry, through fear,rumour, and ignorance, had become a grimoire. TheReverend now launched ahunt for this evil presence. He strongly believed that witches made their pacts bysigning a Devil’s book. Some in his community who were plagued by diabolicspectres said the book was ‘represented to them (as to them it seemed) withthreatnings of great torments, if they signed not’.187Hoar’s husband admitted thathis wife had borrowed the book from a lodger named John Samsons but hadreturned it some twenty years earlier. Hoar questioned Samsons, who said he hadowned a book on palmistry when he lived with the Hoars but had sold it at Casco-Bay many years earlier.188No doubt Hale experienced a sense of frustration ofsuch proof being beyond his grasp.So did grimoires circulate in early colonial popular culture? Were they beingused as they were back in England? In Essex County a servant girl was accused ofthreatening another that ‘shee had a book in which she could read and call thedivill’, and in1652a man was accused of saying he had made contact with the Devilafter ‘he read in a book of magic’.189These are likely to have been idle threats orslanderous comments rather than proof that manuscripts of spirit conjuration wereWar against Magic|89"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"being read. Despite the strong puritanical inXuence over early settlers it wouldseem that it only took a little more than a generation or so for cunning-folk andfortune-tellers to becomeWrmly established in America.190Yet, at least until thelast years of the seventeenth century, there is little evidence that they possessedanything more than divinatory works. It was the fear that diabolic grimoires werecirculating, rather than the reality, that nurtured the prominence given to theconcept of the Devil’s book during the devastating Salem trials of1692.AroundWfty of those accused of witchcraft during the Salem episode confessedto signing the Devil’s book to seal their pact, forty of them women.191It has beensuggested that this preoccupation related to authoritarian concerns over the recentgrowth of America’s printing presses and the production of explicitly astrologicalalmanacs from the1680s onwards.192We canWnd an analogy for this in theeighteenth-century Hungarian witch trial material. One woman who confessed topacting with the Devil described how the Devil wrote her name in a book ‘thatlooked like an almanac’.193At the same time, the popular conception of signing aDevil’s book might also have been inXuenced by the New England Indian landspeculation bubble of the1680s, during which many people had the experience ofsigning land purchases with the Native Americans, who some saw as diabolicagents. One Salem woman told how the Devil in the guise of a ‘Tawny man’ orIndian, had presented her with a piece of birch bark, ‘and she made a mark withherWnger by rubbing oVthe white ScurV’.194Further analogies have also beenmade with the popular experience of frontier traders’ account books in whichcustomers’ credit and debt were recorded. This echoes the register-like nature ofthe Devil’s book and the spiritual debtors who signed it.195Indeed, it wasrecorded of one of the Salem suspects that the Devil temped her with a ‘Book,somewhat long and thick (Like the wast-books of many Traders’, butt bound andclasp’t, andWlled not only with the Names or Marks, but also with the explicit(short) Covenants of such as had listed themselves in the Service of Satan’.196Because of their religion and their social status, seventeenth-century NewEngland colonialists had a signiWcantly higher literacy rate than those in thecountry they left—around60per cent male literacy compared to less than40per cent in England.197For the same reasons they had a more intimate andcomplex relationship with literary culture. The Devil’s book was a sign of thetimes. In the early1690s the puritan preoccupation with the ever-present Devilmixed toxically with authoritarian fears over the inXuence of profane popularliterature, particularly on women. It seems likely that this was coupled withpopular anxieties raised by the experience of signing—not oaths of allegiance asin Civil War England, but speculative legal andWnancial documents. Even at thisearly stage the commercial was evidently a match for the spiritual impulse inAmerican society.90|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"A rude shockFears over the aristocratic use of magic to plot against monarchies had been a factorin the rise of witchcraft, but at the dawn of the so-called Enlightenment sensationalevidence of the widespread use of magic and grimoires in the court of Louis XIVsealed its decriminalization in France. Towards the end of the seventeenth centurythe worst of the excesses of the witch hunts were over in Western Europe thanks toincreasing judicial circumspection about the evidence required to prove the crime.The trials ended earlier in France than most of the Continent. The last person to besentenced to death for witchcraft by theparlementof Paris, one of nine regional legaljurisdictions in the country which oversaw justice in most of northern France,occurred as early as1625, and only a trickle of cases were heard after that. Trials andexecutions took place in greater numbers and later elsewhere in the country, and inthe early1670s the central government in Paris was required to intervene in theaVairs of otherparlementsto ensure that rigorous judicial procedures were applied incases of witchcraft.198It was all the more shocking, then, when the royal court wasexposed as being the country’s hotbed of diabolic activity.In1678the lieutenant general of the Paris police, Nicolas de laReynie, beganto uncover circumstantial evidence of a plot to poison Louis XIV. For a couple ofyearsReynie had been investigating the activities of poisoners following thescandalous case of the Marquise de Brinvilliers, who was beheaded for poisoningher brothers to get her hands on the family fortune. The more the Paris policedelved into the murky world of the supply and administration of poisons in thecapital the more it became clear that the trade was part of a wider, thrivingnetwork of professional magical practice. Furthermore, it was not only humbleParisians who resorted to the homes of fortune-tellers and cunning-folk. Severalpractitioners accrued considerable prosperity and inXuence thanks to the aristo-cratic demand for their illicit services. Amongst those caught up in the aVair wasthe famed general the Duc de Luxembourg, and one of Louis XIV’s mistresses,Madame de Montespan, who was at the centre of the web of suspicions. Malecourtiers were particularly enticed by the magicians’ promises of great wealthaccrued through alchemy, gambling, and treasure hunting. While female aristo-crats also shared these interests, they also supported a thriving trade in lovepowders and potions to ensure the faithfulness of their husbands or lovers. Themodern-day obsession with plastic surgery also had its venerable parallels, withmagical cosmetics and medicine being purchased to improve complexions and toenlarge breasts. As well as feeding aristocratic greed and vanity, the magicians alsoprovided such sinister services as the disposal of unwanted babies, giving rise to thetitle ‘angel makers’, and providing poisons or ‘inheritance powders’ to do awaywith detested husbands, family members, and rivals.199War against Magic|91"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"This sordid world of magic wasWrst revealed toReynie in all its grotesquenessby the confessions of two sorceresses. One was a tailor’s wife named MarieVigoureux and the other the widowed wife of a horse dealer, Marie Bosse. Asthey began to talk under interrogation and out of revenge, a close-knit under-world of magicians, fortune-tellers, shepherd herbalists, chemists, and magiciansemerged, and as the police round-up escalated so the grimoires conWscated fromtheir houses began to pile up in police headquarters. A grimoire called theEnchiridiumwas most frequently mentioned in the police records, and its identityis conWrmed by one interrogation where the ‘Enchiridium Leonis papæ’ was men-tioned.200Over forty priests were arrested and it would seem that magic bookscirculated widely among them. Numerous grimoires and magical manuscriptswere found in the home of the elderly debauched priest E ́tienne Guibourg, whoconfessed to performing black masses using the stomach of a naked woman as analtar, and was also accused of sacriWcing babies. One of the books in his library wasentitledConjuration du mirroires magiqueand there were also numerous papersdetailing rituals for summoning the demon Salam.201Grimoires were by nomeans restricted to the clergy and their male accomplices. While Bosse couldonly write her name and nothing more, several grimoires were found amongst thepapers of her more educated arch rival La Voisin, amongst themThe Book of theConjurations of Pope Honorius, which contained a series of spells for gambling.202Afemale magician named Catherine Trianon, who lived together ‘as man and wife’with another cunning-woman, was described as having more learning ‘in the tipof herWnger’ than others acquired in a lifetime. When her house was searched in1680twenty-Wve manuscript volumes on the occult sciences were found.203The AVair of the Poisons was a rude shock to the French body politic. In1682Louis XIV ordered the promulgation of a new law to suppress all those ‘whofollow the vain professions of fortune-tellers, magicians, or sorcerers or othersimilar names’. Strict regulations regarding the sale of poisons were instituted. Thelanguage of the Edict of1682also made it clear that magic was a pernicious beliefrather than a real diabolic force. By banishing magicians and their ilk the Edictaimed to protect ‘many ignorant and credulous people who were unwittinglyengaged with them’. The crime of witchcraft was not explicitly mentioned, butthe new law eVectively ended the likelihood of further trials under its olddeWnition. Over the next few decades legislation would gradually appear else-where in Europe reXecting this fundamental shift from magicians as diaboliccriminals to magicians as frauds. Grimoires were no longer instruments of heresybut immoral manuals of superstition. In a sense this revised intellectual attitudetowards magic was a return to that of the early medieval period, before the rise ofthe witch trials. Then again the Enlightenment was about to cast new light upongrimoires and those who used them.92|War against Magic"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTERTHREEENLIGHTENMENT ANDTREASUREThe European Enlightenment is often portrayed as heralding the victory ofreason and rationalism over magic and superstition. The spirit world ofNeoplatonism was vanquished and the clockwork Universe ticked for the edu-cated. The age of miracles was over and the Devil chained to hell. The crimes ofwitchcraft and conjuration were redeWned as a delusion and a fraud. It was the ageof the Lunar Society in Britain, of Linnaeus in Sweden, of Kant in Germany, andRousseau in France. Literacy was increasing across much of western and northernEurope, and the guiding light of rationalism penetrated further and further into theminds of the masses through the increased provision of schooling and that deWningEnlightenment publishing institution—the newspaper. But all is not what it seems.The witch trials were by no means over. They continued in some Germanstates and Switzerland well into the second half of the eighteenth century. InScandinavia people continued to be executed and imprisoned for writing pactswith the Devil. The Inquisitions of southern Europe investigated hundreds ofcases of suspected magic. Across Europe magical treasure seekers were prosecuted.For many, educated and illiterate, the Devil and his minions were a continualthreat to body and soul. In late-eighteenth-century Germany a Catholic priestnamed Johann Joseph Gassner (1727–79) attracted considerable fame and criticismfor exorcizing thousands of people whose illnesses he believed were demonic.The controversy he provoked has been described as ‘one of the largest and noisiestarguments of the whole German Enlightenment’.1The eighteenth century was also the age of roving occult adventurers, notori-ous across Europe in their own lifetimes, men who earnestly explored magic and"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"at the same time exploited the credulity of others in such matters—men likethe Sicilian Giuseppe Balsamo, better known as Count Cagliostro (1743–95).2Balsamo had educated himself in Western and Arabic magic and astrology whilstserving as an apprentice to a monk and experimental chemist named FatherAlbert. Expelled from his monastic apprenticeship, and back on the streets ofPalermo, Balsamo made use of his occult knowledge, selling magical amulets andexorcizing evil spirits. HeXed the city after having duped a wealthy silversmithnamed Vincenzo Marano into believing he could conjure up a treasure buried bythe Moors. Many more occult adventures followed on his tours across Europe,including the sensational boast that he had dined with the spirit of Voltaire.3Of even more enduring fame was the Venetian Giacomo Casanova (1725–98),in many ways a true representative of the Enlightenment. Alongside his manyaccomplishments as a lover, artist, writer, translator, and gambler, there wasmagic. Like Cagliostro, he had amused himself by playing the magician, onceattempting to obtain a treasure buried in the cellar of a house in Cesena, Italy. Heconcocted an account of how Pope Gregory VII had intended to conjure it up butdied before doing so, informing his client that ‘During a night with a full moon, alearned magician can raise the treasure to the surface of the earth by placinghimself in the middle of the magical circle called maximus.’4His route toinXuence in France owed much to his professed skills as an alchemist andmagician. Amongst the magic books he innocently lent to a spying emissary ofthe Inquisition were thePicatrix,Key of Solomon, andZekerboni. It was partly onthe basis of his impressive knowledge of magic that the Austrian noblemanCount Waldstein, a major patron of art and science in central Europe, employedCasanova as his librarian during the adventurer’s last years.Both Cagliostro and Casanova were involved in what some might consideranother counter-Enlightenment development in eighteenth-century educatedsociety: the rise of Freemasonry. The origins of modern Freemasonry are afascinating and complex mix of the mundane and the occult. There is no doubt,though, that ritual magic and alchemy were strong inXuences on many of thosewho joined the various Masonic lodges formed across Europe and America duringthe eighteenth century. The private library of the EnglishRosicrucian andFreemason General CharlesR.Rainsford (1728–1809) demonstrates the wide-ranging occult interests of some members. During his travels and dealings heaccumulated manuscript grimoires in German, Latin, Italian, and French, includ-ing Solomonic works and thePicatrix.5The booming publishing industry in western Europe, which produced news-papers and pumped out books aimed at the education and moral improvement of themasses, also fed the thirst for literary magic amongst a rapidly expanding readership.Obscurantism, the authoritarian impulse to restrict access to knowledge, was alive94|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"and well but increasingly diYcult to maintain. While the Mediterranean Inquisitionscontinued to exert considerable control, elsewhere the secular and religious censorsfought a losing battle. Nowhere was this more evident than in France and its genre ofchapbooks known as thebibliothe`que bleue.6During theWrst half of the eighteenthcentury around one million copies of these cheap publications were being produceda year. They encompassed a huge range of sanctioned and illicit subjects. Amongstthe romances, practical guides to gardening and cooking, lives of the saints, and piousreXections, weWnd the darkest secrets of magic laid bare.Vive le grimoire!After the AVair of the Poisons and the round-up, execution, and imprisonment ofsome of Paris’s most notable magicians, the authorities turned a deliberate blindeye to the magical underworld, leaving the1682Edict underemployed. It was nodoubt considered unwise to open up another can of worms that might implicatethe French court. Out of a total of188diVerent books seized by the Paris policebetween1678and1701only three concerned magic.7Under the auspices ofMarc-Ren\u0002e de Voyer d’Argenson, who succeededReynie as lieutenant general ofthe Paris police force in1697, the number of conWscations would increase sign-iWcantly. The new chief of police reignited the campaign against thefaux sorciers,inspired by concerns over their inXuence on the streets rather than in the boudoirsof the rich. In1702d’Argenson wrote a report on the problem addressed to theKing in which he explained how the fortune-tellers and magicians who plaguedthe capital were a serious threat to public order.8As a consequence, the police casttheir net far wider than they did during the AVair of the Poisons. Between1700and1760at least300such people were either prosecuted or reported to the Parispolice.9Amongst them was the usual range of male and female treasure hunters,diviners, dealers in magical talismans, and diabolists. Grimoires circulated widelyamongst them and the police found copies in the hands of priests, prostitutes,abortionists, chemists, labourers, and tradesmen—a more diverse social range thanthat apparent fromReynie’s investigations. Many of their owners had settled in thecapital from all over France, and there was a fair sprinkling of foreigners, particu-larly Italians but also Germans and Swiss.10Some were more far-Xung migrantssuch as one who changed his name regularly but was commonly known as the‘Turc’, and dressed like an Armenian. He claimed to be a master of the spiritworld, sold love powders, and wielded a magical staVcovered with what werethought to be Hebraic characters.11In1711a woman named Dequin was put in the Bastille for ‘ruining severalbourgeois under the pretext of discovering for them a pretended treasure that sheEnlightenment and Treasure|95"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"said was guarded by spirits’. The arresting oYcer found a parchment on her full ofmagical characters, which she said was her sole source of subsistence.12Several‘evil books’ containing magical characters and spells were conWscated from atwenty-year-old adventurer named Tirmont who was accused of treasure huntingand corrupting young girls.13In1702the man with the biggest reputationamongst thefaux sorciersin the city was a carpenter named Louvet, a man ‘deepin the science of the grimoire’, who lived in theRue du Four. The police reportedthat he was rarely to be found with saws and hammers, instead making a healthyliving by treasure hunting and arranging pacts with the Devil. His clique consistedof a coachman, a fruiterer, a baker, and his wife.14There were those who made aliving providing such characters with grimoires. One mentioned in d’Argenson’sreport was a man named Jemme, who the police believed was a relative of themarquis d’Ambreville. This rogue had left his wife and children and taken up witha prostitute. He also sold consecrated Solomonic pentacles and triangles drawn onvirgin parchment. Another was Le Beau, a master tailor, who sold grimoiressigned by spirits.15From the records theClavicule of Solomonemerges as the most inXuentialgrimoire amongst the Parisian mages. Whether it had grown in popularity sincethe AVair of the Poisons, or the police were just more detailed in their examin-ation of the magic books they conWscated is diYcult to say. TheGrimoire du PapeHonoriuswas the next most popular magic book. In1701weWnd a diabolist doctornamed Aubert de Saint-E ́tienne boasting that he possessed copies of both gri-moires. These he used on numerous occasions to call up the Devil. During onesatanic session with a fellow pact addict, he apparently chopped oVthe head of acat and buried the body in a cellar. They put the head in a pot with seven broadbeans, one placed in each opening in the head, accompanied by the utterance ofvarious conjurations and the sprinkling of holy water.16This ritual for invisibilitycould be found in versions of theClavicule. TheEnchiridion Leonis Papæ, Latinprint versions of which had been available for a while, was also popular. In1745apolice search of the papers of a well-known disreputable clergyman, the abb\u0002eLeValet deRocheblanche, uncovered ‘L’Enchiridion du pape L\u0002eon, a treatise ofmagic in Latin, and diVerent magical characters traced on diVerent pieces ofpaper’.17The police also conWscated a grimoire entitled ‘les vertus admirables desPsaumes de David’, which its owner, a magical healer namedRadeville living in lefaubourg de St Denis, was intending to consecrate to the spirit Marcas. In hisreport d’Argenson described one of the ‘psalms’ dedicated to the spirit PrinceJesnu, the purpose of which was to protect againstWre and bleeding.18An obscuretext that also cropped up several times in police investigations was dedicated to aspirit named Membrock or Manbrok. It was reported that in1700the treasurehunter L’abb\u0002e Le Fevre, a Capuchin monk who hadXed his monastery in96|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Compie`gne, baptized a grimoire in the name of Manbrok. This act was performedin the church of Noyen-sur-Seine, a village southeast of Paris. A circle was madearound the altar with blessed chalk, and Mass was performed on three successivenights. La du Castel, a Parisian seller of love potions, was also much occupied withattempting to conjure up a spirit named ‘Membrok’, presumably one and the sameas Manbrok.19One wonders whether some of these grimoires conWscated on the orders ofd’Argenson found their way into the vast library of his grandson, the marquisMarc AntoineRen\u0002e de Voyer d’Argenson, which formed the basis of the greatFrench national library theBibliothe`que de l’Arsenal. Amongst this bibliophile’scollection of manuscripts were four versions of theClavicule of Solomon, one copyeach of theEnchiridion du Pape Le ́onand theGrimoire du Pape Honorius, theArmadel, and one attributed to ‘Tosgrec’, in other words Toz Graecus, the fabledauthor of several medieval occult books.20The vibrant magical world of early-eighteenth-century Paris was well knownto Laurent Bordelon (1653–1710), satirist and chaplain of St Eustache in Paris.21He mixed in the intellectual and aristocratic circles that were in Louis XIV’sfavour after the AVair of the Poisons. At a more humble level he must have heardrumours about the various treasure-hunting clergymen operating in the city. Onepresumes that it was, in part, this that led him to write, shortly before his death, ahumorous critique of the belief in witchcraft, magic, divination, and apparitionsbased around the opinions and adventures of Monsieur OuXe—OuXe being LeFou (‘the fool’) spelt backwards. Constant reading of ‘superstitious books’ hadtainted OuXe’s mind, and made him exceedingly credulous on matters regardingthe supernatural. His belief in magic was also transmitted to his sons. One of themwas a timid priest too honest to turn to magicians. The other, a bank worker, was,however, seduced by the prospect of obtaining the great riches held out byconjurers and astrologers: ‘When they spoke to him of Devils that couldWndtreasures, his mouth watered so much that he would not send them away.’22Bordelon dedicated a chapter to listing the books in OuXe’s library, the best partof which consisted of the works of well-known witch-hunters such as theMalleusMalliWcarum, Bodin’sDe la de ́monomanie des sorciers, and Boguet’sDiscours dessorciers. These rubbed alongside several grimoires—the books that such demon-ologists as Bodin and Boguet denounced and burned. OuXe owned theGrandandPetit Albert, theEnchiridion, Clavicule of Solomon, and a grimoire that carried asignature of the Devil at the end. By including both genres in OuXe’s libraryBordelon was making the point that they were essentially the same in the sensethat they were founded on credulity and fanned pernicious superstition. Despitesuch mockery and the vigilance of the Paris police, France was set to become theEuropean centre of grimoire production, with global cultural consequences.Enlightenment and Treasure|97"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"It was during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that the cheap,simple literary format known as theBibliothe`que bleueexpanded in France.

This was also the area of the country that experiencedthe biggest increases in literacy during the eighteenth century.24It must beremembered also that many people in France at the time spoke languages anddialects other than French, and, therefore, the popular inXuence of this cheapliterature varied widely from region to region.The role ofcolporteursor peddlers was certainly crucial to the spread ofgrimoires around the country. They were not mere salesmen though. In theirpacks they carried knowledge—knowledge from other places, other worlds. Theyhad a reputation for knowing a thing or two about magic and medicine, bornpartly of their possession of grimoires and almanacs, partly because of the mystiquethat accrued to them as strangers from unknown lands.Colporteursfrom Oisans, atthe foot of the Alps, for instance, were known throughout France for themountain herbs they oVered for sale.25The popularity of theBibliothe`que bleuewas a headache for the secular andreligious authorities. Laws were instituted and reinforced to suppress literatureconsidered politically and religiously pernicious, and to monitor the activities ofcolporteurs. It is not surprising, then, that the publishers of grimoires were loath toidentify themselves. A favourite ruse was to hide behind theWctional publishingcompany of Beringos Fratres of Lyon, whose premises were located ‘at the sign ofAgrippa’.26This was a tradition that stretched back to the publication of Frencheditions of Agrippa and pseudo-Agrippan works during the sixteenth and seven-teenth centuries. Most grimoires were given bogus dates of publication andspurious places of publication likeRome or Memphis. These served the dualpurpose of frustrating the censors and giving the grimoires an aura of venerableauthority and foreign mystery. They also make it impossible for the historian todate them accurately.The earliest magic book in theBibliothe`que bleuegenre was theGrand Albert.Itmay have been available in printed versions for nearly two centuries, but as part oftheBibliothe`que bleueits publication generated fresh concerns. In1709state censorslisted it as a book to be condemned and conWscated, along with a raft of populistreligious works printed inRouen.27Soon, though, theGrand Albert’s littlebrother, thePetit Albert, a true grimoire, would rise to even greater notoriety. It98|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"was not attributed to Albertus Magnus, though, but instead to one Albertus ParvusLucius. The earliest reference I have found to a magical text of this name is ind’Argenson’s report of1702, in which it is noted that the principal grimoire of themagicianRadeville was ‘Le petit Albert ou le paysan’.28This was presumably amanuscript and one wonders whether it, or a variant of it, was the origin of theWrst mass-produced version. An edition of thePetit Albertis thought to haveappeared in Geneva in1704, though the earliest known French edition waspublished in1706under the imprint of Beringos Fratres.29As Bordelon’s accountof Monsieur OuXe’s library suggests, by1710thePetit Alberthad already become anotorious and successfully popular grimoire in the Paris region. In1714a travel-ling salesman named Ponce Millet, who hawked cloth, clothing, and booksaround northeastern France, gave a copy of thePetit Albert, at three livres quitean expensive book, to his brother-in-law in the Champagne region.30Over theFig.4Edition ofLe Petit Albert, title page.Enlightenment and Treasure|99"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"next few decades its inXuence spread all over France. Acolporteurarrested inLanguedoc in1745, for instance, was found to be in possession of several copies.31It is somewhat ironic that these early copies of thePetit Albertare now so rare thatthey fetch upwards of a thousand pounds.ThePetit Albertcontained a mix of mundane and magical knowledge. Therewere the practical tips common tosecrets of secrets, such as how to fortify wine andmake vinegar, and medical advice for bad stomachs, urinary problems, fever, badbreath, and the like. Then there were patriarchal occult tips regarding the controlof females, such as how to know whether a woman is chaste, how to makewomen dance naked, and how to prevent women from talking lewdly withsomeone. There were charms to ensure success atWshing, such as taking threelimpet shells, writing on them in blood the words ‘JA SABAOTH’, and throwingthem in the water. It also contained planetary talismans and number squares, andrecipes for magical perfumes. Its most notorious piece of magic concerned themaking of the Hand of Glory, which allowed thieves to enter houses at nightwithout being caught by stupefying the inhabitants. It instructed the reader to cutthe hand oVa criminal who had been gibbeted, wrap it in a burial sheet, thensqueeze all the blood out of it. The hand was to be kept in an earthen pot forWfteen days along with a preservative mix including saltpetre, salt, and poundedpeppercorns. It was then to be dried by the heat of the sun or in an oven. ThemummiWed hand was to be used to hold a candle made from the fat of a hangedman and virgin wax in a manner illustrated by a woodcut. Variants of thisgruesome magical object were known about and apparently put into practiceduring the seventeenth century, but it was thePetit Albertthat generated thenineteenth- and twentieth-centuries fascination with the tradition.32Bibliothe`que bleueeditions of that favourite magic book of the Parisian conjurers,theGrimoire du Pape Honorius,Wrst appeared towards the end of the eighteenthcentury. Some of its contents were copied straight from thePetit Albert, includingdetails of the Hand of Glory. Where it diVered markedly from thePetit Albertwasthe series of spirit conjurations it contained, which were evidently taken from oneof the numerous manuscript versions of theGrimoirein circulation. One sign ofthis is the two conjurations it contains to command a spirit named Nambrot,which is presumably one and the same as the spirit Membrock or Manbroksummoned by early-eighteenth-century Parisian magicians. The basis of thebook’s popularity was its utility for treasure hunting, providing ‘pentacles todiscover treasures’ and conjurations to deal with the spirit world. ThePetit Albertcontained some discussion on the location of buried treasures, and the sala-manders, gnomes, and spirits said to guard them, but little practical advice.33The author of theGrimoire du Pape Honoriusclearly saw a gap in the market.100|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"TheBibliothe`que bleueversion of that other Parisian favourite, theEnchiridionLeonis Papæ, also appeared in the same period.34It contained the usual simplehealing charms, a version of the apocryphal Abgarus letter, and, in the earliesteditions, a set of rather handsome colour engravings of talismans and instructionson constructing pentacles. Its deWning content, though, was its series of talismanicprotective prayers. Some versions of thePetit Albertrecommended the prayers intheEnchiridionto those confronted by spirits when digging for treasure.35Butthere were prayers for more mundane purposes, such as the following to ward oVfoxes:Say three times a week: in the name of the Fatherþ, and of the Sonþ,and of the Holy Ghostþ. Foxes and Vixens, I conjure you, in the nameof the virgin and saint, as Our Lady was pregnant, that you will neithertake nor scatter any of my birds, myXocks, that is to say cocks, hens orchickens, nor eat their nests, nor suck their blood, nor break their eggs,nor do any harm to them, etc.Another to be ‘hard’, and perhaps meant to counter impotency, was diabolic:Write on two pieces of paper, with your blood, that which follows:Ranucþ, Malinþ, Fora consummatum est, in te confedo, Satanaþ;swallow one of them, and carry the other around the neck.During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries theGrimoire du PapeHonoriusand theEnchiridionwere joined by such familiar works asLes ve ́ritablesclavicules de Salomonand theOeuvres magiques d’Henri Corneille Agrippa, as well asother more minor titles. In terms of popular inXuence, though, all these wereovershadowed by theGrand grimoire, which was theWrst explicitly diabolic mass-market grimoire. While theWrst edition has usually been dated to1702—beforethePetit Albert—its absence from early-eighteenth-century sources suggests that aBibliothe`que bleueedition published around1750was theWrst, or at least the mostinXuential. TheGrand grimoirewas sensational and dangerous in that it gave explicitinstructions on how to call up and make a pact with the Devil’s prime minister inHell, Lucifug\u0002eRofocale. Satan had given Lucifug\u0002e powers over all the riches andtreasures in the world, and so for French treasure hunters he was the mostimportant of spirits. TheGrand grimoireprovided all the instructions, conjurations,and advice required to seal the pact. The ‘Great Call’ of Lucifug\u0002e began:Emperor LUCIFER, master of all the rebel spirits, I beg you to favour mein the call that I am making to your grand minister LUCIFUGE ́ROFO-CALE, desiring to make a pact with him; I beg you also, prince Beelze-bub, to protect me in my undertaking.

In1804, the sameyear that Napoleon crowned himself Emperor, a trial in Amiens deliberated onthe case of a man found with a grimoire, most likely theGrand grimoire, withwhich he said he could call up the Devil by merely touching it. A governmentoYcial opened the book in public to demonstrate that this was absurd nonsense.Fig.6Le grand grimoire. Eighteenth-century imprint.Enlightenment and Treasure|103"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"When the Devil failed to appear the man exclaimed that the oYcial must be amore skilful magician than he to so silence Satan.36The founders of the FrenchRepublic espoused the advancement of rationalism, and the state’s anticlericalismwas inspired, in part, by a desire to banish the ‘superstitions’ promoted by theCatholic Church. The scene in the Amiens court could be seen as representativeof the process of popular enlightenment and dechristianization some associatedwith theRepublic. On the other hand, it could also be seen as indicative of a waveof superstition unleashed by theRevolution. People faltered from the true path ofChristian piety and moral sensibilities, leading to an era when blasphemous magicXourished. Several clergymen writing in the1790s claimed theRevolution was adiabolic Freemason conspiracy. For one evangelical campaigner, a century and ahalf later, the publication in the early nineteenth century of a new version of theGrand grimoireunder the title of theDragon rougewas symptomatic: ‘After theFrench revolution in1789, a revolution aimed at dethroning God and enthroningthe goddess of reason, this particular book, The Fiery Dragon, became a sinistersubstitute to the Bible in some French magic circles.’37But while magic certainlyremained as strong a force in popular culture as it had done in the years before andafter the revolutionary period, for the vast majority of Frenchmen and women theChurch also maintained its grip on the masses.38TheDragon rougewent on to match thePetit Albertfor notoriety. Writing in themid-nineteenth century, the historian Charles Nisard described its ‘monstrous’ and‘bizarre’Wgures as ‘breathing an atmosphereWlled withWre, sulphur and bitumen’. Italso inspired a work of the same title that was, in fact, an attack on its perniciousinXuence and that of other cheap grimoires.39While thePetit Alberthad gained itsinXuence through the travels of thecolporteurs,theDragon rougeproWted from thegrowth of High Street bookshops during the nineteenth century. One commenta-tor, writing in1861, noted sadly that it was on open sale in the shop windows of Paris,‘to the great scandal of those who think we are progressing’.40Other sources conWrmthat booksellers had no qualms about openly selling and advertising such magicalmerchandise. In1818the avid bibliophile Thomas Frognall Dibdin was sold a copyof theDragon rougeduring an antiquarian tour of France and Germany. While visitingNancy he asked a bookseller and printer if he ‘had any thing old and curious?’ Thebookseller explained that he had once possessed a splendid medieval missal, thenhanded him a copy of theDragon rouge, saying, ‘see, Sir, is not this curious? . . . buy it,and read it—it will amuse you—and it costs onlyWve sous.’ Dibdin purchased twocopies, partly it seems, because he found the frontispiece image of the Devilintriguing. The bookseller informed him that he regularly sold hundreds of copiesto the country people.41In October1823, the year that a very successful edition oftheDragon rougewas produced in Nıˆmes, a religious periodical published in its ‘caseof conscience’ section a letter that had recently been received by a Parisian bookseller104|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Fig.7List of devils and spirits fromLe dragon rouge(early nineteenth-century edition)."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"from a correspondent in Normandy.42It explained how one of his friends had beento the man’s bookshop with a soldier garrisoned at Versailles, and bought a copy oftheDragon rouge. The bookseller had told them that he could obtain other morepowerful works including a French version of Girolamo Menghi’s sixteenth-centuryexorcism manualLe Flagellum dæmonumand theClavicule of Solomon. The corres-pondent went on to request one such book that would punish evildoers, avowingthat he would travel many leagues to obtain it. Needless to say, the pious editor of theclerical periodical denounced the interest in and supply of grimoires.43A spin-oVfrom one of the conjurations in theDragon rougewasLa poule noire,theWrst known edition of which appeared in1820. Its popularity was due to thetreasure conjuring ritual of the same name which was notorious in eighteenth-century France. There were several variations of the tradition. One required thereleasing of a black hen at the treasure site and then sacriWcing it. Anotherconsisted of the sacriWce of a black hen at a crossroads or cross around midnightin conjunction with a conjuration to call up the Devil. His eminence would, inreturn, proVer a black hen that laid gold or silver eggs.Rumour had it that thewealth of the inXuential French banker Samuel Bernard (1651–1739) was due tohis possession of one such black hen.44There is no doubt that the ritual waspractised, as was revealed during the trial in1775of a winegrower named JeanGuillery and several accomplices. These fraudsters gulled at least two men withthe promise of apoule noirethat laid money. In one instance they began by askingtheir dupe, a man named Fortier, to write his name on a book owned by anaccomplice named Macret, which Fortier described as a grimoire full of strangeWgures. They led him to a cross in the countryside around the village of Pithiviers,near Orl\u0002eans. Macret gave his grimoire to Guillery, and following its instructionsthey spread out a napkin at the foot of the cross. Then, sixty steps from it theydrew a circle on the ground in which Fortier was ordered to stand until toldotherwise. Guillery placed Fortier’s money on the napkin, got down on one kneein supplication, and said ‘I greet you, my master.’ On saying this, a hen appearedon the napkin, but when Guillery repeated his salutation to the Devil it disap-peared along with the money. Meanwhile one of the accomplices rolled aroundon the ground pretending to be possessed. Guillery walked back to Fortier whoremained in the protective circle and informed him that the Devil had snatchedthe money, and it would require more money to go through the ritual again toprocure thepoule noire. Fortier complied, and after they all said a neuvaine(reciting the same prayer nine days in a row) they went through the wholecharade once more. Several of the gang were sentenced to be pilloried, whipped,branded, and banished. One was tied to the pillory post in the public square inPithiviers on three consecutive market days wearing a paper with the words‘Swindler by false magic’.45106|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Who else purchased the thousands of grimoires being produced? We cannotassume that it was only the literate. The mere possession of non-diabolic grimoireswas thought by some to have a protective function. When, in1815, a vintner andherbal healer named Pierre Belloc was arrested at a Bayonne inn for practising falsemedicine, they found on him a copy of theEnchiridion Leonis papæ. He said he hadbought it from a soldier ‘who assured him that it would shield him from falling illand being killed’.46Those who could read we can divide into the merely curiousand the practitioners. Amongst the former during the mid-eighteenth century wasan adventurous, itinerant master glassier named Jacques-Louis M\u0002en\u0002etra. His copyof thePetit Albertjoined a modest list of books we know he also owned, namelythe Bible, a spiritual text, and two works byRousseau. There is no indication inM\u0002en\u0002etra’s confessional journal that he dabbled in magic, and he was clearlysceptical of the spirit world, so we can only assume that the rumours surroundingthePetit Albertintrigued him.47As to the practitioners, we should not presume that they were all interested inconjurations and spells, as mostBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires also contained simple,pious healing charms and natural recipes. In one edition of theGrimoire du PapeHonoriusweWnd the following charm for ringworm, which, like numerous othersfor minor ailments, is based on apocryphal biblical events:Saint Peter, on the bridge of God, sat down; Our Lady of Caly camethere, and asked him: Peter, what are you doing there? Lady, it is for thehurt of my master that I placed myself there. St Peter, you will remove it;to Saint Ager you will go for it; you will take the holy ointment of themortal wounds of our Lord; you will grease them and you will say threetimes: Jesus Mary. It is necessary to make the sign of the cross three timesover the head.48Charms such as these for staunching blood, toothache, snakebites, eye complaints,and the like were normally only eYcacious when employed by those thought topossess a special gift for charming. So even though theBibliothe`que bleuegrimoiresand theMe ́decin des pauvres, a popular nineteenth-century chapbook of healingcharms, were available to all for a few pennies, not everyone could use them.49AsFrench anthropologists, folklorists, and sociologists have shown, many charmersdid not practise other forms of magic and were devout churchgoers. Spiritconjuration and making women dance naked were not for them. They were,however, for the more unscrupulous cunning-folk.In1776Franc ̧ois Duthil, known familiarly as Minette, a former miller ofCernoy, east of Beauvais, was tried for a series of frauds practised over a coupleof decades on the inhabitants of the villages and towns of Picardie. Much of hisprofessed power lay in his grimoires. These were small enough to be kept in hisEnlightenment and Treasure|107"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"pocket, which suggests that they were members of theBibliothe`que bleue. One ofhis victims, a young woman named Agne`s de Larche, whom he made pregnantand then abandoned, testiWed that healways had two books with him, which he took great care to hide. Heread often from one of the two, and said to me, sometimes crying, ‘thisbook is the cause of our misfortune.’ When we entered a town, he hidone of them in his trousers, and gave the other one to me to hide; andwhen we were ready for bed, he placed them under the mattress, sayingto me they were grimoires, and that, if they found them on him, theywould not honour him with hanging, but that he would be burned.50Whether Duthil’s emotional outbursts were an act is impossible to say. If genuine,then it may have been the case that Duthil had employed one of them, perhaps theGrand grimoire, to make a pact with the Devil. He certainly played on his professedfamiliarity with the Lord of Darkness. He told one of his victims, a labourernamed Toussaint Demont, whom, over a period of two years, he swindled out ofmost of his money with repeated attempts to conjure hidden treasure, that theDevil had written to him regarding its location. Agne`s testiWed that when sheinformed Duthil she was pregnant ‘he told me only that the Devil was tormentinghim so that I would give up my child to him, and continually requested me toconsent to this sacriWce.’51This sounds like a wickedly cynical ruse to destroy thetroublesome illegitimate child. In August1776Duthil was branded and sent to thegalleys for life.The folklore and trial records of the nineteenth century show howWrmlycemented theBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires had become in the fabric of France’stradition of popular magic. The reputations of cunning-folk depended on them.During the trial in Agen of a wise woman namedRose P\u0002ere`sin1829, for instance, itwas heard how as part of her ritual for curing the child of a rich peasant she laiddown in front of him ‘with a grave and mysterious air, the well-known book ofPetit Albert’. Around the same time a couple of magicians defrauded an old womannear Niort after impressing her with their copies of theDragon rouge,Petit Albert,andGrand grimoire. Later in the century a witness at the trial of a disreputablesorcerer named Gaucher testiWed that he was afraid of him because ‘he told me heowned thePetit Albertand other books, which enabled him to do anything heliked.’52The vast majority of those consulting cunning-folk in the early modernperiod would have known nothing of the titles of the grimoires displayed toimpress them. The possession of books, particularly large ones, or manuscriptswith arcane symbols, was enough to convince that they were adepts in theoccult arts. The spread of literacy and popular literature meant that, by themid-nineteenth century, thePetit Albert,Grand Albert, andDragon rougewere108|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"household names. To say one had thePetit Albertwas shorthand for saying one wasdeep in magic.Feeling their spiritual authority challenged by the widespread inXuence of theBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires, the clergy launched a counter-oVensive aimed atdemonizing them. They spread the message that those who possessed or evendesired such books, let alone used them, were committing a grave blasphemy.Reading was a dangerous act.53A perusal of the folklore collections of the latenineteenth and twentieth centuries suggests the clergy met with considerablesuccess. In1884, for instance, a letter inThe Timesrecalled a conversation with awoman in Tours: ‘She spoke of the ‘‘Petit Albert’’ with the utmost horror, and toldme that the priests said that merely to look into it was a great sin, and that the devilhad the power to seize any one while in the act of reading it.’54A study of witchcraftbeliefs in twentieth-century Languedoc found that such statements were maderepeatedly by those interviewed. When asked about thePetit Albert, one personsaid, ‘It is forbidden to talk about it, the Church has forbidden it. It is a dangerousbook.’ When another told his grandmother, ‘I am going to buy the Petit Albert,’she replied, ‘You are mad! It is forbidden by religion . . . It will make you ill.’55The inXuence of theBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires stretched far beyond theFrench border. France’s southern neighbours tried to stem the tide. ThePetitAlbertwas added to the SpanishIndex of Prohibited Booksin1782, and twenty-twoyears later the1800edition of theGrimoire du pape Honoriuswas also included.56But theIndexwas a fairly redundant tool of censorship by now. In1820a Florencebookseller was openly oVering French editions of thePetit AlbertandGrand Albert,despite their presence on theIndex, as well as recent editions ofLe Grand grimoireandLe Dragon rouge.57In the absence of similar chapbook grimoires in Italy,publishers there turned to the French genre, and in1868theDragon rougewastranslated into Italian asIl Vero drago rosso. By this time it had already permeatedGerman magic under the titleDer wahrhaftige, feurige Drache(The true,Wery Dragon).To the north, French grimoires became engrained in the magical traditions of theBritish Channel Islands and parts of the Low Countries. In1854it was estimatedthat in the Ardennes region alone as many as400,000chapbook grimoires were incirculation—surely an exaggeration, but nevertheless indicative of how muchthey had infused into the popular consciousness.58Satan’s Alpine seatFrance may have been the centre of European grimoire printing, but for manysouthern European Catholics during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,Geneva was the capital of diabolic magic, joining Salamanca and Toledo in theEnlightenment and Treasure|109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"geography of occult learning. As trial records show, people travelled to Genevafrom across France, Spain, and Italy in search of magic books and familiar spirits.The city was a major centre of publishing, but its occult reputation was dueprimarily to it being a centre of Protestantism, the heartland of Calvinism. Froma Catholic point of view it was consequently portrayed as a wellspring of diabolicheresy, a place where the Devil reigned amongst his Protestant disciples. For Italiansit was the nearest inXuential state free from the reach of the Catholic Church.In1744one Nicolas Lambert played what he called a ‘good trick’ on somevisiting Italians seeking magical help. They had asked him whether they couldWnd thePetit Albertin Geneva, which, they explained, ‘was a very useful book forobtaining riches’. Lambert told them that thePetit Albertwas a paltry itemcompared to the power granted to those who possessed a familiar spirit that hecould procure for them. One of his dupes was Bartholomeo Bernardi from Luccain Tuscany. He had inquired of Lambert, ‘if in this country there weren’t peoplewho were given to magic, that is to sayWnding spirits, as in Italy’. More to thepoint, he wondered ‘if there weren’t in this town books which were forbidden bythe Holy OYce, and through which one could obtain great advantages’. Lambertintimated that they had, indeed, come to the right place.Rather than purchase acopy of thePetit Albert, Lambert convinced him to buy a box containing what hesaid was a spirit, as well as an invocation in Italian to control it.59Bernardi soonrealized he had been defrauded and despite the risk went to the authorities. TheItalians were ordered to leave the city and Lambert was banished for life.One of those making a living from selling grimoires in the famed market in thePlace du Molard was Louise Chartier, wife of a printer named Odet Jacques. In1716the authorities conWscated two manuscripts entitled, ‘SanctumRegnum seuPneumatologia Salomonis, with some other loose leaves from the same book, whichexplain the nature of the Devil, hisWgure, his diVerent names, his power, thenumber of his oYcers’. Chartier confessed that she had paid a Savoyard to makecopies. Several decades later, copies of theClavicula Salomoniswere being pro-duced by a group of conspirators made up of an innkeeper named CharlesEmpeyta, a bookseller Pierre Lombard, a school master Jacques Dueros, andJacques Minot, an artist. Judging from the experience of a young man who wasstaying at Empeyta’s hotel with his aunt, the innkeeper acted as the inveiglingagent for Lombard. Empeyta persuaded the young man that Lombard possessed amanuscript that would make his fortune. For the price of two gold Louis, and acommission for Empeyta’s service on top, he received hisClavicule, which con-sisted of eighty-eight pages written in red and black ink by Ducros, who hadcopied it from an ‘original’ he had previously sold. At the end of the manuscriptwas a picture of the Devil in red crayon drawn by Minot. The outWt had also soldcopies of the same to people from Italy, Lyon, and Languedoc.60110|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"By this time theGrand grimoirehad joined thePetit Albertas a publishingsensation.

Carret soon regrettedhis decision after a friend opened the book and declared that it contained nothingmore than a lot of ‘twaddle’.61Delving further into the court records reveals that the authorities were keen toWnd out where theGrand grimoiresold by Mori\u0002e had been printed. A booksellerwas called to give testimony on the subject. ‘Having examined the print andcharacters of the said book,’ he concluded, ‘I have found nothing which makes mebelieve that this book might have been printed in Geneva, and I think I can stateto the contrary, that it is impossible to determine in what place the said book wasprinted.’62Fortunately Carret’s copy was kept by the authorities and survivestoday in the dossier on the case. An inspection conWrms that, although bearing thebogus date of1603, it was a copy of the French edition published around1750.Ithad also been used, presumably by Carret, to make a pact with the Devil.

He teamed upwith two French treasure seekers, a leather worker named Jean de la Guarriguefrom Quercy and AntoineRiccard from near Toulouse. According to the twoFrenchmen, Agilar had convinced them of their quest by relating how a Jesuitpriest had informed him that in Geneva he couldWnd books of magic and the‘characters’ of the ‘Prince of Devils’, which would drive away the minordemons that guarded treasures. The three men arrived in the capital of CalvinismEnlightenment and Treasure|111"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"via Lyon in1672. Agilar set about searchingWrst for a copy of theVirtutes Herbarumby Albertus Magnus, in other words theGrand Albert, from which he wanted tolearn the magical properties of herbs and stones. Then they tried to obtain from ashopkeeper books that would call up the Devil to aid them in their treasure quest.Shortly after, someone informed on them and they were arrested. They claimed atWrst that their travels were nothing more than a simple desire ‘to see the world andforeign countries’. Over a century later another Spanish priest, Juan Soler, wasdirectly involved in similar treasure endeavours that led to Geneva. Soler boastedto his treasure-seeking companions that he had procured, on the advice of theDevil, a book of conjurations from Geneva. He said he had bought it during arecord-breaking48-hour round trip from the Catalonian town of Girona. Thesame treasure-hunting group subsequently turned to a Frenchman to lead them.64As we have seen, until its disbandment in1820, the Spanish Inquisitionexpended much eVort rooting out grimoires, and numerous copies were conWs-cated during the two hundred or so cases of treasure seeking the Inquisitioninvestigated between1700and1820.65The SpanishIndexlisted the addition, in1817, of a manuscript called the ‘Book of conjurations for obtaining treasures’. Itjoined another manuscript described as containing ‘rules, conjurations and exor-cisms to discover and to extract occult treasures’.66It is understandable that Agilarfelt it safer to take the arduous journey north rather than try and obtain one athome. Across the border in Portugal the secular authorities were also active incensoring publishers, with new regulations being instituted in1768to ban booksthat promoted ‘superstition’.67Yet, despite the attentions of Church and state,grimoires continued to circulate throughout the Iberian Peninsula. A majorreason for this was the porous boundary between France and Spain, in particularthe Basque region straddling the western Pyrenees. In1785an Inquisitor orderedthat the sentence against a ‘superstitious’ treasure seeker be read in the church ofMercadal, east of Santander, to warn people of the iniquity of the oVence, whichhe thought was more rife in the Bishopric than elsewhere ‘because of the closeproximity with France’.68The French inXuence permeated to further parts of thecountry. The Zaragoza tribunal dealt with a healer who said she learnt herknowledge from the book of a French doctor. It also heard another case inwhich the defendant related that a Frenchwoman had told him that treasurecould be found by releasing a black hen at the spot were the treasure was hiddenand then oVering it to the Devil. Frenchmen were also implicated in several casesof treasure hunting heard by the Inquisition during the century.69In the eighteenth century Bayonne in particular had a reputation amongstSpaniards as a centre of magical practice second only to Geneva. This was in partbecause it was the nearest large French town to the western Spanish border, andtherefore the most likely place to be able to obtain thePetit AlbertandGrand112|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"grimoire. It was also due to the town having a well-knownmarranosand Jewishpopulation.Marranoswere Spanish and Portuguese converted Jews (‘NewChristians’) whoXed the attentions of the Spanish Inquisition and who were,following a French royal edict of1555, allowed to settle in the territory ofthe Bordeaux Parliament, which stretched to the Spanish border. By the earlyeighteenth century the Jewish faith was being openly practised in the town,predominantly by new arrivals, despite the heavy restrictions on them institutedby the Bayonne authorities. Meanwhile back in Spain the Inquisition launchedanother major wave of suppression against converted Jews during the1720s,leading to further movements ofmarranosacross the border.70A case heard bythe Zaragoza tribunal demonstrates the attraction of Bayonne for Spanish seekersof magical knowledge. In1740a shoemaker named Andr\u0002es Jaso visited the townand consulted a Jewish magician in order to learn how to conjure up familiars ordemons that would aid his personal enrichment. He naturally returned disap-pointed, and subsequently went to Geneva on the same quest.71By the mid-eighteenth century thePetit Albertwas already inXuential amongstcunning-folk in southwestern France. In1742a copy was conWscated along with abook of exorcisms and various medical texts from a ‘so-called surgeon’ namedJean Labadie, and a copy was found on a ‘pretended’ B\u0002earnaise magician in1783.72When, in the1760s, the authorities of Dax arrested the magician anditinerant house painter Dominique Lalanne they found a manuscript ofLesve ́ritables clavicules de Salomon. He was also accused of having obtained a copy ofDelRio’sDisquisitionum Magicarum. The authorities, ignorant of the nature of thebook, evidently thought it suspicious.73But it would seem that the usual gri-moires had a rival in the region—theAgrippa Noiror Black Agrippa. In hisunpublished memoirs, written in1744, Mathieu du Bourg Caune`gre, a townsmanof Magescq, referred to an ‘Agrippa le Noir with all theWgures’, when discussingwith a friend what he should consult to make a spirit appear.74The Pyreneangeographer Franc ̧ois Flamichon, writing during the1780s, related a legend ofMoorish treasure hidden in a cave near the village of Esquiule. Villagers had failedtoWnd it and so called in a Jewish conjurer from Saint-Esprit, a Jewish suburb ofBayonne, who said he could get his hands on an ‘Agrippa le Noir’. He chargedthem a considerable sum for his services and absconded with their hard-earnedmoney, leaving his dupes to wait in vain for his return.75We know such agrimoire really existed in the region for weWnd a copy ofAgrippa le Noiramongthe books and manuscripts conWscated from Dominique Lalanne. From theprosecution of an itinerant magician and doctor named Gracien Detcheverrywe also know that it circulated beyond the French-speaking community.Born in the Basque region around1700Gracien Detcheverry, unlike most ofhis kind, was a formally trained and licensed surgeon.76He plied his trade andEnlightenment and Treasure|113"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"mixed in dubious company both sides of the Pyrenees. It was during a visit to thehome of a Spaniard in the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz in1733that he caught sightof a manuscript in Spanish entitled ‘Agripa Negra’. He bought it for the consid-erable sum of seventy-Wve livres, and with it his career as a conjurer began inearnest. Armed with his grimoire he professed to be able toWnd treasure and openthe doors of prisons, amongst other magical feats. He was arrested in Bayonne forhis nefarious activities and found guilty. Detcheverry’s ‘Agripa Negra’ was burnedpublicly in the Place Notre-Dame, and he was sentenced to the galleys for the restof his life. The court, however, ordered that a translation of the grimoire be madeso that they could better judge its contents, and this copy survives in the archives.It is nineteen pages long and is primarily dedicated to treasure hunting. It consistsof a compilation of conjurations and receipts from several grimoires. More to thepoint it is not a straight copy of anything in print at the time. Several of itsconjurations, such as one for the ‘Rois d’Orient’, are clearly from theGrimoire duPape Honorius, as is a conjuration for the spirit ‘Nembrot’.77This does not meanthat allAgrippa le Noirswere the same or similar to Detcheverry’s, but it representsa distinct regional tradition that crossed linguistic and political frontiers.Further south in Spain the old Moorish inXuence lingered, with Arabic magictexts being much sought after. In1730the Inquisition tried an old illiterate manfrom Carlet, near Valencia, who owned a book in Arabic that instructed that twoslaves had to be present when searching for treasure. These he bought and thenbrought to the treasure site where he sacriWced a kid goat. When nothinghappened he cut the arms of one of the slaves so that they bled on the spot. InMajorca several decades later a treasure hunter was found with a little bookwritten in Moorish language that contained magical ‘triangles’.78During the nineteenth century a new and inXuential addition to the canon ofpopular grimoires was born—theLibro de San Cipriano(The Book of St Ciprian).The usual bogus claims were made as to its authorship. Some editions claimed thata German monk named Jonas Sufurino, the librarian of the monastery of Broo-ken, discovered or wrote it in the year1000. Popular legend had it that theoriginal manuscript was safely locked away in the university or cathedral library inthe Galician capital Santiago.79Although modern editions claimed an initialpublication date of1510, there is, in fact, no mention in Spanish sources of agrimoire with such a title until1802, when the Inquisition prosecuted a priest forpossessing a manuscript called theLibro de San Cipriano, which he used toWndburied treasure.80The papalIndex, however, had long included ‘prayers ascribedto S. Cipriano’ against evil spirits, incantations, witchcraft, and any other adver-sity.81SigniWcantly their use was evidently widespread in southwestern Franceduring the eighteenth century. In1753the Bishop of Oloron warned against the‘pretended exorcisms of Saint Cyprien that are to be found in the hands of some in114|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"our diocese’. It consisted of a prayer to Christ in which, amongst other things, heis beseeched to protect people from the ‘evil eyes of demons and from theirhearing, from deceiving tongues, from thunder, from lightening, from storms,from all sort of enemies and evil spirits’.82It is easy to imagine that, at the time,Cyprian’s name might be added to a manuscript version of theGrand grimoireorGrimoire du Pape Honorius. In fact extracts from a manuscriptLibro de San Ciprianopublished by a Galician historian in1885contain a Spanish version of theGrandgrimoire’s instructions for addressing Lucifug\u0002eRofocale.83In a French trial of1841weWnd an intriguing reference to a book printed inFrench and Latin entitledCyprien Mago ante Conversionem. Its spurious place anddate of publication was ‘Salamanca1460’. It contained various ‘magic, cabbalist anddiabolical’ images, and instructions on how to obtain a treasure of eighteen millionwith the help of the Devil. It was owned by a gunsmith, Jean Grang\u0002e, from nearToulouse, who inherited it from his father. Seduced by the prospect of huge wealthGrang\u0002e consulted a local sorcerer, named Lagrange, on how best to use the book,and was advised that to proceed it would beWrst necessary to procure the Devil’ssignature. Grang\u0002e was hooked and the sorcerer orchestrated an elaborate hoaxconjuration of the Devil which involved an accomplice dressed in red trousers anda black lambskin helmet in imitation of his satanic highness. Despite being in a foulmood the Devil signed a piece of parchment and received a fee before exiting.84I have not been able to trace any surviving copies of theCyprien Mago anteConversionem. It was almost certainly a localBibliothe`que bleuepublication, andconWrms that a Cyprian treasure grimoire had been printed and circulated insouthwest France before it had in Spain. Yet it is quite possible that theCyprienMagowas an example of theXow of magical culture from Spain to France with aFrench printer being inspired by a manuscriptLibro de San Cipriano.The publication of Spanish books with the titleLibro de San Ciprianoonlybegan in the late nineteenth century.85Two distinct genres emerged.86Oneversion of theLibro de San Ciprianowas essentially a translation of the FrenchGrand grimoire. A Spanish edition of the latter, theGran Grimoirio, had apparentlyappeared in1820, and this may have led to a further proliferation of manuscriptversions under the Cipriano name. In the1840s, furthermore, one Spanishbookseller, and no doubt others, was also selling the Nıˆmes edition of theDragonrouge, copies of which may have also been transcribed and circulated under theCiprianoname.87The second genre of theLibro de San Ciprianowas a distinctivelySpanish creation rather than a comprehensive borrowing from the French trad-ition. It was not concerned with diabolic invocations but rather containedexorcisms and prayers for dispelling demons, healing the sick,Wnding lostitems, and providing protection against the evil eye. Some editions of the bookeven advised that it was intended to help the clergy in aiding their parishioners.Enlightenment and Treasure|115"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"What undoubtedly most attracted readers, though, were the instructions on howto obtain hidden treasureswithoutrecourse to the Devil. This could be achieved bydrawing a magical circle at the spot, entering, and praying to God, the saints, andthe angels, while reciting sacred names. The key to the success of thisLibro de SanCiprianowas that it also provided a detailed list of the places in Galicia wheretreasure could be found.Why Galicia? The popularity and knowledge of theLibro de San Ciprianowasparticularly strong in the province, and in neighbouring Asturias, where it waspopularly known as theCiprianillo. Its cultural inXuence is evident from itspresence in the literary canon of the region. The Galician poet Manuel CurrosEnriquez (1851–1908) wrote a poem entitledO Ciprianillo, while in one of thenovels of his compatriot, the dramatist and novelistRamo ́n del Valle-Incla ́n(1866–1936), there is a passage in which an old man tries toWnd some treasureby reading from a magic book entitled theLibro de San Cidrian(an obviousreference to the Cypriano) by candlelight after sunset.88The region is rich inprehistoric monuments, Neolithic and Bronze Age dolmens, burial mounds, andIron Agecastros(hill forts). Galicia was also a major centre of prehistoric miningwith its tin and gold highly prized by theRoman conquerors, and continued to beso into the early modern period. Consequently the area accrued a reputation forancient buried treasures.89It was not ancient peoples, however, that came to beassociated with this landscape of treasure but the Moors who had been driven outof Galicia during the eighth centuryad. Numerous legends evolved of Moorishgold hidden in thecastros, many protected by spells and spirits that only theCiprianillocould break. In the early1930s the Galician writer VicenteRiscocollected various oral accounts of the successful conjurations of such Moorishtreasure involving theCiprianillo. One legend told how a man consulted hisCiprianillo, drew a Solomonic circle on the ground, and thereby hauled out allthe bad spirits, ‘souls in sorrow’, which guarded the treasure. All night long he andhis lucky assistants removed bars of gold and silver from the site. In anotherinstance a group read from theCiprianillofor two hours and then the groundbegan to shake, thunder shook the sky, and a series of devils emerged from a holein the ground dragging carts full of gold.90It would seem that from the seventeenth century onwards printed andmanuscriptgacetas(gazetteers) listing the locations of such buried treasures werepopular in parts of Spain.91In1739, for instance, a priest of Albacete confessedthat he had been guilty of treasure hunting after a soldier based in Granada had‘shown him a book in Arabic . . . which indicated several places and spots wherethe Moors had buried precious objects and treasures’.92Thegacetasseem to havebeen particularly inXuential in the old Moorish kingdom of Granada and inthe northwestern provinces. Writing in1750the Benedictine monk Benito116|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Jero ́nimo Feijoo (1676–1764), an arch-critic of popular ‘superstition’, noted fromhis own experience that treasure seeking for Moorish gold was rife in Galicia andAsturias. During his childhood in the region he heard stories of prized manu-scripts that revealed the location of treasures. Some believed that such tomes didnot exist and were merely the products of peasant tales, but Feijoo was persuadedof their reality when one of them was given to him in which directions wereprovided for locating twenty treasures hidden in the countryside around the cityof Oviedo.93People puzzled over where thesegacetascame from. Some believedthat such knowledge of Moorish treasure originated from those who had beenheld captive and ransomed by Barbary pirates in Algiers and Morocco—aproWtable line of trade right into the nineteenth century. Others thought suchsecret knowledge must have derived from documents in the famedRoyalArchive of Simancas.94The inXuence of thesegacetascertainly remained strong in Asturias and Galiciathroughout the nineteenth century, where old manuscript and printed versionscontinued to circulate. Around1850an enterprising Galician publisher produced acheap, poorly printed hoaxgacetaentitled theMillonario de San Ciprian, whichpurported to contain a list of the hiddenRoman and Moorish treasures secreted inthe neighbourhood of the city of Corun ̃a. It had the bogus imprint of ‘Amsterdam’,mimicking the ruse used by Spanish publishers wishing to avoid the censoriousattentions of the Inquisition, and the date1521. Its purported author was AdolfoOjarak. The surname spelt backwards is the rude Spanish exclamation ‘Carajo!’,and the author used the same technique to turn derogatory coarse phrases addressedto its readers into supposed secret words of power.95For Feijoo the worst thing about the ‘vain and pernicious’ preoccupation withgacetaswas that it seduced people into resorting to magic. This was brought hometo him by perusing a grimoire owned by the same person who gave him thegaceta.The man handed both over to Feijoo after becoming disillusioned with his lack ofsuccess and fearful over their sinful, ‘superstitious’ inXuence.96During the earlytwentieth century one Asturian folklorist recorded an account of a man from thehamlet of Vildas, who, frustrated in his attempt to dig up treasures mentioned in agaceta, resorted to theLibro de San Ciprianoto invoke a demon to aid him.97It is nosurprise, then, that in the late nineteenth century an enterprising publisher hitupon the idea of packaging agacetafor Galicia with theLibro de San Cipriano,thereby providing both the location of buried treasures and the magical means ofcapturing them. Some editions also published a list of treasures in Portugal,ensuring the spread of theCipriano’s inXuence on local traditions, particularly inthe Barroso region of northern Portugal, with its strong cultural and linguistic tieswith Galicia.98As we shall see in a later chapter, it was not long before it was alsobeing sold far and wide across Latin America.Enlightenment and Treasure|117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The land of FaustThe late eighteenth century saw the beginnings ofvolkskunde—the study of thelife and culture of the ‘people’ and the precursor of what we know today as‘folklore’. In Germany this interest grew out of theRomantic movement, andwhile it was not a speciWcally German phenomenon, the likes of the Grimmbrothers were hugely inXuential in inspiring others around Europe to explore thestories and beliefs of the poor and uneducated.99Conveniently forgetting that thejudiciary in some central European states had only recently rejected the crime ofwitchcraft, the interest in what were now seen as the mental relics of an unen-lightened medieval age took several forms. There were those learned men andwomen across Europe who considered it necessary to identify and understand‘vulgar’ beliefs and practices the better to stamp them out in the name of eitherGod or rationalism. Others were more compassionate, recognizing the aestheticand cultural worth in thema ̈rchenor tales of the peasantry, while acknowledgingthat such survivals would succumb to the necessary forces of progress.Grimoires, seen as the remnants of benighted medieval magic, did not con-venientlyWt into the romantic perception of folklore as oral culture. Yet theircontinued inXuence on popular beliefs rendered them of interest to those whoseenthusiasm forvolkskundewas matched by the natural curiosity of the biblio-phile.100The most well known of these was the celebrated writer Johann Wolf-gang von Goethe (1749–1832), best known for his verse drama of theFaustlegend. He certainly had an interest in Western esotericism, paid serious attentionto the spiritualism of Swedenborg, and was fascinated though sceptical of theoccult exploits of Cagliostro.101There is no evidence that Goethe ever dabbled inthe magical arts, though, and so his enthusiasm for collecting grimoires wasprobably born more of inquisitiveness and bibliomania than any practical interestin their contents. He expressed a book collector’s embarrassment over the moneyhe paid out for one grimoire that he had been tracking for a considerable time. Itwas a handsome manuscript dating to around the middle of the eighteenth centuryentitledBibliae Magicae, and is noteworthy for being the earliest known Germangrimoire professing to consist of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses. Goethe alsoowned a version of another distinctively German grimoire entitledFaust’sH€ollenzwang(Faust’s Infernal Command), which, like theGrand grimoire, concernedthe calling up of the Devil, and was much sought after by treasure seekers.DiVerent motives led the German philologist and librarian Johann ChristophAdelung (1732–1806) to include a copy of aFaust’s H€ollenzwangin hisHistory ofHuman Folly.102This was possibly theWrst printed version of the grimoire, thoughdisappointingly, as Adelung explained, it had to be stripped of the originalmanuscript’s magical signs and sigils in order to reduce the cost of publication.118|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"What remained were various prayers and adjurations for calling the angels andspirits, which were included at the end of a volume that extensively trashed thereputations of John Dee, Nostradamus, and Paracelsus. Adelung published it forthe same reasons thatReginald Scot published charms and conjurations—toexpose the folly of believing in them. Just as with Scot, it probably proved acounter-productive exercise in the long run. At the end of the eighteenth centuryby no means all bibliophiles were averse to the lure of the occult. A university-educated town councillor in Darmstadt called Karl Wunderlich (1769–1841) usedhis extensive collection for alchemical and magical purposes. Amongst the1,700volumes in his study were copies of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, theH€ollenzwang, and other books of conjuration attributed to Dr Faust.The attribution of many of the eighteenth-century grimoires to Faust isperfectly understandable considering the huge popularity of chapbook accountsof his life. The town most associated with him, Wittenberg, had also long had areputation as a centre of magic. When Fynnes Moryson visited the town in1591he noted that ‘they shew a house wherein Doctor Faustus a famous conjurerdwelt . . . and had a tree all blasted and burnt in the adjoining, where hee practisedhis Magick Art.’103Some early LutheranReformers expressed their chagrin thatthe popular association of Faust with the town overshadowed its place as the heartof Lutheranism. The town’s reputation continued into the nineteenth century.According to one legend recorded in the town of Chemnitz, Saxony, in the1840s, the originalSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswere kept at Wittenberg.104The Faust grimoires by no means completely dominated eighteenth-centuryliterary magic. As well as Moses, of course, there were other prominent authorssuch as aRenaissance mage named Dr Habermann and another namedRabbiRabellina. Both were bogus it would seem. The secretary of the DresdenRoyalLibrary, and later its chief, Friedrich Adolf Ebert, recalled that in1817he and hiscolleagues received numerous urgent requests for a work byRabellina calledDiegoldne TabellaRabellina, which was described by inquirers as containing an imageof a raven with a ring in its beak and various occult characters. The image of araven, it should be noted, was a common element in German grimoires, and onegenre of grimoire was entitledThe BlackRaven. Ebert’s curiosity was provokedand he searched in vain for a copy amongst the library’s books and manuscripts;neither could heWnd any clues to the identity ofRabellina. His interest waned butwas roused again when one of the inquirers subsequently wrote to say that he hadfound a copy owned by a Dresden resident and oVered to show it to Ebert. Ebertlater published a description of it for the beneWt of his ‘brother librarians, who mayhave been wearied with similar inquiries’. It was a printed edition, publishedsometime after1750, consisting of forty-eight badly written and poorly producedpages. It was entitledTrinum perfectum magiæ albæ et nigræ, and professed to consistEnlightenment and Treasure|119"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"of magical wisdom from theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses. It contained manycharacters and seals, which had been produced by hand rather than woodcut.Ebert considered it to be ‘from beginning to end the merest nonsense’.105TheTrinum perfectumprovided instructions on how to command spirits, andone suspects that some of those writing to the Dresden Library had treasure ontheir minds. It was, after all, this activity that fuelled the production of themanuscripts collected by the likes of Goethe and Wunderlich. Until the middleof the century treasure seeking remained a capital crime in some German Catholicstates, and a mandate against it was issued in the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg aslate as1776. Prosecutions occurred periodically throughout the century, andnumerous grimoires were conWscated in the process.106In1773, in the south-western town of Gu ̈nzburg, for instance, the ringleader of a group of treasureseekers was punished by having to kneel in the marketplace with his magicalmanuscripts.107Among them was the much sought after St Christopher Prayer forcompelling the spirits and demons that guarded treasure. In southern Germanyduring the mid-eighteenth century Protestant and Catholic theologians alikecondemned its use.108It consisted of a long-winded plea to the saint, which, insome versions, beseeched him to send a spirit in human form with99,000ducatsof currency. It was described by the English scholar of German magical literature,Eliza Butler, as ‘an interminable, hysterical and maddeningly repetitive series ofprayers and conjurations which could I think only have emanated from a Germanbrain’.109(Needless to say, Butler, a Cambridge professor of German, had a deeplyprejudiced view of German culture. A few years after the Second World War shewrote several books on the history of magic, which were underpinned by herbelief that in Germany’s literary and magical traditions she could identify traces ofthe psyche that bred Nazism.)By the end of the eighteenth century treasure hunting was creating a consid-erable market for German grimoires not only in the German states but also inAustria and parts of neighbouring Switzerland. In a series of trials in the Vorarlberg,the westernmost Alpine state in Austria, weWnd would-be treasure seekers goingto considerable eVort and expense toWnd copies.110Amongst the most prizedin this part of the Catholic Alps were grimoires attributed to the Jesuits, such asone handed over to the Austrian Church authorities in1823entitledDer wahrhafteJesuiten allerh€ochste H€ollenzwang(The Truthful Jesuit’s Very Highest InfernalCommand).111The Jesuits were expelled from Austria in1773following a papaldecree, and it is likely that the concept of the Jesuit grimoire, containing thehidden knowledge of a forbidden society, developed there afterwards. Anotherdistinctive grimoire tradition in this part of the Alps concerned a magical prayerbook said to have been written by the thirteenth-century mystic and prophetessSt Gertrude of Helfta. The prayers in theGertrudenbu ̈chlein, like those of St Cyprian120|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"and St Christopher elsewhere, were thought to be hugely useful in dealing withthe spirits and devils that guarded treasure. Pious Gertrude prayer books had beencirculating in the German language during the seventeenth century, but it wasprobably only in the following century that her association with treasure huntingdeveloped in Alpine folklore.112The extent to which grimoires circulated in popular as well as learned culture isindicated by the case of the itinerant glass-painter JosephReuther. During the1770s he was hired to seek out magic manuscripts on his travels through the townsand villages of Bavaria. AsReuther could not read Latin, the language in whichparts of some of the grimoires were written, he went into partnership with aweaver named ChristopherReger, of Lauingen, who could.Reger made Germantranslations to sell on, though he admitted that he could not understand every-thing he read in the manuscripts gathered byReuther and so omitted such passagesin the copies he made.113One of their treasure-seeking acquaintances, a tailor,owned a magical manuscript in Latin that he passed on to his landlady, who thenapplied toReger.Around1775someone, somewhere, printed a32-page German work entitledD. Fausts Original Geister Commando, apparently written by Dr Habermann, anddatedRome1510. Professing to be based on a Solomonic tract, theSixth andSeventh Books of Moses, and TabellaRabellina, it contained a depiction of a ravenperched on a book, magical sigils, and lists of the secret holy names of God and thespirits, including Mephistopheles. This very rare book, now in the British Library,was poorly printed, suggesting it might have been an early attempt at reaching apopular market. It was evidently one of several printed versions judging fromEbert’s account of the similarRabellinaTrinum perfectum. Othervolksbuchercon-taining magical receipts, though not spirit conjurations, proved far more successfularound the time. One was a chapbook entitledDie Egyptische Geheimnisse(Egyptian Secrets), which was attributed to Albertus Magnus. It contained whatwere purported to be gypsy (i.e. Egyptian) charms like those contained in Frenchgrimoires and theMe ́decin des pauvres, for a range of human and livestock ailments,as well as other simple household spells to protect against thieves, evil spirits, andwicked people. Even more popular was a similar compilation of ‘gypsy’ magiccalled theRomanusbu ̈chlein, theWrst known edition of which appeared in Silesia in1788, though Venice was given as the place of publication.114The inXuence of theBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires beyond the French border hasalready been noted. As national boundaries changed during the upheaval of theNapoleonic wars, so concerns over the circulation of illicit French publicationsXuctuated. The Prussian authorities in theRhineland territories annexed in1815,for instance, were very wary of French political and religious inXuence, andconsequently kept a close eye on theXow of books. When, in1834, a peddlerEnlightenment and Treasure|121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"from near Trier applied for a passport to go to Lyon, oYcials expressed concernthat he might bring back pernicious publications.115They may not have beenthinking of grimoires but Lyon certainly had a reputation in German states as acentre of occult publishing second only toRome. This was in part due to thelegendary Beringos Fratres. Some of the German Faust grimoires circulating in theeighteenth century stated they were copied from works published in Lyon, such asone held in Dresden Library entitledD. Johannis Fausti Magia celeberrima, dated1511, and another entitledDoct. Joh. Fausten’s Miracul, Kunst und Wunderbuch.116At the time, the Prussian authorities also had a burgeoning German market topolice. In1824an edition ofAlbertus Magnus’s Egyptian Secretswas conWscatedfrom one trader.117By1850a fourth German edition of theDragon rougehadapparently been published in Ilmenau in the centre of Germany.118Ironically, thebiggest boost to the democratization of German grimoires did not come fromabroad or from illicit publishers, though, but from scholarly exercises in historicalinquiry.Between1821and1826the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1769–1832) produced a six-volume compilation of magical works printed by the Mainzpublisher Florian Kupferberg. Considering the long history of Protestant clericalcondemnation of grimoires, it is somewhat surprising that a pastor would beresponsible for theWrst major grimoire publishing exercise since the seventeenthcentury. Horst certainly had an abiding interest in the history of witchcraft andmagic, and in1818had written a widely read encyclopaedic history of the subject,Fig.8D. Faust’s original geister commando(c.1775)—frontispiece and title page.122|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Daemonomagie oder Geschichte des Glaubens und Zauberei. Horst, who unlike some ofhis brethren, looked detachedly upon witchcraft as a historical phenomenon, wasone of theWrst witchcraft historians to delve into the archives and it was presum-ably his research in this area that led him to seek out ‘medieval’ magic manuals thatrepresented the mindset of the age. But the most far-reaching inXuence on thespread of German grimoires was the publishing venture of the Stuttgart antiquar-ian bookseller Johann Scheible. Very little is known about him despite consider-able archival research.119He seems to have set up hisWrst publishing house in1831and over the next few years it went through various partnerships. There is nothingto suggest he had any occult interests. A catalogue of1836contains no magicworks. So it remains a complete mystery as to why, between1845and1849,heincluded some forty grimoires in a twelve-volume collection of old ‘miraculousand curious’ German literature,Das Kloster.120Unlike theBibliothe`que bleue,DasKlosterwas a purely antiquarian exercise and certainly not aVordable for orproduced for a popular readership. Scheible went to considerable eVort to gathermanuscripts from libraries and private owners of varying social levels and occultinterests. Amongst those manuscripts he included were a copy of the St Christo-pher Prayer, several grimoires attributed to Habermann, Faust, and Solomon, andDas Buch JeziraandTrinum MagiaebyRabellina. Of all the magic books thatScheible put into print for theWrst time, the most inXuential was theSixth andSeventh Books of Moses. Some German scholars have pointed to an advert thatappeared in the literary periodicalAllgemeiner Litterarischer Anzeigerin1797oVer-ing magic books for sale, including theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, as proof ofa late-eighteenth-centuryWrst edition. It would seem, however, that Scheible wastheWrst to print a full version.121This may seem a pedantic point, but it is asigniWcant detail considering that Scheible’s edition would be copied by othersand go on to have a global cultural impact comparable to thePetit Albert.Black books in the NorthThere is no doubting the eVect that German manuscript grimoires had on themagical tradition of its northern neighbours. The inXuence was strongest in Den-mark where weWnd references to the ‘Faustbog’andthe‘Romolus-bog’, the latterpresumably a version of theRomanusbu ̈chlein.122Legends circulated in Sweden andNorway regarding those who possessed theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses.123In1802the Danish authorities arrested an itinerant cunning-man and treasure hunternamed Jens Clemmensen and conWscated a magic book in German bearing the title‘Julius Ciprianus den XII & D.J. Faustus Dreyfaices H€ollen Schwang’. The booksurvives today in the DanishRoyal Library.124Considering the close trading linksEnlightenment and Treasure|123"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"between the Baltic neighbours it is no surprise that German grimoires circulatedfreely enough in Scandinavia. Military relationships also provided another conduit.Both the Danish and Swedish monarchs relied heavily on German mercenariesduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Indeed, Germans trained theDanish Norwegian army during the eighteenth century, and German was thelanguage of military command there until the1770s. As we shall see, though,svartebokenorsvartkonstboken, ‘black books’ or ‘black work books’, as grimoires areknown in Danish and Swedish, accrued their own distinctive traditions and content.It has been estimated that over a hundred black books survive in Norwegianlibraries and museums alone, most dating to the late eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies.125ThisWgure is by no means representative of the number that musthave been produced, and so for Scandinavia as a whole it is not unlikely thatseveral thousand manuscripts circulated during the period. In the1820s one poorDanish cottager, an autodidact, made a living transcribing and selling upwards of ahundred copies of one manuscript black book in his possession.126Despite sharingthe same name the content of the Scandinavian black books are surprisinglydiverse, a consequence perhaps of the limited print tradition during the eighteenthcentury. Some were simple charm books and herbals rather than grimoires,providing practical medical advice, some of it illicit. Several Norwegian blackbooks, for instance, contained herbal recipes to procure abortions using savin, anon-native juniper.127Most included spells for the usual desires. Treasure huntingwas, of course, as popular as elsewhere in Europe.128Some black books alsoprovided instructions on how to make a pact with the Devil, such as the followingfrom an example dating to around1790–1820:When you want to release the angels from Hell, you should in themorning when you rise say this:I renounce you, God the Father that has made me. I renounce you, theHoly Spirit that has blessed me. I will never worship or serve you after thisday, and I completely swear to Lucifer, ruler of the dark abyss. And Iswear to his rule, and he shall serve me and do what I ask of him. Inexchange I will give you my own blood as insurance and a pledge. Thisinsures me to him with body and soul for all eternity, if he does what Iask, order, or command of him. And thereupon I sign my own hand andwith my own blood. This to be certain and true in every possible way.’129The inXuence of such literature on young men was of particular concern toDanish and Swedish authorities during the eighteenth century. A series of trialswere held in Denmark in the1720s involving soldiers who had made such writtenpacts with the Devil. Several of the men were publicly executed as a warning ofthe heinousness of this ultimate act of blasphemy. Over the next decade or so124|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Fig.9Title page from a late eighteenth-century LatinCyprianusentitled the ‘key of hell orwhite and black magic’."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Danish theologians and jurists spilt much ink debating the religious and legalposition of pact making. Likewise in Sweden at least twenty-nine people weretried for the same crime between1680and1789.130In Denmark and Norway, the latter remaining a Danish territory during theeighteenth century, many black books were attributed to the authorship ofSt Cyprian, though by the nineteenth century there was confusion about hisidentity. In Holsten, Denmark, Cyprianus was believed to be an evil Dane kickedout of Hell, while a Norwegian black book described him as a ‘tender and decent’student.131Why the Lutheran Danes adopted him as their grimoire authorsupreme is less obvious than his hold in Catholic Spain, where churches as wellas prayers were dedicated to the real rather than legendary saint. Germany was themost likely inXuence. WeWnd a grimoire entitled ‘Cyprianus H€ollenzwa ̈nge’circulating in Germany at the time, and Scheible printed a text entitled ‘Cyprian’sInvocation of Angels, with his Conjuration for the Spirits guarding HiddenTreasures’.132Jens Clemmensen’s treasure-conjuring manual was probably aversion of this manuscript. Whatever the path of inXuence, the pre-eminence ofthe title in Danish magical tradition was certainly sealed by the publication in the1770s of theWrst printed Scandinavian black book—more of which a little later.Because there was no chapbook grimoire revolution in Scandinavia, ownershipduring the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was restricted largely to theeducated middling sort, namely civil servants, teachers, clergy, and soldiers. Thelatter had a particularly strong inXuence on the circulation of grimoires inScandinavian society. One black book owner was a Norwegian military oYcerand farmer named Ulrich Christian Heide (d.1785).133He was in many ways atypical ‘enlightenment’ man. He spoke several languages and donated some457ofhis books in English, French, and Danish, including the writings of Voltaire, to amilitary school. Hissvartebokwas not among them. Was his interest in his blackbooks that of the detached antiquarian? Or did it contain occult secrets in whichHeide had an earnestly professional interest? One can understand why aWnelyproduced Cyprianus of Danish origin, written around the same time as Heide’sblack book, was owned by a succession of Norwegian oYcers during the earlynineteenth century.134It contained magic to improve one’s shot and to curryfavour with superiors.As has already been mentioned, the other great attraction of black books forsoldiers was the information some of them contained regarding the Devil’s pact.Soldiers made up nearly a half of those prosecuted in eighteenth-century Swedenfor attempting to make a pact with Satan. As well as money they understandablyasked for protection from bullets and a guaranteed lifespan. Military interest wasfurther enhanced by the legendary diabolic activities of the French general theDuke of Luxembourg, who, as we have seen, was caught up in the AVair of the126|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Fig.10Prophetesses and Cyprianus’ Big Dream Book. A nineteenth-century Danish divinationmanual."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Poisons. The magician Lesage claimed Luxembourg had requested his magical aidin military matters amongst other things, while Marie Bosse stated, under torture,that Luxembourg desired to call up the Devil. Luxembourg was known to have aweakness for fortune-tellers and admitted under interrogation to having consultedLesage on a couple of occasions. He said that Lesage had oVered to sell him a copyof theEnchiridion Leonis papæ, but he declined.135There was no mention in thepolice archives that he had ever attempted a Devil’s pact.Rumours of his occult dabblings were quickly used for propagandist purposes,and in1680theWrst of numerous editions of a German chapbook appeared, whichgave an account of how the duke had sold himself to the Devil while in the Bastillein1659.136The myth was further promoted in a couple of English publicationsfollowing his successes against the English King William in Flanders during theearly1690s. In one an English soldier reXects, ‘the Devil and Luxemburg didbewitch us: And that damn’d Magician may brag of this, as one of his bravestFeats.’137More to the point, Danish editions of the German Luxembourgchapbook also appeared during the second half of the eighteenth century.138There is no doubt that the story was inXuential in Scandinavia. An account ofLuxembourg’s pact, presumably a German edition, was found amongst the pos-sessions of a Swedish diabolist in1776. His name also found its way into severalNorwegian black books. A treasure-digging spell from around1800mentions‘Doctor Factus’ (Faustus) and ‘Luxenborg’ as the Devil’s servants, and a blackbook Devil’s contract from around1780refers to ‘Lukemborgs’.139Scandinavian manuscript grimoires were commonly given a foreign origin. Wehave seen this was standard practice elsewhere, but in Scandinavia little referencewas made to such legendary centres of grimoire production asRome, Salamanca,Toledo, and Lyon. The owner of onesvartebok, a Norwegian schoolteachernamed Arne Larsen, wrote in it that he had purchased it in Amsterdam on the15September1816and paid three Dutch stivers for it, the equivalent of a fewpence at the time. Another example stated that it had been written by one BishopJohannes Sell ‘from Oxfordjin Englandjyear1682’. This is undoubtedly theBishop of Oxford John Fell (1625–86), who in1681had published a translation ofSt Cyprian’sOf the Unity of the Church.140It is obvious, then, why Fell was pickedon to be a black book author, but he was nevertheless an unusual choice. A coupleof manuscript versions of a Danish Cyprianus claimed to be copied fromone supposedly printed in Stavanger, Norway, in1699. For Danes, Norway,like Finland, had a reputation as a land of magicians due to legends surroundingthe Saami of the northern territories.141By far the most widespread belief was that the black books came fromWittenberg, where folklore had it that the Scandinavian clergy trained in a schoolfor the black arts. Only once they had been awarded their black books could128|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ministers return to their parishes and command and exorcize the Devil. Accordingto a Norwegian legend, though, some ministers left Wittenberg empty-handed, asthere were more students than available black books.142Numerous black booksadhered to this Wittenberg derivation, such as one manuscript entitled ‘Cypria-niugs Kunstboeg’, which explained that it was found in the ‘Vittenbergs Accade-mie in1722’. In another weWnd an inscription that it was ‘a copy of the actualBlack book, written at the university of Wittenberg year1529and thereafterfound at Copenhagen Castle in the year1591’. In both cases, and in others, wealsoWnd the motif that the manuscript was found in a marble chest.143ThisWittenberg tradition was obviously inXuenced in part by the Faust legend. Peoplein Scandinavia certainly tried to emulate him. A Devil’s pact written by ashoemaker of Odense, Denmark, in1634began, ‘I give myself to Satan to behis own with body and soul. Just as Dr. Faustus became Satan’s own, may I do thesame.’ A Danish soldier named Johan Pistorius, prosecuted in1718, said he wasinspired to make a pact with the Devil after reading a book on Doctor Faustus.144But in Lutheran Scandinavia the notion of ministers training at a School of BlackArts in Wittenberg suggests a blending in popular tradition of the town’s dualreputation as both the home of Faust and the home of Martin Luther and theReformation. Indeed, a Danish Church Ordinance of1627requiring allprospective Lutheran ministers to obtain a university degree meant that someNorwegian clergymen did attend the University of Wittenberg, as well as thatin Copenhagen and the north German town ofRostock.145The advent of print grimoires did little to undermine the Wittenberg tradition.TheWrst one printed in Scandinavia,Sybrianus P.P.P., was produced in Denmarkin1771, around the same time as they were starting to be published in Germany. Itwas penned by an impoverished writer named S€orenRosenlund, who, under thenom de plume ‘Junior Philopatreias’ had written works on a variety of mundanetopics. We can assume thatRosenlund’s decision to publish theSybrianuswasmotivated purely by money rather than an Enlightenment exercise in highlightingthe folly of grimoires. The content was made up of a mix of his own inventionsalong with recipes and conjurations culled from manuscripts. It is likely thathe made use of those housed in the DanishRoyal Library, and it is presumablyfrom these that he borrowed the various runic symbols that made theSybrianusP.P.P. distinctive. There is no doubting the signiWcant impact theSybrianusP.P.P. had on the Danish manuscript tradition. Numerous handwritten blackbooks from the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries share the same title, thevarious runic formulae it contained, and the distinctive and curious descendingkalemaris charm, which worked in the same way as abracadabra, was commonlyemployed:146Enlightenment and Treasure|129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Fig.11Page from the Danish cunning-man Anders Ulfkjær’sCyprianus."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"KALEMARISKALEMARIKALEMARKALEMAKALEMKALEKALKAKAround1890another enterprising Dane named Henrik Kokborg, an apoth-ecary, photographer, and small-time book publisher on the Danish mainlandproduced a cheap grimoire under the titleEn lille Udtog af Syprianus(A LittlePiece of Syprianus).147As the use of the ‘S’ in Syprianus suggests, some of itscontents shared similarities withRosenlund’s production, but otherwise muchof it was probably garnered from several manuscript black books that Kokborg wasknown to have possessed. Kokborg had a reputation for practising magic andvarious legends tell how he bewitched people and called up the Devil. Hecertainly knew that there was money to be made from such beliefs. As well as aCelestial Letter, he published a couple of broadside charms to help the bewitched,and hisSyprianuscontained more spells against witchcraft thanRosenlund’s andother manuscript black books.148It was only during the second half of the nineteenth century that similar cheapgrimoires were printed in Sweden. One of theWrst, published in Stockholm in1877, was entitledSvartkonstboken, and had a stylized image of the Devil on thefront. It cost25€ore, the price of a few postage stamps at the time. It began with anaccount entitled ‘How I got the Black Art Book’, which ignores the black booklegends mentioned earlier. The narrator tells a story of how he became acquaintedwith a strange old man with gypsy blood in his veins. He was a ‘trollkarlen’—a‘witch-man’ or cunning-man who said he gained some of his powers from hisblack book. He said that when heWrst read it sparks emanated from it, he was sickfor days afterwards and subsequently began to behave strangely. One dark and foulnight the narrator visited the strange man in his hut in the woods, hoping to get aglimpse of his mysterious book. The cunning-man led him into a small room,lifted up a log, and in a hole beneath lifted out an old, yellowing book, which hegave to the narrator. It contained passages in Latin and so the narrator concludedthat the monks must have had some hand in its content. The narrator in present-ing its magical contents to the reader said he reproduced it for the sake of curiosityrather than as a valuable manual of magical aid.Enlightenment and Treasure|131"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The importance of print is a surprising recurring motif in the Scandinavianblack book tradition. The act of transcription and the rituals associated with thecreation of magic manuscripts, the use of parchment and consecrated inks forexample, meant that, in general, print was seen as inherently less magical. It wouldseem that in Scandinavia, though, print was a seal of authority and occultlegitimacy. We see this in the statements in several Cyprianus grimoires thatthey were copies of one printed in Stavanger in1699, and the claim in the‘Cyprianiugs Kunstboeg’ that it derived from a copy found in1722and subse-quently printed. A Danish cunning-man prosecuted during the mid-nineteenthcentury made the point of telling the court that he had obtained his knowledgefrom a ‘Sympathie Book’ ‘published by Cyprianus and printed in red letters’.149In Finland, which had long been a Swedish territory until it was incorporated intotheRussian empire during the early nineteenth century, the tradition of ‘BlackBibles’ used bytieta ̈ja ̈s(cunning-folk) was evidently shaped by Swedish printculture. As recorded in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Finnishfolklore, the Black Bibles were thought to consist of white or red print on blackpages. One Finnish folklorist, commenting on the reputation of atieta ̈ja ̈snamedOld Aapa who was known to possess a Black Bible, noted that some ‘claimed thatwhile Aapa certainly had some kind of book, it was just an old Swedish medicalhandbook’.150The Black Bible with its red print on black pages had clear diabolicassociations, which were in turn coloured by resentment regarding Swedishcultural inXuence. A similar demonizing of ruling elites has been identiWed inEstonian folklore regarding German landlords.151English reserve?As elsewhere, there was a ready market for grimoires in Britain. Eighteenth- andearly-nineteenth-century cunning-folk treasured copies ofReginald Scot’sDis-coverieandRobert Turner’s edition of Agrippa’sFourth Book of Occult Philosophy.Manuscript versions and extracts circulated in popular culture, and evidence oftheir use can be found in the counter-witchcraft charms sold by Welsh andEnglish cunning-folk.152The birth of new evangelical, mystical, and propheticmovements, such as the Swedenborgians, also sustained a favourable environmentfor the continued interest in Neoplatonic magic in certain social circles, mostlyamong inquisitive young men from artisan or middling-sort backgrounds. Yet achapbook grimoire revolution never happened. This is remarkable consideringthat, in the period, English and Scottish publishers produced huge numbers ofchapbooks on astrology and divination. Apart from love spells there was very littlepractical magic in these chapbooks, and none of the healing charms and spirit132|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Fig.12A magician at work.

It borrowed heavily from Scot’sDiscoverieand also included extractsfrom an edition of the secrets of Albertus Magnus. There is no evidence to suggestthat it disseminated widely enough to have made an impact on popular tradition.England’s contribution to the diVusion of ritual magic and conjuration laynot in the chapbook genre, but in the production of several expensive, heftycompilations of early modern Neoplatonic wisdom. TheWrst oVthe presses wasthe work of one of the most inXuential occultists in modern British history—theastrologer and Freemason Ebenezer Sibly (1751–c.1799). Sibly, the son of amechanic, had practised as an astrologer in Bristol, and by the time he moved toLondon around1788he had already written his huge four-part work of occultphilosophy,A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology. Siblywas no spirit conjurer, though, and condemned such attempts as wicked blackmagic. The blessed angelic host, who were so crucial to the working of celestialinXuence on Earth, were not at the beck and call of mere mortals. Nevertheless,the numerous editions of theComplete Illustrationprovided a treasure house ofinformation on magical procedure, including a description of the infernal spiritsand their powers taken from the1665edition of Scot’sDiscoverie.155The sign-iWcance of this will be revealed in the next chapter. TheComplete Illustrationalsoexcited others to explore beyond the boundaries of magic acceptable to Sibly,including provincial cunning-folk who evidently treasured the book.156Sibly moved to London at a time when, as the historian E. P. Thompson put it,the capital was experiencing an ‘explosion of anti-rationalism’.157There was aheady mix of political radicalism inspired by the FrenchRevolution, spiritualinterest provoked by the angelic communications and mystical writings ofEmanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), a surge in millenarian prophecy, and magicalexperimentation. A short-lived periodical entitled theConjuror’s Magazine, or,Magical and Physiognomical Mirror, was produced in London between1792and1793. The capital’s big booksellers, such as James Lackington, acted as importantrepositories of magic. Lackington’s ‘Temple of the Muses’ in Finsbury Square wasa London wonder. Above the entrance were the words ‘Cheapest Bookseller inthe World’.158The shop of the occult book dealer John Denley contained one ofthe best collections of magic books and manuscripts in the country. Beforebecoming a Swedenborgian preacher, Ebenezer Sibly’s brother, Manoah, had134|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"also been a more modest London dealer in occult works. Thanks to theCompleteIllustration of the Celestial ScienceEbenezer also became a magnet for others wishingto learn more of the occult sciences. One such disciple who removed to Londonto consult from the master was a Lincolnshire cunning-man and self-publicistnamed John Parkins.159During his sojourn in the capital, and shortly after Sibly’s death, Parkins also saidhe received instruction from another self-proclaimed adept of the occult sciencesnamed Francis Barrett.160Barrett, described in one newspaper report as ‘a mini-ature-painter, and an amateur of chemistry’, was better known in his lifetime for hisfailed ballooning exploits than his knowledge of magic.161Three times in the year1802he drummed up a large paying crowd to see him attempt a balloon assent, andthree times he failed embarrassingly.Regarding his attempt at Greenwich, onereporter complained, ‘at no public exhibition do we ever recollect such a completewant of management as at Mr. Barrett’s Balloon,’ while at Swansea the platformcollapsed as he began to address the crowd, damaging his balloon, and causing injuryto a number of spectators. He departed to the sound of hootings and howlings fromthe crowd.Reporting on this thirdWascoThe Morning Chroniclestated, ‘we hope itwill be the last. In short, he does not seem to posses a suYcient knowledge ofchemistry.’162Decades later, long after his ballooning disasters had faded frompopular memory, he achieved a degree of notoriety as the author of theWrst majorEnglish discourse on spirit conjuration since the seventeenth century.The Magus: orCelestial Intelligencer, published by Lackington in1801, ventured where Sibly refusedto go. It was, however, still little more than a compilation of material quite skilfullyculled from a range of books borrowed from John Denley. It relied heavily on theseventeenth-century English editions of Agrippa’sThree Books of Occult Philosophy,theFourth Book of Occult Philosophy, and theHeptameron.163Barrett considered hiswork a contribution to the magical renaissance in the country: ‘At this time,’ he said,‘the abstruse sciences of Nature begin to be more investigated than for a century past,during which space they have been almost totally neglected.’164At the time of its publication it proved no more successful than his ballooningactivities. Its distinctive, original colour plates of the heads of several principalspirits rendered it expensive to produce. A review inThe CriticalReviewbegan, ‘Invain do we boast of the progress of philosophy;—for, behold! In the beginning ofthe nineteenth century appears a work which ought not to have surpassed theWfteenth.’ It went on to comment, ‘It would be loss of time to criticise withgravity so weak and ignorant a book.’165A couple of decades later it was fetchinghigh prices in the antiquarian book trade, and its impact on the country’s popularmagic was very limited compared to Sibly’s opus. A rare example of its use wasrecorded in1857in a report on a visit to a Liverpool fortune-teller. The inves-tigating journalist noted that in the diviner’s study there was a large oval crystalEnlightenment and Treasure|135"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"lying on a copy ofThe Magus, a book which the fortune-teller ‘professed to valuehighly’. It seemed to serve, however, more as a prop than a well-thumbed springof magical knowledge.166In the long term, though,The Maguswould become amajor inXuence on the middle-class occult revival of the late nineteenth andtwentieth centuries.Fig.13Manuscript title page of Francis Barrett’sThe Magus(1801).136|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"What of his pupil John Parkins? If anyone was to write a populist grimoire atthe time he was the most likely candidate. He was a sophisticated exploiter ofprint, producing puVs advertising his magical powers, talismans, and handwrittencopies of his own grimoire,The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of DivineMagic.167Such was the reputation he generated through his herbal and fortune-telling publications, and his advertisements in the regional press, that his death waseven recorded in the respected periodicalThe Gentleman’s Magazine.In1830itnoted the demise, at the age ofWfty-nine, of ‘Mr. Parkins, commonly called‘‘Dr. Parkins,’’ a celebrated astrologer and fortune teller’.168Yet he never movedinto the chapbook grimoire market, even though he worked with chapbookpublishers. HisUniversal Fortune-Teller(1810), for example, was produced by theLondon bookseller and publisher Thomas Tegg, one-time owner of the EccentricBook Warehouse in West SmithWeld. Tegg produced an eclectic mix of high-minded improving literature, gothic tales, and chapbook adventures. He alsoproduced a range of guides on stage magic and legerdemain.169Would Tegghave added a popular grimoire to his stock if Parkins had presented one to him?Probably not. British chapbook publishers evidently practised a degree of self-censorship, particularly during the period ofRevolutionary and NapoleonicFrance, during which the British government kept a close eye on the printers.Fortune-telling and a bit of love magic were all that was considered acceptable.Any magical content darker than that was out of bounds, even if it was prefacedwith disingenuous provisos that such information was published as an illustrationof the superstitions of the past. An equation can be drawn with pornography. Aswith grimoires this was a forte of illicit French publishing, but it was keptrelatively suppressed by both the authorities and political self-censorship amongstBritishRadical populist publishers.170WithThe Magusbeing too expensive and diYcult to obtain, and with Parkinsdeclining to go into the print grimoire business, the only other aVordable sourceof instruction on spirit invocation and talismans was to be found in the works ofRobert Cross Smith (1795–1832). He was another Bristolian astrologer who madehis way to London, and soon found himself at the heart of a mutually supportivegroup of astrologers and occultists during the1820s. HisWrst foray into occultpublishing wasThe Philosophical Merlinpublished by John Denley in1822.Itpurported to be a translation of a magical manuscript owned by Napoleon, butwas in fact a mish-mash of material culled from Barrett’sThe Magus. It was aXopand most of the stock was remaindered.171Smith then took over the editorship ofa weekly periodical calledThe Straggling Astrologer, which contained a diverseselection of articles, excerpts, and advice on astrology and magic. It folded afteronly twenty-two issues, but in1825it was repackaged as a book entitledTheAstrologer of the Nineteenth Century, claiming bogusly to be in its seventh edition. ItEnlightenment and Treasure|137"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"contained numerous talismans and spirit invocations, including incantations forraising the spirit of a suicide. For this it was advised that:the exorcist, being prepared with the pentacles of Solomon, the two sealsof the earth, and other necessaries, he must bind upon the top of hiswand, a bundle of St. John’s wort (milies perforatum), with the head of anowl; and, having repaired to the spot where the corpse of the self-murderer lies, at the solemn hour of midnight, precisely at twelveo-clock, he must draw the circle, and having entered it, solemnly repeatthe following words172Smith claimed some of these conjurations and talismans were culled from ancientmanuscripts in the possession of the Mercurii, a secret magic society of which hewas a member—perhaps the only one. However, one was also attributed toGeorge Graham, a friend of Smith’s, who was a disaster-prone occult balloonistin the Barrett mould. Most of the extra material not culled from Sibly or Barrettprobably derived from Denley’s collection.The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Centuryunfortunately suVered a similar fate asThe Philosophical Merlin. Its publisher,Walter Charleton Wright, went temporarily bankrupt, as did the next owner.No further editions appeared.173Smith’s occult publishing career certainlyseemed ill-starred until heWnally made money by entering the almanac marketunder the nom de plumeRaphael.Caution on behalf of the chapbook publishers and over-ambition on the part ofoccultists seems to have ensured that there was no grimoire revolution in Britain,and consequently British print culture had a limited inXuence on the magicaltraditions of its colonies around the world. Only Sibly had some impact in Indiawhere there was a venerable and inXuential astrological culture receptive to hisEnglish language opus.174Apart from an intriguing early nineteenth-centuryAmerican interlude, Britain’s international inXuence would only emerge in thesecond half of the century when a new breed of middle-class ritual magiciansbegan to form occult organizations and launch the next big exercise in magicalpublishing.138|Enlightenment and Treasure"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"CHAPTERFOURACROSS THEOCEANSWe saw in an earlier chapter how grimoires soon found their way to theAmericas amongst the possessions of the early colonists. The flow was amere trickle though, and their cultural influence very limited. With the expansionof Atlantic trade during the eighteenth century, and the increasing number ofemigrants crossing the ocean, the influence of grimoires overseas was bound toincrease, but not everywhere and not with the same impact. The power of theInquisition largely prevented the substantial infiltration of European grimoiresinto the Spanish colonies until the twentieth century, whereas theBibliothe`quebleueled to French grimoires having a huge influence on the diverse medical andmagical traditions generated in the Caribbean. Let us turn first, though, to howthe grimoire slowly but surely inveigled its way into the heart of the cultural andspiritual world of North America’s British and German settlers, inspiring newbeliefs and uniquely American controversies.By the late seventeenth century there is evidence that American cunning-folkwere using works of occult philosophy and practical magic, as well as Englishbooks on palmistry and astrology.1In1695RobertRoman of Chester County,Pennsylvania, was prosecuted and fined £5and costs for practising ‘geomancyaccording to Hidon and divining by a stick’. ‘Hidon’ is obviously a misspelling ofHeydon, for we find this author’s geomantic textThe Temple of Wisdomamongstthe three books confiscated fromRoman.

We have already heard of the impressive library of JohnWinthrop Jr. That of Edmund Berkeley, a member of the Virginia Council,contained a copy ofRichard Saunders’ palmistry manual,Physiognomy and Chiro-mancy(London,1653). This was the same sort of book—maybe the very book—that landed Dorcas Hoar in so much trouble during the Salem trials.3TheGovernor of New England, William Burnet, who died in1728, owned a copyof Turner’s1665edition ofThe Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy.4The British by no means held a monopoly on Colonial American occultliterature during the early eighteenth century. The various German Protestantmystical colonies in Pennsylvania were also foci for the accumulation of esotericand magic books. Millenarian Pietists, Mennonites, and Moravian groups fromthe Low Countries, Germany, and Switzerland were drawn to the English colonythanks to the religious tolerance instituted by the state’s Quaker founder WilliamPenn. But religious peace and harmony had their limits, and once settled inPennsylvania schisms amongst pious Protestant immigrants led to further spin-off sects following variant doctrines and new self-proclaimed prophets. While theinfluence of Kabbalah andRosicrucianism were evident in the teachings andpractices of a number of these religious communities, one group of Germancolonists in particular was renowned for its occult interests.5Germantown, founded in1683, was a modestly thriving Pennsylvanian settle-ment by the time the followers of Johann Zimmerman, a Pietist mathematician,astronomer, and adherent of the mystic Jakob Boehme, arrived there. Zimmerman,who at one time taught at the University of Heidelberg, believed that the apoca-lypse and second coming of Christ would occur in1694. He believed the wildernessof America an appropriately biblical location to await Armageddon and the newmillennium: he died shortly before setting sail fromRotterdam. His followers, abrotherhood of learned Pietist men who had vowed to practise celibacy, choseJohannes Kelpius, a young Transylvanian theologian to lead them. The grouparrived in1694and settled in huts along the Wissahickon Creek near Germantownawaiting the new millennium. As soon as it became clear that Christ was not goingto return as predicted the thought of celibacy proved too much for some. After thedeath of Kelpius in1708most remaining members drifted away. In the meantime,those followers of Zimmerman who remained true to their initial guidingprinciples, and were inspired by their mystical philosophy and intellectual curiosity,immersed themselves in the occult possibilities of alchemy, Kabbalah, and astrologyduring their hermit existence.One of those original members who stayed on and continued his hermit’sexistence was Johann Gottfried Sehlee (Seelig) (d.1745), who apparently drew up140|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"horoscopes when requested, and who in his will bequeathed to a friend, ‘1scale,with gold and silver weights’, which indicate alchemical activity, along with ‘5bibles,14books,10of Jacob Boehmen’s books, and120Latin, Dutch and Greekbooks’.6His name would later become confused with that of a German publisheron Judaism Gottfried Selig (1722–95), who produced a German language versionof the Jewish mystical textSefer Shimush Tehilimconcerning the magical powers ofthe Psalms. In the early twentieth century this would reappear in a popular formatas Godfrey Selig’sThe Secrets of the Psalms.Christopher Witt, an English physician, clockmaker, botanist, and occultist, wasanother well-known figure who joined Kelpius in1704and remained in German-town to the end of his life. A letter recounting a visit to Witt written in1743described his study as ‘furnished with books containing different kinds of learning;as Philosophy, Natural Magic, Divinity, nay, even Mystical Divinity’. He lent outsome of his books and evidently tried to enthuse others in magic. One botanicalacquaintance wrote, ‘when we are on the topic of astrology, magic and mysticaldivinity, I am apt to be a little troublesome by inquiring into the foundation andreasonableness of these notions.’7One of Witt’s friends, Christopher Lehman, whohad arrived in Germantown from Germany in1730–1, shared not only Witt’sbotanical interests but also his occult philosophy, and amongst his surviving papersthere is a geomantic manuscript.8The activities of this small group left German-town with a long-lasting reputation for magic.Germantown’s only rival in terms of occult standing was Ephrata, which is nowin Lancaster County. Its founder was Conrad Beissel (1690–1768), a Pietist bakerwho had arrived in Germantown in1720expecting to find Kelpius’s movementalive and well. Disillusioned with the various sects he found instead, he set forthinto the Pennsylvanian wilderness and formed his own monastic-like communityfor men and women who came to be known as German Seventh Day Baptists.One of their main activities was the creation of impressive illuminated manu-scripts. With the installation of a printing press in1745the Ephrata communityalso became a major centre of Gothic type German language publication, andproducer of the occasional mystical and magical publication.9The private libraries of wealthy colonialists and Protestant mystics were not theonly repositories of European occultism. That admirable eighteenth-centuryurban institution, the subscription library, also provided access to magical know-ledge for those who had a few shillings to spare annually and the time to perusetheir holdings. The very first such institution, the Library Company of Phila-delphia, founded in1731by Benjamin Franklin, had, by the early nineteenthcentury accumulated a1651edition of Scot’sDiscoverie, the1651translation ofAgrippa’sThree Books of Occult Philosophy, the1658edition of Porta’sNaturalMagic, and a1650Latin edition as well.

Subscription libraries spread along the eastern seaboardduring the second half of the century and some of them held at least one or two ofthe key works. The New York Society Library, to which some of JohnWinthrop’s books were donated, possessed a1584edition of Scot’sDiscoverie.11During the mid-nineteenth century grimoires also moved west with the goldprospectors. In1854the San Francisco Mercantile Library housed a copy ofAgrippa’sThree Booksand an edition of theArbatel of Magic, presumably extractedfrom Turner’s edition of theFourth Book of Occult Philosophyor a rare eighteenth-century edition.12While admission to these libraries, whether private or public,was restricted to a very small percentage of the population, they confirm thatAmerica had its own palaces of occult enlightenment. It is not unlikely, further-more, that these repositories generated manuscript grimoires produced by copyistswho did have access.So far, our history of American magic has concerned the books that immigrantstook with them. It was only during the late seventeenth century that printingpresses were permitted in English territories. Around the same time the Frenchhad banned all publishing in New France. Tellingly, the first publication producedby the first printing office in Pennsylvania was an astrological almanac released in1685, and others followed. The success of theAmerican Almanack, compiled byDaniel and Titan Leeds, which ran during the early eighteenth century, showsthere was considerable demand for such occult aid. Titan Leeds was the butt ofBenjamin Franklin’s satirical wit when, in1732, Franklin launched his own mockastrological guide entitledPoorRichard’s Almanack. Franklin was one of the mostinfluential men in eighteenth-century America, a scientist, statesman, and later anational hero for his role in ensuring the success of American Independence.PoorRichard’spurported author was an astrologer and ‘friend’ of Titan Leeds namedRichard Saunders. Over the next few yearsPoorRichard’s Almanackregularlyspeculated on Leeds’ death, to his understandable chagrin. The mock formulawas as big a success as the earnest astrological almanac, selling up to10,000copiesannually during the quarter century of its existence.13Some no doubt bought itunder a misapprehension as to its contents. Years later, Franklin’s spoof would bethe first American ‘occult’ publication to make a significant impression back acrossthe Atlantic. One French edition of PoorRichard’s collected advice was translatedunder the titlele Chemin de la fortune, suivie de la veritable Poule Noire, ou laConnaissance des tre ́sors, and in Sweden asGamleRichards Swartkonst-bok.14Ineach case the popular fascination with grimoires was used to lure people intoreading a determinedly rationalist message.Across the Oceans|143"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Until the late eighteenth century run-of-the-mill chapbooks were importedfrom Britain in large numbers. They were reproduced locally only when importsdid not match demand, and this was due more to the economic restrictions of achronic shortage of rags for paper than the hindrance of the censors.15We getsome sense of the influence of and concerns regarding such literature from thewritings ofRevd Ebenezer Turell of Medford, Massachusetts. He had maintaineda sceptical stance during a local case involving some girls who maliciously claimedto be tormented by witches, and evidently considered popular literature, and the‘devil’s playthings’ it contained, to be responsible in part for the continuance ofsuch pernicious beliefs. He wrote in1720, ‘Young people would do wisely nowto lay aside all their foolish books, their trifling ballads, and all romantick accountsof dreams and trances, senseless palmistry and groundless astrology’.16It was not until after the War of Independence that American publishers beganto pump out the wide range of chapbooks available on the Continent. Amongstthem, inevitably, were versions of the run-of-the-mill cheap fortune-telling anddream books that had proved so popular in England, such asThe New Book ofKnowledgepublished in Boston in the1760s, andThe Universal Interpreter of Dreamsand Visions(1795).17The popularity of such literature was boosted further by thehuge growth of legal and illicit lotteries—the urban treasure trove of the nine-teenth century. In1826one critic of these lotteries described how whole streetswere being converted into lottery shops, with ‘boys standing at every corner tothrust printed schemes and advertisements of lucky lottery offices into the hands ofthe passers by.’18The most popular of the schemes was the policy system basedon the selection of three numbers. By mid-century American dream booksincluded three-number combinations in relation to different visions. One edition,for example, attached the numbers2,7, and41to dreams about ants.19Several versions of the enduringly popular Dr Faust chapbook were printed inPennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut during the1790s. As elsewhere,they may have excited some young men to seek out the means of conjuring up theDevil. The story was no doubt already well known to both English and Germansettlers in the colonial period.20But otherwise, during the nineteenth century, theseeker of practical magic in America remained dependent primarily on seven-teenth-century English printed editions and German manuscripts. Until thepublication of John George Hohman’sDer lang verborgene Freundin1820, whichwill be discussed in a later chapter, all that was produced other than astrologicalalmanacs and simple fortune-telling tracts were the decorative, German languagehouse-blessings and celestial letters orHimmelsbriefprinted in Ephrata and else-where in Pennsylvania.21As in northern Europe, copies of these blessings andapocryphal correspondence were commonly hung on walls or kept on the personto protect against illness during childbirth, fire, and evil.144|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"So far I have been exploring the presence and possession of grimoires as part ofa wider emigration of occultism across the North Atlantic, but to what extentwere they actually used and for what? There is certainly little evidence that any ofthe educated elite with their large libraries actually practised spirit conjurationsand the like; their occult interests were mostly philosophical, astrological, oralchemical. By the early nineteenth century, however, the Germantown mysticswere characterized as practical magicians in reminiscence and folklore. A historyof Pennsylvania written in1829suggested that although Witt’s medical practiceflourished, the ‘superstition of his neighbours, probably rendered his profession ofnecromancy the more lucrative.’ He acted as a cunning-man, detecting thewhereabouts of stolen goods, identifying thieves, and combating witchcraft.22He was also said to have trained up others in the practical occult arts including hissuccessor in the cunning-trade Dr Frailey, a Germantown resident whose one-story house was decorated with German poetry painted in oil colours.23As to thereality, Witt, Lehman, and other leading Germantown residents like John Seeligcertainly cast nativities and followed astrological principles—Witt evidently on acommercial basis. He provided a certificate, an example of which survives, to atleast one student confirming his successful training in the ‘Arts & Mysteries ofChemistry, Physick, & Astral Sciences’.24As to the use of practical magic garneredfrom grimoires, the main evidence is the corpus ofanha ̈ngselorzauber-zettel,amulets and talismans, created by the occult adepts of the Pennsylvanian GermanPietists for the benefit of their communities. These magical lamens, containingastrological and angelic signs like those espoused by Paracelsus, were usuallydrawn on parchment and paper and were widely worn among German settlersto ward off evil spirits, witchcraft, gunshot, and ill health. Some were engraved orstamped in brass, silver, and even gold. A nineteenth-century historian of theGermantown mystics possessed one such brass, awunder-sigel, which was warmedwith a flame and impressed on the skin of humans and animals at the spot wheretheir malady was manifest while a charm was spoken. This branding techniquewas also used to prevent cattle from straying or being stolen—something you donot see in Hollywood westerns.25Pirate treasureAs in Europe, the search for treasure provides us with the most referencesregarding the use of grimoires in the eighteenth century. America may not havebeen dotted with the ruined monasteries, castles, stone circles, dolmens, and hillforts that attracted treasure legends across Europe, but this did not prevent settlersfrom creating a new geography of treasure—one based on buried pirate bootyAcross the Oceans|145"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"supposedly secreted by the notorious William Kidd and Jean Lafitte, lost Spanishgold mines, and ancient Indian treasure.26The West may have had its gold rush inthe mid-nineteenth century but, long before, the countryside of the northeasternAtlantic seaboard was dotted with the explorations of those seeking hidden riches.In1729Benjamin Franklin co-wrote a newspaper essay highlighting the ‘prob-lem’, bemoaning the great number of labouring people who were bringing theirfamilies to the brink of ruin in search of ‘imaginary treasures’. The physical signs oftheir activities were apparent around and about Philadelphia. ‘You can hardlywalk half a mile out of Town on any side, without observing several Pits dug withthat Design,’ Franklin moaned. He took a particular swipe at the role of astrolo-gers, ‘with whom the Country swarms at this Time’, in promoting such fruitlessendeavour. The article contained a mock letter from one such devotee of thecelestial art who boasts of having ‘read over Scot, Albertus Magnus, and CorneliusAgrippa above300times’. A hundred years later the town’s residents could stillpoint out the various spots were holes had been dug.27It is possible that thepopular preoccupation with treasure hunting during the eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries was fertilized by German immigrants. Although Englandhad long had a tradition of treasure hunting, which had caused particular concernto the authorities in the mid-sixteenth century, by the eighteenth century it wasby no means as strong as it was in parts of Germany, where as we have seennumerous prosecutions took place during the eighteenth century.The author of a1767comic opera—indeed the first American opera—wrote inthe preface that it was partly written with the aim ‘to put a stop (if possible) to thefoolish and pernicious practice of searching after supposed hidden treasure’.28Theplot of theDisappointmentconcerns four Pennsylvanian gentlemen who test thecredulity and cupidity of four tradesmen by concocting a story of Blackbeard’shidden booty, the location of which is revealed in a map sent by the English sister-in-law of one of the pranksters. One of the gentlemen,Rattletrap, pretends to be aconjuror, no doubt modelled on the Germantown magi, who offers to use hismagical knowledge to ward off the spirits of Blackbeard’s crew, which guard thetreasure. Amongst his accoutrements are a hazel staff, magnet, telescope, anancient quilted nightcap, and a ‘brass bound magic book’. ‘This book my wonderscontain’, he boasts, ‘Twou’d deceive the devil himself, And puzzle a conjuror’sbrain.’ He learns some arcane words from reading the canto of Hudibras andSydrophel, which together with his mathematical knowledge ‘qualify him for amodern conjuror’.29At the site where the treasure is said to be hiddenRattletrapdraws a large circle in the ground with his wand and plants twelve pieces of wirearound it each with a paper cut into the shape of a star. Then the pseudo-conjurations begin, ‘Diapaculum interravo, tenebrossitas stravaganza!’30In a sideplot a female character also pretends that a ‘Dutch almanac’ is a grimoire,146|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"explaining, ‘you must know when I was about fifteen years of age, I lived atGermantown with my uncle, a high German Doctor, who could tell fortunes,find stolen goods, discover hidden treasure, lay spirits, and raise the devil. And hiswhole art is contained in this little book.’31TheDisappointmentis generally thought to have been written by ColonelThomas Forrest (1747–1825), a Philadelphian congressman who in his roustaboutyouth pulled off a very similar prank to that recounted in the opera. He gulled aGerman printer into believing that he possessed the dying testimony of a piratenamed Hendricks, who was hanged at Tyburn, in which he revealed where hehad buried his pot of money. The tailor called in an adept of the black art namedAmbruster, who said he could conjure up Hendricks to give up his booty.Ambruster’s method required no grimoire though, as he merely shuffled andread out cards on which were inscribed the names of the New Testament saints.32As elsewhere, conjurations were not necessarily required to retrieve buriedtreasure. Divining rods, which had a pseudo-scientific reputation, were used tolocate precious metals for example. But as treasure was often thought to beguarded by the spirits of pirate prisoners and slaves, deliberately killed so theirghosts were bound to protect their masters’ booty, none but the most rationaltreasure hunter dismissed the importance of supernatural aid.33American treasureseekers seem to have relied mostly on the Bible and the psalms rather than magicalconjurations, though there are examples of magic circles being employed. Whilethis is understandable, considering the Bible was the only widely available occultrepository during the eighteenth century, English grimoires with explicit treas-ure-seeking advice, namely Scot’sDiscoverieand theFourth Book of Occult Philoso-phy, were present in America. Furthermore, although there is no mention of theSt Christopher Prayer in American sources, it is quite possible that ethnic Germansettlers brought copies with them. In the late nineteenth century, Americaneditions of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswere used.34Digging deeperinto the history of grimoires in American treasure hunting brings us to the mostcontentious and current debate regarding magic in America—the occult activitiesof the founder of the Mormons.Mormons and magic booksJoseph Smith (1805–44) was brought up on a poor farm near the town of Palmyrain New York State. During the1820s he and his family were involved in a series ofexpeditions looking for ancient treasure and Spanish silver mines in and aroundthe area, and further afield in Pennsylvania. Smith Snr and Jnr were useful peopleto have along as they were reputed for their divinatory skills, particularly the use ofAcross the Oceans|147"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"seer- or peep-stones in which they could see visions of hidden treasures and muchelse besides. It is clear that the Smiths, like other treasure seekers at the time, alsoemployed magic circles and talismans in order to deal with guardian spirits. SmithJnr also claimed to have received divine communications. From1823onwards hewas subject to a series of visitations from an angel named Moroni, son of theprophet Mormon, who, according to Smith, had been a soldier and historianduring the reign of an ancient American civilization that collapsed around400 ad.Moroni told Smith that he was the guardian of two golden plates containing achronicle of its thousand-year existence. The Lord God Jesus Christ had orderedMormon to compile it and Moroni completed it. Moroni told Smith he hadburied this ‘Golden Bible’ in a stone box in a hill not far from Palmyra after a greatdefining battle between the Nephites and Lamanites. These were two Israelitetribes who arrived in the promised land of America around600 bc. In September1827Moroni let it be known that Smith was to be permitted to dig up the goldenplates in order to translate the hidden history they contained. The Book ofMormon was born.35During the early years of the Mormon movement critics used rumours andtestimonies of Smith’s treasure-hunting and magical activities to denounceand ridicule his nascent Church. As the movement eventually grew in numbersand influence after its move to Utah, the focus on its activities shifted away frommagic and treasure to the controversial practice of polygamy. During the1970sand early1980s, however, Mormon and non-Mormon scholars began an earnestreappraisal of the occult activities of Smith and his early followers. In1985widerpublic awareness of Smith’s treasure seeking was reignited. Mark Hofmann, awell-known dealer in early Mormon archives, claimed he had discovered thewritten testimony of an early Mormon regarding Smith’s experience of diggingfor Moroni’s golden plates. Known as the ‘White Salamander Letter’, it relatedhow Smith had encountered a salamander in the stone-lined pit containing theplates, which transformed itself into a guardian spirit that initially denied him thetreasure. When suspicion was aroused about the authenticity of the letter andother Mormon artefacts Hofmann had sold to the Church, he tried to cover histracks by setting two bombs for people he had dealt with, killing two. He is nowserving a life sentence.Of all the books and articles that appeared in the1970s and1980s it was a studyby the Mormon historian Michael Quinn,Early Mormonism and the Magic WorldView, that caused the most controversy. Quinn synthesized a huge amount ofprimary and secondary sources to trace the origins of and influences on JosephSmith’s magical practices, and how they fed into early Mormonism. A revisededition was published in1998in which Quinn bolstered his claims with extensiveendnote references, and prefaced it with a self-reflexive account of how the148|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"critical reception of the original book had impacted on his professional andpersonal life. As a Mormon, Quinn came under sustained attack for his work,losing his professorship at Brigham Young University. Quinn argued that thecontent of theBook of Mormon, whether written by Smith or divinely translated byhim, was influenced by the literary tradition of early modern and eighteenth-century hermeticism, Kabbalah, and mysticism.36Others had already made theseconnections but Quinn went further than anyone in trying to trace the exactsources of Smith’s magical possessions.Quinn analysed three surviving magical parchments, and a dagger inscribedwith the occult Seal of Mars, all of which the Smith family had evidentlycherished.37One of the Smith charms, described as the ‘Holiness to the Lord’,concerned the communication with good angels. Another, ‘Saint Peter bindthem’, served a protective function, and the third, ‘Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah’,was also a protective amulet.38Quinn rightly suggested that several of the symbolsthey contained were taken variously from Scot’sDiscoverie(1584), the ‘discourse’attached to the1665edition ofDiscoverie, or extracts reprinted in Sibly’sNew andComplete Illustration of the Occult Sciences.39The ‘Saint Peter bind them’ and‘Holiness to the Lord’ parchments, for example, contained the symbol of theangel Nalgah, which was only depicted in the1665edition of Scot’sDiscoverieandSibly’s opus. The ‘Holiness to the Lord’ charm also contained a magical seal foundin all editions of Scot’sDiscoverie. Quinn also believed that a silver talisman orlamen with the seal of Jupiter possessed by Joseph Smith had been copied fromone in Barrett’sThe Magus.40He further suggested, less convincingly, that asymbol of the Moon consisting of two back-to-back crescents presented in theMaguswas also the source for Smith’s prophecy to another prominent Mormon,Alpheus Cutler, that ‘two crescent moons with their backs together’ would appearto him when the time had come to reorganize the church.41Quinn’s reconstruction of the popular magical beliefs of the social milieu inwhich the Smiths and their followers lived is convincing, and is supported by thework of other historians of eighteenth-century American religious cultures.Furthermore, as we have seen, it mirrors the continuance of similar magictraditions in the European countries from where the Smiths and their followersemigrated. While there is no evidence that the Smiths owned copies of Scot,Sibly, or Barrett, there is little doubt that the Smith parchments were used forovertly magical protective purposes, and were derived primarily from Scot andSibly. Yet Quinn’s conviction, that the Smiths were practitioners of traditionalmagic was outrageous, even heretical, to the hierarchy of the Church of the LatterDay Saints.Numerous attacks were launched against Quinn’s thesis, but I shall focus onthat of the Mormon scholar William J. Hamblin published in2000. In thisAcross the Oceans|149"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"lengthy, scholarly, and meticulous rebuttal, Quinn’s book was described as ‘un-mitigated nonsense’, and Hamblin further advised that it ‘should not be takenseriously as history’.42Part of Hamblin’s critique rests on the availability andnature of occult literature in late-eighteenth-century America. Hamblin makessome pertinent criticisms. Quinn certainly conflated cheap and easily availablefortune-telling tracts and astrological works with grimoires and other scarce worksof intellectual magic. In doing so he gave the impression that magical literaturecirculated widely in Philadelphia and New York State at the time. Yet by thisperiod American astrological almanacs, as in England, had very little magical or‘occult’ content.43I am also inclined to agree with Hamblin that it is highlyunlikely that the Smiths owned a copy of or had access to Barrett’sThe Magus.44True, as we saw earlier, there were copies available in American libraries at thetime, but a few years after its publication it had already become a rarity in Englandlet alone America, and second-hand copies were expensive. When a copy ofTheMagusowned by the English-born American theatre impresario William Burtonwas auctioned in1860it was described as ‘extremely rare’.45A copy sold inEngland the year before was advertised as ‘very scarce’ and cost £18s.46Forthis reason there is little evidence of English cunning-folk possessing or usingTheMaguslet alone American ones.When it comes to the sources for what Quinn asserted were Smith’s ritual knifefor making a magic circle, Hamblin overplays the scarcity of Scot’sDiscoveryas apossible source. For Hamblin it ‘is the least likely that Joseph would haveobtained’.47In fact it is the most likely. The1651and1665editions werefrequently being sold at auction in England during the late eighteenth centuryfor a price usually between5and8s.In1772the bookseller Benjamin White evenoffered a copy of the1651edition for a very reasonable2s.6d.48Compare theseprices with the first edition of Sibly’sNew and Complete Illustration, which wasbeing sold for between £19s. and £115s. during the early1790s—more than fouror five times the average price of the much older Scot editions.49It is hardlybeyond the realms of possibility that some of these editions went overseas and intothe hands of humble Americans on the eastern seaboard. As to Sibly’sNew andComplete Illustration, which Hamblin describes as so rare that he was unable toconsult an edition, numerous reprints in the early nineteenth century would havemade it realistically purchasable.50It was certainly quite widely used by Englishcunning-folk. Furthermore, Hamblin’s belief that Scot’sDiscoveriewas not used asa book of magic—‘it is not a book designed to help someone learn how to be amagician’—is also contradicted by the English evidence.51It has been shown thattheDiscoveriewas a key source of magic charms during the nineteenth century,with the character of Nalgah and the magical seal in Smith’s ‘Holiness to the Lord’charm being used in charms concocted by English and Welsh cunning-folk.52150|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Fig.15Reginald Scot,The Discoverie of Witchcraft(London,1665)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Quinn’s thesis does not stand or fall on the basis that Smith owned copies of Scotand Sibly, since extracts from all three were to be found in the manuscriptgrimoires and charms kept by some English cunning-folk, and in those sold bythe London occult bookseller John Denley. It is quite likely that some of thesefound their way to America where they were copied once again.It is not surprising that the Mormon faith was, in part, born out of the magicalmilieu of the period. Whether Protestant or Catholic, German or British, magicwas a central aspect of most people’s conception of Christianity in colonialAmerica. Colonization itself was inspired not only by commerce but also bysupernatural inspiration. Confronted by the challenges of their new world,European emigrants, insecure as to their future, understandably placed relianceon the magic of their homeland cultures. The search for treasure was part of awider quest for security. Cunning-folk, and diviners like the Smiths, were,therefore, valued members of their communities, and more so if they wereperceived to have physical and linguistic access to literary as well as oral sourcesof occult power.New FranceDuring the early nineteenth century a group of Pennsylvanian German farmers,Mennonites and Amish, trekked north and settled in Ontario, mostly in what isnow Waterloo County. They brought with them their distinctive magical rem-edies and folk medicine, and theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosescan be found inlegends recorded in their communities at the end of the century.53But it was theFrench grimoire tradition and not the German that had the most substantialinfluence on Canadian popular magic.The history of French emigration to Canada contrasts strikingly with that ofGermans and the British to North America.54The Catholic French were reluctantemigrants, and the Huguenots were barred from settling in French territories. By theend of the seventeenth century New France covered a huge swathe of the easternhalf of America and Canada, but it was only in the latter that emigration wassignificant enough to generate a lasting French cultural presence. Quebec wasfounded in1608, and two other permanent settlements, Trois-Rivie`res and Mon-treal, had developed into small towns within a few decades. Yet although at least27,000French came to Canada in the period from1608until its surrender tothe British in1763, some two-thirds returned to their homes, predominantly inNormandy, Poitou, and the Paris basin. By that time, French Canada or Quebec hada population of around70,000, made up primarily of those born in the territorydescended from seventeenth-century pioneers, along with disbanded soldiers,152|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"refugees from Acadia (mostly consisting of the former French territory of NovaScotia), and petty criminals exiled there during a period of penal transportationbetween1721and1749. Following British rule French emigration reduced to a tinytrickle. In the1851census only359people in Quebec had been born in France.55In June1682a Montreal innkeeper Anne Lamarque was tried for practisingmagic principally on the basis of her possession of a mysterious book. Anne wasborn in the diocese of Bordeaux and was married to another emigrant namedCharles Testard, who was fromRouen. Their hostelry was evidently popular, butthe downside was that gossip soon spread amongst her customers regarding a bookthat she was seen holding. Numerous witnesses came forward to testify that theyhad seen her with a ‘book of magic or sorcery’. One described it as a ‘huge bookfour or five inches square and the thickness of a finger or thereabouts, handwrit-ten, in a bold hand and in both French and Latin, and some Greek words’. Seriousdoubt was cast on the evil nature of this book, however, when one witness, alodger whose curiosity had been aroused by the gossip, testified that he had askedher if it was true that she had a book of magic in Latin and Greek. She replied thatit was no such thing, it was merely ‘a book of herbs or medicines’.56We find little further evidence regarding grimoires in Canada until the nine-teenth century, though as Lamarque’s case shows, rumours about them circulated.It is likely that some copies of thePetit Albertfound their way there in the packs ofsettlers and soldiers before the British takeover. Copies could also have beenbrought over and traded by seamen. In the early twentieth century a Quebecman told a folklorist how an uncle had come by a copy of thePetit Albertfromsome French sailors and had lent it to his family. His father threw it into the fire.57Despite the potential demand, however, in1861it was estimated that no morethan twenty-five to thirty copies could be found in the province.58If this was so,then thePetit Albert’scultural influence far outweighed its actual presence inQuebec society. It was central to Canada’s early literary heritage. Just as the firstAmerican opera was concerned with treasure hunts and magic books, so the firstFrench-Canadian novel,L’Influence d’un livre, similarly centred on alchemy,treasure, and thePetit Albert—the ‘livre’ in the title.59Written in1837by Philippe Aubert de Gaspe ́, the son of a Quebec lawyer, thisgothic story primarily concerned a poor Canadian alchemist called Charles Amand,who in the1820s could be found in his cabin on the south bank of the St LaurentRiver poring over hisPetit Albertday and night in his quest to create precious metals.A footnote in the text referring to one of his failed ritual conjurations to achieve thisgoal notes that Amand’sPetit Albertwas not one of the run-of-the-mill copies of thegrimoire. His ‘true’ copy was tellingly obtained from a Frenchman.60The story alsoconcerns the search for hidden treasure and the desire to obtain the Hand of Glory,the recipe for which was the most notorious aspect of thePetit Albert. One reviewerAcross the Oceans|153"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"criticized the way that the novel portrayed his countryman as being so ‘superstitious’as to practise magical rituals, and thought it would have been appropriate to set itfurther back in time before education had enlightened the people.61In1861a book was published in Quebec with the enticing titleLe Ve ́ritable Petit-Albert ou secret pour acque ́rir un tre ́sor. But this was not the first Canadian grimoire. It wasan attack on such works by a Quebec typographer and social commentator namedJoseph-Norbert Duquet. The first half of the book provided an account of the historyand content of the corpus of chapbook grimoires available in France at the time. Todemonstrate their pernicious influence he also provided some accounts of the recentprosecution of cunning-folk in the mother country. He then went on to relatevarious cases of treasure seeking in Quebec. The second half of the book consisted ofa discussion on the social and economic structure of the province along with‘improving’ advice and rational recipes for the labouring classes of Quebecto whom the book was dedicated. His concern was that Canada should defend itselffrom the corrupting forces at play in Europe and America, amongst them theinfluence of thePetit Albertand other populist occult works. These had ‘spreadstrongly in America; but fortunately in Canada, we can say with rightful pride, we arefar from the sale of thousands of copies of this cheating book to the inhabitants of ourrural areas.’ Duquet was a staunch supporter of the social and moral importance of theChurch in Que ́be ́cois society, and he praised its role in suppressing thePetit Albert,as well as commending the French-Canadian libraries that refused to stock it.62For Duquet the most obvious sign of thePetit Albert’s influence in Quebec wasthe continued practice of magical treasure hunting in the province. In1843, forexample, a group tried to conjurer up a treasure guarded by ghosts buried in oraround Chateau Mctavish near Montreal, which was built in the late eighteenthcentury by a hugely wealthy Scottish fur trader and businessman. As to those whoengaged in such activities, Duquet wrote:Tell him that you have thePetit-Albert, or some other book of marvelloussecrets, and then you can be certain of pulling at the heartstrings of all hisdesires. You will see his face bloom with happiness, his eyes light up,mouth open, and his chest heave, a sigh escapes followed by this request:‘Ah! Monsieur, if you would be so good as to provide me with thePetit-Albert, or theDragon rougeor else theGrimoire, you would make me happya thousand times’.63Duquet’s book was a massive hit in Quebec publishing terms. It sold3,000copiesin a matter of weeks, at a time when successful novels sold only a thousand copiesor so.64While his aim was to destroy the belief in grimoires surely the only reasonfor the book’s success was that many people bought it under the mistakenassumption that it was an edition of the actualPetit Albert.154|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The influence of French grimoires is more difficult to assess in Louisiana, theonly area of North America that maintained a substantial French language cultureafter the demise of New France.

Furthermore, any consideration ofFrench influence on magical cultures in the region needs to consider the inputof Creoles, French-speaking Native American Indians and, most significantly,slaves and ex-slaves. Eighteenth-century advertisements regarding runaway slaves,mostly from Louisiana and St Domingue but also from across the eastern seaboard,confirm that French was quite widely spoken amongst the black population, andby the early nineteenth century French-speaking slaves and former slaves were amajor influence on French language and culture in the southern states.65One rare nineteenth-century reference to thePetit Albertin Louisiana is in GeorgeW. Cable’s classic novel ofVoodoo, racism, and murder in New Orleans,TheGrandissimes, published in1880but set in1803.ItcontainsasceneinwhichaParis-educated ‘free man of color’, Honore ́Grandissime, visits a German-AmericanNew Orleans apothecary to obtain a love powder. ‘M‘sieu’,’ he asks, ‘vous eˆtesastrologue—magicien’. ‘God forbid!’, replies the apothecary.‘You godd one ‘P‘tit Albert.’He dropped his forefinger upon an iron-clasped book on the table,whose title much use had effaced.‘That is the Bible. I do not know what the Tee Albare is!’This literary reference is hardly concrete evidence of the grimoire’s use at thetime, but the scenario is perfectly reasonable. If thePetit Albertwas a significantelement in the magical cultures of French Louisiana it was most likely due toCaribbean rather than Acadian influence. As one recent major study of CreoleFrench culture affirms, throughout the Creole world the ‘Petit Albert, GrandAlbert, and to a lesser extent,Dragon rougeare major and constant references.’66How did this come about?CreolizationColonization, slavery, and immigrant labour in the Caribbean and the Americasgenerated a fascinating and diverse fusion of beliefs and practices regardingreligion, magic, and medicine, derived from European, African, Asian, indigenousAcross the Oceans|155"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Carib, and Amerindian cultures. In the British colonies theOrishareligiondeveloped in Trinidad and Tobago, and in Jamaica we find the collection ofmagical practices known asObeah.

Most well known outside the regionis, of course, the Haitian spirit religionVoodoo.67The African influence in thesereligious traditions depended on the tribes from which different slaving countriestook their terrible cargo. The African elements inComfacan be identified asBantu, while the wordObeahderives from the Ashanti. Elsewhere Yoruba beliefswere a major influence inSanterı\u0002aandVoodoo. The latter, also termedvaudou,vodou, andvodounat different periods and in different cultural contexts, means‘spirit’, and derives, along with other deities in its pantheon, from a group of WestAfrican languages spoken particularly in the kingdoms of the Yoruba and Fon.68Turning to the European influences, Catholicism and its demonology dominatesnot surprisingly. After all, up until the mid-nineteenth century, it was the onlypermitted religion across much of the region. But the Church’s conception ofCatholic worship was far from uniformly understood and adhered to in Europeanpopular cultures. White migrants brought with them their own folk conceptionsof the magical efficacy of religious practices, which had affinities with other non-European cultures. Saints, African deities, and indigenous spirits could rub alongtogether, while charms and talismans were adapted to incorporate the magicalpotency of local flora and fauna. Just one example of this is the tradition ofmandingapouches in Brazil. As a series of eighteenth-century Inquisition trialsreveal, these protective pouches were a fusion of the African Islamic tradition ofthealhercescontaining passages from the Koran, the European tradition of wearingprinted or written prayers mingled with occult symbols, and indigenous amulets.One of those confiscated by the Inquisition, and used to instil bravery consisted ofa prayer to Jesus and St Cyprian and a piece of altar stone. Others contained a deadman’s bone.69Scholarly interpretations of the processes by which these new religious andmagical traditions grew out of the established religions of Europe, Africa, and to alesser extent India, have changed over the past fifty years or so. The concept of‘acculturation’ was widely applied until recently. In historical and anthropologicalcontexts the acculturation process has been understood generally in terms ofdominant cultures, usually European or American, deliberately supplanting orsuppressing what were seen as inferior or less ‘advanced’ cultures, by means offorce, religion, education, and media. This concept, however, does not entirelysquare with religious developments in the Caribbean. What European authoritiesattempted in terms of promoting and enforcing Christianity, and suppressing156|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"African beliefs and practices, by outlawingObeahfor example, was certainlyacculturation. But they did not fully succeed. Aspects of Christian liturgy, pri-marily Catholic, were key ingredients in the syncretism or blending of religioustraditions that took place because of, and to a certain extent in defiance of,colonial rule. The term creolization—creolereferring to persons born in the regionwho have non-native ancestry—encapsulates better this complex creative process,which was beyond authoritarian control. The creolization of religion and magicmay have been forged out of cultural repression and violence, but its developmentwas one of continuing cultural negotiation, fusion, and adaptation.The European literary esoteric tradition, as well as the oral, played a major partin this creolization of Caribbean beliefs. The Bible was, of course, hugelyinfluential, but for a more recent introduction we can look to the growth ofKardecism. In the mid-nineteenth century a French schoolteacher and author ofpedagogical texts, Hippolyte Le ́onRivail, developed a spiritualist doctrine distinctfrom the American spiritualism born in1848. ForRivail contact with the spirits ofthe dead convinced him of the reality of reincarnation, opening up a newphilosophical and moral doctrine for life and the afterlife. It was during a seancethat spirits informed him that his name in a former life was Allan Kardec, and itwas this he adopted when writing his most important works,The Book of the Spirits(1857),The Book of Mediums(1861), andThe Gospel According to Spiritism(1864).70Within a few years they had been translated into Spanish and quickly becamehugely influential in Latin America—more so than in Europe. They were adoptedinitially by the liberal middle classes who were disillusioned by the conservativepolitical grip of the Church. By the twentieth centuryThe Gospel According toSpiritismwas apparently achieving better sales than the Bible in PuertoRico,despite being banned.71Kardecism also flourished in Brazil with the first Spiritistsociety being created in the late1860s in the face of hostility from the CatholicChurch. Over the decades, Brazilian Spiritism developed into a form distinct fromKardec’s initial teachings. It became a religion rather than a philosophical-ethicalsystem, feeding into other Afro-Brazilian religious systems, such asUmbanda,which are based on the healing abilities of mediums working through spiritcommunications.72The reception and absorption of European grimoires in South and CentralAmerica was rather more complex. Seen as potent sources of physical as well asspiritual empowerment, grimoires were viewed by some indigenous peoples as thepernicious tools of foreign colonizers. The Quiche ́Indians of Guatemala, forinstance, came to believe that some sorcerers (ajitz) who caused harm learnedtheir powers from books of magic, described to one anthropologist as ‘books of theJews’.73For some indigenous Indians in southwest Colombiamagia, which theydefine as deriving from books of conjurations that allow one to pact with the Devil,Across the Oceans|157"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"are considered to be an instrument of social control. The whites had broughtmagiawith them, and as one Indian complained, ‘They use it to take our land.’74Theseperceptions were not only born of suspicions regarding Christian magic but werealso an aspect of wider concerns about how books were being used as a means ofenslavement. We see this expressed in a magic tradition found amongst the largelyindigenous Quichua population of the town of Salasaca, Ecuador. In the provincialcapital of Ambato lies the seat of a ‘witch-saint’, Saint Gonzalo, patron of the mainchurch, who is believed to kill people through a book in which victims’ names arewritten. The main focus of this belief was not the large statue of San Gonzalo,which depicts him with a sword plunged into his back and blood trickling down hisface, but a small copy of the statue in private ownership. It is theblancos(whites)who own the latter, and who are the guardians of a large ‘witch book’. People paythem to include the names of their enemies, who the saint will then curse, orconversely to have their names removed. This is no legend, but a real money-making activity for the guardians, who have on at least one occasion been chargedwith adding names to the book to extort money.The anthropologist who studied this tradition, and was surprised and suspiciousto find his own name in the book during a visit, suggests it is not just the book andthe power of writing that has shaped this belief and practice.75It is the implicitassociation Salasacas make between it and their experience of record keeping bythe predominantly white Church and secular administration. The witch book isno mock grimoire with occult signs and pictures of the Devil; it is a functionallarge notebook consisting of lined paper, not unlike those used for CivilRegistryand Church record keeping. In other words, the archival function of books,which serve as a means of social control in an administrative sense, can also beused to subjugate through magical means—an echo of the early modern witchtrials and the belief in the Devil’s book.In much of the Caribbean the pattern of colonial experience was different tothat of parts of Central and South America. Islands shuffled between Spanish,French, and British rule, with each colonial power imprinting their linguistic andcultural influence to varying degrees. The remnant indigenous populations had tonegotiate not only with European hegemony but also with the cultures of Africanand later Asian arrivals, and vice versa. The grimoire was not necessarily seenwholly as the white man’s legacy. In Martinique, Creole legends developedregarding theLivre Caraibe, which was thought to contain all the magical secretsof the Caribs written in Latin. People also told of notorious black magic bookswith ‘Holy Bible’ on the cover supposedly distributed by a St Lucian evangelistaround1900.76When the Haitian writer and communist activist JacquesRoumainwas incarcerated in Port-au-Prince prison during the late1920s, the country beingunder American occupation at the time, he requested a copy of William158|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Seabrook’s recently published populist account of Haitian magic andVoodoo,TheMagic Island, which was simultaneously published in French. His guard refusedsuspecting that he might use such a book to escape through magical means. Hissuspicions were understandable. Seabrook’s book provided translated excerptsfrom a Creole grimoire found on the body of the rebel commander BenoitBatraville, who was shot dead by American marines in1920. It included instruc-tions on how to call up the dead, a prayer against bullets, a charm to protect againsttorture, and a spell to ensure one’s release from prison.77The French connection: sacrifice and scienceIn1885a newspaper correspondent to thePhiladelphia Pressdescribed the accou-trements of the ‘West Indian Obeah Man’. They included a ‘cabalistic book (albeithe can seldom read), full of strange characters, crude figures, and roughly traceddiagrams and devices, which he pretends to consult in the exercise of his calling’.78One such manuscript was found on a magic worker named Adolphe Lacroix,executed in St Lucia in1876for the murder and mutilation of a disabled boy.79Afew years later a folklorist astutely remarked that ‘The book of magic, with itsdiagrams, sufficiently indicates that ‘‘Obeah’’ sorcery in the West Indies has beenaffected by European influences.’80The British may have been the most dominantcolonial power at the time, but it was the grimoires of their French rivals thatseeped deeply into the psyche of the Caribbean.Although, as we have seen, grimoires were present in early colonial America, itwas in the former French colonies that they first became a concrete, visible,attainable, and pervasive reality for people of whatever economic or ethnicbackground. To be more precise, it was the FrenchBibliothe`que bleuegrimoiresthat first gave the Caribbean its literary magic tradition. In Martinique, forinstance,La Poule noire, and theGrandandPetit Albertwere all frequently men-tioned in popular discourse on magic, and considered evil by those that did notuse them.Le Dragon rougewas perhaps the most evil of all, it being thought that theDevil could be summoned by standing under a fromager tree (Ceiba pentendra)with a copy. A perusal of the libraries of Martinique cunning-men orquimboiseurs,and those in the Antilles, reveals that theAlberttitles andLe Dragon rougewerecommon enough. A Guadeloupe sorcerer prosecuted in1953owned, amongst arange of more recent French works on exorcism and occultism,Le Dragon rougeand theGrandandPetit Albert.81However,La Poule Noire,Clavicule of Solomon,Grimoire du Pape Honorius, and theEnchiridion du Pape Le ́onwere more talkedabout than circulated on the island.82It was thePetit Albertthat had the mostdemonstrable influence on magical practices.Across the Oceans|159"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"In the British Windward Islands during the early twentieth century there wassome suspicion that the French-speaking portion of the population practised themore sinister aspects ofObeah.Robert Stephen Earl, a British Commissioner andmedical officer in the Virgin Islands at the time, observed that blood was moreimportant amongstpatoisspeakers in the Leeward Islands, particularly in Domin-ica, which although it had been ceded to Britain in1763retained a strong Frenchinfluence. In the Virgin Islands police had arrested one man with numerousObeahaccoutrements who was returning from Santa Domingo (DominicanRepublic).The same police force was also suspicious of a man who had recently arrived fromMartinique with a cock, which they suspected he subsequently sacrificed in orderto find treasure.83There was a strong Anglo-Saxon perception that there wassomething about the French that exacerbated the sinister aspects of Caribbean‘superstition’. One of America’s early leading sociologists, Ulysses G. Weatherly,wrote in1923that the French, in comparison with the English, weremore congenial to the simpler nature of the African. They had less of raceprejudice; they crossed more willingly with the blacks . . . . They also hadmore gaiety, a keener artistic and dramatic sense, and less rigorousattitudes. Once in full contact with French national culture, the Negrowas likely to readily absorb its type and long retain its influence.No surprise then, according to Weatherly’s view, that fragments of the ‘greatmagic books of the Middle Ages’ passed intoObeahand ‘the dim ghost of AlbertusMagnus flits in and out’.84One of his colleagues, the respected early-twentieth-century historian of the Caribbean, Frank Wesley Pitman, put a different emphasison the ‘failure’ of French policy. He postulated that the French authorities’ policyof education and the promotion of the assimilation of European culture backfired.‘Catholicism was fetishized by French Negroes,’ he explained, ‘and the almostcomplete reversion of Haytians to barbarism in the nineteenth century is a sadcommentary on the futility of the work of the French.’ The British, who had beenless dedicated in their educational provision, had, he thought, been more suc-cessful in eradicating ‘the atrocious tendencies of fetishism’.85British visitors to the country back in the1820s and1830s had already madesnide observations about the inability of the French-trained Catholic clergy tosuppress ‘superstition’ and ‘heathenism’.86While the British authorities explainedthis with smug reference to their better administration, later the finger alsopointed to the pernicious influence of French grimoires. They may have had apoint. It is possible the Martiniquan mentioned earlier was following the ritual ofthePoule noirecontained in theDragon rouge. Pitman suggested that the strengthofVoodooin Haiti was perhaps due to the fact that the ‘sacrificial prescriptionsfor child-murder, receipts for hidden treasure, and prayer formulas were early160|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"committed to print in a sort of manual for obeahmen published at Nantes in patoisand atrocious Latin.’ He meant thePetit Albert.87Animal sacrifice, usually a chicken, was certainly a part ofObeah, Comfa, andVoodoorituals, used as offerings to the spirits along with food and libations toensure good harvests and the like. The killing of a chicken and the sprinkling of itsblood was a common foundation ritual to ensure the protection of new dwellings.Such magic was an integral part of the religious worship in the West Africanregions from which most of their slave ancestors were taken, and similar founda-tion rituals requiring the burial of an animal were also widely practised in Europe.As we have seen, the sacrifice of a chicken was also a key element in diabolic pactsin France. In other words, such animal sacrifice was just another area of commontradition in the multicultural mix that was Creole magic. There was a widespreadbelief amongst Europeans that human sacrifice and even cannibalism were alsopractised by adherents ofVoodooin Haiti, and by magical practitioners in otherFrench-speaking colonies. Haiti’s pre-eminent and enduring reputation for ob-scene and horrificVoodoorituals was cemented by the popularity of the sensationalaccounts provided in Sir Spenser St John’sHayti, or the BlackRepublic(1884).St John was a well-travelled journalist who in1863took up a post ascharge ́d’affairesin Haiti, later becoming consul-general.88His stridently critical account of thecountry was reviled by Haitians but widely read in Europe and America. When itcame to a second edition in1889he added further details, stating he had‘underrated’ the ‘fearful manifestations’ ofVoodoo. His accounts of terribleVoodoorituals, seen as a hangover from the barbarous practices of African ancestors, weretaken as fact and became the key source on the subject for several decades. Theirapparent veracity was reinforced by St John’s account of a trial he had attended in1864concerning apparent sacrifice and cannibalism in the village of Bizoton, nearthe capital Port-au-Prince. Eight people were found guilty of murdering atwelve-year-old girl named Claircine and then eating her flesh for magicalpurposes.Even before the second edition ofHayti, or the BlackRepublicappeared, theAmerican folklorist William W. Newell was waging a scholarly campaign to dispelthe malodorous myth of child sacrifice that clung to the country.89He dismissedSt John’s accounts as unsubstantiated hearsay, highlighting the pernicious influ-ence of local and international newspapers in peddling sensational false accounts,such as the report that human flesh was on sale in Haitian markets.90As to the1864case, just like those in early modern Europe who confessed to participating inthe Sabbat, the defendants had been tortured into confessing their supposedheinous activities. St John reported that one young defendant pleaded in court,‘Yes, I did confess what you assert, but remember how cruelly I was beaten beforeI said a word.’ But to St John, who was no stranger to enacting brutal suppressionAcross the Oceans|161"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"on disturbers of the peace, torture seemed justified. He believed that the defend-ants had initially refused to speak due to believing that theirVoodoospirits wouldprotect them, and so ‘it required the frequent application of the club to drive thisbelief out of their heads.’91Newell consulted B. F. Whidden, the first minister ofthe United States to Haiti in the1860s, who had also been present at the trial.Whidden believed the prosecution was unfair and that the stories ofVoodoosacrifice and cannibalism circulating at the time were mere rumour sometimesmaliciously spread. There was no more cannibalism in Haiti than in Jamaica, heconcluded.Newell had his own theory as to the origin of the lurid legends ofVoodoosacrifice and cannibalism circulating in Haiti. They originated in old beliefs andsuperstitions regarding the diabolical activities of a medieval sect brought to theisland by French immigrants. This theory was built around the mistaken idea thatthe wordVoodooderived from the term ‘vaudois’, a name given to the followers ofthe medieval Waldensian heresy in Alpine France, which around the mid-fifteenth century became synonymous with satanic witchcraft.Vauderiebecameanother term for ‘sabbat’. Where Newell was right, however, was in underliningthat there was a significant French influence on the nature of sacrifice in Creolereligions. It was left to others to identify grimoires as the source of inspiration, andanother case of apparent ritual murder in1904seemed to confirm it.Rupert Mapp, a twelve year old was lured to the island of St Lucia from hishome in Bridgetown, Barbados, on the pretence that he would be employed as anerrand boy.92Mapp spoke only English and must have had little inkling of theplans being hatched for him during his brief time in French-speaking St Lucia.The man who brought him over was a licensed butcher and magical practitionernamed Edmond Montoute who had spent some time on Haiti, apparently evadingimprisonment for forgery. Montoute took the boy to the house of an old friendSt Luce Leon, a prosperous small farmer. There, on the night of29September,and with the help of another man Edgar St Hill, Mapp was strangled, his heart wasripped out and his hands cut off at the wrist. The body was buried and Leon wasset to work pounding salt, presumably to preserve the hands and heart. Montoutesaid he would send him some other stuff to sprinkle over them.When Montoute was arrested shortly after, police found in his house a bloodyrag, two serpents’ skins, five pieces of bone, some sulphur in rock and powderedform, and a phial containing a dark liquid. More to the point, in Montoute’spocket they found a mysterious manuscript in French. When it was producedduring his first appearance before a magistrate, Montoute said it did not ‘containanything of any consequence. It is an old manuscript book of prescriptions whichI carried with me when I went to St. Luce’s house as I was treating him for an olddisease.’ Edgar St Hill’s testimony suggests it was something more than a mere162|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"collection of medical receipts, and was, in fact, the key to the murder. Shortlybefore they slaughtered the boy, Edgar said that Leon ‘asked Montoute whetherhe had read the book again.’ Montoute replied, ‘since I read it this morning I donot require to read again.’The exact purpose of the murder was never fully clarified during the trial. Itwas assumed by the authorities to be some awfulObeahritual. Edgar St Hillprovided conflicting statements. Initially he confessed that Montoute had askedhim to go to Barbados to get two boys that they would sacrifice to the Devil inorder to obtain money from a bank. He later said, however, that he had gone toLeon’s on the night of the murder to help in the cure of Leon’s hernia. This wassomehow to be achieved by Montoute hypnotizing St Hill. On awaking from histrance his two friends pointed to Mapp’s mutilated body lying on the floor andaccused him of having committed the atrocity while under hypnosis. St Hill’smention of a diabolic plan to enrich themselves by getting money from a bank,coupled with the mysterious book owned by Montoute and the severing andpreserving of Mapp’s hands, suggested another alternative: they were seeking tocreate Hands of Glory to render them invisible and so enter the bank unseen.Their inspiration? ThePetit Albertof course. Montoute’s manuscript was appar-ently identified as being a copy of the grimoire during the trial. All three menwere executed.Recent anthropological studies confirm that stories of humansacrifice continue to circulate in the Caribbean. One study of folk religion onMontserrat suggested that if the reports of goats sacrificed on rocks and the ritualmurder of a young girl were to be believed, then such actions ‘seem to beinfluenced by European, Medieval Cabalistic books’.93Thousands of miles away in the Indian Ocean the colonial history was quitedifferent to that in the Caribbean in the sense that there were no native popula-tions. Nevertheless, grimoires took a similar hold on the Creole psyche. TheMascarene Islands of Mauritius,Rodriguez, andRe ́union were uninhabited until apermanent presence was established in the early seventeenth century, consistingmostly of runaway slaves brought there by Dutch and Portuguese traders. It wasthe French, though, who stamped their cultural identity on the islands anddeveloped their economies, taking permanent control overRe ́union in the1640s and Mauritius andRodriguez in the early eighteenth century. African slaveswere brought to Mauritius andRe ́union in significant numbers, followed later byChinese and the more culturally influential Indian immigrants as the East Indiestrade route developed. Although the islands were seceded to the British during theNapoleonic Wars,Re ́union was returned to the French in1815.The history of grimoires highlights the strong French influence on the twoislands that remained under British colonial rule. We can see this in Englishreports from Mauritius during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuriesAcross the Oceans|163"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"expressing concern over the influence of thePetit Albert.In1879the Britishjudiciary on the island dealt with a horrific case of murder that reminds one ofthe St Lucia murder twenty-five years later. It concerned a sorcerer named VirgilePicot, who abducted and mutilated a six-year-old girl apparently to obtain humanflesh for a magical ritual. Picot was thought to be deep in ‘Petit Albert’. This didnot mean he possessed a copy of the grimoire. For the authorities the nameexpressed more than a book; it wasthemagical tradition. A correspondentreported from the island in1884that its ‘professors’ were ‘generally negroeswith a sprinkling of Indians among them, and, although they practise on thelines laid down in ‘‘Petit Albert,’’ not one in20ever saw the book or could read itif laid before them. The precepts it contains are handed down by word of mouth.’He went on to talk of the ‘believers’ in and ‘priests and priestesses of ‘‘PetitAlbert’’ ’ amongst both the poor and wealthy Creole population. In1928theBritish Bishop of Mauritius wrote in theChurch Times, in similar vein, complain-ing of the hold sorcery had over the island: ‘witchcraft or Petit Albert is practisedby many thousands of persons . . . Petit Albert is nothing less than the cult of theDevil.’94By the twentieth century it is fair to say that thePetit Alberthad achievedlegendary status across the archipelagos, even if most inhabitants of the islandshave never seen let alone read it. OnRodriguez Island, for example, it has beenobserved that ‘everybody knowstitalbe`r, without knowing exactly what it is.’95Judging from the corpus of twentieth-century anthropological studies it is inRe ́union, the only one of the islands to remain a French colony, that theGrandandPetit Alberthave had the most enduring influence on magical and medicaltraditions.96One renownedRe ́union healer during the1980s was the son of poorfarmers who, as a young man, learned his calling from frequenting various Indiancults active in the town of Saint-Pierre and reading French esoteric works such astheGrand Albert. He combined these foreign traditions with his knowledge of thehealing properties of local plants and animals.97There has been considerable debate amongst anthropologists of folk medicaltraditions in the Caribbean, the Americas, and the Mascarene Islands about theorigins of the beliefs and practices recorded in the twentieth century. One area ofcontention concerns the humoral conception of human illness. Ancient Greekphysicians believed that health was governed by the balance of four substances,yellow bile, black bile, blood, and phlegm. Illnesses were caused by the imbalanceof these substances, which led to excessive heat/cold, moistness/dryness in thebody. Cures required the ingestion of foods, liquids, or herbs that had hot/cold,wet/dry properties that counteracted the identified imbalance, or methods likebleeding that reduced humoral excesses. It was the writings of the ancient Greekphysician Galen that sealed the orthodoxy of this theory in European medicine164|Across the Oceans"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"right into the eighteenth century. It is still with us in popular notions, such as thatbeing in the ‘cold’ can cause a cold. Similar concepts have been identified inthe various popular medical traditions of the Caribbean and Central and SouthAmerica. Although some have argued that they derive from similar indigenousmedical notions, there is evidence pointing to a European rather than nativeorigin.98We need to be aware, though, that humoral theory is not uniformlycentral to medical beliefs across the region, and other therapeutic principles, such asthose based on spirits, coexist with humoral causation.99Where the Europeaninfluence was strongest it presumably spread slowly but surely over the centuries viahospitals, pharmacies, and missionaries. Galenic medicine was still being taught insome Central and South American universities until the early nineteenth century,long after it had been banished from the curricula of European universities.It was popular access to literature that had the most effect. Manuscriptrecetarios,orhousehold medical receipt books, which borrowed from more august tomes firstprinted in the early modern period, certainly circulated in Mexico during theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries.100The role of grimoires in this process hasbeen little considered, though it has been suggested that humoral theory introducedto Haitian folk medicine by the early French colonialists was revived and perpetuatedthrough the widespread circulation of theGrandandPetit Albertduring the nine-teenth century.101Much of theGrand Albertand the medical content of thePetitAlbert, such as the ‘curious secrets touching the effects of nature’, were clearly basedon humoral theory. The strong grimoire influence on folk medicine is certainlyconfirmed by changing conceptions of medical-magical power. A study of Caribsettlements in Dominica suggested that by1945the indigenous healers, who curedby going on soul flights to intercede with the spirits on behalf of clients, had largelydied out. The role of these healers had been usurped bydivineurswhose power wasbased on skills learned from literature, with theAlbertbooks being the main source ofspells and healing recipes.102Across the Caribbean such book magic was defined as‘science’. As one oldObeahpractitioner from Santa Domingo and the WindwardIslands told a folklorist in the early1970s, the way to invoke the dead to help you wasto go to a cemetery around midnight with ‘a Black Arts book’ and make ‘necroma-ney, making science’.103A practitioner on Montserrat who described himself as a‘scientist’ explained, ‘I have read a lot of books written by occult scientists; we drawsymbols and words from the ancient Egyptians which would cast away or protectfrom the evil influence.’104Working with ‘science’ was dangerous for all but theadept. Those who merely dabbled with the likes of thePetit Albertor theGrimoire duPape Honoriusrisked madness and suicidal impulses. Only thegadedzafehealers of theAntilles could read them because they already possessed ‘the power’ and the naturalgift to access their contents without harm.105Across the Oceans|165"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"IslamIf French grimoires acted as multicultural glue, and were easily adopted by a widevariety of religious and magical traditions, why did they not become influentialin French Africa? The answer lies in the influence of Islamic popular religion. Aswe have seen, magic, divination, prophecy, and astrology had an equivalentinfluence on medieval Arabic literary culture as they did in Christian Europe,and continued to do so into the modern period. Writing in the early twentiethcenturyReginald Campbell Thompson, an expert on ancient Semitic magic,noted from personal experience, that ‘from Morocco to Mesopotamia, books ofmagic are by no means rare, and manuscripts in Arabic, Hebrew, Gershuni, andSyriac can frequently be bought.’106A recently uncovered eighteenth-centuryIranian magic manuscript is an excellent example of the sort of manuals carriedacross the region by wandering fortune-tellers and healers. It consists of a mix ofArabic Koranic talismans and Persian spells. One talisman depicted, for instance,carries the following advice: ‘He, who eats the roasted testicle of a black cat, cannever be satisfied by intercourse, [and] who copies this talisman and binds it to hisright hand, the enemies of him will be cast down.’107The Islamic folk magic tradition continues to thrive in modern print culture aswell. By way of illustration Campbell Thompson mentioned that in the Sudan hewas offered a poorly printed astrological work with rough, worn-out woodcuts.In modern Cairo manuals on how to prepare amulets and talismans, and how todeal withjinnor demons are ‘available in the streets everywhere’.108TheShams al-ma’\u0003arif(Illumination of Knowledge) written in the thirteenth century by Al-B\u0003un\u0003\u0004,which is one of the most enduringly influential Arabic works on talismans, magicsquares, and protective prayers, was being printed in India during the1880s and inCairo around1900, and continues to influence more recent Islamic magic booksin northern and western Africa.109To put this Islamic influence in a colonial context we can turn to the experi-ence of the Mende tribe of Sierra Leone. As in much of West Africa, the firstliterary cultures that impacted significantly on the Mende world view were thosetransmitted by Arabic traders, migrants, and missionaries. This was long before theChristian European influence permeated through the repatriation attempts of theanti-slavery Sierra Leone Company in the1790s, and the region’s subsequentadoption as a British colony. It was the Koran, rather than the Bible or Europeanesoteric traditions, that consequently became most deeply engrained in Mendeconceptions of literary magic.110Mandingo and Fulamarabouts, Islamic holy menand healers, became a major part of the Mende’s magical outlook. A similarsituation existed in other parts of colonial West Africa.

Just like manyEuropean cunning-folk, themaraboutsmade considerable play of their books, andused them to construct Arabic charms consisting of passages from the Koran, ormagic squares and symbols from manuscripts and printed works of medievalorigin. These were considered holy texts, which, when written on slips of paperand kept as amulets, had protective functions against the supernatural.111So, the venerable Islamic tradition of literary magic that infused through tradeand cultural contact, acted as a buffer against the European grimoires madeavailable through colonial rule. While colonial French Africa was largely Islamic,significant areas of British West Africa and the Caribbean were either Christian-ized or beyond the influence of Islamic religious tradition. Though there isevidence of Islamic written charms,alherces, being brought over to the Caribbeanand Latin America during the early modern period and eighteenth century, byeither Muslim slaves or Spaniards, it was the Christian religious monopoly therethat sealed the dominance of the European magic books.112In the absence ofcheap British grimoires, entrepreneurial American publishers would step into themagical breach.Across the Oceans|167"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTERFIVEREDISCOVERINGANCIENTMAGICIn the nineteenth century archaeological revelations about the world of ancientEgypt reinvigorated old conceptions of the country’s place in the history of theoccult and inspired new magical traditions. But it is important to acknowledgethat ancient Egyptian culture was not as remote to the people of early modernEurope as one might think. In learned medical practice pieces of Egyptianmummies were prized for their potent blend of resins, gums, oils, and decayedbodilyXuids.1The Medici popes and prosperous merchants of early sixteenth-century Italy generated an enthusiasm for Egyptian monumental architecture andantiquities as part of a renewed respect for the military achievements of their paganancestors, giving pride of place to the obelisks that had been brought back in theheyday of the Empire.2In intellectual circles hieroglyphs fascinated theRenaissanceoccult philosophers and alchemists. As with the Jewish Kabbalah, hieroglyphsrepresented both the key to and substance of ancient wisdom, and their meaningcould only be revealed through divine communication or by intuitive inspiration.For some they represented a universal code, theWrst language created by God.Travellers and antiquarians examined them atWrst hand on the monumentsofRome or in Egypt itself. Interest was further heightened by the publication ofPyramidographia(1646), theWrst scholarly study of the Giza complex, writtenby John Greaves. During the mid-seventeenth century the number of curiousEuropean visitors to Egypt was suYcient for a French goldsmith named LouisBertier to run a successful cabinet of curiosities in Cairo. At a time when peoplewere being prosecuted and executed for witchcraft and conjuration across Europe,Egypt maintained a reputation as the heartland of magic, the home of Moses the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"magician and Hermes Trismegistus. Greaves could not help remarking that ‘theArabians and moors use much witchcraft in Cairo’.3Hieroglyphs had been depicted in print as early as1505with the publication oftheHieroglyphica, a manuscript detailing the allegorical symbolism of the hiero-glyphs. Like theCorpus Hermeticumit was discovered in the earlyWfteenth century,and it was attributed to an ancient Egyptian priest-magician named Horapollo.4While occult philosophers andRenaissance magicians held hieroglyphics to be anoccult key, other scientists and philosophers saw them in a more mundane light.The philosopher Francis Bacon, writing in1605, dismissed their mystical inter-pretation and determined that the hieroglyphs were far from being the sacred codeof a higher philosophical civilization. They were, he wrote dismissively, theprimitive means of recording the thoughts of a less advanced stage of humansociety.5Still, how could Bacon know? No one could translate them, thoughsome thought they had cracked the secrets they contained. The most notable wasthe Jesuit mathematician, cryptographer, and scientiWc showman AthanaseusKircher (1601–80). He wrote a series of publications on the subject, includingthe monumentalOedipus Aegyptiacus(1654), in which he proudly set out not onlythe meaning of the hieroglyphs but the origin of Egyptian civilization. Hebelieved that the hieroglyphs were the invention of Hermes Trismegistus.While recognizing the simple phonetic andWgurative representative basis ofhieroglyphs, and correctly observing analogies with other ancient writing, Kircherwas led almost entirely down the wrong path due to his adherence to the notionthat they encapsulated a secret symbolic meaning, that they were the language ofdivine communication.The mystical interpretation of the hieroglyphs and their link with Hermeticismwas reinvigorated during the second half of the eighteenth century by theXourishing interest in Freemasonry. Up until this point, Freemasonry was mostlyinspired by the symbolism and mythology of Solomon’s temple, the Kabbalah,and the Knights Templar. The increasing antiquarian interest in Egypt nowentered the mix.6One manifestation of this appeared in the1770s when theFrench Freemason Antoine Court de Gebelin claimed that Tarot card imagesconstituted a symbolic essence of the Book of Thoth, thus encapsulating thewisdom of ancient Egypt. Then there was Count Cagliostro. On a visit to Londonin1777he founded his own branch of Egyptian Freemasonry. While riZingthrough the barrows of a bookseller in Leicester Square, so the dubious story goes,Cagliostro came across a manuscript treatise on the Egyptian origins of Free-masonry written by one George Cofton, a man of whom nothing concrete isknown whether he existed at all. Through the aid of a translator the manuscriptrevealed to Cagliostro that Freemasonry was founded by an Egyptian high priestcalled the Great Copt in the time of the pyramid builders. The essence of thisRediscovering Ancient Magic|169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Egyptian Freemasonry was the goal of human reuniWcation with the divine.Cagliostro now set out to spread the message amongst his fellow Freemasonsacross Europe, preaching that the Great Copt had personally charged him withrestoring the purity of Freemasonry from the devil worshippers and rationalistswho had corrupted it. He took to wearing a black silk robe with red embroideredhieroglyphs while acting out his esoteric rituals.7A few years later, independent ofCagliostro’s Masonic revelation, the Freemason Ignaz Edler von Born, a majorWgure of the Austrian Enlightenment, provided an alternative vision of theimportance of Egyptian religious culture to Freemasonry. Interpreted throughthe prism of early modern Hermeticism, von Born saw the Egyptian priesthood asthe servants of science serving the welfare of the people, rather than as magicianskeeping them in dread thrall or a permanent state of spiritual readiness.8It was only with the discovery in1799of theRosetta Stone, a black granite slabinscribed with a Ptolemaic decree written in Demotic Egyptian, Greek, andhieroglyphs, that translation was made possible. The Stone was found by a Frenchsoldier working in the Egyptian town ofRosetta (Rashid) and was swiftly appro-priated by a general based in Alexandria. When Napoleon heard of its discoveryhe ordered that it be removed to the recently createdInstitut Nationalin Cairo andthat copies of the inscriptions be made and distributed to the scholarly commu-nity. With the surrender of the French to the British in1801theRosetta Stone,along with numerous other major antiquities, was packed oVto London and tookpride of place in the British Museum. Thanks to Napoleon, though, scholars wereable to work on the inscriptions without having to travel to Britain, and withintwo decades several had groped their way to partial understandings of the hiero-glyphs. But, perhapsWttingly, it was a French philologist, Jean Franc ̧oisChampollion (1790–1832), who, with his detailed knowledge of Coptic,Demotic, and Greek, fully cracked the code in the1820s. What his work revealedwas not a mystical language but a sophisticated means of recording the mundanelegal,Wscal, and administrative workings of a sophisticated society—and themagical practices that underpinned its conception of life and the afterlife.The discoveries made by the archaeologists who joined Napoleon’s exped-itionary force to Egypt between1798and1801, and the beautifully illustratedpublications on Egyptian antiquities they produced,Wred the imagination ofEuropean urban society. The exhibits of the British Museum and the Louvrebecame the most enduringly popular part of their collections. A dedicated Egyp-tian Museum was founded in Berlin in1850. Pyramids, temples, and sphinxesinXuenced garden design and architecture. Egyptian features could be seen in thestreets of the European capitals. Londoners marvelled at the temple facade of theEgyptian Hall, built in Piccadilly in1812, and which hosted numerous popularexhibitions of curiosities from across the world. A report in theNew York Heraldin170|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"1881observed that ‘it would be absurd for the people of any great city to hope tobe happy without an Egyptian obelisk.’9Mummies proved hugely popular withpublic unravellings being put on by scientiWc showmen. They joined shroudedghosts as familiar supernatural beings in plays, stage magic, andWction.10The old use of ‘Egyptian’ to mean ‘gypsy’, which had been used in Englishvagrancy laws for centuries, fell out of usage. The gypsies’ reputation for magicwas based partly on the notion that they originated from the magical land ofEgypt, and that some of the old magic of the priests and pharaohs was in theirblood. We have already seen that the German charm chapbookDie EgyptischeGeheimnisse(Egyptian Secrets) proved popular in eighteenth-century Germany.Around the same time several cheap fortune-telling guides in Britain also playedon the tradition. TheNew and true Egyptian fortune-tellerwas, for example,attributed to ‘Ptolomy, King of the Gypsies’. Thanks to ‘Egyptomania’, however,by the1820s ‘Egyptian’ came to mean ‘Egyptian’ in such popular literature.Romany gypsies retained a reputation for magic nevertheless, and with ethno-graphic research relocating their origins to India rather than the Near East newtraditions emerged regarding their mystic Hindu powers.11Having Egyptian as distinct from gypsy associations became an increasinglycommon claim of fortune-tellers, occultists, and the producers of practical occultguides. The most popular of the latter was the dream divination manualNapoleonBonaparte’s Book of Fate, which as the title suggests, was said to have been used bythe French Emperor. Most versions of this claimed that it was a German transla-tion of an ancient Egyptian manuscript found in an Egyptian royal tomb in1801by one M. Sonnini—a reference probably to the French traveller and historianCharles S. Sonnini, whose bookTravels in Upper and Lower Egyptwas published in1800.12TheWrst edition of the French grimoireLa poule noire, printed in1820,also reXected the occult zeitgeist. It described how the magical instructions itcontained derived from a French soldier in Egypt who was rescued from an Arabattack by an old Turk who hid him inside a pyramid. The old man instructed himin the secrets of ancient magic from manuscripts that survived the burning ofPtolemy’s library. The same story was repeated in anotherBibliothe`que bleuegrimoire that appeared a few years later entitledThe Old Man of the Pyramids.The new vogue for Egyptian association went down particularly well inAmerica where the old European traditions regarding gypsies had less relevance.CharlesRoback, a notorious mid-nineteenth-century American quack and cun-ning-man, claimed he visited Cairo and the pyramids, then followed the Nile toits source. ‘I made myself familiar with all that could be elicited from the modernEgyptians, respecting the incantations and prodigies performed by the priests ofancient Egypt,’ he boasted. In a village near ancient Thebes he said he collectedseveral astrological papyrus rolls written in cuneiform that served him well in hisRediscovering Ancient Magic|171"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"future career.13A survey of late-nineteenth-century American fortune-tellingadvertisements revealed that many diviners claimed to have Egyptian ancestry.‘The Great Egyptian Prophetess, Sentinella Guzhdo’, who circulated leaXets inNew Jersey, claimed her parents were born near Cairo and that she was ‘a linealdescendant of Zindello, king of one of the most ancient tribes of Egypt’. Herability to ‘remove spells, and cure diseases’ was due to charms carefully preservedby her tribe.14It was only from the late1820s onwards that the magic books of the Egyptianswere decoded for theWrst time. The most importantWnd occurred shortly before1828when Egyptians digging for grave goods near Thebes found a cache ofmagical papyri rolls written in Greek, Demotic, and Coptic. It is worth noting atthis point that from the late medieval period onwards, Egyptian treasure huntershad used Arabic grimoires in order to conjure up treasures and deal with the djinnsand other spirits that guarded them. The most widely used text wasThe Book ofBuried Pearls, dated to theWfteenth century, which, like theLibro de San CiprianoinSpain and Portugal, combined geographical details of sites where treasures layburied with the magical means of obtaining them. Cheap Arabic and Frenchversions were published in Cairo in1907on the instructions of Gaston Maspero,Director of Antiquities in Egypt. Maspero and the editor of the publication, thearchaeologist Ahmed Bey Kamal, believed theBook of Buried Pearlshad causedmore destruction to ancient monuments than war and the ravages of time. Theyhoped that making such ‘secret’ knowledge more widely available would helpdispel the book’s aura and undermine its pernicious inXuence. It was probably avain hope. Writing in the1930s a former British Chief Inspector of Antiquities forMiddle Egypt noted that the book continued to be much studied by treasureseekers. To give a taste of the advice it contained, here are instructions forWndingtreasure near the pyramid of Cheops:Make a fumigation with tar, styrax, and wool from a black sheep, and adoor giving access to a dyke enclosing four feddans will be opened to you.Make then your fumigation and jump across the dyke, then dig into theenclosed area, and you willWnd, at one cubit’s depth or a little more,some nuggets of gold. Take all you desire, continuing the fumigationuntil you haveWnished.As a footnote, in the1920s the search for the ‘lost’ or legendary oasis and city ofZerzura, supposedly situated in the Egyptian portion of the Libyan Desert, was givenfresh impetus by the discovery of a reference to it in theBook of Buried Pearls.15The sensationalWnds at Thebes, which would come to be known as theTheban magical library, were swiftly sold to Giovanni Anastasi, the Swedishconsul in Alexandria.16This interesting character has a rather obscure background172|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"with various conXicting accounts of his origins. One suggestion is that he wasArmenian by birth, and arrived in Egypt around1797with his father, a trader whosupplied the French troops. What is certain is that Anastasi became a wealthymerchant and prospered in the antiquities trade. He broke up the Theban magicallibrary selling parts of it to museums in Leiden and Stockholm, as well as to theBritish Museum. Other signiWcant discoveries appeared over the next few dec-ades, but nothing matching the Theban library in scope and quantity. It is likelythat some of these later magical papyri, such as several rolls purchased fromAnastasi by the Louvre, were probably part of the cache found in1828but it isimpossible to prove conclusively.Now the slow process of translation began. In1830the Dutch scholar CasparJacob ChristiaanReuvens published excerpts of the Leiden rolls, and a few yearslater a German translation of these appeared. Over in Britain, in1853, one of thepapyri held by the British Museum was translated into English with a commentaryby Charles WycliVe Goodwin. It was the Viennese papyri expert Carl Wessely(1860–1931) who did most to make knowledge of the Graeco-Egyptian grimoiresaccessible. In the late1880s he produced transcriptions of the Paris and Londonrolls, while an edition of the British Museum’s magical papyri was publishedindependently by Frederick George Kenyon.Meanwhile cuneiform, the earliest form of writing used by Middle Easterncivilizations such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Akkadians, was also beingdeciphered, though with much less fanfare and public interest. German andBritish scholars were at the forefront of cracking the meaning of the cuneiformpictographs, but it was a Frenchman, Franc ̧ois Lenormant (1837–83), the son of awell-respected archaeologist who had accompanied Champollion on an exped-ition to Egypt, who brought translations of this earliest written magic to the widerpublic.17Lenormant made his reputation working on the archaeology of southernItaly but he was also an authority on Near Eastern civilizations, though hisreputation suVered from accusations of forgery. It was his workLa Magie chezles Chalde ́ennes(1874) that added a new dimension to Western understanding ofancient written magic. The book was based around what were known as the EvilSpirit Texts, Assyrian–Babylonian cuneiform tablets containing spells and exor-cisms to ward oVdevils, ghosts, and other malign inXuences such as plague. A fewyears later English and German editions appeared, both of which went on to berepublished numerous times and can still be found in the Mind, Body, and Spiritsections of major bookshops.Despite all the academic interest in ancient civilizations—a professorial chair inEgyptology was created at Berlin University as early as1846—the scholarlycommunity was not exactly consumed by curiosity regarding the secrets of themagical papyri.18In fact the history of magic was not considered worthy of muchRediscovering Ancient Magic|173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"serious attention at all. When, in1875, Maspero produced an edition of a Demoticmagical papyrus he felt it necessary to excuse the publication of these ‘magicalformulae without much interest for science’. He was trying to deXect suchcriticism as that uttered by the scholar who complained that the magical papyri‘deprived antiquity of the noble splendour of classicism’.19In his review ofKenyon’sGreek Papyri in the British Museum(1893), the Cambridge lecturerJ.Rendel Harris observed regarding the magic rolls, ‘To most people these arevery void of attraction. The recipes for raising spirits or for seeing one’s owndouble, side by side with plans for detecting thieves and for the expulsion ofvermin, are in themselves stupid enough.’ He went on to argue though, that ‘weought not neglect them simply because weWnd them made up largely of Coptic,Hebrew and Syriac Abracadabra.’ Magic, he concluded, was too near religion tobe neglected by scholars.20This message may not have attracted widespread sympathy amongst archae-ologists and biblical scholars, but new academic disciplines that embraced it weredeveloping. Anthropology and the History ofReligions were gaining respect. Bythe end of the century professorial chairs in the History ofReligion were createdin universities across Europe and in America, and dedicated journals appeared inGerman and French. As an overview of the subject written in1926commented,‘It was the sign of a new spirit, a thrust towards objectivity, an eVort to escape thehampering hand of apologetics.’21At the heart of both disciplines in their earlyyears was the comparison of religious beliefs from across the globe in the search forsimilarities that could reveal the cultural and mental evolution of humankind.Thanks to the archaeologists and cryptologists, the genesis of ancient religions andtheir relationship to magic could be pushed back beyond ancient Greece. Anotherinterested group who had a particular interest in this, and in tracing the possiblesurvival of ancient magic into the present, were those participants in what isknown as the OccultRevival of the second half of the nineteenth century.Another magical renaissanceAs we have already seen, despite the so-called Enlightenment the practice ofmagic never disappeared in Europe, manifesting itself in the activities of treasureseekers and cunning-folk, and in the rareWed esoteric religious and Freemasonrymovements of the eighteenth century. During the early nineteenth century newpseudo-sciences such as mesmerism renewed intellectual interest in universalhidden forces. It was spiritualism, though, that truly galvanized public interest inthe occult and provided a magnetic focal point for the swirl of disparate esotericgroups and ideas circulating in educated society.174|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"From the simple ‘yes’/‘no’ table-rapping sessions with the souls of the dead inthe late1840s and1850s, spiritualism developed in surprising directions, from thequest to capture images of the spirit world using that new-fangled device, thecamera, to the later formation of its own organized religion. Spiritualism had itsmystical, esoteric angles as well, and Egyptology entered the mix, with theadoption of Egyptian iconography by clairvoyants and in the reformulation ofthe old conceptions of a universal spiritual truth. The journalist and poet GeraldMassey (1828–1907) is worthy of note in this respect. A working-class lad fromHertfordshire, Massey was a Christian Socialist who found in spiritualism andancient Egypt the key to understanding modern man.22He wrote a series of bookson the origins and legacy of Egyptian civilization in which he came up with someextraordinary claims. He was convinced, for example, that theWve books ofMoses were Egyptian astronomical allegories. Adopting the comparative approachof early anthropology he believed he had found linguistic and cultural traceslinking the British Celts with ancient Egypt and Africa. During the1870s and1880s he conducted several lecture tours in North America and Canada explaininghis spiritualist and cultural theories to audiences already primed by similar home-grown ideas, such as those of the Congressman Ignatius Donnelly. In a best-sellingbook published in1882he posited that ancient Egypt and the Americas were bothpart of the world of pre-Flood or antediluvian Atlantis, as proven by the existenceof pyramids and obelisks in both regions.23The Theosophical Society, founded in1875, was the most inXuential occultmovement to form out of the spiritualist social ether. At one time or another mostoccultists of the era either joined the Society or engaged with the writings of itscharismatic co-founder, the well-travelledRussian e ́migre ́Helena PetrovnaBlavatsky (1831–91). In her early career as a seeker of secret universal wisdomBlavatsky had been much inXuenced byRosicrucianism and Kabbalah, but by thetime the Theosophical Society was founded the focus of her spiritual tenets hadshifted eastwards to India and Tibet. It was there, she claimed, resided themahatmas or ancient holy men, adepts in the mysteries of the world, withwhom she maintained a direct psychic contact. It was they who dictated to herthe founding text of Theosophy,Isis Unveiled.24But what of the role of magic in this occult revival? Over and over again whenreading through the voluminous and often turgid library of occult expositionsproduced during the second half of the nineteenth century, oneWnds one namerecurring over and over again: E ́liphas Le ́vi. This was the Hebrew pseudonym ofthe son of a poor Parisian shoemaker named Alphonse Louis Constant (1810–75).25Le ́vi trained to be a Catholic priest but left the seminary shortly before hisordination, explaining later in life that he could not take his vows ‘before thealtar of a cold and egotistical cult’. He never lost his Catholic faith however, just hisRediscovering Ancient Magic|175"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"respect for the Church. Following his mother’s suicide, Le ́vi, now scraping a livingfrom teaching, found his way into the mystical, political, and prophetic milieu ofbackstreet Paris. He became a voracious reader of old and new occult works, and avisitor to theBibliothe`que de l’Arsenal. TheWrst of his books on magic,Dogme etritual de la haute magie(1856), reveals a familiar set of inXuences. Kabbalah and theTarot underpin his conception of magic, though mixed with these weWnd themore recent theories of mesmerism and animal magnetism, with Le ́vi describinghow the aim of the magician was to control the astralXuidic forces that he believedinfused the Universe. He loathed black magic, the conjuration of devils and thespirits of the dead, describing its practice and its manuals as ‘an epidemic ofunreason’.26It was a view echoed by the generation of magicians he inXuenced.Le ́vi said he had studied numerous grimoires over many years and had come tothe conclusion that the only useful ones were all in manuscript and requireddeciphering using the codes formulated by Trithemius; ‘the importance ofothers consists wholly in the hieroglyphs and symbols which adorn them.’27TheClavicule of Solomonwas evidently one of the few legitimate grimoires in hisestimation, for in1860he made an annotated manuscript copy of one version,perhaps from a text in theBibliothe`que de l’Arsenal.28He knew well theBibliothe`quebleuegrimoires, dismissing them as ‘catch-penny mystiWcations and impostures ofdishonest publishers’. In a discussion on love philtres he declined to provide anyexamples from thePetit Albert, a book he described as common in the countryside,remarking that its spells were ‘either foolish or criminal’. Of theGrand grimoireand its instructions for calling up the dead, he wrote, ‘No doubt anyone who ismad enough and wicked enough to abandon himself to such operations ispredisposed to all chimeras and all phantoms. Hence the recipe in theGrandGrimoireis most eYcacious, but we advise none of our readers to have recourse toit.’29As a conscientious Catholic he had further reason to denounce grimoiressuch as theGrimoire du Pape Honoriusfor they besmirched the pious reputations ofthe saints and popes. Only the Devil could proWt from such pernicious mischiefmaking.30The only good he couldWnd in theBibliothe`que bleuegenre were theParacelsian lamens and receipts that the compiler of thePetit Alberthad included.Le ́vi had great respect for old Theophrastus Bombatus von Hohenheim. He oncefell asleep over a copy of one of his works and experienced a vision of meetingwith him in his alchemical laboratory. On waking he rationalized the experience,but this dream encounter with Paracelsus nevertheless left a strong and lastingimpression on him.31Le ́vi hoped his writings on magic would combat and expose black magic anddiabolic grimoires, those ‘unhappy aberrations of the human mind’.32As evidenceof their pernicious contents, he referred to the experiments on the occult power ofsymbols by the mesmerist Jean Du Potet de Sennevoy (1796–1891). These176|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"involved exposing people to a series of lines and symbols, including circles, stars,and serpent shapes, drawn on theXoor in chalk and charcoal. Le ́vi described themas being analogous, ‘if not absolutely identical, with pretended diabolical signa-tures found in old editions of the Grand Grimoire’.33The idea was that certaincombinations of signs and lines exuded a magnetic inXuence over people, andcould even induce a profound sense of fear and cause the mind to conjure upfrightening visions.34For Le ́vi the evil hold that malign grimoires could have overthe weak or unstable was brought home to him by his encounter with a youngpriest who inquired of a bookseller where the master of magic lived. An appoint-ment was arranged and the priest said he desired to obtain theGrimoire of Honoriusand would pay as much as one hundred francs for it. When Le ́vi queried whetherhe intended to practise forbidden black magic, the priest merely smiled sarcastic-ally. It transpired later that the priest was Jean-Louis Verger, a troublesome andmentally unstable young man who, in1857, murdered the archbishop of Parisduring service.35Le ́vi made two well-received visits to England in1854and1856, where hismain contact was with the novelist, politician, and student of the occult EdwardBulwer-Lytton (1803–73), whom later magic groups would falsely claim as a highproWle member.36By1860Le ́vi’s works had proven so inXuential that he wasreceiving admiring visitors from abroad. One of them was the writer, magazineeditor, and mason Kenneth Mackenzie. His place in the history of modernoccultism is partly due to an account he published of his visit to Le ́vi’s home,but primarily because of his early membership of the SocietasRosicruciana inAnglia, which was founded in1865by its Supreme Magus, the FreemasonRobertWentworth Little.37Other members were a London coroner named WilliamWynn Westcott, who we shall meet again a little later, and Frederick Hockley(1808–85). The latter was a last link with the turn-of-the-century London occultnetwork that circled around John Denley’s bookshop. Hockley was at one timeemployed by Denley, transcribing and compiling expensive and cheap grimoiresfor sale, and his own collection of magical manuscripts was much coveted.38Another foreign traveller passing through the London occult scene around thistime was the African-American spiritualist BeverlyRandolph (1825–75).39Bornin the New York slums and brought up in an almshouse where his mother died,he signed up as a cabin boy to escape life on the streets. Despite the challenges ofhis miserable youth he managed to teach himself to read and write. He set himselfup as a barber in Utica and began to make a name for himself as an antislaveryorator and as a clairvoyant physician and spiritualist, adopting the title of ‘Dr’.Randolph visited England in1855and1857, circulating amongst the feverishspiritualist community but also, according to his own account, meeting Bulwer-Lytton and theRosicrucian writer Hargrave Jennings. There is no reason to doubtRediscovering Ancient Magic|177"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"this. Bulwer-Lytton’sWction was certainly the inspiration forRandolph’s ownattempts at writingRosicrucian novels. There is also little doubt that his interestin sex magic was stimulated by Jennings curious works on phallic-BuddhistRosicrucianism.40Randolph’s life-long fascination with scrying and magic mirrors was also due tohis experiences in Paris and London. At the time, experimenting with contactingthe spirit world through crystal balls and magic mirrors was a major preoccupationof mesmerists, spiritualists, and occultists. In the English occult scene instructionson how to prepare and use magic mirrors were available in Barrett’sThe Magus.Frederick Hockley had posed thousands of questions to the angels via his crystal,and around the same timeRichard James Morrison, better known as the author ofZadkiel’s Almanac, was also busy with his ball. In1863he took the bold stepof suing an admiral who had written a letter to theDaily Telegraphaccusing him offraudulent pretences in his scrying sessions. Meanwhile in Paris,Randolph hadletters of introduction to meet Du Potet and another prominent spiritualist anddabbler in magic mirrors Louis-Alphonse Cahagnet. Fanciful stories have circu-lated aboutRandolph being initiated by Le ́vi, but there is absolutely no evidencefor it.41It was the inXuence of Du Potet’s and Cahagnet’s experiments withnarcotics to induce trance states that ledRandolph to become an enthusiastic userof hashish, and at one time he was probably the biggest importer of the drug intothe United States.42Back in America,Randolph renounced spiritualism and entered the mysticalphase of his life. He set up theWrstRosicrucian order in the USA, the FraternitasRosae Crucis, espousing, teaching, and writing about magic mirrors, free love,and the use of sex to reach magical enlightenment. ForRandolph the ritualized useof the orgasm could provide a gateway to the universal mystery of life, giving anew meaning to the magic wand. He set sail once more for Africa and the NearEast in the early1860s in order to complete his mystical enlightenment, thoughdetails of his journey there are suspiciously sketchy, as were those of a previousvisit to the region in the1850s. Whatever the facts, it was certainly important to beknown to have made a pilgrimage to the pyramids, the home ofRosicrucianism.‘During my travels through Africa, Egypt, Turkey, Arabia, Syria, and my inter-course with the Voudeaux of New Orleans and Long Island, I became thoroughlyconvinced of the existence of two kinds of magic,’ he wrote. ‘One good andbeneWcent, ruled and governed by the Adonim, the other foul, malevolent,revengeful, lustful, and malignant.’43Randolph’s signiWcance in the story of grimoires lies in the interest he gener-ated in ritual magic in America and the demand he might have created for booksof magic.Randolph certainly made money importing and selling magic mirrorsand it is not unlikely that he was involved in selling books other than his own.178|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"This was certainly the case with an occult group founded in the USA a few yearsafterRandolph’s death that was inXuenced by the sex magic and mirror rituals hetaught. The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor was a mail order organizationfounded in1884by Peter Davidson (1837–1915), a Scottish violinmaker.44Davidson claimed the Brotherhood originated in Egypt long before the time ofHermes Trismegistus, and stressed to initiates that it was a Western order asdistinct from the Eastern esotericism of the Theosophists. While living in theHighlands of Scotland Davidson had maintained a regular correspondence withthe London occult scene, including members of the SocietasRosicruciana inAnglia and Hargrave Jennings. It was this experience of postal fraternity thatgave him the idea that a mail order Order was feasible. After arriving in Americain1886to set up a utopian community, he successfully continued to orchestratethe running of the Brotherhood’s predominantly British and French members.The utopian community never materialized though, and Davidson scraped aliving as a herbal doctor and supplier of magic mirrors, crystals, and books fromhis home in Loudsville, Georgia. In a letter dated1886a prospective member ofthe Brotherhood enquired of Davidson about purchasing a copy of Barrett’sMagus. Davidson replied that it was selling for £1.5s.6d. He also said, ‘I can getyou Agrippa’s4Books if you wish. I have not them in stock just now; they arerather diYcult to be had now as they are getting very scarce.’45The Brotherhood’s initial representative in England was theRevd WilliamAlexander Ayton, the vicar of Chacombe, Northamptonshire, who whennot carrying out his pastoral duties pursued his interest in Freemasonry andTheosophy.46His consuming passion was alchemical experimentation, and hewhiled away many hours in his laboratory hidden away in his cellar under therectory. Ayton provides a neat link to the two men who more than anyone duringthe OccultRevival opened up the secrets of the grimoires for an English readershipwho could not access the German editions of Horst and Scheible. Aytonconducted the marriage ceremony of theWrst of the two, Samuel Liddell Mathers(1854–1918).It was while living with his widowed mother in the seaside town of Bourne-mouth that Mathers, the son of a Hackney merchant’s clerk, befriended a neigh-bour and Freemason named Frederick Holland.47His exploration of esotericismbegan, and in1882the pair were admitted to the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia.As his social circle widened the Hackney boy began to craft a new persona forhimself. His love of all things military nearly matched his fascination with theoccult. He joined a volunteer regiment and enthusiastically participated in crowdcontrol duties. More surprising was his adoption of the Scottish title CountMacGregor of Glenstrae, bogusly claiming that Louis XV had bestowed it on anancestor after the Jacobite rebellion. After his mother’s death in1885MathersRediscovering Ancient Magic|179"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"moved to London and it was there that he began to publish theWrst of his bookson occultism and magic. In1888he produced theQabbalah Unveiled, a translationof a seventeenth-century Latin treatise, and a book on the Tarot. The followingyear he sealed his place in the history of grimoires by putting together theWrstEnglish print edition of theKeyorClavicule of Solomon.As has already been noted in an earlier chapter, there were myriad versions ofmanuscript grimoires bearing the title of theClavicule of Solomon. Mathers was wellaware of this, mentioning that he had seen grimoires ascribed to Solomon whichwere ‘full of evil magic, and I cannot caution the practical student too stronglyagainst them.’ So he pored over and transcribed passages from a number of mostlyseventeenth-century manuscripts in French, Hebrew, Latin, and English in theBritish Library,Wltering out the contaminating elements of diabolic magic andconstructing what he considered a pure version of theClavicule. This wouldencapsulate the wisdom of the ancients and serve as a companion to Le ́vi’stheoretical construction of practical magic.In1890Mathers was employed as curator of the then private HornimanMuseum, though today it is a fascinating public museum of cultural and naturalhistory. He obtained the position thanks to the inXuence of the occultist AnnieHorniman, the daughter of the museum’s founder and benefactor. When, fouryears later, Mathers and his French-born wife moved to Paris, Annie continued topay them an allowance, but when this ceased he eked out a living selling TurkishRailway shares to supplement his income from writing. During his time in Paris heconsulted the grimoire collection ofRene ́de Voyer d’Argenson in theBibliothe`quede l’Arsenaland was particularly struck by one entitled theBook of the Sacred Magicof Abra-Melin, which was written in a French hand of the late seventeenth or earlyeighteenth century. It was quite possibly one of those conWscated by the Parispolice in their campaign against the magicians. Mathers explained in the preface tohis1898edition of the manuscript that he had been informed of its existence manyyears earlier. He believed Bulwer-Lytton and Le ́vi knew of it, but it was the poetPaul Bois who urged him to immerse himself in its wisdom.48Like numerous other manuscript grimoires of the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies it provided its own founding myth, telling how it was a translation fromthe Hebrew script of a mage and celebrated Kaballist called Abra-Melin. Accord-ing to the manuscript he was born in1362and had written down the secrets of hismagical knowledge in1458as a means of passing on the wisdom to his son.During his life he had travelled far and wide in search of knowledge, performing atthe courts of European nobles, including that of the English King Henry VI,eventually settled in Wu ̈rzburg. He was, then, an archetype of the JewishRenaissance mage. Mathers was ready to believe in this story and thus seal theimportance of theSacred Magic of Abra-Melinas a profound work on the ascetic,180|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"spiritual basis of ancient Kaballistic magic largely free of the contamination andmeddling that had marred many of the versions of theClavicule of Solomon.49Neither of Mathers’ published grimoires made much money or circulated muchbeyond the small circle of practising occultists in London and Paris. They wereproduced in limited print runs and within a couple of decades they were runningat a high price in the second-hand book market.Arthur Edward Waite (1857–1942) was a more successful and widely appreci-ated author.50Born in New York, the illegitimate son of a merchant marine whodrowned a year after his birth, Waite was taken to England by his mother,an educated middle-class English woman, where he was brought up in northLondon. His only formal education was two terms at St Charles’s College in theLondon suburb of Bayswater, which makes his later literary career all the moreimpressive. Unlike most of the inXuential male occultists of the late Victorianperiod his path to esotericism did not begin with Freemasonry. It was hisCatholicism and fascination with ritual that brieXy led him to consider joiningthe priesthood, and which subsequently, in the early1880s, drew him to the workof Blavatsky and through her to Le ́vi, whose works he would later translate andcomment on critically for an English audience. His other love, poetry, was hardlybringing in a living wage for his wife and young daughter so he turned tochurning out occult studies of varying quality. He did not even put his name tothe hackworkHandbook of Cartomancy. In contrast, hisDevil Worship in France(1896), an expose ́of supposed Satanists, was praised in the academic journalTheAmerican Anthropologistas an ‘invaluable’ work for serious students of occultismand mysticism.51His most unusual publishing venture was the translation ofvarious alchemical writings, including those of Paracelsus, which wasWnancedby the aristocratic alchemist Fitzherbert Edward StaVord-Jerningham (1833–1913), who frittered away his family fortune in the deluded attempt to makegold.52Looking back on this ‘Hermetic adventure’ Waite pondered, ‘it can onlybe regarded as a remarkable bibliographic fact that such texts were issued, and onso great a scale, in the last decade of the nineteenth century.’53Waite’s most successful venture was a Tarot pack published in1910, but thepublication of most interest to us is hisBook of Black Magic and of Pacts(1898).54This was theWrst major history and exposition of the whole genre of grimoires,providing bibliographies and extracts from the range of works I have discussed sofar, such as theArbatel, theClavicules of Solomon,Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy,theGrand grimoire,Book of Honorius, and thePoule noire. Waite’s motivation—apartfrom money—was the same as the likes ofReginald Scot and Georg Conrad Horstin that he set before readers a cornucopia of practical magic for the explicitpurpose of undermining it. Despite his occult interests Waite was no practicalmagician, and his view on the subject is summoned up in his comment that ‘theRediscovering Ancient Magic|181"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"distinction between White and Black Magic is the distinction between the idleand the evil word.’ Waite was well aware, of course, that its contents would be ofhuge interest to practical occultists and pointedly stated that he intended toprovide them with ‘the fullest evidence of the futility of Ceremonial Magic as itis found in books’. The conjurations and spells they contained were ‘ridiculous’,‘absurd’, ‘iniquitous’ even—if ‘it could be supposed that they were to be seriouslyunderstood.’55No surprise then, that Waite made some withering commentsregarding Mathers’ publications. Without naming him directly, he referred to theeditor of theKey of Solomonas ‘an expositor of the more arid and unproWtable sideof Kabalistic doctrine’. He went on to demolish Mathers’ view that theSacredMagic of Abra-Melinwas copied from a Hebrew text or that it even originated anyearlier than the seventeenth century. I have to agree with him.56With its170woodblock engravings of lamens, talismans, signs, and seals, itsnumerous transcriptions of conjurations, exorcisms, and prayers, theBook of BlackMagic and of Pactsconstituted the richest, most comprehensive grimoire everproduced in one printed volume. Waite stripped the great grimoires of theirphilosophical and mystical content and provided a condensed manual of practicalritual magic. Only500copies were printed initially, selling for the considerablesum of £22s. Although Waite obviously hoped to make money from the book, itwas certainly not an exercise in popular publishing, though a new edition for thecheaper price of15s. appeared in1910under the titleThe Book of Ceremonial Magic.Considering their antipathy towards each other and their respective views onmagic, it may seem strange that Mathers and Waite were fellow members of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which was theWrst nineteenth-centuryoccult organization explicitly dedicated to the practice of ritual magic.57Foundedin1888, it had direct links with the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia and most of itsmembers had been immersed in the Theosophy movement. Following thecreation of the initial Isis-Urania Temple of the Golden Dawn in London,regional branches were set up: the Osiris Temple in Weston-super-Mare, theHorus Temple in Bradford, and the Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh. Their magicwas obviously not that of the cunning-folk who continued to provide magicalsolutions for the misfortunes of the general populace of Britain at the time. TheGolden Dawn’s magical philosophy was essentially another reformulation of earlymodern Hermeticism,Rosicrucianism, and Kabbalah, particularly as viewedthrough the lens of Le ́vi’s work. Added to this was a hierarchical structureborrowed from Freemasonry and a ritual basis inXuenced by the old and newEgyptology. The Golden Dawn never consisted of more than a few hundredmembers at its peak, nearly all from the middle classes, but it was notable forwelcoming women and attracting members of the artistic community such as theactress Florence Farr and the Irish poet and mystic W. B. Yeats.182|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Mathers was largely responsible for creating the Golden Dawn’s rituals, withsome initial input from his fellow founding member William Wynn Westcott,who continued to be active in the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia, becoming its‘Supreme Magus’ in the1890s. There was, of course, a foundation text with theusual dubious history. In one version of its discovery this cipher manuscript wasfound in a London bookshop just like Cagliastro happened upon his EgyptianMasonic revelation. The alternative story is that it was owned by FrederickHockley. When he died in1885it was passed on with other papers to theclergyman A. F. A. Woodford, another founder of the Golden Dawn. He, inturn, handed it to Westcott who, recognizing the cipher as one described byTrithemius, set about decoding it. It turned out to consist ofWve otherwiseunknown rituals of aRosicrucian Freemasonic nature. It also contained theaddress of one Anna Sprengel, aRosicrucian adept in Nuremberg whose orderhad a direct line of descent from the medieval brotherhood. Westcott wrote to herand received her authorization to set up a Temple of the Golden Dawn. As can beimagined, this account has been called into doubt. In fact, in1900, Mathers wrotea letter to Florence Farr stating that Westcott had forged both the cipher manu-script and the correspondence with the mysterious Anna Sprengel.58As the rituals of the Golden Dawn developed, incorporating elements of JohnDee’s system of magic, and to a lesser extent Mathers’ grimoire publications,Egyptian pagan inXuences also seeped in.59This is not surprising considering thatMathers once described himself as ‘a student of Occultism, Archaeology, andEgyptology’.60By the1890s the rolls of the Theban Magical Library and otherpapyri had been published, and Lenormant’s work on Chaldean magic texts waswidely known. Mathers referred to it in his introduction to theSacred Magic ofAbra-Melin. So it is not surprising that along with the oldRenaissance notions ofancient Egypt that permeated Hermeticism andRosicrucianism, the nineteenth-century archaeological discoveries of actual Egyptian magic also inXuenced thepractices and rituals of the Golden Dawn. In1896Florence Farr produced a shortbook entitledEgyptian Magicfor which she consulted Goodwin’s work on theGraeco-Egyptian magical papyri, and mentioned in a letter that she had met withan ‘Egyptian Adept in the British Museum’ which had opened up ‘possibilities’.Mathers also taught one of the invocations translated in Goodwin’s article to othermembers of the Order.61The numerous popular publications by Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge (1857–1934)were the most signiWcant inXuence in exciting practical interest in Egyptianmagic.62Budge, who was possibly the ‘Egyptian Adept’ mentioned by FlorenceFarr—though there is no evidence he was an occultist—began studying ancientlanguages while a youthful employee at W. H. Smith’s, and encouraged by thekeeper of oriental antiquities at the British Museum went on to study SemiticRediscovering Ancient Magic|183"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"languages at Cambridge. On graduating he joined the Department of OrientalAntiquities at the British Museum where he remained the rest of his working life.He paid numerous short visits to Egypt, purchasing antiquities from local dealersand a limited number through excavation. He was particularly successful, thoughnot always scrupulous, at collecting papyri and inscribed clay tablets from acrossthe Near and Middle East. Over his lifetime he wrote over a hundred mono-graphs, the most well known of which wereEgyptian Magic(1899) and theBook ofthe Dead(1901). The latter, which developed from a facsimile of thePapyrus of Anipublished by the British Museum in1890, was a funerary text consisting of a seriesof prayers and rituals to guide the dead into the afterlife. Elements of it wereincorporated into the Golden Dawn’s tenets. Its wider public reach was furtheredby reference to it in early-twentieth-century fantasyWction, such as in SaxRohmer’sBrood of the Witch-Queen(1918) and in the casebooks of AlgernonBlackwood’s occult detectiveJohn Silence(1908). Budge’s work is no longertreated seriously by Egyptologists, though, as he wrote quickly and often withoutappropriate scholarly caution or rigour. Numerous mistakes in translation andinterpretation littered his work. Nevertheless, with the expiry of the copyright onhis books, they are still probably the most widely disseminated and used works onthe subject today.Much of the contents of the magical papyri were concerned with spells,exorcisms, and conjurations for the usual practical ends, to heal the possessed,protect against evil, provoke love, and cure the sick. The magic of Le ́vi and theGolden Dawn, like theRenaissance occult philosophers they revered, was con-cerned with the much more lofty desire for spiritual enlightenment. So to makeuse of the magical papyri it was necessary to incorporate them into a ritualreligious framework that transformed them from the practical into the mystical.This was essentially a reversal of the process by which cunning-folk took therituals, symbols, and words of high magic and reformulated them into elements ofpopular magic. It was this mutability of the contents of grimoires that ensuredtheir enduring relevance across diVerent continents and eras.In1903a long-brewing schism occurred in the Golden Dawn, brought aboutprimarily by Mathers’ arrogance and erratic and dictatorial behaviour. Waite, bynow earning a living as a manager for the malted milk drink company Horlicks,took over eVective control of the London Temple, nudging the group’s occultphilosophy and ceremonies away from ancient paganism and towards Christianmysticism. One source of contention had been Mathers’ support for a new andrapidly rising member named Aleister Crowley, whose interest in magic had beenpiqued by reading Waite’sBook of Black Magic.63Crowley would go on to becomethe most notorious magician of the twentieth century. A cruel, egotistical sexmagician who believed he was the reincarnation of Cagliostro and Le ́vi, he was184|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"dubbed the ‘wickedest man in the world’ by the tabloid press, but died quietly andalone in a Hastings boarding house in1947with less than a pound to his name.The story of his rise and fall is a fascinating one, but his presence in the pages of thisbook is due to an act of treachery. In1904relations between Crowley and hispatron had turned sour with Crowley suspecting that Mathers was using blackmagic against him. In turn he consecrated talismans to protect himself. As an act ofrevenge, he published under his own name a British Library manuscript, the‘Lemegeton; Clavicula Salomonis or the Little Key of Solomon’, which consistedof a list of spirits and their characters, that Mathers had transcribed.64A few yearslater Crowley also published the rituals of the Golden Dawn in an occult journalhe had founded, despite Mathers’ legal attempts to stop him. The ‘secrets’ of theGolden Dawn were now out in the open, allowing later historians to piecetogether the various old and new occult sources from which Mathers andWestcott had stitched together the Order’s ritual magic.Writing for the peopleMuch of this chapter has been concerned with the world of, at the most, a fewthousand occultists across Europe and America. It could be argued that theyconstitute a mere footnote in the story of grimoires. But while histories of theOccultRevival focus almost exclusively on the esoteric philosophies, personalrelations, and internal tensions of the occultists, certain products of theRevivalreached far beyond the parlours of Paris and London and away from the esotericbyways of the intellectual fringes of nineteenth-century Western society. One ofPeter Davidson’s guides to the healing power of herbs and their mystical proper-ties,Man Know Thyself(1878), was, for instance, used by folk healers in Trinidad.Behold the Sign: Ancient Symbolism, a small book published by the Ancient MysticalOrderRosæ Crucis (AMORC), founded in the USA in1915, was adopted bysomeObeah-men in Guyana. It contained hieroglyphs and symbols, such as aWve-pointed star ‘held to be a talisman against witchcraft’.65In early-twentieth-centuryGermany esoteric publishers pumped out cheap editions of theSixth and SeventhBooks of Mosesthat found their way into the hands of many rural cunning-folk. Itwas in France though, the home of the cheap print grimoire, that the occultistswere most attuned to a wider audience and the mundane magical needs ofthe people. The most successful at tapping into this was Julien-Ernest Houssay(1844–1912).Abbe ́Julio, as Houssay was better known, was forced to leave the priesthoodafter alienating himself from his superiors and being accused of fraud.66Freeinghimself from the ties of theRoman Catholic establishment he devoted his energiesRediscovering Ancient Magic|185"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Fig.16A prayer to recite before reading the books or using the pentacles of Abbe ́Julio. A singlesheet sold separately from his books."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"to various popular Catholic publishing enterprises. His immersion in the occultside of religion seems to have been inspired by his relationship with a well-knownfaith healer named Jean Sempe ́. It was partly on the basis of the latter’s reputationthat Abbe ́Julio founded his own. He was also profoundly inXuenced by hisdiscovery of a seventeenth-century book of blessings in which he found all the‘curious exorcisms, ignored by the modern Church’, which he subsequentlyincorporated into his various publications.67Although Houssay was apparentlynever a member of any occult group, there is no doubt he was inXuenced by theactivities and writings of the second generation of FrenchWn-de-sie`cle occultistswho followed in Le ́vi’s footsteps.As we saw earlier, Mathers was living in Paris during the1890s and wasattracting considerable attention with his series of public ritual dramas called theRites of Isis, starring his wife, Mina, in Egyptian dress. But the main focus ofParisian magical activity was Ge ́rard Encausse (1865–1916), better known asPapus.68Born in Spain to a Spanish mother and a French father, he was broughtup in Paris where, while studying for a qualiWcation in medicine, he began toimmerse himself in the literature of alchemy, Kabbalah, and Hermeticism housedin the National Library. The works of Le ́vi were no doubt hisWrst occult port ofcall. In January1886, he wrote an admiring letter to the old master not realizing hehad been dead for more than a decade.69A year later he presented a paper at aconference on French Occultism which generated mixed reviews, with onerequesting that he give up public speaking.70He signed up for the TheosophicalSociety, though he left not long after, put oVby its Eastern mysticism. Instead hefounded the Christian mystic Martinist order and an Independent Esoteric StudyGroup. He also joined the Cabalistic Order of theRosy Cross, set up by his friend,fellow Le`vite, and shining light in the Parisian occult scene, Stanislaus de Guaita.Both Papus and de Guaita were at the centre of lurid claims in the mid-1890s thatFrance was under threat by an outbreak of Satanism inspired by Freemasons andoccultists with Encausse being denounced as ‘the demon Papus’. The accusationswere spread through a series of articles written by Le ́o Taxil, a scurrilous anti-clerical writer who converted to Catholicism and who, to prove his new-founddedication to the Church, launched a campaign against Freemasonry. A. E. Waiteinvestigated the whole aVair in his bookDevil Worship in France.71Papus was a proliWc author on occultism and alternative medicine, but thebook that had a signiWcant inXuence on the wider world of popular magic was hisTraite ́me ́thodique de magie pratique,Wrst published in1898. It was heavily inXuencedby Le ́vi but contained so much information on practical magic that parts of itresembled a grimoire, and it was probably used as such by some French cunning-folk. Numerous talismans, characters, and prayers were provided, along withadvice on such familiar grimoire topics as how to render oneself invisible andRediscovering Ancient Magic|187"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"deal with witchcraft, all oVered without the scathing critical tone of Waite’sBook of Black Magic and of Pacts.Abbe ́Julio, who was more rooted in the provincial religious culture of healingand magic than the urbanite Papus, innovated by stripping out the esoteric andphilosophical content of such nineteenth-century occult works and providingpractical help under the auspices of Catholic piety. So, in1896, four years afterJean Sempe ́’s death, Abbe ́Julio published a book of the healer’s miraculousprayers entitledPrieres Merveilleuses pour la guerison de toutes les Malades Phisiques etMorales(Marvellous prayers for healing all physical and moral illnesses). Other workssoon followed on the back of this success.Les ve ́ritables pentacles et prierscontained aseries of talismans to be employed against evil spirits, witchcraft, and ill health,whileLe livre des grand exorcismes et benedictionsprovided exactly what it says, aseries of exorcisms and blessings—but for the laity rather than the clergy. The Juliooeuvre would not have been out of place amongst the oldBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires. As we saw in the previous chapter, the Catholic Church in Francewas quite successful in demonizing thePetit Albertand its ilk. So for those fearful ofthe old popular grimoires the ‘Catholic’ works of Abbe ́Julio provided protectionfrom misfortune, evil spirits, and ill health but under the label of ‘religion’ ratherthan ‘magic’. In this sense they echoed the reception and popularity of exorcismmanuals during the early modern period. No wonder, then, that like thePetitAlbert, they were quickly assimilated into the cultures of popular magic both athome and abroad. Abbe ́Julio’s books were adopted byquimboiseursin Martiniqueand thegadedzafehealers of the French Antilles.72One man interviewed in the1980s recalled a Guadeloupe sorcerer who ‘used books like the books of spells ofAbbe ́Julio’. The Julio spell book was described as ‘terrible’ in the sense that it wasdangerous to use, for if one read it at the wrong time and without properlyunderstanding the words the angels would come and destroy you.73The greatest popularizer of grimoires to emerge from the OccultRevival was,however, to be found across the Atlantic. Through the publishing activities of theAmerican book pirate William Lauron DeLaurence, the occultist of the HighSeas, the works of Waite and Mathers, and that of many others, travelled farbeyond the claustrophobic occult circles of France and Britain. They wouldWndan unimagined readership amongst African-Americans and the folk healers andmagical practitioners of the Caribbean and West Africa. So it is to America wemust now return toWnd out how this came about.188|Rediscovering Ancient Magic"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"CHAPTERSIXGRIMOIRESUSAThe production of grimoires was an entrepreneurial enterprise that thrivedwherever the inXuence of secular and ecclesiastical censors was restricted bygeographical, educational, or political factors. The opening up of America createdjust such an environment, and hucksters, quacks, astrologers, fortune-tellers, andoccult practitioners of all shades thrived. It is in America that grimoire authorshipbecomes a history of real if slippery personalities, whose success was tied to theimmigrant experience and the unique opportunities and social mobility thatopened up for those who were not enslaved or hindered by racial prejudice.A door-to-door salesman from Ohio named William Delaurence would emergefrom this entrepreneurial world to become a transatlantic sensation—as we shallsee later.The newspaper was a crucial facilitator in the development of the hugefree market for occult services, both nationally and internationally. One late-nineteenth-century folklorist, Henry Carrington Bolton, attempted to trace theadvancement of American society and consequent decline of ‘superstition’through studying the advertising pages of the press. Writing in1895he observed:These advertisements used to be far more numerous in the daily papers ofour Eastern cities than at present, and their decrease in number probablydenotes increase in intelligence; on the other hand, San Francisco news-papers are especially rich in these curiosities of literature, a fact indicatingthat superstition goes hand-in-hand with the adventurous spirit of therough characters whoWrst settle in newly-opened lands.1"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"With hindsight we know that Harrington was way oVthe mark. It was the citiesof the eastern half of the country that would, in the next few decades, become thegenerators of numerous occult organizations and magical publications, with far-reaching consequences. One reason for this was the development of African-American consumerism.TheWrst surviving occult book possibly written by, and perhaps for an African-American readership, wasThe Complete Fortune Teller and Dream Bookby ‘ChloeRussel, a Woman of Colour, in the State of Massachusetts’, published in1824.Russel’s introductory account of her harrowing life tells that she was born threehundred miles southwest of Sierra Leone around1745and enslaved at the age of9.She and her brother were bound with ropes by white men, whipped, and draggedmiles through the bush and bundled unto a ship bound for Virginia. Cruellytreated by her master she determined to kill herself but her father appeared to herin a dream to persuade her not to. Her prophetic powers developed through suchdreams and word of her abilities spread. People began to consult her about lostproperty and she accrued the name the ‘Black Interpreter’. It was her success atdivining the whereabouts of a treasure for a plantation owner that led him to buyher freedom. There was a ChloeRussel in Massachusetts at the time and it is quitepossible that she was the real author. As to its divinatory content, it was a run-of-the mill chapbook with much of its advice on palmistry, the signiWcation of moles,and rituals for obtaining husbands, culled from other such publications. It was onlytowards the end of the century that there developed an identiWable African-American market for cheap fortune-telling booklets, such asAunt Sally’s PolicyPlayer’s Dream Book.2As its title suggests it was aimed primarily at petty gamblers,like most such publications at the time.There was nothing distinctively African-American about the divinatorymethods explained in these books, and nothing of practical magic. Yet African-Americans in the southern states had a well-deWned and widely practised magicaltradition waiting to be tapped commercially—hoodoo. The use of the term wasWrst recorded in the1880s, and although it is sometimes used as a synonym forVoodoothey were two distinct traditions. Hoodoo lacked the organized aspectsand religious framework of HaitianVoodoo, which in the USA was largelyrestricted to New Orleans and was in terminal decline by the late nineteenthcentury.3Hoodoo doctors, also known as ‘conjure doctors’ and ‘root-workers’,practised a mix of herbal medicine, charms, magic, and prayers, and it was theBible rather than the pantheon of Yoruba divinities that underpinned theireYcacy. TheWrst cheap grimoire to exploit the hoodoo tradition wasThe Lifeand Works of Marie Laveau, published in the early twentieth century. It sold on thebasis of the legendary exploits of a New OrleansVoodoopriestess of that name.Detailed research has shown that Marie Laveau was a real person, but her portrayal190|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"inWction and folklore as an inspirationalVoodooleader of New Orleans’ African-American community is far from the mark. Her practice was hoodoo notVoodoo.4This was at least reXected in the contents of a copy ofThe Life and Worksadvertised for sale by a New Orleans drugstore owner.Reports of his prosecutionin1927describe a mail order catalogue he issued that itemized some250charms,as well asThe Life and Works, which contained ‘instructions for the use of charmsto win husbands, cause bad luck to befall a neighbor, and prevent others fromworking evil’.5The Life and Worksdoes not seem to have circulated widelybeyond Louisiana and neighbouring states. This is not surprising really for in thenorth there was already a long-established grimoire industry born out of the powwow magical tradition of the ethnic Germans of Pennsylvania.‘Pow wow’ obviously does not sound Germanic. It is thought to be a corruptionof an Algonquin Native American word, and was recorded in early-seventeenth-century English publications on New England to describe the native medicine menwho were said to conjure up the Devil and practise ‘exorcismes and necromantickecharmes’.6By the nineteenth century it had, by an intriguing process of culturalosmosis, come to deWne the magical healing tradition of the PennsylvanianGermans, which was otherwise known in local dialect asbraucheorbraucherei.7As one might expect from the descendants of the Pietist communities of theeighteenth century, pow wow doctors and their clients viewed healing as aChristian gift bestowed on a select few. Andrew C. Lenhart, a well-knownpractitioner in York, Pennsylvania, during the early twentieth century, explained,‘Some men have power. I have it. Power is given some men as a talent, just as Jesusgave power to his apostles.’ As a prominent unlicensed healer Lenhart was wellknown to the state board of medical licensure, but he was never arrested forpractising medicine illegally.8While pow wow doctors were importantWgures,the fundamental Protestant belief in a personal relationship with God also gener-ated a strong self-help culture of medicine and protection in PennsylvanianGermans. Books of simple Christian charms and prayers consequently provedpopular. One in particular came to dominate the market—theLong Lost Friend.‘Anybody could use the book,’ explained one woman. ‘You had to have a littlefaith, you know, you would have to believe in God.’9Friends reunitedTheWrst American-printed charm book produced for the ethnic German marketwasDer Freund in der Noth; oder, Geheime Sympathetische Wissenschaft.Thiswasasmalltwenty-four page collection of medical receipts and magical charms to stop thieves,charm guns, and the like. It traded on the success of a non-occult ‘book of usefulGrimoires USA|191"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"information’ for the beneWt of farmers calledDer Freund in der Noth, which waspublished in Germantown in1793. The preface to the magicalDer Freundprovided atypically hoary tale of a mythical foreign bookWlled with hidden knowledge:The following secret remedies were taken from an old Spanish manu-script, which was found at an old hermit’s who for over a hundred yearshad lived in a cave in the dark valleys of the Graubu ̈nden land, perform-ing in the same region many wondrous works, among others totallyexpelling from said regions the monstrous dragon with four young,which dwelt upon those fearsome mountains in Unterwalden.10The charm book that rose to greatest cultural prominence in the region wasanother ‘friend’—Der lang verborgene Freund,Wrst published inReading, Pennsyl-vania, in1820. It generously contained ‘true and Christian instructions foreveryone’, and its altruistic author and publisher was John George Hohman.Along with his wife and son, Hohman, aRoman Catholic unlike most ofhis fellow German emigrants, sailed from Hamburg in1802and arrived inPhiladelphia in October that year. Like many such immigrants they began theirnew life as indentured servants to pay for their passage. The Hohmans settled inAlsace Township, Berks County, and John soon began to earn extra income bypublishing and peddling German broadside ballads. In1811he published theWrstknownHimmelsbrieforCelestial Letterin America, claiming it was a copy of one hebrought with him from Europe. He later expanded his publishing business,producing a series of occult, religious, and medical tracts for the ethnic Germanpopulation, including a version of that European chapbook classic, the WanderingJew, a book of New Testament apocrypha, and a collection of hymns.11It wouldseem that Hohman also practised as a healer, publishing twelve testimonials fromsatisWed patients. Among them was an account of his successful cure, in1817,ofawheal in the eye that aZicted the son of Benjamin Stoudt, a Lutheran school-master, and also his treatment of Landlin Gottwald, ofReading, who suVered froma painful arm. It was, though, the enduring inXuence ofDer lang verborgene Freundthat has led the leading expert on Pennsylvanian folk culture to describe Hohmanas one of ‘the most inXuential and yet most elusiveWgures in PennsylvaniaGerman history’.12Demand led to several German language editions appearing over the nextcouple of decades, which were joined in1842with theWrst American printingofEgyptische Geheimnisse. Hohman’s place in wider American history was sealedwhen English versions began to appear.13It would seem that theWrst awkwardEnglish translation of1846,The Long Secreted Friend, was one of Hohman’s verylast publishing enterprises. It is now extremely rare, with a copy recently beingoVered for sale for $5,000. There was a moreXuent, anonymous translation,192|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Fig.17Title page of John George Hohman’sThe Long Lost Friend."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"published in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in1856, presumably after Hohman’sdeath, which sealed its fortune and the Hohman legend. Another independentlytranslated version,The Long Hidden Friend, which contained some small variationin content, was published in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in1863.14Both Englisheditions spawned further reprints, but it was the Harrisburg edition that becameubiquitous through numerous pulp editions produced during the early twentiethcentury under the titleJohn George Hohman’s Pow-Wows.Hohman was refreshingly outspoken, tackling potential critics head on. He saidhe would havepreferred writing no preface whatever to this little book, were it notindispensably necessary, in order to meet the erroneous views some menentertain in regard to works of this character. The majority, undoubtedly,approve of the publication and sale of such books, yet some are alwaysfound who will persist in denouncing them as something wrong.15He went on to point out that he sold his books ‘publicly, and not secretly, as othermystical works are sold’, and drew on his European experience when expressinghis appreciating that ‘useful’ and ‘morally right’ books were ‘not prohibited in theUnited States, as is the case in other countries where kings and despots holdtyrannical sway’.16For Hohman, God would not have revealed ‘sympatheticwords’ if he had not meant them to be used for the good of the people. He wasdismissive of the vain conceits of the medical profession, stating ‘whatever cannotbe cured by sympathetic words, can much less be cured by any doctor’s craft orcunning.’17As to the nature of Hohman’s ‘sympathetic words’, many of them were simplehealing charms for natural ailments in the tradition of those contained in FrenchBibliothe`que bleuegrimoires andMedicin des Pauvres. In fact, much of Hohman’scorpus was taken directly from theRomanusbu ̈ chlein, which as we saw in Chapter4hadWrst appeared in Germany in the1780s. Hohman could have brought a copywith him, though no doubt some already circulated in America. Some of thecharms were short adjurations, such as a remedy for the colic:I warn ye, ye colicWends! There is one sitting in judgement, whospeaketh: just or unjust. Therefore beware, ye come colicWends!18Others belonged to the European genre of apocryphal biblical charms. A previousowner of my own1856edition ofLong Lost Friendpencilled the words ‘very good’next to this charm ‘For the Scurvy and Sore Throat’:Speak the following, and it will certainly help you: Job went through theland, holding his staVclose in the hand, when God the Lord did meet194|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"him, and said to him: Job, what art thou grieved at? Job said: Oh God,why should I not be sad? My throat and my mouth are rotting away.Then said the Lord to Job: In yonder valley there is a well, which willcure thee, (name), and thy mouth, and thy throat, in the name of God theFather, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.This must be spoken three times in the morning, and three times in theevening; and where it reads ‘which will cure,’ you must blow three timesin the child’s mouth.19The book ventured into grimoire territory with several spells against thievingand witchcraft. It also contained instructions for conjurations, such as that ‘Tomake a Wand for searching for Iron, Ore, or Water’. A twig of one year’s growthbroken from a tree on theWrst night of Christmas was to be struck against theground while the operator said: ‘Archangel Gabriel, I conjure thee in the nameof God, the Almighty, to tell me, is there any water [iron, ore] here or not? Dotell me!’20People purchased theLong Lost Friendnot only for its contents but also for itsinherent protective power. Indeed, Hohman was commercially savvy to make thisexplicit, stating prior to the preface: ‘Whoever carries this book with him, is safefrom all his enemies, visible or invisible; and whoever has this book with himcannot die without the holy corpse of Jesus Christ nor drowned in any water, norburn up in anyWre, nor can any unjust sentence be passed upon him. So help me.’In1928an African-American named Charles D. Lewis explained that he hadcarried the book with him for sixteen years and consequently no accident hadbefallen him all that time. He had an adventurous and dangerous life working as aWreman on steamships. During the First World War the White Star liner on whichhe worked was requisitioned by the British Admiralty while sailing near Suez.Soon after losing his trusty copy he suVered an accident. He purchased another,and avowed that he never employed its contents to play the pow wow doctor.21By the early twentieth century numerous further editions of theLong LostFriend, some under the titlePow-Wows, had ensured that it wasWrmly cemented inthe medical tradition of ethnic Germans. The extent of its inXuence in Pennsyl-vania was revealed during an investigation by the Berks County Medical Societyinto the practices of pow wow doctors in the region. In1904it was reported thatthe Society had found that it was ‘almost exclusively used by the witch-doctors inpreparing their charms and in giving advice’.22Their concerns about its use wereperiodically born out over the next few decades. In1951a Mennonite couplefrom Ephrata were reported to the police after they refused to have their seriouslyinjured child treated by ‘scientiWc’ medicine. The couple had been ejected fromthe Mennonite Church ‘for faith healing beliefs stemming from a book by JohnGrimoires USA|195"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Fig.18Charms in John George Hohman’sThe Long Lost Friend."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"G. Hohman, ‘‘The Long Lost Friend’’ ’. The father told the state troopers whotook the boy to hospital, ‘If the Lord wants to heal the boy, He will heal him.’23In a letter written to the press in1904a Lutheran Minister suggested that itsinXuence extended beyond Pennsylvania, ‘possibly the larger portion of the countryeast of the Mississippi, and possibly even beyond.’24Folklorists have revealed that itsinXuence extended to the ‘Cajun in Louisiana, the hill man in the Ozarks, and othergroups’.25In the1930s an anthropologist researching African-American culture in aMississippi cotton town interviewed the most reputed ‘conjure-doctor’ in the area,who also received letters from white and black clients from Louisiana and as far asOklahoma. Unlike some of his local competitors the ‘doctor’ did not claim religiousinspiration or innate healing powers, but relied totally on his herb and magicbooks.26He was a man of little education, but like many a cunning-man in centuriespast, he set great store by his display of book knowledge, being the proud owner of asix-foot shelf of large encyclopedias. His magical prowess depended on a copy ofPow-Wowsand a copy ofAlbertus Magnus, or Egyptian Secrets, which was alsopublished in cheap paperback form during the1930s. When someone once oVeredto buy hisPow-Wows, ‘he atWrst refused for fear the white purchaser would use it inthe service of the Devil, instead of for God and Christ.’ Several decades later theowner of a Chicago candle shop, a place where the accoutrements of folk magic andmedicine could be bought, recommended that along with the Bible the only twomedical books that were required to stay healthy were theFarmer’s AlmanacandHohman’sPow-Wows.27Roback the wizardThe Long Secreted Friendmay have been theWrst English language grimoire to bepublished in the USA, but theWrst to boldly declare its contents as providing‘magical’ wisdom appeared a few years later. In the1840s another north Europeanfollowed in Hohman’s footsteps and boarded a ship at Hamburg with a prodigiousoccult career in America waiting. He was the astrologer, quack doctor, andpurported seventh son Charles W.Roback, the self-styled ‘President of theAstrological College of Sweden, and Founder of the Society of the Magi inLondon, Paris, and St. Petersburg’. These impressive-sounding institutions werethe inventions of an inveterate liar.Roback was born Carl Johan Nilsson in the village of Fallebo, Sma ̊land, insouthern Sweden, on22November1811.28HeWrst worked as a farm hand, butin his late twenties he moved to the nearest town in the area Do ̈derhultsvik,now part of Oskarshamn, where he ran a general store selling coVee, sugar,soap, and other staples. By this time he had changed his surname to the moreGrimoires USA|197"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"impressive-sounding Fallenius and married a woman named Greta Cajsa. In1843,however, he abandoned his family and set sail for America. The fact that hehad been caught out perpetrating a series of petty frauds, including signinga promissory note using a false name, just might have had something do withhis desertion.Roback’s humble and inglorious life before arriving in America is in starkcontrast with his own autobiographical account, which tells a far more nobleand extraordinary story. TheRobacks were a family renowned from Viking times,he claimed, and his ancestral home was a castle near Falsters, surrounded by rocksand ‘tall spectralWrs’. His childhood was one of great privilege and reverence. Fiveof his brothers were ‘courted, caressed, and helped forward by powerful friends intheir careers’. It was around the age of ten that one of them, Frithiof, disclosed toCharles his occult heritage as they talked in a vast apartment in the castle hungwith axes and spears: ‘He informed me that our race had been renowned for theirprophetic gifts, and their skill and attainments in Magic, Astrology, and otheroccult lore, for more than four hundred years.’29Frithiof revealed to Charles thatthese hereditary powers were rendered more potent in him by being the seventhson of a seventh son. At the age of fourteen Charles applied himself to the study of‘every species of Magic’ and then for many years he travelled across Europe, Asia,and Africa perfecting his knowledge of the magical sciences. ‘It would occupy toomuch space, and might seem like egotism,’ he said modestly, ‘to recount thehonors that were paid to me at the various capitals of Europe.’ Naturally boredwith his celebrity and the adulation he received, and ‘longing for a less artiWcialstate of society than that in which I had lately moved, I now determined to visitthat land of the frank and the free—the United States.’30The only passage of his autobiography that has any truth in it is his account ofhis vaunted success in the land of the frank and the free. He landed in America onthe14June1844and over the next nine years resided in Baltimore, Philadelphia,New York, and Boston. This itinerary is partly conWrmed byRoback’s mostardent critic, Thomas Hague, a disgruntled Philadelphian astrologist who styledhimself the ‘United States Astrologer’. He claimed to be theWrst American towrite or publish a line on the subject of astrology. He had certainly beenpublishing a range of astrological almanacs since1838, including the long-runningmonthlyUnited States’ Horoscope.31But Hague was no stranger to puVery anduntruths. In the November1851edition he boldly stated that ‘Even the incum-bent of the highest oYce in the United States, as well as their cabinets andsenators, has honoured it by a perusal: and why? Truly it is, they have adoptedthe Astrologer’s system, in his search of truth.’32Hague denouncedRoback as avile impostor and a corrupting social inXuence. On a personal level, he wasincensed toWnd thatRoback198|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"onWrst coming before the people as an Astrologer, paid several heavysums of money for judgements on nativities, which had been given byme,—and I have in my possession two purporting to have been writtenby him, which are almost verbatim copies of those obtained of me, abeautiful commentary upon his Astrological abilities!!!33In1851Hague decided to pour ‘heavy metal’ on his rival in the form of acoruscating pamphlet,Exposition of C. W.Roback, which included letters on thematter addressed to William F. Johnston, Governor of Pennsylvania, and CharlesGilpin, Mayor of Philadelphia.34According to Hague,Roback’sWrst occupationin America was running a grog shop in Baltimore, where he passed himself of asWilliam Williams, alias Billy the Swede or Dutch Bill. Around1847he wasobliged to decamp and pitched up in Philadelphia where he spent some monthsin the city hospital. Once back on the streetsRoback made a brief living chargingthe curious two cents a peek to see a small alligator he kept in a tin box, which heclaimed was a crocodile he had caught during his travels in Africa. He raisedenough money to rent an oYce on South Eight Street, setting himself up as acunning-man, curing the sick, detecting stolen goods, oVering to cast out Devils,and practising ‘Geotic Magic’. He now discovered the power of the burgeoningAmerican press and began to pepper the local newspapers with puVs. One suchadvertisement published in1850consisted of a testimonial from a Jane Carney,said to live three miles below Wilmington. She recounted how, frustrated by herlover’s timidity in proposing marriage, she had consultedRoback. He successfullyused his magic to induce the man to get betrothed, and performed the furtherservice of recovering the sum of $10stolen from her by a servant.35Hague tells ofRoback’s next bold move into the quack medicine business inPhiladelphia. Noticing the popularity of a local brand of German Bitters producedby Dr C. M. Jackson,Roback got together with a local German druggist toproduce his own version of the panacea—Hufeland’s Bitters, named after therenowned German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762–1836), whohad been the admired doctor of Goethe and the King of Prussia. Hufeland’s namewas well known across Europe, due in part to the popularity of his bookThe Art ofProlonging Life, which was published in several languages. The great doctor’sreputation would certainly have been known to many German settlers in Penn-sylvania during the mid-nineteenth century, and in1829a translation of hisTreatise on the Scrofulous Diseasehad been published in Philadelphia.Ratherdisingenuously, Hague does not mention that Jackson also played on the sameassociation, calling his product Dr HooXand’s German Bitters.Roback went oneaudacious step further in his publicity campaign though. He employed an associ-ate to pass himself of as the grandson of the great Hufeland newly arrived fromGrimoires USA|199"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Berlin. This impostor would prescribeRoback’s bitters and then refer his patientsto the conjuror.For reasons unknown, but presumably related to legal heat generated byHague’s expose ́,in1852weWnd thatRoback had removed to No.6WhiteStreet, New York. Once again, with his irrepressible entrepreneurialXair, hebegan to build his occult business through a series of advertisements in the localpress. One example took the form of a ‘Lecture on Astrology and Magic’ in whichhe stated, ‘Things which appear incredible to the skeptic and are scoVed at by theshallow smatterers in science, are admitted by the candid and the reXecting whenthe evidence is of a character so overwhelming and positive that to question it is todoubt all history’.36Another puV, which boasted of his many prophetic successesin Europe and the United States, also asserted that he could cure diseases con-sidered incurable by the rest of the medical profession. For those who came to hisoYce he oVered to ‘make no charge, except for the conjurations he shall make useof ’. He also advertised his ‘power for the restoration of stolen or lost property,which he has used for the advantage of thousands in this City and elsewhere’.37Another advertisement eulogized ‘Roback the Oracle’ in verse, concluding withthe boast that he had ‘assisted thousands of the world’s weary wanderers withproWtable advice, bringing them out of the shadows of despondency’.38One of hismost sophisticated puVs, devised during a sojourn in Boston in1853, was disguisedas a news item. It described how a band of around200Swedish immigrants hadjust arrived in Boston, and remarked that ‘while passing the residence of Prof W.C.Roback, the noted Astrologer, in High-street, the Swedes honoured theProfessor with three hearty cheers . . . as a testimonial of respect to their coun-tryman.’39Such wasRoback’s success at exploiting the burgeoning American newspapersthat his rise to national notoriety was swift. A book onThe Philosophy of HumanNature, published in1851, mentioned him in passing as a quack and conjurornoteworthy for his skill at playing on public stupidity.40The following yearCharles Wyllys Elliott reprinted one ofRoback’s advertisements in his book onthe supernatural to show that the ‘mystical profession is not exploded’. ‘Can it bepossible’, he mocked, ‘that there is any prospect of their endowing a professorshipin Yale College?’41By1860Roback was the most well-known occultist inAmerica. He received his own entry, ‘Roback the Wizard’, in Lambert Wilmer’scoruscating attack on the role of the newspapers in promoting bunkum andexploiting credulity, published in1859.42Another book published in the sameyear entitledHumbug, which sought to expose popular impositions, also singledhim out. ‘Who does not remember ‘‘Prof.Roback,’’ ‘‘the seventh son of a seventhson,’’ who sent you those ‘‘Astrological Almanacks,’’ and who is a swindlinghumbug of the most barefaced character.’43It is possible that it was such national200|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"press coverage ofRoback’s notoriety that provoked the Pennsylvania GeneralAssembly to introduce a statute against fortune-telling in1861.The laws against magic and divination were patchy. In the1840s theMassachusetts Penal Code included the prohibition of ‘Any person who, bypalmistry, cards or otherwise, for gain, tells or pretends to tell fortunes, or predictsor pretends to predict future events, or who practises as a profession, trade oroccupation the discovering, or pretending to discover to others, for gain, wherethings lost or stolen are to be found.’44However, at the same period, no such lawhad been instituted in Pennsylvania—asRoback was apparently aware. Accordingto Hague, a sympathetic city alderman had reassuredRoback that there was nostate statute that applied speciWcally to his magical and divinatory services. Thelack of one was highlighted duringRoback’s prosecution for fraudulent pretencesbefore the Philadelphia quarter sessions in February1850. Mary Meehan, perhapshaving read the testimonial of Jane Carney, had paidRoback $3on the under-standing that he would, by his conjurations, force a thief to return some clothesthat had been stolen from her. The jury found him guilty but Judge King castdoubt on the law of false pretences being appropriate in such a case. ‘In England’,he observed, ‘there was a special statute in relation to cheating by these means[1824Vagrancy Act], and he thought that it would be well for our Legislature tomake an enactment on the subject.’45According to Hague, he had been suedseveral times for false pretences, but had the charges dropped through bribery andby paying oVwitnesses and buying false ones.46It was not until a decade later thatthe Pennsylvania General Assembly instituted an ‘Act for the Suppression ofFortune Telling’, which went far beyond the British Vagrancy Act which inspiredit.47It was directed against:any person who shall pretend, for gain or lucre, to predict future events,by cards, tokens, the inspection of the head or hands of any person, or byany one’s age, or by consulting the movement of the heavenly bodies; orwho shall, for gain or lucre, pretend to eVect any purpose by spells,charms, necromancy or incantation.It also covered thoseWho shall pretend, for lucre or gain, to enable any one to get or torecover stolen property, or to tell where lost articles or animals are, or tostop bad luck, or to give good luck, or to put bad luck on any person oranimals, or to stop or injure the business of any person, or to injure thehealth of any person, or to shorten the life of any person, or to givesuccess in business, enterprise, speculation, lottery, lottery numbers orgames of chance, or win the aVections of any person, or to give success inGrimoires USA|201"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"business, enterprise, speculation, lottery, lottery numbers or games ofchance, or win the aVections of any person whatever for marriage orseduction, or to make one person marry another, or to induce any personto alter or make a will in favor or against any one, or to tell the placewhere treasure, property, money or valuables are hid, or to tell the placeswhere to dig or to search for gold, metals, hidden treasure.This was an unusually detailed statute in that it pretty much covered every aspectof magical practice, presumably with the intention of leaving as few legal ambi-guities as possible.It was while in Boston thatRoback branched out into the publishing world,Wrst producingRoback’s Astrological Almanac, andDr C. W.Roback’s Family PictorialAlmanac.In1854he published his magnum opus, the rather handsome, gilt-edgedMysteries of Astrology, and the Wonders of Magic, dedicated magnanimously ‘To thePeople of the United States, a Nation neither Skeptical nor Credulous’, and inwhich he boasted he had ‘given audience to more than two hundred thousandapplicants for magical information’.48It was not a roaring success and its contentsdid not live up to the anticipated occult treasures the title suggested.Regarding itsastrological worth, the astrologist Luke Broughton (1828–98), a linen weaver’sson from Leeds, England, claimed thatRoback paid a newspaper reporter tocompile the astrology sections of the book. He denouncedRoback as ‘a perfectfraud and an impostor, who knew no more of astrology than he did aboutXying’.49Broughton, who came from a family well known in Leeds for theirastrological skills, arrived in America in the1850s and settled in Philadelphia. Heclaimed he was soon ‘acquainted with nearly every man in the United States whohad any knowledge of the subject’. At the time, he recalled, ‘there was not anAmerican, either man or woman, in the whole United States who could evenerect a horoscope,’ and the few astrologers who could were French, English, andGerman immigrants.50Amongst them he presumably included Hague, who, asthe1850census shows, was also born in England. Of the six astrologers recordedin the1880American census three were English and one was German.As to the magical content of theMysteries of Astrology, it contained neitherspells nor instructions on conjuration. Yet some people no doubt purchased itpresuming that it did. In1863, for instance, the Mormon William Clayton wroteto a New York City bookseller requesting two copies ofMysteries of Astrology, and‘theWnest and best article of Parchment that can be obtained’. While he later saidhe required the parchment to draw up deeds, the fact that a few months later hedesired to obtain a ‘Secret Talisman’ suggests that he wanted to consultRoback’sbook for advice on magical protection. If so, he was destined to be disappointed.51The book was aXop. As well as lacking practical occult information, with its thick,202|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Fig.19Purported portrait of Charles W.Roback looking suspiciously like a seventeenth-century astrologer."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"gilt-edged pages it was also too expensive to be a mass success. In1857aPhiladelphia bookseller was selling it for $2.50,52which was nearly as much as aweek’s wage for an agricultural worker and a third of an artisan’s weekly salary.53In1855weWndRoback advertising his astrological services from his new basein Cincinnati, Ohio, where he lived out the rest of his life.54By1860he seems tohave stopped promoting his astrological and magical powers and prospered byselling his own brand of quack medicines, cashing in on the vogue for bloodpuriWers and bitters. He continued to maintain sporadic contact with his familyback in Sma ̊land until his death in Cincinnati on the8May1867. In his will he setaside $6,000in restitution of lawful claims made against him by Swedish creditors.He also left a thousand dollars in gold to his brother-in-law, $300to his nephew,and the rest of his estate to his son Carl Wilhelm.55His dubious life andXourishingcareer in America did not go unnoticed in his homeland. Two pamphlets werepublished shortly before and after his death recording the progress of the Fallebogo ̈k(peasant), the ‘humbug’ who found an ideal outlet for his huckstering in theland of opportunity.56He was portrayed as the anti-Lind; in other words, a Swedewho gave a bad name to his homeland in contrast to the soprano Jenny Lind, theinternationally popular ambassador of Swedish culture who toured America in1850. The visit was a greatWnancial success for herself and her promoter P. T.Barnum, andRoback, of course, could not help make capital out of his fellowcountrywoman, boasting that he had ‘foretold the success of Jenny Lind, andactually named in advance the sum she would realise in the United States’.57Roback traded on his foreignness, advertising himself at one time as the ‘greatSwedish Soothsayer and Necromancer’, and in theMysteries of Astrologyhe playedon his Viking heritage.58He also laid claim to the exclusive possession of themedical secrets of his homeland, marketing quack medicines such as his Scandi-navian Vegetable Blood Pills and PuriWer, which he said consisted of ‘twenty-three diVerent species of mountain herbs of his native land’.59Yet, unlikeHohman, he did not write speciWcally for an ethnic immigrant audience. Hismagical and astrological knowledge was not based on the Scandinavian black booktradition, and he did not even refer to the possession of such a grimoire in hisadvertisements. Large-scale Scandinavian emigration to the United States onlybegan in the late1860s, and so inRoback’s day the Swedish settler communitiescould not provide the strong ethnic market that sustained Hohman’s occultenterprises.Roback was hugely successful at appealing to all Americans throughthe canny exploitation of newspapers. What he failed to grasp was the appeal ofthe older chapbook tradition and the demand for practical magic.The honour of producing theWrst American Scandinavian black book goes tothe publisher John Anderson (1836–1910), who arrived from Norway at the age of9and went on to set up a Norwegian language press in Chicago. The city was the204|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"main destination for many Norwegian emigrants, with around a third of theestimated150,000Norwegian Americans settled there by the end of the century.Anderson was concerned about the decline of the Norwegian language inAmerica, observing that to preserve it ‘we will have to supply our bookshelveswith some of our fatherland’s literature.’60Up until Anderson’s venture in the1870s nearly all the Norwegian literature printed in America had been religious innature, so Anderson set about producing books of folklore, poems, novels,histories—and magic. A former employee recalled in his memoir that in1899‘Svarteboken, dealing with witchcraft’ were amongst theWrm’s best sellers.61Oneof them was probably a cheap book entitledOldtidens Sortebog(Ancient black book),published in Chicago in1892.62Only one known copy survives today. It isan almost exact reproduction of a charm book of the same name publishedin Denmark, the main diVerence between the two being the cover. TheCopenhagen edition depicts the Devil sitting on a crescent moon while theChicago version displays its American status by having a picture of a bald eagle.It contained a familiar mix of magical charms for ailments, catching thieves,warding off enemies, and provoking love. A ‘key’ to the secret of the charms,signed ‘Cyprianus’, was provided at the back of the book, which reveals that theformulas provided had to be read in reverse. The most unusual aspect ofOldtidensSortebogis the story it tells of its origin. In the introduction, purportedly written bya monk, Cyprianus is revealed to be a beautiful, fourteenth-century Mexican nun!Incarcerated in a dungeon by a debauched cleric, Cyprianus makes pages fromshreds of her clothes and writes down her accumulated wisdom in her own bloodto preserve them for posterity. This book of secrets laterWnds its way into thepossession of a Danish knight and magician who buries it in a golden box. It layshidden for ages until a peasant stumbles across it while ploughing and becomesrich from the power it gives him.No doubt Anderson had dual motives in publishingsvarteboken. They wereevidently a proWtable business proposition. Although some Norwegian immi-grants brought black books with them, demand for familiar medical charms musthave been considerable, particularly amongst rural dwellers. For those Norwegiansettlers who founded Coon Prairie, Wisconsin, for instance, there was not atrained doctor within150miles. Others desired the means to call up the Devil.In the early twentieth century a Norwegian-American farmer from Dawson,Minnesota, wrote a letter to the Oslo University Library requesting: ‘Do youhave the Black Book that can release Satan and bind him again? If you have it inclear Norwegian, let me know the price.’63Yet at the same time as Anderson wascommercially exploiting popular magical belief, he was also fulWlling his aimof ensuring that Norwegian-Americans had access to the literary and culturalheritage of their homeland.Grimoires USA|205"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Hex doctors and murderersThere was no clear-cut distinction between a pow wow doctor and a hex or witchdoctor in Pennsylvanian German folklore, but there were those who did muchmore than cure ailments with herbs, prayer, and charms from theLong Lost Friend.Hex doctors were known for not only curing the bewitched but also for pre-venting witchcraft and dealing with witches. For such a task Hohman’s book wasuseful but not as potent and rich in talismanic aid as theSixth and Seventh Books ofMoses. Considering that the magic book market of the mid-nineteenth centuryprimarily catered to Pennsylvania Germans, it is no surprise that theWrst Americanedition of the Moses Books appeared in German in the1860s. English editions,clearly based on an example given in Scheible’sDas Kloster, were printed in NewYork and Elizabethville, Pennsylvania, in1880.64The preface of the New Yorkedition shared the forthrightness of Hohman’s defence of the value of cheapoccult literature, and was honest regarding its usage. ‘Let us not, therefore,underrate this branch of popular literature,’ it stated, observing that ‘the issue ofa cheap edition will be more serviceable than the formerly expensive productionson sorcery, which were only circulated in abstract forms and sold at extortionaterates.’While theLong Lost Friendwas considered a pious workThe Sixth and SeventhBooks of Moseshad a more sinister reputation amongst Pennsylvania Germans. In1929the hex doctor Andrew C. Lenhart told a journalist that he had read both theLong Lost Friendand theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, but ‘once was enough’regarding the latter. A friend had asked Lenhart to obtain a copy from Harrisonburg.He read only a few pages before becoming afraid, and recalled:I was sitting in my home at night. Suddenly a voice in the hallway calledme. I went there. I said, ‘Who is it?’ There was no answer. I started toread again. The voice called me once more. It was spooky. I went to thehallway again, but there was no answer. I again started to read. Suddenlyin the silence of the room I heard awful voices which sounded as if aXockof geese were quacking. It was terrible. I closed the book and the noisesceased.65For hex doctors, though, possession of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswasessential to building a reputation. In1900, for instance, Mr and Mrs Frederick GarlofReading hired a hex doctor to rid the family of the witchcraft they believed hadkilled eleven of their infants in succession. He provided a charm to protect thetwelfth baby, which he said was from a copy of theSeventh Book of Moseswrittenin pen and red ink.66In February1906, a few days before hisWght with theChicago boxer Kid Hermann, the Mexican-American Aurelio Herrera received a206|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"letter from a woman, who described herself as a ‘student of the occult science’,which contained a charm to help him win. ‘I have a receipt taken from theseventh book of Moses’, she wrote, ‘which I have prepared and feel conWdent thatif concealed upon your person during the battle you will be victorious.’ Thecharm consisted of a bit of cardboard decorated with horseshoes, symbols, andwriting in German script. ‘Should you win’, concluded the entrepreneurialoccultist, ‘you will be glad to reward me. The amount I leave entirely to yourgood judgement.’ When Kid Hermann was told about the charm, he quipped, ‘IfAurelio wins next Friday night he’ll have to have one of those German charms ineach glove.’67TheWght ended in a draw after twenty rounds.TheSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswas more generally associated withbewitching rather than countering witchcraft. During a divorce hearing inPittsburgh in July1919Mrs Sarah Bickel testiWed that her husband ‘took theSeventh Book of Mosesand tried to put spells on me and he said would put spirits inthe house after me.’68Its malign reputation was enhanced by a widely reportedmurder case in June1916.Peter Leas, a41-year-old blacksmith ofReading, Pennsylvania, ambushed afriend named Abraham Fick, a farmhand, stunned him with the handle of an axeand then chopped oVhis head. Leas was evidently psychotic, his wife and childrenhavingXed two weeks previously after he had threatened her with a knife. Leasgave himself up to the police shortly after the murder; ‘A Handbook for BibleReaders and Christian Workers’ and a memorandum book containing numerousscriptural passages were found in his pockets. In his confession Leas said that hehad visited a charcoal burner several miles from his house who had consultedTheSeventh Book of Mosesand declared that Fick intended to murder Leas. So Leasdecided he had better actWrst. The suggestion by some of the press was that Leas’sinsanity had been provoked by his own reading of theSeventh Book of Moses.69Some of the Moses books’ baleful associations were transferred to theLong LostFriendfollowing another ‘hex murder’ that gripped the American press. In lateNovember1928the bound, beaten, and burned body of Nelson D.Rehmeyerwas found at his isolated farmhouse in York County. John Curry, aged14,Wilbert Hess, aged18, and a petty pow wow man named John Blymyer weresoon arrested on suspicion of murder. The Hess family, who wereRehmeyer’sneighbours, had been experiencing a series of misfortunes on their farm. Wilberthad succumbed to a series of illnesses which had only been cured after his parentshad him powwowed. Witchcraft was suspected. Blymyer, along with his sidekickCurry, was called in to oVer his advice and identify the witch. Blymyer, whosuVered from hallucinations, believed he was also hexed, saying he had been toldas much by the pow wow doctor Andrew C. Lenhart. He had also consultedRehmeyer on several occasions.Grimoires USA|207"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Fig.20Talismans from an early twentieth-century pulp edition of theSixth andSeventh Books of Moses."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Rehmeyer was considered a peculiar fellow in the area. This was partly becausehe was separated from his family, and partly because he was an active and vocalsocialist: it was also because he was thought to dabble inbraucherei. Blymyer andothers knew he possessed theLong Lost Friend, and it was Blymyer who pointedtheWnger atRehmeyer as the cause of all their problems. Blymyer believed that hecould break the hex upon them by cutting a lock ofRehmeyer’s hair and buryingit, and conWscating and burning hisLong Lost Friend. It is not clear from the trialreports whether Blymyer believed thatRehmeyer used theLong Lost Friendto hexpeople or whether he thought that the protective powers of the book made himimmune to counter witchcraft. The latter seems the most likely considering itscontent and generally benign reputation. Blymyer knew the book well enough,for when police searched his room in York they found notes and charms tran-scribed from theLong Lost Friendand theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses.On the evening of27November Blymyer, Curry, and Wilbert set oVforRehmeyer’s farmhouse to fulWl Blymyer’s plan. They brought with them a longlength of rope to bind him. There is no evidence to suggest they had murder ontheir minds, but in the struggle to pacifyRehmeyer, they kicked him and hit himover the head with a piece of wood and a chair. As soon as they realized he wasdead they doused the corpse and set it alight. TheyXed not realizing that theWresoon extinguished itself, leaving the murder scene intact. Blymyer and Curry wereconvicted ofWrst degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Blymyer’s lifeterm in the Eastern State Penitentiary was commuted in1953. He took up a job as anight watchman and died a lonely recluse in1972. Curry served ten years of hissentence and was then granted a special dispensation to join the army. Afterreceiving training as a cartographer he participated in the drafting of the Normandyinvasion maps. He returned to York County and became respected for his work onbehalf of the York Art Association. He died in1963. Hess served a ten-yearsentence for second degree murder and lived out his life in welcome obscurity.70As the news broke and the trials proceeded, the press went into overdrive withheadlines screaming, ‘York’s Voodoo Cult’, ‘Scores of Deaths are Laid at Door ofPow-Wow Cult’, and ‘York County Held in Grip of Black Art Practices’.71Overthe next few years the Pennsylvania authorities were highly sensitive to theinXuence of hex doctors and their books. Only a couple of months after thetrial, state troopers arrested an Allentown hex doctor named Charles T. Bellesafter the body of a young woman named Verna Delp was found in aWeld nearCatasauqua, Pennsylvania. The District Attorney became convinced that herdeath was linked withhexerei. What newspapers described variously as ‘threemystical scrolls of witchcraft’ or ‘cryptic missives’ were found on the body.72Furthermore Delp, the adopted daughter of a prosperous farmer named AugustDerhammer, had, on the recommendation of her father, visited the hex doctor onGrimoires USA|209"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"several occasions for an undisclosed illness. The District Attorney expressed hisfrustration at the wall of silence from the local community, who were reluctant totalk of the hex doctor and his activities.73In January1932suspicions ofhexereiwere also raised when the lacerated body of a young Mennonite church worker,Norman Bechtel, was found in Germantown. He had been stabbed some twentytimes with a stiletto knife. One newspaper reported that ‘weird symbols’ had beencarved into his forehead. Another called it ‘a crime of mysticism’, another aPennsylvania ‘hex murder’. A few days later, however, investigators shifted theirattention to the idea that he was a victim of a serial killer at large nicknamed ‘3X’.Two years later the Department of Public Instruction launched a campaign againsthex doctors after a young farmhand named Albert Shinsky, of Shenandoah, shotdead a63-year-old woman believing she had bewitched him.74The press portrayal of theLong Lost Friendas a black arts or ‘witch book’ left anenduring stain on its reputation. When, in the early1950s, a folklorist mentionedit to a Dutch Pennsylvania farmer he was told, ‘To hell with that . . . I wouldn’thave one in the house, and the old folks would’ve been better oVif they hadn’t.’Twenty years later, an acquaintance of another folklorist tried to buy a copy froma bookstore in Norristown, but was asked to leave. The most recent detailed studyof pow wow practices in the state turned up no examples of its use amongstcurrent practitioners, though its inXuence continues through the charms andremedies that have been handed down.75Chicago: city of magic and mysticismChicago may have an image as a grim, grey industrial city but in the earlytwentieth century it was also a hotbed of mystical, magical, and prophetic activity.Rural Pennsylvania may have been the centre of pow wow and New Orleans thehome of hoodoo, but Chicago was the undoubted centre of organized occultismand grimoire publication. It was the archetypal American cultural melting pot,with a large portion of its population being foreign born, mostly from Germany,Poland, Austria,Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Ireland.76This national diversitywas reXected in the police department. The city’s chief of police, HermanSchuettler, worked conscientiously towards having every nationality representedin the force. When, in1908, theWrst Persian policeman was recruited, the pressjoked that ‘a Chinese patrolman is all that is lacking now’.77The city’s populationswelled further during the great wave of African-American migration from thesouth to the cities of the industrial north during the1910s.Racial tensions soonran high in the city with considerable violence being directed against African-American communities, including the bombing of homes.210|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"With its diverse immigrant population seeking social and economic stabilityand a sense of community, Chicago proved fertile ground for mystical andmagical groups. The prophet Cyrus Teed (1839–1908) evidently found it amore conducive environment than his previous troubled residences in Syracuseand New York, even if, according to Upton Sinclair, ‘the street urchins of thepork-packing metropolis threw stones at him’.78Teed claimed that in1869hehad received a divine revelation from God in the form of a beautiful woman,who gave him knowledge of the secrets of the Universe. He subsequently tookthe name Koresh and preached variously that the Earth was hollow, and that hewould return immortal after his death.79He once announced that he could makegold at will. The newspapers had great fun reporting on the pronouncements,fantastical schemes, and legal scrapes of what one newspaper dubbed the ‘ChicagoMessiah’.80More inXuentially, Chicago was also a spiritual home of African-Americanmystical organizations. At the Chicago World’s Fair in1893a group of African-American masons launched their own branch of the white Masonic AncientArabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. It is signiWcant that they inserted‘Egyptian’ between ‘Ancient’ and ‘Arabic’. The Black Shriners, as they were morecommonly known, never became a major African-American fraternal society.81One reason may have been that as well as its charitable activities more of itsmembers were serious about the mystical aspects of their order, contrasting withthe millions who joined the White Shriners, whose meetings were fondly mockedby Laurel and Hardy in their1933classicSons of the Desert. The Fez-wearingAncient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, co-founded by theactor Billy Florence in1871, stated that their guiding principle was founded on asecret Koranic work obtained in Mecca, which revealed a hidden Islamic trad-ition. While this story was generally taken lightly by its white members, the BlackShriners took their own version of their Arabic mystical origins more seriously asan empowering tradition.82In the1920s this, along with the Christian revivalismbrought to Chicago by southern African-American migrants, growing BlackNationalism, and aXourishing occult publishing industry, helped foster theMoorish Science Temple. This was founded by the Chicago prophet NobleDrew Ali, a self-proclaimed ‘Angel of Allah’, and a major inXuence on thedevelopment of the Nation of Islam, which in its early years during the1930swas labelled by an ignorant Detroit police force as the ‘Voodoo Cult’.83According to the unreliable hagiographic history that surrounds his life,Timothy Drew was born in North Carolina in1886to ex-slaves living amongCherokee Indians. He joined a band of travelling magicians in his early teens, fellin with some gypsies for a while, and at the age of16found himself in Egypt. Herehe met the high priest of an ancient mystical religion and underwent an initiationGrimoires USA|211"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"in the pyramid of Cheops. On returning to America the re-styled prophet NobleDrew Ali preached that African-Americans were the descendants of an Asiaticnation descended from the Canaanites and Moabites, which in ancient timesstretched from South America, to Africa and Atlantis. The descendants of thisnation were the founders of the Islamic Moorish empire. Like the Black Shriners,then, the followers of the Moorish Temple reinforced the notion that BlackAmericans may have come from Africa but their origins lay in the great civiliza-tions of Arabia, Egypt, and the East. They were the rightful heirs to the ancientmystical magical traditions that had fascinated Europeans for so long.Ali set up the Canaanite Temple in Newark in1913to spread this empoweringmessage amongst the African-American population, though in1925schisms ledhim and his followers to regroup in Chicago, which he believed would becomethe second Mecca. His followers were easily recognizable in the city’s streets asthey were required to wear red fezzes at all times. It was not long beforeinternecine strife began to fracture the Chicago movement. One cause of conXictwas that several leading members were apparently making considerable moneyselling herbs, magical charms, and cult literature to followers.84The prophet diedin mysterious circumstances in1929shortly after being released by the police, whohad interrogated him, perhaps brutally, following the murder of a leading Templefollower. The revelatory foundation text of Moorish Science,The Holy Koran ofthe Moorish Science Temple, was originally self-published by Drew Ali. Despite itstitle it actually had little to do with Islamic teaching, and was largely inspired bytwo early-twentieth-century mystical works, the authors of which spuriouslyclaimed their revelations to be based on secret texts discovered in Tibetanmonasteries.85One of them, Levi Dowling’sThe Aquarian Gospel of Jesus Christ(1907), purported to reveal the story of how Jesus wandered across Africa and Asiaaccumulating and spreading secret wisdom as he went.86The other text,InWniteWisdom(1923), claimed to be distilled from the mystical knowledge preserved inTibetan manuscripts containing the writings of the second millenniumbcPharaoh Amenhotep IV.The reputation of Africa as the repository of ancient magical wisdom also restedon the portrayal of Moses as an African. In the1930s an octogenarian African-American resident of Yamacraw, Georgia, explained how the biblical stories ofMoses showed that Africa was a land of magical power since the beginning ofhistory. As a consequence the descendants of Africans from biblical times had a giftfor doing ‘unnatural things’.87Advertisements in the African-American news-paper theChicago Defenderin the1920s show how gypsies and Hindu swamis werebeing challenged by Africans in the magical image stakes. Some advertisementsincluded photographs of the practitioners in African-style robes. One professorintimated he had ‘just had some very wonderful African Temple Powder sent212|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"from Africa to help his many friends’. Another ‘Master of Science’ describedhimself as a ‘Mohammedan native of Africa’, who would astonish clients ‘with themarvels of African Science, PowerfulRoot Herbs and Incense’.88Interest in ancient magical wisdom was also being fuelled by a burgeoningoccult press. In1918, in a piercing attack on religion and spiritual quacks in theUSA, the socialist author Upton Sinclair described how the shelves groaned withmystical magazines with titles like ‘Azoth; Master Mind; Aletheian; Words ofPower; Astrological Bulletin; Unity; Uplift . . . also shelves of imposing-lookingvolumes containing the lore and magic of a score of races and two score ofcenturies—together with the very newest manifestations of Yankee hustle andgraft.’89The advertising columns of the newspapers also indicate there was avibrant trade in new and second-hand books at the time. In1912the SouthernAstrological School, Fruithurst, Alabama, advertised a full line of occult books forsale, while in theOakland Tribunein1923advertisements appeared for a circulat-ing ‘Hermetic Library’ of ‘occult and mystical books’ at138Grand Avenue.90For the reasons described above, Chicago became an important centre ofoccult publication. At the makeshift end of the city’s publishing industry therewas Feliks Markiewicz, aka Professor S. Lanard, alias K. W. Sikonowski. In1912weWnd him selling a version of theSeventh Book of Mosesand other ‘secrets’ via hisGreat Supply Book Company. His customers must have been bitterly disap-pointed, though, for Markiewicz’s version of theSeventh Bookapparently con-sisted of no more than mundane recipes on how to cure colds and remove warts.His boasted ‘secrets’ were no better. One costing $3concerning how to bewitchcows read as follows:If you want to revenge yourself on a neighbour by making his cow dry,steal into the barn of your enemy before dawn in the morning and milkthe cow yourself and take the milk home. Get him to leave his homeafternoons on some pretext, and during his absence repeat the perform-ance.The spell for increasing milk yields was equally disappointing: ‘First get a goodmilch cow; if she is only a moderate milker, feed her some bran mixed with oatsand corn, and she will immediately give more milk.’ Markiewicz evidently founda niche conning Polish immigrants in this way. He advertised that for $2.50one ofhis publications would enable them to speak, read, and write English in seventy-two hours. It turned out to be a basic Polish-English dictionary with an instruc-tion that the purchaser memorize all its contents in three days. It was presumablyone of his many dissatisWed customers that reported him to the Post OYceauthorities.91Grimoires USA|213"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"In1900the little known Egyptian Publishing Company of Chicago producedtheWrst version of theSixth and Seventh Book of Mosesto be printed in a couple ofdecades. But it was an edition published in1910by another Chicago enterprise,Delaurence, Scott and Company, the producer of numerous esoteric and magicalpublications, which proved particularly inXuential in spreading its inXuenceamongst the African-American population. In contrast to the malign reputationof the Moses Books amongst Pennsylvania Germans, they were treated withreverence in African-American hoodoo and mystical movements. While thiswas predominantly due to the huge importance of Moses in African-Americanfaith and religious identity, the fact that it was produced by Delaurence may havealso given the edition an extra degree of spiritual aura. The Delaurence inXuenceis evident from some of the African-American cults and sects thatXourished in thenorthern cities.Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthews (1892–1972), founder ofthe New York Black Israelites, was the leader of one such organization. It wasone of numerous Black Jewish sects that believed they were descended from theancient Hebrews. Matthews told his followers that he was born in Lagos, Nigeria,whereas in fact he was brought up on the Caribbean island of St Kitts. It wasperhaps here that heWrst came into contact with Delaurence books.Raised aMethodist he became a Pentecostalist minister in Harlem and during the1920s, at atime when Jewish families were moving out of the area, he began to integrateJudaic ritual and celebration into his church’s worship. An examination of hispapers reveals how he also wove grimoire magic into his communication with theDivine. Matthews was no doubt familiar with Delaurence’s esoteric religiouspublications on the immanence of God and the like. It was, however, the appar-ently Hebraic symbols and seals that attracted him to theSixth and Seventh Books ofMoses, and which shaped what he called his ‘cabalistic science’. From amuletsfound in Matthews personal papers we can see how he borrowed from those in theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosesto invoke the presence and power of God.92The same Delaurence edition also seeped deep into the thoughts and practicesof rural African-Americans as well. In the1930s, the folklorist Harry MiddletonHyatt travelled up and down the eastern half of the country interviewing over1,600African-Americans about their magical beliefs. He found theSixth andSeventh Bookswas already an integral aspect of hoodoo conjuration, used inconjunction with the Bible. As one hoodoo practitioner from Washington DCexplained, ‘you kin take and look in de Sixth and Seventh Book of Moses andWndout whut to read, and den you go in yo’ Bible and read it from yo’ Bible.’ Thepractitioner said that he was particularly familiar with the fourth psalm ‘in order toaccomplish things that you desire’.93It runs as follows:214|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"If you have been unlucky hitherto, in spite of every eVort, then youshould pray this Psalm three times before the rising of the sun, withhumility and devotion, while at the same time you should impress uponyour mind its ruling holy name, and each time the appropriate prayer,trusting in the help of the mighty Lord, without whose will not the leastcreature can perish. Proceed in peace to execute your contemplatedundertaking, and all things will result to your entire satisfaction.The holy name is called: Jiheje (He is and will be), and is composed of the fourWnal letters of the words Teppillati, verse2; Selah, verse5; Jehovah, verse6; andToschiweni, verse9. The prayer is as follows:May it please Thee, oh, Jiheje, to prosper my ways, steps and doings.Grant that my desire may be amply fulWlled, and let my wishes be satisWedeven this day, for the sake of Thy great, mighty and praiseworthy name.Amen!—Selah!—94Hyatt asked, ‘Is this Psalm in the Bible or in the Book of Moses?’ The reply was,‘Both—but de meanings in de Book of Moses—Sixth and Seventh Books ofMoses.’ During the1930s cheap paperback editions of theSixth and Seventh Bookswere produced in their thousands, but Delaurence’s name remained indeliblyassociated with it—besides much else magical. When Hyatt asked anotherWashington DC interviewee who used theSixth and Seventh Bookswhere toobtain the necessary ‘dove’s blood’ ink and parchment to write magic prayers, thereply was, ‘Ah know one in Chicago.’ When asked the name, the reply was ahesitant, ‘Ah don’t lak tuh call dese names. Ah don’t know whethah ah’d be doin’right den.’Reassured by Hyatt, he then said, ‘Well, de Lawrence.’95DelaurenceWilliam Lauron Delaurence was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in1868.96His fatherwas French-Canadian and his mother Pennsylvania Dutch. Around the age of17he worked as aXagman on the PennsylvaniaRailroad, warning those working onthe tracks of oncoming trains, before taking up the same role at the Euclid AvenueCrossing, Cleveland. In his early twenties he started to sell books on psychologyand hypnotism door-to-door,Wrst in Cleveland and then further aWeld. Aroundthe age of24or25he saw a hypnotist on stage at the opera house in Parkersburg,West Virginia, and began to study the subject and devise his own modest show. Inthe late1890s ‘Professor’ Delaurence commenced oVering lessons in hypnotism inGrimoires USA|215"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Pittsburgh before setting up a school of hypnotism in Chicago around1900.Sobegan the career of America’s most inXuential occultist.While on the road Delaurence had put together his own manuscript onhypnotism and submitted it to Fred Drake of the Donahue Company in Chicago.Donahue’s main business was publishing children’s literature such asBlack Beautyso it is not surprising that the company was not interested in Delaurence’smanuscript. When Drake left to join the Henneberry Company he was able tocontract Delaurence’s manuscript and it was published in1901. The book soldwell but when Delaurence paid a visit to Henneberry to collect his royaltypayment he was told that the costs of production had been set against his royaltiesand that, in fact, he owed the publisher $15. Delaurence hired a lawyer andapparently successfully sued Henneberry for $350. Drake left shortly after to foundhis own publishing house, producing a couple of books on the tricks of cardsharpers beforeWnding success with an enduring series of do-it-yourself manualson engineering, electrics, sign-writing, and other such trades.The sales success ofHypnotism: A Complete System, coupled with his bitterinitial experience of the publishing world, inspired Delaurence to set up his owncompany, Delaurence, Scott and Company. It is likely that Scott never existed.When Delaurence was questioned in1919about his mysterious partner he wascertainly evasive on the matter.97TheWrst of Delaurence’s publications was arevised edition ofHypnotism, followed in1905byThe Sacred Book of Death, whichpurported to be a book of Hindu spiritism, though it is largely plagiarized fromAllan Kardec’sSpirits’ Book. By this time Delaurence, who had dropped the title of‘Professor’ and adopted the more modest ‘Doctor’, had become a self-styled adeptof Eastern mysticism, presenting himself as a Hindu swami. A trade directory atthe time lists him as the president of ‘The Delaurence Institute of Hypnotism,Hindu Magic, and East Indian Occultism’.98He also advertised his prowess as apalmist in the press, boasting of his international reputation and oVering to help in‘business, love, marriage, domestic troubles and all aVairs of life’.99As to Delaur-ence’s success with theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, he obtained the printer’splates from Fred Drake, and later recalled, ‘I bought the book because there weremany people selling it at that time for $5.00a copy and I supposed it would be agood seller.’ He thought Drake’s plates were a translation from the German, butwas not sure.100This was one of a series of magic books compiled and plagiarizedfrom a variety of published sources. One of his other successes wasThe Great Bookof Magical Art, Hindu Magic and East Indian Occultism, which initially sold for $12.As he advertised, it was ‘handsomely bound with a durable expensive binding,with lettering, oriental and occult symbols stamped in a beautiful bright metalknown as oriental gold’. There was nothing Hindu or Indian about its contentsthough. It was, in fact, a chopped-up version of Barrett’sThe Maguswith added216|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"photographic scenes of India and other extraneous engravings. Wherever Barrettwrote ‘we’ Delaurence merely replaced it with ‘I’.101It was an outrageous act ofpiracy and one he would go on to repeat with numerous other English occultworks of the period. In his reprints of theLesserandGreater Key of Solomon, and theSacred Magic of Abre-Melinhe did at least mention Mathers’ authorship in passing.Regarding the latter book, though, more space was given to the sales pitch thatDelaurence had paid $75for a copy in London while he was selling his Americanedition for a mere $5.50. He asserted that the cost of publishing and advertisingwhat he described as his ‘superior in every way’ edition amounted to $9,000.None of the proWts found their way to Mathers’ estate of course.102A hitherto unknown aspect of Delaurence’s career was his brief stint as leaderof a magic and miscegenation cult known as the Order of the BlackRose, whichapparently worshipped at the feet of a perfumed, wooden cigar-store Indian. Thecult sought to elevate African-Americans and consisted of two orders. Noviceswere initiated into the Order of the White Willow, which apparently consistedmostly, perhaps exclusively, of white women. Before being admitted each womanwas weighed in the nude. The ideas seemed to be that only women with goodWgures could progress. Delaurence would come to regret oVending an initiatenamed Augusta Murie, who he said was ‘too fat to be an angel’ and suggested thatshe take medicine to slim down. The Order of the BlackRose, the cult elite,naturally consisted of Delaurence and a select group of African-American men.While it is likely that the Black Shriners inXuenced Delaurence’s mystical racialideas, his cult aspirations were probably inspired by the Mazdaznans, a Chicagosect that also claimed a mystical Eastern heritage. The movement was founded byOtoman Zar-Adusht Hanish and was a modern formulation of Zoroastrian Sunworship, which married Eastern mysticism with the vogue for dietary fads.103Hanish claimed to be of Persian descent, though others stated he was German,Polish, orRussian. One report in1908suggested he was from Ireland and wasknown as Hennessy during an early sojourn in New York.104As one of hisadmirers, Professor Ardesher Sorabji Wadia, recalled, ‘I know very little aboutthe life of Dr Hanish for the simple reason that he himself kept it a sealed book.’105What a surprise.By the time of Delaurence’s arrival in Chicago, Hanish’s Sun cult had drawnmany adherents from the city’s wealthy white population, particularly the femaleportion. In1906one newspaper estimated that he had10,000Mazdaznan mem-bers in the city alone.106This is highly unlikely though, as his followers desiredsocial exclusivity and probably never numbered more than a few hundred inChicago. Considering his high society clientele, and rumours regarding the sexualand ritual activities of his members, Hanish periodically found himself targeted bythe police and press. In1908he was at the centre of a court cases involving aGrimoires USA|217"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"wealthy disciple named Ellen Shaw, who desired to give her fortune to theMazdaznan church, believing she was to become the mother of a new Messiah.Three years later the press reported that the Juvenile Protective Association wasinvestigating claims that the Sun Temple was luring wealthy young boys.107Hanish initially set up the Sun-Worshiper Publishing Co. and then theMazdaznan Publishing Company to spread word of his mystical insights. Thisincluded his1902workInner Studies: A Course of Twelve Lessons, which includedsuch topics as ‘The Secrets of Lovers Unveiled’ and ‘Magnetic Attraction andElectric Mating’. It was his mail order marketing of this and other works, particu-larly to wealthy women, which attracted the attention of the Chicago authorities.He was charged in1912and1913for circulating obscene literature.108Theseconcerned his descriptions of the naked form. Books of his sayings and precepts,such as theGreen BookandTheRoyal Goat, were produced in evidence, copies ofwhich I have been unable to locate. They may have been the product of journal-istic imagination—or Hanish’s. Then again, they may have been in manuscript orsmall private print runs. During the1908prosecution case it was stated that some ofhis publications were only issued to the ‘royal family’ of the cult. One newspaperreported that ‘these books are guarded almost with the life of a worshipper. Thereare very few in existence and only the very select are allowed to see them.’109In November1912the Chicago police raided Delaurence’s ‘palatial headquar-ters’ at3340Michigan Avenue after receiving a complaint from the defector MrsAugusta Murie. Investigations were launched by the Post OYce and the Depart-ment of Justice, and consequently Delaurence and several white women and blackmen were arrested for suspected mail fraud and oVences under the Mann Act(White Slave TraYc Act).110Shortly before this police raid, members had beenagitated by the plight of Jack Johnson, the world heavyweight champion boxerwho was in gaol awaiting trial under the Mann Act for taking a white woman,Lucille Cameron, from Minneapolis to Chicago for ‘immoral purposes’. Thewhole of Chicago was galvanized by the aVair. When the newsWrst broke inOctober angry crowds gathered in the streets and his appearance led to cries of‘Lynch Him’. The bigoted Chicago clubwomen started a national campaign tosupport the prosecution.111In this racially charged atmosphere members of theOrder of the BlackRose argued that their followers should employ their occultarts to ensure Johnson’s release. Delaurence disagreed, however, believing thatsuch a task was beyond the society’s jurisdiction. Shortly after this meeting,Delaurence and eighteen of his followers also found themselves in gaol.In the end, the authorities did not pursue a prosecution under the Mann Act,and the trial was concerned only with fraud. An African-American attorneydefended Delaurence and his followers. Murie testiWed that she only joined thecult in order to learn the art of hypnotism and became disillusioned when she218|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"claimed to have discovered that Delaurence had hidden dictographs in the lecturerooms to record his disciples’ conversations. The personal information he gath-ered this way was then used to give the impression he could read their mindswhen under the hypnotic state. Delaurence wasWned $200and his followersreleased.112It would seem that Delaurence disbanded the cult after this, though areference to it cropped up in1923during a curious federal investigation into theclaims of Helen La Maie, wife of theWlm director and theatre manager Elsier LaMaie, that her husband had tried to sell her to a mysterious, wealthy black gamblernamed Lou Harris for $500,000. Helen told the authorities that her husbandwanted her to become queen of the Order of the BlackRose, and that thiswould require that she take a black lover in order to further the Order’s aim ofequalizing the rights of ‘Caucasians and Ethiopians’.113This was not the end of Delaurence’s trouble with the law. Press advertisementsfor his books and his Institute were circulating in Nigeria. In1911Michael D.Williams, an African pharmacy student at the Colonial Hospital, Lagos, cameacross a Delaurence advertisement in a West African newspaper. Impressed by DrDelaurence’s vaunted powers and potent occult publications, he purchased a copy oftheBook of Magical Artand theBook of Death.In1914Williams decided he wanted tolearn directly from the Master and set sail for the USA. He made his way to Chicago,where he stayed at the African-American YMCA on Wabash Avenue, which hadonly been completed a year earlier but had already become an important centre formigrants. Delaurence gave him employment and received a money order from hisbrother back in Lagos to pay for his teaching. Williams was evidently by no meanstheWrst to make his way there. According to Delaurence a great many men had doneso before. ‘I never created a desire in any of these men to take up the study,’ he said.As to Williams, he ‘seemed to be well educated—and told me he wanted to be wellup in occultism, and it is a well-known fact that on the gold coast of Africa that ispractically the religion, and he said he wanted to perfect himself on that.’114Relationssoon turned sour, however. Delaurence described him as ‘an aggressive, quarrelsomeeducated proposition’. They had several altercations over Williams’ apparent habit ofpeering up the skirts of Delaurence’s female employees when they climbed thestepladder in the stockroom. On one such occasion Delaurence struck Williams whothen went and lodged a complaint with the police. Williams claimed Delaurencetried to hypnotize him against his will and had beaten him over the head with a chair.He returned to the premises with two plain-clothes detectives and Delaurence madeout a cheque for $150to settle their accounts. Delaurence later accused him of goingto the Chicago press and inducing ‘reporters there to write up certain copy about me,how I treated Negroes and everything of that sort’.115Delaurence’s last brush with the wrong side of the law was in April1919whenhe was tried by the Post OYce for ‘conducting a scheme for obtaining moneyGrimoires USA|219"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"through the mail by means of false pretenses, representations and promises’. Bythis time Delaurence, who described himself in his puVs as ‘the greatest teacher,author and publisher of Occult and Magical Works the world has ever known’,had given up the troublesome business of occult instruction. He had created a verysuccessful mail order and retail business, selling not only grimoires but also all theequipment and ‘talismanic and symbolic jewellery’ required by students of theoccult and those wishing to better their lives. There were invocation candles forcalling up spirits, ‘receiving of oracles, adjurations, and casting out of evil spirits’($2a dozen); the Venus, Woman’s Love talisman with special silken bag ($1.25);red coral rings and necklaces to ward off evil spirits and melancholy; and the ‘sevensacred magical art talismans, on genuine virgin parchment’. There was also a rangeof Hong Kong and East Indian remedies, some of which, like the ‘Lion StomachTonic’, he bought in from the Chicago Pharmacy Company.By his own account he had recently taken in gross receipts of around $40,000ayear and owned around $100,000in plates, stock, and merchandise. He estimatedthat around20per cent of business was overseas, mostly from Africa it wouldseem, since he complained that his proWts were slim on such orders due to the costofWrst-class post. He also sold a lot of books locally through Chicago and NewYork book dealers and stores including well-known names such as CharlesScribner and Son and Sears,Roebuck and Company. He also supplied theWestern News Company which operated railway newsstands.116One of hismost regular clients was the less well-known Oriental Esoteric Library inWashington DC. This had been founded in1905by the retired chemist andoccultist Henry Stokes to promote the dissemination of occult literature. It wasinitially part of an esoteric cult known as the Order of the Initiates of Tibet,though following a bust-up and consequent court case Stokes, who had ploughedsome $35,000into building up the library, assumed full control.117Delaurence was planning on opening a store and was negotiating aWve-yearlease at $3,000a year when he was ordered to appear at the Post OYce Depart-ment. While he was building up his retail business a Chicago Post OYce inspectornamed Dana Angier had been collecting damning material against Delaurence.One piece of evidence produced in court was Delaurence’s response to a letterAngier wrote to him under an assumed name, Gabriel Martin, in July1915.Angier was aware of the Michael Williams aVair and was evidently posing asanother African student of the occult.Dear Sir:Having been in this country now a year and wishing to complete mytraining, I am writing you for books on occultism and magic, havingknown of you before.220|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Fig.21One of many puVsintheDe Laurence’s Catalog(Chicago,1940)."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"In reply he received some testimonials, a blank order slip, and an oVer to send hisforthcoming catalogue for the price of ten cents. A correspondence ensued withAngier receiving numerous further advertisements for Delaurence books andproducts. He sent oV$2.50for a two-inch gazing crystal and ten cents for thecatalogue and requested:Now, sirs, I want you to tell me about your great book ‘AlbertusMagnus.’ Are these secrets genuine and such as I would be able toperform as I would like to do wonderful things. I will have moneysoon so I will be able to buy this book if it is genuine.118Although Delaurence or one of his staVdid not elaborate on the genuineness ofAlbertus, Angier purchased a copy for $3.35for his dossier. When it was producedduring the trial the acting solicitor for the Post OYce took a particular interest in itscontents, and several passages were read out, such as the following: ‘When a horse isstubborn while being shod. Speak into his ear: Caspar raise thee, Melchior bind, andBalthasar entangle thee.’ When he was informed that thebook was ‘sold by hundredsof diVerent stores throughout the country’, he remarked, ‘We ought to get thenamesofsomeofthose.’119Delaurence claimed in his advertisements for the bookthat it was a revised and enlarged edition under his editorship, but during the trial headmitted that he had done no such thing. ‘I attached my name there for the reasonthat I believe that when my name is on the book it helps create a sale,’ he said.120The trial also exposed his limited knowledge of the grimoires he sold.RegardingAlbertus Magnus, he was asked, ‘You put him down as a very great man, andenlightened in his writings, do you believe in them?’ ‘I am not familiar enoughwith his writings to say whether I would or not.’ When asked, ‘who was AlbertusMagnus?’, Delaurence replied, ‘He was a character weWnd in the Bible. I can’t givethe details, he is, I have heard of him spoken of many times.’121When questionedas to his key references on occult matters the following exchange occurred:‘Well, there is another book called ‘‘Transcendental Magic.’’ ’‘Who wrote that?’‘Levi.’‘Is he a doctor of medicine?’‘I don’t know as he is a doctor, I don’t think he is.’‘What is his education along those lines?’‘He is an author on natural magic.’‘What are his qualiWcations as an expert?’‘I could not tell you. . . . ’‘Any other authorities that you know about that would give anyknowledge on these things?’222|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"‘Well, there is a Waite, who recently died, he is the author of severalbooks in London....’‘What is Waite’s reputation?’‘Waite is held by the English press to be one of the greatest writers inthe world upon magic.’‘By the English press, what do you mean by the English press?’‘Well, the same as the press in this country.’A. E. Waite was actually alive and well at the time and outlived Delaurence byseveral years. He was hardly a darling of the English press though. While Delaurenceknew little of Waite the man he was certainly very familiar with some of his work.He had the cheek to pirate thePictorial Key to the Tarot(1910), written and illustratedby Waite and Pamela Colman Smith, under the titleThe Illustrated Key to the Tarot,and brazenly identiWed himself as the author.122He also reprinted theBook of BlackMagic and of Pactsand Waite’s edited digest of Le ́vi’s writings,The Mysteries of Magic,claiming mendaciously that the production of the English original was of poorquality compared to his American edition printed ‘on theWnest plate paper’.123Yet over the seventy typescript pages of his cross-examination it becomes clearthat Delaurence was not a completely cynical con artist exploiting beliefs hedespised. He accepted that some of his products had no power, that he had nomedical qualiWcations, that his virgin parchment was often not exactly virgin. Buthe discussed his personal beliefs and experiences of the occult with an honesty thatintrigued and impressed his examiners. When asked whether he believed in thepower of his parchment talismans he replied: ‘I believe in them. I have one ofthem, my boy has one. I know one man who I don’t think would part with thetalisman he has got for ten thousand dollars.’ He experienced premonitory dreamsand visions, said he had seen a vision in a crystal ball of men carrying a crystal in abox, and four weeks later he was burgled.124He had also received many visitationsfrom astral beings, such as those of Hindu adepts, and departed spirits, includingnumerous communications with his dead brother regarding his wife, and moresensationally Paracelsus.125Although it would seem that Delaurence gave up the idea of opening a retailstore in light of the close attentions of the Post OYce Department, his mail orderbusiness continued to prosper. We get a glimpse of his continuing success inNovember1931, when his new premises at179North Michigan Avenue wererobbed once again as the day’s receipts were being counted. The thieves boundDelaurence, his wife, and a stenographer with wire, and made oVwith $2,500ofjewellery. Tellingly, of the $500of cash taken $300, was in foreign currency.126Delaurence died in1936but for many in the Caribbean and West Africa hebecame more than a mere mortal. We saw in Chapter5how French grimoiresGrimoires USA|223"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"inXuenced the generation of new magical-medical religious cultures forgedthrough colonization and slavery. In contrast the inXuence of Delaurence overseaswas not a consequence of authoritarianism and population movements. It wassymptomatic of the rise of American cultural imperialism rather than colonialimposition. Before the Coca-Cola Export Corporation was set up in1930to mastermind what would become the global dominance of the beverage,Delaurence had already successfully masterminded an American cultural exportrevolution. But it is important to remember that Delaurence was not pushing aniconic American product, or even promoting American values. He was success-fully exploiting American commercial techniques to repackage and promote thewisdom and mysticism of the East and not the superiority of the West.Delaurence overseasUntil Delaurence the impact of European grimoires in colonial Africa seems tohave been negligible. TheBibliothe`que bleuedid not have the same impact inFrance’s North African territories as in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Therewas no cheap occult publication industry in Britain to export to its colonies.DelaurenceWlled the gap in the English-speaking African market. Nowhere werehis publications more inXuential than in Nigeria. As is evident from the MichaelWilliams aVair, his catalogues and his reputation was already circulating therebefore the First World War. There was a strong educated interest in foreign occulttraditions, the Kabala and freemasonry in particular. A branch of AMORC wasestablished there in1925, and Western occult literature and charms were adver-tised in the Nigerian press and were available in the streets of Lagos and othertowns.127The circulation of Nigerian magazines and newspapers also led to theWesternization and DelaurenciWcation of medical traditions in the neighbouringformer German colony of Cameroon. Work among the Wimbum tribe hasshown thatThe Sixth and Seventh Books of Moseshas altered their beliefs aboutthe source and workings of ‘bad’ or magical medicine.128Delaurence’s works inXuenced the development of several popular religiousmovements in Nigeria, such asMami Wataworship. This was centred on a waterspirit, the image of which was taken from a German chromolith of a snakecharmer printed around1885and copied and reprinted many times in Englandand India. The popularity of the image in central and West Africa generated ademand for Indian prints of other gods, goddesses, and spirits, which becameincorporated into theMami Watapantheon displayed in shrines. These also led toan interest in both Hindu and Western ritual magic, to which many Africansattributed theWnancial success of Indian immigrants and Europeans. Delaurence’s224|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"role in this is evident from an interview in the early1980s with aMami Watapriestof the Igbo ethnic group in Nigeria. Chukwu Emeka Ifeabunike, alias ‘DrCandido of India’, who claimed to have studied Hindu occultism in Bombayand New Delhi, practised magical healing, counter witchcraft, and fortune-telling. His shrine was full of images and statues of Hindu gods and spirits, asmall coYn, candles, pots, incense sticks, and other accoutrements of his trade.Amongst his most prized possessions were two books from the Delaurencecompany, theGreat Book of MagicandThe Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses.Hekept one of these outside the entrance to his shrine opened at a page in whichmagical signs were clearly depicted. The door to a ritual bathing area was carvedwith images based on illustrations from Delaurence books. Dr Candido, like manyDelaurence adherents, was unaware that he had long since died, praising him ‘as avery knowledgeable man’, and saying that ‘one day he hoped to go to Americaand visit him.’129During the1980s, anthropologists studying the Ibibio tribe ofsoutheastern Nigeria found that people were also ordering charms from theDelaurence Company at considerable personal expense.130The inXuence of Delaurence is less obvious but still evident in the inXuentialChurch of the Lord (Aladura) movement founded in1930by the NigerianYoruba prophet Josiah Olunowo Oshitelu. This former Anglican schoolteacherexperienced a series of visions and divine communications, which he wrote downin six large journals in his own arcane script, written from right to left as in Arabicand Hebrew. They also contained a series of sacred seals and signs. Magic andtraditional cures were prohibited by the Church, as followers need only place theirfaith in God and seek his aid through fasting, prayer, and the power of the psalms.Yet studies of the Church written in the1960s noted that members consultedWestern occult literature, and suggest that theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosesinparticular, had some inXuence on Oshitelu’s ideas and the construction of hissacred script and seals. Although Oshitelu never admitted as such, he did mentionin one of his publications,The Book of Prayer with Uses and Power of Psalms, that‘Some will say this is Moses’ Book therefore it is bad.’131Ghana was the other great centre of Delaurence. In the late1950s anthropo-logists found copies of theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosescirculating in thecountry. While it is not impossible that German editions found their way therefrom the neighbouring, pre-First World War German colony of Togoland, thesource of the English language editions was almost certainly Delaurence. Some ofhis publications such asThe Aquarian Gospel,Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, andThe Book of Magical Arts, Hindu Magic and Indian Occultismhave been found in thebookstalls of Ghana’s towns and cities.132In the1950s a patient at an Asante shrineconWded, ‘I have ordered the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, because with ityou can work wonders and without it you can’t go to England.’133HowardGrimoires USA|225"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"French, an African aVairs journalist for the international press remembered theawe surrounding theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosesduring his school days inrural Ghana during the late1940s. Some older boys indulged in fasts and ritualwashing and were caught murmuring incantations from the Moses Book, whichwas thought to have been imported from India, but was almost certainly boughtmail order from Chicago despite the fact that the Post OYce had prohibited itsimport. A cousin told him that it contained talismans ‘which could be ordered andused to attract girls, or to play better at football’. But if the instructions were notstrictly followed it could induce madness, and merely glancing at some of itscontents without saying the correct incantations would make one go blind. ‘Mydread of the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses was as nothing compared to whatI felt when I was told that there was another book that was even more advanced inoccultism, called The Eighth and Ninth Books of Moses,’ French recalled.134Just as we have seen how in Europe and America grimoires assumed greaterpotency for having supposedly originated from other countries, so in western Africaoverseas objects also accrued magical power. While Americans looked to Asia andAfrica for new commercial sources of occult inXuence, Africans looked to the West.An anthropologist researching the medical beliefs of the Wimbum of Cameroon inthe early1990s found that the tribal elders cherished their collections of Toby jugsfrom colonial days more than their ritual masks and elephant tusks, while knives andbugles oVered as gifts by German colonialists prior to the First World War werethought to have mystical qualities.135In the1950s a Swiss theologian, HansDebrunner, was disgusted toWnd that some literate Ghanaians defrauded theirfellows by selling magical charms marketed as being from overseas. One of hisrespondents observed: ‘some people, I hear, protect themselves against witchcraftby ordering some Indian and American rings and talismans. Ministers of the Churchand even some teachers do it, with the idea that the European-made protectives areneater and more portable.’136Some were local knick-knacks given a foreign originwhile others were, indeed, obtained from American occult catalogues.For some outside commentators this injection of Western literary occultismhad spread a pernicious mental virus that inhibited the development of WestAfrican culture. Hans Debrunner believed theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseshadled ‘to a sort of psychological slavery’ for those who owned it. A psychiatric studyof Ghanaians conducted in the1950s seemed to conWrm Debrunner’s fears,concluding that the expressed intention to make magic with theSixth and SeventhBooks of Mosesheralded the onset of schizophrenia. The government’s ban on itssale was thought to be in response to ‘its frequent use by incipient schizophrenicsin cemeteries at night’. For Debrunner, Western grimoires were ‘deWnitely worsethan the traditional ways of protection’, and he hoped that the pernicious inXu-ence of such imported literature would be broken as ‘good books’ became more226|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"accessible through the public library system.137Amongst the ‘good books’ was theBible of course, but for many theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswere biblical,and attempts to suppress them was just another example of the white man’sintention to withhold secret wisdom.Delaurence was and is respected in West Africa but in the Caribbean heachieved mythical status. The name of Delaurence was legendary in Nevis,being associated with the supernaturalWgure of a diabolic white-suited man ona white horse that betokened death. In Grenada one man, evidently conXatingDelaurence with Father Christmas, described him as a magician ‘in Chicago nearthe North Pole and lives with a large number of pigmy servants’. In the WindwardIslands theDe Laurence Catalogueis considered to be a black arts book in its ownright, used by those who call upon the Devil. The Chicago address of theDelaurence Company is consequently a jealously guarded secret.138WhileDelaurence had an impact in former and current French colonies where thePetit Albertalready had aWrm hold,139it was in the British colonies that Delaur-ence had the most profound inXuence.In Trinidad, which the Spanish surrendered to the British in1797, an anthro-pological study conducted in the1940s in the settlement of Toco, in the northeastof the Island, revealed how Delaurence had already become central to its magicalreligious culture. Among village elders ‘great interest was expressed in the booksof de Laurence’. One man observed that ‘the work that de Laurence does is acorrect Baptist work. They are taught in the spirit.’140The content of hispublications were absorbed into both Orisha worship and the rituals of theSpiritual Baptist churches, which went on toXourish after the colonial prohibitionof their services was repealed in1951. TheSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswerealmost certainly the inspiration for the various ‘spiritual’ symbols used in someSpiritualist Baptist ritual worship, just as they were in some west African religiousmovements.141Small groups of men would club together to share the costs ofbuying his publications such as theGreater Key of Solomon, theLesser Key, andAlbertus Magnus, as well as the roots, divining rods, and crystal balls oVered in theDelaurence catalogue. The island’s authorities banned Delaurence publicationsbefore and after independence in1962, but copies remained easy to obtain,though they fetched high prices.Recent studies of religious life in Trinidad andTobago conWrm the lasting inXuence of Delaurence. Today theKeys of Solomon,Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, andAquarian Gospelare consulted by most Orishapriests, and continue to be quite widely read by members of the various SpiritualistBaptist churches. They are treated as being equally important as the Bible. It hasrecently been reported thatThe Great Book of Secret Hindu Ceremonial and Talis-manic Magicis currently the most widely distributed grimoire in the country.142Grimoires USA|227"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Nowhere in the Caribbean did Delaurence have a more profound socialinXuence than in Jamaica. His works and products played a signiWcant role inthe practice ofObeah, while theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosesformed part of thecanon of mystical biblical texts inXuencingRastafarianism. ‘If you weren’t readingde Laurence in those days, you weren’t considered to be doing anything great,’recalled one Jamaican talking about theRastafarian movement in the1930s.143The sociologist and prize-winning novelist Erna Brodber recalled that during herchildhood in the mid-twentieth century Delaurence was a ‘mighty powerful forcein our rural peasant lives’. In her youth she puzzled over ‘whether De Laurencewas a man, a set of books or both’. As elsewhere in the Caribbean, he was no merehuman but a mystical, magical force.144Even in the1980s his name was a potentforce, with one businessman telling Brodber that the amazing successes of arecently instituted anti-crime squad were due to the fact that they were trained‘upon De Laurence’.145Fig.22Delaurence advertisement inThe Daily Gleaner,30August1939.228|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"In1931Norman Washington Manley, the lawyer and future Prime Minister ofJamaica, conducted the defence of an ‘East Indian’ named James Douthal whostood accused of practisingObeah. Indians, mostly Hindus, made up the largestethnic minority in Jamaica, many thousands having settled there and elsewhere inthe Caribbean as indentured labourers, encouraged to emigrate by plantationowners following the full abolition of slavery in1838. Douthal was the victimof a sting by the Jamaican police, who regularly employed such methods to trappractitioners ofObeah. An undercover policeman asked Douthal to do somethingagainst an enemy who was threatening his livelihood. For £44s. Douthal agreedto make his enemy go mad. He tried to achieve this by lighting three candles andburning a black powder and a piece of paper on which he had written somethingin red ink. The resulting ashes were to be sprinkled around the gate of the enemy’shouse. On his arrest, police conWscated books of ‘a religious, quasi-religious ormystical nature’ and ‘several letters to and from large publishing companies abroadshowing that the accused bought books from them, and was himself a student onthe subject of the carrying of talismans and the burning of incense’.146What such imported mystical works might have been is indicated by a trialthree years later. In January1934a young man of Cold Spring named LeonardWeakley was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for practisingObeah. Twowitnesses stated they had consulted Weakley regarding the theft of a cow atMontego Bay. They were suspected of the crime and wanted Weakley to usehis magic to ensure they evaded the law. When the police searched Weakley’shouse they found,The Sixth & Seventh Book of Moses; The Albertus Magnus or theWhite and Black Arts for Men and Beasts; The Great Book of Black Magic; The Book ofMagical Art; and theHindoo Magic and Indian Occultism. Weakley had obviouslybeen ordering from the Delaurence catalogue. Asked by the judge how he cameto be in possession of such books, Weakley lamely replied that they were not hisbut they were given to him as security for a loan.147When, a month later, IvanhoeBaker was charged with practisingObeah, and books of astrology, personalmagnetism, and theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswere found in his house,he similarly said that the books were already in the property when he moved in.148The law againstObeahin colonial Jamaica was directed at ‘any person who, toeVect any fraudulent or unlawful, or for gain, or for the purpose of frightening anyperson, uses or pretends to use any occult means’. More to the point, it alsoincluded a section against any person that ‘shall compose, print, sell, or distributeany pamphlet or printed matter calculated to promote the superstition of obeah’.The punishment was up to £30, or in default, up to six months’ imprisonment.149It was presumably the numerous court cases brought during the1930s that led theBritish colonial authorities to instigate further legislation to stem the DelaurenceinXuence.

Most of the other works on the banned list weretrade union and communist works. Magic and socialism were deemed on a par aspernicious social inXuences.While the government justiWed the ban as a means of protecting the peoplefrom those who exploited ‘superstition’ forWnancial gain, the Jamaican oppositionto colonial rule saw it as a cynical attempt by the British to limit the inXuence ofunionism and the American black empowerment movement.150Yet the banremained in place following Jamaican Independence in1962, and the list ofprohibited grimoires continued to be published periodically in the Jamaicannewspapers by government order.151The ban, like all such prohibitions, mayhave kept Delaurence oVthe shop shelves and out of the newspapers’ advertise-ments, but it could not stop his publications being read and used. Americanvisitors were one possible source of new illicit copies. An anthropologist inDominica described being incessantly asked by islanders to smuggle in illegalDelaurence tarot cards.152Although until the mid-1960s the USA had very strictvisa regulations regarding Jamaicans, some migrants who were allowed to work orlive there must have purchased Delaurence works. One of these was BishopKohath, a Kingston auctioneer and spiritualist healer, who read a range ofDelaurence books during a lengthy stay in the USA in the early1960s. Theywere central to the religious principles of the Black Jewish sect he founded onceback in Jamaica, the Yahvah Little Flock Assembly, Mystic Centre.153The law was the cause of considerable embarrassment in1970when the leaderof another of Jamaica’s numerous sects, Wilbert Peynado, Bishop of the Churchof Our Lord Jesus Christ, Montego Bay, and his wife, were arrested for possessingganja and a copy of theMaster Key, which a detective found in a trunk in theirbedroom. The case was swiftly dismissed by the magistrate’s court. A chemist saidthe substance recovered was ‘not ganja within the meaning of the DangerousDrugs Law’, while the presiding magistrate decided speciously, ‘this book isapparently written by L. W. deLaurence but there is nothing in the book toshow that it is published by deLaurence, Scott & Company incorporated ofChicago.’154When Michael Norman Manley, son of Norman W. Manley,came to power as leader of the left-wing People’s National Party in1972he liftedthe ban on seventy-one publications listed in the Undesirable Publications Act.Considering Manley’s socialist politics, and policy of rapprochement with Cuba,230|Grimoires USA"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"it was no surprise that most of the newly sanctioned publications were of a socialistnature, but the continued ban on occult works puzzled some. A lengthy article inthe leading Jamaican newspaperThe Gleanerfailed to make sense of Manley’sdecision. ‘There must be some good reason for this’, its author thought, ‘but it hasnot been made clear to the country. There is a strong suggestion here that freedomof political reading is to be preferred to other types of reading such as Black Magicor the Occult.’155Remarkably the ban remains in place today. The website of the JamaicanCustoms Service informs visitors that the following are prohibited items: ‘Allpublications of deLaurence Scott and Company of Chicago in the United States ofAmerica relating to divination, magic, occultism or supernatural arts.’156Recentresearch on Jamaican folk medicine reveals that, despite the ban, Delaurence’sinXuence spreads far beyond the chapels of the various revivalist and evangelicalgroups thatXourish on the island. He, his publications, and the company havecoalesced into a powerful spiritual and magical force. Delaurence is ‘science’. It isalso a speciWc category of occult illness. As one practitioner explained, there is‘natural evil’ associated with duppies (the restless spirits of the dead), and ‘Xyingevil’ which is associated with white spirits originating from Delaurence. They cancross water and are therefore not restricted to the island. They can be sent, somepeople think, from Chicago, the home of Delaurence, and also from England.157Delaurence can also cause stones to rain down poltergeist-like on houses, and sendXying razor blades to shred the clothes of people who have not paid their fees to apractitioner ofhisscience.Grimoires USA|231"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"CHAPTERSEVENPULPMAGICDelaurence began his publishing empire at a time when most books ofsubstantial length were bound in hardback. This kept production costshigh and, consequently, while some of his titles went through numerous editions,their price was still out of the reach of many. In1913, for instance, we find a smalladvertisement in one American newspaper offering new copies ofThe Book ofMagical Artfor sale at $5, knocked down from $12.1This may have been a bargainindeed, but it was hardly affordable out of loose change. As we have seen, cheap,mass-produced grimoires had been produced for several hundred years in Europein the form of chapbooks and theBibliothe`que bleue. But it was only in the1920s and1930s that a similar boom occurred in America as part of the influential culturalphenomenon of pulp literature. While Delaurence continued to publish hishandsome hardbacks with their gold embossed occult symbols, other small, enter-prising occult publishers exploited this new, mass-market book format, whichconsisted of coarse wood-pulp paper pages and glued rather than stitched bindings.American printers had always suffered from a shortage of rags, and by1857theUSA was importing over forty million pounds in weight of linen and cotton ragsfrom across the globe to sustain its publishing industry.2By the end of the CivilWar paper prices were at an all time high, and as one newspaper warned, ‘whilesuch prices prevail, cheap books and newspapers are out of the question.’ AcrossEurope and America the race was on to find a commercially viable alternative.Considerable entrepreneurial effort was expended experimenting with the pro-duction of straw, hemp, and grass paper. It was wood, however, which proved themost appropriate raw material and America certainly had that in plentiful supply."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The first wood-pulp paper mills were set up in the1860s and the shift away fromrag pulp began. The quality and durability of the paper was certainly not as good,but as a government census agent reported in1884, ‘it answers the transientpurpose for which it is employed.’ In other words it enabled a massive expansionin newspapers and pulp magazines. The latter became hugely popular duringthe early twentieth century, providing between a hundred and two hundred pagesof escapist racy, pacy fiction involving detectives, cowboys, romance, andscience fiction for as little as a dime. Sold in drugstores, bus and train stations,and newspaper stands, pulp literature was directed at and primarily consumed bythe urban working classes.3It was the success of such cheap, populist literature thateventually led mainstream publishers in the1930s to adopt the same productionvalues, heralding the paperback revolution.Pulp also came to signify not only the quality of paper but also the merit of thecontents printed on it—worthless, pappy, throwaway literature fit only for those toointellectually limited to digest more serious fare. They were not the sort of publica-tion that found their way into academic and public libraries. Yet their influence wassuch that, by the late1930s, American educationalists were waging war on the genre.One high school teacher writing in1937observed that some90percentofolderhigh school students read pulp magazines that required ‘no mental effort from thereader’. The ‘mere mention of ‘‘pulp’’ magazines used to fill my mind with piouswrath,’ she said. Further investigation led her to develop strategies to wean them offsuch literature, admitting, ‘the process is slow—dishearteningly slow.’4While west-erns, romances, and detectives were the mainstay of the pulp fiction industry, dreambooks, fortune-tellers, and grimoires provided the ultimate fantasy. Their contentsheld out the promise that readers could shape their own destiny rather than merelylive vicariously through the sensational exploits of fictional characters. The marketfor magic and divination was huge. In1943it was estimated that $200,000,000or sowas being handed over to an estimated80,000professional fortune-tellers in theUnited States.5The pulp publishers responded. Tens of thousands of copies ofTheSixth and Seventh Books of Moses,Albertus Magnus’s Egyptian Secrets,Pow-Wows: Or,The Long-Lost Friend, and theSecrets of the Psalmspoured from the presses, selling for adollar a piece on the streets. In the back of some editions was the publisher’sstatement in large type, ‘Agents can make big money with these books—apply toyour jobber or direct to us.’6As well as through mail order many copies were sold byurban druggists in African-American districts and in occult merchandise shops oftenknown as ‘spiritual’, ‘religious’, or ‘candle’ shops.7In1929an American newspaperarticle observed,It is amusing to find how possessors of such volumes as the Sixth andSeventh Book of Moses, ‘Egyptian Secrets’ by Albertus Magnus, ‘ThePulp Magic|233"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Long Lost Friend’ and similar publications set exaggerated store uponthem. They think they have great rarities of priceless value. Carefullyguarded, these books are usually kept for the eyes of the select few. Yetthey are the cheapest books in the market and are as common as almanacswhen you know where to shop for them.8The most successful of these new paperback occult ventures was the DorenePublishing Company founded in New York in1937by Joseph W. Spitalnick, theson ofRussian immigrants.9Spitalnick, who anglicized his name to Joe Kay, madea modest living as a jazz musician and in the1930s decided to supplement hisincome by becoming a small-time publisher, setting up first Dorene and thenEmpire Publishing a few years later. His first venture in the occult paperbackmarket was a manuscript given to him in1937by a man named Mr Young, aspayment for a debt. Kay hawked the publication door to door and found a readymarket amongst the numerous storefront fortune-tellers and psychics in NewYork. Other works followed, selling for between1and $3.One of Dorene’s earliest successes wasBlack Herman: Secrets of Magic-Mysteryand Legerdemain, which capitalized on the fame of BenjaminRucker, the mostsuccessful and well-known African-American magician of the era. The coverdepictedRucker sitting astride the globe, garbed in a gown, an amulet aroundhis neck and a scroll with ‘Power’ written on it in one hand. A publicityphotograph ofRucker in a similar pose, scroll in hand, ran with the caption,‘the world famous magician, master of Legerdemain, holds in his hand the papercontaining all of the magic secrets which have been hidden for centuries.’ Theimage was one of a powerful African-American reclaiming the mystical wisdomthat had for so long been withheld by the whites.Rucker was born in Amherst, Virginia, in1892. In his youth he becamefascinated by the card tricks performed by a travelling salesman of quack medicinecalled Prince Herman, whose name was presumably inspired by editions of apopular paperback book on conjuring tricks entitledHerman’s Book of Black ArtMagic Made Easy, written by the well-known American stage magician AlexanderHerrmann (1844–96).Rucker became the Prince’s assistant and on his death in1909Rucker began his own career taking the name Black Herman, and lateradopting the titles of Professor and Bachelor of Divinity. So far there was little todistinguish Black Herman from the swarms of snake oil salesmen with their boguscredentials who plied their trade around the States. It was when he branched outinto faith-healing and fortune-telling that his financial success took off. He alsobecame increasingly skilled and ambitious with regard to the tricks he performedto drum up trade. By the early1920s he was famed throughout the Midwest andliving comfortably with his wife and children in Chicago. His career and fame234|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Fig.23Seals from an early-twentieth-century pulp edition of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"advanced even further when he moved to New York where his performances atLiberty Hall, the headquarters of Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro ImprovementAssociation, sold out night after night. He loved to play on the fact that hepossessed real magical powers derived from his African ancestry. One room inhis New York home was decked out with an altar decorated with occult symbols,candles, and a human skull, and African masks hung on the walls. His success wasonly marred by a short stint in Sing Sing prison for fortune-telling. He diedperforming onstage at the Old Palace Theater, Louisville, Kentucky, in1934.10Although Joe Kay first publishedBlack Hermanfour years afterRucker’s death (wecan dismiss the Dorene claim that it was the fifteenth deluxe edition), it is possiblethat the magician wrote some of it.Rucker had some publishing experience, havingwritten a cheap how-to guide calledEasy Pocket Tricks That You Can Do.Inthelate1920s he had also funded the publication ofThe Spokesman, a short-lived monthlymagazine for New York African-Americans, in which the occasional interestingarticle punctuated acres of space devoted to promoting himself.11Some sections ofBlack Hermanread clearly like the sort of puff that quack doctors and stage magicianshad long published to promote themselves on their travels, and the preface andforeword are dated1925, New York. The section recounting the extraordinary ‘Lifeof the Great Black Herman’ smacks of familiar self-publicity. Its vaunted boasts ofgreat secrets discovered during fabled global travels follows in the footsteps of occulthucksters like CharlesRoback, thoughRucker was perhaps influenced more by thelegendary journeys of the likes of Noble Drew Ali.Black Herman’s ‘Life’ claimed he was born in the ‘dark jungles of Africa’.12Hewas possessed of ‘knowledge of hidden mysteries’ from birth, and it was foretoldthat he would grow up to be the greatest magician that ever lived. At the age of10he was taken to America by a missionary. As a young man he travelled to Cairo,‘where all the secrets of the ages are held’. He next moved on to India where hebefriended a great Hindu magician. In China he fell in with a secret society ofrobbers. He feigned his death by using his arcane knowledge of medicine, and hisfriends had his body sent in a casket to the Zulu king in Africa. People under-standably fled in fear when he appeared to return from the dead when it wasopened. After a few weeks of further amazing adventures in Africa he set sail forFrance, and then moved on to Britain for a short stay before returning to Americathe wisest magician in the world. He printed brief encomiums from the places hehad visited. London said with regret, ‘We hated to give him up,’ while Parisuttered messianically, ‘He is the first and last.’ Columbus, Ohio, was much moredown to earth in its praise: ‘It is more fun to see Herman than it is to see a barrel ofmonkeys with their tails chopped off.’13The sum total of the wisdom garnered from Herman’s extraordinary experi-ences, as revealed inSecrets of Magic-Mystery, consisted of no more than simple236|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Fig.24Black Herman: Secrets of Magic-Mystery and Legerdemain."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"sleight-of-hand tricks, basic horoscopes for each month of the year, and a guide tothe signification of dreams. It is only the poorly written final section, entitled ‘TheStory of Oriental Magic I found in the Orient an Ancient Practice: Called bysome the Magic of the Kabbara Herbologist, Mystic’, which takes us briefly intothe realms of the grimoire. It includes advice on how ‘to bring happiness tobroken lives’ by carrying the Seal of Moses in one’s pocket, and the followinginstructions on how ‘To Cross or Hex a Person: Cast a Spell—No Matter Where’:There are many different ways I gathered to do this, one of the mostpopular is to put some hemp string in the person’s path and then someOriental Gum—another way is to use some crossing powder, ConfusionDust—another way is to send them some Black Art Powder and Oil.A remedy to banish the ‘source of unhappiness’ required the reader to wash all thefloors, doors, and beds, everything in fact, with Chinese Wash and then to say thefollowing prayer every day:O! Lord, Father, King please help (name here) thy child to banishunhappiness, misery, to remove it at the source. Help me. Father, toovercome these things that hold me down. Thank you, and then tobelieve all misery banished and it will be banished.No ceremonial spirit conjuration here, and as the above extracts suggest, some ofthe spells were basically vehicles for product promotion. A recipe for gaining thelove of the opposite sex also required a pint of Chinese Wash, which was a simplecleansing scrubbing liquid containing ‘oriental gums’, lemon and ginger grass,which accrued a reputation at the time for also cleansing rooms of evil spirits andbad luck.14Another spell for ‘uncrossing friends’ required Van Van Oil, KingSolomon Oil, Dragon’s Blood, John the ConquerorRoot, and Devils ShoeString, all of which were commercial hoodoo products. Dragon’s blood, the redresin obtained from two species ofDracaenatrees found in Africa, had long beenused in Western folk medicine and magic, and in nineteenth-century England itwas commonly bought from chemists for use in love spells.15John the Con-queror, the legendary name for various roots such as jalap and galangal, whichwere marketed as powerful luck charms, was a distinctive component of theAfrican-American folk magic tradition.16This commercialization of charm production developed out of the flourishingtrade in herbs, charms, perfumes, oils, candles, and other ingredients sold bydruggists and the numerous ‘spiritual’, ‘religious’, or ‘candle’ stores that sprangup in urban African-American communities. Many such shops were merelyretailers, purchasing goods from mail order wholesalers run mostly by whites.Quite a few of these companies were offshoots of toiletry and cosmetics238|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"manufacturers already prospering by making beauty products for the African-American community. As a1920s survey of advertisements in theChicago Defenderand theNegro World, the leading African-American newspapers with a nation-wide circulation, showed, there was a huge market for skin lighteners andhair-straightening products amongst the newspaper-reading public at the time.17One such enterprise was the Valmor toiletry company of Chicago, a subsidiary ofwhich, the King Novelty Curio Company, produced a comprehensivecatalogue of charms and spiritual products during the mid-1930s. It includedseals from theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, dream books, and occult texts,along with lingerie, cosmetics, and hoodoo products.18These companies also sentsalesmen around southern African-American communities, and hired representa-tives, such as Mattie Sampson of Brownville, Georgia, who sold the products ofthe Lucky Heart Company and the Curio Products Company. One of her bestsellers was the Mystic Mojo Love Sachet.19Big strides had been made in African-American educational provision duringthe1920s and1930s, though several southern States lagged badly behind. InLouisiana, for example, over a fifth of African-Americans had no schooling atall, leading the founder of the Nation of Islam, the mysterious W. P. Fard, todenounce such obscurantism as ‘tricknollogy’, the deliberate attempt to keep thepeople enslaved through illiteracy and therefore ignorance.20In the northernStates and cities, however, literacy rates were high by the1940s. Consequentlythe press came to compete with the Church as the most important institutionalinfluence on African-American social and political opinion.21Newspapers dependheavily on advertising revenue as well as purchasers, of course, and so theChicagoDefenderand theNegro Worldalso became important facilitators in the commer-cialization of off-the-shelf magic. They provided both magical practitioners andmail order manufacturers with a cheap means of reaching potential African-American and white clients living far beyond their shops and warehouses.22Aswe saw in the last chapter, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the presshad helped generate the huge market in quack medicines and astrology, and nowin the early twentieth century the African-American press led a similar boom forhoodoo and conjure products. A trawl of five African-American newspapers overthree months in1925turned up numerous advertisements for such products as theSacred ScarabRing of the Pharoahs, which would shower riches, success, andhappiness on the wearer, the Imp-O-Luck Charm to ‘makethings comeyourway’,and the Mysto TalismanRing that ‘wards off evil spirits, sickness, spells’.African-American magic also kept pace with other commercial developments.By the1960s those Hoodoo favourites, graveyard bones, were increasingly beingsubstituted by plastic ones, while the increasing use of smoke detectors in rentalproperties led to the development of incense aerosol sprays for ritual use.23Pulp Magic|239"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Charms, grimoires, and dream books were also bought wholesale and solddirectly to clients by hoodoo workers, conjure doctors, and spiritualist preachers.In1940The New York Amsterdam-Newsestimated that in Harlem alone more than50,000people were consulting such people annually, spending nearly $1,000,000.24One of the most common reasons was to ensure success in illicit gambling, thehugely popular NumbersRacket in particular. This involved the picking of a three-digit number, the winning combination of which was picked randomly thefollowing day by such means as drawing it from the racehorse results. A wholemagical trade developed around this, just as treasure seeking had done in previouscenturies. The commercial success of John the Conqueror was due, in part, to itspurchase by gamblers. As one conjure doctor pitched: ‘Y’know, the women andthe numbers, they’s both jus’ alike. Ain’t neither of ‘em can hod out long when yuhgot Big Johnny workin’ fo’ yuh.’25Gamblers also splashed themselves all over withmagic perfumes such as Essence of Van Van (10per cent oil of lemon grass inalcohol).26If this was not enough, psalms for luck, such as those in theSecrets of thePsalms, and the fourth and114th psalm from theSixth and Seventh Books, could beemployed. The latter instructed, ‘if you desire success in your trade or business,write this Psalm with its appropriate holy name upon clean parchment, and carry itabout your person constantly in a small bag prepared especially for this purpose.’27These psalms were also sold in the form of medals and written on pieces ofparchment in red ink.On the last page ofBlack Hermanwas the following statement: ‘I am told onecan gain a Mastery over Occultism by reading and studying some of the works ofLewis de Claremont, L. W. De Laurcne, Wait, Macgrueger, Duval Spencer andYoung, and in this way can help to become an initiate.’ The reader is alreadyfamiliar with the work of Delaurence, Waite, and Macgregor, but what of deClaremont, Young, and Duval Spencer?28It is certainly curious that these are theonly three names spelt correctly, the others perhaps being unfamiliar tothe typesetter. The reason for this may have been because they were one andthe same man; someone who, it is likely, also had a hand in writing parts ofBlackHerman. It was a Mr Young who gave Joe Kay his first occult manuscriptfor publication. Young’s name was also given to a brand of Chinese Wash soldby the Oracle Products Company. The earliest occult publications of Lewis deClaremont, who was described in advertisements as ‘the famed adept’, and wasdepicted as a Hindu swami, wereThe Ancient Book of FormulasandLegends ofIncense, Herb and Oil Magic, both of which were published by Oracle. The latterbook contained sections on ‘How to fix Devil’s Shoestring’ and other productsmentioned inBlack Herman. It would appear that de Claremont was the nom deplume of Young, who was also the proprietor of the Occult Products Company.29In1940de Claremont/Young assigned the copyright of his publications over to240|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Dorene. Amongst them wereThe Seven Steps to PowerandThe7Keys to Power:The Master’s Book of Profound Esoteric Law, which contained recipes for candlemagic, benedictions against enemies, dream magic, and numerology, along withdiscourses on hypnotism and Hindu magic. They were advertised a few years lateras ‘Two of the World’s Foremost Occult Best Sellers’.30According to Ed Kay, theson of Joe Kay, Young was also the one and the same as Henri Gamache, whowrote a series of magic pulps in the1940s, which were published by SheldonPublications and marketed by Dorene, among them theMystery of the Long Lost8th,9th and10th Books of Moses(1948) and theMaster Key to Occult Secrets(1945).Gamache’sMaster Book of Candle Burninghad the most enduring influence. Oneexpert on African-American folk magic, who visited many magic shops during the1970s, found that it was for sale in every single one.31Whether Gamache and de Claremont were one and the same is open toquestion. The style and content of Gamache’s work are significantly differentfrom that of most of de Claremont’s booklets, which heaved with product plugs.32Gamache’s approach consisted of the presentation of conscientiously referencedsnippets of spells and magic culled from an eclectic mix of nineteenth- andtwentieth-century discourses on ancient Judaism, Christian, and other MiddleEastern religions, and studies of African, Indian, European, and Caribbean folk-lore.33Indeed, the subtitle of theMaster Keywas ‘A study of the survival ofprimitive customs in a modern world with sources and origins’. In the Preface heexplained how it had taken him three years to accumulate all the material. Hisreason for going to all this effort? Because ‘it presents truthfully the lengths towhich humanity will extend itself in an endeavour to gain what its heart desires.’Gamache was not disingenuous enough to claim that his motives were solelyeducational, yet neither was he ready to acknowledge that the book was intendedto be used as a grimoire; yet it was, along with theMystery of the Long Lost8th,9thand10th Books of Moses. Chapter3of the latter, entitled ‘44Secret Keys toUniversal Power’, consisted of a series of magical seals and amulets for love,recovering buried treasure, wreaking vengeance, and protection gathered fromdiverse sources. Gamache turned educational literature into magical literature,performing a sort of alchemy by taking a mish-mash of excerpts from magicaltraditions across the globe and revealing them as the universal keys to the foundingoccult wisdom of Moses.It is revealing of the cultural reach of American pulp magic that as early as1949an anthropologist researching the Carib culture in British Honduras, now knownas Belize, referred to the influence there and in neighbouring countries ofTheSeven Keys to Power,The Secrets of the Psalms, andThe Ten Lost Books of theProphets.34In Jamaica, and elsewhere in the Caribbean where the Delaurenceoeuvre had been banned in1940, the de Claremont and Gamache books filled thePulp Magic|241"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"vacuum.35During the second half of the1940s a Kingston mail order company,Spencer’s Advertising Service and Commission Agency, regularly advertised thefull range of Gamache and de Claremont publications in theDaily Gleaner, alongwithSecrets of Psalmsand theLong Lost Friend, all of which were available fromDorene.36A survey of the books sold by Kingston drugstores half a centurylater found that they consisted almost exclusively of dream books and theworks of Gamache and de Claremont.37They never achieved the mythic statusof Delaurence, but their works were seen as being more accessible. As aMontserrat ‘scientist’ explained, ‘Sixth and Seventh Books of Mosesdo not helpmuch. Help only a master or adept. The naı ̈ve medium not able to operate thatbook. They useBlack Hermanor theSeven Steps to Powerand theSeven Keys toPower.’38The Hispanic marketDorene also turned an eye to the burgeoning Hispanic market, producing aSpanish translation of de Claremont’sLegends of Incense, Herb and Oil Magicin1938.39The decision to do this may have been triggered by the evident growth ofthe PuertoRican population in New York, the area of East Harlem in particular.During the1920s it had been a predominantly Italian district, the biggest inAmerica, with a large Jewish community as well, but in the1930s many movedout while increasing numbers of African-Americans and Hispanics, mostly PuertoRicans, moved in.40The sound of Spanish voices became a familiar sound on thestreets of northern cities for the first time.Bota ́nicaswere and are key institutions in PuertoRico’s tradition of folkmedicine, selling not only herbs but also Catholic sacramentals, incense, candles,oils, statues, and representations of the saints, along with charms and grimoires—in other words, all the ritual paraphernalia required by adherents ofEspiritismoandSanteri ́a.41As One PuertoRicanbota ́nicashop owner in1960s Chicago reported,most of her business was not concerned with drugstore medicines for naturalailments, but ‘supplies to people affected withbrujeria[witchcraft]’. Anotherimportant sideline for her were products such as incense and bath herbs topromote luck, particularly for the numbers.42Probably the first High Streetbota ́nicato be set up in America was that established in East Harlem in1921by aGuatemalan named AlbertoRendo ́n. He had worked in a drugstore and noticedhow many African Americans and West Indians came to purchase herbal remed-ies, bath oils, and powders for magical purposes. So he opened the West IndiesBotanical Garden, selling his own herbal products, some of which were based onplants sent to him especially from PuertoRico. As the ethnic balance of the area242|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"changedRendo ́n shifted the focus of his product range from the hoodoo andObeahrequirements of his black customers to those of the followers of CentralAmericanEspiritismo. The store’s name was consequently changed to Bota ́nica.43Over the next few decades, as Hispanic immigration increased, particularly withthe huge exodus from Cuba as a consequence of the CubanRevolution of1959,bota ́nicasspread across the United States.44By1970there were at least twenty-fivein Chicago, and in the past couple of decades they have become particularlypopular in the Southwest of the USA, with several hundred stores in SouthernCalifornia alone.45The Mexican magical healing tradition ofcurandismohas been practised in thesouthern USA for much longer, and in the mid-twentieth century folkloristsand anthropologists commented on how it had remained largely impervious toEuropean-American influence. It was not completely free of it though. The lureof foreign occult secrets was irresistible to some. In the1970s a Texancuranderopractitioner attempted to impress one researcher by showing him ‘two books onwitchcraft, which he would not let me touch. Since he could not read English, heshowed us pictures from the books, commenting on each.’ Anothercurandero,eager to impress, read some passages from the Bible and a bilingual edition ofMary Baker Eddy’sScience and Health with Key to the Scriptures.46It is true, though,that the North American grimoire tradition had less impact in Mexico and otherCentral American countries than it did in the Caribbean. A major reason for this isthat Spanish grimoire publishing kept apace.Between the two World Wars several editions of theLibro de San Ciprianowereproduced by publishers in Barcelona and Madrid, and Portuguese versions inLisbon.47These could be ordered by overseas customers of course, but duringthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was a huge migration ofSpaniards to the Americas. Between1900and1924some five million left, headingmainly for Argentina and Cuba, though3.8million returned home. Around one-third of the emigrants were Galicians, and another20per cent came fromneighbouring Leon and Asturias.48These were, of course, the northwesternregions where theLibro de San CiprianoorCiprianillotradition was strongest andsome emigrants must have brought copies with them. Ethnographers studying thereligious cultures of Cuba during the first few decades of the twentieth centuryfound theLibro San Ciprianohad been adopted bySanteri ́apractitioners, and wasbeing sold along with editions of the main French grimoires.49Judging from acopy found on a wizard imprisoned by the Sa ̃o Paulo authorities in1904,Portuguese migrants also brought copies with them.50Under Franco’s regime occult publications were effectively suppressed inSpain, and it was only from the late1970s onwards that a new wave of editionspoured off the Spanish presses.51In the meantime Spanish language grimoirePulp Magic|243"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Fig.25La Magia Suprema Negra(1916)."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"production shifted decisively to Latin America.52Buenos Aires, the principalpost-war publishing centre in the region, and also the home to hundreds ofthousands of Galicians, was one source of grimoires. As early as1916a limitededition Solomonic work entitledLa Magia Suprema Negrawas produced there,though its stated place of publication wasRome. Its equally spurious author wasthe legendary tenth-century monk Jonas Sufurino, finder of theLibro de SanCipriano.53The man who supposedly translated it from the German and editedit was the mysterious Dr Moorne. An early-twentieth-century catalogue of cheapoccult publications produced by the Madrid publishers Librerı ́a de Pueyo showsthat Dr Moorne was cited as the translator of a raft of cheap magic books at thetime, few of which now survive, such asEl Libro de Simo ́n el Mago(2pesetas), and ajoint Spanish edition of theEnchirideonandGrimoire de Pape Honorius(6pesetas).54It was in South America, though, that his name became most well known,particularly in Argentina. This was not only due to the grimoires he purportedlytranslated, but also for a long-running, successful set of Tarot cards attributed tohim,El Supremo Arte de Echar Las Cartas, which were first published around the1930s and sold far and wide by peddlers.It is possible that the earliest South American edition of theLivro de Sa ̃oCiprianowas produced in neighbouring Brazil. A Sa ̃o Paulo publisher advertiseda booklet for sale in1916entitledO Verdadeiro e\u0002U ltimo Livro de Sa ̃o Cipriano(TheTrue and Last Book of Saint Ciprian).55Dr Moorne’sMagia Naturalwas certainlypublished there in1928, testifying to the pre-war origins of Brazil’s occultpublishing industry. It was in the1960s, though, that the first mass-market editionsof theLivro de Sa ̃o Ciprianowere printed in the country. By the1990s publishers inRio and Sa ̃o Paulo had put out at least seventeen different editions.56Somecontinued to reprint the lists of buried treasures to be found in Portugal andGalicia.57Treasure was probably not uppermost in the minds of most purchasersof theLivro de Sa ̃o Cipriano. Many were and are followers ofUmbanda, a hetero-dox, protean religion based around a pantheon of spirits including Yoruba deities,and the spirits of native Indians and slaves. It emerged in the1920s, growing out ofCandomble ́, folk Catholicism, Kardecism, and spiritualism, and spread rapidly fromthe mid-century onwards in the country’s industrial centres.58TheLivro de Sa ̃oCiprianowas added to the mix and became a popular seller for theRio de Janeirooccult publisher Editora Espiritualista, which, from the1950s, produced a range ofbooks on magic and spiritualism for those interested in or initiated intoUmbanda.59It is likely that it was these Latin American editions of theLibro de San Cipriano,rather than the earlier Spanish ones, that leached into the indigenous Indianmagical traditions in some regions of South America. In the1970s the anthro-pologist Michael Taussig found itinerant Putumayo Indian magical healers sellingPulp Magic|245"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"a version of theLibro de San Cipriano, along with roots, barks, sulphur, andmirrors, in their street stalls in the southern Colombian town of Puerto Tejada.One copy he saw was ascribed to Jonas Surfurino and contained ‘The Clavicule ofSolomon, Pacts of Exorcism, TheRed Dragon and the Infernal Goat, the BlackHen, School of Sorcery, The Great Grimorio and the Pact of Blood’. ThePutumayo were thought by the dominant Hispanic population of the region tobe adepts in the healing arts and deep in both good and bad magic—a reputationthat they understandably exploited commercially.60In the1980s theLibro de SanCiprianowas similarly found to be a significant component of the famed healingpractices of the Bolivian Kallawaya. Since at least the eighteenth century theKallawaya, who live on the eastern slopes of the Andes near the Peruvian border,have been consulted from far and wide for their herbal and magical knowledge.Some of the tribe continue to make a living as itinerant practitioners, bringingtheir herbs, stones, and amulets with them. Not only do they consult the contentsof theLibro de San Cipriano, the book itself is imbued with purifying qualities.61During the second half of the twentieth century Mexico City was probably themost active and influential centre of pulp grimoire production in Latin America.62A survey of the cheap books on magic and divination sold by peddlers in twoPeruvian towns in1967revealed Mexican titles such asLa Magia Negra,La MagiaBlanca, andLa MagiaRoja.63In1976a Mexican publisher produced the first LatinAmerican edition of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses. It was apparently atranslation of one of the US editions and had a print run of5,000.64Copies ofthese Mexican grimoires became a staple product forbota ́nicasandyerberiasacrossCentral and South America, and in southern US towns with large Hispanicpopulations like Tucson, Arizona.65In the past few years a new generation ofMexican pulp spell books with cheap-looking garish covers have appeared, such asBrujerii ́a: hechizos, conjuros y encantamientosandBrujeria a la Mexicana. These also sellwell across the border and can be purchased mail order from the likes of IndioProducts, one of the biggest mystical supplies companies in the States, founded byMartin Mayer in1991. Mayer’s aunt and uncle had run a hoodoo drugstore inChicago’s South Side during the1920s.66The cultural influence of Mexican magical commerce in the USA is alsoevident in the recent growth of the Catholic folk cult ofSanti ́sima Muerte(HolyDeath), which some of the recent Mexican pulp grimoires promote. The image ofthe spirit of the Holy Death is that of a robed female skeleton. Because of thismacabre image she is associated with evil by some, and is seen as the patroness ofMexican drug lords. Yet in Mexican folk religion theSanta Muertehas alsobecome an intercessionary patroness, resorted to by ‘good’ Catholics as well asthose seeking to inflict harm.67The creators of spiritual products have been quickto adopt the striking image, using it to market prayer cards, Holy Death incense246|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"sprays, and the like, supplanting that of the Hindu Swami popular on earlierhoodoo product labels. It is through thebota ́nicasthat she has also been incorp-orated by some into the pantheon ofSanteri ́a, which has become increasinglypopular amongst Mexicans. A few years ago the Bishop of Leo ́n called on theMexican government to suppress a newly created independent church,La IglesiaCato ́lica Tradicional Mex-Usa, dedicated to the worship of theSanta Muerte. Thegrowth of the cult in Southern California and Arizona has also led to expressionsof concern regarding the influence ofyerberi ́asandbota ́nicasand their merchan-dise.68The war against grimoires in GermanyIt was in Germany, though, that the publication of cheap grimoires proved mostcontentious. Esotericism flourished in early-twentieth-century Germany andAustro-Hungary. As in England, America, and France, there was considerablemiddle-class interest in spiritualism, ancient religions, mystical belief systems, andritual magic.69Theosophy was particularly popular and gave birth to the spiritualistAnthroposophy movement ofRudolf Steiner. By1912there were also thirty-threeMazdaznan branches in Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Switzerland. Leipzigbecame the cult’s second home outside of Chicago. Numerous homegrown groupssprung up. A few years before the First World War theOrdo Novi Templi, whichclaimed an occult inheritance from the Templars, was founded by the Austrianright-wing anti-Semite, Jo ̈rg Lanz von Liebenfels. He was a follower of themystical, Aryan supremacist doctrine of his fellow Austrian, the writer and runol-ogist Guido von List (1848–1919). Their racist philosophy of a supreme Teutoniclife force, known as Ariosophy, later fed into Nazi racial ideology. Another societythat claimed a Templar heritage was theOrdo Templi Orientis(OTO), whoseovertly magical philosophy was based, they said, on Eastern mysticism, andMasonic and hermetic secrets. Aleister Crowley set up a branch in England. Thewritings of E ́liphas Le ́vi were an undoubted influence, as was BeverleyRandolph’sconception of sex magic—a strong theme in German ritual magic.This esoteric boom generated a thriving occult publishing industry. In1906theGerman Theosophical Society set up their own publishing house in Leipzig,which produced not only theosophical works but also astrological periodicalsand books.70The list of the Berlin publisher Herman Barsdorf Verlag containeda mix of erotic books and texts on ancient magic, including translations of theworks of Francois Lenormant. Its most impressive occult publishing venture wasthe five-volumeMagische Werke(Magic Works)(1921), which included editionsof theHeptameron, Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy, and theArbatel.

By the1930s BaumVerlag had become a major force in occult publishing with a series of titles onmodernRosicrucianism and books such as theHandbuch Der Astromagie(1926).One of Baum’s most prolific authors was G. W. Surya, the nom de plume of theoccultist Demeter Georgievitz-Weitzer (1873–1949), who before the First WorldWar was editor of the popular esoteric magazineZentralblatt fu ̈r Okkultismus, andwho later wrote guides onRosicrucianism, medicine, and alchemy. Equallyprolific was an intriguing character named Franz Sa ̈ttler (b.1884), an expert onArabic dialect and founder of the Adonistic Society, a sex-magic group formed in1925. Under the pseudonym Dr Musallam, he wrote a series of publications forthe Berlin publisher Bartels on astrology, chiromancy, magic, and necromancy,which collectively came to be known as theZauberbibelorBible of Magic.72During the first two decades of the twentieth century Bartels was the mainproducer of grimoires in Germany, reprinting versions of works culled mainlyfrom Scheible’sDas Kloster. It published several large compilations of between500and700pages including theRomanusbu ̈chlein,Der wahrhaftige feurige Drache, and theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses.73Bartels was also responsible for the introductionto a wider audience ofDas Buch Jezira, described as the ‘Big Book of the MosesBooks’. The title was borrowed from theSefer Jezirah, but its contents consisted ofthe eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth books of Moses. In1917it wasnoted that a Munich bookshop was selling numerous copies of this publication towomen, probably wives and mothers seeking protective magical aid for theirhusbands and sons in the trenches.74Bartels also sold cheaper single editions of theEighth and Ninth Books of Moses, as did other publishers such as Max WendelsVerlag in Dresden and Hu ̈lsmann Verlag in Leipzig. It was sales of theSixthand Seventh Books of Moses, though, that far outstripped the other grimoires inGermany. During the1920s and early1930s at least five publishers were producingeditions, most with Philadelphia as the place of publication.75It was presumably one of these editions that police found amongst spiritualistbooks in the house of Fritz Angerstein, the director of a cement works near248|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Siegen, Westphalia, who in1924murdered eight members of his household withan axe, including his wife. She was a devout Pietist who had apparently miscarriedseveral times. These influences no doubt contributed to the morbid premonitionsshe experienced, and which played on her husband.76Rumour would later have itthat Angerstein was inspired by the hope of activating a seal said to be contained inone edition of theSixth and Seventh Books ofMoses, which would provide greatriches to anyone who killed nine people. The case attracted press attention aroundthe world, and he was beheaded in November1925. As well as the occultconnection, the case was also notable as one of the last in which the authoritiestook seriously the notion that the violent last moments of the murdered wereimprinted on the retina for a short time afterwards. Local police took photographsof the eyes of one of Angerstein’s victims after someone in the morgue said theysaw the image of Angerstein with a raised axe in the eyes of the corpse.77During the WeimarRepublic and the ThirdReich there were at least seven-teen court cases in Germany involving the belief in witchcraft, some of whichinvolved the ‘Moses Books’.78A report on one trial in the town of Stade in1931commented that spell books were to be found in many houses in the area. When,in1935, an old couple in the Black Forest complained of being plagued by witchesand ghosts, they hired two men from the town of Haslach who tried to rid thehouse of evil influences by reading invocations from theSixth and Seventh Books ofMoses.79Most such cases seem to have been prosecuted under the general laws forfraud, but the authorities in Bavaria were particularly well equipped to deal withthe occult arts. Article54of the Bavarian police code allowed for the imprison-ment of those who practised magic, spirit conjuring, and divination for profit. Justafter the end of the First World War the military authorities in Bavaria extendedthis clause to punish those who lectured on such subjects without having anyscientific qualifications.80Numerous sensational and dubious claims have been made regarding theinfluence of occultism on Hitler and the architects of the ThirdReich. Therecertainly were prominent Nazis who had an active interest in various aspects ofthe occult, most notably Himmler,Rudolf Hess, andSS-Oberfu ̈hrerKarl MariaWiligut, who, influenced by the work of Guido von List, developed his ownmystic ‘key’ to the meaning of runes.81From the beginning of the ThirdReich,however, the authorities were concerned that occult philosophies could under-mine popular confidence in the supremacy and glorious destiny of theReich.A recent authoritative study has rightly stressed that the Nazis’ ‘selective affinityfor occultism was dwarfed by the enormity of their regime’s hostility to the occultmovement more generally’.82Predictions and prophecies had long been exploited by rulers for politicalpropaganda purposes, but they had to be strictly controlled; otherwise, theyPulp Magic|249"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"could unsettle and sow fear amongst the populace. The Nazi authorities decidedthat the balancing act was not worth it. In the autumn of1933the police in Berlin,Hanover, and Cologne ordered newspapers to cease accepting advertisements forastrologers. The following year, the Berlin police banned the sale and productionof astrological periodicals and almanacs. Booksellers’ stocks were confiscated.83The next step was to suppress the wider occult community. Individuals weretargeted—people like Eugen Grosche, a Berlin bookseller and founder of theFraternitas Saturni, whose private library was seized by the Gestapo.84In July1937an official decree outlawed Freemasonry, occult societies, and religious sects likethe Christian Scientists throughout the country. The extent to which theseclampdowns affected provincial publishers is not clear, though the occultpublishers Baum Verlag andRegulus Verlag of Go ̈rlitz, which published bookson astrology and Nostradamus, evidently continued to operate until June1941when the authorities rounded up occultists of all shades, closed down all occultpublishing houses, and confiscated publications.85The trigger for this purge wasthe propaganda embarrassment of Hess’s bizarre flight to Scotland, which Goeb-bels portrayed as the actions of a man unhinged by his association with astrologersand seers. A line was drawn in the sand, and occultism would no longer be a publicissue in Nazi Germany.During the ThirdReich the authorities were concerned not only with forms ofmass-market divination but also the esoteric belief systems embraced by themiddle classes and urban blue-collar workers. Occult philosophies came to beseen as antagonistic to the shared ideology being forged by the Nazi regime.When, in the autumn of1937the SS newspaperDas Schwarze Korpsprinted aseries of articles on the danger ofAberglaube(superstition), which it typicallyblamed on Jews and the Catholic Church, the focus was on the evils of spiritu-alism and astrology.86The world of rural folk magic slipped under the radar: thiswas ‘superstition’ that had no philosophical or organized framework and thereforeposed no threat to Nazi hegemony. Cunning-folk were periodically prosecuted,but no more so than in Weimar or Imperial Germany. The ThirdReich was,nevertheless, hardly a propitious time to publish popular grimoires—particularlytheSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswith its pseudo-Hebraic characters.87Neither did the academic study of ‘traditional’ magical beliefs seem to attractthe same opprobrium as intellectual occultism. Indeed, Himmler’s interest in theidea that the witch trials were a Church-inspired crime against the German peopleled to the formation of theH-Sonderkommandounit, a team of around eightresearchers employed to find and catalogue early modern witch prosecutions inGerman-language archives.88Regarding contemporary folk beliefs, the Nazisenthusiastically promoted the academic respectability of GermanVolkskunde(folklore), funding research and creating the first professorial chair in the subject250|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"in1933. Nazi support for folklore research came at a price of course. Thediscipline was partly under the brief of Himmler’s SS Office of Ancestral Inher-itance, and partly under the supervision and control of AlfredRosenberg, one ofthe architects of the Nazis’ racial policies and Hitler’s supervisor for ‘All Intellec-tual and Worldview Schooling and Education’. Folklore had to have a purposebeyond mere scholarly interest. If folklorists wanted to be sponsored they had towork for the good of the National Socialist message, legitimating Nazi racialtheories and promoting the purity and nobility of ‘true’ Nordic-German tradi-tions, folktales, and rural cultures.89Those who did not display sufficient enthu-siasm for the Nazi ‘project’ were swiftly unseated from their chairs. One of thosewho prospered was Adolf Spamer, a Nazi party member and director of theRegionalResearch Office for Folklore in theReich Union Folk-Nation andHomeland. He also happened to be the leading expert on German folk grimoires.In1907the German Union of Folklorist Associations agreed to organize thecreation of a Collection of German Formulae for Charms and Incantations. Thiswas inspired, in part, by the collection of German manuscript charms, celestialletters, and magic manuscripts gathered by Albrecht Dieterich, an eminent experton ancient Egyptian magic who was also fascinated by German folk magic. It wasno doubt also inspired by the publication in1902of the pioneering assemblage ofNordic manuscript grimoires and charms by the Norwegian clergyman andpolitician Anton Christian Bang.90Spamer was instrumental in getting theUnion’s project underway, and in1914published anAppeal to Collect GermanFormulaeto German, Swiss, and Austrian folklore associations. Over the next fewdecades he personally accumulated a comprehensive collection of publishedgrimoires and manuscripts.91Spamer’s ambitious ideas for German folklore research and willingnessto cooperate withRosenberg’s bureau meant that by1936he had been elevatedto Professor of Folklore at Berlin University, and was described by one colleagueas ‘the Pope ofVolkskunde’. Yet in1938he fell out of favour due, in part, toscholarly differences with another influential folklorist more closely associatedwithRosenberg’s agenda.92Ill health further inhibited his work during the early1940s. His fortunes improved soon after the war, though, when he became thefirst academic folklorist to be appointed inRussian-controlled East Germany,becoming Professor ofVolkskundeat the Technical University of Dresden. Hispassion for folk magic resurfaced publicly and led to the establishment of theCorpus of German Formulae for Charms and Incantations. In1949he gave alecture on magic books and spells to the German Academy of Sciences, and by thetime of his death in1954the Corpus collection housed an impressive22,000items. Some of the fruits of his research on grimoires were collated in abook tracking the bibliographical history of theRomanusbu ̈chleinin which hePulp Magic|251"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"meticulously traced the origins of nineteen of the charm formulae it contained.A posthumous article on magic books also appeared, which recorded the lettersreceived between1925and1935by a Dresden publisher of grimoires, revealingthe popular demand for instruction on practical magic.93For some, the cleansing of the curse of Nazism also required the rationalizing ofGerman society. The enthusiasm for occultism in the early twentieth century wasviewed as a contributor to theSonderweg, or special path that the course ofGermany history took in its development into a racist totalitarian state.94So, inpost-war Germany, middle-class occultism, alternative medicine, and folk magicwere seen by some as an obstacle to the forging of a new social and moralenlightenment. There was a raft of court cases involving witch belief and magicin post-war Germany. This has been interpreted by historians as a result ofincreased witchcraft accusations arising from general economic and social instabil-ity, and related to the large number of single women returning to rural commu-nities after the war.95From a contemporary perspective it was confirmation of the‘superstitious’ darkness that had flourished during the ThirdReich. For anti-superstition crusaders the two main pillars upholding the edifice of superstitionwere the influence ofHexenbanners(witch doctors) and the dissemination ofoccult literature prior to and after the ThirdReich.For several years after the war the German publishing industry was under-standably in bad shape. Paper and ink were in short supply and the transportnetwork badly damaged. The two major centres of German publishing, Berlin andLeipzig, had suffered from Allied bombing. Currency reform also led to furthershort-term hardship and a shortage of money. In Soviet-controlled Germanypublishing houses were either nationalized or forced out of business. One conse-quence of the blow to the old established publishing industry was the expansion ofpublishing in West German provincial centres such as Stuttgart and Hamburg.Although Allied authorities in western Germany banned the writings of promin-ent Nazis, censorship was not heavy-handed and only in the French sector werepublishers required to submit manuscripts for inspection.96The ThirdReich and occupation forces aside, democratic Germany had itsown strong tradition of censoringSchund(trashy) andSchmutz(dirty) publica-tions—in other words pulp literature, which was considered deleterious toGermany’s youth and therefore the future of the nation.97In1926the Weimargovernment had instituted a law concerned with identifying and blacklistingcheap and easily available books and magazines that glamorized violence and sexor offended public decency. However, due in part to excessive bureaucracy thelaw largely failed in its aims, with the exception perhaps of pornography. TheNazis were, of course, far more successful in controlling popular literature,ensuring the format was used to spread Arian political aspirations. In post-war252|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Germany the old worries over corrupted youth returned. The concern was notonly with the lingering influence of Nazi indoctrination, but also the growth ofAmerican cultural imperialism. The influence of American pulp magazines anddetective and western serials had already been a concern in Weimar Germany, butnow the floodgates were fully open. This was not just a German fear. At the sametime a similar vociferous campaign against the tide of American pulp also rose inCanada, with talk of the country becoming an open sewer for what some saw as itsneighbour’s cultural filth.98Now the political, anti-capitalist sentiments of the WeimarRepublic werereplaced by a resurgent influence of religious organizations in politics and society.In1953a new statute was passed against publications that endangered the moralsof the German youth. Between1954and1956a series of private initiatives, usuallyorchestrated by religious organizations, led to the setting up of public collectionpoints where trash literature could be swapped for morally improving juvenileliterature. Despite acute awareness of the book-burning predilections of the Naziauthorities, several pyres of offensive publications were publicly burned orburied.99Hard-boiled detective novels and pornography were the main preoccu-pation of the moral crusaders but popular literature that encouraged ‘superstition’was also deemed fit for the flames.The words ‘Schund’ and ‘Schmutz’ may not have found their way into the1953law, but they were at the heart of the criticisms of one of the most vocalcampaigners against theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, the respected Austrianforensic doctor Otto Prokop. In an article written in the early1960s he thought itpertinent to list the range of ‘trashy’ lifestyle books of what he called the ‘cynical’Schmutzliteraturpublishers who printed editions of the Moses Books.100One ofthose he mentioned was the Brunswick publishing house Planet-Verlag. This wasone of the provincial publishers that had been quick to take advantage of the newrealities of post-war Germany, exploiting the undoubted thirst for cheap, escapistpopular literature. It specialized in guides for women on how to look young,remain desirable, and achieve the perfect bust.101More controversially, since thewar, it had been re-publishing the pulp science-fiction tales of Paul AlfredMueller, who also wrote under the noms de plume Freder van Holk and LokMyler. Mueller’s tales of futuristic, Arian scientific enterprise and colonization ofAtlantis were hugely popular in Nazi Germany. It was this uncomfortable asso-ciation that led Planet-Verlag to discontinue the re-editions in1953, in anticipa-tion of the imminent censorship law.102It was not the peddling of rip-roaringArian fantasies that landed the publisher in court, however, but rather accusationsof fostering pernicious magical beliefs. In1950, it had printed9,000copies of ahardback version of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses. This was not a version ofthe Scheible edition with its numerous pseudo-Hebraic sigils and amulets, but wasPulp Magic|253"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"nevertheless controversial due to its advice on making a pact with the Devil. Ninethousand was a sizeable print run for the time and Planet-Verlag was obviouslyconfident it could sell them in large numbers. In other words they were aware ofthe thirst for practical magic in post-war Germany. Not long after it also broughtout an edition ofDas Buch Jezirato capitalize on their initial success.In1954the German Society for Protection against Superstition, or DEGESA(Deutsche Gesellschaft Schutz vor Aberglauben), was founded. As one member put it,the Society was dedicated to combating ‘the commercial exploitation of super-stition’.103It acted as a network for a diverse bunch of campaigners againstgrimoires and their influence. There was Will Emrich, a former president of theGerman Animal Protection League, who believed theSixth and Seventh Books ofMoseshad led to the painful deaths of numerous cats, chickens, moles, and toads byfollowers of its magical cures.104Herbert Scha ̈fer was more concerned with thesocial consequences. He was a criminologist for the West German federal police,who examined the files of ninety-five court cases involving witchcraft beliefsbetween1925and1956, and twenty-nine legal actions against magical healersbetween1947and1955. He found theSixth and Seventh Books of Moseswasmentioned in20per cent of the cases. Amongst them was that of ahexenbannerin southern Germany who, since1941, had been offering to remove evil fromfarmers’ cattle sheds with the help of his ‘Moses books’.105The Jesuit priestPhilipp Schmidt concentrated on the religious and moral threat posed bygrimoires. In1956he published a book on the evils of magic past and present inwhich he exaggeratedly stated that magic books had played their part in nearly allthe recent cases of witchcraft and magic heard by the German courts. Theyaccounted for the ‘almost uniform methods and practices of the ‘‘unwitchers’’ ’,he asserted, and they were ‘calculated to have a pernicious effect on simple mindsand on uncritical, credulous persons’.106In1960another Catholic author,Dr Herbert Auhofer, published a book on the subject,Aberglaube und Hexenwahnheute(Superstition and the Witch-craze Today), which was apparently officiallypraised by the Catholic Church.All these authors fulsomely applauded one man who had pioneered thecampaign, a man whom Aufhofer said had ‘preached to deaf ears’ for four decadesand had been unfairly portrayed as a monomaniac for his earnest endeavour.107That man was the retired Hamburg schoolteacher Johann Kruse (1889–1983). As afarmer’s son brought up in Brickeln, Schleswig-Holstein, he had heard peoplebeing accused of witchcraft and seen the suffering and torment it had caused.Indeed, his own mother was also slandered, leading to much family anxiety.While most critical attention was focused on the popularity of spiritualism,theosophy, and other middle-class esoteric interests, Kruse began to wage a lonelycampaign against the old, deeply engrained magical traditions rooted in rural254|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Fig.26The1950Planet-Verlag edition of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"German society.108In1923he published a book on the subject entitledHexen-wahn in der Gegenwart(Witch-craze in the Present). He was infuriated by thecomplacency of folklorists, educationalists, and the clergy for treating witchcraftbeliefs as mere folklore and not a serious social menace. It was in the1930s that heseriously began to mount a national campaign. Although this fitted quite well withNazi ideas about the pernicious influence of ecclesiastical ‘superstition’, Kruse wasno ardent participant in the ThirdReich, and although not actively opposed to theregime he was nevertheless sufficiently lacking in enthusiasm for it to cause himsome personal trouble. Kruse’s ire was chiefly directed at the thousands ofhexenbannerwho made large amounts of money by defrauding those who thoughtthey were bewitched, and who caused untold suffering to those accused ofwitchcraft. In1950he founded his own Archive for the Investigation of Con-temporary Witchcraft Superstition. The following year he published a book basedon his extensive collection of cases entitledHexen unter uns?(Witches Among Us?),in which he toned down the anti-clericalism of his earlier work. It was his legalchallenge to grimoires a few years later, though, that would make him a figure ofinternational interest.Planet-Verlag placed numerous adverts in popular magazines and newspapersfor what was the first widely available German edition of the grimoire for twentyyears. The impact of this advertising campaign was evident at the trial, in1951,ofahexenbannernamed Wilhelm Lu ̈hr of Ebersdorf. In defending his trade, whichconcerned the selling of celestial letters, Lu ̈hr told the judge that theSixth andSeventh Book of Moseswas ‘openly allowed in the book-trade, and daily extolled inmany newspapers and illustrated magazines’.109In1952the influence of theseadvertisements came to Kruse’s attention and a new front of his campaign against‘superstition’ opened up. The following year he denounced the Planet-Verlagedition, alleging that the title page’s claim to be a ‘Philadelphia’ imprint wasfraudulent, and, more importantly, that its magical contents was a public menacethat could potentially encourage murder.110In1956he took the bold step of suingthe publisher.Kruse’s star expert witness at the trial was Otto Prokop. In his mid-thirties, thehigh-flying doctor had become a lecturer at the Forensic Medicine Institute atBonn University in1953, and in early1957he was appointed the manager of theInstitute of Judicial Medicine at Humboldt University in East Berlin. Prokopseems to have first come into contact with Kruse in1954via a mutual acquaint-ance keen to help build on the network of anti-superstition activists fostered byDEGESA.111As well as his innovative work in forensic science, Prokop hadalready proved himself an ardent campaigner against magical and spiritual medi-cine, lecturing on the subject at university and later in several publications. Hedenounced alternative medicines such as homeopathy and acupuncture as256|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"superstitious, and during his long career he was frequently involved in court casesagainst spiritualist healers and other practitioners of alternative medicine.112He,not surprisingly, shared Kruse’s disgust for the magical practices of German folkmedicine, and saw the suppression of theSixth and Seventh Booksas a positive steptowards eradicating ‘unscientific’, ‘irrational’ medicine.Planet-Verlag produced its own star academic to counter the Prokop effect—the well-known professor of folklore at Go ̈ttingen University, Will-ErichPeuckert (1895–1969). At the time of the trial Peuckert’s reputation was at itspeak. Only a year earlier aFestschrifthad been published to honour his sixtiethbirthday, with congratulatory signatures from leading folklorists from acrossEurope and America. He had not always been in such favour, however.Like Kruse, Peuckert began his career as a provincial schoolteacher. Broughtup in the mountainous region of Silesia on the German–Czech border, hisindustrious research on the popular traditions and beliefs of the region led himto a career in academia and a post at the University of Breslau. During the1920sand1930s he wrote a series of books on early modern occult philosophy andmysticism, such asBo ̈hme(1924) andDieRosenkreutzer(1928). His most ambitiousbook wasPansophie(1936), which concerned the development of natural anddemonic intellectual magic during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Peuckertwas labelled as ‘politically unreliable’ by the Nazi authorities and was stripped ofhis post. He retired to the Silesian mountains from where he continued to researchand publish. Untainted by Nazi associations he was the first professor to beassigned an academic folklore position in post-war West Germany, and was aleading figure in the soul-searching debate that took place amongst folkloristsregarding their discipline’s role during the ThirdReich, and how it shoulddevelop in light of its recent history.113Peuckert had a deep understanding of the historical and cultural significance ofgrimoires. In1954he had published an article on theEgyptischen Geheimnisseandshortly after the Planet-Verlag trial the fruits of his research on theSixth andSeventh Books of Mosesalso appeared.114His reputation was such that, like Kruse,the magic-believing public saw him not only as a scholar of the subject but also askilful worker of counter-witchcraft.115He received letters from distraughtpeople asking him to unbewitch them and provide love potions. One farmerfrom a remote village in the wild Lu ̈neburger Heath, north of Braunschweig,wrote to him that his cows were bewitched and that reading the Bible in thecowshed at midnight had failed to remove the spell upon them. Instead of givingthe man a lecture on the fallacy of believing in witchcraft, as Kruse might havedone, Peuckert visited the man and seeing that the stalls were filthy, he said,‘Witches hate light and air and cleanliness; clean the place out and they will go.’116Pulp Magic|257"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"His support for Planet-Verlag was based, in part, on the historical perspectivethat theSixth and Seventh Books of Mosesprovided a fascinating insight into theorigin and reformulation of magical traditions over the centuries. From a folklor-ist’s point of view, furthermore, it had been an important influence on ruralGerman folk magic for over a century—part of a valuable tradition that should beunderstood and preserved, not condemned and suppressed. The prosecutionaccused him of romanticizing ignorance and credulity.117Peuckert was also,perhaps, motivated by professional pique. How dare an amateur like Kruse anda scientist such as Prokop assume expertise on a subject that was the preserve ofhistorians and folklorists?Peuckert’s enthusiasm for finding value in old magical remedies was most graph-ically demonstrated by his experiments with hallucinogenic plants, which garneredinternational attention in the press a few years later. In1960the65-year-oldacademic published a brief account of how he and a lawyer friend had concoctednumerous narcotic potions based on early modern magical remedies and spells. Heoccasionally tried some of these out on himself, most notably a witches’ ointmentdescribed in della Porta’sMagia Naturalis.Heandhisfriendrubbedsomeoftheointment into their skin and soon entered an hallucinatory alternative world. Formore than a day and a night they dreamed of wild aerial rides and participated inorgies with grotesque creatures. For Peuckert it was proof that some of those whosaid they had been to Sabbats were influenced by their drug-induced alternativerealities.118As a newspaper report explained, ‘Peuckert’s research has convinced himthat there is a scientific basis for many things associated with witchcraft.’119But let usreturn to the rather more sober environment of the Braunschweig magistrates’ court,where, in November1956the trial came to a head.Peuckert’s testimony failed to convince the lower court, which agreed withProkop’s contention that the Moses book was harmful and ‘a danger to the generalpublic’.120The owners of Planet-Verlag were fined9,000deutschmarks andrequired to withdraw the remaining stock and the printing plates. They appealed,and in September the following year the two sides were once again back in courtand in even bitterer mood. Kruse and Prokops garnered the support of PhilipSchmidt and other members of DEGESA. Peuckert was in acerbic form denoun-cing Kruse’s opinions, his book, and his ‘useless’ archive. The appeals courtrescinded the decision, though legal proceedings rumbled on for another threeyears with the higher court launching an investigation as to whether thepublisher’s advertisements regarding the origin and contents of the Moses Bookshad deceived those lured into buying it. Several purchasers were persuaded to givetestimony, such as the farmer and mechanic who recounted how he had seen amagazine advertisement for theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, in which it wasstated that it contained valuable old remedies for curing people and animals. He258|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"ordered a copy, but on reading it soon realized he could have saved himself somemoney, as it was merely a ‘catchpenny publication’. He showed it to a localveterinarian who agreed it was worthless, and so his wife burned it.121Finally, in July1960, the court ruled that the publishers should pay a finetotalling several hundred deutschmarks rather than thousands, but otherwise allother charges arising from the original prosecution were to be dropped. Kruse hadlost the battle, but the war against the Moses Book was not over. The trial acted asa spur to others, like Schmidt, Scha ̈fer, and Auhofer, to join Kruse’s crusade.Another consequence of the case was the international spotlight it cast onGermany’s ‘problem’. Even though, as we have seen, the USA was by now theleading global purveyor of cheap magic literature, Germany was portrayed insome quarters as a centre of the market in ‘superstition’. In1957, for instance, areport in the North American press regarding the prosecution of a femalehexenbannerfrom Offenburg, stated that, ‘German book publishers are makingfortunes by printing short pamphlets and long volumes with instructions for thosewishing to practise or benefit by sorcery.’122So far we have seen how concerns over the social influence of theSixth andSeventh Books of Mosesled to the rather unlikely coalition of those inspired by anti-clericalism, professional medical hegemony, and Catholic authority. Protestantparticipation in the crusade was personified by the industrious Lutheran ministerKurt Koch (1913–87). While Kruse was battling against the influence of theSixthand Seventh Books of Magicin northern Germany, Koch had been orchestrating asimilar campaign against the use of such ‘devilish merchandise’ in the southernGerman province of Baden and neighbouring Switzerland. He fought, he said,against the ‘flood of magical conjuration which washes the Alps’.123Koch, whosetheological career began after receiving a revelation from God at the age of17,trained for the ministry at the University of Tu ̈bingen, and specialized in thepractice of evangelical Christian psychiatry.124From the commencement of hispastoral activities in the1930s he began to record the instances of magical practiceshe and fellow ministers encountered in parts of southern Germany, Switzerland,and Austria. Over three decades he claimed to have compiled a file containingthousands of cases of occult disturbance, many of them the result of experienceswith magical healing and grimoires. During the1960s he wrote a series of books inGerman on the perceived occult crisis, and the success of the English translations,marketed for a popular audience, soon gave him international renown. By the1970s he was lecturing all over the world on the evils of the occult in the modernworld. He saw himself as leading a Protestant counselling crusade, believingpsychotherapists were failing both religiously and practically to deal with themental traumas being caused.Pulp Magic|259"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Koch shared the same goal as Kruse. He had participated in the Planet-Verlagtrial, and consideredHexen unter uns?one of the most informative works oncontemporary ‘superstition’. However, considering Kruse’s anti-clerical stance, itis not surprising that the two campaigners did not share the same interpretation offolk magic. Koch accused Kruse of ‘failing to recognize its true background’.125For Koch folk magic was not merely pernicious or foolish superstition. Whetherwhite or black, it had ‘the devil’s very own stamp on it’.126He recognized that itscontinued popularity was because it seemed, in many cases, to have successfullycured the sick and the victims of witchcraft and spirits, but Satan’s hooks leftlasting moral and psychological damage. For the evangelical Koch all this magicalactivity had apocalyptic significance: ‘an increasing flood of occult movementstries to overrule the Church of Christ. We live in the last phase of the end of theage . . . Empowered by this fact we can dare to face all the onslaughts of thedefeated foe.’127Koch detected three groups of grimoire owners. There were those who wereaware of the ungodliness of keeping such books and kept them a close secret,passing their copies on to their eldest sons only on their deathbeds. Those in thesecond group confessed their awful secret to their families and requested them toburn their magic books. During his ministrations many copies had been handedover to Koch to be destroyed in this way. The most disquieting group consisted ofthose, including churchmen, who believed that some grimoires were godlyreligious texts, the devilish charms they contained being camouflaged by the useof Christian words, symbols, and customs. During a large conference of pastors,for instance, Koch strongly protested when a local conjurer was characterized as adecent, godly man. How could he be if he practised charming?128In1961Koch warned that such books ‘circulate among people like poisonousgases, poisoning their very minds and souls’.129TheSixth and Seventh Books,inparticular, had ‘caused untold harm in the world and people who read it invariablysuffer in the process’.130Those who used it were in thrall to the Devil. In evidencehe cited the following case:At a youth conference a17-year-old lad came to an evangelical meetingwith a New Testament in his left pocket and, bound in similar format, the6th and7th book of Moses in his right. My assistant at this meeting tookthe6th and7th Book of Moses from him. We looked through the magicbook and found that the lad had bound himself to the devil by putting hissignature underneath a picture of Lucifer. We then burned the book.131The mere possession of the book was enough to cause misfortune and severepsychological damage. An ethno-psychiatric study conducted in1950s Ghana hadsuggested that expressions of the intention to practise magic using theSixth and260|Pulp Magic"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Seventh Books of Moses‘frequently herald the onset of schizophrenia’.132For Kochthe Moses Book was the cause not the symptom of mental illness. ‘It is aremarkable observation of pastoral experience’, he observed, ‘that in all homesand families in which the6th and7th Book of Moses is kept, or even used,psychological disturbances of various kinds appear.’ ‘I have not met one possessorof the6th and7th Book of Moses who had no psychological complications,’ heconcluded. One man who used it to charm people and animals died in terriblepain ‘amid the spread of a penetrating odour’, even though he had burned hiscopy. When the man’s sister, who was sceptical about magic, used some of theformulae in mockery, ‘she sensed a change in her emotional equilibrium, becameinsane, suffered manic attacks’, and ended up in a mental institution.133It waseven the cause of many cases of hereditary psychological problems. Indeed this ishow he explained his own childhood experience of terrible nocturnal visions ofdiabolic beasts. Kurt’s father revealed to him that his great-grandmother had usedtheSixth and Seventh Book of Moses: ‘At one stroke I understood the variouscoincidences in the experiences of my father and his siblings, and also in myown childhood. My grandmother, about whom there had been many rumours,was thus the demon-oppressed daughter of a spell-caster.’134How successful was the anti-grimoire campaign in Germany? Could Kochbreak the devilish cycle he so graphically demonstrated? Well, perhaps it had alimited localized influence. An ethnological study of witchcraft in the deep ruralregion of central Germany known as Franconian Switzerland noted in the early1970s that ‘While almost all of the older peasants know of the book . . . few haveseen it. I have met only one person who admitted to having seen—indeed used—the book.’ It was suggested that this was due to the success of the Church inrestricting its availability.135As we have seen elsewhere, however, the perceivedscarcity of grimoires does not tally with the reality of their easy availability. Kochand his ilk also had to battle the tidal wave of Western occult interest that surged inthe1970s. Ultimately Koch would be no more successful than King Cnut. Duringthe1970s and1980s German publishers continued to pump out editions of theSixth and Seventh Books of Moses.136Planet-Verlag reprinted its1953edition ofDasZehnte, Elfte und Zwo ̈lfte Buch Mosesin the1970s along withDas sechste bis zwo ̈lfteBuch Moses.

The merging of fact and fiction had always been an integral aspect of thegrimoire tradition, and in the twentieth century this was given a new twist withthe genre of literary fantasy not only being influenced by the magical tradition butalso inspiring the creation of new grimoires. They also reached a new audience,attracting the attention of counter-culture movements in the post-war West. As aconsequence they became the basis for new, non-Christian religions whose appealstretched far beyond the rarefied, middle-class esotericism of the Golden Dawnand its offshoots.NecronomiconSeveral Victorian and Edwardian novelists, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton andArthur Machen, who translated Casanova’sMemoires, had a personal, practicalinterest in magic that fed into their work. Bulwer-Lytton’sZanoni(1842), whichconcerned the adventures of aRosicrucian mage at the time of the FrenchRevolution, begins with a thinly veiled account of John Denley’s occult bookshopin Covent Garden. InThe Column of Dust(1909) by Evelyn Underhill, a one-timemember of the Golden Dawn like Machen, the main character, Constance Tyrrel,a bookseller’s assistant, conjures up a spirit by reciting from ‘a rare old English"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"translation of the ‘‘Grand Grimoire’’ ’.1It is somewhat surprising, then, that theauthors of the two most intriguing fictional grimoires of the early twentiethcentury had little practical interest in the magical tradition.The novelist W. H. Hodgson (1877–1918) created the first of these moderngrimoires, namely the fourteenth-century Sigsand manuscript. Written in‘ye olde’ English, this was the key inspiration for the occult practices of Hodgson’sghost hunter and private detective, Thomas Carnacki, whose amazing exploitswere recounted in a series of short stories written between1910and1914. ForCarnacki, ‘ninety-nine cases in a hundred turn out to be sheer bosh and fancy,’but the other one per cent brought him face to face with various denizens of thespirit world. Despite his usual rationalist outlook, Carnacki relies heavily on magicfor protection. In ‘The Gateway of the Monster’ Carnacki explains to his friendsthe nature of his main defence against evil spirits. It was a Solomonic pentacledrawn within a circle on the floor. Garlic was rubbed around the circle while justwithin it he marked out the ‘Second Sign of the SaaamaaaRitual’, joining eachwith a left-handed crescent, in the valley of which he placed a lighted candle. Fiveportions of bread wrapped in linen, and five jars of a ‘certain water’ were placedceremoniously within the pentacle. This ‘defence’ was taken from the Sigsandmanuscript, and had saved his life—but only just. To strengthen its power heenhanced the ancient magic with the power of new scientific forces by positioningvacuum tubes within the pentagram and passing a current through them.2Car-nacki cites brief excerpts from the Sigisand manuscript here and there in thestories, and its advice constantly frames his understanding of the spirit world andhow to deal with it, but otherwise its contents remain largely a mystery.Hodgson, the son of a clergyman, had a youthful lust for the sea, and his parentsreluctantly agreed to him signing on for the mercantile marines. After beingbullied by a second mate, Hodgson became an early adherent of judo and body-building, and when his nautical career came to an end he set up a school ofphysical culture in Blackburn. It was when his school closed down in1902that heturned to a career writing tales of the fantastic. He enlisted in1914, was decom-missioned after an injury on active service in1916, and then re-enlisted in1917.He was killed near Ypres in April1918.3Hodgson was certainly an enthusiasticphotographer, which may have led to an interest in spiritual investigation, butotherwise there is nothing in his brief and tragic biography to indicate any deepinterest in the occult. But there is no reason to suggest that his interest in grimoireswas anything but casual. After all, the author of the most enduring and influentialfictional grimoire, theNecromonicon, likewise had little initial knowledge of thesubject.The childhood of Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890–1937), the son of a salesrepresentative fromRochester, New York, was not the happiest either. In1893Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|263"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"his father went insane while they were staying at a Chicago hotel. He washospitalized and died five years later. Thereafter, Howard was brought up by hismother and her father. A precocious and voracious reader, Lovecraft’s imagin-ation was stoked by the eclectic contents of his grandfather’s library, and hedeveloped a dual passion for modern science and old traditions and beliefs,devouring theThousand and One Nights, Grimm’s fairy tales, and Greek andmedieval mythology. Yet, Lovecraft had no interest in merely regurgitatingexisting folklore and mythologies in his own fiction; rather he advocated usingthe corpus to create ‘new artificial myths’.4He became skilled at inventingtraditions, creating a verisimilitude of folklore.Most of Lovecraft’s fiction was published in the pulp fantasy and horrormagazineWeird Tales. For many years after his death Lovecraft’s work was nottaken seriously as literature because it was published in such pulp publications, butnow ‘he has become an icon in popular culture in partbecausehis work appearedthere.’5Grimoires were a favourite motif for the writers of pulp horror andfantasy. In a letter written in1936Lovecraft listed some of the ‘terrible andmysterious books so darkly mentioned in weird magazine stories’.6Amongthem wasRobert E. Howard’sUnaussprechlichen Kulten. Howard, who is bestknown for his creation Conan the Barbarian, described the first edition ofUnaussprechlichen Kultenas appearing in Du ̈sseldorf in1839—a nice touch echoing,whether knowingly or not, the publication of the Horst and Scheible libraries ofthe occult.Robert Bloch, who would later pen the bestsellerPsycho, invented theDe Vermis Mysteriis, a magic book owned by an alchemist and necromancer namedLudvig Prinn burned at the stake in Brussels during the late fifteenth or earlysixteenth century. Prinn, who claimed to have lived for several centuries, said hegained his knowledge from Syrian wizards while captive during the Crusades.Incomplete fragments ofThe Book of Eibon, invented by Clark Ashton Smith,contained magical formulae and accounts of the exploits of the ancient wizardEibon, and were said to exist in English, French, and Latin translations.7Thecommunity of horror and fantasy authors freely appropriated these creations at thetime. Lovecraft made reference to and had a hand in developing the mythology ofall three of the above examples, but it was his own addition to the corpus thatwent on to have the most enduring influence.Lovecraft’s first reference to theNecronomicon—the name was probably inspiredby Marcus Manilius’s astrological poemAstronomica—was in a story called ‘TheHound’, written in1922and published inWeird Talesin1924.8The storyconcerns a couple of grave-digging, relic hunters bent on finding ever moreitems for their private museum of blasphemous ‘universal terror’—a collectionwhich already contained theNecronomicon. They travel to Holland to plunder the264|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"grave of a medieval mage. In his coffin they find a curious jade amulet with strangeinscriptions carved on the base:Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balancedreaders know, but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbiddenNecronomiconof the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred . . . All too well did wetrace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist;lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifest-ation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead.9TheNecromoniconpopped up again in ‘The Festival’, written a year later andpublished inWeird Talesin1925, which was inspired by Lovecraft’s recent readingof Margaret Murray’sThe Witch-Cult in Western Europe, the wider influence ofwhich I shall come back to shortly. The narrator is compelled by his ancestors tovisit the fictional New England town of Kingsport one snowy Yuletide. In1692four of his kinsmen had been hanged for witchcraft just outside the town. Hisdestination is the house of an old, mute gentleman. He is shown into a dark, dankcandle-lit room where on a table there lay a pile of ‘hoary and mouldy’ books.Amongst them were the ‘terribleSaducismus Triumphatusof Joseph Glanvill,published in1681, the shockingDaemonolatreiaofRemigius, printed in1595atLyons, and worst of all the unmentionableNecronomiconof the mad Arab AbdulAlhazred, in Olaus Wormius’ forbidden Latin translation’.10The first two booksare real, and the last not.It is possible that the Sigsand manuscript may have been the seed for Lovecraft’sNecronomicon. Lovecraft had great respect for Hodgson’s work, writing in an essayon ‘Supernatural Horror in Literature’ that ‘Few can equal him in adumbratingthe nearness of nameless forces and monstrous besieging entities through casualhints and insignificant details, or in conveying feelings of the spectral and theabnormal.’11He was less than thrilled by Hodgson’s conception of Carnacki’smagical defences, though, stating that ‘scenes and events [are] badly marred by anatmosphere of professional ‘‘occultism.’’ ’ Lovecraft was more inclined towardsAlgernon Blackwood’s stories about the investigations of the ‘Psychic Doctor’John Silence, which were undoubtedly also an inspiration for Hodgson. Silencedespised the word ‘occultism’ and his powers are those unleashed by the power ofthought rather than the ritual, magical trappings employed by Carnacki.Over the next couple of years the mysterious, notoriousNecronomiconcroppedup tantalizingly here and there in several other short stories. Like Hodgson andthe Sigsand manuscript, Lovecraft made appetizingly few references to theNecronomicon, and so the exact nature of its contents is never clear to the reader.Was it a source of mystical secrets, a demonological disquisition, or a book ofpractical magic? In1927Lovecraft decided to clarify in his own mind what it wasLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|265"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"by constructing a brief ‘history’ of its existence to ensure that there was someconsistency in his future references to it. According to this history, a mad Yemenypoet named Abdul Alhazred penned theAl Azif,orNecronomiconas it came to beknown, during the early eighth centuryad. His wisdom was accrued through hisvisits to the ruins of Babylon, the subterranean chambers of Memphis, and asolitary spiritual sojourn in the Arabian Desert. As a twelfth-century biographerrecounted, through his experiences Alhazred had discovered the existence ofa secret race of beings older than Man, entities whom he began to worship andcalled Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu. It was inad 950that theAl Azifwas secretlytranslated into Greek under the titleNecronomicon, copies of which were soughtand destroyed by the Church. Some escaped their attentions and in1228OlausWormius translated it into Latin. Though quickly banned by Pope Gregory IX,one edition of it was printed in Germany during the fifteenth century and another,probably in Spain, two centuries later. A Greek edition was printed in Italybetween1500and1550. The last copy of the latter was found and burned inSalem in1692. John Dee made a translation that only survives in fragments.Existing Latin versions are kept in the British Library, the Bibliotheque Nationale,Harvard, the University of Buenos Aires, and Miskatonic University Library,Arkham (one of Lovecraft’s creations).This invented history is a prime example of Lovecraft’s ‘artificial’ myth-making, weaving real people, such as Wormius (actually a seventeenth-centuryDanish physician), Gregory, and Dee, and real events, such as the Salem witchtrials, into a realistic sounding history that mimicked the bogus traditions thatclung to real grimoires. What inspired it? Lovecraft’s knowledge of occult historywas surprisingly limited during the1920s.12His main source of information wasthe entry on ‘magic’ in theEncyclopedia Britannica. Indeed in1925he admitted toan acquaintance that he was ‘appallingly ignorant’ on such matters. ‘Are there anygood translations of any mediaeval necromancers with directions for raising spirits,invoking Lucifer, & all that sort of thing?’, he asked.13Lovecraft had little interestin the vibrant folk traditions of the present and so seems to have been completelyunaware of the popularity of theSixth and Seventh Books of MosesamongstAmerica’s working classes. There is also no evidence that he knew of thePicatrix, which would at first glance seem to be the obvious inspiration for thehistory of theNecromonicon. The Arabic context was evidently inspired primarilyby his passion for theArabian NightsandVathek, William Beckford’s eighteenth-century Gothic Arabian tale of magic.14As we have seen with regard to theShriners, at the time Lovecraft was writing there was also considerable Americanfascination with legends of rediscovered ancient Arabic mystical knowledge.In1936, when his knowledge on the subject had certainly improved, he musedthat a mix of scraps of medieval European and Near Eastern rituals and266|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"incantations for summing spirits, ‘such as A. E. Waite and ‘‘Eliphas Levi’’ repro-duce’, would ‘constitute something vaguely like what theNecromoniconand itscongeners are supposed to be’.15It is possible that Lovecraft’s interest in mysterious occult books, and that ofhis fellow writers of weird tales, was also influenced by the public interest in andcontroversy over the Voynich manuscript.16In1912the political e ́migre ́andLondon book dealer Wilfred Michael Voynich came across a highly unusualilluminated manuscript in a wooden chest in the remote Jesuit castle of VillaMondragone in Frascati, Italy: at least that was the version of its discovery thatcirculated after his death. In his own lifetime he only divulged that he had found itin a castle or monastery in southern Europe. Not long after his arrival in England,after fleeing Siberian exile, Voynich accrued a reputation in the trade for his abilityto uncover unknown and lost books. Part of his success was due to the periodictours he made across Europe visiting impoverished religious establishments. Oneof the medieval manuscripts he found appeared, at first glance, to be an astrologicalherbal not unlike numerous others of the period. However, this one was writtenin an unknown cipher and contained numerous naked, bathing female figures.Even more curiously none of the plants illustrated were obviously identifiable.Voynich displayed it to English and French scholars before moving to America in1914. Several years later he had photostatic copies made of some of the pages andsent them to American and European academics. They soon attracted controversyand intrigue.Voynich believed his mysterious book to be of the thirteenth century andsuspected that its author might have been none other than Albertus Magnus orRoger Bacon. He also reckoned he had found evidence that the manuscript hadbeen in the ownership of John Dee, who subsequently sold it toRudolf II. In1921the scholar William Newbold announced that he had been able to decipher partsof the manuscript, and confirmed that its author was indeedRoger Bacon.Voynich capitalized on this sensational endorsement and put the manuscript upfor sale for $160,000—over two million dollars in today’s money. The controversysurrounding it meant, however, that no library or collector was willing to payanything near this price. Doubts about Newbold’s claim were widespread, andin1929the pioneering historian Lynn Thorndike, who would go on to completea monumental eight-volume history of magic and early science, dismissedVoynich’s ‘pet’ manuscript as ‘an anonymous manuscript of dubious value’.17Itremained unsold until a New York book dealer paid out $24,500for it not longafter the death of Voynich’s wife. The dealer hoped to make a killing on this nownotorious manuscript, but ended up donating it to Yale University in1969. Therewas too much suspicion surrounding it. If, as it has been suggested, it was anhistorical hoax perpetrated by Edward Kelley to fleece John Dee, then it wouldLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|267"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"still have considerable historical curiosity value. Others, including myself, suspect,however, that it was a modern hoax perpetrated by or on Voynich.A few months before he died Lovecraft wrote to a friend, ‘If theNecronomiconlegend continues to grow, people will end up believing in it.’18By1936someonehad, as a prank, advertised that copies were available for $1.49. Lovecraft suspectedRobert Bloch. The idea of writing aNecromoniconcertainly appealed to Lovecraft,and he expressed the wish that he would have ‘the time and imagination to assistin such a project’. Yet, at the same time, he felt that no such publication would beas ‘terrible and impressive’ as that which could be hinted at. It would have to runto more than a thousand pages to simulate what he had already described, and sohe thought that he could only feasibly achieve the ‘translation’ of certain passagesof the book. Ultimately though, he opined, ‘I am opposed to serious hoaxes, sincethey really confuse and retard the sincere student of folklore. I feel quite guiltyevery time I hear of someone’s having spent valuable time looking up theNecronomiconat public libraries.’19Others were less conscientious.Over the decades several authors have claimed to have discovered manuscriptversions, and in the1980s one magician even claimed to have in his possession a4,000-year-old grimoire from which theNecronomiconderived. People nowpractise ‘Lovecraftian’ magic.20The most successful of the print editions was theSimonNecronomicon, a ninth-century Greek text discovered by monks andbrought to America in the1970s by an Eastern Orthodox bishop named Simon.The first ‘translated’ edition appeared in a limited, leather-bound edition of666copies. Subsequent hardback and paperback reprints went on to sell in their manythousands. The SimonNecronomiconis a well-constructed hoax. Its contents havebeen stitched together from printed sources on Mesopotamian myth and magic,and its supposed discovery by monks is a well-worn motif in grimoire history. Butas a piece of magical literature it, and otherNecronomicons, are no less ‘worthy’ thantheir predecessors. Like other famous grimoires explored in this book, it is theirfalsity that makes them genuine.21The concern Lovecraft expressed about theblurring of fact and fiction regarding theNecronomicon, and the potential forconfusing the earnest student of the occult, was born out with much greaterconsequence with the founding text of modern witchcraft.The Book of ShadowsIn his short story ‘The Grimoire’, published in1936, Montague Summers(1880–1948) created theMysterium Arcanum, or to give its full title,The SecretMystery, or the Art of Evoking Evil Spirits with certain other Most Curious and CloseMatters. The story tells of how a book collector of agnostic persuasion, Dr Julian268|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Hodsoll, purchases theMysteriumfrom an antiquarian book dealer for five guineas.It was published in the early seventeenth century and, like numerous printedgrimoires, bore the imprint ‘Rome’. Hodsoll’s experienced eye recognizes thatthis place of publication could not be true. As he informs the book dealer, thecontents ‘sound appetizing enough, but it may only be a hash-up of the PetitAlbert and that wretched Pope Honorius.’22Hodsoll visits his learned friendCanon Spenlow and shows him his latest acquisition. Spenlow quickly realizesthe evil, satanic nature of its contents. He recommends that theMysteriumshouldbe burned, but Hodsoll’s curiosity gets the better of him. That night, he translatesone of its conjurations, ‘A most Powerful and Efficacious Evocation’, reading itthrough softly to himself. Shortly after, a strange servant enters the room and asks,‘You wanted me, sir’ before being dismissed. Over the next few days severaluncanny occurrences are experienced in the Canon’s house. Fortunately a friendof Spenlow’s, a Dominican friar named FatherRaphael, an expert on the DarkArts, pays a visit and is on hand when the mysterious servant reveals his satanicidentity and attacks Hodsoll, who had unwittingly summoned him.Raphaelbanishes the devil, making ‘swift sacred sigils in the air and spoke certain Latinwords of might’. The story ends with the cautionary coda that the once agnosticHodsoll sees the error of his ways and becomes a Carmelite priest.Now, there is definitely something of Montague Summers in the character ofHodsoll.23He was a larger-than-life figure who studied theology at OxfordUniversity and was ordained a Deacon of the Anglican Church in1908. Shortlyafter, he was charged and acquitted of pederasty. This, along with rumoursregarding his interest in Satanism and the occult, cut short his clerical career.The following year he converted to Catholicism, and although he liked to givethe impression that he was a priest—calling himselfReverend, conducting privatemasses, wearing the Carmelite scapular—there is no evidence he was officiallyordained. He made a living by pursuing a writing career based on his interest inwitchcraft, demonology,Restoration drama, and Gothic literature. As his erudite,populist booksThe History of Witchcraft and Demonology(1926) andWitchcraft andBlack Magic(1945) show, unlike the creator of theNecromonicon, Summers waswidely read in the history and content of grimoires. Where he departed from mostother historians of the period was that he truly believed that covens of Devil-worshipping witches, who made pacts with their master, had existed in the pastand continued to do so secretly in the present. He consequently thoroughlyendorsed the witch trials of the early modern period. Summers believed grimoireswere an essential link in the perpetuation and promotion of diabolism, providingthe means to call up the Devil, describing them as ‘abominable’, ‘vile’, and‘dangerous’. We hear Summers’ voice when Hodsoll’s wonders, ‘Could it bethat the mysterious book of the witches had fallen into his hands, that volumeLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|269"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"which was mentioned in more than one trial of the seventeenth century, butwhich apparently had never been seen by any who was not a member of thathorrid society?’24What, then, would he have made of theBook of Shadows?In the1950s a new religion called Wicca emerged in Britain. Its founder wasGerald Gardner (1884–1964), a manager and civil servant in the colonial Far Eastwho retired to England in the mid-1930s. He had an active interest in spiritualism,Eastern mysticism, folklore, and Freemasonry, and steeped himself in the writingsof Charles Leland and Aleister Crowley, and the theories of Margaret Murray(1863–1963). It was the latter who inspired Gardner’s belief that many of the tensof thousands of people tried and executed for witchcraft in early modern Europewere not Devil worshippers, as Summers believed, but members of an ancientpagan religion that had survived centuries of Christian persecution. InThe WitchCult in Western Europe(1921), and in subsequent publications, Murray, who was arespected Egyptologist, argued that what the medieval Church denounced aswitchcraft was, in fact, the beliefs and practices of a prehistoric fertility cultbased around the worship of a horned God.25She arrived at this conclusion bythe highly selective and misleading use of sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuryconfessions concerning witches’ Sabbats, most of which were obtained throughtorture. Murray thought that this remnant ancient pagan religion finally suc-cumbed to the weight of persecution sometime in the eighteenth century.Gardner remarked that he ‘did not think that anyone, with the exception of theRevd Montague Summers, dared hint that there might be anything in witchcraftto-day without being laughed at’.26Nevertheless, Gardner claimed that in1939he had discovered and been initiated into a coven of secret pagan worshippers inthe New Forest, Hampshire. Murray’s witch cult had survived! He recalled laterthat, as a member of the Folklore Society and the Society for PsychicalResearch,he had wanted to announce this amazing discovery to the learned community.But coven members resisted. They were not afraid of being laughed at though.‘ ‘‘The Age of Persecution is not over,’’ they told me; ‘‘give anyone half a chanceand the fires will blaze up again.’’ ’27He was only permitted to describe theirexistence in fictional terms, and so in1949he produced a novel about the witchcult,High Magic’s Aid, which was set in the distant past. It was only in1954and theappearance of his bookWitchcraft Todaythat Gardner went public and Wicca wastruly born.According to Gardner the rituals and wisdom of the ancient witch cult hadsurvived—only just—thanks to their being recorded in a grimoire known as theBook of Shadows. Copies were passed down through covens from one generationto the next. The nature of this grimoire began to be revealed by Gardner, who hadreceived his own copy after his initiation, and was subsequently developed withinput from one of his first followers Doreen Valiente, who would later provide a270|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"thoughtful self-reflexive history of the movement. Although pirated versions oftheBook of Shadowsbegan to appear in print from the1960s onwards, Gardner hadproduced a manuscript version in the late1940s entitled ‘Ye Bok of ye ArtMagical’.28It had the air of a venerable grimoire, with its leather cover, ornatescripts, and spelling mistakes indicative of repeated copying over the gener-ations.29But the contents seemed suspiciously familiar to those who analysed itcarefully. Could this grimoire really hold the mysteries of an ancient religion?If ‘Ye Bok’, and the laterBook of Shadowscopied and passed on by the originalmembers of Gardner’s own initiates, was not copied from the New Forest coven,then what source or sources did he draw upon? A perusal of Gardner’s libraryreveals some texts already well known to the reader. There were, of course, theworks of A. E. Waite and other members of the Golden Dawn, as well as amanuscript of the ‘Grimoire of Honorius’. We also find copies of HenriGamache’sLong Lost8th,9th and10th books of Moses(1948), Gamache’sTerrors ofthe Evil Eye Exposed(1946), and de Claremont’s7Keys to Power(1940).30Gardnerhad probably purchased these Dorene publications during a visit to his brother inAmerica in the winter of1947–8. While there he may also have read a short storyby Lovecraft’s friend Clark Ashton Smith, which was published inWeird Talesin1947. This tale of wizardry referred to a magical knife known as the ‘arthame’, andin Gardner’s grimoire we find a ritual knife called ‘athame’. Smith did not inventthe word, but it is possible that Gardner may have been inspired by his use of it.31Gardner acknowledged that in writingHigh Magic’s Aidhe borrowed heavilyfrom rituals contained in Mathers’ homogenous version of theGreater Key ofSolomon. He told acquaintances that he resorted to copying its examples of ‘JewishRitual Magic’ partly as a matter of expediency, and also to respect the wishes of hiscoven members that he should not publish the ‘real’ rituals of their prehistoricreligion.32In defence of the notion that theBook of Shadowswas not completelyGardner’s invention, one Wiccan historian has made the good point that asMathers’Key of Solomonwas printed in1888it could have seeped into Englishfolk magic and been adopted by the New Forest coven prior to Gardner’ssupposed initiation.33As this Wiccan author notes, and as has been demonstratedin this book, printed grimoires infused remarkably quickly into oral magicaltraditions. But the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that ‘Ye Bok’ and theBook of Shadowswere purely Gardner’s work, drawn primarily from theKey ofSolomon, Aleister Crowley’s books, which were in turn reliant on Golden Dawntexts, and Charles Leland’sAradia.34Gardner was a show-off and not averse to embroidering the truth. He styledhimself a ‘Dr’ though he never wrote a PhD.35It is hardly a shocking revelationthat he invented the existence of the New Forest coven and therefore fabricatedthe history of theBook of Shadows, though it has taken considerable meticulousLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|271"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"research to convince some of his adherents. Yet in creating theBook of ShadowsGardner was merely following the long tradition of grimoire formulation, makingfalse attributions, providing false histories, and compiling spells and rituals fromunacknowledged sources. In this sense theBook of Shadowshas both a venerablehistory and legitimacy in magical tradition. Furthermore, he produced the first‘pagan’ grimoire in more than a millennium—even if its contents were based onJudaic and Christian magic. As well as numerous versions of theBook of Shadows,Wicca has inspired a profusion of other neo-pagan ritual and spell books, and theirproduction shows no sign of diminishing. These days most pagan witches areaware of Gardner’s fabrications and accept that their religion is not part of acontinuous tradition.For many, theBook of Shadowsis not a Bible, a founding religious text fromwhich one should not deviate. It is, instead, adapted, and personalized accordingto practitioners’ interests, creativity, and needs. As a consequence, the manuscripttradition continues as an important aspect of modern magical practice.36Like thescrapbook grimoires of some cunning-folk,Books of Shadowsare part manual, partdiary, and part guide to spiritual or physical well being. Furthermore, bookknowledge more generally is central to the creation and spread of neo-paganismin all its various forms: it is born of a literary rather than an oral heritage. As a studyof American paganism in the1980s observed, ‘a common feature in the life storiesof American witches is that the concepts of the belief system are first contacted onthe library shelf.’ Around the same time a study of British Wiccans noted that,before their initiation, Wiccans were typically avaricious readers of fantasy andscience fiction. They then progressed to reading about magic, tarot, astrology,and the supernatural, and after several years in the ‘craft’ their libraries on relatedsubjects extended above a hundred volumes.37The enthusiasm for readingaround the subject of witchcraft has also led to scholarly historical and anthropo-logical books acting as source material and being incorporated into the conceptualand ritual basis of neo-pagan practice.38Satan’s Bible?TheSatanic Biblecompletes our triptych of iconic modern grimoires, and was inpart a reaction to theBook of Shadows. Its author was the showman and entertain-ing liar Anton Szandor LaVey. Howard Stanton Levey, as his birth certificaterecords his name, was born in April1930, the son of a Chicago salesman. Thefamily moved to San Francisco shortly after his birth and nothing of particularprofundity seems to have happened in his life until he dropped out of high schooland self-consciously immersed himself in the romantically seedy environment of272|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"pool halls and gambling dens. He eked out a living playing the organ in nightclubswhile instructing himself in the history and practice of the occult arts. His readingseems to have consisted mostly of populist works on witchcraft by the likes ofW. B. Seabrook and Montague Summers, along with A. E. Waite’s books onmagic.39LeVey began to shape his occult persona, influenced by the fictionalcharacter of Stanton Carlisle in William Lindsay Gresham’s1946noir pulp novelNightmare Alley, which was turned into a film starring Tyrone Power. Greshamwas fascinated with freak shows, stage magic, and spiritualism, writing severalnon-fiction books on the subject.40His interests fed directly into the depiction ofthe rise and fall of Stan Carlisle, a carny con-artist clairvoyant who sets up his ownspiritualist movement to fleece the well-to-do. Anyone who has read the bookcan see its influence on LaVey’s fabricated biography of his misanthropic adven-tures in the world of carnival life and strip joints.41Like many self-proclaimedmasters of the occult before him, LaVey claimed gypsy ancestry—this time from aTransylvanian-born grandmother. She fuelled his imagination with accounts ofthe magical beliefs of her homeland. Another more recent occult tradition hetapped into in his fictitious biography concerned the rumours regarding ThirdReich occultism. He claimed to have visited Germany with an uncle in1945during which he saw secret Nazi horror films that contained depictions of occultrituals.42During the early1960s LaVey set himself up as an expert on the Black Arts inSan Francisco, giving lectures on a diverse array of subjects from the Black Mass toghosts and werewolves. He became something of a local celebrity and his MagicalCircle soirees attracted the likes of the filmmaker and writer Kenneth Anger. Itwas in1966that LaVey underwent the physical transformation that turned himinto a national media figure. He shaved his head and donned a black clerical collar,which along with his carefully arched eyebrows and goatee beard, gave him atheatrical satanic appearance—one befitting the self-styled High Priest of hisnewly formed Church of Satan.For the Church to be taken seriously rather than a mere publicity stunt, LaVeynow had to devise some sort of founding text that would describe and define hisphilosophy and belief system. Two years later, LaVey and his wife had only comeup with a short mimeograph ‘introduction to Satanism’, an assortment of briefpolemical essays and a handout to new members on conducting ritual magic.43Considering his love of publicity, the idea of producing a paperback book for themass market was surprisingly not LaVey’s. It was written at the suggestion of PeterMayer, an editor at Avon Books—a major publisher of pulp fiction and comics,and, later, Simon’sNecronomicon.44In1967Ira Levin’s novelRosemary’s Baby,about a young pregnant woman living in a sinister New York apartment whobelieves she is going to give birth to the son of Satan, had become a sensationalLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|273"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"bestseller. Mayer, having seen some of the press reports about the Church of Satancontacted the LaVeys and suggested they write a ‘Satanic Bible’ to capitalize onthe success of Levin’s novel and the film adaptation that came out a year later.Whether pressured by publishing deadlines, or lacking ideas on how to go aboutwriting a sufficiently thick book of the Church’s philosophy, theSatanic Bible,which came out in January1970, consisted of the corpus of mimeographs theyhad already produced, bulked out with a mish-mash of other texts, includinga plagiarized extract from an obscure social Darwinist political tract publishedin1896, and an adapted version of Crowley’s version of the ‘Enochian Keys’ ofJohn Dee.Considering its patchwork construction, theSatanic Biblehas a surprisingcoherence. It soon becomes quite clear, though, that despite the Church’sname, LaVey’s own playful appearance, and the media hoo-hah, theSatanicBibledoes not advocate Devil worship at all, let alone sacrifice. Satan is a symbolof revolt against Christian hypocrisy and societal authority. Satanism is about theworship of the self, of the identity and potency of the individual. Theatricalmagical rituals are employed to release and enhance these processes. TheSatanicBibleis essentially a rejection of the supernatural. The only thing new about itsphilosophy was, LaVey stated frankly, ‘the formal organisation of a religion basedon the universal traits of man’.45‘Why call it Satanism? Why not call it somethinglike ‘‘Humanism’’?’, he questioned. The answer: ‘Humanism is not a religion. It issimply a way of life with no ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony anddogma.’46As Michael Aquino, an early member of the Church and one of itshistorians commented, if it was not for its existential appeal to the authority of SatantheSatanic Biblecould be seen as ‘merely a social tract by Anton LaVey . . . justone more1960s’-counterculture-cynic atop a soap-box.’47You do not sell an estimated700,000or more books, as theSatanic Bibleisthought to have done since1970, inspire translations into Czech, Swedish, andGerman, and generate illegal editions in Mexico andRussia, without havingconjured up a winning recipe.48Over the years there have never been morethan a few thousand practising Satanists in the USA and Europe, and some of thesebelong to other Satanist groups, such as the Temple of Set. So, who has beenbuying theSatanic Biblein such large numbers and why?49It obviously appealed torebellious teenagers. A1992survey of adolescent Satanism in America observedhow some high school students conspicuously carried theSatanic Biblearound,aping Christian fundamentalist teenagers who made show of their pocket Bibles.50A respondent in another survey wrote: ‘My step-father used to be a Christianpreacher. After being told my choices in clothing, music, art, poetry, etc.were Satanic, I decided to buy theSatanic Bibleto see if it was as bad as he madeit out to be.’51274|Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"People have also been lured into buying it, expecting it to be something that itis not—an espousal of ritual satanic worship. Media reporting enhanced itsreputation as a modern day Devil’s book. Just as in early-twentieth-centuryPennsylvania the press and local authorities saw the influence of theSixth andSeventh Books of Mosesbehind every strange murder, so in the1970s and1980smedia scares linked teenage suicides with the ownership of theSatanic Bibleandlistening to heavy metal music.52As early as1971an article in the Church ofSatan’s bulletinThe Cloven Hoofcomplained that on various occasions theSatanicBiblehad reportedly been found ‘at or near the scene of some crime againstsociety’, and the finger of blame had been pointed at the Church of Satan, eventhough the vast majority of owners of the book were not actually members.53It has been suggested that theSatanic Bible, with its list of infernal names and itsinvocations in a mystical language, indicate that the contents of theSixth andSeventh Books of Mosesinfluenced LaVey.54But the presentation of the two works differs markedly. There is a completelack of occult signs, seals, and tables in theSatanic Bible; yet these were essentialingredients of the Moses Book. Still, the one occult symbol depicted in theSatanicBible, which also appeared on the cover—the Sigil of Baphomet—was crucial toits commercial success. The symbol consists of a goat-headed Satan framed withina pentacle, surrounded by two concentric circles containing five Hebraic figures,which, as LaVey explained, constituted a Kabbalistic spelling of ‘Leviathan’.55Onthe front cover the symbol is coloured purple against a simple black background.The effect is striking and bound to attract the curious, and sensation seekers andthose intrigued by the prospects of Devil worship.The Church of Satan recently conducted its own research into the origin of thesymbol and found its first depiction in Stanislas de Guaita’sLa clef de la magie noire(1897). However, it was a reprint of the image in white against a black backgroundfor the hardback cover of a popularPictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural,published in1964, which inspired LaVey. While theSatanic Biblewas beingwritten, LaVey had a new version of the symbol created with minor changes.This became the logo for the Church of Satan and was successfully registered asa trademark in1983.56The key significance of the Sigil of Baphomet, froma publishing point of view, is that in the popular imagination it conjures upexpectations of Devil worship, black magic, and sacrifice: it creates ‘a sense ofmystery that can only be dispelled by purchasing and reading the book.’57So, manyof its readers must have experienced the same sensations of aroused expectationsand disappointment as, say, the Danish purchasers ofGamleRichards Swartkonst-bokor Feliks Markiewicz’s vauntedSeventh Book of Moses.There are elements of the grimoire format in theSatanic Bible, and the mediaand Christian critics have portrayed it as a book of evil black magic a`la theSixthLovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|275"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Fig.27Sigil of Baphomet from Stanislas de Guaita’sLa Clef de la Magie Noire(1897)."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"and Seventh Books of Moses, but LaVey was openly dismissive of the whole genre.As he wrote in the preface:This book was written because, with very few exceptions, every tract andpaper, every ‘secret’ grimoire, all the ‘great works’ on the subject ofmagic, are nothing more than sanctimonious fraud—guilt-ridden ram-blings and esoteric gibberish by chroniclers of magical lore unable orunwilling to present an objective view of the subject.58In an article in an early edition ofThe Cloven Hoof, LaVey expanded on thisstatement, recalling how at the age of12he had started to readAlbertus MagnusandtheSixth and Seventh Books of Moses, both of which, he remarked, could beobtained ‘in paper before they were called paperbacks’.59Even at this tenderage he claimed he ‘grew disenchanted’ with their contents. ‘It occurred to methere must be ‘‘deeper stuff,’’ so I delved.’ However, he found the deeper stuffalso constituted an ‘ersatz hunk of baloney’.60LaVey dismissed the magicalwritings of Crowley as the work of ‘a poseur par excellence’, and was witheringin his comments on Wiccans.61He nevertheless borrowed and prospered from therenewed interest in magical traditions that they had generated. His follow-upblockbusterSatanicRitualswas more explicitly magical, being a self-acknowledgedragbag of magical traditions—‘a blend of Gnostic, Cabbalistic, Hermetic, andMasonic elements’, with a dash of Lovecraft.62LaVey’s works have spawned a whole new generation of diabolic grimoiresthat are explicitly satanic. Amongst them is Michael W. Ford’sLuciferian Witchcraft(2005), which, echoing the eighteenth-centuryGrand grimoire, promises ‘a talis-manic text which presents the medieval concepts of the Black Book being aconjuration itself of the Devil’, and contains the added spice of ‘forbidden sexmagick’. There is also theDemonic Bible(2006), which began life on the Internet,and which divulges numerous rituals for conjuring up demons. It is advertised aspossibly being ‘the most evil book written’. LaVey would probably have beendisgusted, amused, and not a little flattered.Lovecraft, Satan, and Shadows|277"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"EPILOGUEMuch has been written about the Internet heralding the death of the book. As weall become habituated to reading from electronic screens, so the argument goes,print will be usurped by the digital media. The act of writing has certainly beentransformed, with the keyboard replacing pen and ink as our main means ofputting words on a page. But the book is proving to be resilient and adaptable tothe digital age. There is every reason to believe it will continue to play animportant role in shaping our world. The book is a companion, an instant portalinto other worlds, times, and fantasies. Flipping open a laptop or a multimediaphone and pressing the on button clearly has its own thrill, but the physicalpleasure of handling books and turning their pages, of book marking or annotatingthem, is integral to the absorption and anticipation that a fascinating read inspires.The electronic media is about the here and now, while the book has a venerablehistory that you share every time you turn the page. Generation after generationhas done the same thing. These sensual qualities of the book are essential to thegrimoire experience. Those who owned grimoires in the past had a personalrelationship with them that went beyond mere ownership. They were added toand annotated, and some even gave their blood to enhance the magic theycontained. Some gave their lives.The history of grimoires, as told in these pages, is not only about the signifi-cance of the book in human intellectual development, but also about the desire forknowledge and the enduring impulse to restrict and control it. In this respect theInternet has had a profound and democratic influence. We have seen how in thepast the authorities struggled to control print, and today the main battlegroundover political and religious freedom in undemocratic countries is centred onattempts to control the Internet, to set up virtual borders in cyberspace. Thefear of magic has dissipated, of course, though it still remains. Evangelicals haveburned Harry Potter books, and Delaurence publications are still banned inJamaica. But otherwise the Internet now allows billions to have easy access tothe magic that two millennia of censorship tried to suppress. Yet, as the continuedpublication of old and new grimoires across Europe and the Americas shows,"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"people want topossessas well as read them. The old bond between magic, writing,and the page has been maintained, and shows no sign of being dissolved.The final stage in the democratization of grimoires, while connected to thedevelopment of new media, is more about social liberation. It has taken over2,000years, but women are finally a major force in both the production and the use ofgrimoires. As in other areas of modern cultural and economic life, this can betraced to the late1960s and early1970s, and the rise of feminism and women’scentral role in the Western counterculture. The goddess worship at the heart ofthe new religion of Wicca had a potent symbolic attraction to women seekingmagical and spiritual empowerment. It is no surprise that modern witchcraft wasembraced most enthusiastically in the USA and Britain, where the dominantreligion, Protestantism, downplays the centrality of the biblical Marys, and thefemale saints have little role in devotion. Feminists also looked to the witch trialsof the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as evidence of how misogyny led to thebrutal and terrifying attempt to subjugate and control women in the past. Earlyfeminist works and the media bandied about the wildly exaggerated notion thatmillions of accused witches were executed in the period. This reinforced theconviction that witch hunting was synonymous with woman hunting. Yet, inpart through the influence of Wicca a new positive image of the witch was formedin American and British mass culture, one that was empowering and defiant.Witchcraft was no longer defined by such old stereotypes as the illiterate, wrinkledwoman who vented her frustrations on a harsh world through simple acts ofspiteful magic. Witchcraft was now about magic as a positive form of femaleexpression. Modern witches were reclaiming the inheritance for which theirancestors had died, and that included the books that they were thought to ownas independent-minded women who were sacrificed to maintain patriarchalcontrol.In the USA in the1970s and early1980s AnnaRiva, the pseudonym ofDorothy Spencer, who ran her own mail order hoodoo supplies company,updated the pre-war pulp genre of short, populist grimoires by appealing to thisreformulated conception of the witch, with titles such asModern Witchcraft Spell-book(1973) andSpellcraft, Hexcraft and Witchcraft(1977). There were also morefamiliar titles echoing the Dorene library such asCandle Burning Magic(1980),Powers of the Psalms(1982), andSecrets of Magical Seals: A Modern Grimoire(1975).They have been published regularly ever since for a few dollars. Following in herfootsteps is Migene Gonzalez-Wippler, a PuertoRican academic who has writtenseveral respected books onSanterı ́a. Her awareness of the grimoire tradition hasled her down the commercial path and she now successfully writes and marketsbooks of practical magic. She has produced a new edition of theSixth and SeventhBooks of Mosesas well as aBook of Shadows, along with various guides for makingEpilogue|279"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"amulets, talismans, and spells. The success and influence of both authors is notpredicated on their gender. They have rather spotted a commercial opportunity in amarket formerly dominated by men, by identifying how magic books could bridgethe gap between the old and recent traditions of magic and witchcraft. AnnaRiva’sbooks, for instance, have a cultural and geographical appeal beyond the main USmarket. HerPower of the PsalmsandMagic with Incense and Powdersare to be foundalong with de Claremont’sSeven Keys to Poweron the bookshelves of ‘spiritualworkers’ in Tobago, and herVoodoo Handbook of Cult Secretsis sold in Jamaican drugstores.1That said, in recent years much of the contemporary grimoire market hasbeen aimed at a Western female teenage audience fascinated by the portrayal ofcontemporary practical magic and witchcraft in television dramas, rather thanhistories of witchcraft or the awareness of venerable magical traditions.The Harry Potter books and films have been blamed by some evangelicals forbeing responsible for the explosion of teenage interest in practical magic. Thestory of Hogwarts’ child magicians represents a long tradition of fantasy fictioninvolving youthful wizards, most notably Ursula Le Guin’sWizard of Earthsea.Harry Potter may be set in contemporary Britain, but it is a good old-fashionedsaga about ‘chosen ones’ and their role in the universal struggle between good andevil. Teen witches appear to be more inspired by grimoire magic as part of theeveryday social reality of urban America, rather than titanic wand-waving battlesin remote gothic boarding schools.The Craft(1996) was an influential template for the female teen witch. The filmconcerned four girls in a Los Angeles Catholic high school who practise capriciousand vengeful magic with unfortunate consequences. Other films followed, such asPractical Magic(1998), which borrowed historical themes familiar to millions ofhigh school students taught about the Salem witch trials. It was based on a novelregarding the love lives of a couple of modern-day, hereditary witches in small-town America who cast magic from a grimoire passed down to them throughthe generations. But it was television that really cemented the grimoire as acultural artefact in contemporary Western society. Magic books were central tothe television seriesCharmed(1998–2006), which concerned three co-habitingsister witches in their twenties who get involved in various supernatural escapades.Like all modern screen witches they also happened to be attractive and glamorous,reversing the old stereotype of the hag-witch. The sisters inCharmedderive theirpower from a leather-boundBook of Shadowsthat, so the plot relates, was firstwritten by an unfortunate female ancestor burned at the stake in the seventeenthcentury and was then supplemented over the centuries as it passed down thefemale line.Buffy the Vampire Slayer(1997–2003), with its high school setting, wasthe other influential TV series in inspiring teenagers to explore the possibilities ofmagic. For the first few seasons the Sunnydale School library, with its old books280|Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"on magic taken from the British Library, was central to the narrative, while oneof the central characters, Willow, became a ‘Wiccan’, casting spells using hergrimoire.2It was while Buffy was at its height of popularity that I used to receiveperiodic e-mails from teenagers, mostly girls from the USA and Britain, asking toknow more about witchcraft and how to cast spells. They had seen my personalwebsite presenting my historical studies on witchcraft and magic and assumed Iwas a practitioner. The flow of e-mails tellingly tailed off onceBuffyandCharmedended.While undoubtedly inspired by these American dramas the teen witchphenomenon has developed a life of its own, fostered by the social networkingpossibilities of the Internet, which allow teenagers to form communities outsidethe school environment. Books still remain fundamental to the teen witchexperience though; spells cut-and-pasted from the Web clearly do not havethe same appeal. The American author SilverRavenWolf is the queen of teengrimoire writers, and the advertising blurb for herSolitary Witchencapsulateswell the appeal of her successful formula, explaining that the book ‘relatesspecifically to today’s young adults and their concerns, yet is grounded in themagickal work of centuries past’. Many of the Buffy generation have subse-quently lost interest in practical magic, but others have no doubt developed amore lasting spiritual and social interest in magic as a religion, and havegraduated from guides written specifically for youth culture to exploring thegrimoires of old.The grimoire continues to have huge cultural currency far beyond those whopractise magic or who fantasize about doing so. Several of the largest publishingsensations of the past few years are products of the history of magic books.Apocryphal stories, which were a big influence on the development of grimoires,lie at the heart of the huge success of theDa Vinci Code. The book evidently tapsinto a continuing popular undercurrent of suspicion that over the centuries theChristian authorities have withheld the true story of Christ, and that ancient secretknowledge equals power. King Solomon and his apocryphal magical reputationcontinue to intrigue, with rumours abound on the Internet that Dan Brown iswriting a book calledThe Solomon Key. Another international bestseller, ArturoPerez-Reverte’s rollicking novelThe Club Dumas, and the film adaptationTheNinth Gate, directed byRoman Polanski and starring Johnny Depp, also owe theirpopularity to the notion that secret diabolic books still circulate amongst us. Thestory concerns a maverick antiquarian book dealer who finds himself drawn into adangerous search for the surviving copies of the fictionalBook of the Nine Doors ofthe Kingdom of Shadows, which was printed in the mid-seventeenth century. Itsauthor was burned at the behest of the Inquisition and only three copies weresaved from the flames. Together they provide the key to summoning the Devil.Epilogue|281"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The book dealer’s quest leads him to Paris and Toledo, the legendary medievalhome of magic. All the elements of this story will be familiar to the reader, andthey evidently continue to fascinate today just as they held the attention of readersin earlier centuries.In her bestsellerJonathan Strange and Mr Norrell(2004), Susanna Clarkere-creates an early-nineteenth-century England where learned magic once againbecomes a profound force after centuries in the shadows, echoing the real, thoughdecidedly less fantastic world of Francis Barrett, John Denley, and John Parkins.Old magic books are central to her clever, gothic re-imagining of the occultmilieu of the period, mentioning titles that sound familiar to the reader but are infact her own inventions. Clarke even constructs her own history of literary magic,inventing the maxim, ‘a book of magic should be written by a practising magician,rather than a theoretical magician or a historian of magic. What could be morereasonable? And yet already we are in difficulties.’3This history of grimoires hasshown what those difficulties were in the real past.So grimoires are still with us, not mere historical artefacts but cultural symbols,but what of the magic they contain? Only a small minority in the prosperousWestern world still believe in the power of magic let alone practise it. This cannotbe explained as a result of education and the consequent spread of rationalknowledge. We need only think of the enduring popularity of magic’s partner,astrology. Many millions continue to believe in the intercessionary power ofangels. Furthermore, literacy has always been the key to the power of grimoires,and their spread actually mirrors the growth of popular education. No, reason hasnot ended our relationship with magic. It is just that most of us in the West nolonger need magic in our lives. Who needs to conjure up spirits to find buriedtreasure when you can use a metal detector? Seriously, though, much of magicwas also about health. Modern medicine can do so much more for us than it couldfifty years ago let alone a hundred. Before that it was pretty hopeless at dealingwith most major illnesses. Wherever people do not have access to modernmedicine today it is understandable that they still depend on magic, on religiousfaith alone. With sexual liberation, the freedom to divorce, and the pill, fewnow resort to grimoires to ensure the success of their love lives, though as thepopularity of horoscopes and astrological birth signs suggests, many people stillplace some faith in the occult to try and ensure successful relationships. Butgrimoire magic was not only put to practical ends. As we have seen, for someintellectual magicians magic was about religious expression and attaining spiritualharmony, and while this impulse might be rare in the context of the main religionsthese days, it continues to be central to the new Western formulations of thepre-Christian religious world and to syncretic religions elsewhere.282|Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Grimoires have never been more easily available.
