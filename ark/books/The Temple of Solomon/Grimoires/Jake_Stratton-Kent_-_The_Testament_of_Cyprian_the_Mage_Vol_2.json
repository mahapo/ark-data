The ‘Introduction’ and ‘Life ofthe Saint’ from the Book of Saint Cyprian led to the deep waters of the Testament, Theurgy and thetechnical Hermetica. These were of course contemporaneous with our Saint; they would haveconstituted his bookshelf. These were thus necessary diversions, important and relevant; they werealso sufficient notice of more to follow. Thus it is that while some passages of his grimoire may belightly passed over with a bare description and pointers to parallel texts, others will require in depthelucidation.Now begins the analysis of the first part of the compendium – entitled ‘The Treasure of the Wizard’– which begins with a useful guide to conduct and concentration, necessary qualities for would bemagicians of either sex. The necessity of avoiding crossings and holy signs is repeated; whichincidentally is a requirement frequently mentioned in connection with Sibyl rituals (her circle in Scot,the chamber in GV &c.). The ideal site for magical operations is described, and it is probably not toofanciful to see a World Image in the mountain surrounded by a river, akin to the Earth and Oceanus inearly Greek thought. A declaration is also described, in terms which unquestionably involve acommitment to the party of Lucifer, departing from the ranks of God’s faithful. All this is quoted infull for the reader’s meditations, commentary returning with the matter of a suitable talisman."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Treasure of the WizardKnowledge necessary to exercise the magical artsTHAT PERSON, male or female, who wishes to dedicate their spirit to magical arts, must possessa true vocation for it, putting all their will and good faith into the exercises and practices. It isvery important that the spirits you invoke are kept in your thoughts, and invocation is performedwith all the senses without relaxing in the least attention to the work in hand. Else, instead ofbenefiting from the invocation, you will be punished for recklessness by the same spirits youbothered or called to make agreement with. You must also perform the invocations at a sitewhere there are no blessed crossings or signs. The person who wants to make the experimentswill have to be completely alone, unless they accompany a person initiated in the art who has apact with some spirit.The site most suited to the invocations will always be the top of a mountain around whosebase flows a river. If this may not be, a place next to a river should be sought. Or where twoways are crossed forming four paths that go in opposite directions; these paths will representthe four cardinal points of the universe, in any one of which can be the spirit you wish to dealwith in that one hour. It is of absolute necessity that the river is very next to the point of theinvocation, for water and air are the most appropriate elements to the transmission of thought,and these play, together with metals, a great role in the exercise of magical arts. In the case that,by reason of health or any other cause, it is not possible to execute the invocation abroad, itwill suffice to choose a solitary room, hung with black fabric on all the walls and ceilings.Having accomplished this, open the windows and make the following oration:All ready and prepared is the place for the experiments, and there is no blessed nor religioussign in it. My soul is completely free of spirit divine and prepared for the pact with thespirits of Avernus, which I invoke with all my will, without obedience to any other’s mandatewhatsoever.In that hour it is necessary to be entirely without fear of the appearance of the spirit; because hewho is afraid is exposed to torments by the very spirit who appears in response to the spell.The true initiate is fearless; whoso has fear cannot perform the invocation with the true faiththat Lucifer requires to form an agreement. That one he punishes with countless sufferings andeven with death.So that the invocations have true force, it is advisable to have some talisman or amulet withthe cabalistic signs of the Clavicle. Also to draw one of the great circles; not forgetting by thisthe previous warnings. In the section corresponding to the invocations and spells it is explainedhow to execute these.Regarding talismans and amulets, pentacles of Solomon and talismans from the Books of Moses areof course highly regarded in Hoodoo and elsewhere. Our grimoire accordingly deals with these aswell, but it is in its less conventional talismans that it is often most interesting. As in the BoSC itself,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"these will be examined in the section entitled ‘The Solomon Clavicle.’"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"TINSTRUMENTSHE SECOND CHAPTER of this section deals with the instruments that are necessary to magical arts.This material, which I summarise, is derived from True Black Magic; a definitive edition ofthis influential text is planned by Joseph Peterson. The details vary little from the Key ofSolomon, of which, like the True Grimoire, it is as much a form as the MSS versions. The listedinstruments begin with the sword, which appears only fairly late in the evolution of the Solomonicliterature, and is also omitted from the late GV.Then follow the staff and rod; two forms of wand which are also present in the GV and elsewhere.Next the lancet, possibly for drawing blood, but use as a burin is another possibility – see below.There follows the arctrave or hook (some editions of Waite have book, likely a typo rather than anintentional error); the bolline or sickle, the needle, the dagger, a knife with a black handle, andanother with a white handle. Which of these latter is necessary to form the circle, to engravecharacters, or to ward off dangerous spirits is not entirely clear. The Key specifies both knives andthe short lance – whether to be identified with the lancet or the needle here is moot – as necessary forcircles and characters, seemingly intending them to be distributed among these tasks, but alsoapparently provides an option for a smaller array of tools to save trouble.The consecration of the bolline, which I identify with the sacrificial knife in GV, employs the sameconsecratory rite as specified there (‘Orison of the Instrument,’ see TG). As often in Solomonic texts,few of these instruments are actually specified for practical use in the BoSC. I propose that the GVinstrumentum be preferred as the most rational and least redundant of the available versions.Incidentally, a form of the prayer used in the Orison appears in the Hygromanteia; although rarelyfeaturing in other forms of the Key."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CROBESHAPTER THREE deals with the vestments of the magician and their preparation. It is illustratedwith a decidedly un-Solomonic representation of a white bearded magician, in a tall pointedhat and star spangled robe. The text too, while close to TBM, has been tweaked in the same‘wizardly’ direction. As usual the inner vestment is of white linen fabric, the tunic and cap (Cyprianinserts: or pointed hood) are black. These – the tunic and cap – are embroidered with red silkHebrew characters upon the chest and pointed hood. Then our Saint Cyprian has inserted: with goldthreads and silver the stars and other signs.There is no variation from TBM regarding the white lambskin shoes and the names upon the cap thatfollow at the end of this section. It is easy to smile at the conventionalising of the magician, which hasbeen undertaken quite deliberately. The gestures of the magician are interesting, one hand is raised, afinger pointing upwards. The other is lowered holding a long wand (the staff) that reaches to theground, as if to draw a circle or other figure.However, much of the tweaking elsewhere in the text has purpose and intelligence. As with thelarger editions of the Red Dragon, the book has modern passages alongside a compendium of oldermagic. Cyprian’s magical compendium is in fact considerably more extended than the French text; thecore grimoire is far more complete and the extras more integrated. Also the science and modern ideashe sees at work in magic, and occasionally introduces into the magical chapters, are both more subtleand more advanced. The Red Dragon includes random Indian and Chinese engravings, the colonialera’s Oriental mystery, along with mistaken dovetailing of the conjuror’s wand with the divining rodin redundant chapters of padding. Cyprian on the other hand discusses magnetism at work in the solarsystem in a section on planetary talismans. So too his gnomes – of which more anon – resemble sub-atomic particles that pass through more material bodies, ours included. In this light perhaps weshould judge more kindly his deliberate, even subversive, merging of the grimoire magician with thewizard of popular imagination. Remember that the wizard’s hat descends from Iranian originals; sotoo Chaldean theurgists embroidered their robes with signs of the zodiac.The next section deals with the location of magical experiments and is worth quoting in its entirety."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"OCeremony that one must employ to begin the initiationNCE all the instruments of arte, the vestments and other equipment have been prepared,it is necessary to prepare the location for the performance of the intended experiments.You must not forget these premises must absolutely be reserved from all save yourself;do not allow entry to any person who has not previously made a pact with some of the spirits.Ensure that there are two windows, one to the East and another to the West, and that it is in thehighest part of the house. You will cover all the walls with a black fabric, having taken greatcare that neither there nor in the adjacent places is found a religious symbol or figure, oranything that forms a cross.*This, as previously mentioned, derives from the legend of Cyprian, it is most usefully read asacknowledging the pre-Christian origins – and assenting to non-Christian interpretations – of thegrimoires. A lengthy apocryphal digression follows; an anecdotal account of the fate of the famousmagician Athotas. This name is known from occult literature, it is attributed to the master ofCagliostro. A fight ending in murder occurred near his home, and the dagger thrown away lodged inthe window of his magical chamber. The knife, cruciform in shape, made inoperable the workings ofAthotas and his associates. Reduced to desperation his fortune suffered another reverse, he washimself accused of the murder, and lynched. Too late a minion of his noticed the knife stuck in theouter window frame.The text then returns to its theme, discussing the immediate preliminaries of ritual magic;instructions on mental clarity, washing, and ensuring one has a pleasant scent.* The cross is an amulet that renders useless the operations of the ill-prepared magician.When beginning to prepare the experiments, invocations and spells you have first to be free ofprejudices. Clear your imagination of every thought not dedicated to the work to be executed.Wash, then, with clear water of the river, perfumed with powders of rose and iris of Florence.When washing yourself you will say:Purify this water that I am going to use, oh powerful Adonay! That I be purified, free and worthy,empowered to contemplate thee in all your Majesty and Beauty. So be it.Once you have washed your face and the head you will dry yourself, cultivating a sense of tranquilityand calm. Afterwards, with thumb and index finger of the left hand, take powders of rose and linseedand cast them on your neck and beard. The vestments, when you put them on, are also perfumed, foreach article say:Grace of Adonay is placed on my person, with equal will and love, as I cover my body with thisarticle, prepared with all the rules of the art, that I am worthy of those spirits who are invoked. Sobe it."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Prayer for SuccessThe section which follows clearly derives from the above preliminary prayer employed in theprocesses of the True Grimoire and various manuscripts of the Clavicle.Once one has dealt with the vestments, say:In this solemn hour I invoke with my whole will and desire those excellent spirits whoaccompany me in my works: Astroschio, Asath, Bedrimubal, Felut, Anabatos, Sergem,Gemen, Domos, and Arbatel, so that you are propitious to me, illuminate me in all that myhuman intelligence cannot apprehend clearly, repair defects so that there is in attention thegood desire and will in my works. So be it.Aside from Arbatel, who our author has added to a traditional series, the spirits invoked here areidentical with those of the True Grimoire prayer in one of its shorter forms. A more complete formdrawing from the Key (The True Grimoire, restoration by JSK) is given here:During the three days, study the book and during this time, pray five times during the day and fourtimes each night – or as others say, at Sunrise once, at three hours after twice, at Midday threetimes at three hours after four times, at Sunset five times, and six times before going to rest.The Prayer:ASTRACHIOS, ASAC, ASACRA BEDRIMULAEL, SILAT, ARABONAS, IERAHLEM, IDEODOC, ARCHARZEL,ZOPHIEL, BLAUTEL, BARACATA, ADONAI, ELOHIM, EMAGRO, ABRAGATEH, SAMOEL, GEBURAHEL, CADATO,ERA, ELOHI, ACHSAH, EBMISHA, IMACHADEL, DANIEL, DAMA, ELAMOS, IZACHEL, BAEL: SCIRLIN; GENIUMDOMOS!Such prayers have their prototype in the papyri, where – as in the Solomonic grimoires – they areperformed at the solar stations (for instance, PDM XIV. 475–480 and 486). Those of the papyri areessentially prayers for success; success that is in the operations that follow. They are performed atsunrise and other points of the sun’s cycle through the sky. In the Christian period these times formpart of the prayer cycle observed by monks and rung on Church bells. There are Islamic equivalentsalso in the calls to prayer during the day. Originally they likely derive from cults with a solartheology, both Egyptian and Middle Eastern. The Sun god is invoked in the roles of witness andfortuitous power. From these origins they became part of the great synthesis of Western magic.In this context I have recommended the solar prayers of Liber Resh vel Helios as in this practiceboth the solar and timing elements coincide. This is one of many ways in which parts of the Thelemicliturgy complement ancient practice bearing upon the grimoires, and may substitute for some liturgicalelements. These parts generally emphasise the Egyptian rather than the Masonic components, and canthus dovetail with elements drawn from the papyri.This said, the timing element is lost in the text under consideration, but another important aspectbecomes more prominent than usual in the other grimoires.What is remarkable is that in Cyprian’s text the Solomonic names of power are clearly identified aspersons, rather than simply a battery of potent words. There is no doubt about the authenticity of this;but in the grimoires it is more often implied than overt, to the point where modern eyes do not notice"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"it. The spirits invoked in the prayer for success are personalities, guards and friends; a fact Cyprianrefers to more than once.As this has considerable bearing on work with the True Grimoire, the question arises, who arethey? Most forms of this incantation in the Key and elsewhere are shortened and corrupt; a restoredform was used in preparing my True Grimoire (TG 112). Referring to this, given above, an outline ofconsiderable interest emerges, which will hopefully spur further research. Some of the names requirefairly detailed treatment, hence the subheadings in this section.Astrachios Possibly related to Esther (or Ishtar) plus Chiah (Life). It is reasonable to assume that thefirst name is important, and this beginning remains consistent despite some garbling; Mathers’ form,‘Herachio’ is inscrutable, having no basis in the manuscripts. Astrachios is also one of Cyprian’ssuperiors, the sixth.Asacra Bedrimulael This appears to be an angelic or archangelic name, but not a familiar one: ‘andsacred (holy) Bedrimulael.’Silat is the name of a female demon, according to Davidson; hence my selection. The form is notconsistent in the variant texts.Arabonas is close to Anabona, a major name of the Art Almadel system, to which it is likely related.Archarzel suggests Archangel, preceding the name of the angel of Saturn, below.Zophiel He is an important figure in accounts of the War in Heaven; a lieutenant of Michael. TheSaturnine connection is possibly more explicatory of his role here.Baracata is likely to be Baraqijal, a rebel angel (Enoch; Jubilees) who teaches astrology; alsoBarakiel one of the seven archangels, wields lightning; Jupiter; and Barachiel, an angel of the ArtAlmadel.Adonai is by far the premier name of the French blue grimoires, and designedly so. It may wellrepresent Lucifer-Michael in that context. It is the first name also among Cyprian’s superior powers,and conspicuous in the rites and paraphernalia of the Art Almadel.ElohimThe next word, Elohim, gods, is a common Hebrew name in the grimoires, in this context theexplanation of Eliphas Lévi is hard to improve on:... In the belief of the ancients, the world is governed by seven secondary causes – secundii, asTrithemius calls them [De septem secundiis, id est, Intelligentiis, sive spiritibus, orbes postdeum moventibus: Coloniæ, 1567. Waite’s note] – which are the universal forces designated byMoses under the plural name of Eloïm, gods. These forces, analogous and contrary to oneanother, produce equilibrium by their contrasts and rule the movement of the spheres. TheHebrews termed them the seven great archangels, giving them the names of Michael, Gabriel,Anael, Samael, Zadkiel and Oriphiel. The Christian Gnostics named the last four Uriel,Barachiel, Sealtiel and Jehudiel. Other nations attributed to these spirits the government of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"seven chief planets, and assigned to them the names of their chief divinities. All believed in theirrelative influence; astronomy divided the antique heaven between them and allotted the sevendays of the week to their successive rule. Such is the reason of the various ceremonies of themagical week and the septenary cultus of the planets ...In other words the term Elohim represents the gods of the planets and the seven day week, whether inthe form of appropriate angels or otherwise. This understanding – as Syrian in origin as it is Jewish –underpins the Paracelsian usage of Olympians and Olympic spirits. It is the basis and origin of theplanetary magic of the grimoires. In incantations: Elohim means O ye gods! It is also the name of thesecond power in Cyprian’s list of superiors.Samoel The next ‘god’ addressed is Samael, a Mars angel, often indicating a devil, and interchangedwith both Belzebuth and Asmodeus in related legends.Geburahel indicates an angel of Geburah, martial in nature; possibly a title of Samael.Cadato is likely from qadosh, holy.Elohi is Elohe, another common Solomonic godname.Daniel is a rebel angel (Enoch); also the name of both a prophet and a hero.Izachel is Ezeqeel, another rebel angel (Enoch); also the name of a major prophet.BaelBael – also given as Boel – in the grimoires is a chief power of the East, similar or identical toOriens. Under either name he is a tremendously important figure in the history of Western magic; thegrimoires being a latter stage. As mentioned in my Headless One, the name Boel is known from thePDM, and the context is far from arbitrary. On the contrary, his name is associated with a family ofrelated rituals involving lamp divination; other themes arise too in this context, which are highlyilluminating. In the papyri it is obvious that Boel is a high-ranking angel. Interestingly enough anotherimportant angel of this grimoire cycle is mentioned alongside him on a few occasions, namely Aniel(Anael of the GV mirror divination process). Other aspects of the rituals in the papyri concern theHeadless One, another of the Kings, (as in Book 3: The Decans). In these rituals there are manyphrases relating to fire. This surpasses what may be expected in a process involving divination by thelamp; there is no corresponding emphasis on water in the incantations of bowl divination texts:Boel (× 3) ... he that gives light very exceedingly, the companion of the flame, he in whosemouth is the flame which is never extinguished, the great god who sits in the flame, he who is inthe midst of the flame ... ... come into the midst of this flame which is here before you, O he ofBoel, Aniel.PDM XIV.194–200These words may connect with the fire theology of the Chaldean Oracles, and thus to Theurgic ritual,which emphasised light and flame; in a visionary context of divine manifestations no less. Griffith andThompson’s text of another such lamp divination ritual further underline this possibility:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Grow, O light, come forth O light, rise O light, lift thyself up O light, come forth O light of thegod, reveal thyself to me, O servant of the god, in whose hand is the command of today, whowill ask for me.The Leyden PapyrusOther expressions, concerning the staff of a deity, a lake of heaven and so forth, also plainly representa defined mythological context, involving several characters. There are further details which outlinean angelology in which Sabaoth – the God of eternal time – is the superior deity, to whom the angelsanswer. The majority of names and themes contained in these texts are Egyptian. PDM XIV.524however identifies the deity of whom Boel is first servant:Thou art the great god Sabaoth; come down with Boel ... As mentioned, the majority of names employed in these rites are Egyptian. A key phrase, moreconstant than the mention of Sabaoth (a Chaldean name) but evidently identical, is Tagrtat, he ofeternity. To keep a complex matter as simple as possible, this explains several things about Bael andBoel (see Davidson):· In the Zohar, Bael is a name of Raphael. Raphael aka Arlaph is of course a defender againstdemons in early amulets (see Obizuth). The Zohar also speaks of Raphael as charged to heal theearth, and through him ... the earth furnishes an abode for man, whom also he heals of hismaladies. This likely connects with healing spirits such as the decans. His role in the earlierEnoch literature identifies him as one of the Watchers; a guide in the Underworld (Sheol,essentially Hades) and one of the four presences, set over all the diseases and ... wounds ... ofmen. All of which is reminiscent of our Four Kings as leaders of the aerial spirits.· In the grimoires Bael or Baal is a chief of demons, the first of the powers of the East, and chiefamong the Four Kings upon the corners of the earth.· Boel holds the keys to the gates of the four quarters of the earth (Zohar).· Boel is one of seven throne angels, and the angel of Saturn.The connection with Saturn is particularly striking given his role of first servant to Sabaoth. Asmentioned previously, in the mythic structures concerned, Saturn (Kronos) represented the god moretypically identified with the Sun, who with the Moon is a measurer of time. This is likely why thetheurgists possessed an invocation of Kronos while the chief deities named in the Oracles are Apolloand Hecate.Boel is plainly a demiurgic figure, akin to Mikael and Metatron in other angelologies. He fitsreadily into the strata of Jewish and Pagan magic alike wherein Sabaoth, (aka Zervan or Aion) isconceived of as supreme deity.In the papyri concerned, the appearance of Boel and his relation to a chief deity is extremelyemphatic; in the lamp divination genre he plays as conspicuous a role as Anubis does in that of vesseldivination (see ‘Art Armadel,’ TG and ‘Nebiros,’ Geo). Nevertheless, unless tongue in cheek, I findinexplicable the words of Morton Smith regarding these rites in his essay, ‘The Demons of Magic,’which may be found online: Lord Bouel (Bouel is good, old Egyptian god who plays a large role in"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Athe Demotic papyrus) ...The large role is indisputable, but the god Baal of earlier Egyptian texts is thoroughly Semitic; he isalso strongly identified with the Egyptian deity, Set. Boel’s presence in the PDM rituals is actuallyextraordinary, and important. It is important also to note the frequent allusions of these rites to theSun’s authority in the underworld, and his passage therein. Some of the phrases refer to the godresiding in impenetrable darkness but bearing the Sun’s rays, rituals imitate this by using awindowless chamber and so on. There is mention of the setting of the Sun in the incantations, and alsotiming of the final rite at sunset, as well as employment of dawn and noon preliminaries. The relationof the prayer for success to these has been mentioned already.Most of the context of the rites in the PDM, it is important to underline, is utterly Egyptian. Thisreinforces several central themes of the current work; centring on the early significance of decans andsolar theology and their later influence. These particular papyri are demotic rather than Greek, andshow comparatively little sign of foreign influence. The appearance of Sabaoth and Boel in them, inrelation to both fiery and solar themes, is thus highly significant. Here are potent Egyptian solarthemes, at the early stages of the Great Synthesis. There is an internal coherence to these themes asthey begin their mingling with Semitic astrological lore. Themes moreover that – as syncretismdeveloped – grew within hermeticism and theurgy, and remained strong afterwards throughout thegrimoire period. The last three words of the grimoire prayer for success I personally interpret as aphrase: Scirlin – the intermediary spirit of the True Grimoire – and genium domos, house spirit. Thisis of course due to practical considerations first and foremost. Various factors support theinterpretation however, including the placing immediately after Bael. Bael, it would be fair toassume, is instrumental and after the god he serves as the main focus of the invocation. Scirlin asintermediary spirit acting on Bael’s authority then makes sense following such an otherwise climacticname.Our author closes this section with the advice that the operator is now prepared to make a start. Theonly difference in practice, he says, between the neophyte, the initiate and the master is that the novicepleads, the adept persuades and the true teacher commands. This may vary, according to thecharacter, worthiness and energy of the practitioner.THE GRIMOIRE RESUMEDFIFTH CHAPTER discusses the essential qualities necessary to the profession of magic. Onemust make careful examination of one’s faculties, to obtain the desired end in whatever worksare undertaken. A true desire and vocation are required, since magic is not a pastime andwithout total commitment of will and energy nothing can be achieved. Great care and precision arenecessary in the preparation of whatever the magician sets out to do. Any missing detail orimperfection detracts from the work and potentially renders it fruitless. So too the magician mustundertake a constant study of natural things, by which is intended their properties and occult laws towhich they respond. By these exertions and examinations will be understood the supernatural thingwhich is the true aim and objective of magical arts. There is more in a similar vein before he remindsus of what has been the subject all along.Should failure or imperfection nevertheless attend an operation, he must accept it stoically and goon in good heart."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"... the spirits are not always propitious to the invocations of mortals. Sometimes it is necessaryto repeat the conjuration to appear; also forcing them, yes they if do not go, with some talismanor amulet of sufficient power exceeding theirs.The matter of talismans appropriate to the arts has already been raised, and there will be more to besaid anon.The sixth chapter describes a manner of making red ink suitable for pacts and invocations. The firstpart of the process involves familiar ingredients in this role, peach kernels, gall nuts, gum Arabic,soot and river water. These would make a serviceable ink for mundane purposes, only the river waterhints at occult purposes. The second stage is more esoteric; the addition of finely crushed and burnedfern branches taken on Saint John’s Eve, vine shoots treated the same way, having been procured on aMarch Full Moon. All being mixed together, they are then boiled over the five nights following,ceasing by day. Each time the ‘baking’ is begun the spirits are to be invoked to assist. This done it isexposed to the rays of the declining Moon for another night, so that the Moon’s rays impregnate itwith magical virtue. By these means you will have an ink suitable for the writing of pacts, orationsand other documents, by means of which you put yourself in communication with spirits.Chapter 7 deals with the hours and virtues of planets on fairly conventional lines. Amongst routineplanetary instructions are other themes worth extracting. Whenever invocations and spells areconcerned, operate from midnight onwards; when seeking for treasures, mines, waters and suchthings, be sure and use the hours of the following morning before the Sun is out. There is also a mix ofBabylonian fatalism in the powers peculiar to each planet, compared to the general fortuitousness ofSun and Moon."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ICONJURING BY THE SUPERIORSN CHAPTER EIGHT a series of lesser operations is given, comparable to those in the first part ofthe Key of Solomon. Indeed, while derived from True Black Magic and so disowned byMathers and disparaged by Waite, they are part of the literature of the Key. They are not givenhere, as a version of TBM should appear soon, and other versions of these texts are extant. Animportant matter arises in the course of this material however, thus chapter eight requires moreextended commentary.To begin with, some notes on particular TBM operations are appropriate. The incantation in theexperiment of invisibility, here represented in Iberian tradition and present also in TBM, contains animportant clause:I conjure you by the power of Lucifer, your sovereign Lord, and the obedience that you oweto him, that you grant me your aid ...In this particular case the pure Solomonic variant (KoS I.X 51; VKS 308) is quite different. That is, itinvolves no Lucifer; this is much as we might expect.In the experiment of love, hours of Venus are employed and the spirits appropriate to the work aresummoned by he that is your sovereign and Lord. Whether this is God (as in KoS and comparable toSabaoth in ToS) or Lucifer as in TBM depends on which text one consulted; a difference subject inany case to question from various perspectives. Then, to insure the universality of the spell, the fourdemon Kings of the quarters are invoked in very respectful terms, namely Paymon, Egim, Asmoday,Aymemon (sic).Note that, unlike the invisibility process, this format is found in the KoS (see VKS 311) but omittedby Mathers. Despite his comments about such omissions, this ritual was not adapted by a goetic editorfor TBM; Mathers notwithstanding it forms a staple of the genre. The rationale for this respectfultreatment originates with hermetic ideas of the decans, also theurgic processes discussed previously.Despite demonisation of the Four Kings in some sources, this ancient background continues toreassert itself.As we shall see at various points in this grimoire, thwarting angels commanding lesser spirits are ararity; the spirits of invisibility and other purposes are called directly by name without such angeliccompulsion. On the other hand their superiors in their own realm, with or without invocation of God,are routinely invoked. In other words, aerial and chthonic spirits (demons) are not commanded bycelestials (angels), but higher ranking spirits of their own nature.Perhaps some of this approach to spell work can co-exist alongside employing the thwarting angelsin ceremonies of evocation? Say a paradigm wherein the superiors of elemental spirits, rather thanangels to compel them, are deemed appropriate to low magic, while the angelic compellers areretained in conjuring individual spirits?On the one hand there is certainly no shortage of spells where exactly this process is employed.However such a hypothesis is contradicted by the conjuring process of the True Grimoire, wheresuperiors of the spirits play the decisive role in evocation as well. Historically and in terms ofpractice, thwarting angels do not represent a law within a unified Solomonic system. Rather theyrepresent an aspect of, or tendency within, a loose synthesis drawing on varied traditions. In the more"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Egyptian or Hermetic strands of this synthesis, often associated with greater use of plants andminerals, thwarting angels can be very out of synch with the feel and the approach.The last chapter of this section provides useful explanations on the experiments and invocations. Itdeals mainly with the types of spirits, and the fact that they are dealt with collectively is undoubtedlysignificant, and supports my hypothesis of reliance on superiors of appropriate nature rather thanspirits whose status may be higher, but in nature quite different.... invocations to celestial and aerial spirits are advisable to perform at a clear and calm time,terrestrial and infernal ones at the time of storms or under a cloudy sky. Being varied in naturethe spirits, also the form is varied in which they appear. Thus those that are in nature aerial,appear in airy form, those of aquatic nature, in rain form; those of fire, surrounded by flames,and the celestial ones in beautiful and luminous form.There is more to this passage than appears. As regards chthonic spirits it suggests thwarting angelsare inappropriate, since the weather required for the former is not conducive to the latter. It isinconclusive in the case of aerial spirits, which applies to our Kings and their retinues, sincecelestials may be invoked at the same time as aerials. It is interesting to compare the weatherrequirements for conjuring known from the Goetia of Solomon. Note first that the GoS versionparallels one of its likely sources, Scot, whence the text here:The houres wherein principall divels may be bound,to wit, raised and restrained from doing of hurt.Amaymon king of the East, Gorson king of the South, Zimimar king of the North, Goap king andprince of the West, may be bound from the third houre, till noone, and from the ninth houre tillevening. Marquesses may be bound from the ninth hour till compline, and from compline till theend of the daie. Dukes may be bound from the first houre till noone; and clear weather is to beobserved. Prelates may be bound in anie houre of the daie. Knights from daie dawning, tillsunne rising; or from evensong, till the sunne set. A president may not be bound in anie houre ofthe daie, except the king, whom he obeieth, be invocated; nor in the shutting of the evening.Counties or Erles may be bound at anie houre of the daie, so it be in the woods or feelds, wheremen resort not.The only weather requirement here is for fine weather; this might be read as applying only to Dukes,but could equally mean all, as aerial spirits. The requirement for outdoor rites is more emphatic thanin Cyprian; it is for example compulsory in the case of Asmodeus (in Weyer, Scot and the GoS alike).Given his dimensions – should he reveal them – this is obviously essential.Directions associated with the spirits are then discussed, attributing the East to aerial spirits, theSouth aquatic, the North the cold natured spirits and the West for those of a fiery temperament. Therationale for these attributions is obscure, and probably need not detain us; other more reliableattributions are given in The True Grimoire. Indeed the author says that such attributions cannot beentirely relied upon, and it would be conceited to expect all spirits to conform to them. Both factslend great importance to his closing words. Invocations are always to be made towards the fourcardinal points of the Universe, those ruled by the Four Kings afore mentioned. Our work thus gainsnecessary effectiveness, since in this way we eliminate guesswork regarding the location of thespirits whose appearance is desired."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"This examination of the spells from TBM highlights the invoking of superiors, such as Lucifer or theFour Kings, in order to control spirits in spell work or in order to conjure spirits directly.

Theyare beginning to emerge from this obscurity to take their proper place, along with the three chiefs, asrulers of the majority of better known spirits. Nevertheless, the full extent of their role is as yetunsuspected by many. Even some dedicated grimoire purists exclude them from their prior rolesthrough misidentification. The contexts in which they appear in the literature require closeexamination to assist their rehabilitation. Firstly, the textual sources generally available, then therarer sources; emergent from this should be an appreciation of how extensive their traditional roleactually is, despite prior impressions.

That they are necessary for working with the spiritsfrom Weyer’s list, its derivatives and forebears is evident. Collating published information aboutthem takes us through Trithemius’ crystal-lomancy, Agrippa, the Grimoire of Honorius, True BlackMagic and other sources. From these a good picture of their status and role in Solomonic magic canbe gleaned. As the case is important, this evidence requires to be examined in detail before amethodology can be extracted. In the process personality features also appear, as befits therestoration of these key figures to the hierarchy; or as some might prefer to say, pantheon.Turning to the key textual references in the trail from recent times to the golden age of the grimoires:the source of the cabalistic magic of the Golden Dawn was Francis Barrett’s Magus. Barrett’s work,which depends heavily upon Agrippa, provides a transcript of a document on ritual crystallomancyallegedly by Trithemius. The ritual process – published and discussed fairly widely – need not detainus; it is the furniture that requires our consideration. The text describes a design for a frame for thecrystal and an altar top as follows:Let there be engraved a circle round the crystal with these characters around inside the circlenext the crystal (Hexagram with possible Hebrew letter – Vau or Resh – inside; Pentagram;Maltese cross); afterwards the name Tetragrammaton. On the other side of the plate let there beengraven Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael; which are the four principal angels ruling over theSun, Moon, Venus and Mercury; but on the table on which the crystal stands the followingnames, characters, &c. must be drawn in order.So far the instructions are clear, though we might pay attention to the phrasing. Take note of the wordbut, this implies a distinction is to follow. The next paragraph is as follows.First, the names of the seven planets and angels ruling them, with their seals and characters. Thenames of the four kings of the four corners of the earth. Let them all be written within a doublecircle, with a triangle on a table ...It would certainly make life easier for us all if Barrett had illustrated the table; he providedillustrations of the crystal etc. after all. Since he did not, we have to interpret by the strictest rules ofexegesis we can muster. It is not unusual for modern Solomonic magicians to misinterpret thisreference to the Four Kings; taking it to mean the angels whose names appear on the crystal mounting.However, while the term angels is used liberally in the text, it does not appear in relation to the FourKings. A far more straightforward identification is not out of reach, but rushing to conclusions isunnecessary.Consider first Trithemius’ pupil, Agrippa, in particular his Scale of the Number Four, which table"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"is also included in Barrett.Among three pages of columnar correspondences, we find in the first part:Four angels ruling over the corners of the world: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel.As can be seen, the title of this grouping does not mention kings. Directly following is another groupof four entities.Four rulers of the elements: Seraph, Cherub, Tharsi and Ariel.The Four Kings mentioned by Trithemius also share no resemblance of title with these four rulers ofthe elements. Both they and the Four Kings are also named in the 6th & 7th Books of Moses; sincethis mentions Agrippa by name it is obviously secondary and need not be considered in detail.However, it will be necessary later to discuss another group of elemental rulers who are moresimilar to our Kings. As regards the Solomonic textual tradition their names are of too late a vintagefor the present discussion. On the other hand their names are – so to speak – structurally similar to thefour rulers just considered.In the last part of the table, corresponding to the Infernal (literally lower) world we find threeconsecutive rows as follows: ·Four princes of devils, offensive in the elements: Samael, Azazel, Azael, Mahazael;·Four infernal rivers: Phlegethon, Cocytus, Styx, Acheron;·Four princes of spirits, upon the four angles of the world: Oriens, Paymon, Egyn, Amaymon.As can be seen, of all these sets of four the one with the clearest resemblance to the grimoire is thelast. Of all sets considered, only the first set of angels and the third set in this group both mention fourcorners or angles; the third set alone are described as princes rather than angels. To make the identitycrystal clear, the use of the term prince rather than king in this table involves no distinction whatever;the original Latin text gives rex for Oriens and his companions. This is simply a subtlety oftranslation; in English the two words prince and king are often interchangeable. Agrippa’s text alsoconstitutes the classic and most reliable attribution of our Kings. The alternative elemental rulers:Ariel/Aral, Seraph, Tharsis and Kerub appear to be little more than angelic shadows of our chthoniankings. This is unsurprising as the more material spirits are treated so variously in different sources.So far as regards Djin, Ghob, Paralda and Nicksa, they are much later and in any case there is everyindication that they are not really distinct from the Four Kings.Having argued the case at length, the four kings are on the table; if you will pardon the expression.Clearly they are not angels in the usual sense of the word; the various sources discussed in the TrueGrimoire identify them either as demon kings or chiefs of the elementals, if indeed we need todistinguish the two. Also, in the case of the four angels, their planetary role is emphasised first. Theyare only secondarily associated with the four corners/angles of the world/earth, whereas the FourKings are mentioned only in that context. To use the relevant terminology from Agrippa, the planetaryangels are celestial, the kings or princes are Sub-Lunar or Terrestrial. Other terms for the latterwould be Infernal or Chthonic.A summary follows as regards the ritual table, as the matter is important. The circle is a doubleone. The likelihood is that the seven planetary angels would be in the outer circle, the Four Kingswithin. They are thus not ‘mixed,’ and in any case there are many precedents for demon names being"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"written in circles, the best examples being in Clm 849 (Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer’s Manualof the Fifteenth Century, Richard Kieckhefer).Note too that the triangle inside this circle gives it a resemblance to the floor circle employed in theGrand Grimoire, Black Pullet, &c. In any goetic rite the employment of the Four Kings would bewholly understandable. It is a fact that Trithemius nowadays interests magicians working with angels.Nevertheless we can infer that originally the operator could and would work with both the planetaryangels and with elementals. Also, so far as material results are concerned, the presence of the FourKings in the altar design makes perfect sense. This leads naturally on to the next neglected example oftheir appearance in the grimoires."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"TINVOCATIONS OF THE KINGSURNING NOW to the Grimoire of Honorius, the ritual process of this text includes invocations ofthe Four Kings. The text may be seen below, and while the names and directions are muddledthe form is deserving of examination. Before proceeding, take note that Honorius is known toutilise material from True Black Magic, where an even more illuminating mention of the Four Kingsoccurs.Conjuration of the King of the EastI conjure and invoke thee, O powerful King of the East Magoa, by my holy labour, by all thenames of Divinity, by the name of the All-Powerful: I command thee to obey, and to come tome, or that failing, forthwith and immediately to send unto me Massayel, Ariel, Satiel,Arduel, Acorib, to respond concerning all that I would know and to fulfil all that I shallcommand.

Although omitted by Mathers fromhis Key the following ritual derives from the highly regarded Colorno manuscripts of the Key ofSolomon (Kings ms 288. See VKS, Skinner and Rankine). While the ritual of which it is part is anamatory working, the script appears to be highly adaptable, with the appearance of what modernmagicians term a frame ritual. One might be forgiven for imagining the table of Trithemius forming apart of such a modus operandi.O Eastern Asmodee, most shining, most excellent King, who reigns and hath command inEastern Regions, whose Kingdom hath had commencement at the beginning of the World andwhich will endure until the end of the Ages.O thou Paymon, King most glorious, who holds powerful dominion in the Western Regions ofthe Heavens.O thou Egyn, King most strong, whose Kingdom and Empire reaches into the cold regions ofthe North.O thou Amaymon, King most noble, who holds sway over the regions of the South.I invoke you all with power and I pray to you with the authority of the One who spoke andwho hath made all, and who, with one sole word gave birth to the world and whom allCreatures obey.

The conception of the Kings resembles the Abognazar text of the Key (1203Lansdowne MSS); where the kings rule undemonised elemental spirits. (See True Grimoire: ‘Who arethe Spirits?’ and passim). Also, though the names of the four are unstable in many sources, it is clearfrom the TBM rite and elsewhere that the Eastern king enjoys particular status.EAST SOUTH WEST NORTH Superiors*LuciferAsmodai **AstarothBelzeboulKings andOriensAmaymonPaimonAriton"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"EquivalentsOrniasEphippasOnoskelisObizuth DjinGhobParaldaNicksaCo-chiefs,MaeotAsmodai **SatanLeviathanalter egos &/orBaalBelial prominent peers * These are sometimes treated as identical with the kings, sometimes as overlords.** The case of Asmodai is particularly complex, he has a claim on several directions, especially East and South, and is treated both asa Superior and a King."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"AMANUSCRIPT SOURCESN EXCELLENT ACADEMIC TEXT, Invoking Angels (ed.

The Ars Notoria, Liber Raziel and LiberJuratus predominate in parts 1 to 5, crossovers between Jewish and Christian ideas in magicand Kabbalah are emphasised in parts 7 and 8 respectively. In parts 6 and 9 however, suchexpectations give way to other matters; close to, even identical with, goetia although the angelic titleis nevertheless justified for various reasons.Part Nine is ‘Ritual Invocation and Early Modern Science: the Skrying Experiments of HumphreyGilbert,’ by Frank Klaassen. An examination of a sixteenth century magical record, interesting inseveral respects:· It is necromantic in the true sense of evoking the dead;· Humphrey Gilbert, the operator, and adapter of processes, was neither Catholic nor a clericbut a thoroughly secular Protestant;· Among the spirits he deals with is Azazel, who he enlists to assist him evoke Adam, Job,Solomon, Roger Bacon and Cornelius Agrippa. The conjuration of dead magicians reprisesvarious themes in my own work, not least identifying ‘demons’ with deceased initiates andteachers. Subsequent to this Gilbert records a summoning of the Four Kings under the names of Oriens,Amaimon, Paymon and Ægin, which as Klaassen remarks is common in Solomonic manuscripts, andfrequently involves skrying (itself associated from ancient times with necromancy proper, of course).General purpose invocations follow, as might be expected. Interesting as this paper is, it is to Part Sixthat our investigation must pay most attention.Part Six elucidates Antonio da Montolmo’s intriguing work De occultis et manifestis or Liberintelligentiarum. The author of the study in Invoking Angels is Nicolas Weill-Parot, aidedsubstantially by Julian Véronèse, an expert on Solomonic manuscripts. It comes in two parts, the firsta well annotated analytical introduction, the second a bilingual Latin/English critical edition of thetext itself. This is of enormous interest, its value heightened by the notes, as outlined here.Antonio’s work essentially combines elements from one Hermetic and three Solomonic sources.These are an interesting selection and deserve listing:· The Hermetic Book of the 15 Behenian Stars, their stones, herbs and images. This has beenan important source in my own researches. Although Invoking Angels arrived late in thecomposition of this book, the connections between Antonio’s work and my own, in this andprevious volumes, are striking.· The Art Almadel or Almandal. This is the principal Solomonic text in Antonio’s synthesis,providing the spirit catalogue and cosmological details to the KoS. Its angels are not cosmicplanetary forces but elementals of the sublunary world. This amalgamation anticipatesLansdowne ms 1202 and the True Grimoire. A discussion of these third order angels followsin Part 6.· The Clavicle or Key of Solomon provides such practical ritual elements as consecrating and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"working with wax etc.; the liturgical backdrop to the cosmology of the above combination.· De anglica fictione (sic) is the most elusive of the titles. Fictione may refer less to fictus –false, and more to fictilis – clay, earthern, jar, clay figure; and to fictor – sculptor, maker.Especially as Cecco had ascribed a De angelica factione/factura (the angel maker) not toSolomon but to Apollonius. Chapter 1:1 of Liber intelligentiarum distinguishes four directions allocated to the four cardinalsigns, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, heads of the elemental triplicities in the zodiac. Chapter1:2 identifies four kinds of Intelligences or spirits, specifies their sphere of operation as the lower,not the celestial world whence their types and energies are derived. Oriens is named as anIntelligence of the East and Fire, distinct from spirits of other directions and elements. The varioustypes are proper to this or that science or operation, rather than another. I:3 specifies this fourfoldastrological pattern, with the Four Kings implied, as the reason for performing magic at thecrossroads.This sets the tone for the entire text, and has considerable bearing on the matter of the Four Kings inSolomonic magic. He places an interesting emphasis on the first decan of Cancer, giving it the titleheart of the North and attributing great importance to it in the lore of magicians. This likelyoriginates in his understanding of Hermetic literature concerning the decans, particularly Sothis. He isaware that Cancer rather than Aries can be equivalent to the horoscope, that is, the prototypicAscendant. Antonio draws on Cecco d’Ascoli, without naming him – wisely, since this magician,who also mentions our Four Kings, was destroyed by the Inquisition. They resemble each other intheir understanding of magic, and in striving to remain within Christian theology. Thus both portraythe angels available to magicians in the same way; as sublunar spirits, whose nature is determined byhigher astrological forces (superlunary angels), while they are aerial spirits. Christian though this is,we may easily see echoes of Neoplatonist ideas as expressed by Plutarch and others in late antiquity(see my comment on the ‘Vision of Er’ in Geo II). Indeed, the concept of powers of the air, good andevil, is found in Greek philosophy as early as the 4th century BCE.For Christian theology the higher angels, following Aquinas, were identified with the angelic orderof Virtues. The lower ones, involved in the actual magic, were Powers, a class identified by SaintPaul as fallen or devilish. Antonio appears to identify them more with the thwarting angels, whilesimultaneously blurring distinctions from the spirits under the Four Kings in a wholly understandableway. Cecco and Antonio are linked too in their connection of astrological magic with spirit magic, acombination that – angelic or no – flouts Albertus Magnus’ denunciations in Speculum astronomiæ.Antonio asserts too that the chiefs among these lower Intelligences are identical with the Pagan gods.Here too there are echoes of Neoplatonism, which distinguished between daimones and divine figuresfor whom they were supposedly mistaken by earlier poets. That is, since the later idealisedphilosophical conception of Zeus would never transform himself into a beast, it had to be a daimonicsubordinate who had done so. In Plutarch’s Mysteries of Isis and Osiris such ideas are taken further,the eponymous deities had originally been daimones, but evolved into deities.For a more pragmatic, less theologically paranoid magician, it is simple common sense that a spiritwho assists him in a day to day matter is not the chief angel guiding this or that planetary sphere in itsorbit, or this or that element in its most cosmic operations. The expectation would be a lesser spirit ofthe same hierarchy but much closer to home. Whether angelic or daimonic depends on who happens tobe defining aerial spirits at the time, or who may be listening. In any case, the angels most concernedin magic are plainly close to humanity, operating in the sublunar sphere, and thus one with the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"mediatores of theurgic eschatology.My understanding of Liber intelligentiarum differs from Weill-Parot’s insofar as – in my opinion –he downplays the existing astrological elements in Solomonic magic overmuch. The Exhortation toRehoboam in the KoS MSS is a potent corrective:Pay attention, my very dear son Rehoboam, to the exactness of this art of mine ... to theprocedures, in which the whole matter of [hygromanteia or spirit conjuration] lies, because it isnecessary before anything ... to master the observations of the planets and of the signs of theZodiac ...In fact Solomon had been represented as an expert astrologer from at least the 2nd century CE. Thedecan spirits of the Testament, prototypes which underpin the spirits of the Almadel among others,represent a potent astrological element indigenous to the Solomonic corpus from the beginning.Moreover, as shown in Part Two, the ToS describes Hermetic images of the fixed stars. Finally,Albertus Magnus certainly recognised Solomonic magic as involving one of three classes ofastrological image, with which Antonio himself is here concerned.So, Solomonic and Hermetic magic were not strangers to each other in the earlier, formativeperiod. A magician such as Antonio, even with his nods towards Christian orthodoxy, was quitecapable of recognising the commonalities of the genres. This aside, as Weill-Parot notes, Antonioappreciated that Solomonic is more outwardly Christian than its Hermetic stablemate. So too he isinvolving astrology to a greater degree than the typical Solomonic text, which rarely involves aspectsand houses so much as lunar tides and planetary days and hours. He likely saw this as more of arestoration than an innovation.Chapter 1:6 speculates concerning the disturbances caused when magicians call spirits from thefour parts of the world. One line of inquiry is that, being of opposed types and powers, they are liableto fight – a theme encountered in ‘Volcanic Conjurations.’ Another is that they are displeased atconstraint by divine power, a matter he discusses with conspicuously less enthusiastic orthodoxy in alater chapter. Also he advises against concurrent invoking of the Chiefs (Oriens, Amaymon, Paimonand Egyn); as the disturbances they are capable of, especially in elemental opposition, are greaterthan those of their subordinates. Elemental antipathy is explicit here, as implicit in the line of thinkingis elemental sympathy, towards which astrological ideas are geared in his other chapters.Chapter 1:7 reiterates the widespread conception of the spirits of the East as nobler than andsuperior to the others. Concerning their operations he speaks cryptically of appropriate or idealmagical timing (celestial points, hours and moments). The way in which the Eastern, fiery spirits areperceived, and the consciously Solomonic context in which they appear, are presentiments of the TrueGrimoire. Chapter 2:1 reintroduces a familiar subject, the primacy of the Sun among the ElementalKings and spirits. He is the candle of such stars, the principal among them and Time is his attribute.He is involved in all operations of the eastern Intelligences, in the day, before noon, with Aries orLeo ascending. Operations of kings require Leo, lords Aries, nobles Sagittarius; the three fire signs.Concerning tyrants, Aries rising in the day and hour of Mars, positions of Sun and Mars should begood, preferably with the Sun in a fire sign. Such material dominates this section; thereafter he speaksbriefly of the Moon, waxing by day or night, and of conditions regarding other Intelligences. Theemphasis on the Sun and fiery spirits is very notable, and accords with the emphasis in the TrueGrimoire. Note also the profusion of names including Heli, Helio &c. in the rites and paraphernaliaof the Art Almadel."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 clarifies the context the magician is thinking and writing in, references to the Art Almadelof Solomon are explicit. Altitudes of elemental and directional angels, the Powers, are mentioned.Astrological and elemental considerations involving altitudes and Intelligences occupy most of thesections. The last part concerns Intelligences corresponding to the altitude of the ascending sign at thetime of birth. One of these is dispatched to each child by the prince of the altitude. While this spirit isapparently seen as opposing the good angel – the so-called Guardian Angel of Abramelin et al – it isdifficult not to see the Hermetic concept of a nativity angel therein.Envisioning Antonio’s magic as like the Art Almadel but with more sophisticated astrological rulesand a deeper background reckons without chapter 4. This forms a spectacular contrast to pureceremonialism as Solomonic magic is often understood. It concerns the making of magical Imagesand Phylacteries, and similar things and although not the last chapter may be understood asclimactic; the chapter is intensely practical. He discusses the images of the ancients, the differenttypes and influences concerned, in general terms. He clarifies that images, rings, phylacteries andother things made are all involved in the same discussion. There are astrological ones, magical ones,and those that combine the two; this echoes Albertus in Speculum astronomiæ, but endorses all threerather than denouncing two.The making of magical images is explicitly linked to the Elemental Intelligences, and in the mostsignificant terms. So too is the use of wax, not in order to make a pentacle or candle as in the ArtAlmadel, but a magical image as in the Key (KoS.I.X. & II.XVIII. where Asmodal in invoked). The useof virgin wax, as prescribed therein for images, is also specifically mentioned. This is magic of adifferent kind than the collective summoning conjurations. The operator makes an image appropriateto their purpose, as described in Hermetic works quoted by Agrippa for example. The names ofIntelligences are written upon it (or equivalent magical kharakteres) with burning of perfumes,honouring of the Intelligences and kindly and benevolently invoking them, without compelling themby the divine power. Here again we are probably seeing originally pagan Hermetic ideas segued intothe Solomonic format. Thus Antonio speaks of characters revealed by the spirits, rather than by Godor his angels, with which Weill-Parot – who assumes Solomon is followed here – takes issueunnecessarily. The following from Conybeare’s Christian Demonology summarises Origen (ContraCelsus VIII.61), and shows that early Christian interpretations of Pagan magic dovetail with thepractices Antonio advocates:These demons have cajoled men into worshipping them, have taken names which their votariesare careful to ascertain; and they have various powers, and favourite charms and herbs whichthey individually prefer, as well as different forms which admit of symbolic portraiture onengraved stones.This is undoubtedly a reference to decan magic, as in Liber Sacer, especially as Celsus referenceddecans in the text Origen is responding to. Given the solar emphasis and other compatible matterspresent in Antonio’s commentary, a useful rite for these operations may be found in the consecrationfor all purposes (PGM IV.1596–1715). I have remarked elsewhere how this rite has similarities withthe True Grimoire general purpose consecration (TG, The Third Part: ‘The Knife’). The PGM rite isspecifically designed for images, rings and phylacteries; precisely what Antonio is discussing.Lest this be thought unusual in grimoire magic, a magical text translated in another of Fanger’ssplendid compilations offers an interesting comparison: The Book of Angels, Rings, Characters andImages of the Planets (attributed to Osbern Bokenham). This is translated and introduced in"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Conjuring Spirits by Juris Lidaka. Here we find spells involving making images of spirits in newwax. The following outline takes one example (55). The image gives power over spirits, particularlyBaal, who is their lord. It is of new wax and represents a man with distorted feet. It is sprinkled withspecial water, daubed with blood of a black cock, and marked with sigils of Sun and Moon over aperiod of nine days, and then subjected to more magical processes. A hazel wand is used to dominatethe image later in divination, accentuating a resemblance to a GV related spell from the GrandGrimoire (TG, ‘Natural & Supernatural Secrets: Spell XI’).Several of the stages listed here make sense in terms discussed by Antonio, and indeed yours truly:Baal as a name of a lord of spirits; misshapen, missing or bestial feet; the rule of Sun and Moon overaerial spirits at the roots of theurgy; employment of magical characters, etc. Another image of aSaturnian spirit follows, rendered in lead, then two more, one of Saturn, one of Mars.Chapter 5 deals with reasons for choosing the places where the operation is performed. Heclarifies here, if it were needed, that planetary attributions to these spirits do not imply connectionwith the Intelligences of the planetary orbs; rather, Intelligences bestowing or inflicting energiesunder that planet. He identifies the lower Intelligences with the gods of the ancients, and states hisopinion that this explains planetary operations in the grimoires. Here too Conybeare’s summarising ofOrigen is relevant:The localities most affected by demons, says Origen, are temples and shrines where incense isburned and blood offerings made.His identification of good energies on this level is with the Powers, but the overlap with evil spiritsis apparent, and not reliant on his interpretation. He discusses also the matter of appropriate weather,in terms scarcely distinguishable from the GoS, or indeed the Book of Saint Cyprian. In all this he islikely commenting on works of the 13th century.Chapter 6 concerns ‘Reasons for Exorcisms, Circles, Characters, Pentacles, Suffumigations andSimilar Things.’ This is a commentary on the rites of Solomonic magic, and fairly brief. While itdeals with matters of protection without diminishing its importance in appropriate circumstances,there are some important instructions dealing with exceptions. So too he distinguishes betweencharacters given by God, and characters given by the evil spirits. Weill-Parot objects in the notes thatSolomonic characters (pentacles, inscriptions etc.) are all God given, so the distinction must originatewith Antonio. However it is present in later goetic tradition, while Solomonic magic has its owndebts to earlier traditions where characters were revealed to Chaldean theurgists, as likely as togoetes. Those given by the spirits are the signs [employed by] those [magicians] who want thecreatures to operate in their honour. In these circumstances, already mentioned in respect of imagemaking, the use of appropriate perfume, ink and paper, with a benevolent prayer addressed to themthe spirits are pleased at the honour done them and work hard to achieve the purpose of the phylacteryor what not. These images and phylacteries he thoroughly distinguishes from pentacles and otherdevices familiar from Solomonic magic, the rites of the bath and of the circle etc included. Heemphasises here, as elsewhere, that the most efficacious rites are those performed by a Catholiccleric.However, there is a but, under which he includes the suffumigations and other items such as paperand ink, employed in sacrifice to the spirits. These items must be exorcised in their own names withbenevolence and a prayer addressed to them. This is a most ambivalent prescription an instant afterinsisting on the superior efficacy of Catholic rites. The next two sections, the climactic part of the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"entire text, reiterate further. Operations performed through placation and power of the spiritsemploy benevolent prayers addressed to them. Otherwise the exorcist would absolutely not succeed.This is clear and there is no doubt about it. Further, when seeking a boon from the spirits, theoperator behaves purely and chastely without reciting the divine prayers, having bathed in unblessedwater from a spring or river whose waters are clear. The applicability of virginity and of clearsubstances to this kind of spirit reprise earlier chapters.The interest of this document, and its relevance to working with the Four Kings in various ritualcontexts should be apparent, and recommendation enough for further reading."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"RTHE SOLOMON CLAVICLEETURNING TO THE CYPRIAN GRIMOIRE, Book 2 chapters I to 9 bears the title ‘The SolomonClavicle: the Secret of Secrets.’ It begins with a staple of the Solomonic genre, a version ofSolomon’s exhortation to his son (see TG 51). It then moves on to a lengthy treatise ontalismans, a portion of which originates in TBM. It is interesting to see a conception of the Key thatconcerns only Solomonic pentacles; even though many of the talismans actually given are, so to speak,Cyprianic. The exhortation is omitted here, and that part of the talismanic section that may beexamined elsewhere (KoS, VKS). As regards the other talismans I give a fuller account, andrecommend them as deserving of a future translation by a specialist.The preamble to the talismanic section gives credit to the ancients. This is semi-formulaic asregards the Egyptians and Chaldeans, but knowledge and use of Hellenistic themes is evident.Naturally it mentions King Solomon’s ring as the most famous of all talismans. Historically howeverthe oldest of its talismans involves Abracadabra, this it is unashamed to enumerate in Greek gematria.Elsewhere Apollonius of Tyana is mentioned. In fact Cyprian’s magic, although Christian, is notafraid to work with pagan gods as benign agencies. This represents a strand of ChristianNeoplatonism not uncommon in the grimoires, but rarely so forthright as regards deity names. In thisas in much else the influence of a Paracelsian strand may be detected.The second chapter of the talismanic treatise has several interesting points. The first of these shouldbe considered in the light of the goetic hoodoo approach recommended at various points ofGeosophia. The chapter is entitled ‘Magnetised Talismans’ and these are the opening words:It is advisable to touch the talismans before using them with the lodestone which, as we know,has the propert to attract all the powers of nature.The text which follows includes remarks on magnetism operating in the solar system, and appears toconfuse electro-magnetism with gravity. It is nevertheless correct that magnetic force is universal.Also, as readers of earlier volumes of the Encyclopædia Goetica will be aware, the lodestone had aprestigious role in ancient magic, perpetuated in the True Grimoire and in hoodoo. His scientificjustification is omitted here, and our examination resumes at the point where the text returns to themain topic. Magnetic force, he observes, attracts people, animals, spirits and elements. He then citesa Rabbi Yram Radiel on the forms of talismans – the correct name is Isaac Radiel, known frommagical literature and given correctly in TBM – this source speaks in accordance with the Clavicle:Talismans can be made from all the seven metals appropriate to the seven planets. With thebinding virtue that the lodestone confers, they are given wide ranging powers; greater than thequalities of those made from one metal and under the influence of a single star. In order toemploy them, place them together, in a green bag, with filings of steel and gold, and sevengrains of wheat as an offering to the seven planets. This ceremony must be performed at dawnon a Sunday. Wear it thereafter over the heart, hung from a thin cord of green silk. Rememberthat such a talisman confers favours to him that bears it: in business, journeys, gambling, inlove, combat, etc. However, to acquire these benefits you must become worthy of them."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 deals with just such a talisman, and is entitled ‘The Great Dominator Talisman or the Keyof the Pacts.’Here is the true key that opens all the doors of unknown sciences, for the people who, by itsrites and good faith, are worthy to own the wisdom, the precious gift that many wish for andfew manage to attain. The key, or clavicle, serves for all manner of pacts, for by means of it thespirits are forced to appear to the person who employs it in the invocations. This key orclavicle is renowned as the great Dominator Talisman. It is thus considered first among thetalismans; with it Solomon was able to subjugate the spirits, who were always humble to itspower. This key is formed of the metals gold, brass and bronze, made on the morning of Sundayin the first hour of the sun. It takes the form of a parchment with Hebrew words. It can beconstructed in metal, or written on parchment. In order to avail oneself of this talisman, the firsthour of the Sun is chosen, on a Sunday. A small piece of lodestone must be added to it ...An incantation follows in which the Trinity is invoked with the grace and light granted to the operatorby the angels. So too the operator claims authority as being made in the image of God. He requestspower over the seven planets, which are named. In the divine names invoked he requires dominationof all above and below the Earth and waters:... to obtain by your mediation, the absolute dominion of all creatures, spirits and elements.This talisman is placed in a red bag and operator and talisman alike are perfumed with frankincenseand myrrh. Thereafter on a Sunday at dawn iron filings are added to the magnet and seven grains ofwheat added to the bag as an offering to the planets, and a prayer recited."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CTHE GORGON, THE DRAGON AND THE GOATThe GorgoneionABALISTIC PENTACLES ASIDE, pictorial symbols, such as the gorgoneion, together with naturalobjects, undoubtedly preceded the use of written talismans. The apotropaic wands of earlyEgypt bore not hieroglyphs, but pictures of fierce theriomorphic gods. The Seal of Solomondefers to the gorgoneion, supreme amulet of antiquity. Just as Maximus of Ephesus warded offdemons with Hecate’s sigil, so the face of the Queen of Hell invokes the ultimate authority over them.Among the special talismans our author numbered the Red Dragon and the Infernal Goat; the imagesof Pruslas and Barbatos. Our sources are full of dragons as hieroglyphs; whether winged or of thewater, limbed or sinuously serpentine. The Three-Headed Dragon of the Testament speaks eloquentlyof the Maioral of Kimbanda, transcending and emanating the three chiefs of the grimoires. Thegreatest dragon is Ouroboros, the serpent with his tail in his mouth, the dragon of eternity. A majorsymbol of the amulets of late antiquity, it belongs in this place.The Red Dragon TalismanChapter four of this section returns to the subject of the Red Dragon, this time in the form of atalisman. An enlarged account also appears in BoSC III pt. 2; where we are enlightened as to itsprecise form:... [Moses] had among his talismans and amulets a small red Dragon, a rare carved metalobject of great significance.The resonance with ancient imagery, from the Testament and the decans, from Revelation, fromThracian iconography; this talisman represents an emphatic recuperation of the demonised image.The chapter includes details of Solomon’s building the Temple, with the assistance of Hiram Abiff.Solomon initiated the architect and conferred the Red Dragon talisman upon him. By means of thistalisman Hiram had authority over many thousands of masters, companions and apprentices, whichhas a Masonic tone. Solomon instructs him thus:By virtue of this Dragon they will all obey you blindly and your orders will be perfectlyinterpreted by them; but it is necessary every day at the rising of the sun to say the wordsthe famous magician Anacharsis taught Moses: Jobsa Jalma, Afia. This said you will give tothe Dragon a grain of purest camphor and a wheat grain in its bag of red cloth.He is then taught an incantation and assured of universal dominion, wealth and wisdom and a myriadother gifts by means of the Red Dragon. This most interesting talisman is to be made from the sevenmetals at sunrise on a Thursday, the Sun and Moon being conjoined. It was, we are assured, the rarestand most choice magical treasure of Egypt, which Moses had acquired from his master in magic.Anacharsis incidentally was a Scythian philosopher (6th century BCE) from the Black Sea, accountedone of the Seven Sages of ancient Greece."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"So too, partially repeating the above instructions, the magician must be clean and perfumed, and atsunrise the words given must be said. A grain of camphor and a lodestone are placed in the bag withthe talisman, which is worn over the heart. Following these instructions carefully all these gifts willbe his and all doors will be opened to him. Note too the burning of camphor and cognac in theevocation process of the Red Dragon grimoire."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Infernal GoatBesides the Red Dragon talisman, another similar in nature is mentioned at the beginning of thistreaty; the Infernal Goat.This refers to the encounter in the Introduction, of the author with the two spirits as living imagesappearing out of the grimoire. His description of them is ambivalent; they represent arch-demons, asof course does the gorgoneion from one perspective. They therefore confer tremendous power overlesser spirits, and their images are accordingly potent talismans. The use of animal forms in the magicof the lunar mansions, as spirit guides or clan totems, as forms adopted by the shaman in theOtherworld, all approach the same subject in different ways.The diabolic spirits can assume every kind of form, both of people and of animals. Mostusually, nonetheless, they assume those of dragon or goat; although sometimes they appear in theform of cat, hen, crocodile, etc. Do not be afraid, when performing the invocations, of anyforms in which the spirits appear. The operator must be ready to defend himself with themagical instruments, in case the spirits want to cause him harm. With these talismans, he canforce obedience upon them. The Infernal Goat appears giving sorrowful bleats like a soul inpain, and the Dragon, giving loud and hoarse howls and emitting fire from its eyes and mouth. Inspite of the imposing dragon form, it is to be feared less than the goat, as the goat is the symbolof perfidy and deceit. The operator will therefore have to be on his guard and beware when thespirit’s appearance seems innocent. The Goat represents dissimulation and cunning: it is said ofthis animal that it has Art and a pact with the Devil."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The implied significance of such an amulet is plainly that the bearer is protected by a pact with astrong and cunning spirit. The grimoire continually and effortlessly moves between considering thegoat and dragon as living creatures, as pictures coming to life from the magical book, and as metalamulets carried in red flannel bags. Magically, the image is the spirit. The resemblance to the makingof gods in Hermetic and Theurgic talismanic art is substantial.The Ring of SolomonThis ring should be made of purest gold, at sunrise on a Sunday, in the month of May. It is to beset with an emerald, upon which is graven the Sun and on the opposite side of the ring, upon thegold, the Moon. Then engrave around the circumference of the ring with the burin of new steel,the following words Dhabi, Habi Alpha and Omega, bearing in mind this has to be done inHebrew characters; as this is more pleasing to the spirits it names.For this talisman to acquire great magical powers, touch it with the lodestone at sunrise andmake the following salutation: Lord Almighty Alpha and Omega, substance and spirit of allcreation, remembered daily in my soul, grant your divine protection in the works to beexecuted on this day.Having faith, patience, and perseverance and observing all the virtues, you can obtain a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"dominion so great that even kings need your help and be beyond harm from anyone of any status.You will be able to acquire all kinds of knowledge and prosper in the work you undertake.This ring is placed on the middle finger of the right hand."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Other TalismansNext follows the Great Talisman of Constellations involving seven metals suited to the planets. Thetext regarding this is obscure, but by contrast with the following apparently means that silver forVenus predominates. The work is performed between ten and twelve at night, and a dedication madewith an invocation of all seven powers, but emphasising Venus. This prayer is repeated over thirtynights, exposing the talisman to the planetary rays. The initial rules relating to ring and Red Dragonare also recommended, naming those talismans specifically.Another Celestial Talisman follows, in a very skeletonic form. Whereas silver dominated in theformer, gold must dominate in this, and the emphasis in the prayer also be made on the Sun rather thanVenus. In both all the planets are invoked, but only the one body is actually named. The exposure isonly for a week, to the solar rays, making the prayer at sunrise.The contrast of Sun and Venus, gold and silver, night and day, even week and month is marked.They appear to be more than two of a hypothetical planetary set. The use of several metals is unusual;probably indicating a Paracelsian rather than Solomonic manner of thought. In fact an illustration ofthese talismans bears the legend (upon the face of a talisman): Celestial Talisman Paracelso. Otherfactors, like grouped planetary symbols in a hexagram, resemble other known Paracelsian forms.The next talisman employs similar ideas, but is clearly not regarded as Celestial; it is called theExterminating Talisman. This talisman is made between 10 and 12 on the night of Saturn. All sevenmetals are used, but the dominant one is lead. On 30 nights between 10 and 12 it is exposed to theplanetary influence. The previous rules are employed.The wonderful power that it possesses over evil spirits is very great, by virtue of the Cross ofCaravaca, the scorpion and cabalistic circles that contains it. The one that uses this talismanwill be able to impose their will upon the spirits and if it is placed upon a person possessed bya demon, in that very instant they will be released.The Cross of Caravaca is a wonder working Christian cross of Spanish legend; bearing two crossbars, the higher shorter than the lower. There is a resemblance in the scorpion to one of theSolomonic pentacles of Mars and a version of it heads these three talismans which is far more goeticin appearance. Accompanying the descriptions are three images, two represent the face and reverse ofthe Celestial Talismans; these differ in composition and consecration, not apparently in design. Thethird bears a Scorpion and the Cross of Caravaca. Given the proximity of the goetic Scorpiontalisman to this section the method of consecration might also be applied more generally.Following this group is described a talisman of Isis. This, according to Sirdar Ikbar Ali Shah, isknown from a Spanish edition of the Enchiridion and elsewhere. It is sufficiently important to appearon the cover of our present book of Saint Cyprian, as is the Red Dragon. The Egyptian syncretisminvolved is evidently invented, and incorporates a folk magic standard in the form of a four leavedclover. Red clover is however found in North Africa as well as Europe and Western Asia. Suchsyncretism and folk magic occurring together in a grimoire context renders an account worthwhilehere.Isis Talisman"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Isis, known by the title of Good Goddess, was the beneficent divinity of the Egyptians. Her mainattribute was the four leaved clover, one of the rarer plant forms known ... from this clover ismade the Isiac emblem. The four leaved clover is not a different species, but is ordinary clover(trifolium pratense) that, by the will of Isis, has a rare leaf with four lobes. The plant that hasthis divine distinction never blooms and hence it cannot reproduce. The Egyptians consecrated aspecial cult to Isis, initiating into her mysteries only those who found the four leaved clover.This discovery was, in the eyes of the patriarchs, a clear sign of the protection of the goddess.During the solemn ceremony of initiation, the neophyte offered to Isis, at the time of thesacrifices, the leaf they had found, and received from the hands of the high priest a four leavedclover of sacred silver. A spoken pledge [Spanish: prenda] came with the talisman; that itwould play a powerful role in the main acts of life: The fiancé offers it to their affianced as alove token; the mother places it around the neck of her son as a protection against all theadversities of life, and within the family it is passed from parent to child as a sacred symbol ofprosperity. Happiness accompanies this talisman. It was even placed in coffins, in pioustestimony to its efficacy in the otherworld. In order to comprehend the exalted status it heldamong the Egyptians, it is necessary to know that they carved it upon monuments inhieroglyphics. The four leaved clover appears on the Obelisk of London, called Cleopatra’sneedle, and on most of their funerary books and the famous Isiac tablet that portrays themysteries of Isis, which is in the royal gallery of Turin.The priests of this goddess secured their purple tunics at the shoulder with a pin in the form ofthe four leaved clover. It is to be made of silver and platinum in the hours from 9 to 11 at nighton a Monday when the Full Moon is on the horizon. The invocation is made in this manner:Oh, solitary and mysterious star, you that walk eternally in that space without limits,spilling your melancholic light on this planet called earth, I, humblest of mortals, request inthis solemn hour that you fix your rays and favour upon this metal that bears your image,imparting to it the magical virtues necessary, so that by its mediation I can obtainhappiness, good fortune, health, power and love during the course of my life on this planet.If you grant my request, I promise in gratitude for your favour, to remember you in everyhour of my life.This invocation is repeated three times during 30 nights at the same hours, from 9 to 11. Inorder to use it, the formula given here is to be followed.Chapters 5 and 7 – entitled ‘Ordinary Talismans’ – enumerate various planetary talismans andinstructions which need not much concern us here. The first group are obviously from True BlackMagic and thoroughly conventional. An interesting aspect of the account of them attributes regard forplanetary metals in talismans to Paracelsus. Legendary accounts of Moses, Solomon and Arabmagicians regarding talismans appear thereafter.Interpolated for comparison below are two talismans from the Magical Elements. These alsoexhibit Paracelsian influence. The polygonal frame and placement of astrological symbols resembleseveral Paracelsian talismans from other sources. However there are interesting differences. Onlyone image is illustrated in the text, I have reconstructed the other from the textual description. The‘Sanskrit’ characters are in fact a Cyprianic magical alphabet, also included in the MagicalElements.Interestingly, while planetary, the other five planets are not mentioned.

Hecateis written over her head in Sanskrit. On the other side is a hexagon, with a magic square of ninesquares with the magical value of 369. The operation is to be done in the Spring, when theMoon enters the first degree of Capricorn or Virgo, in favourable aspect to Jupiter or Venus.When completed it is necessary to wrap it in a piece of white silk. This talisman preventsepidemic and contagious diseases; protects travellers from thieves and other misfortunes, andespecially favours merchants and farmers in their work.Saturn talismansThese talismans are manufactured from pure soft lead on a Saturday from the first until the ninthhour. The magic square has three cells adding to 15 [represented in text within a hexagon likethe first]. An equal sided polygon with eight sides [surrounds the image on the first side]. Onone side is the symbolic figure representing Time armed with his scythe in an attitude ofreaping, with an hourglass beside him.

The talisman must be produced when Saturn is in goodaspect, when the moon enters the first degree of Taurus or Capricorn. When this is done it iswrapped in a piece of black silk. This talisman is used to help women in childbirth deliveringthem happily from this state without pain. Forecasts prosperity in all things. If a gentleman hasit in his left boot, his horse can not hurt or be hurt. But it has the opposite effects, like the othertalismans, if manufactured in bad circumstances and under unfavourable aspects.Chapter 7 details how to make amulets and talismans possess virtues and efficacy, in a mannersimilar to the Celestial and Exterminating Talismans. As it represents a useable methodology it isworth giving in full.How to make amulets and talismans possess virtues and efficacyTo provide the necessary virtues of talismans and amulets, it is appropriate for the person whois to use them, to contemplate the stars, exposing the talisman on a small new dish to receive thebeneficial influences. Half the time, that is, each half hour, turn it over to expose the other side.Do this for thirty nights, from ten to eleven.Every night at this time, recite the following prayer four times, having placed your right handon the talisman or amulet and gaze at the starry sky.Oh!

I pray also that the good spirits of light,Adonay, Ariel, Jehovah and Mitratran Lord, will adorn it with gifts of wisdom, in order toachieve the magical virtues I ask for.A second time I ask the stars, elements and created spirits, listen to my plea in this solemnhour, and endow this work with power, that through them I achieve the many wonders I seek,and be forever admired by my peers.To achieve the desired benefits by means of talismans and amulets, acquiring the supremeperfection the constant practice of the virtues is necessary.

Its chiefinterest lays in the fact the angel summoned is Azrael rather than Anael. Azrael, and variantsthereof, is a name of the Angel of Death in Jewish and Islamic lore. In the latter he is identifiedwith Gabriel. An angel who has a distinctly sinister reputation; his name is also variously invoked inexorcisms and inscribed on talismans of protection.The instructions resemble those of the GV closely; the mirror is still of steel, although the names arenot written in blood. The incantations also involve variation. The first prayer, said observing theMoon at the window, is as follows:Oh, eternal and universal king, thou who reignest over all things and are cognizant of allmysteries, deign to grant the gift of the all-seeing eye and let the angel Azrael deign toappear in this mirror.In this form of the rite the perfume is not specified as saffron. The coals must be formed of laurel, andperfume is cast on them three times, saying:In this, by this, and with this mirror, I desire Wisdom, by Supreme Will, and by mediation ofAzrael the angel of light.This prayer is repeated three times, casting perfume on the coals each time. After which breathe onthe mirror as in the GV form and recite this prayer:Come, Azrael, and indulge me with thy company in the name of Him that commands and cando all, and possesses infinite wisdom.Come Azrael, in the most holy name of Jalma; come by His name unto this mirror with loveand joy and peace, and show me the things that remain hidden to my eyes.These differences are fairly slight, and the form less polished than the conjurations of the olderversion. Nevertheless, the adaptations are of interest, certain factors considered especially.After this invocation is recited, raise your eyes to heaven and say: Oh Supreme Spirit, you whoset in concerted movement all things hear my vows; grant my wish! Order Azrael to appear inthis mirror and fill with satisfaction this thy servant, that blesses Thee that sublimely reignfor ever. Amen.When you have recited these invocations, lay thy left hand upon the mirror and extend yourright toward infinite space.Repeat this ceremony for 48 days, by whose end or perhaps earlier, you will see the angelAzrael, in the form of a beautiful child. Then you can ask whatever you want him to show you inthe magic mirror.This is an important process, even though an adaptation of a rite that appears in an earlier volume.Certain details are significant; the four names are retained from the GV, but recur throughout the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"volume with emphasis. This form of divination is strongly connected with necromancy, which makesAzrael a particularly interesting choice. He appears in the form of a boy, a common choice also forskryer or medium, and an important detail in itself. Given the necromantic connection it is particularlyinteresting that the very next chapter is that rarity in the published grimoire genre, an account of anecromantic process:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Nigromancy or Art to Evoke the DeadThis class of divination was practiced with great fervour by the Ancient Greeks, who receivedoracles, that is to say, true answers about the future. Magicians presided over these practiceswho demanded that the sacrifices were made to the deceased, in order to make them propitious,without which they remained deaf to the questions that were asked them.Saul, having consulted a necromancer, was shown the shade of Samuel, who predicted thosethings destined for him. Basil, Emperor of Constantinople, having lost to Constantine the sonwhom he loved, consecrated himself to the practice of Nigromancy and with the advice of aheretical monk called Santabrenus was able to make appear a phantom that bore great similarityto his son. In Salamanca and Toledo, in past centuries, there existed schools of Nigromancy indeep caverns, which many of the wise attended. In order to evoke the dead place the ring ofSolomon on the middle finger of your right hand, and after exalting your spirit to God, place yourhand upon the heart of the corpse and say: I conjure you, creature that you were and no longerare, by the spirits whose names are engraven on this magical and magnetized ring, that youattend my call and answer the questions that I will ask.A second and third time I conjure you that your lips formulate the answers to that which Iask to you, by the wonderful power of this sacred ring, identical to the one which Solomonowned during his life. Having your hand on its heart, you will ask him, and if you are worthyand virtuous he will obey your request.Of interest in this section is the mention of the caverns of Toledo and Salamanca. The latter wasencountered earlier when discussing Asmodeus, in connection with Four Queens of demons. In factboth cities were famed for their legendary occult colleges, and the cavern of Salamanca is interestingin several respects. The cave there was said to have been fashioned by Hercules, and the magicalcollege there was instructed by the Devil in person, often in the form of a goat. Intriguingly a churchdedicated to Saint Cyprian was constructed over it, demolished in the 16th century. The cave isprimarily associated with Saint Cyprian, occasionally bearing his name. So too Sir Walter Scottassociated it with Michael Scot, who: When in Salamanca’s cave Him listed his magic wand to wave The bells would ring in Notre Dame.Stephen Skinner, in his Terrestrial Astrology, mentions that Ramon Lull persuaded the Pope toestablish chairs in Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean and Arabic at Salamanca University among others. Thismay well have contributed to the reputation of the cavern, as learning in Greek and Arabic was muchaccelerated thereby, and with it the distribution of magical lore, real and legendary alike. So it is thatthree legendary male adepts are associated with the cave. Such caverns are often associated with theSibyl in folklore elsewhere in Europe, although regarding this one I have been unable to trace such alegend in Iberian folklore. However, Felix de Castro informs me that: in South America the wordSalamanca means a cave in which is practiced magic. So too, the Jewish legend connecting the citywith a Queen of demons is highly suggestive. Maria Padilha of course would be a highly appropriateSibyl to preside over such a Salamanca."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A brief section follows, introducing another book."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Invocations, Pacts and Exorcisms... the one that attempts to put into practice the experiments that follow, needs to be cleansed ofsin and must put all his faith and will into the ceremonies and conjurations. He should befearless in the extreme, without letting himself be shaken when malevolent spirits attempt tomake him abandon his enterprise. The one with faith and fearlessness will achieve mastery inprodigious things, whilst he who is afraid and diminished of spirit is exposed to torment andharm, without securing any benefit.This declaration made, which serves as a prologue; I will explain the different classes ofsupernatural beings necessary to practice the points of the work.The third book then follows in several parts. Chapters 1 to 4 can be dealt with in concise terms. Theopening chapter is ‘Of the spirits generally.’ The first named is the supreme or creator spirit, or God.In this the book is at one with both common religious convictions and the grimoires. All things aresubject to the Creator, including all beings the magician is to conjure. Cyprian reminds us more thanonce in this section that the spirits concerned are celestial, elemental and infernal. In contradiction toearlier parts of the text this section enjoins us to make use of the sign of the Cross, which cannot berefused by evil spirits, and is venerated by the higher types. Chapter 2, ‘Of the hierarchy of spirits,’reiterates the primacy of the supreme spirit, and indulges in a lengthy tangent concerning travellingthrough endless space without reaching the limits of his domain. It then moves on to the superiorspirits.Superior spirits are first in this category and therefore have the power to command the othersthat are inferior. First of all is Adonay, called the Angel of Light, who directly receives fromthe Supreme Being the orders which are given to the others. In his immediate service and withidentical powers, there are two others, whose names are Eloin and Jehovam ...The names of Adonay, Eloim and Jehovah are the chief names of power employed in the GrandGrimoire. Here they are personified as individual divine or angelic powers, which practice is farfrom lacking in precedent (PGM III.146–54). Essentially the Names of God are themselves entitiesand potencies, and here the text is consistent with what has been said above concerning the names inthe prayer for success as independent beings:... they have the task of complying to the mandates that Adonay receives and that they thentransmit to the spirits in charge of their execution. Immediately following them in the hierarchyare Mitraton, Azrael, Astroschio, Eloy, Milech, Ariel and Zenaoth.Of this list several have an established significance already. Mitraton is invoked in the processes ofthe True Grimoire, to be precise among the most pure angels invoked in the Orison of theInstruments. Azrael was encountered above in the context of the Mirror of Solomon. Astroschio is avariant of a name from the prayer for success in the True Grimoire. Ariel, supposedly a composite ofUriel and Anael, is also invoked in the Grand Grimoire.... each has at his command many other spirits who render absolute obedience to them.

The major one is thegreat Adonay, or the Angel of Light, as he is known. Next we will give a general idea of thecelestial spirits that can be said to form true armies, as much by their organization, as by theobedience wherewith they execute the orders received from their superiors.The chapter that follows this promise enumerates the names and powers of the Olympic spirits of theArbatel Magia Veterum. The name Arbatel, the careful reader will recall, was earlier added to theprayer for success as it appears in the True Grimoire and elsewhere. Each of these indeed dispensesmany legions of followers and may be considered as forming celestial armies, as above. It ends byintroducing the next subject. In addition the reverence for the very name of Arbatel throughout marksthe author’s thought as influenced by Paracelsus, from whose school it originates."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CTHE GNOMESHAPTERS FIVE & SIX of the third book are truly remarkable, as may be seen from the extendedquotes below. I have also moved a related part of the book to be considered alongside thesepassages. What first attracted me to them was the use of a Spanish term gnomo. This word ofthe Cyprian text also appeared in passages of Antonio de Alva’s O Livro dos Exus and Frisvold’sKiumbanda. Gnomo is a title associated with Exu Calunga (corresponding to the GV’s Duke Syrach).Here is what de Alva has to say:Given the ignorance that, in general, people have regarding the reality of the Exus, many judgethat, one (Exu Calunga or Syrach) is three:1 · Exu Calunga or Syrach2 · Exu Gnomo3 · Exu CalunguinhaThe truth, however, should be emphasised, which is that these are one unique Exu; to beprecise, the Exu Calunga. The representation of him – made like a true dwarf – appears to bedue to misinterpretation by less informed individuals; concerning the so-called Duendes[Goblins], Calungas, Gnomes, Calunguinhas, Sacis [one legged but speedy Brazilian foresttricksters, generally black] etc.There is too much ground to cover to comment on this straight away; here begins instead the firstCyprianic text relating to the gnomes:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"NThe gnomesOW CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE of the types of spirits; detailing the elements theyinhabit, the properties and functions with which they are entrusted, according to theinnate instincts or will of the King of Hosts. We supplicate Him for their cooperation inour magical undertakings. We are going to now deal with other spiritual beings distinct in everyway from these. They form a different legion and they work and act with absolute freedom inrelation to the others.The designation of these spirits is gnomes. In the annals of magic Arbatel defines them asfollows:The spirit guardians of treasures, friends of humanity, of which they comprise an integralpart, are invulnerable to our subtler enchantments.This statement, written by great Arbatel, has been badly interpreted in one of its moresignificant parts. This is because in the overall science of the genii they are such a non-uniformtype. Such are the principles of the versicle indicated above, from the Red Book, themasterpiece of Arbatel. This work is in Arabic from which I take the translation. The secrets ofthese arcana are not available without speaking a conjuration to take control of the original rarebook, written on parchment. Olympiadorus and Sinesius tried in vain to copy it, for as theywrote the characters were erased. Nevertheless, such was their desire to know it, that theywere able to retain in the memory some paragraphs. These were very useful to them inexperiments of alchemy, to make artificially gold and diamonds ...At face value the name Arbatel suggests the grimoire of the same name. Arbatel does containreferences to elemental spirits and to treasure. In the former as in much else it plainly followsParacelsus. A useful account of these influences can be obtained from the enlightening introduction toPeterson’s edition. The quotation however does not appear; the implied reference is to Paracelsianmagic and its sources. For our purposes Olympiadorus (6th century CE) and Synesius (4th century CE)may be defined briefly. They were Alexandrian Neoplatonists; both are associated with an interest inalchemy, Hermes Trismigestus and the Chaldean Oracles. The implied role of spirits in suchprocesses is also thoroughly Paracelsian.... Leaving these digressions aside, we will say that the qualification of guardians of treasuresalluded to is hyperbolic, this meaning is but apparent. The author speaks not only of hiddentreasures in the form of minerals, precious stones, coined currency, etc., but also thoseconcealed in the mind of man. For understand well, a greater wealth than we mortals usuallypossess is faithfully guarded by them. The way of supreme perfection is to gain submission byfree will of these spirits to the matter.The case is that our spirit is constituted in such a way, that into it enter an immensity of smallspirits. These work constantly in the development of our ideas and in direct relation with thegnomes are produced in our soul sensations of pleasure, joy, value, love, affection, fear, sadness"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"and many others. Without exact knowledge of their origin, these seize of us absolutely. Thesespirits are so tiny that to make any comparison, we would have to say that they resemble atoms...A more modern author may well have compared them to sub-atomic particles, which move andpenetrate. However, more apropos of our subject and what is to follow in the third part of thissection, is the following from the Hermetica:Cosmos itself is full ... with bodies, diverse in quality and form, possessing each its properkind and size. And of these bodies one is greater or less than another, by difference of strengthand size. Of course, the stronger of them are more easily perceived, just as the larger. Thelesser ones, however, or the more minute, can scarcely be perceived, or not at all ... whencemany ... think they are not bodies, and that there are void spaces, which is impossible. This[Sensible] Cosmos ... is fully filled with bodies and living beings ... the proper shape ofwhich we do not all behold, but [see] some large beyond their proper measure, some verysmall; either because of the great space which lies between [them and ourselves], or elsebecause our sight is dull; so that they seem to us to be minute, or by the multitude are thought notto exist at all, because of their too great tenuousness. I mean the daimons – who, I believe, havetheir abode with us – and heroes, who abide between the purest part of air above us and theearth; where it is ever cloudless, and there is no stirring from the Signs.Asclepius 33Here plainly there is a conception of spirits who are or seem to be of minute size. These includedaimons, who are ‘with us’ – as in the medico-magic of the decans – and the heroes dwelling in thehigher atmosphere, whose role is crucial to Theurgic eschatology; in short, aerial rather thanterrestrial spirits.The conception of these spirits in our text illustrates the experimental Hermeticism of Paracelsianmagic influencing the later grimoires. That collectors of grimoire manuscripts were influenced by thisthinking is clear from the Landowne 1202 Key. The same line passes through the Comte de Gabalis tothe Bibliothèque Bleue.... There exists no obstacle to their motion, in the fulfilment of their work. As soon as we appearon the face of this orb and inhale the first breath of life, we are victims of their beneficialinvasion. They accompany and direct us towards the destiny that Providence indicated to us inadvance.So complex, ample and important is that which they perform in our lives, we can almost saythat we depend upon them. We write this without regret, for the natural reason that we have tounderstand the gnomes to explain many phenomena that happen to us which until now havelacked clear explanation.The residence of the gnomes is the airwaves, and they, like their dwellings, are never at rest.In addition they have the property to penetrate all the pores of the Earth and filter into the heartof mountains. They have absolute power over the imagination of man, being his guide in alldangers, his inspiration when in doubt, and his horoscope for the future. From them, nearlyalways, come those preoccupations particular to us.They are the transmitting zephyr of the orders, demands or requests of men to the spirits and of"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"these to each other. Thus convictions come of good and bad things, even to the detriment ofrational beings. Their voice drags them to their destiny, trying to rid themselves of their burden,striking the obstacles that are found to their steps. Ruin comes in this way to the power of othertypes of spirits. For nothing can resist their just impulses; as previously stated, the gnomes have,as their main mission, to guard against and balance the threat of malignant spirits.Also we have made clear that the influence or action of the gnomes is exerted upon the brain.Therefore, they are engenderers of the illusion of the senses. They love man and they provide animmaterial life to him, they make him dream and they teach him to feel. It is not true that thedream is no more than a repetition of thoughts already imprinted on our encephalic mass. No, bythese same gnomes the imagination is incessantly urged to work. It is able to create at anymoment. If it lacked these mechanics, it would be confused until the moment it arrived at thegreat transformation, which would not be distant. Different degrees of mental activity and restcan only exist in relation to these ‘cells’ that vibrate in our understanding ...These spirits – able to penetrate physical bodies – form part of the understanding of life and magic;for Hermetic and Paracelsian magicians alike. Cyprian’s use of the term gnome in this context isdistinct from but parallel to the elemental earth spirit. The minuteness is not necessarily literal, butspeaks of their ability to enter any body: animal, vegetable or mineral. Cyprian chooses to emphasisetheir penetration – and motion – within our mental or spiritual being. The elevation caused by theirentering thence is part of the magician’s initiation, a fact the Swiss magician-doctor understood verywell. He describes the beneficial effects of conjunctions of Olympic spirits occurring within peoplelike those of the planets outside them; Peterson in his introduction to Arbatel writes: the Olympicspirits ... are the stars in people. Our present text enlarges upon this benign influence:Nothing is as beautiful as to surrender to these spirits when they provide us with platonicpleasures. We do not enjoy the soul in unison, unless it is purified and learns to contemplatedivine or supernatural things, when transported by these graceful spirits on wings of desire tounknown regions. They cause us to experience a thousand sensations that surprise us, bringingforth in our mind vague ideas and outlines of a yearned for happiness, which we can then beginto obtain for ourselves.We enjoy an ecstasy more and more embellished, elevating us to the resplendent Sun of Truth,which shines in the immense space of the supreme Good. Angels of misfortune fight to stop theirprogress, although in obedience to the laws of nature they cannot destroy it. Through theirfacility we detect the interference of these spirits with our aims, since they are intimately boundto them. Thus it is that if we commit harm, after the inner hesitation, we have remorse; and if theresult is good then indescribable joy and satisfaction inhabits the manifest soul throughrealisation of their work. How else can we explain that joy or grief sui generis which wesometimes have, which without visible cause awakens in us? It is through the gnomes causingechoes in our central nervous system. It is they who warn us, either not to begin or to release thebrakes of discouragement. Little by little with sudden impressions they guard against andfamiliarise us to the temptation we are to suffer, in this way making us superior to it.Is it not true that often when we speak of a person we have not seen for a long time, he happensto appear before our eyes brief moments later? Then to what can this be attributed, if not to thegnomes? The uneasiness that assaults us when nearby a stranger watches us; that antipathy oraffection that is born at the first glance between two people, and the good predisposition we"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"have towards the magnanimous stars, what are these but so many examples of the existence ofthese spirits in contact with us?Yes, one hundred times yes; they flow within us; our inseparable companions during the transitthat, shorter than long, we all undergo. We must try to make ourselves deserving of their aid,through reflection upon their actions, taking care that their call is followed by submission to itsinclinations. Thus we will arrive most directly at the sum of the wisdom allotted by the HighOne to his chosen.The following chapter also deals with elemental spirits after a brief preamble.

They areproduced by fits of imagination, the restlessness of men fixated on securing great and rapid fame.All works must be exiled that have such character. Welcome only the renowned ones, which allpeople admit reveal secrets of the infinite. These magical words alone contain wonderful andstrange arcana.Primary among the infinite things man contemplates is Space. Of this one can say that it is theworld of prodigies and mysteries. They take place constantly before us, without them we havenot the slightest idea. Space is populated with an innumerable multitude of beings of sinisterappearance, but in reality these beings are most amenable. They are lovers of our science,subtle, helpful towards ingenious or wise men, enemies of stupid and ignorant ones.The beings of this class who colonise the air are called sylphs; those that populate the seas andrivers undines. Those which populate the Earth and its interior are called, gnomes. They are theguardians of metals and stones. The gnomes, as I have said, have virtue in the highest degree,being propitious to wise and ingenious men. They provide to those possessing these qualities,the treasures of stones and metals; without seeking any reward other than the satisfaction ofbeing helpful.In the burning core of the Earth is the region of fire, there the salamanders, propitious tophilosophers, live.Another class of invisible beings exist called genii familiares. Socrates, Pythagoras, Plato,Celsus, Zoroaster and many other luminaries of the highest spheres of philosophy – dominatingevery branch of human knowledge – had a genius familiaris possessed of excellent wisdom.

Nevertheless they positivelyinfluence all judgments a man forms, though they are less effective and active in influencing afool than the wise.Besides these types, I could enumerate others, such as the duendes and trasgos. These dedicatethemselves to bothering men with blows, noises and many other manifestations that inform us oftheir existence.The duendes belong to Iberian folklore; they resemble goblins and will be encountered again later.Trasgos originate in the same traditions.The following section concerning the gnomes mentioned above is from a later portion of the text. Itake it out of sequence for convenience in understanding these entities.Invocation to the gnomes so that they are propitious"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The gnomes play a very important role in all invocations. These spirits transmit our petitions tothose to whom we direct them. Due to the nature of their intelligence, manifestations can result inharm to our minds, or disturb our senses; they could surprise us and cause death by fright. Or ifwe are indiscreet about wonderful or celestial manifestations we have witnessed, whenmentioning the event we could give people the impression that we are crazy, ignorant orpossessed. This surely would make us lose the esteem of many people who would form aprejudicial opinion. For these and other causes hidden from our sight, sometimes they do notshow themselves inclined to help in our enterprises, making it extremely difficult to achieve ourdesires.In order to obtain their beneficial influence it is advisable for us, before the invocation ofspirits whose appearance or aid we solicit, to appeal to the gnomes for assistance, reciting byheart the following oration:Oh, admirable and incomprehensible genies! With blind faith and humble heart, I throwmyself upon your mercy. My hope is that – as you direct my steps and actions from themoment I appeared upon this planet until that one in which, my mission completed, youcollect my spirit to accompany it to sidereal worlds, to the place that the Supreme Creatorhas reserved to us in his inscrutable aims – so equally will you lend your aid in transmittingfaithfully my requests to the celestial (or infernal) spirits, without varying the conception ofmy words or intentions. Look favourably on the purity of my feelings; my great desire andconfidence, my discretion and reserve; you appreciate all the qualities that I have andrepair in me those defects until now not rejected, nor do you make cause to withhold yourcooperation from me, but work constantly in perfecting me from all impurity to make meworthy of the gifts that Divinity grants its chosen ones, and to give thanks with all my soulduring the time of my peregrination on this planet, for the favour that I receive from you.Amen."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSLiturgical Transplants and MagicY APPROACH, throughout this Encyclopædia, is essentially ecumenical or open-ended. It isnot my role to tell people what theology or cultural background to prefer. Description of theevolution of Western magic from the synthesis period, involving Jewish, pagan andChristian expressions, involves commonalities that require appreciation. For the first time inthousands of years another synthesis period is emerging from the meeting of Western and Africantraditions – among others – in a newly globalised world. Commonalities provide options forsynthesis, for mutual understanding, for adaptation in various ways. Many of these options I leave forthe reader, or larger movements, to explore in their own way.The approach employed in these two particular volumes provides a profound non-denominationalmodel, whereby ritual processes within Western magic can be compared. This regardless of whethera Supreme Deity concept is superimposed on the archaic practical agencies, or indeed whichSupreme Deity is preferred if so. So too the names of the practical agencies, and their culturalorigins, are in large part left open; once one understands that these names indicate positions and roles,one may proceed to structure or restructure rituals on that basis.All this places considerable responsibility with the reader, but also circumvents the limitationsimplicit had I approached the project differently; saying ‘these are my gods, these are my spiritsuperiors and spirits, work my system by rote and you won’t have to think very hard.’ That approachhas been employed extensively and has not provided much by way of insight; reinforcing differencesrather than revealing underlying patterns and their syncretic basis. If anything misunderstandings andartificial elements have proliferated by this means. Invention without attention to the underlyingprinciples has had many failings. The need for the kind of analysis I have undertaken is reinforcedrather than lessened in consequence.However, I have anticipated some, indeed many, of the difficulties readers will face. Evolving alocal or personal synthesis – with its preferences and theology in place – with organising principlesbased on the more universal model, is facilitated in various ways.For example, the selection of the Grimorium Verum as the operating system serves severalpurposes.• Hierarchical: The chiefs, their deputies and subordinates are the best organised examplewithin the genre. The central advantage of an intermediary spirit within the operating system isan additional and conceptually essential plus. Once the role of the Four Kings is reintegrated,goetic ritual on the grimoire model as a whole can be explored in a coherent form for the firsttime in the Occult revival.• Syncretic: The parallels with Kimbanda – while not overlooking cultural distinctions –provide insight into the relations of goetia and New World traditions. The parallels withancient Underworld trinities and the workings of the PGM etc. provide additional routesforward."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"• Similarly the reader is not obliged to abandon modern rituals in favour of exclusivelytraditional modes. The organising structures of Verum and of Pyramidos are compatible; thetiming of the prayer for success coincides with the Thelemic Adorations of the Sun(supplementary rather than either/or), and so on.My recommendation of Pyramidos as the frame ritual for a modern liturgical transplant also takesaccount of several factors. In particular any readers interested in the papyri, in Paganism, in Thelemaor in ancient syncretic magic should be aware of the phenomenal utility of making this ritual the basisof their work with the grimoire. There are several reasons for this, some of which will becomeclearer through use. In the meantime a brief outline of the reasons will assist the reader in making thetransition.Verum has a very marked trinitarian structure. The book itself is written in three parts. In itshierarchy there are three chiefs of the spirits, each with two deputies who each have threesubordinates. In the original text conjurations by Father, Son and Holy Ghost are frequent – chthonicsubstitutions have been discussed in this volume. In addition the design of the magical circle consistsof a double ring containing a triangle, and so on. The structure of Pyramidos is similarly triadic. It isa fairly simple matter to correlate the three deities which principally preside over Pyramidos withthe chiefs of the Verum system; each deity having authority over the chiefs, their deputies and theirsubordinates.Principal syncretic deityHermes-ChthoniosHadesor Dis PaterHecateor ArtemisPyramidos deityTahutiHoor-Apep(Set-Horus)Asi(Isis)Verum ChiefLuciferBelzebuthAstarothPyramid directionEastNorth-WestSouth-West Goetic work, which of course is what Verum is all about, involves religious ritual, and always hasdone, long before either Christianity or the grimoires. This background makes a confession part andparcel of the procedure of goetic magic; Pyramidos contains a confession. Some of the formulæ inVerum require a Mass to be said; Pyramidos contains a Mass. The presence in the ritual of aconfession and a Mass enables these important elements to be retained outside Catholic theology.Both are required in the context of goetic ritual, and have deep roots in Dionysian rites. Thedifference between natural religion and later revealed religion has been addressed previously in thisrespect. It does not obviate these requirements, but deeply concerns both archaic and resurgentaspects of Goetia.In addition Pyramidos contains a very useful opening and closing ceremony which can frame ritualsof evocation. All in all Pyramidos is capable of seamless assimilation to the practice of goetic magicon the Verum model. The triadic structure of the ritual; the incorporation of dance orcircumambulation in place of theologically slanted or spirit-phobic banishing processes; the readilymemorised and potent employment of rhyme, are powerful arguments in its favour.The facility with which Israfel – the Invocation of Thoth – is readily incorporated between theopening and closing provides a model for the use of divine invocation as an alternative to grimoire"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"based processes.

This material is essentially alreadycollated in the True Grimoire; give or take a detail here or there. Lucifer, Emperor; Belzebuth,Prince; Astaroth, Great Duke are the chief spirits of the infernal kingdom. Their deputies areLucífuge, prime minister; Satanachia, great general; Agaliarept, great general; Fleurety, lieutenantgeneral; Sargatanas, brigadier and Nebiros, field marshal.A slight deviation from the GG format occurs in placing three special emissaries at the disposal ofthese deputies, to transmit their orders: Mirion, Belial and Anagaton. This may reflect the influence ofthe GV apparent elsewhere in the grimoire, the messengers representing a diminished substitute forScirlin. Only Belial appears to have any previous history.

This is the major difficulty in resolving TG and GG hierarchies into acommon system. This could be resolved in various ways, but note that GG conjurations call"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"upon all three Chiefs when conjuring a Deputy, thus reducing the need for changes, especiallysince the subordinates are not the same as in GV.It is a curious fact that the Grand Grimoire has been often supposed a not especially seriousgrimoire. Its nature has been thought sensationalist, or some kind of imposture at the expense of thereader. At the same time a quite artificial reputation has accrued to the Goetia of Solomon. Virtuallyever since Crowley pirated Mathers’ transcription and editing of it, the latter has been accorded thestatus of some kind of über-grimoire.It is interesting then to compare them in terms of a principal part of goetic grimoires, their accountof their hierarchy and its role in ritual procedure. Certainly in both cases the origin of the main bodyof spirits has been from Weyer’s Pseudomonarchia. There however the resemblance ends: the GrandGrimoire gives a full account of its operative hierarchy, the Superiors, their Deputies and thesubordinates. It gives sigils for both the first two categories, along with powers associated with theSubordinates (the Chiefs are not working spirits; their role is the granting of authority). For thesubordinates it gives no sigils, and no account of their powers; in context they are simply theexecutors of powers associated with their leader. From this we can deduce fairly logically that theemployment of sigils is associated with the forming of pacts with Chiefs and Deputies, and that thebenefits associated with this arrangement are administered by proxy. The magician does not requirethe sigils of the subordinates, since they act under the authority of superior spirits with whom he hasan arrangement.The Goetia of Solomon by contrast gives sigils and powers for the seventy two spirits who form itscatalogue, all apparently considered subordinates. These, so we are informed, are under the rule ofFour Kings of the cardinal points. Also by extension, as can be readily extrapolated from externalsources, the four elements. The role of the Kings is said to be essential to the process. Judging fromthe role of such leaders in the Grand Grimoire – in other grimoires, and also the appeals to the godsof the Underworld in the papyri – this is a justifiable assertion. However, there is no accountwhatever of them, nor of who rules whom, nor of any sigils, nor a description of their powers.This is a remarkable omission, especially given the regard it is held in amongst aficionados of thegenre. We need hardly add that the Four Kings, whose description is so inadequate, were likelyoriginally envisaged as deputies of superior spirits of whom no account is given at all. By contrast, toconclude, the operating system of the Grand Grimoire is both more coherent and complete. Itsprocedure is clear and comprehensive; the relations between the ranks of its operative spirits areclearly delineated without omissions."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"TTHE SUPERIORSAND SPELL WORKHE FOLLOWING MATERIAL is excerpted from the section of the grimoire entitled ‘Chaldean andEgyptian Magic: Philtres, Enchantments, Witchcraft and Sorceries.’ I do not advocate the literaluse of any formula involving cruelty to animals. On the contrary, the particular creaturesemployed should be regarded as totem animals for this style of magic. The resemblance of the frog ortoad to a human being underlies many of the spells herein. This may encourage some experimentationwith variations on poppet spells. The humanoid quality this symbolism bestows upon the toad is alsoa clue to the implicit totemic attribution of the three creatures; toad, most human, to Lucifer (GVstresses non-monstrous appearance as a human child); cat, lunar, to Astaroth (Artemisia); bat, wingedand nocturnal, to Belzebuth. As will be seen, this trinity is directly invoked in several of the spellsinvolving these creatures. Following the link between mansions and spirits in animal form, thesecreatures may be read as heraldic symbols for employment in magical images; whether as godforms,spirit shapes, engraved or drawn on talismans, or made from wax or clay and so forth.It is a given by now that the three superiors of the Grand Grimoire hierarchy and those of the GVare Lucifer, Belzebuth and Astaroth; the Emperor, Prince and Grand Duke. So too there are groundsfor invoking the Four Kings in ceremonial spell-workings; gaining the implicit assistance of theirsubordinates. The Book of Saint Cyprian gives numerous examples of spell working – of a much lessceremonial nature – in which the unholy trinity is invoked. This does not begin with the GV cycle;firstly, the structure and content of some of the spells have linear descent from the papyri. Morespecifically, the invoking in spells of these three names has a Byzantine precedent: a love spell,wherein a magical image is wrought and marked with the name of the target and their mother (the useof the latter is common in the papyri). The names of Loutzipher, Beelzeboul and Astaroth are writtenon a strip of paper which is inserted in the spine of the doll. At a subsequent point the image issweated over a fire for three successive nights while conjuring these three spirits for assistance.(LDA 267; Delatte’s Anecdota 459–460 from P f146v).Many examples from the Book of Saint Cyprian – employing toads, cats and bats – follow below,but the principle is not restricted to these examples:In order to cause the evil eyeTake the eyes of a male lion and dry them under the light of the moon, when it is in the firstquarter. When they are dried, make an infusion with some peppercorns in a bottle of old whitewine. Leave undisturbed until the moon returns to the first quarter. Once the infusion is ready,filter the wine through a fine clean cloth, and add a spoonful of honey. Then you will remainlocked in a dark room for twenty-four hours. At the end of which, you will drink a small glass ofthe concoction, elevating your spirit and pronouncing these words: Lucifer, Belzebuth, Astaroth;turn your infernal power against N, Amen.Next seek out the one you wish harm, with eyes lowered so as not to see people you wish noharm upon.

Amen."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"It is proven that, when this experiment is performed in the form described, the person againstwhom you have directed it will immediately suffer the effects of your curse.Here the ruling triad, Lucifer, Belzebuth and Astaroth are invoked as an Infernal Trinity. This L:B:Aformula is a counterpart of the Lucifer, Belzebuth, Satan formula found elsewhere and referred to asL:B:S; my preference is for the former.There are similarities, but also differences, when comparing the spells worked invoking threesuperiors to those invoking four kings. How high or low the degree of ceremony observed happens tobe does not appear to be an arbiter between them, although overly select literary examples mightsuggest otherwise. Rather the key difference is at what point in ritual they occur; the Four Kings wheninvoked are called before the spell is worked, whereas the three superiors are invoked during spellwork.There is a difference too in terms of status; invoking the four could open for a spell worked with thesuperiors, the opposite would be redundant. Incidentally, in the GV many actions are performed in thename of the Holy Trinity; hermeneutically – as in Kimbanda – interchangeable with the InfernalTrinity.ENCHANTMENTS PRODUCED BY THE VIRTUES & QUALITIES OF TOADSThese kinds of spells are very easy to perform, according to Saint Cyprian they have thegreatest power of all. In his book The Legend of the Magician he tells us that the toad has agreat and invincible magical power, for it has a pact with Lucifer, ever since it became the foodwhich Lucifer gives to souls in hell. Thus the spells and charms of the toad are an ongoingenactment issuing from this pact.Spells of the toad with the sewn eyesChoose a large toad, male if the spell is for a man, female if for a woman. Once you have itcaught it, hold it in your right hand and pass it below your belly five times saying, mentally, thefollowing words: Toad, little toad, as I pass you below my belly, thus N does not have peacenor rest, while they do not come here, in their whole heart and body, soul and life.These words being said, take a very fine needle threaded with green silk. Sew the eyelids ofthe toad closed; taking care not to hurt the eyes, because otherwise the person you wish toenchant will be blinded. Stay close to the edge of the eyelids, in order that the toad’s eyes areconcealed, but without having suffered damage.These words are then spoken to the toad with the sewn eyes: Toad: by the power of Lucifer,the prince of Belzebuth, I sewed your eyes, thus make N so that in the whole world whilewithout my company they do not have peace nor rest as long as they do not come to me, andwalk blind to all other women (or men, according to the sex of the person who you enchant).Loving and thinking of me only.

I will not release you here; here you are captive,imprisoned just as this toad is."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The pot or container in which the toad is placed has to contain a little water, which will bechanged every day.Note the invoking of Lucifer and Belzebuth in the above spell, paralleled below.

Remove the toad from the pot, unsew the mouth and give him cow’s milk todrink for five days. When removing him from the pot, the following words must be spoken: Bythe power of Lucifer, Belzebuth, of Astaroth and all the infernal spirits, my will is endedwith the spell that weighed on N so let them recover their health by means of my desires, asthis toad is going to recover it by the means of my care.As in the previous spell, the sex of the toad will have to be the same as that of the personagainst whom it is performed.Note the invocation in this spell of the ruling triad (of both True and Grand grimoires); plainly this isin their role as chiefs of the lesser spirits.Witchcraft of the toad to create love against the will of a person and to secure marriageWhen one enamoured wishes to marry the object of their desire as quickly as possible, but heremains cold or obstinate and does not want the marriage or union: it can be hastened and changecaused in him, first in thoughts and later in feelings, in the following way:Take an object belonging to the desired one and tie it against the belly of the toad, next the feetof the toad are tied with a red ribbon. Place the toad in a pot or earthenware jar with a littlecow’s milk. Having done this, the following words are spoken, having taken good care to placeyour lips over the mouth of the pot: N (the name of the person desired) as I have thus imprisonedthis toad within this pot, which does not see the sun nor the moon, thus you will see no woman,neither married nor unmarried, nor widow. You will only direct your thoughts toward me; andas this toad has bound legs, therefore I imprison yours and you cannot move them but towardsmy house; and just as this toad lives within this pot, starving and tortured, thus you will livewhile you do not marry or unite with me.These words said the pot is sealed so that the toad does not see the light of day; later, when youhave secured your desire, you release the toad, remove the object that you tied around its belly,without causing it harm, and care for him well, understanding that otherwise the target would"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"undergo the same privations as the toad.

Then taking the mainfibre of the wool, suspend it in a chimney so that the toad’s belly faces upwards. At midnightcall the Devil (Lucifer) with each tolling of the clock, and then turn over the toad, uttering thefollowing words: Impure tiny creature, by the power of the devil, to whom I sold my bodyand not my soul, I command you: do not permit one shade of happiness on the Earth beenjoyed by N. As I placed its health within the mouth of this toad and thus it has to die, thusdies also N who I conjure three times in the name of the devil, the devil, the devil. Thefollowing morning, put the toad into a clay pot and seal it hermetically. In order to undo theeffects of this spell, supposing that the person would suffer too much as a result of it, removethe toad from the pot, unstitch its mouth and let him drink fresh cow’s milk for seven days.The demonology of this text is clarified by the note in parentheses. Lucifer is the chief, or Devil,rather than Satan.In order to cause a man to dislike his wife or the woman he lives with; or vice versaProcure a fine young toad of the appropriate sex, and sew its eyes closed with black silk. Takecare – as already indicated in the previous instructions – of not hurting the eyes. This operationperformed, proceed in the same manner as previously, replacing the words with the following:Impure tiny creature! In the name of the devil, to whom I sold my body, but not my soul, as Isewed your eyes closed, so let it be with N, so that (she or he) does not like any other personbut me, and is blind to all the other women (or men).Suspend the toad in the chimney of the kitchen for twelve hours, then put him carefully in a claypot which you hermetically seal. The words that you speak, when imprisoning the toad in the pot,are the following: N you are imprisoned here and tied and you will not see the light of the sunnor that of the moon while you do not yet love me in your heart.

Bury it in land near your house, after you have put a beanin each eye, another one underneath the tail and another one in each ear. After this, you coverthe cat with earth and water it every night, that is until the beans have grown and are mature.When this happens, cut them at the base and take them to your house. Place each bean in yourmouth in turn, when you become invisible it is because that bean has the power and thereafteryou can penetrate any place without being seen.When watering the beans: make a fist with your thumb in the palm of the left hand, grasping ittight with the middle finger. Thus you may command the devil that appears to you; this spiritwill thenceforth appear to you unconditionally, and do your bidding. When you go to water thebeans, there will appear to you many ghosts with the purpose of frightening you and preventingyour success. The reason for this is very simple; it does not please the demon to put itself underthe service of anybody, who has not been given to them in body and soul. Be not afraid whenthey appear to you, as they cannot harm you. To assure this, before every action, make the signof the Cross and say a Credo.The following spell is one of those credited to Exu Midnight’s instruction to Cyprian; As the Exuidentified with the GV spirit Hael, he interlinks Kimbanda, Cyprian and the GV hierarchy. IoannisMarathakis has traced the origins of the spell to the technical Hermetica. The invisibility spell of theGV has the same origin.Magic of the black cat’s skullBoil a cauldron of water upon white wood of grapevine and of willow, and when it comes tothe boil place within it a live black cat, letting it cook until the bones separate from the flesh.Having conducted this operation, place all the bones into a cloth. Position yourself in front of amirror, putting them bone by bone into your mouth until your reflection disappears from themirror, revealing that this is the bone which has the virtue to render invisible the person whocarries it in their mouth. When you want to go to some place without being seen you place thebone in your mouth and say: I want to be in (such a place) by the power of black magic.Take note that there is no necessity to insert the entire bone in order to make the test in themirror; it is enough for it to go in a little way past the teeth.Another enchantment by means of black cats"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"When a black cat unites with a cat of the same colour, take a pair of scissors and cut a handfulof hairs from them both.

Tie a black cat (without one whitehair) by the back legs with a hemp rope. To conduct this operation, you take the bound cat to aforest or solitary crossroads, and there say the following: I, N, by authority of the OmnipotentGod, command that the demon appears to me, under pain of disobedience to the rule of thesuperiors. I, by the mighty power of black magic, command you – oh demon – Lucifer orSatan, who I put in the body of N, and also I order you, in the name of that same omnipotentGod, that you do not leave this body before I ordain it and you do everything that my wishconsists of: (one says here what you desire the demon to do). Oh, great Lucifer, emperor ofeverything infernal, I catch you and I stop you and I bind you in the body of N, just as I haveimprisoned and bound this black cat. In order that you do everything so ever I want, I offerthis black cat to you, and I will give it to you when you accomplish my desires.When the demon has carried out its obligation you go to the site at which you made the spelland you say twice consecutively: Lucifer, Lucifer, you have here what you were promised,and then release the cat.How to obtain two devils with the eyes of a black catYou will kill a black cat without a single white or grey hair. After you have removed its eyesput them inside two eggs laid by a black hen, taking care that each eye is placed separately ineach egg. Having done this, set them to work by completely hiding them within horse dung; beaware, it is essential that the dung is and will remain hot during the gestation of the devils. SaintCyprian says, you must go every day to the pile of dung for a month; this is the time that it takesthe devils to be born. In your daily visit to the dung that conceals both eggs, in which the devilswill be gestating, the following words are delivered as an oration:Oh great Lucifer!

Once they are born, place them within apin box, of boxwood or ivory, and feed them on filings of iron or of steel. When you are inpossession of these hell born creatures, you will be able to attain whatever you desire; forexample, if you want money, it will suffice to open the box and say: I want money, and it willappear immediately, but with the single condition that you will not be able to give alms to thepoor, nor pay to have masses said, for this money came from the devil.This spell is particularly interesting in that in involves Maria Padilha, a key figure in Iberian folkloricmagic, and in Kimbanda. Thus this spell invokes a Queen of the grimoires, the Sibyl in her darkerguise.Lucky black catTake a black cat, and every Tuesday, at midnight, rub its back with a little ground salt, recitingthe following oration:Oh Sovereign Planet! You who in this hour rule with your influences over the Moon, you Iconjure by the virtues of this salt and of this black cat, and in the name of God the Creator,that you grant to me every kind of good thing, as much in health, as in peace and wealth.This spell is readily adapted to use with a ceramic figure of a cat, or a statuette of the Egyptian catgoddess Bast. The employment of Tuesday nights and the midnight hour is interesting. A black cat isemployed in a rite of Mars in the Sabean rites of Picatrix.SPELLS BY MEANS OF A BATThe bat has long been one of the animals employed by primitive magicians to enchant people.When you want to employ it do so in the following manner and for the purposes specified.Spells employing bats occur in the magical papyri and elsewhere. Bat blood is employed in thegrimoires, and gives its name to a magical ink employed in Hoodoo and related traditions.In order to be lovedSupposing that a young person or lady wishes to marry a particular person, as quickly aspossible; then you must work in the following way:Provide yourself with a bat and sew up the eyes with a needle and strong thread.

Therefore I conjure you to do that in the unextendable term of eightdays, under pain of appeal to more powerful spells. Lucifer, Belzebuth, Astaroth, confirm mydesire and force N to be subjugated in body and soul to me.When all this is executed and the person is enchanted, they will not have one moment oftemporary rest, not one, for this effect is produced by the spell. If later on you do not want to beunited with the person you enchanted, you must burn the object upon which the spell was cast.Another formula for the same thingKill two bats, male and female, and take their blood, which you then add to spirit of salammoniac. Put all this in a glass bottle of a size that you can keep in your pocket. When youwish to charm a young woman or to enchant a man, it is sufficient to let them smell the contentsof the bottle.Controlling spell with mallow from a cemetery or church vestibuleFind three bunches of mallow, take them away and put them underneath the mattress of the bedin which you sleep, saying every day upon waking: N, as this mallow was picked in acemetery and placed beneath me, thus you will be imprisoned by the power of Lucifer andmagic, and only when the corpses of the cemetery of the church see and find this mallow,that grew by the virtue of their fats, will you have my leave.These words must be repeated forcefully for nine consecutive days, in order to produce thedesired effect."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"TSanctum RegnumThe true way to make pacts with infernal spirits, without suffering any harmHE TRUE SANCTUM REGNUM of the great Clavicle of Solomon has extreme importance, whether toacquire treasures, to obtain possession of a woman you desire, or to discover hidden secrets, orto become invisible, or to travel to any place that is desired, open all locks, in short, to realiseevery class of wonders.

The pact can also be made in a room prepared for the purpose,† or in somechamber of a ruined castle; but it is best on top of a mountain as has been discussed, or at acrossroads next to a river.When the site for the invocation has been chosen, accomplish also the following things. A youngvirgin goat is sacrificed there upon a Friday, its skin placed upon the ground, draw upon the skin withthe lodestone concentric circles and the triangle. In the diagram the circle bears these words:* We should mention also the stone ematille or hæmatite, which names are mentioned in manytreatises of magic.† It is seen in the first part, chapter four, what ceremony one will have to use to begin the initiation.route to the treasure, but this has to be considered to have the following meanings:route to eternity,the infinite,space,the unfamiliar,the time of the hidden thing,of the mysterious thing, etc.So that you may succeed in the drawing of the great cabalistic circle and the pacts, we reveal thissecret next.The talismans will be placed underneath the candlesticks that hold blessed wax candles, placed attheir sides three crowns of verbena, basil or elderflower, picked on Saint John’s Eve; you mayemploy either one of these plants, or all three."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Grand Grimoire specifies two wreaths of vervain, one around each candle, and that is the likelyintention here.

So long as he is very daring and fearless, he can dominate them.When everything is ready, place in front of the triangle a metal pan with some burning coals;on which odoriferous perfumes of incense and laurel will be placed.The Grand Grimoire specifies brandy, camphor and incense to feed the fire. Again however, as withthe wreaths, the substitution here has its merits; laurel being associated with Apollo.In the figure showing the triangle and great cabalistic circle of the pacts, will be seen thepositioning of each object.

The substitution is a valid one, and judging from the note, also consciousand deliberate. Note also the description of the rite as an initiation, compatible with the definition ofroute to the treasure.On this theme, a discussion of which may be found in Geosophia, the following spell from the Italianeditions of the True Grimoire is particularly interesting.For the Discovery of TreasureThesaurum queris? Thesaurum inveniens!* Thus Lucifer answers when you call him; and yourespond: Da mihi aurum et dabo tibi thus et myram, ut fecerunt Magi venientes, ad Christuminfantem in Bethlehem.†"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Then he will respond to you in Latin: Pick up your wand and follow me!Without wasting a moment, exit the circle where you invoked the protection of the great King ofthe Spirits, and armed with the wand answer: With you in life and in death, Amen!Then follow Lucifer, or the spirit that he sends in his place, taking care to walk in his footsteps.Sometimes, to test the courage of the one who walks in the steps of an infernal power, the skywill be filled with lightning and thunderclaps, & the air and earth will be full of commotion.All such cries and din will break off, and a hush will echo through the woods, forests, valleys,paths and deserts where man and the Spirit walk.Turn neither to the right, nor to the left, but keep your eyes straight ahead, observing the shadowwhich goes before you in silence, gigantic and formidable.Eventually the spirit will lead you to the entrance of the place where mighty Pluto confineshis treasures in the bowels of the earth; beneath the iron gates of the great Vulcan.* Do you seek treasure? Treasure you shall find!† Give me gold, & I will give you frankincense and myrrh, just as the Magi did whenvisiting the Christ child in Bethlehem. A large black dog, with a magnificent gold collar, will prevent you from entering, and will gnash histeeth, sending sparks blazing like diamonds in sunlight. This is a gnome, at whom you must point thewand, repeating three times: Cerberus, Cerberus, Cerberus! By this wand, show me the way to thetreasure.The dog will whine three times in reply, and will wrap its tail around your wand, to indicate wherethe treasure lies.Walking in his footsteps, you will near the treasure, where the shade of a dead person will bewaiting, namely, the person who hid the treasure, and he will want to fling himself upon you. Swiftlytrace a circle with the wand and throw a coin, shouting to the shade: Hitherto you shall come, andshall go no further!

The context is evidently a rite"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"similar to that in the Grand Grimoire and the reconstruction in the Book of Cyprian. An invocation ofLucifer and a circle with provision for going forth to the treasure are both understood. So too thewand is emphasised, central to proceedings; the wand of the Grand Grimoire or a close relative isimplicit.The King of the Spirits is also a common theme from the late grimoires, although the earlierpantheistic gods of the papyri are not dissimilar. In the context of both the True and Grand grimoireshis likeliest name is Adonay; the ‘Royal Word’ of the Invocation (see True Grimoire 73). Whetherthis name was precisely associated with the God of the Cabalists is less certain than may be assumed;here it is difficult not to imagine it is synonymous with great Lucifer.Apparent stock figures of a thoroughly Classical Underworld surround the penultimate scene of themagical drama. Firstly Pluto, aka Hades, is the King of this realm. His gates are the product ofVulcan’s forge, but this is more than a mythic flourish in an otherwise concise text. This is the Lord ofFire, a central figure of ancient Goetia and the Mysteries most closely associated with it (such asthose of Lemnos and Samothrace). Cerberus, whose name interestingly has no Latin equivalent, isalso a key figure. A chapter was devoted to him in Geosophia, relating his various magicalassociations. Nor should we forget his classic intermediary role in the proto-typical skrying ritualsunderlying the Enochian system, Trithemius and many another. All derive from the necromantic rootsof later rituals where the underworld context is less emphasised, even forgotten.That it is Cerberus who guides the magician on the last stage of his journey is therefore doublysignificant. We may only imagine what added power the wand gains from his touch. Twice we aretold that the dog god is of the race of gnomes, a term fraught with meaning in the genre underexploration. So too we are told that here he acts in a protective role, underlining his psychopompstatus.The encounter with a dead man seems entirely natural in a treasure hunt, but to what atavistic instinctis owed our ready acquiescence? It is the instinctive association of the treasure hunt with themesembodied in necromantic traditions and ancient Mystery cults, unspoken but unforgotten.Now, in matters of the diabolical, there is the matter of the Underworld, or even Hell. So in agrimoire, demons represent an eschatological motif.Why God allows demons to torment His creatures1 So that man obstinate in his faults serves as a terror and example to other men.2 So that those that are not absolutely bad receive punishment in this world for the faults theycommit.3 So that the person who is not punished by demons strives to recognize God and to humblethemselves to him.4 So that there is punishment of minor offences to make amends.5 So that men correct themselves, seeing the truth of divine justice.6 So that the great power of God can be appreciated."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"7 In order to show the great sanctity of some creatures.8 In order to increase merits of the vitiated creatures, returning them to the path ofrighteousness. 9 In order to be further purified in all the senses.10 So that His creatures have purgation in this world and are corrected from error, by seeing somuch evil they can leave behind much good.Clearly (2) implies that those who are absolutely bad are punished and purged further in the life tocome. The whole world system assumed here, including or even particularly the afterlife componentis predicated on the conception of purgation through suffering or striving. The activity of demons ispart of this, implying they are also subject to it. Relations between magicians and spiritual beings arestructured on similar and related principles.The existence of penance, even a form of original sin, in Orphism (an expression of the more primalDionysian cult) was mentioned in Geosophia. Essentially the same can be said of Neoplatonism andTheurgy etc. So too the importance of the Confession or ritualised penance in magical ceremonies isrecognised even in the libertine Crowley’s Magick, let alone the grimoires. A pervading anduniversal myth of purgation – or purification – in back of the goetic experience in all its forms, isimplied. Whether through a psychological, emotional or ontological basis notwithstanding; omissionvitiates the process."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"IMAGIC AS PRACTICAL ESCHATOLOGYTheurgists fall not so as to be ranked among the herd that are in subjection to Fate.Chaldean Oracles, 185T IS AS WELL, considering the importance of the theme, to have a working definition ofeschatology. The common understanding of the term is the branch of theology concerned withlast things such as death and the Last Judgment; Heaven and Hell, reward and punishment.Unfortunately the association with the Last Judgment – a collective future event real or imagined – haslargely overshadowed the other primary use, namely death and the afterlife on an individual level.The collective sense, particularly Christian symbolism surrounding the Apocalypse, is often what isunderstood by the term; to the exclusion of other matters. Meanwhile in mysticism the phrase refers tothe end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine. For our purposes the individual and mysticalsenses, separate from any conception of the End of History, are primary. Such allied topics as rewardand punishment, associated with death and the afterlife, remain part of the subject.This distinction is important, regardless of any emergent stance on some of the sub-topics. Oneaspect of this importance is the implicit variations in models of history encountered in magicalresearches. These include: conceptions in which time and history are de-emphasised or abolished;cyclic models of time, in which the term End of Days and other linear terms have to be understooddifferently, if they are relevant at all.In the survey which follows three influential eschatological backgrounds will be examined; eachhistorically relevant to the requirements and practical aspects underlying magical interests. While themodern reader may be unaware of it, these schemas have shaped many important magical traditions atevery turn. This survey is not a matter of advocating for one or the other, so much as identifying anddescribing them. In the course of doing so, various options will emerge, philosophical or religious,personal or practical. Some fundamental differences will hopefully be highlighted; particularlydistinctions in outlook and interpretation relevant to specific conceptions or even paths. This isnecessary, given the eclectic nature of magic in various periods. Due to this, incompatible notions areoften scrambled together. One default model is often taken as given at the expense of othercontributing traditions and interpretations. Our intention then is to separate certain key conceptions,permitting a more coherent relation between theory and practice within a given approach."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"TPLATONIC ESCHATOLOGYHE FUNDAMENTAL TENET of Platonic philosophy determines its eschatology. That is, physicalreality is but a pale reflection of an ideal world of abstract forms. This same separationbetween Spirit and Matter – in which Matter is essentially viewed very negatively – is,initially, carried over into what modern academia calls Neoplatonism; which is to say, the Platonicschool under Plotinus (204–270 CE) and his successors.It may perplex some readers when I say initially; as this impression of Neoplatonism has beenretained to the present, looking back. Since we are dealing with models of history on a secondarylevel, this reverse linearity has some relevance. At this point, and subsequently, Neoplatonism mayusefully be considered going forward in its own time; as a continually evolving movement at thecentre of intellectual culture. In this sense, Plotinus was the founder of Neoplatonism, and his pupilPorphyry essentially his successor (in reality all were successors and commentators on Plato andearlier traditions). The very next great leader and thinker in Neoplatonism, the pupil of Porphyry,rescued Platonic thought from this world hating dualism. He would be revered for it in his own time,as also in the Renaissance. Thus considered as a linear development in time, Neoplatonism had foundan answer to this problem within Platonic thought. Found it, what is more, in the third century of ourera. This is what I meant by initially.An enduring influence exists from Platonism upon Christian eschatology, which has twofundamental types: the Spiritual – near identical to Plato’s, essentially Christian Neoplatonism – andNew Creation, which is physical and entirely different.In the Platonic schemas a body/soul duality exists alongside the division of spiritual and physicalworlds. The objective of existence is escape from the physical world and reuniting with the One inthe transcendent world. Matter, according to this perspective, is the lowest form of reality, and thebody is essentially the prison, even the tomb, of the soul. The same conception prevails in many formsof Gnosticism.Emanation schemes, whereby multiple degrees of existence derived from the One precede ourphysical realm, are typical of Neo-platonism. Such systems as Gnosticism and Kabbalah essentiallyinherit this from Plato and his successors. The first of these emanations from the One is Mind (nous),otherwise called Intellect, a term that recurs in the writings of Iamblichus and dominates theChaldean Oracles. Beneath this is Soul, which experiences both Time and Space, indeed causes themto exist. In consequence Soul perceives the sphere above it, the world of Mind, and the Natural worldbelow it. The universe perceived by Soul is composed of increasingly dense levels culminating in thematerial world.The individual soul therefore seeks to rise through successive levels of this layered reality. As wellas various completely abstract levels and subdivisions, these typically include worlds correspondingto the planetary heavens and the world of fixed stars. Above these are Boundless Space and – insubsequent developments – the Prime Mover. The relation of these to magical eschatology was shownin various modes in my Geosophia. Their relation to the various spirit hierarchies in magical usetoday follows naturally from these examples; only the eschatological context is often overlooked."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"TPLATONISM AND CHRISTIAN ESCHATOLOGYHE INFLUENCE OF PLATO and Greek thought is known to have been a major causal influence ofand upon the Renaissance. From here, we are informed, a more sophisticated and philosophicalWestern magic, including an explosion of grimoires, took its cue. Ficino, Mirandola, Agrippaand others are regularly cited in this regard. However, it would be a great mistake to perceive thisinfusion of Neoplatonism into Western Christian Hermeticism to be the first harmonious meeting ofChristian and Classical thought. Early Christian theology, developing among the Hellenised nations ofthe Near East and Asia Minor, was largely approving of Plato.The roster of Church Fathers impressed and influenced by him reads like a Who’s Who of the earlyChurch: Clement, Origen, Augustine &c. It was even believed that he had been inspired by God, orthat he was acquainted with the wisdom of Moses. Such similarities were perceived indeed betweenChristian theology and Platonic thought, that it was assumed that intellectual pagans would beresponsive to the Christian message in direct consequence. What we might describe as AlexandrianPlatonist Christian theology was prominent among the Church Fathers.The exegetical methods of the great Jewish Platonist Philo, who interpreted the Old Testament inPlatonic terms, were a powerful influence on Clement. Such approaches also, incidentally, underliethe Kabbalah. More important for our purposes is the influence of Origen, in particular uponeschatology. Both Clement and Origen were influenced by Platonism and Stoicism in their exegesis ofscripture. Theologians of the Alexandrian tradition endeavoured to demonstrate Christianity’sfulfilment of the best of Greek philosophy. Clement of Alexandria (150–215) took the lead of Philo inpursuing an allegorical interpretation of the scriptures, seeking moral and philosophical truth inhistorical narratives. Clement compared the role of philosophy with the Law of Moses, one preparingthe gentiles for Christ, the other the Jews; placing Plato as essentially equal to Moses. While he didnot view the body as evil he certainly viewed matter – and the flesh – as inferior to spirit in line withPlatonic thought. In this way Platonic eschatology – resurrection in the spirit – displaced thescriptural expectation of a physical resurrection in the flesh, a new life in a redeemed Creation.Origen was an out and out Platonist in this respect; specifically, in the view that the resurrection bodywas not material but purely spiritual.The Alexandrian school was not alone in this regard. Saint Augustine, the most influential oftheologians, was powerfully influenced by Platonism and says as much in his Confessions. Hisattitude towards Neoplatonism is more complex, since he was a bitter opponent of Theurgy; but thisdid not prevent use of theurgic ideas in defining Eucharistic theory!As regards eschatology in particular, Augustine is as Platonic as Origen. His City of God isultimately heavenly, rather than earthly. He equated the political power of the Church with the reignof the risen Christ predicted in Revelation. This, of course, is still official Catholic doctrine. Thescriptural idea of a resurrection in the body, when the dead shall rise from their tombs on the Day ofJudgment, has been almost entirely forgotten. Thus, in short, Christian theology and Western thought –popular and learned – are powerfully influenced by Platonic thinking. In particular, much Christianeschatology, both Catholic and popular, is dominated by the Platonic spiritualising conception."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"TRESTITUTIONISMNature persuadeth us that there are pure dæmons, and that evil germs of matter may alikebecome useful and good.Chaldean Oracles31 · Marchosias is a great Marquis, appearing in the form of a ferocious she wolf with griffin’swings and a serpent’s tail, and spitting I know not what from his mouth. In human shape he is anexcellent fighter, he answereth all questions truly, he is faithful in all the conjuror’s commands;he was of the Order of Dominations, and under him are 30 legions; he hopes after 1200 yearsto return to the Seventh Throne, but he is deceived in that hope.Goetia of SolomonHE IDEA IN THE SECOND ABOVE QUOTATION, in various forms, in reference to this spirit andothers, is present in Weyer, the Goetia and Scot’s Discoverie. All ultimately depend on Weyer,and it is interesting to consider what part he played in its precise form. The name of this idea isRestitutionism (or, approximately, Universalism). It is an old idea, appearing for example in theChaldean Oracles which in turn implies a similar concept within Neo-platonism. In a Christiancontext the idea is associated with Origen among others. It is also controversial, being either upheldor opposed by a variety of Christian sects. Although the word has other meanings in a variety ofcontexts, here it involves the idea that no-one is excluded from God’s grace, and after an indefiniteperiod of purgation all sinners will enter heaven. The purpose of Creation is good, and the process ofpurgation serves the ultimate purpose of banishing evil from the Universe. Though generally appliedto human souls, the purpose of banishing of evil through purging logically extends the concept tospirits of various kinds. That is, assuming that they are immortal and thus not subject to annihilation;an idea that is not universally held of all spirits.Origen’s ideas were long deemed heretical (he is nowadays once more valued as an importantthinker, and even endorsed as such by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI). It is interesting to wonder if thetext Weyer presents in his Pseudomonarchia originally simply stated the hope of the spirit. CertainlyWeyer adulterated and edited the text, and it is by no means clear how much of what he gives includeshis own comments or adaptations. It is therefore quite possible that he added the rider that he isdeceived, which is elsewhere more indignantly expressed. In any case Origenist tendencies in theGoetia are not out of place, and underline the eschatological significance of spirits and working withthem. Recall too that the assumption that spells and divinations involve a tacit pact with spirits alsostems from Origen (TG 132).Incidentally, Origen is directly named elsewhere in the text of the Lemegeton; in ‘The PreliminaryDefinition of Magic’ (not to be confused with Crowley’s misleading addition, the so-called ‘InitiatedInterpretation’). This concept of universal penance and absolution, in the context of an eschatologicalprocess, approximates closely to the return to the One in Platonism, and the re-absorption into thePleroma of Gnosticism. It implies an all embracing and continual process of evolution, through trial.Although the rejection of Universalism has cooled in contemporary Catholicism, it is traditionally"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Iamong the points distinguishing mainstream Catholic eschatology from Plato’s and others.Relevant here are the other traditional distinctions, which also play their role in occult thought, be itSpiritism or others. These are the pre-existence of human souls before birth, and metempsychosis ortransmigration of souls. Such ideas may have a role to play when considering time, either linear orcyclic, as the arena of a process of spiritual evolution. Both of these may be usefully consideredalongside Restitutionism as potential components of the process, depending how it is defined andunderstood.Anglophone Spiritualism was originally opposed to the idea of reincarnation (transmigration), whileKardecian Spiritism, in common with Theosophy, was not. A series of existences, whether embodiedor otherwise, is fairly natural to an eschatological theory. Traditional Christian theology on the otherhand proposes one birth – with no previous existence for the soul – with the entire purgatory processoccurring in this life and the next, which is eternal. Spiritualism in its original form also tended to thisview; though the spirit after death worked its way through various stages towards perfection, it did soin one prolonged existence rather than a series. Hinduism, more usefully in some respects, supposes aseries of existences, but not necessarily upon the same plane or sphere, or in the same form. Thisbrings us close to the magical (and Neoplatonist) model of eschatology: an ascent through worlds, inthe process taking on new forms appropriate to these spheres. Whether these existences are physicallyembodied or no is largely inconsequential for our purposes.The remarks on the original form of the transmigration theory in Geosophia are relevant here. Thatis, such a doctrine originated within initiated sects or clans, it applied only to the initiated and wasnever intended to be understood as universal. We can certainly understand that there is a potentialrole for such a concept within a model of history involving the evolution of souls or spirits. It is noton that account to be automatically considered an indispensable doctrine.Essentially our ‘rule of thumb’ model supposes a prolonged existence, of which our present earthlylife is but a part. This existence is a process of purification and learning, and may be divided intostages – whether or not we consider these as separate existences or phases of a continuous existence.These phases or lives occur within a scale; the components of which are usefully described as worldsor spheres: be they hells, heavens or planetary and stellar worlds. Within this model a series ofphysical lives may be the exception or the norm, but humans in physical form and as souls areengaged in the same process. So too are other classes of spirits, some of which may once have beenhuman but have degenerated or evolved into other types. Within this framework there are potentialmotives and benefits for spirits to engage in inter-action with humans, and indeed vice versa.The Background of RestitutionismT IS NOT CERTAIN that Origen taught Restitutionism, or whether this is more correctly attributedto later ‘Origenists.’ Nevertheless the doctrine is historically associated with him and his placein this discussion is entirely appropriate. Clement of Alexandria and the Old and NewTestaments were potent and important influences on him. Nevertheless, the influence of bothPlatonism and Stoicism on his thought was prominent and important. Much of our discussion hasemphasised Neoplatonism, however a related idea, Apokatastasis, was first clearly stated in Stoiccircles. In particular by Chrysippus (died 207 BCE) whose voluminous works systemised Stoicthought. This concept, like much else in Stoicism’s astrological worldview, derived from thesophisticated astronomical philosophy of the Chaldeans."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Nevertheless Apokatastasis has a place in Christian theology via the New Testament, as forexample Colossians 1:19–22:19: For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;20: And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things untohimself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.21: And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yetnow hath he reconciled22: In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable andunreproveable in his sight: Note that fullness is the English translation of the ‘Gnostic’ term Pleroma: this refers to the source ofall, to which all returns through the process under discussion.II Corinthians 5:18–20:18: And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hathgiven to us the ministry of reconciliation;19: To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing theirtrespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.20: Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we prayyou in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. In some modern Protestant theology Restitutionism and Apokatastasis are seen as related to, but notidentical with, Universalism. This latter concept, in various forms, involves a similar premise: theultimate salvation of all mankind, that none are damned or blotted out. However it has less room forspirits, be they saints or demons, angels or elementals. So too some Protestant attitudes to cultpractices of various types can be limiting.Universalism also questions the existence of Hell and Purgatory. In the more ‘old school’ form ofApokatastasis or Restitutionism as it relates to magic, these, while impermanent, do not vanish in apuff of theology. Purgatory particularly is a most useful concept in expressing both European andAfrican derived traditions concerning the dead. Likewise Hell, although not a place of perpetualtorment but of purgation, retains significance in a schema involving certain spirit entities.In Restitutionism all rational beings are reconciled with and reabsorbed into God (the One ofPlatonism). The entirety of Creation is purged and reconciled with its Creator; in which very conceptwe are reminded that elements, places, trees, stones, all things are inhabited or presided over byspirits. For these, as for human souls, there is no eternal damnation. There is instead redemptivesuffering: expiating our faults and limitations in order to progress and evolve. The associated modelof history, which is generally linear in Christian and modern Western secular understanding, is aprocess involving all spirits, human souls among them. This process is evolutionary, involving theelimination of evil (which cannot therefore be absolute). By it we are fitted and enabled to come evercloser to God, so that in the End all rational beings participate in the Beatific Vision.Restitutionism and Western magic"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THIS IDEA HAS BEEN DEEPLY INFLUENTIAL upon magical thinking in various guises. Of particularinterest in this study are those surrounding elemental spirits, as defined (or redefined) byParacelsus. From Paracelsus this develops into a full blown magical current, whoseprotagonists will be familiar to many, if not in this context. The subsequent influence of Paracelsusupon the author of the Comte de Gabalis should be no surprise to anyone. The Comte was very closeto Paracelsus in even his central thesis, that elementals attained immortality through union withhumans. This ‘ensoulment’ obviously gave such spirits a place in heaven in the Last Days, in otherwords it serves an eschatological purpose. Nor is this the least of it, Martinism also held to theRestitutionist doctrine, with of course a formative effect upon works of evocation. So too, likely byMartinist influence, did Eliphas Lévi; indeed Lévi either interpreted or glossed certain grimoires withthis idea in mind.

Itsorigins as a magico-mystical tradition began in high grade Masonry in the mid 18th century. Itwas founded by the key figure of Martinez de Pasqually and continued by various students,including Louis Claude de Saint Martin. In essence it is an esoteric Christian school with distincteschatological emphases: the Fall and its consequences, and the way of return. Although using slightlydifferent terminology the doctrine underlying its practice is essentially a form of Restitutionism,known in Martinist circles by the terms Reintegration and Illumination.In its original form as organised by Pasqually a distinctly theurgic method of achieving reintegrationwas practiced by an order known as the Élus-Coëns. That is to say, this grouping was distinctlymagical in outlook and methodology. Other forms have employed Masonry as a vehicle for Martinistteachings without the methodology. Others still have been purely Masonic, with Martinismrepresenting a nominal link relevant to charters in the curious way such bodies have from time totime. Needless to say it is the teaching and its practical application by theurgic means that interests ushere. Finally, there are the teachings of Saint-Martin, which emphasised an internal method ofachieving reintegration, which we might compare with Platonic contemplation as opposed to physicaltheurgic praxis.Martinism, as mentioned, is a form of esoteric Christianity. As such various Martinist thinkers pastand present have acknowledged the links of the core ideas back to Origen. This emphasis is valid ofcourse; ‘Origenist’ restitution and Martinist reintegration are essentially synonyms. At the same timewe should not lose track of the confluence of Christian ideas represented by Origen, and the Neo-platonist and pagan concepts of theurgy represented by Iamblichus. As regards Martinism, the Élus-Coëns represent the main focus of our attention; more specifically the ideas embodied within it, asMasonic matters are not my concern. Fairly conventionally the Order was organised with equivalentsto the Craft Degrees as an outer order. An intermediate series of grades in which the inner teachingswere hinted at followed. Only the third series of innermost degrees taught openly and practicedtheurgic rites. These, as the reader must suspect already, involved evocation of spirit beings. Oneaspect of these that is important enough to emphasise here is the intention to attain the Beatific Visionin life, as opposed to in the post mortem state. In this Martinism was not necessarily breaking with thepast, as this exact same intention is present in one of the earliest grimoires, Liber Juratus. Finally,before moving on to more central tasks, it should be noted that a key figure in the survival ofMartinism and its reorganisation was the occultist Papus. This is significant for a variety of reasonssince Papus is a key figure in modern occult history; not least as an enthusiastic promoter of the worksof Eliphas Lévi.Restitutionism and ElementalsYou must thoroughly understand that elemental beings are souls of an imperfect type, not yetraised in the scale up to human existence, and that they can only manifest power when calledinto action by the adept ...Lévi, The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE INFLUENCE OF RESTITUTIONISM on some of Lévi’s most central ideas is extensive; includingthe rituals that he bequeathed to subsequent generations. It is of course part of the legend of Lévithat he too was greatly impressed by Paracelsus; he recorded a cherished dream wherein thegreat man spoke to him. So too Lévi worked with the idea of Elementals in mind, and provided uswith the ritual known as the Conjuration of the Four. Embedded within this rite are the elementalprayers, including the Prayer of the Salamanders, transcribed from Porphyry by the author of theComte. It is likely that Lévi, or an unknown source influential upon him, was the composer of thethree remaining prayers.Paracelsus provided the idea of Elemental races, reinterpreting pagan survivals and contemporaryfolklore in the process. His thesis also utterly and explicitly disowned the idea that such species weredemonic. Lévi meanwhile is the apparent source for the names of their Kings (and Queens, accordingto Cyprian); Djin, King of the Salamanders; Nicksa, Queen of the Undines, Paralda, Queen of theSylphs; Ghob, King of the Gnomes. These names have yet to be traced any further back than the worksof Lévi (by Joseph Peterson or yours truly). The context within which they appear involvesrestitution, by gaining the wherewithal for evolution the elementals benefit directly from magicalrites.Nor is this Lévi’s personal spin; preceding him are Paracelsus, the Martinists and Rosicruciansrepresented by the Comte. All, in their various ways, are restitutionist links in the chain leading toboth ritual and names of the chiefs. So too the Lansdowne ms of the Key represents similar ideas, alsoconcerning elementals.

The origins of Spiritualism in the 19th century are to be sought in America,from where it became virtually a global phenomenon. It was not closely linked to thevarious occult movements of the English speaking world. In consequence modern magicians and otherexponents of the occult revival often have a limited knowledge of the subject, jaundiced by hostiledepictions of it in the writings of Crowley and others. In non-Anglophone occultism, for example inHispanic and Portuguese speaking New World traditions, this relationship is wholly different. Oftenthe key figure here is a Frenchman, Hypolite Léon Denizard Rivail, better known under thepseudonym Allan Kardec. In his system and its offshoots Spiritism rather than Spiritualism is theaccepted term, and there are important differences between the two. On the other hand there arecertain traits in common between them, which we here briefly summarise before a more detailedappraisal of those elements most important to this work.Both Spiritism and Spiritualism involve the concept of an immortal spirit that survives death.Additionally there is a belief that these spirits of the dead can communicate with the living,particularly through mediums; persons who by special gifts or training are particularly gifted in thisrespect. Spiritualism is seen in different ways by those involved; as a religion, a philosophy, even ascience or art, or combinations thereof. Spiritism is generally seen as a practical and scientificphilosophy, although in the New World it is often practiced alongside Palo Mayombe, Santeria,Kimbanda and so on. What is frequently taken for ‘New Orleans Voodoo’ is in fact more often a formof Spiritism with local elements. The Hispanic name Espiritismo indicates the same Kardeciantradition. Allan Kardec’s influence in Brazil dates to 1858, after at least 40 years of theosophical andspiritualist influence from elsewhere. As Frisvold informs us (Kiumbanda 24):The basic tenets of Kardec’s philosophy were a Christian oriented moral philosophy wherecharity was the focus. As most people know spiritism had as the goal communication with thedead in what was called a séance. [His] Book of Spirits ... gave answers on most existentialdilemmas people suffered from and opened a window to the enigmatic afterlife. The foundation ofthis philosophy has its basis in man being a spiritual being, the body simply serving as a vesselfor the spirit. The spirit has also a semi-material texture [where] the personality is located, so ina way this semi-material part of our spirit body, called perispirit, is the element that makescommunication possible. When the body falls away in death the spirit lives on in its semi-material condition. The personality one had while being in the physical vessel lives on in thiscondition. Usually the perispirit is not visible, but it can be perceived in the right circumstances.The purpose of life on earth is to present us with a series of ordeals the spirit needs to passthrough until it achieves moral perfection. Consequently we find the belief in reincarnation andpast lives crucial for our evolution and moral growth. There is also a hierarchy of spirits that isconstructed by allegory. This means that a good man will turn into a good spirit and an evil maninto an evil spirit. The classes Kardec operated with were superior, medium, inferior and evil.The evil needed to evolve into a superior state of spirit. The superior spirits are considered tofollow the example of Jesus Christ, advocating good action and benevolence. Therecommendation is that all of us should make ourselves as useful in society as possible. In the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Iafterlife nothing is hidden and we need to account for all our shortcomings and acts of evil bygoing through ordeals that elevate our moral sense.Communication with the dead, the common aspect of Spiritism and Spiritualism alike, obviouslyimplies a post mortem existence. The ontological premise underlying this is dualistic, in that humanbeings consist of material and spiritual parts, a body and an immortal spirit. The material world ofour senses is only one dimension of a more complex and interconnected cosmos. Other spheres ofexistence interpenetrate our own, underlying some of the phenomena such systems profess todemonstrate, employ and seek to explain. Within this a key concept is that of spiritual and moralgrowth through multiple existences, and of more and less evolved worlds. Spiritism emphasisesreincarnation within such a schema, while Spiritualism generally perceives such evolution asoccurring largely in the spirit world. A rare example of reincarnation within the latter worldview isthat of teachers returning to earth from a higher plane. This in turn may imply a reincarnation path forinitiates, rather than for all. However, within both systems and particularly the former, spirits mayincarnate on higher worlds. In Kardecian thought these are readily comparable to the Neoplatonicplanetary spheres, or the ‘spiritual planets’ of Hinduism.Despite the relatively recent origins of Spiritism and Spiritualism, there are ancient precedents,both practical and theoretical. Belief in an afterlife and communication with the dead was and is notuncommon in many cultures. Given their importance in the history of Western magic the beliefs of theancient Egyptians deserve our attention. So too do various aspects of Greek belief, as well as ofAfrican and other cultures.The Seven Heavens in Spiritualist ThoughtN POST-MORTEM EXISTENCE the first astral plane is termed the first heaven or lower astral plane;a realm resembling Hell or Purgatory. Escaping this realm involves coming to terms with pastmisdeeds and other such anti-evolutionary tendencies. This is envisaged as slow and arduous,possibly taking many hundreds of years of earth time. Naturally its inhabitants are not the mostpleasant persons, including criminals and self-centred types. Demonic spirits originate here,representing spirits who have built up greater power, and this negative evolution distinguishes themfrom the typical troubled souls found here. Being close to the earth plane they have little problemeffecting persons or events there. These spirits closely resemble those of the lower forms ofnecromancy encountered in the magical papyri. Such practices underlie the demonology of the latergrimoires, whether or not these conceptualise such spirits in this way. Other phenomena, such asthose associated with Ouija boards or poltergeists, also originate here.The second astral plane is termed the second heaven; the majority of the dead initially findthemselves in the intermediate subdivisions of this heaven. Above it there are upper dimensions, andthe second heaven represents a kind of convalescence and preparation phase between earthly life andhigher planes of spiritual existence. It is very similar to the earth plane, being an idealised form ofearthly life constructed from thought emanations of its residents. They possess etheric counterparts ofphysical forms and domestic life etc., as convincing to themselves as to seers from this plane.Nevertheless, such physicality is only a semblance, were they to visit us, they would be invisible tothe great majority. In Spiritualist thought this is the source of the larger part of spirit communications.Being still a fairly lowly part of the spiritual universe, its communications are prone to error andconfusion."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The third astral plane bears many names, although it is sufficient for us to identify it as the thirdheaven or Summerland. This plane closely resembles many ideas of the afterlife, including theChristian Paradise. The purer souls moving on from earth life pass directly to this realm. Othersrequire a period of self-analysis and development in the second heaven. As mentioned earlier, inSpiritualist thought reincarnation for all is not an accepted tenet. Nevertheless it is held by some thatit may occur as a matter of individual choice, generally in pursuit of some unlearned lesson; these, themajority of reincarnating spirits, return from this third heaven. Other spirits abandon earthly life fromthis point and their further evolution occurs entirely in the higher spiritual planes. Communicationsfrom spirits on this level are of a higher type than those mentioned above. That is, dependent on type,they possess a greater degree of profundity or accuracy.

So mote it be; Amen.The Gnostic MassT IS MY CONTENTION that the role of the dead has been largely excised from Western magic, incontrast to every other tradition in the world. A tremendous gap of comprehension arises inconsequence, as well as crippling losses to magic in terms of rationale, social relevance,comparative understanding and a variety of other respects.The main thrust of my argument concerns mainstream Western magic, as derived from the grimoires.Implied too is subsequent effects upon ceremonial magic of various types in the modern period. Theexceptions to my critique are largely to be found in other areas of contemporary Western magic, aswell as in older folklore, spiritualism and elsewhere. Though important, these exceptions areseparate from the historical mainstream of Western ceremonial magic, and their existence does notalter my main points.As my writings are intended to clarify, the grimoire tradition has its roots not in a mythicalSolomon, but a very real background in ancient Greece and the later Hellenistic world. This is wherethe term goetia has its origin and derives its real context. Some major themes have been obscured inthe historical life of this most central of all strands of Western magic, and this chapter deals withsome of them.The literary lineage of the grimoire tradition chronologically is the Orphic books, the magicalpapyri and the Byzantine literature which derived from them. This stream eventually bumped intomedieval Christianity and the Renaissance Neoplatonists. The impact of this produced the grimoires,and altered the original conception in various ways. Among these was wholesale use of barbarousnames derived from the Kabbalah. This is readily comparable to use of barbarous names in earlierperiods, and presents relatively few major difficulties of continuity. One such difficulty is thatmodern magicians have become convinced that they have to study the Kabbalah in order to operate,and can more or less ignore the Greco-Roman inheritance completely. This response is somethingRenaissance mages – who were inspired by access to Hellenistic literature from the Arab andByzantine worlds – would have found nonsensical. It is also a historical absurdity; certainly theSolomonic grimoires are a major part of our magical heritage, but it is equally important tounderstand their real roots, and in some cases return to them.Another more drastic alteration in the genre was the near erasure of references to the dead as activeagencies in magical operations. The Church was often much more accommodating of old customs thanhas been thought. However, ancient funerary rites and cultic reverence for the ancestors formed amajor exception, they were entirely too ‘pagan’ and too linked to magical practices. Consequently theChurch very largely took on complete responsibility for this aspect of human existence, as well as"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"introducing new ideological perspectives. Many of these are interesting in their own right; forexample the role of Purgatory in permitting the African Diaspora to employ Christian frames ofreference in adapting their traditions to the New World.For the most part however the dead became separated from magical lore in accord with the newdoctrine, with far reaching negative consequences. Most obviously, the varied roles of the dead inarchaic goetia were largely lost. Texts like the Goetia of Solomon essentially replaced the dead, whowere the chief agencies of Hellenistic magic, with fallen angels. Aside from the heavenly angels andsome few others, spirits of this type are nowadays seen as the active spirits of much of the entiregrimoire genre. In texts such as Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy however at least someof them bear an alternative title: aerial demons. As I have shown in Geosophia, this title points totheir real origin in Hellenistic lore. In short, this same title originally designated the dead of pre-Christian goetia.The Key of Solomon has no chapter devoted to the important topic of necromancy. That this shouldbe lacking, while there is a comparatively trivial chapter on causing a hunter to fail in catching anygame, is certainly striking. That it is a deliberate omission is suggested by the presence in the timingsection of the grimoire to lunar positions and planetary days and hours suitable for conjuring the dead.In an essay entitled ‘Of Occult Philosophy, or of Magical Ceremonies: the Fourth Book,’ in theFourth Book, Agrippa records magical ceremonies of the early grimoire era. Therein the dead, aswell as nature spirits, are still enumerated among those conjured by magicians of his time. More orless precise instructions are given, and suggest that magicians of his time were involved in just suchoperations.Aside from such rare indications, the dead appear to have been largely excised from the grimoireliterature. Generally speaking, the only sign of their former status in the grimoires as they stand is theoccasional ghost. These, summoned at the graveside, beside a gibbet or at the scene of a suicide,were all of the lowest type and comparatively recently deceased. In the older systems the dead didnot form such a simple and lowly blanket category, they were arranged in a hierarchy with manyparallels – or edited borrowings – in Qabalistic spirit hierarchies. Some were considered asthousands of years old, no tampering with corpses was necessary in such cases. Many were in factdeceased magicians or initiates, an important example being the dactyls of Mount Ida. These wererevered founders of traditions upon which the entire Western magical tradition has its remotest roots.When we consider how supposed demons are often treated by modern occultists, this former statusshould at very least give us pause for thought. Dead magicians – re-titled demons in a later era – maybe none too pleased with their latter day counterparts. Indeed, unless magic evolves appropriately,some modern magicians may be equally dismayed when their time comes.In the earlier forms of the tradition there is, quite simply, no precedent for the virtual absence of thedead from the major grimoires. Nor are they absent in other magical traditions worldwide, fromwhich we would otherwise be able to learn a good deal more readily. Oddly the term necromancyhung around, although transmogrified – possibly to conceal the peculiarity of this change – into theterm nigromancy; thus hiding the change under the term black divination which makes no real sensewhatsoever. It has also not lost its associations with Goetic magic, even though the link between themhas become somewhat amorphous.This is a strange situation, and one which a good many grimoire magicians would rather ignoreperhaps, as it requires adjustments and rethinking. However, in reality some of the practical changesare relatively slight. As Aaron Leitch has pointed out, the rites of the Key of Solomon are notaddressed to any particular spirits, but simply summons those that might be available without"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"identifying them. There is in fact a world of difference in the conception underlying the Key, and thatunderlying the Goetia of Solomon.Greater difficulties arise in adjusting the latter to a truly necromantic (and thus properly goetic)perspective. Geosophia focuses a strong and penetrating light on this important but neglected issue.This is necessary for various reasons, chief of which is that goetic magic is the only genuinelycontinuous tradition in the whole corpus of Western magic, and is the root of much else within it. It istherefore intolerable that the very term should be misunderstood as a reference to a book writtenthousands of years after the term was coined. In this mistaken form some of the most importantelements of the tradition are completely absent; the dead being perhaps the most important of all.Necromancy survived more visibly in the activities of the cunning men, folk customs and laterSpiritualism. These customs and beliefs were however no part of the Golden Dawn/Crowleysynthesis, and are very largely absent from the grimoires, though for different reasons. This, alongwith a certain prejudice against Spiritualism on the part of Crowley, and the ambivalent relationshipit had with Theosophy, have had a dramatic effect on the modern synthesis. Absent from the Westernmagical tradition today, among both moderns and traditionalists, is what we might call a welldeveloped practical eschatology. This is so fundamental and all encompassing a component both infolk and classical religion that its absence, once noted, is truly bizarre.An important rider is that the modern Western magical tradition so called is largely a product of theEnglish speaking and Protestant world. These observations do not therefore hold true among Africanor Hispanic traditions, even though modern magic is penetrating South American occultism and viceversa. It is worth while taking a step back from modern Anglophone magic and re-examining theGoetia of Solomon prior to its modern status. This is largely derived from its Mathers/Crowleyconnections, whatever modern traditionalists may claim about a focus reaching back before theGolden Dawn/Thelemic synthesis. The GoS is a few centuries old, but 1640 CE is still early modern.It is notable too that manuscripts of this grimoire only exist in English. So it is not especially old andother grimoires entirely are more important in Hispanic, Nordic and Germanic cultures and formercolonies etc. In short it is a not especially important part of a much wider genre, rather than a uniqueand universal scripture; which English speaking magicians seem to treat it as nowadays.Next question, what is goetia anyway? It is a much older term than 1640, and originally had nothingwhatever to do with fallen angels. It had a whole lot more to do with the dead: goetia and necromancyare – or at least were – virtually equivalent terms prior to popular usage in recent anglophone circles.Dealings with the dead were central to late Greco-Roman magic, as well as important in late PaganEuropean religion in general. It is a fact that funerary customs were an area where the Church wasless tolerant than of other customs. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the clerical undergroundedited classical magic into the grimoire form to reflect this change of emphasis: the dead, in all theirvariety, were largely excised, and replaced by fallen angels i.e. demons.It is interesting to note that the dead who remain in grimoire practice are virtually always of thelower echelons (executed criminals, suicides and other angry or restless ghosts) omitting ancestors,heroes and demigods who were important categories before. The one exception is the Saints,generally omitted by modern Pagans adapting these sources, and frequently misunderstood by moreconventional grimoirists.As mentioned above, another important term for evil spirits in Western magic is aerial demons (seeAgrippa et al). If we trace this back to its Greek roots it is strongly connected with the dead as aboisterous but by no means exclusively evil category of spirits (see Plutarch, Iamblichus et al). Thisconnection has been suppressed in the grimoire tradition as we inherit it."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Thus aside from the angels of safe or permitted magic (sic), grimoire spirits are called evil andmisidentified as fallen angels for largely theological reasons unconnected to – and corrosive of – themagical tradition itself. The misidentification is made even worse in the influential Golden Dawnredrafting and its successors. There the term qlipoth is applied to spirits (and magic) with little if anyreal connection with Kabbalah. It is of course impossible to force spirits like Vassago into such acategory with any conviction. Only the secondary role of spirits in modern magic makes suchinconsistencies invisible.That planetary angels and demons are two sides of the same coin is largely a matter of historicalfact, and the ambivalent nature of the archons has been cited already. Incidentally, note thefacelessness of most angels in the grimoires, compared to the much clearer personalities of thedemons. Also note that – as various authors ancient and modern have observed – planetary and otherastrological spirits are as likely to be called demons as angels. They are, in many respects, the samecritters, forced into a dualistic straitjacket.There will be technical issues so long as we continue to overemphasise the GoS and imagine theKabbalah rather than Classical magic to be the main root of our traditions. A comparison of ancientgoetia with the practice of the African Traditional Religions is in fact essential to the growth ofmodern magic and cannot be sidestepped to any advantage. The influence of the ATRs is becoming allembracing, and the potential for a synthesis that we can participate in meaningfully requires us to re-examine the real origins of Western magic and the nature of the spirits.So we come finally to the crux of the issue, the matter of eschatology. In modern magic we areaccustomed to attributing various spirits and ranks of spirit to the rungs of a celestial ladder, theforemost example being the Tree of Life. So too we envisage ourselves ascending this ladder invarious ways, either on a journey (path working), as stages of attainment (qabalistic grades etc.) andso on. Both are relatively recent in the terms in which they currently are envisaged. A century or soago the higher grades of the Tree were seen as attainable only after death (it was Crowley whopopularised the idea of Crossing the Abyss while in life). So too once we examine the roots ofpathworkings or astral journeys upon the Tree, it is clear they are more a foretaste than the mainevent. This leads us to consider the spirits associated with these realms – and indeed ourselves –from a perspective at once new and unspeakably archaic.Firstly let us re-examine the context outlined above: there is a clear connection between the ideasof a journey and of an incremental process of attainment through grades attributed to the sequence ofrungs. This portrays an evolutionary process in which the post mortem state is implicit in some stagesat very least. Once this information is added back into the equation it can be seen that the spiritsoccupying these realms are not mere picturesque residents for the edification of astral tourists. Theyare beings at various stages of evolution, among whom we may expect to be enlisted at various pointsof our future evolution. When that is, our journey is not a foretaste of what is to come but the mainevent.Clearly the entire idea of a spirit realm, and of dealings with spirits, has an eschatological basiswhich has been lost sight of in the modern era. The evolutionary process is one in which both initiatesand spirits alike have a very real interest. This provides a context in which spirits have motives forwishing to work with us. In the default modern model such a motive is virtually absent; they areportrayed essentially as unpaid tradesmen or shopkeepers who pander to magicians for no apparentreason other than coercion. This is – to say the least – philosophically unsatisfying. Once Westernmagic acknowledges and reconnects with the central neglected aspect of its very origins, occultismbecomes more satisfying and meaningful for practitioners and aspirants, but also potentially for the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"wider community."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"APARACELSUSN INTERLUDE IS NECESSARY before introducing our next text. The name Paracelsus arose inconnection with the term Arbatel in the Book of Saint Cyprian, and there are ideas in theIberian texts as a whole that speak of his influence. His reintroduction of magical botany andmineralogy are immensely significant to our theme; reinvigorating and reinstating major aspects of thetechnical Hermetica. For this and other reasons he demands an examination before proceedingfurther.For some writers on occult matters at least, it is easy to like Paracelsus. He was irascible,outspoken and irreverent on the one hand, a groundbreaking, innovative and effective physician on theother. Ellic Howe’s description commends him to us: During his lifetime Paracelsus was theeternal outsider, a stormy petrel who was detested or ignored by the conservative ... [already] alegendary personality when he died. There is noticeable warmth too in Seligmann’s description inhis History of Magic. Barrett demonstrates his enthusiasm for Paracelsus in his Magus; among a hostof sober literary portraits with one to three line titles, that of Paracelsus is distinguished by a far moregrandiose header:PHILIPPUS AUREOLUS THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUSBOMBAST DE HOENHEYM,THE PRINCE OF PHYSICIANS & PHILOSOPHERS BY FIRE;GRAND PARADOXICAL PHYSICIAN;THE TRISMEGISTUS OF SWITZERLAND;FIRST REFORMER OF CHYMICAL PHILOSOPHY;ADEPT IN ALCHYMY, CABALA, AND MAGIC;NATURE’S FAITHFUL SECRETARY; MASTER OFTHE ELIXIR OF LIFE & THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE;& THE GREAT MONARCH OF CHYMICAL SECRETS;NOW LIVING IN HIS TOMB, WHITHER HE RETIREDDISGUSTED WITH THE VICES & FOLLIES OF MANKIND,SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN QUINTESSENTIA VITÆ.Paracelsus was a hard drinking wanderer, who taught not in Latin but the vernacular, and on one ofhis visits to England spurned the ivory towers of Oxbridge to spend time in Cornish tin-mines; therehe opined, there was more to be learned. His close acquaintance with practical metallurgy and withmines is one of the noteworthy things I wish to draw the reader’s attention to.It is a cliché of ancient wise men that they travelled, usually to Egypt and Chaldea, although perhapsfar fewer actually did than were reputed to have done so. Paracelsus however scarcely stoppedtravelling during his entire life. He wandered through Europe, North Africa and Egypt, Asia Minorand Russia. In Russia he spent considerable time as a welcome guest among the Tartar tribes. In ashamanic culture a wandering healer is both a recognisable and a sacred person.His medical knowledge, based on practical experience, was truly prodigious and he is in manyrespects the founder of modern medicine. He was the liberator of medicine from centuries of untestedtradition by which his contemporaries murdered their patients. He was also, undoubtedly, an occultistand a pivotal innovator in occultism.

He is credited with inventingthe Alphabet of the Magi for use upon astrological healing talismans, to write angelic names. As thereis no prior trace of this particular alphabet – say in Trithemius’ compendium of magical scripts – theattribution is likely enough. Magical symbols abound in the Archidoxes of Magic, attributable to theschool of Paracelsus. The manufacture of the talismans shows an intimate knowledge of metallurgy,and his knowledge of this and of botany was considerable. Such characteristics, taken with his(re)defining of elemental spirits, recommended him to compilers of grimoires while simultaneouslyreinvigorating magical practice.He was a contemporary of Agrippa, and like him a pupil of Trithemius for a while. However,Paracelsus was no more an admirer of Agrippa’s magical writings than of hidebound medicaltradition. While he influenced the grimoires, it is idle to seek in him a model of the aristocratic angelmagician or the Faustian conjurer. While steeped in Neoplatonist and other traditional aspects ofoccultism, much divides him from both the clerical underground and doctrinal Theurgists such asMirandola. His shamanic contacts, his familiarity with mines and metals, his medical talismans, allpoint in quite another direction. These, with his reappraisal of elemental spirits, returned magic toarchaic roots while bringing it crashing into modern times. His links with the Cyprian literature arefairly evident even at so early a stage of our appreciation of it.

True, near the beginning is asection on astrology that includes planetary hours. These are – so to speak – grimoiric in tone andcontent, but the section is not broadcast as such. Nevertheless, after receiving some extracts translatedby Humberto Maggi my interest was piqued sufficiently that I obtained a full copy courtesy of FelixFrancisco Castro Vicente. What intrigued me about the extracts was some material relating to spiritsigils and astrological correspondences. The material included Belzebuth, Baalberith and the rulersof the four elements, amidst a Walpurgisnacht array of folklore demons. Closer examination showedthis material to be embedded in a chapter on Astrological Palmistry. It was preceded by a chapterwhose palmistry was of the conventional kind. This chapter however was anything but conventional.A full exposition of the material follows shortly.Another section of the so-called Heptameron deals with Rhabdomancy, or divining with rods.Embedded in this section is material overlapping with the treasure hunting theme; the divining rodoverlapping with the conjurer’s wand as in the Grand Grimoire. Closer, more extensive andenlightening overlaps of this kind are contained in the Book of Saint Cyprian. The chiromanticmaterial from the Heptameron however is of a remarkable nature, both original and insightful, as willnow be seen.

Aristotle says that it[hand reading] is an infallible science.HE BIBLICAL REFERENCES ARE AUTHENTIC, and common in chiromantic literature. So too there areunverified and likely unverifiable claims that Aristotle both employed and wrote on palmistry.An edition of Aristotle’s Masterpiece was published around 1738 in London which included achapter ‘Of Palmistry, showing the various judgments drawn from the hand.’ This was supposedlywritten in 350 Bce by Aristotle and consists of material underlying early 18th century palmistry. Thistext was republished in 1900 by William G. Benham in The Laws of Scientific Handreading.Similarly there is a tradition of a treatise by Homer, On the Lines of the Hands, not extant butreferred to by later writers. Paracelsus also held chiromancy in high regard; in De natura rerumI.xi.384 he says: chiromancy is a science that not only inspects the hands of men, but, moreover, italso considers all herbs, woods, flints, earths, and rivers – in a word, whatever has lines, veins,and wrinkles. Though trivialised by association with ‘dookering the gorgios’ and consequentlyneglected by modern occultists, palmistry has a long history. Its origins are definitely to be sought inthe ancient world. Mentions of its use in Kabbalistic circles are the tail end of a venerable traditionextending back to the Hellenistic world, the Middle East and Vedic India.

The text then continues with a discussion of a magicalalphabet and various sigils and characters. The clear inference is that such symbols derive from andmay be found in the lines of the hand. This is, to say the least, an intriguing and interesting idea;reminiscent of Spare’s hand and eye symbolism among other things.The magical alphabet, while providing equivalents for a Latinate series, is based on Sanskritcharacters. This is an unusual deviation from Hebrew-centric custom, & demonstrates somesophistication on the part of the compiler.

As regards the Four Kings, the ChiromanciaAstrologíca has surprises in store which will follow in their place.Leonard, although sporting a name that scarcely suggests diabolism, is identical with the Sabbatgoat worshipped by the witches. Under this name he is reckoned by various demonologists as: thechief of the minor demons (those attending sabbats presumably) and the Inspector General of BlackMagic and Sorcery. He is said to have had three horns and the ears of a fox. Witches saluted him byexposing their buttocks while holding in their hands a green candle.Two plates from the Grand Grimoire and Red Dragon cycle illustrate a treasure bearing demonwith three horns; one of these portraits has the signature of Lucifuge Rofocale beneath. This identifiesLeonard and Lucifuge; conflating – with good reason – the lore of the Sabbat with the sorcery of thelate grimoires. The inquisitorial accusation that witches made pacts precedes the plain rendition ofthe process in the later grimoires (a rendition preceded by the more covert Book of Spirits, which asseen is a comprehensive pact). Indeed, as has been established, the concept of the pact reaches backto the magicians of antiquity; be they the sorcerers of the PGM seeking a magical assistant, or theTheurgists with their covenants. While a staple of theological opposition to magic, the conceptionoriginates in magic of the synthesis period if not before.Baal-berith was originally a male god of the Canaanites, the term berith means covenant, or pact.Scholars are undecided whether the covenant concerned was a political alliance or a religiouscovenant between god and worshippers. (It is likely that Baalberith is the demon named Berith in theGoS. There are some pertinent remarks regarding this spirit in Geosophia I.1: Implications forModern Practice). In Baal-Berith’s attribution to Cancer the Chiromancia Astrologíca may be displaying coverterudition. There are some remarkable associations involved here, namely the ancient association ofSirius with zero Cancer, the northern Solstice point that defines the northern station and its Queen. InKimbanda Baalberith is associated with important Pomba Giras. One important association is PombaGira Sete Maridos:Pomba Gira Sete Maridos (Seven Husbands) is an alternative name for Pomba Gira SetePorteiras [seven doors] ... we cannot know which door she will open, or what husband shewill send out, to effectuate her work.Frisvold, Pomba Gira & the Quimbanda of Mbùmba nzilaThe seven husbands theme was encountered when examining the lore associated with Asmodeus;elsewhere the husband of Lilith &c. There are great mysteries of the Mairoal and of Exu Pomba Girahere. Asmodeus – as Typhon – is also the male personification of the seven stars of Ursa Major. Wewould expect a goddess in this role too, and the PGM do not disappoint. Hecate-Artemis isassociated with the Bear constellation repeatedly in the papyri.Another important Pomba Gira associated with Baalberith is Pomba Gira Rosa Caveira:Pomba Gira Rosa Caveira is said to have a double face.

The text underlines that Leonard rules the Sabbat,and Baalberith dreams. This may argue for employing one or other as intermediary spirits in differentkinds of magical work.Baalberith and the 24 additional elementals appear in the section entitled ‘On the Influences of theStars,’ suggesting an astrological component, as compared with Sabbatic rites at the points of theyear. The astrological associations of the spirits, although not terribly reliable, are powerfullyreminiscent of the decans. The catalogue as a whole resembles the Testament of Solomon and islikely inspired by it.The association of the Kings with Sabbats, involving witches, demons and folkloric figurescavorting in dream like gatherings, is not an invention of our anonymous author.

These are not disparate and unconnected but on the contrary closely related. The WildHunt derives from Germanic traditions dating back at least to the Classical era that endured forcenturies into modern folklore. A far greater antiquity – in traditions of the megalithic era – is notunlikely. While in essence an oral tradition it has subsequently absorbed other elements, includingclassical lore at an early stage and later literary magic via Agrippa and others. It has also spread farbeyond its Germanic home, being known in Galicia, Scandinavia, throughout the British Isles (by1127) and elsewhere.The theme includes certain important elements which must be highlighted for comprehension bythose to whom the motif is unfamiliar. Firstly the hunt is as often a phantom army, who on occasionparticipate in ghost battles. Other names for the hunt thus include the Furious Horde. Secondly thehunt or army has a principal leader, frequently identified in Germanic cum Scandinavian lore aseither the Germanic god Wotan or goddess Freya. Other goddess names are associated with the WildHunt, the Diana of the witches among them; Holda should also be mentioned. Some associations linkthis goddess to the Sibylia motif explored elsewhere. She is a goddess of spinning and childbirth,connecting her with the Fates, of whom the three sisters appearing in Sibylia spells are forms (fey andfata are etymologically linked).Actual enactment of the hunt by pagans is known from Roman times, and disapproval of thisappears to be the basis of belief in the witches’ ride to the Sabbat.Certain wicked women turn themselves round to face the other way behind Satan and, led astrayby hallucinations and figments of their imaginations created by evil spirits, believe andmaintain that during the hours of night they ride upon certain beasts along with Diana (a goddessof the pagans), or with Herodias and an innumerable host of women, traversing many areas ofthe earth in the silent dead of night; that they obey her commands as though she were theirmistress, and that on specific nights they are called to her service.Canon Episcopi, 906 CEThat a male or female deity was identified equally in this role is worthy of note; Wotan is identifiedwith Hermes by Tacitus, thus underlining that the leader of the hunt is a psychopomp. The Harlequinis a later development of the male leader, and is of course the devil so far as Christian interpretationsare concerned. The hunt was originally composed of slain warriors, although later of the dead ingeneral, of Arthur’s knights or the followers of King Herla (from Harlequin). Subsequently thesewere interpreted as or supplemented by demons and folklore figures associated with them.Scandinavian traditions refer to Woden leading the Wild Hunt over the Milky Way (Woutanes Wec,Woden’s Way). This is important, it points to a linkage of the Wild Hunt to the stellar eschatologyoutlined in Geosophia.

The frequent confusion ofrole and identity between Southern and Eastern kings springs from the relations of the older traditionwith Greco-Chaldean astrology. A similar wavering of the boundaries for her (originally the Northernsenior queen) may explain this title.This is scarcely to be wondered at; the North/South axis or solstice line is emphasised by megalithicsacred sites in Europe and beyond. Its importance far precedes the Aries point emphasis whichestablished the younger royals. The claims of the older royals were too well established to preventblurring between the old and new regimes; whose male/female pairs provide one form of thequaternary. So too, Woden’s classical association with Hermes (god of Wednesday, Woden’s day) inmodern terms readily links him to the East; but in primeval symbolism it is the East of the solsticesunrise (the North/South stellar axis), rather than of Spring (Aries).NORTH/SOUTHAXISEGYPTIANFORMGERMANICFORMYOUNGERROYALSCapricorn(Gate of the Gods)Headless OneWodenOriens/Baal(Lucifer)Cancer(Gate of Men)SothisHolda(Diana)SibyliaIn any case, by medieval times the Wild Hunt theme was well established throughout Western Europeand undergoing various transformations or developments. One of these in particular concerns us, andevolves out of the expression of the theme embodied by ghostly battles. These plainly require twoarmies, and in the sources the leader of one army is plainly the old psychopompic god, while thesecond army is often – though not invariably – led by four kings. Since this latter development is ofsuch interest it is useful to enlarge upon it.As early as the 13th century William of Auvergne wrote about night battles and ghost armies; hementions Abundia (the witch goddess Habondia) aka Satia as a leader. This plainly identifies theSabbat ride and the Wild Hunt with each other. He also mentions four kings, and importantly thatnecromancers are wont to summon these and their followers. He mentions their association with thefour quarters, and specifies that the Eastern king is the chief among them. He even says they take theirnames from the directions they rule (beginning, naturally, with Oriens). Their connection with thedead is unquestionable, and underwritten by the mention of necromancers, notwithstanding how vaguethat term had become in christianised magic and pagan survivals. He nevertheless identifies both thekings and their numberless followers as demons. So too as late as 1544 magicians (or charlatans)operating in Germany claimed to be able to summon the four kings during the Ember days (the longstanding connection between kings and queens with these would require another long digression). Theapproach of these Swabian students involved a magical circle, salt and holy water, herbs, candlesand burning embers (presumably for a censer, but the ember days are of course relevant). In theseaccounts of occult treasure hunting it is possible to see past the motives of such charlatans and theirdupes to older traditions, both Germanic and from the Mystery traditions of antiquity.Niccoli points out that these magical adventurers were exploiting existing folk belief, but also thatAgrippa’s Occult Philosophy – in which he also detects Germanic traditions embedded – had been"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"published in Cologne eleven years previously. This text establishes the Four Kings, Oriens,Amaimon, Paimon and Egin, as more or less standard in subsequent grimoires, although earlierreferences are not scarce. Via Agrippa too, our Kings are firmly identified with rabbinicalequivalents: Samael, Azazel, Azael and Mahazael; though references to these are also much older.Variants of the night battle story pit these literary four kings of the world against the traditional fourkings of the Ember days. This opposition is reminiscent of the battling spirits at Mount Hecla (Scot1655, see also Geo II ‘Volcanic Conjurations’); this latter also illustrates widespread interaction ofAgrippa and folklore themes. While the battles place the Kings in opposition, there is as muchmerging of the literary and folkloric Kings.

Therole of the four elemental rulers involved is identical to that of the Four Kings in German andFranco-Italian derived texts: Bael, Paimon, Amaymon and Ariton. Those names given, Nicksa, Ghob,Paralda, Djin are more recent artificial names, derived from types. That is, Nicksa derives fromNixies, who are water spirits; Ghob or Gob derives from goblins, creatures of the earth. Djin derivesfrom Genies, while imitating the Arab djin (also a plural), which are fiery ifrits. Only Paralda, rulerof air, has no obvious etymology of this kind. Neither I nor Joseph Peterson can find any reference tothese names preceding Eliphas Lévi. He likely composed three out of four of the Elemental Prayersbesides. An older but equally synthetic angelic equivalent is the supposed elemental angels. Theirnames, Ar(i) al, Seraph, Tharsis and Kerub, are in every case derived from the names of angelicchoirs: Aralim, Seraphim, Tharsishim and Kerubim, all plurals. Lévi may have taken this as anexample when composing his names.Before examining the lower hierarchy of the grimoire, a brief discussion on the place of elementalsin grimoire magic is in order."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"TElementalsHERE ARE NO MORE FITTING WORDS to introduce this topic than those of the splendidly titled workof Paracelsus: Liber de nymphis, Sylphis, Pygmæis et Salamandris et de cæteris spiritibus(The Book of the nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies and Salamanders and the other spirits):Know, therefore, that the purpose of this book is to describe the four kinds of spirit-men, namely,the water people, the mountain people, the fire people and the wind people. Included among thesefour kinds are the giants, the melusines, the Venusberg and what is similar to them.Before turning to the individual spirits and their subjects as described in Chiromancia Astrologícawe need to have a clear view of the grimoires and their spirits. This is still obscured by the modernangels and demons stereotype. It is useful therefore to appeal to a classic of the grimoire genre inopening these remarks. Namely the notorious Fourth Book attributed to Cornelius Agrippa.There is another kind of Spirits, which we have spoken of in our third book of OccultPhilosophy, not so hurtful, and nearest unto men; so also, that they are effected with humanpassions, and do joy in the conversation of men, and freely do inhabit with them: and others dodwell in the Woods and Deserts: & others delight in the company of divers domestic Animals andwild Beasts; and othersome do inhabit about Fountains and Meadows. Whoso-ever thereforewould call up these kinds of Spirits, in the place where they abide, it ought to be done withodoriferous perfumes, and with sweet sounds and instruments of Music, specially composed forthe business, with using of Songs, Enchantments and pleasant Verses, with praises and promises.But those which are obstinate to yield to these things, are to be compelled with Threatenings,Comminations, Cursings, Delusions, Contumelies, and especially by threatening to expel themfrom those places where they are conversant.Further, if need be, thou mayest betake thee to use Exorcisms; but the chiefest thing that ought tobe observed, is, constancy of mind, and boldness, free, and alienated from fear.Lastly, when you would invocate these kinds of Spirits, you ought to prepare a Table in theplace of invocation, covered with clean linen; whereupon you shall set new bread, and runningwater or milk in new earthen vessels, and new knives. And you shall make a fire, whereupon aperfume shall be made. But let the Invocant go unto the head of the Table, and round about it letthere be seats placed for the Spirits, as you please; and the Spirits being called, you shall invitethem to drink and eat. But if perchance you shall fear an evil Spirit, then draw a Circle about it,and let that part of the Table at which the Invocant sits, be within the Circle, and the rest of theTable without the Circle.Agrippa (attrib.): The Fourth Book of Occult PhilosophyIn the Fourth Book the passage quoted above bears the heading ‘Other kinds of spirits.’ It is precededby an account of dealing with the more familiar evil spirits. It is these that people too readilyconsider first, when faced with any species in the grimoire literature other than angels. Tellingly ourpresent passage is also succeeded by yet another passage, relating the manner of working with thedead. It is however with the others mentioned above that this section of our study deals. In"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"conventional terminology these are often referred to by the Paracelsian term, elementals. Certainlythis great figure of traditional occultism coined the terms undines, sylphs, gnomes and salamanders.The tendency to associate them with archaic nature spirits and to various species of fairy folk hasbeen considered a later development. In fact, under the influence of Platonism and Christianangelology, the grimoires were no less involved with these prior to Paracelsus (1493–1541). We candetect the same idea much earlier, in a Neoplatonist tradition embracing Iamblichus, Origen, Psuedo-Dionysus and others. In Christian terms, while many pagan figures could be demonised, angelologyprovided another route. The lesser figures of Pagan mythology, these same spirits of meadows, treesand streams, belonged to the third great division of angelic beings, after the super-celestial andplanetary:The third dispose every smaller matter, and to each thing each one is a preserver. There are alsoof these, who afford vertue to the least plants and stones and to all inferior things; to whom manythings are common with God, many with men, and they are mediating Ministers.His previous chapter shows clearly that Agrippa identified these utterly with our elementals, and wesee the source ideas of the Fourth Book in this same chapter:... whence as these Angels are appointed for diverse Stars, so also [others] for diverse placesand times, not that they are limited by time or place, neither by the bodies which they areappointed to govern, but because the order of wisdom hath so decreed, therefore they favor more,and patronize those bodies, places, times, stars; so they have called some Diurnall, someNocturnall, other Meridionall; in like manner some are called Wood-men, some Mountaineers,some Fieldmen, some Domesticks. Hence the gods of the Woods, Country gods, Satyrs, familiars,Fairies of the fountains, Fairies of the Woods, Nymphs of the Sea, the Naiades, Neriades,Dryades, Pierides, Hamadryades, Potumides, Hinnides, Agapte, Pales, Pareades, Dodonæ,Feniliæ, Lavernæ, Pareæ, Muses, Aonides, Castalides, Heliconides, Pegasides, Meonides,Phebiades, Camenæ, the Graces, the Genii, Hobgoblins, and such like; whence they call themvulgar superiors, some the demi-gods [demigods] and goddesses; some of these are so familiarand acquainted with men, that they are even affected with humane perturbations, by whoseinstruction Plato thinketh that men do oftentimes wonderfull things.This identification of nature spirits with a third angelic Order (each Order is – of course – sub-divided) was not universally adopted. The demonisation of all spirits was not uncommon; inElizabethan England many – not all – believed the denizens of the fairy realm and hell to be identical.The importance of Paracelsus as also the Comte de Gabalis, is the alternative they provide to thisview of spirits. This alternative is as much at home in the grimoire tradition as the more cut and dried‘they’re all angels or demons.’ This less dualistic and polarised influence is plain in the LansdowneKey of Solomon. There the Four Kings known from both the Goetia and Agrippa’s tables are linkedwith the four elemental races of Paracelsus, both in tabular form and among the ritual instructions."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"SComte de GabalisINCE IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1670, the influence of the Comte de Gabalis on magical literatureincluding the grimoires has been immense and direct. A particularly salient example is thePrayer of the Salamanders in Discourse V. This prayer originates in a fragment of Porphyry’swork on the Chaldean Oracles. From Gabalis it found its way into the Grimorium Verum, and – withthree other elemental prayers – into the works of Eliphas Lévi and onwards to the Golden Dawn.Lévi’s view of elementals, and the ritual context in which these prayers are embedded, reflectsMartinist influence. Implicit is a view of the Universe and its destiny that includes the redemptioneven of fallen spirits; a doctrine attributed to Origen and known as restitutionism.So too, besides the printed Bibliothèque Bleue grimoires, we can perhaps detect the influence ofthe Comte de Gabalis in the manuscript grimoires. Lansdowne 1203, an important form of the Key ofSolomon, patently views many grimoire spirits as elementals rather than accursed demons. It makesthe Four Kings of the Goetia of Solomon the rulers of the Paracelsian elementals, rather than of evilspirits. This is further underlined by blaming the avarice of men rather than the malice of spirits forthe dangers attending occult treasure hunting (see also The True Grimoire and Geosophia). There isno difficulty attributing such an influence to this branch of the Solomonic family. Lansdowne 1203 islater than Gabalis, which was a virtual holy book of Rosicrucians of the time.The motivations of the author of the Comte de Gabalis can only be guessed at. They were verylikely polemical and revelatory, while nevertheless covert and disguised. While apparently asatirical novel there is no doubt whatever that the Comte represents very real doctrines and ideas.The very name Gabalis is a Paracelsian term for prophecy. It is, in a sense, a master key to theWestern occult tradition in a particularly important formative phase directly preceding our presentera. As such it is deserving of close attention and scrutiny. It is indispensable to those researching andpracticing grimoire magic; still more so to all seeking less negative and polarised views of spiritswithin general Western magical practice.Turning now to the spirits named in Chiromancia Astrologíca, there is a truly immense fund offolklore material contained and alluded to in this section. As will be apparent, this materialexemplifies in great detail the type of spirits described in the Fourth Book.

Although a devil, it is a benefic star.The inspiration of the demonology of Chiromancia Astrologíca is varied and includes the works ofEliphas Lévi and of Sir Walter Scott. Bear in mind that the roots of this grimoire are Iberian and thatthis text was published in Mexico. Owen Davies’ remarks on grimoires as vehicles of culturalexchange are more than apt here.1 FatuaA name of a female spirit, also named Fauna, associated with the Roman god Faunus as wife,spouse, sister or daughter. Thus we may see in her a female spirit of the woodlands who verypossibly possesses prophetic powers.2 MelusineMelusine (or Melusina) is a famous figure in European folklore, a female spirit of fresh watersin sacred springs and rivers. She is usually depicted as a woman who is a serpent or fish fromthe waist down (much like a mermaid). She is also sometimes illustrated with wings, two tailsor both, and sometimes referred to as nixie or Neck. In Paracelsian terms she is an undine, andas an individual rather than a type is the queen of these spirits; identical with Nicksa. Her namederives from the same roots as Melissa. Her antecedents and roles in Cretan mystery cults, as anecromantic spirit and Underworld queen equivalent to Persephone, were explored inGeosophia.As Melusine she also has some interesting medieval connections with noble bloodlines,including the Merovingian kings. It is related also that Richard Cœur de Lion of England oftenrepeated a story that his ancestor the Countess of Anjou was in fact the fairy Melu-sine. Fromthis fondness came the common term for his family as the devil’s brood; since in his words theycame from the devil and would return to the devil. It is worth noting in passing how a femalefigure could be synonymous with a male devil. These regal and diabolic associations areentirely appropriate to Melusine, in addition to their wider relevance to the themes in this study.One German tale of Melusine worth relating was translated into English around 1500 andbecame widely known. An Albanian king went hunting and met a beautiful woman in the forest:Pressyne, mother of Melusine. She agreed to marry him provided he did not enter her chamberwhen she gave birth to or bathed her children. Upon marrying him she later gave birth to triplets,all female. When King Elynas broke the promise she left the kingdom taking these daughters tothe lost Isle of Avalon. This is variously identified with Glastonbury, or more likely Bath (AquaSulis, the site of a famous hot spring and its pre-Roman goddess). Her daughters’ names wereMelusine, Melior, and Palatyne and they were raised in Avalon until their fifteenth birthday. Atthis time Melusine extracted the story of their coming thence from her mother. On learning of hisbreaking his oath she and her sisters abducted and imprisoned Elynas. When their motherlearned of this she punished them for mistreating her husband. Melusine’s punishment includedtransformation, from the waist down she resembled a serpent, or in other versions, takes theshape of a mermaid.Martin Luther was prolifically articulate regarding one form of Melusine, the Melusina ofLucelberg in Silesia, who he identified as a succubus. So too the Comte de Gabalis refers us tothe works of the great Paracelsus, who affirms in five or six different places that nothing ismore certain than the fact that this same Melusina was a nymph. This happens to be quite true;"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Gabalis is above all a good Paracelsian. At least five references appear in the famous work ofParacelsus: Liber de nymphis, Sylphis, Pygmaeis et Salamandris et de cæteris spiritibus.Paracelsus’ work is of course seminal to the entire post-classical literature of elementals. Acareful perusal will reveal the frequent association of elementals with older mythology, fairylore and pagan survivals to be entirely orthodox. The assertion occasionally encountered, thatthis equating of types applies fairly well with the exception of the much misunderstood sylphs(sylvestres) is in my eyes entirely wrong. The hardening of an over emphasised dividing linebetween literary occultism and folklore is largely to blame for the errors in this respect. Anotherproblem arises when looking for connections with the four states of matter, in which airrepresents gases or the higher atmosphere; this, it is true, does not much connect with folklore.However, sylphs’ relation to the air is not of this kind. European sylphs are best understood inrelation to trees; in which the wind blows, and wherein ghosts and spirits congregate andmanifest in breezes.The interplay between aerial and watery modes present with such spirits and their queens is alsorelevant. In European lore and particularly its interpretation, aerial associations are often literallysubmerged beneath watery ones.Sir Walter Scott told a Melusine tale in The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1802–1803),confident that:The reader will find the fairy of Normandy, or Bretagne, adorned with all the splendour ofEastern description. The fairy Melusina, also, who married Guy de Lusignan, Count of Poitou,under condition that he should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy, was of this latter class.She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art.Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, byconcealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusinadiscovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with aloud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even in the days ofBrantome, she was supposed to be the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing asshe sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the castle of Lusignan the night before it wasdemolished.This wailing also explains the Czech and Slovak term meluzin describing a noisy wind, often in thechimney. It derives from tales of her seeking her lost children. This connection with the wind as wellas with water is worthy of our attention, as well as that of folklorists. Consider that both Cyprian andEmpedocles attribute female rulers to Water and Air. The Lamia type, so strong a presence in ourmagical traditions, whether in recent or archaic forms, is most readily associated with the element ofwater. Nevertheless, Melusine, a foremost example of this very type, has an undeniable facility tomove from water to air. What is more, Melusine shares this characteristic with the widespread andwell documented Slavic Rusalka, of whom more anon.3 DuendeDuende are directly from Iberian folklore, and appear frequently in Latin American and Filipinocontexts. There are regional variants, but also analogues with Scandinavian tomte or nisse and theBritish brownie. The etymology of tomte also connects with that of duende: Swedish tomte from tomt,home. and the Spanish dueño, owner or householder. There are similarities too with the kobold."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"As with other figures there are aspects which are charming and good natured, and others which arethreatening. Thus Portuguese folklore uses the term for goblin-like beings prone to causing girls tolose their way in the woods. Other forms describe them as helpers of those lost in the forest. InBelize, duende are called Tata Duende, they live in the forest and lack thumbs, perhaps connectingwith the four fingered tomte.In Hispanic folklore in Meso-America and the southwest United States, duendes resemble gnomesand live in the walls of homes. Again suggesting tomte connections, they reside in the bedroom wallsof children’s rooms. Their relation with children is generally benevolent but misbehaviour oruntidiness can have unfortunate results. They might clip an untidy child’s toenails, with occasionalaccidental amputations of the toe. They may watch children playing ball in their bedrooms afterbedtime, and then appear and frighten them. They can steal from children, which may imply suitableofferings, or even eat them after coming to some arrangement with their mother! In the Philippinesbeliefs associate them with children, who they might play with. Their abodes are rocks and caves,also old trees, and dark or neglected areas of the home. The tomte connection recurs here also, onlyrather than burial mounds they are associated with ant hills. Then they are called nuno sa punso – theold man of the mound. This Filipino duende can be good or evil, which type can be ascertained bytheir colour, white or black.4 SalvaniaCompare Sylvanus, Roman god of fields, forests and flocks. Note however that Paracelsus uses theterm sylvestres to represent aerial spirits (sylphs). Nor is there any mistaking the identity inParacelsian thought of the sylphs or sylvestres and ancient forest nymphs (dryads, hamadryads &c.).On nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies and Salamanders is quite explicit: the forest people, that is, the airpeople ...Although later generations of occultists mistake tree spirits for earth elementals the plain connectionis between trees and the air. This is more than reminiscent of Greek ideas, where the spirits of thedead gather in the branches of trees. Traditions regarding the spirits of the air are complex, withChristian demonologists viewing them as fallen angels; in the late Hellenic period they were dividedinto two layers, those dwelling closest to the Moon being helpful ministers, and those closest to theearth being nearer to our conception of evil spirits. The concept of third order angels brings benignspirits down to earth; in contradiction of other Christian opinions, but common in many occultsources.5 DexgarPossibly from the Catalan or Portuguese deixar, abandoned.6 DeoinehiaDeoinehia’s meaning is uncertain. It may derive from Dionæa, a name of Aphrodite’s mother, orindeed the goddess herself. Dione was likely the bride of Zeus prior to Hera’s ascendancy, andworshipped with him at Dodona. A still more similar form of the name appears in the Latin name ofthe Venus flytrap and other things belonging to her. Alternatively it may derive from Diana (itself aform of Dione, as former mother of the gods) and refer to the Asturian xana.The xana is a folklore figure known in the New World besides her native Asturias. The name of theSpanish xana is thought by some to derive from Diana, who was associated with streams and withnymphs. A xana has the form of a mortal woman whose appearance differs according to her nature,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"whether benign or malicious. The stories about her are varied. The benign xanas have the appearanceof a small but beautiful woman, but is an immortal water nymph associated with pure water, be itwaterfalls, streams or rivers, and particularly in forests. She has long blonde or light coloured hair,often curly, and fair skin. In this role she typically combs her hair like a mermaid. In this form hergifts include water for thirsty travellers, or treasures of gold or silver to the worthy, or indeed herlove. In malicious roles she is again small, but also thin (implying the fair xana is more voluptuous)and dark coloured. Malicious xanas can turn into animals; enter homes through the keyhole; abductand enchant people. Intriguingly the dark xana also has a gift giving form, being the bestower of amagical belt. This resembles the handkerchiefs given by the Greek Kalē, essentially the token of apact.Another mysterious aspect of the xana cycle of myth is that she may herself be suffering from anenchantment, which can only be broken if its secret is divined. Many xanas are stealers of children,usually substituting her own. As with Lamia this is not necessarily her own fault and does not applyonly to malicious xanas. Rather it is due to her inability to raise her own children, this ‘curse’ mayconnect with the enchanted condition some xanas suffer from.Xanas who possess a treasure may bestow it upon those they encounter, depending on somemysterious mode of judgement. The occasions on which they do are rarer than the converse. So toothe xanas sing with a haunting and hypnotic voice, with very different effects depending whether thehearer is pure or impure of nature. Both may suggest an eschatological subtext, as we saw with thesirens in Geosophia. So too her dual nature along with much else about her has very ancientprecedent, reminding us that her name may derive from Diana.7 Deer FootPossibly there is also an Iberian figure I have overlooked but perhaps the intended figure here is theDeer Woman or Deer Lady of Native American mythology. As part of our theme is crossovers ofEuropean and New World traditions, her presence here is entirely apt. Deer Woman is a shape shifterin Native American myth, appearing variously in the form of an old woman, a young maiden, or adeer. Sometimes she is half woman, half deer, but more often it is her feet alone which betray her realnature. When luring men to her she hides her feet in various ways, standing behind shrubs or a littleoff the path. Her eyes too are those of a hind. She slays by stomping the victim to death with heranimal feet.There are resemblances to folklore figures from other parts of the Americas, as well as to theSpanish xana. These include the Lamia-like La Llorona in Mexico, Puerto Rica and Meso-America, aslayer of children, with a fascinating background. The Chilean Fiura is hideous and has foul breath,despite which she is a seductress who drives her lovers insane when she is done. Significantly hermale counterpart Trauco, a virile hypnotiser of mortal women, has no feet. The South AmericanPatasola – whose name means One Foot – appears to lonely hunters and loggers in the jungle. Shelures them by resemblance to a loved one or a beautiful woman, but devours them in her true hideousand one-footed form, consuming both their flesh and their blood. Such figures are often regarded asprotectors of animals and the forest. The Tunda is very similar, known in the Colombian Pacificregion, and especially in the Afro-American community.

Tellingly, given the influencesthroughout this section, it is also known in Anglo-Scottish ballads as Elfhame or similar.10 SvvartProbably Swart, from Norse and Old German for dark, and referring to the Dark Elves, who despitebeing more familiar from modern fantasy fiction are a genuine aspect of Nordic folklore.11 HodekenHodeken is the name of a particular kobold, household spirit of the palace of the Bishop ofHaldenstein. His name refers to his hat, which hung over his face (Hoodikin). He was good and kind,informing the Bishop of future events and keeping the watchmen from sleeping on duty. He had thetypical temper of such spirits when insulted or injured. A kitchen servant who habitually threw filth athim was strangled, chopped up and cooked. The cook, who abused him for this, was thrown in themoat. Reluctantly the Bishop was obliged to exorcise the guardian of his house.12 FolletFollet by itself indicates a Catalan goblin. Alternatively, in the term foc follet, it derives from foc(fire) and follet (crazy), which is also Catalan derived lore. Similarly, Feux Follets in Frenchfolklore, whether in France or French Canada means Merry Fires, actually hostile spirits of the Willo’ the Wisp type. In such French lore they are understood to be damned spirits. These can be either ofcriminals or of bad Catholics who worked with Satan or the Loup-garou (werewolf).13 TomptogobeDerives from Tomte, Tomtegubbe. Tomte, also known as nisse, are figures of Scandinavian andFinnish folklore. They are generally small, from a few inches to around three feet, and resemble anold man in farmer’s attire. However they are also credited with the powers of invisibility and shapeshifting. The latter power permits them to assume sizes in excess of human, and one eye like aCyclops. There are variations between Danish, Norwegian and other forms. In Norway he can appearwith pointed ears, glowing eyes, covered in hair and having but four fingers per hand. ContemporaryDanish forms are somewhat sweetened, with no beard and wearing grey and red woollen clothing anda red cap. However, even in their dwarf or gnome like forms, they are extremely strong; perfectly"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"capable of dealing roughly with unruly farm hands. These were well advised not to indulge in badlanguage, urinate in farm buildings, or mistreat the little fellow. So too innovations in farm life wereprone to upset him, as like many chthonic entities he is distinctly conservative.They protect a farmer’s home and children, especially during the night. An appropriate offering inexchange for their favour was a bowl of porridge, topped with a knob of butter, especially atChristmas in more recent times. This ensures that they stay with the house, exact no retribution forneglect and continue to work on behalf of the farmer and his family. However they are easilyoffended, and will punish those who annoy them, either with prankish slaps or full scale beatings.They can also bring great misfortune to the farm, by the death of livestock or in other ways ruining thefarmer. It was customary when hot water or other spills occurred in the kitchen to shout a warning tothe guardian spirit dwelling under the floor. This position is interesting and suggestive, as it connectsto hearth lore. The name Tomte originates in tomt, the site of a home, the older lore surrounding themconnects them to the founder of the farm, and associates them with ancestral burial mounds on the site.As a chthonic figure associated with the underworld his bite was poisonous and required a shaman’sassistance to acquire a cure from the spirit world.Nisse is simply a nickname for Nils, a proper name given to such spirits, (compare to RobinGoodfellow and Jack o’Lantern). Among many alternative forms of his name is Haugebonde –meaning mound farmer – and most connect him to either the founding of the farm site or a burialmound, as in an ancestral cult. It is likely significant, given the nature of other entities listed in thisgrimoire, that the tomte’s favourite farm animal was the horse, which he would guard and evengroom. Lastly it is necessary to mention a variant form of the tomte who dwells on ships, serving asimilar protective role and capable of mischief if annoyed.14 GrisuGrisu (Turkish Grizu) refers to firedamp, an explosive gas formed in coal seams. There is a moderncartoon dragon of similar name which may derive from folklore. The subject again would appear tobe mining kobolds of the malevolent variety. Incidentally, coal mining is occasionally said to be toorecent to involve folklore, but this is manifestly not the case.15 KelpieA kelpie is a figure of Celtic folklore haunting rivers and lochs in Scotland and Ireland. A shapeshifter, its real form is that of a horse. Often black, occasionally white, there are other regionalvariations as to colour (green as glass with a black mane and tail). An impressive and powerfulbeast in its horse form, its real nature may be divined from its constantly dripping mane. The use ofthe term Norickar as a proper name in the text likely derives from this, as this title is that of apowerful breed of horse. In human form too the hair can give them away, occasionally weeds in thehair provide similar clues. Also known as a water horse, luring children by offering them rides, thenplunging into the water, is another aspect of their fatal nature. They are said to eat their victimsunderwater, all but the heart or liver. Kelpie is not the only name for the creature and both some of itsnames, and the regions in which they occur, suggest overlap or equivalence to the Germanic nix.16 NicnevinNicnevin is readily identified as a figure of Scottish folklore; the Queen of the Fairies, Nicnevin orNicnevan. Known from at least the 14th century, the name too is from Scots Gaelic and translates thusnik (daughter), and nevin (of the little saint). It has been suggested that this name originates in that of a"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"woman condemned for witchcraft, before passing to the Fairy Queen. On the other hand the name ofthe latter may have been bestowed upon particular witches as an honorific. It is interesting too toconsider the identity of the so-called little saint, and notable that the same word can mean a bone.This important figure bears other names, all of which are interesting, both in conventional etymologyand more creative usage.On the Borders she bears the name Gyre-Carling. Gyre is most likely related to the Norse geri(greedy) or gýgr (ogress). Another Norse word kerling (old woman) supplies both the Scottish andNorthern English carline and carling. She has long possessed the reputation of a Hecate andHabundia and is frequently identified with them in literature. Thus she is a queen of the witches,presiding over the Sabbat; she is also a leader in the ride of fairies, ghosts, witches and variousmythological figures Whether the Wild Hunt or the ride to the Sabbat, the identification is equallyjust. Such figures were identified in the Middle Ages and later with Diana or Herodias. Thedemonologist de Lancre’s all inclusive description of Habondia as Queen of the fairies, witches,harpies, furies; and ghosts of the wicked is thus equally appropriate to Nicnevin. Precisely such aphantasmagoria of her subjects is assembled in this chapter of our grimoire.While the association is irresistible, and even allowing for the Iberian connection supplied by thegrimoire, the etymologies of gira in Pomba Gira and the gyre of Gyre Carline are not apparentlyrelated. Nevertheless, there are powerful affinities between these ladies. These include identificationwith a historical figure associated with magic; each a queen of magicians or spirits – and throughHecate – a common association with road junctions, particularly the three way kind.There is also a sensual side to her, associated with love, as there often is even with the ugliestfolklore witches. Thus one light hearted tradition has her leave Scotland after a romantic dispute,becoming the wife of the Islamic prophet and Queen of the Jews. While satirical this has some echoesof the Sibyl figure explored elsewhere in this study, whose foreign affinities are equally exotic; withSolomon rather than Mohammed supplying the love interest. While she was absent dogs stoppedbarking, reminiscent of the presence of Hecate which causes it. So too, according to this version sheeats the flesh of Christian men. Taken as a whole then, even this humorous depiction of her reflectsthe sensual, but alien and dangerous qualities of the grimoire and folklore Sibyl.There are many literary references: Sir Walter Scott, who is a major literary source for thematerials of this chapter of our grimoire, calls her:... a gigantic and malignant female, the Hecate of this mythology, who rode on the storm andmarshalled the rambling host of wanderers under her grim banner. This hag (in all respects thereverse of the Mab or Titania of the Celtic creed) was called Nicneven in that later systemwhich blended the faith of the Celts and of the Goths on this subject.17 NikaThis indicates without any doubt the Neck or Nixie, from German, Nix. It is tempting to connect thiswith the etymology of Nicnevin too, although such does not appear to be the case. NeverthelessEnglish Nixies include some very unpleasant characters, such as Jenny Greenteeth.Nixies are well known shape-shifting water spirits from the myths and legends of Germanic peoplesthroughout Europe with variants common in the British Isles. Often assuming human form, particularlyin recent times there are important exceptions such as the British Knucker, a Worm (ie, dragon, as inOrm and Wyrm). Nix, a German usage, is exclusively male while Nixe and Nixie, (German and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Scandinavian), are female, a river mermaid of Germanic folklore. The term appears to derive fromvery early times, being Indo-European in origin. Water monsters, including the hippopotamus, can beindicated by very similar terms in several languages. The Scandinavian type can assume horse form,resembling the Scottish kelpie (see 15 above). They are shape-shifters, more recent accountscrediting them with human form, with or without clothes depending on the sensibilities of the time.Judging from the older names and lore the horse form appears to be the most ancient and typicaloriginally. Like the kobold they can also disguise themselves as objects, including treasure in thewater.Male spirits of this type in Scandinavia played the violin to lure women and children to death bydrowning. Not all were malevolent however; alternative stories speak of them simply as playingpleasing music attractive to all, men, women and children. As a male equivalent of the Melusine, itwas not uncommon for these types to marry human women. Generally these stories end with the Nixreturning to their watery home, and without access to a brook, waterfall or stream they generallybecome unhappy. These musical spirits can instruct human musicians, rendering them so skilful as toenchant trees and waterfalls, causing the former to dance and the latter to stop to listen. An offeringcould be made, variously or together: three drops of blood, a black creature, vodka or Swedish snuff,to induce them to teach.The times of greatest activity may be revealing, there is again the connection with Christmas andMidsummer (Saint John’s Eve?). Thursdays are also associated with him. Some of these traditionsmay be recent, and are not typical of all local variants.18 AmadriaThe name Amadria presents few problems, since the Italian amadriada or amadriade signify ahamadryad or tree nymph.19 OldnickObviously from Old Nick, a popular and light hearted British nickname for the Devil from the 17thcentury. The American terms Mister Splitfoot and Old Scratch are near equivalents in tone andmeaning. The derivation is unknown but there is a plausible connection to German and Scandinavianterms for supernatural beings with a nik suffix. A Dutch origin has been suggested, from nikken,meaning the devil, with the Anglo Saxon root noecan, to slay. Interestingly given his maritimeconnections here, it appears that the name first appears among English sailors.20 DobieAlso Dobbie or Dobby comes from English folklore, a house spirit akin to a brownie. They wereshaggy creatures like several of their fellows here, and rather thin. They exhibited kindness to bothservants and children. Various household tasks were performed by them. While several of theirrelatives have ambivalent reputations, this description belies the sinister character given in thegrimoire. As with Puck and Robin Goodfellow, giving him new clothes would cause him to ceasework and leave.21 Galdakrina or StrigaThe reliance of this catalogue of sabbatic attendees upon Scott is very clear here. Galdakrin is a malemagician of Scandinavian saga, whom Scott mistakes for a witch; both the term striga and feminisingthe name as Galdakrina occur in his account."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"22 GeiradaAgain our grimoirist is relying on Scott, whose account of a dispute between Norse witches is worthquoting:There is a remarkable story in the Eyrbiggia Saga, giving the result of such a controversy betweentwo of these gifted women, one of whom was determined on discovering and putting to death theson of the other, named Katla, who in a brawl had cut off the hand of the daughter-in-law ofGeirada. A party detached to avenge this wrong, by putting Oddo to death, returned deceived bythe skill of his mother. They had found only Katla, they said, spinning flax from a large distaff.Fools, said Geirada, that distaff was the man you sought. They returned, seized the distaff, andburnt it. But this second time, the witch disguised her son under the appearance of a tame kid. Athird time he was a hog, which grovelled among the ashes. The party returned yet again;augmented, as one of Katla’s maidens who kept watch informed her mistress, by one in a bluemantle. Alas! said Katla, it is the sorceress Geirada, against whom spells avail not.Accordingly, the hostile party, entering for the fourth time, seized on the object of their animosity,and put him to death.23 Master HoemmerlingAn underground spirit in the mining town of Annaberg killed over a dozen miners there, apparentlywith his breath (see 14 above). In local folklore he bore the name Master Hoemmerling, andappeared as a giant covered by a black hood and known therefore as the Monk of the Mountain.24 PuckPuck, while best known for his sentimentalised role in Shakespeare’s Midsummer night’s Dream isfar more ancient. The name occurs in both Celtic and Germanic languages, signifying a demon, goblinor dangerous fairy. In English folklore all these are present and Puck is near identical with RobinGoodfellow. Related variant forms are found throughout the British Isles (Welsh Pwca, Irish Phouka,Pooka or Puca). Old English, Scandinavian, Germanic and other languages contain similar forms. InMiddle English Pouk signified the same. Elizabethan and medieval forms are distinctly sinister,notwithstanding the modern fairy guise. Nevertheless the horns and other attributes of Pan arecommon enough in earlier times. His conferring an ass’s head on Bottom the Weaver in Shakespeareis curious, since this was an attribute of his own. He could also take the entire form of either ass orhorse. As has been seen, shape shifters in horse form are a very prominent theme throughout thissection. Other forms include a hairy man, an eagle and an aged man.Like a will o’ the wisp he could lead travellers astray and into danger. Getting lost could bedescribed as being with Robin Goodfellow in the medieval period. Not only is his name synonymouswith the type of fairy creature termed a goblin, but Hob, as in Hobgoblin, is a medieval nickname ofRobin or Robert.The medieval reputation continues in later periods. The nature of fairies in Elizabethan lore was ofcourse ambivalent; they could be seen either as helpful brownie or evil demon. The Puritans held thelatter view; Hobgoblins and Robin Goodfellows were devils. The author Robert Burton names asterrestrial devils many such spirits, including virtually the entire cast of my ‘Familiar and UnfamiliarSpirits’: Lares, Genii, Fauns, Satyrs, Wood nymphs, Foliots, Fairies, Robin Goodfellows etc.Nevertheless there are resemblances to the tomte and brownie in the lore surrounding both Pookasand Robin Goodfellow (or plural Robin Goodfellows).

The old custom of burying horse skulls to protect new buildingsmay well involve some connection with such beings."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"HOF KINGS AND QUEENSERE FOLLOWS ADDITIONAL MATERIAL from El Libro Magno de San Cipriano which extends thecorrespondences given earlier. These conform to the four elemental rulers as identical withthe Four Kings, Oriens, Amaymon, Paymon and Ariton, in other grimoires. To assist thedovetailing, Belzebuth may be seen as embodying in one person the power of the Infernal Trinity(much as the Maioral does in Kimbanda, by one reading). The presence of Leonard in these textsunderlines my identification of the rank and file spirits of Chiromancia Astrologíca with the demonsattending the Sabbat and the Wild Hunt. I have interspersed the material with my own comments, andadded the appropriate headings from the Heptameron.As there exist seven Celestial spirits [the Olympic spirits are named in both texts in this role]as sponsors of all works of beneficial magic, there exist six Infernal princes who are patrons ofthe wonders of the malfeasant Magic.

They disagree as to their temperament, Lansdownehaving a more positive view of the spirits in line with the Comte de Gabalis.

Indeed the Nordic Cyprian in Clavis Inferni iscentred on the conventional Four Kings; which is by no means the only parallel in thedemonology of these traditions, united by the figure of Cyprian. The gender of the elemental rulers isworth some attention. In our Iberian sources Djin and Ghob are male, Paralda and Nicksa female.This is not attributable to the likely inventor of these names, Eliphas Lévi.

Interms of Hermetic astrology, with its emphasis on the decans, it can be understood as aninterplay – even rivalry – between the old queen Sothis, and the young queen Libra. That is,mechanistically speaking, echoes of the old Egyptian order within the new Chaldean status quo.However, the ancient synthesis is rooted in mythological language, and the ‘rightness’ of this themereaches beyond astrology.An important example of the ubiquitous nature of this dual affinity is the subject of our next tangent.In essence a rusalka (plural rusalki, rusalky) is a Slavic form of the undine, variously identified asnymphs, succubi and female ghosts. Their usual shape is human, while mermaid-like forms arecommon; they share many features with the Melusine. During the night they leave the water, eitherdancing in meadows – a recollection of old rites – or ascending a tree beside their watery home.They are, as is usual, often predatory; enticing men with their songs and dancing before leading themto death by drowning. As with the lamia and other such types, these circumstances connect the rusalkawith archaic goddesses; representing both accepted female roles and dangerous exceptions.Among the etymological connections of rusalka is rosalia, a term for Whitsun dances by younggirls, entering Slavonic languages via Greek from the Latin. In Classical use Rosalia, or Rosaria,were a type of floral festival of which the most common involved the dead. Bulgarian rusalki alsohave a plant hypostasis, dittany, while wormwood protects from them. The connection with femaleghosts places these spirits firmly in the category of lamia and other similar types of ancient origin.This is reinforced by the circumstances of the typical rusalka ghost – lovelorn suicides or pregnantunmarried women. The death is supposed to have occurred in or near the water. These spirits may beput to rest if their death is avenged.Among beliefs concerning the ghostly type is an association of rusalki with spirits of children whoeither died before baptism, or were drowned unbaptised by their unmarried mothers. These ghostlychildren are called navky. The navky wander the fields and woods seeking baptism for their souls.They can be malevolent however, in common with ideas about child ghosts in the papyri &c. If afterseven years of wandering they have not found baptism – which may be given by a simple verbalformula – they join the ranks of the rusalki. The necromantic and eschatological connections of theseideas are clear enough.There is a curious interplay of elements in the nature of rusalki, which is related to time. Rusalkiare known throughout the Slavic world, and there are regional variations, some fairly minor, othersmore important. In countries of elemental extremes, rusalki abide in the water during the cold months,and in the summer take up their habitations in and among trees and in meadows. In other forms of thetheme, they usually occupy water by day, but at night or at other times they as frequently leave it. This"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"is in order to perform typical mermaid roles like combing their hair beside water, but also to ascendtrees to sing, or to join other rusalki in meadows for circle dances. In Belarus their wateryassociations are absent; they are wholly associated with trees and fields, sylphs rather than undines.In other forms her hair must always be wet, and she cannot survive long out of water, but her comb isa talisman that conjures water.These two extremes are balanced in the majority of cases; thus, illustrative of the nature of ourQueens, she moves between air and water."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"FWThe Queens of the GrimoiresINDING A CLUE TO THE NATURE of our spirit queens in the rusalka is entirely appropriate. Thesyncretism of Kimbanda associates rusalkis with Pomba Gira Rainha das Almas (Pomba Giraof Souls). This Pomba Gira, who works at the crossroads (Encruzilhada) and in the cemetery(Kalunga Pequena), is a queen (Rainha).In the mythology of the chiefs, as we have seen, Lilith is frequently paired with Asmodeus andrelated figures. So too the Kimbanda precedent of Exu Lucifer’s pairing with Exu Pomba Gira(Klepoth) implies a similar relationship between the Lucifer of the grimoires and Astaroth. Sibylia’sequivalence with Lamia (explored in Geosophia) and with Lilith is also echoed in Kimbanda’ssyncretism. The equivalent of Lamia in Kimbanda is Pomba Gira Maria Quitéria, that of Lamashtu,Pomba Gira Rainha da Kalunga. Lilith’s is Pomba Gira Rainha da Kalunga Pequena, while the nameof Asmodeus in Kimbanda is the male equivalent of hers, Exu Rei da Kalunga Pequena, reprisingLilith’s ancient pairing with him. Together they are the Queen and the King of the Cemetery.The Four Queens in Jewish DemonologyHEN CONSIDERING Asmodeus in relation to the Four Queens in Part Two mention was madeof Agrat bat Mahlat, which means Agrat daughter of Mahlat. Mahlat also appears asMahalath, a wife of Esau, who he apparently renamed from Basemath (sweet-smelling, orbalsam), which is also the name of a daughter of Solomon. Mahalath means sickness, a troop ofdancers or a harp or lute; the term appears in these senses in connection with the Psalms. Accordingto a Kabbalistic tradition, Agrat bat Mahalath bore Asmodeus to King David father of Solomon. InZoharic Kabbalah she is a queen of the demons and wife of Samael in company with Lilith, Naamah,and Eisheth Zenunim. These four are also angels of sacred prostitution, Eisheth also being known asEisheth Qodeshah; qodesh meaning a sacred prostitute. Prostitution in the scriptures is, of course, asynonym for straying from the true faith and following other beliefs.While apt within limits, it is too simple to consider the four as manifestations of Lilith as somemodern authors do; especially given the mother and daughter relations between some of them. As seenearlier, Hayyim Vital’s list of Four Queens gives Mahalath in place of Eisheth. The confusionregarding these identities and their roles is clarified by Rahab, another known substitute for Mahalathin Jewish lore. She is a great angelic power associated with the sea. Gustav Davidson comparesRahab to Kunospaston of the ToS; the attentive reader will draw a similar comparison with Obizuth.Obizuth (marine) and Lilith (aerial) marks a clear line of division between the Jewish demon queens,give or take the capacity of Lamia to move between these elements."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONHE MATTER OF THE CHIEFS AND MONARCHS of the grimoires obviously involves some variation andsome interplay between categories. That the foremost of the four kings is the Eastern spirit is clear.From the Livre des Esperitz it is clear also that the attributes of Scirlin as Intermediary identify himwith Oriens, who has authority over the other Kings and thus their spirits, and may call them together.Hence the sacrifice in the Grimorium Verum is to Scirlin as Prince of the East; not to Jehovah (thesubstance of Psalm 51 in the GV ritual is confirmatory). That several female spirits are related to theWest and to Air is also established, these include Klepoth, Astaroth, Lilith and Paimon; who weshould distinguish but nonetheless associate with one another. That Astaroth of the grimoiresdescends from the late Pagan goddesses Hecate, Ephesian Artemis and Cybele more than earlierbiblical goddesses is – in my eyes – a good point but one which may take time to percolate outwards.Nonetheless, overall the evaluation of the ruling spirits of the grimoire families has been an importantand useful task.It is shown that the Four relate as much to points of the solar cycle, daily and annual, as to thewinds or elements as things in themselves. That solar decans and lunar mansions played a majorformative role in the shaping of grimoire spirit hierarchies is established. The formative influence ofpagan theurgy on shaping magical thought, both pro and anti, is beyond doubt. The implications ofthis, in regard to use of physical materials in magic, and recourse to hermetic god making technology,must impact any serious approach to Solomonic magic. The relation of the demonised pact makingprocess to the theurgic ‘raising up of plants’ also has major implications. The still controversial pactis shown hereby to originate not in accusations against medieval and later witches, heretics andmagicians, but criticism of the Neoplatonist movement in Early Church polemics. The raising up ofplants as a process underpins the manufacture of Hermetic magical rings; a methodology thatminiaturises the drawing of a circle on the ground and the burial within it of magical plants beneath asuitable stone. That all magical acts involve an implicit or explicit pact concerns the magicalassistant theme in the papyri, which is simply distorted in anti-magical propaganda. In this sense toothe later grimoires – where the pact is rescued from dissimulation – represent an authentic goeticrevival.Any dividing line between ceremonial magicians on the one hand, and witches, heretics andsorcerers on the other is largely artificial. Goetia as a historical continuum embraces the witchcraft ofHecate and the Queen of Sheba, along with the grimoires and the practices of itinerant Orphicinitiators in the days of Plato. It is no accident that the spirit catalogue of the Magical Elementsresembles a Sabbat gathering rich in folklore and the Testament of Solomon simultaneously. It is notrequired of it to resemble more genteel stereotypes of high magic; it is justified, authentic andvaluable because it does not.Goetic practice centres on relations with spirits. These relations are obtained via interpersonalpact; by rites incorporating stones, herbs and images, and through mythic context. In short a rituallanguage or Mystery which shares its syntax with the great myths."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"DThe Mythic World of MagicOES BELIEVING GOD TO BE A MYTHICAL BEING equate with atheism?

Indeed they create language and culture, and live withinits fabric as semi-independent parts of a living organism.Ramsey Dukes ModelGiven the power of myths in language and culture, the role of both artist and magician becomesclearer. Myths are not only important; they are active and potentially dangerous or benign forceswithin a culture, or even across cultures. An obvious example of an active and dangerous myth is thealways imminent Middle Eastern Armageddon. This mythical battle features in the foreign policy ofmany nation states, and their defence budgets.In cultural battles enacted in the daily mass media, local champions of science tip their lances atreligion in frequently unedifying spectacle. To complain that religion is unscientific is as idle ascomplaining that science isn’t artistic. In such ill informed company, the observation that magic isn’treligion will also likely fall on deaf ears. The post-modern reality these misguided white knightschampion is supposedly directed by market forces, yet economics is no more scientific than religion.In these times punctuated by ‘bank holydays,’ the new man behind the curtain is the economist. Themyth of progress is a sacred cow, even to doubt is to blaspheme, to utter nonsense; to be ignored.Ignore too that the intellectual tradition employed in populist critique of religion evolved withinChristianity, and rarely steps outside it. Neither magic, let alone other religions, are typicallycomprehended in the discussion.In truth, these are ‘in culture’ turf wars, and the larger cultural landscape consists of more thanscience and religion. Regardless of our tastes and ontological opinions, in the really-real world bothart and magic are as culturally significant, present and active as both science and religion. Thestrength of one limb or other in a given historical period may vary as does the degree of mutualinterdependence, but severing from the body has never been nor will be a viable option.

Myths are active agencies in the world, and the gods are hidden inplain sight in everyday language and events. Their omnipresence extends throughout a worldexpressed by language and grasped by imagination; the real world.It has been argued by Nobel Prize winning biologist Jacques Monod, and supported by thelinguistic theories of Noam Chomsky, that the capacity for language is hardwired; both innate andbiological. The case is that this capacity is crucial to human evolution, and the abstract consciousnessdistinguishing humans from animals. The pivot point, at which the division between proto-hominidand human is crossed, is the ‘primitive’ acquisition of art and ritual. In short spirituality has abiological basis; scientifically it is explained but not explained away. Art, religion, magic andscience are hardwired via human ‘wetware’ into the living matrix of language and culture. The godsare mythical, myth shapes events; atheism does not insulate us from the immortals. Nor does atheism –defined as the belief that N is mythical – exclude animism. Magicians are cultural engineers,regardless of their sphere of operation; they ‘manage myths’ to shape events. Such mythical conceptsas the afterlife or spirit world are their natural and familiar territory. Working relations with spiritsand the development of counter-mythology are rational and productive activities.The Grimoire, the Journey and the MagicianHIS IS THE END of the Encyclopædia Goetica; a comprehensive examination of the subject, asrequired to overturn ‘what everyone knows’ about Goetia. A conclusion to this book, indeed theentire series, requires some kind of statement. Some recapitulation is also in order, to readdressthe intention and how it has been met. Understand first, that in answering a trove of questions thathave waited overlong to be asked, I claim no infallibility. In taking many steps shunned by others,such a claim would be inherently unlikely. It is not by accident however that my map does not leadyou back whence you came, unchanged. It is also not through sins of omission that my methods aredangerous, as I concede them to be. Rather than repeat the safe and comfortable clichés of a thousand‘occult’ pot-boilers, they adventure into unknown territory. Those who are ready for a step in the darkwill require no guarantees, and would be rightly suspicious were they offered.Travelling with the True Grimoire on the Argo of Magic to the triple crossroads of Saint Cyprian, thetraveller is changed. Having let the genie out of the bottle, a little tweaking in the arena of pre-packaged placebo magic isn’t going to put it back in. Goetia is not a subset or perversion of a highermagic. It is itself, and has its own distinct worldview. This could be explained in simple terms, wereit not for the tendency to force fit earth shattering perspective switches to the view points theyexplode. Even hammer blows at the foundations of error are easily misinterpreted or ignored; bythose wary of abandoning their sacred cows, or acknowledging them as such. My method requires notjust a word or a hammer, but both: slogans and koans, theses and manuals, and things beyond words."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"GAll Oracles are ChthonicOETIA HAS NO NECESSARY CONNECTION with revealed religion other than for purposes ofcamouflage or adaptation. Having been robbed previously by theologians and philosophers, itis entitled to steal their new clothes for itself once in a while. Is Hermes not the god ofthieves? In essence however, Goetia differs so fundamentally from revealed religion that reliance onan exterior frame of reference is inadequate and misleading. Similarly, its chthonic rites, dramatispersonæ and mythical worldview are appropriate and implicit, requiring no concessions either withor from modernism.The spiritual authority of the shaman is not bestowed from on high. It is not applied in layers ofgrades and titles, or badges on a Masonic sash. Nor is it the result of a spurious God-given dominionover the natural world on the part of man as a privileged being, the Crown of Creation. These areinversions on the part of later envious orthodoxies. The powers of the shaman are earthly; the marksof attainment are burned fingers and initiation scars. So it is with Goetia. The Gate of the Gods entersthe original home of the gods; not in ‘heaven’ but in the Underworld.The Path of Darkness is not a brief excursion, prior to having a flashlight stuffed up your blindfold,and called Initiation. Nor is this darkness the ooky-spooky world of anti-cosmic poseurs playing atoccultism. It is not an adolescent turning off the light – hand nervously hovering thereafter on theswitch. Both the play acting pseudo-dark and the light – whereby acknowledgement of danger, deathand disease are kept at bay – are equally alien to Goetia. Our magic is sprung from plant, stone andcreature, from the earth and the sea, the forest, the cemetery and the street, how then to eschew thecosmos? We are exorcists and healers of the Nocturnal Sect, how – indeed why – are we to quit thenight and seek the day?In the True Grimoire a magical manual of the 18th century was analysed in depth. Despite ineptdismissals by various commentators, the Solomonic genre is honourably represented by this text;many classic elements are present extending back to the Byzantine Hygromanteia. The latter takes itsname from a skrying process integral to the entire genre, as shown at length in ‘The Art Armadel’(TG). This methodology represents a clearly identified continuous and central feature of the magicaltradition from at least the Greek magical papyri unto Abramelin and Dee, to the present time.Returning to the period in which the True Grimoire incarnation of the Key appears on the historicalstage, in the 18th century the blue grimoire genre arrived in the New World. Thus the examination ofthe grimoire climaxed with an appraisal of the Brazilian cult of Kimbanda; within which the spirithierarchy of the True Grimoire reappears as syncretic equivalents of the Exus and Pomba Giras. Bysuch means the first volume comprehended the prehistory of the grimoires, their Byzantine andmedieval European development, and the apotheosis of the blue grimoires as the literary tradition ofCaribbean and South American magical cults. The ubiquity of the goetic current in several historicalperiods was thus implicit from Volume One.The second volume of this series was considerably more ambitious. In Geosophia the prevailing pop-occulture view of Goetia was exploded in comprehensive terms; its falsity and non-utility forcefullyunderlined. This constituted a counterthrust to decades of pseudo history and misunderstandings. Itpresented another picture, quite unfamiliar from contemporary occultism. To rectify the celestial andqabalistic emphases so long foisted upon the grimoire genre, this examination was necessarilyextensive. In the process such academic breakthroughs as the Greek Shaman thesis were presented at"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Wlength. The ancient synthesis underpinning magic in the Greco-Roman world was shown as thefountainhead of the Western tradition. The occultism of this period, previously misidentified as latesyncretism, was revealed as deriving principally from long established cross cultural grass roots. Themagic of the papyri represents not a cosmopolitan novelty, but already ancient forms of religion andfolk magic previously concealed beneath the classical veneer.The relationship of these themes to the Mystery religions of the ancient world was shown; as wastheir survival in various literary and local folk traditions. The Sibyl as a central figure of Solomonicmyth, in and out of the grimoires, was among the most important introductions of the volume. Thereciprocal relationship of ancient necromantic traditions and shamanic magic with the classical mythsand grimoires alike was emphasised.Understanding the roots of our tradition has both practical and existential purposes andimplications. Thus the exploration of practical implications in Geosophia was a natural outgrowth ofthe relations between ideas and context. Thus too, the value of greater comparability of goetictradition with various living traditions of the New World was indicated at several points.Nevertheless, various omissions were inevitable in the course of these earlier volumes; much hadto be introduced as if for the first time; much de-emphasised prior to reconsideration in the light of the‘new’ material. The Sibylline tradition might have been introduced in the True Grimoire – whereindeed a ritual involving her is usually to be found. Geosophia dealt fairly lightly with Orientalelements outside Asia Minor; and indeed with the period of the papyri, the Testament of Solomon andthe Hermetic and Theurgic movements. Neither volume made much reference to angels; therequirements of deconstruction had precedence.So too, a workable spirit technology, an approach to ‘the New Animism’ suited to the purpose,required urgent address. Additionally, re-examination of myth had to precede examination of itssyntax as concerned with ritual and cosmology alike. So a manual, and an approach to manuals, ajourney and an approach to journeys, had to precede the coming of a magical hero, and an approach tomagical heroism.Cyprian the MageHILE SOLOMON WAS, probably, a historical figure, his associations with Solomonic magic arethose of myth. Cyprian, while essentially a fictional figure become mythic, neverthelessconnects directly with the historical roots of Western magic. He is created at the crisis oflate Pagan thought in its battle with the Early Church. This was the period of Julian the Apostate;champion of Neoplatonist Theurgy, and Emperor of Rome. The part pagan, part Christian magic of theWest for the next two thousand years was born with Cyprian. Its matrix was the Roman Empire, partEuropean, part Middle Eastern. Defeated, the Pagan philosopher magus is reduced to a sorcerer, andthus with his salvation, goetia too is saved. Thus, from the medieval period, emerge the grimoires ofthe lesser clerics and the folk traditions within the former Roman Empire, where too is foundCyprian.To a degree Saint Cyprian – particularly his pre-conversion self, Cyprian the Mage – has been ‘atext for my sermon.’ The saint being in part a creation of anti-magical polemic, this is anything butinappropriate. My apostate testament retracts the arch-sorcerer’s confession. The first Faust, thearchetypal Goetic grimoire magician; steeped in Pagan Theurgy, the magical papyri and the practicalHermetica. Cause not for guilt and repentance, but pride and celebration. The fallen magus, partshaman, part philosopher, re-embraced his goetic roots – as should we."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"TAt the beginning of this volume it was premised that the blue grimoire genre not only constitutes theliterary tradition of New World magic, but represents a conscious and ably executed Goetic revival;preceding the anglophone occult revival of the nineteenth century. For magicians, these two facts areimportant in modern practical and existential terms as well as historical ones. That the second ofthese occult revivals long failed to recognise and make adequate use of the former was a stumblingblock this study seeks to rectify; by providing a basis for overcoming those implicit limitations.Cyprian – the root of the Faust figure of a later age – unites history and myth. A Roman era magicianwho personifies the blue grimoires; he walks again in the New World. It is past time to restore hisOld World legacy to Western magic and the future.Among the more interesting features encountered in the first part of the BoSC was the Great Lake ofRed Dragons. This location too is at once mythic and historical, long associated with bothnecromancy and the Sibyl. Cyprian’s biography introduced him in his original context; contemporarywith Christian polemics against magic, Jewish and Pagan. This opened a route through which toreexamine the origins and development of Western magic. Cyprian’s bookshelf – including the PGM,the Testament of Solomon and the Chaldean Oracles – amply underlines numerous enduring themesas well as neglected but vital subtexts. The merging of themes within ancient magic with those of thegrimoires brings together the worlds explored separately in Geosophia and the True Grimoire.More than the mythology of Cyprian has been involved herein; for the most part that of the spiritshas been the primary focus. Not merely to show that the dramatis personæ of magic and of myth arerelated. Rather, in their sharing of the same syntax, they are identical. This is not to affirm the ritualtheory of myth, but something far deeper. The music of myth and the mechanics of magic have anindissoluble link. The angelic Vice-regent or the Trickster enable and empower both myth and magic.Without one or other or both as essential intermediaries between worlds, neither myth nor magicoccurs. Without interaction between these worlds they are no longer locations, only scenery. So too,the participants of the cancelled event become a mere list of names. Without messenger or catalyst,all places and persons become separated by an insurmountable gulf. They are silent, not for want of ashared language, but for any language at all.Why Salamanders Have PrayersO UNDERSTAND MAGIC MYTHICALLY, is to understand much of it for the first time. The spirits,great and small, are participants in a drama; of which the magician is also part. Understandingtheir nature and deeds, their roles and interrelations, accesses the Mystery. As mentioned atvarious points in my treatise, an essential part of this all embracing drama either concerns or arisesfrom eschatology. The spirit world, afterlife, underworld, all these titles and more indicate the sameplace, the mythic centre of the goetic universe. This is the basis of the primal chthonic gnosis; olderthan philosophy and religion. True myth is unconstrained by passing religious or philosophical trends;the ‘host traditions’ of goetia have been Christian, Jewish and Pagan, religious and philosophical.Thus also the myths of goetia can assume these guises. Whatever these host traditions term theiridealised ‘Place of Return,’ it remains an argot of the eternal; the Underworld in assumed guise.Within an eschatological worldview, spirits and humans have motive and opportunity, indeed arationale for mutual approach and interaction. That this underpins the origins of any conception ofmagic and spirits cannot seriously be doubted; that magic is thereby actively involved with mythicrealities offers no objection."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"SThe new AnimismO – bypassing extra-disciplinary coffee table ontology – it has been shown possible toexamine Western magic within a variety of related frames; with or without a supreme deity,and with variations upon the same when included.With or without, there remain the principal dramatis personae; towards whom a more holistic andless dualistic approach is strongly advised. Routes forward in modern conjure magic, as well asreexamination of its baggage and prejudices, are facilitated thereby. I underline conjure magic as thisis the central aspect of a variety of operative traditions; whether or not separate from late modernontologically timid and semantically challenged approaches. In the underlying magical pantheondemons are – on the whole – redeemable and have a vested interest in assisting humans magically. Asdemonstrated throughout, neither irredeemably evil yet powerful beings nor an inescapable hell arecompatible with Western magic. Only the incorporation of themes from anti-magical ormisunderstood theologies has produced such inconsistencies within some modern schools.That Goetia represents the long enduring and central core of Western magic is established. Thus therelations between the Cyprian cycle and the Solomonic Testament are central to the argument justrehearsed. With this exploration, naturally enough, a re-examination of the spirit catalogue, and itsenduring legacy, despite recent omissions, was undertaken. Missing VIPs were reintroduced, andtheir importance underlined, as well as their relations with themes in the blue grimoires. Such themesas the conjuration of the Sybil were previously thought frivolous, prior to the release of theHygromanteia and other important material now available to thoughtful magicians.The astrological basis of the ancient synthesis (2nd–6th century CE), despite its relative noveltycompared to the ‘archaic’ themes of Geosophia, has been shown to be sympathetic to the recovery ofits goetic and shamanic substrata. Its superiority to Qabalah as a syncretic and analytical schemafollows naturally. Equally important, the distinction has been underlined between ancient astrologyand modern. The older scheme, as employed in the synthesis, dealt with ‘personal’ entities. In modernastrology this important older context has been lost. Attempts to first christianise itself, and then –misguidedly – to psychologise itself, has disguised its syncretic role from generations of sincere andhardworking occultists. In the context of conjure magic, whatever our ontological preferences, this isnow available once more.Having achieved this, the reintroduction of the real Kings and Queens of the grimoires was not onlypossible, but inevitable. With their reappearance another aspect of my work has been brought home tome. I have undertaken an extended adventure in the Underworld, as much to do with my personal lifeas my magical work; insofar as these are really separate. In the process I adopted the slogan ‘I don’tdo angels,’ a necessary abstinence, in order to free myself from the implicit dualism modern magicmistakenly assumes between them and the higher demons. In fact demons and angels frequentlyinvolve the self same ideas. The aerial angels of the fourth book of the Lemegeton are identical withthe aerial demons of the first; both represent the entourage of the Four Kings.This recovered context enabled the re-examination of the decans and mansions as a majororganising factor of spirit hierarchies. Having established that ancient astrology and Solomonic magicare deeply interlinked, reintegration naturally follows. The use of image magic, representing inter-related spirits and animals, was formerly submerged in neglected corners of the grimoires.Reconnected to their hermetic background, this restores the theurgic balance of physical and mentalaction within Solomonic ritual. The visual identity of several spirit descriptions in the ToS withHermetic images of the fixed stars links forward to consecrations of wax and earth in the Key. The"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Iinter-relations of spells employing images with conjurations of spirits, formerly mistaken for distinctactivities, are reestablished.The pattern of the spirit hierarchy also derives from ancient pantheism; as mirrored in the astrologicaltime gods, the decans and the lunar mansions. The solar Vice-regent, Marshal of the angels; Hecate,queen of nocturnal spirits and the dead; the Trickster or Hermes – ambivalent, essential – the lord ofthe aerial spirits, these deities, with their overlapping roles, define the spirit hierarchy of thegrimoires. So too their ministers, threefold in the zodiac, and Kings and Queens arranged in fours; ofdiurnal and nocturnal poles, winds and spatial directions. Subordinate spirits of the grimoires tooreflect this organisation; in like fashion to the organisation of the universe, down to the national,regional and domestic level, by both Iamblichus and the ancient astrologers.These are defining features within the ‘archaic’ practical magic, as synthesised in solunar andastrological terms in the syncretic period. The dramatis personæ of the spirits most directly workedwith underwent few changes other than changing aliases and collective titles. These features areretained to varying degrees at the operative level in all later traditions. Within the wider Westerntradition, this insight enables practical inter-changeability. Superimposed conceptions can berendered less opaque, while taking respectful account of cultural variation.The Living Tradition and the Occult RevivalsT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED throughout this encyclopædia that the operative elements of Westernmagic are derived from goetia. That Goetia is the only continuous thread connecting antiquitywith the occult revival. As identical with shamanic survivals, witchcraft and sorcery, thegrimoire tradition and its forebears – goetia is a living tradition of magic. It is this living Westerntradition from which the occult revivals of 1875 and 1975 have largely spent 140 years running away.In his dismissal of their significance the words of A.E. Waite speak volumes: that there was, asthere still is, a science of the old sanctuaries, I am certain as a mystic; that this science ... impartswisdom I am also certain; but it did not correspond to any of the arts and processes to which Irefer here, nor to anything which can be received by the mind as the result of their exaltation.Thus, in essence, has the occult revival in its many departments remained unaware of the scope –even the existence – of a ‘secret tradition’ in their midst; from which their every effective recoursewas nevertheless inherited. Goetia is a tradition of vast antiquity, yet adaptable to entirely newsurroundings; capable of effective cross cultural exchange with living traditions from other cultures,while retaining its identity. It can inhabit, and empower, host traditions of another character, and –after certain exertions – regain its separate existence without them. These are all characteristics of aliving tradition; it remains only for the revivals to embrace it."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"APPENDIXThe Testament of Solomon1Testament of Solomon, son of David, who was king in Jerusalem, and mastered and controlled allspirits of the air, on the earth, and under the earth. By means of them also he wrought all thetranscendent works of the Temple. Telling also of the authorities they wield against men, and by whatangels these demons are brought to naught.Blessed art thou, O Lord God, who didst give Solomon such authority. Glory to thee and might untothe ages.

He also continued to suck the thumb of hisright hand every day. And the child grew thin, although he was very much loved by the king.3So King Solomon called the boy one day, and questioned him, saying: Do I not love thee more thanall the artisans who are working in the Temple of God? Do I not give thee double wages and adouble supply of food? How is it that day by day and hour by hour thou growest thinner?4But the child said to the king: I pray thee, O king.

And lo, my soul is oppressed,and so my body waxes thinner every day.5Now when I Solomon heard this, I entered the Temple of God, and prayed with all my soul, night andday, that the demon might be delivered into my hands, and that I might gain authority over him. And itcame about through my prayer that grace was given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael hisarchangel. [He brought me] a little ring, having a seal consisting of an engraved stone, and said to me:Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has sent thee, the highestSabaoth. With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their helpthou shalt build up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wear this seal of God.

But the child according to the instructionsreceived from the king, threw the ring at the chest of the demon, and said: King Solomon calls theehither. And then he went off at a run to the king. But the demon cried out aloud, saying: Child, whyhast thou done this to me? Take the ring off me, and I will render to thee the gold of the earth.Only take this off me, and forbear to lead me away to Solomon.8But the child said to the demon: As the Lord God of Israel liveth, I will not brook thee. So comehither. And the child came at a run, rejoicing, to the king, and said: I have brought the demon, Oking, as thou didst command me, O my master. And behold, he stands before the gates of the courtof thy palace, crying out, and supplicating with a loud voice; offering me the silver and gold of theearth if only I would not bring him unto thee.9And when Solomon heard this, he rose up from his throne, and went outside into the vestibule of thecourt of his palace; and there he saw the demon, shuddering and trembling. And he said to him: Whoart thou? And the demon answered: I am called Ornias.10And Solomon said to him: Tell me, O demon, to what zodiacal sign thou art subject. And heanswered: To the Water-pourer. And those who are consumed with desire for the noble virginsupon earth ...[there appears to be a lacuna here], these I strangle. But in case there is nodisposition to sleep, I am changed into three forms. Whenever men come to be enamoured ofwomen, I metamorphose myself into a comely female; and I take hold of the men in their sleep, andplay with them. And after a while I again take to my wings, and hie me to the heavenly regions. Ialso appear as a lion, and I am commanded by all the demons.

Then Ornias threw the ring at the chest of Beelzeboul,saying: Solomon the king calls thee. But Beelzeboul cried aloud with a mighty voice, and shot out agreat burning flame of fire; and he arose, and followed Ornias, and came to Solomon.14And when I saw the prince of demons, I glorified the Lord God, Maker of heaven and earth, and Isaid: Blessed art thou, Lord God Almighty, who hast given to Solomon thy servant wisdom, theassessor of the wise, and hast subjected unto me all the power of the devil.15And I questioned him, and said: Who art thou? The demon replied: I am Beelzebub, the exarch ofthe demons. And all the demons have their chief seats close to me. And I it is who make manifestthe apparition of each demon. And he promised to bring to me in bonds all the unclean spirits. And Iagain glorified the God of heaven and earth, as I do always give thanks to him.16I then asked of the demon if there were females among them. And when he told me that there were, Isaid that I desired to see them. So Beelzeboul went off at high speed, and brought unto me Onoskelis,that had a very pretty shape, and the skin of a fair-hued woman; and she tossed her head.17And when she was come, I said to her: Tell me who art thou? But she said to me: I am calledOnoskelis, a spirit wrought ... [shabtai/Saturn?], lurking upon the earth. There is a golden cavewhere I lie. But I have a place that ever shifts. At one time I strangle men with a noose; at another,I creep up from the nature to the arms. But my most frequent dwelling-places are the precipices,caves, ravines. Oftentimes, however, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, andabove all with those of a dark skin. For they share my star with me; since they it is who privily oropenly worship my star, without knowing that they harm themselves, and but whet my appetite forfurther mischief. For they wish to provide money by means of memory (commemoration?), but Isupply a little to those who worship me fairly.18And I Solomon questioned her about her birth, and she replied: I was born of a voice untimely, theso-called echo of a man’s ordure dropped in a wood.19And I said to her: Under what star dost thou pass? And she answered me: Under the star of the fullmoon, for the reason that the moon travels over most things. Then I said to her: And what angel isit that frustrates thee? And she said to me: He that in thee [or through thee] is reigning. And Ithought that she mocked me, and bade a soldier strike her.

I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water.But I smiled, and said to him: As the Lord God of my fathers liveth, I will lay iron on thee to wear.But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire construction of the Temple, treading it down withthy feet. And I ordered them to give him ten waterjars to carry water in. And the demon groaned"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"terribly, and did the work I ordered him to do. And this I did, because that fierce demon Asmodeusknew even the future. And I Solomon glorified God, who gave wisdom to me Solomon his servant.And the liver of the fish and its gall I hung on the spike of a reed, and burned it over Asmodeusbecause of his being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated.26And I summoned again to stand before me Beelzeboul, the prince of demons, and I sat him down on araised seat of honour, and said to him: Why art thou alone, prince of the demons? And he said to me:Because I alone am left of the angels of heaven that came down. For I was first angel in the firstheaven being entitled Beelzeboul. And now I control all those who are bound in Tartarus. But I toohave a child, and he haunts the Red Sea. And on any suitable occasion he comes up to me again,being subject to me; and reveals to me what he has done, and I support him.27I Solomon said unto him: Beelzeboul, what is thy employment? And he answered me: I destroykings. I ally myself with foreign tyrants. And my own demons I set on to men, in order that thelatter may believe in them and be lost. And the chosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, Iexcite unto desires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they obey me, and Ibear them on to destruction. And I inspire men with envy, and [desire for] murder, and for warsand sodomy, and other evil things. And I will destroy the world.28So I said to him: Bring to me thy child, who is, as thou sayest, in the Red Sea. But he said to me: Iwill not bring him to thee. But there shall come to me another demon called Ephippas. Him will Ibind, and he will bring him up from the deep unto me. And I said to him: How comes thy son to bein the depth of the sea, and what is his name? And he answered me: Ask me not, for thou canst notlearn from me. However, he will come to thee by any command, and will tell thee openly.29I said to him: Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated. And he answered: By the holy and preciousname of the Almighty God, called by the Hebrews by a row of numbers, of which the sum is 644,and among the Greeks it is Emmanuel. And if one of the Romans adjure me by the great name ofthe power Eleéth, I disappear at once.30I Solomon was astounded when I heard this; and I ordered him to saw up Theban marbles. And whenhe began to saw the marbles, the other demons cried out with a loud voice, howling because of theirking Beelzeboul.31But I Solomon questioned him, saying: If thou wouldst gain a respite, discourse to me about thethings in heaven. And Beelzeboul said: Hear, O king, if thou burn gum, and incense, and bulb ofthe sea, with nard and saffron, and light seven lamps in an earthquake, thou wilt firmly fix thyhouse. And if, being pure, thou light them at dawn in the sun alight, then wilt thou see the heavenlydragons, how they wind themselves along and drag the chariot of the sun.32"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"And I Solomon, having heard this, rebuked him, and said: Silence for this present, and continue tosaw the marbles as I commanded thee. And I Solomon praised God, and commanded another demonto present himself to me. And one came before me who carried his face high up in the air, but the restof the spirit curled away like a snail. And it broke through the few soldiers, and raised also a terribledust on the ground, and carried it upwards; and then again hurled it back to frighten us, and askedwhat questions I could ask as a rule. And I stood up, and spat on the ground in that spot, and sealedwith the ring of God. And forthwith the dustwind stopped. Then I asked him, saying: Who art thou, Owind? Then he once more shook up a dust, and answered me: What wouldst thou have, KingSolomon? I answered him: Tell me what thou art called, and I would fain ask thee a question. Butso far I give thanks to God who has made me wise to answer their evil plots.33But [the demon] answered me: I am the spirit of the ashes (Tephras). And I said to him: What is thypursuit? And he said: I bring darkness on men, and set fire to fields; and I bring homesteads tonaught. But most busy am I in summer. However, when I get an opportunity, I creep into corners ofthe wall, by night and day. For I am offspring of the great one, and nothing less. Accordingly I saidto him: Under what star dost thou lie? And he answered: In the very tip of the moon’s horn, when itis found in the south. There is my star. For I have been bidden to restrain the convulsions of thehemitertian fever; and this is why many men pray to the hemitertian fever, using these threenames: Bultala, Thallal, Melchal. And I heal them. And I said to him: I am Solomon; whentherefore thou wouldst do harm, by whose aid dost thou do it? But he said to me: By the angel’s, bywhom also the third day’s fever is lulled to rest. So I questioned him, and said: And by what name?And he answered: That of the archangel Azael. And I summoned the archangel Azael, and set a sealon the demon, and commanded him to seize great stones, and toss them up to the workmen on thehigher parts of the Temple. And, being compelled, the demon began to do what he was bidden to do.34And I glorified God afresh who gave me this authority, and ordered another demon to come beforeme. And there came seven spirits, females, bound and woven together, fair in appearance and comely.And I Solomon, seeing them, questioned them and said: Who are ye? But they, with one accord, saidwith one voice: We are of the thirty-three elements of the cosmic ruler of the darkness.And the first said: I am Deception. The second said: I am Strife. The third: I am Klothod, which isbattle. The fourth: I am Jealousy. The fifth: I am Power. The sixth: I am Error. The seventh: I am theworst of all, and our stars are in heaven. Seven stars humble in sheen, and all together. And weare called as it were goddesses. We change our place all and together, and together we live,sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympus, sometimes in a great mountain.35So I Solomon questioned them one by one, beginning with the first, and going down to the seventh.The first said: I am Deception, I deceive and weave snares here and there. I whet and exciteheresies. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Lamechalal.36Likewise also the second said: I am Strife, strife of strifes. I bring timbers, stones, hangers, myweapons on the spot.

I part them andsplit them into parties; for Strife follows me hand in hand. I rend the husband from the sharer ofhis bed, and children from parents, and brothers from sisters. But why tell so much to my despite?I have an angel that frustrates me, the great Balthial.39Likewise also the fifth said: I am Power. By power I raise up tyrants and tear down kings. To allrebels I furnish power. I have an angel that frustrates me, Asteraôth.40Likewise also the sixth said: I am Error, O King Solomon. And I will make thee to err, as I havebefore made thee to err, when I caused thee to slay thy own brother. I will lead you into error, soas to pry into graves; and I teach them that dig, and I lead errant souls away from all piety, andmany other evil traits are mine. But I have an angel that frustrates me, Uriel.41Likewise also the seventh said: I am the worst, and I make thee worse off than thou wast; because Iwill impose the bonds of Artemis. But the locust will set me free, for by means thereof is it fatedthat thou shalt achieve my desire ......... For if one were wise, he would not turn his steps towardme.42So I Solomon, having heard and wondered, sealed them with my ring; and since they were soconsiderable, I bade them dig the foundations of the Temple of God. For the length of it was 250cubits. And I bade them be industrious, and with one murmur of joint protest they began to perform thetasks enjoined.43But I Solomon glorified the Lord, and bade another demon come before me. And there was brought tome a demon having all the limbs of a man, but without a head. And I, seeing him, said to him: Tell me,who art thou? And he answered: I am a demon. So I said to him: Which? And he answered me: I amcalled Envy. For I delight to devour heads, being desirous to secure for myself a head; but I do noteat enough, but am anxious to have such a head as thou hast.44I Solomon, on hearing this, sealed him, stretching out my hand against his chest. Whereon the demonleapt up, and threw himself down, and gave a groan, saying: Woe is me! where am I come to? Otraitor Ornias, I cannot see! So I said to him: I am Solomon. Tell me then how thou dost manage tosee. And he answered me: By means of my feelings. I then, Solomon, having heard his voice come upto me, asked him how he managed to speak. And he answered me: I, O King Solomon, am whollyvoice, for I have inherited the voices of many men. For in the case of all men who are called dumb,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"I it is who smashed their heads, when they were children and had reached their eighth day. Thenwhen a child is crying in the night, I become a spirit, and glide by means of his voice ... In thecrossways also I have many services to render, and my encounter is fraught with harm. For Igrasp in all instant a man’s head, and with my hands, as with a sword, I cut it off, and put it on tomyself. And in this way, by means of the fire which is in me, through my neck it is swallowed up. Iit is that sends grave mutilations and incurable on men’s feet, and inflict sores.45And I Solomon, on hearing this, said to him: Tell me how thou dost discharge forth the fire? Out ofwhat sources dost thou emit it? And the spirit said to me: From the Day-star. For here hath not yetbeen found that Elburion, to whom men offer prayers and kindle lights. And his name is invoked bythe seven demons before me. And he cherishes them.46But I said to him: Tell me his name. But he answered: I cannot tell thee. For if I tell his name, Irender myself incurable. But he will come in response to his name. And on hearing this, I Solomonsaid to him: Tell me then, by what angel thou art frustrated? And he answered: By the fiery flash oflightning. And I bowed myself before the Lord God of Israel, and bade him remain in the keeping ofBeelzeboul until Iax should come.47Then I ordered another demon to come before me, and there came into my presence a hound, having avery large shape, and it spoke with a loud voice, and said: Hail, Lord, King Solomon! And ISolomon was astounded. I said to it: Who art thou, O hound? And it answered: I do indeed seem tothee to be a hound, but before thou wast, O King Solomon, I was a man that wrought many unholydeeds on earth. I was surpassingly learned in letters, and was so mighty that I could hold the starsof heaven back. And many divine works did I prepare. For I do harm to men who follow after ourstar, and turn them to ... And I seize the frenzied men by the larynx, and so destroy them.48And I Solomon said to him: What is thy name? And he answered: Staff [Rabdos]. And I said to him:What is thine employment? And what results canst thou achieve? And he replied: Give me thy man,and I will lead him away into a mountainous spot, and will show him a green stone tossed to andfro, with which thou mayest adorn the temple of the Lord God.49And I Solomon, on hearing this, ordered my servant to set off with him, and to take the finger ringbearing the seal of God with him. And I said to him: Whoever shall show thee the green stone, sealhim with this finger-ring. And mark the spot with care, and bring me the demon hither. And thedemon showed him the green stone, and he sealed it, and brought the demon to me. And I Solomondecided to confine with my seal on my right hand the two, the headless demon, likewise the hound,that was so huge; he should be bound as well. And I bade the hound keep safe the fiery spirit so thatlamps as it were might by day and night cast their light through its maw on the artisans at work.50And I Solomon took from the mine of that stone 200 shekels for the supports of the table of incense,which was similar in appearance. And I Solomon glorified the Lord God, and then closed round the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"treasure of that stone. And I ordered afresh the demons to cut marble for the construction of the houseof God. And I Solomon prayed to the Lord, and asked the hound, saying: By what angel art thoufrustrated? And the demon replied: By the great Brieus.51And I praised the Lord God of heaven and earth, and bade another demon come forward to me; andthere came before me one in the form of a lion roaring. And he stood and answered me saying: Oking, in the form which I have, I am a spirit quite incapable of being perceived. Upon all men wholie prostrate with sickness I leap, coming stealthily along; and I render the man weak, so that hishabit of body is enfeebled. But I have also another glory, O king. I cast out demons, and I havelegions under my control. And I am capable of being received in my dwelling-places, along withall the demons belonging to the legions under me. But I Solomon, on hearing this, asked him: Whatis thy name? But he answered: Lion-bearer, Rath in kind. And I said to him: How art thou to befrustrated along with thy legions? What angel is it that frustrates thee? And he answered: If I tellthee my name, I bind not myself alone, but also the legions of demons under me.52So I said to him: I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell me by what name thou artfrustrated along with thy host. And the spirit answered me: The ‘great among men,’ who is to suffermany things at the hands of men, whose name is the figure 644, which is Emmanuel; he it is whohas bound us, and who will then come and plunge us from the steep under water. He is noisedabroad in the three letters which bring him down.53And I Solomon, on hearing this, glorified God, and condemned his legion to carry wood from thethicket. And I condemned the lion-shaped one himself to saw up the wood small with his teeth, forburning in the unquenchable furnace for the Temple of God.54And I worshipped the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon come forward. And there camebefore me a dragon, three-headed, of fearful hue. And I questioned him: Who art thou? And heanswered me: I am a caltrop-like spirit, whose activity is in three lines. But I blind children inwomen’s wombs, and twirl their ears round. And I make them deaf and mute. And I have again inmy third head means of slipping in. And I smite men in the limbless part of the body, and causethem to fall down, and foam, and grind their teeth. But I have my own way of being frustrated,Jerusalem being signified in writing, unto the place called ‘Of the Skull.’ For there is fore-appointed the angel of the great counsel, and now he will openly dwell on the cross. He dothfrustrate me, and to him am I subject.55But in the place where thou sittest, O King Solomon, standeth a column in the air, of purple ... Thedemon called Ephippas hath brought [it] up from the Red Sea, from inner Arabia. He it is thatshall be shut up in a skin-bottle and brought before thee. But at the entrance of the Temple, whichthou hast begun to build, O King Solomon, lies stored much gold, which dig thou up and carry off.And I Solomon sent my servant, and found it to be as the demon told me. And I sealed him with myring, and praised the Lord God."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"56So I said to him: What art thou called? And the demon said: I am the crest of dragons. And I badehim make bricks in the Temple. He had human hands.57And I adored the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon present himself. And there came beforeme a spirit in woman’s form, that had a head without any limbs, and her hair was dishevelled. And Isaid to her: Who art thou? But she answered: nay, who art thou? And why dost thou want to hearconcerning me? But, as thou wouldst learn, here I stand bound before thy face. Go then into thyroyal storehouses and wash thy hands. Then sit down afresh before thy tribunal, and ask mequestions; and thou shalt learn, O king, who I am.58And I Solomon did as she enjoined me, and restrained myself because of the wisdom dwelling in me;in order that I might hear of her deeds, and reprehend them, and manifest them to men. And I sat down,and said to the demon: What art thou? And she said: I am called among men Obizuth; and by nightI sleep not, but go my rounds over all the world, and visit women in childbirth. And divining thehour I take my stand; and if I am lucky, I strangle the child. But if not, I retire to another place.For I cannot for a single night retire unsuccessful. For I am a fierce spirit, of myriad names andmany shapes. And now hither, now thither I roam. And to westering parts I go my rounds. But as itnow is, though thou hast sealed me round with the ring of God, thou hast done nothing. I am notstanding before thee, and thou wilt not be able to command me. For I have no work other than thedestruction of children, and the making their ears to be deaf, and the working of evil to their eyes,and the binding their mouths with a bond, and the ruin of their minds, and paining of their bodies.59When I Solomon heard this, I marvelled at her appearance, for I beheld all her body to be in darkness.But her glance was altogether bright and greeny, and her hair was tossed wildly like a dragon’s; andthe whole of her limbs were invisible. And her voice was very clear as it came to me. And Icunningly said: Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated, O evil spirit? By she answered me: Bythe angel of God called Afarôt, which is interpreted Raphael, by whom I am frustrated now and forall time. His name, if any man know it, and write the same on a woman in childbirth, then I shallnot be able to enter her. Of this name the number is 640.And I Solomon having heard this, and having glorified the Lord, ordered her hair to be bound, andthat she should be hung up in front of the Temple of God; that all the children of Israel, as they passed,might see it, and glorify the Lord God of Israel, who had given me this authority, with wisdom andpower from God, by means of this signet.60And I again ordered another demon to come before me. And there came, rolling itself along, one inappearance like unto a dragon but having the face and hands of a man. And all its limbs, except thefeet, were those of a dragon; and it had wings on its back. And when I beheld it, I was astonished andsaid: Who art thou, demon, and what art thou called? And whence hast thou come? Tell me.61And the spirit answered and said: This is the first time I have stood before thee, O King Solomon. I"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"am a spirit made into a god among men, but now brought to naught by the ring and wisdomvouchsafed to thee by God. Now I am the so-called winged dragon, and I chamber not with manywomen, but only with a few that are of fair shape, which possess the name of xuli, of this star. AndI pair with them in the guise of a spirit winged in form, coitum habens per nates. And she on whomI have leapt goes heavy with child, and that which is born of her becomes eros. But since suchoffspring cannot be carried by men, the woman in question breaks wind. Such is my role. Supposethen only that I am satisfied, and all the other demons molested and disturbed by thee will speakthe whole truth. But those composed of fire will cause to be burned up by fire the material of thelogs which is to be collected by them for the building in the Temple.62And as the demon said this, I saw the spirit going forth from his mouth, and it consumed the wood ofthe frankincense-tree, and burned up all the logs which we had placed in the Temple of God. And ISolomon saw what the spirit had done, and I marvelled.63And, having glorified God, I asked the dragon-shaped demon, and said: Tell me, by what angel artthou frustrated? And he answered: By the great angel which has its seat in the second heaven,which is called in Hebrew Bazazeth. And I Solomon, having heard this, and having invoked hisangel, condemned him to saw up marbles for the building of the Temple of God; and I praised God,and commanded another demon to come before me.64And there came before my face another spirit, as it were a woman in the form she had. But on hershoulders she had two other heads with hands. And I asked her, and said: Tell me, who art thou? Andshe said to me: I am Enêpsigos, who also have a myriad names. And I said her: By what angel artthou frustrated? But she said to me: What seekest, what askest thou? I undergo changes, like thegoddess I am called. And I change again, and pass into possession of another shape. And be notdesirous therefore to know all that concerns me. But since thou art before me for this much,hearken. I have my abode in the moon, and for that reason I possess three forms. At times I ammagically invoked by the wise as Kronos. At other times, in connexion with those who bring medown, I come down and appear in another shape. The measure of the element is inexplicable andindefinable, and not to be frustrated. I then, changing into these three forms, come down andbecome such as thou seest me; but I am frustrated by the angel Rathanael, who sits in the thirdheaven. This then is why I speak to thee. Yonder temple cannot contain me.65I therefore Solomon prayed to my God, and I invoked the angel of whom Enépsigos spoke to me, andused my seal. And I sealed her with a triple chain, and (placed) beneath her the fastening of the chain.I used the seal of God, and the spirit prophesied to me, saying: This is what thou, King Solomon,doest to us. But after a time thy kingdom shall be broken, and again in season this Temple shall beriven asunder; and all Jerusalem shall be undone by the King of the Persians and Medes andChaldaeans. And the vessels of this Temple, which thou makest, shall be put to servile uses of thegods; and along with them all the jars, in which thou dost shut us up, shall be broken by the handsof men. And then we shall go forth in great power hither and thither, and be disseminated all overthe world. And we shall lead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of God is"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"stretched upon the cross. For never before doth arise a king like unto him, one frustrating us all,whose mother shall not have contact with man. Who else can receive such authority over spirits,except he, whom the first devil will seek to tempt, but will not prevail over? The number of hisname is 644, which is Emmanuel.Wherefore, O King Solomon, thy time is evil, and thy years short and evil, and to thy servantshall thy kingdom be given.66And I Solomon, having heard this, glorified God. And though I marvelled at the apology of thedemons, I did not credit it until it came true. And I did not believe their words; but when they wererealized, then I understood, and at my death I wrote this Testament to the children of Israel, and gaveit to them, so that they might know the powers of the demons and their shapes, and the names of theirangels, by which these angels are frustrated. And I glorified the Lord God of Israel, and commandedthe spirits to be bound with bonds indissoluble.67And having praised God, I commanded another spirit to come before me; and there came before myface another demon, having in front the shape of a horse, but behind of a fish. And he had a mightyvoice, and said to me: O King Solomon, I am a fierce spirit of the sea, and I am greedy of gold andsilver. I am such a spirit as rounds itself and comes over the expanses of the water of the sea, andI trip up the men who sail thereon. For I round myself into a wave, and transform myself, and thenthrow myself on ships and come right in on them. And that is my business, and my way of gettinghold of money and men. For I take the men, and whirl them round with myself, and hurl the menout of the sea. For I am not covetous of men’s bodies, but cast them up out of the sea so far. Butsince Beelzeboul, ruler of the spirits of air and of those under the earth, and lord of earthly ones,hath a joint kingship with us in respect of the deeds of each one of us, therefore I went up from thesea, to get a certain outlook in his company.68But I also have another character and role. I metamorphose myself into waves, and come up fromthe sea. And I show myself to men, so that those on earth call me Kuno[s]paston, because I assumethe human form. And my name is a true one. For by my passage up into men, I send forth a certainnausea. I came then to take counsel with the prince Beelzeboul; and he bound me and delivered meinto thy hands. And I am here before thee because of this seal, and thou dost now torment me.Behold now, in two or three days the spirit that converseth with thee will fail, because I shall haveno water.69And I said to him: Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated. And he answered: By Iameth. And Iglorified God. I commanded the spirit to be thrown into a phial along with ten jugs of sea-water oftwo measures each. And I sealed them round above the marbles and asphalt and pitch in the mouth ofthe vessel. And having sealed it with my ring, I ordered it to be deposited in the Temple of God. AndI ordered another spirit to come before me.70And there came before my face another enslaved spirit, having obscurely the form of a man, with"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"gleaming eyes, and bearing in his hand a blade. And I asked: Who art thou? But he answered: I am alascivious spirit, engendered of a giant man who died in the massacre in the time of the giants. Isaid to him: Tell me what thou art employed on upon earth, and where thou hast thy dwelling.71And he said: My dwelling is in fruitful places, but my procedure is this. I seat myself beside themen who pass along among the tombs, and in untimely season I assume the form of the dead; andif I catch any one, I at once destroy him with my sword. But if I cannot destroy him, I cause him tobe possessed with a demon, and to devour his own flesh, and the hair to fall off his chin. But I saidto him: Do thou then be in fear of the God of heaven and of earth, and tell me by what angel thouart frustrated. And he answered: He destroys me who is to become Saviour, a man whose number,if any one shall write it on his forehead, he will defeat me, and in fear I shall quickly retreat. And,indeed, if any one write this sign on him, I shall be in fear. And I Solomon, on hearing this, andhaving glorified the Lord God, shut up this demon like the rest.72And I commanded another demon to come before me. And there came before my face thirty-sixspirits, their heads shapeless like dogs, but in themselves they were human in form; with faces ofasses, faces of oxen, and faces of birds. And I Solomon, on hearing and seeing them, wondered, and Iasked them and said: Who are you? But they, of one accord with one voice, said: We are the thirty-six elements, the world-rulers of this darkness. But, O King Solomon, thou wilt not wrong us norimprison us, nor lay command on us; but since the Lord God has given thee authority over everyspirit, in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, therefore do we also present ourselvesbefore thee like the other spirits, from ram and bull, from both twin and crab, lion and virgin,scales and scorpion, archer, goat-horned, water-pourer, and fish.73Then I Solomon invoked the name of the Lord Sabaoth, and questioned each in turn as to what was itscharacter. And I bade each one come forward and tell of its actions. Then the first one came forward,and said: I am the first decanus of the zodiacal circle, and I am called the ram, and with me arethese two. So I put to them the question: Who are ye called? The first said: I, O Lord, am calledRuax, and I cause the heads of men to be idle, and I pillage their brows. But let me only hear thewords, ‘Michael, imprison Ruax,’ and at once I retreat.74And the second said: I am called Barsafael, and I cause those who are subject to my hour to feelthe pain of migraine. If only I hear the words, ‘Gabriel, imprison Barsafael,’ at once I retreat.75The third said: I am called Arôtosael. I do harm to eyes, and grievously injure them. Only let mehear the words, ‘Uriel, imprison Aratosael’ (sic), at once I retreat ...76The fifth said: I am called Iudal, and I bring about a block in the ears and deafness of hearing.

And I commanded them tofetch water in the Temple of God. And I furthermore prayed to the Lord God to cause the demonswithout, that hamper humanity, to be bound and made to approach the Temple of God. Some of thesedemons I condemned to do the heavy work of the construction of the Temple of God. Others I shut upin prisons. Others I ordered to wrestle with fire in (the making of) gold and silver, sitting down bylead and spoon. And to make ready places for the other demons in which they should be confined.108And I Solomon had much quiet in all the earth, and spent my life in profound peace, honoured by allmen and by all under heaven. And I built the entire Temple of the Lord God. And my kingdom wasprosperous, and my army was with me. And for the rest the city of Jerusalem had repose, rejoicingand delighted. And all the kings of the earth came to me from the ends of the earth to behold theTemple which I builded to the Lord God. And having heard of the wisdom given to me, they didhomage to me in the Temple, bringing gold and silver and precious stones, many and divers, andbronze, and iron, and lead, and cedar logs. And woods that decay not they brought me, for theequipment of the Temple of God.109And among them also the queen of the South, being a witch, came in great concern and bowed lowbefore me to the earth. And having heard my wisdom, she glorified the God of Israel, and she madeformal trial of all my wisdom, of all love in which I instructed her, according to the wisdom impartedto me. And all the sons of Israel glorified God.110And behold, in those days one of the workmen, of ripe old age, threw himself down before me, andsaid: King Solomon, pity me, because I am old. So I bade him stand up, and said: Tell me, old man,all you will. And he answered: I beseech you king, I have an only-born son, and he insults andbeats me openly, and plucks out the hair of my head, and threatens me with a painful death.Therefore I beseech you avenge me.111And I Solomon, on hearing this, felt compunction as I looked at his old age; and I bade the child bebrought to me. And when he was brought I questioned him whether it were true. And the youth said: Iwas not so filled with madness as to strike my father with my hand. Be kind to me, O king. For Ihave not dared to commit such impiety, poor wretch that I am. But I Solomon on hearing this fromthe youth, exhorted the old man to reflect on the matter, and accept his son’s apology. However, hewould not, but said he would rather let him die. And as the old man would not yield, I was about topronounce sentence on the youth, when I saw Ornias the demon laughing. I was very angry at thedemon’s laughing in my presence; and I ordered my men to remove the other parties, and bringforward Ornias before my tribunal. And when he was brought before me, I said to him: Accursed one,why didst thou look at me and laugh? And the demon answered: Prithee, king, it was not because ofthee I laughed, but because of this ill-starred old man and the wretched youth, his son. For afterthree days his son will die untimely; and lo, the old man desires to foully make away with him."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"112But I Solomon, having heard this, said to the demon: Is that true that thou speakest? And heanswered: It is true; O king. And I, on hearing that, bade them remove the demon, and that theyshould again bring before me the old man with his son. I bade them make friends with one anotheragain, and I supplied them with food. And then I told the old man after three days to bring his sonagain to me here; and, said I, I will attend to him. And they saluted me, and went their way.113And when they were gone I ordered Ornias to be brought forward, and said to him: Tell me how youknow this; and he answered: We demons ascend into the firmament of heaven, and fly about amongthe stars. And we hear the sentences which go forth upon the souls of men, and forthwith we come,and whether by force of influence, or by fire, or by sword, or by some accident, we veil our act ofdestruction; and if a man does not die by some untimely disaster or by violence, then we demonstransform ourselves in such a way as to appear to men and be worshipped in our human nature.114I therefore, having heard this, glorified the Lord God, and again I questioned the demon, saying: Tellme how ye can ascend into heaven, being demons, and amidst the stars and holy angelsintermingle.And he answered: Just as things are fulfilled in heaven, so also on earth (are fulfilled) the typesof all of them. For there are principalities, authorities, world-rulers, and we demons fly about inthe air; and we hear the voices of the heavenly beings, and survey all the powers. And as havingno ground (basis) on which to alight and rest, we lose strength and fall off like leaves from trees.And men seeing us imagine that the stars are falling from heaven. But it is not really so, O king;but we fall because of our weakness, and because we have nowhere anything to lay hold of; and sowe fall down like lightnings in the depth of night and suddenly. And we set cities in flames and firethe fields. For the stars have firm foundations in the heavens like the sun and the moon.115And I Solomon, having heard this, ordered the demon to be guarded for five days. And after the fivedays I recalled the old man, and was about to question him. But he came to me in grief and with blackface. And I said to him: Tell me, old man, where is thy son? And what means this garb? And heanswered: Lo, I am become childless, and sit by my son’s grave in despair. For it is already twodays that he is dead. But I Solomon, on hearing that, and knowing that the demon Ornias had told methe truth, glorified the God of Israel.116And the queen of the South saw all this, and marvelled, glorifying the God of Israel; and she beheldthe Temple of the Lord being builded. And she gave a siklos of gold and one hundred myriads ofsilver and choice bronze, and she went into the Temple. And (she beheld) the altar of incense and thebrazen supports of this altar, and the gems of the lamps flashing forth of different colours, and of thelamp-stand of stone, and of emerald, and hyacinth, and sapphire; and she beheld the vessels of gold,and silver, and bronze, and wood, and the folds of skins dyed red with madder. And she saw thebases of the pillars of the Temple of the Lord. All were of one gold ... apart from the demons whom Icondemned to labour. And there was peace in the circle of my kingdom and over all the earth."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"117And it came to pass, which I was in my kingdom, the King of the Arabians, Adares, sent me a letter,and the writing of the letter was written as follows:To King Solomon, all hail! Lo, we have heard, and it hath been heard unto all the ends of theearth, concerning the wisdom vouchsafed in thee, and that thou art a man merciful from the Lord.And understanding hath been granted thee over all the spirits of the air, and on earth, and underthe earth. Now, forasmuch as there is present in the land of Arabia a spirit of the following kind:at early dawn there begins to blow a certain wind until the third hour. And its blast is harsh andterrible, and it slays man and beast. And no spirit can live upon earth against this demon. I praythee then, forasmuch as the spirit is a wind, contrive something according to the wisdom given inthee by the Lord thy God, and deign to send a man able to capture it. And behold, King Solomon, Iand my people and all my land will serve thee unto death. And all Arabia shall be at peace withthee, if thou wilt perform this act of righteousness for us. Wherefore we pray thee, contemn notour humble prayer, and suffer not to be utterly brought to naught the eparchy subordinated to thyauthority. Because we are suppliants, both I and my people and all my land. Farewell to my Lord.All health!118And I Solomon read this epistle; and I folded it up and gave it to my people, and said to them: Afterseven days shalt thou remind me of this epistle. And Jerusalem was built, and the Temple wasbeing completed. And there was a stone, the end stone of the corner lying there, great, chosen out,one which I desired to lay in the head of the corner of the completion of the Temple. And all theworkmen, and all the demons helping them, came to the same place to bring up the stone and lay iton the pinnacle of the holy Temple, and were not strong enough to stir it, and lay it upon thecorner allotted to it. For that stone was exceedingly great and useful for the corner of the Temple.119And after seven days, being reminded of the epistle of Adares, King of Arabia, I called my servantand said to him: Order thy camel and take for thyself a leather flask, and take also this seal. Andgo away into Arabia to the place in which the evil spirit blows; and there take the flask, and thesignet-ring in front of the mouth of the flask, and (hold them) towards the blast of the spirit. Andwhen the flask is blown out, thou wilt understand that the demon is (in it). Then hastily tie up themouth of the flask, and seal it securely with the seal-ring, and lay it carefully on the camel andbring it me hither. And if on the way it offer thee gold or silver or treasure in return for letting itgo, see that thou be not persuaded. But arrange without using oath to release it. And then if itpoint out to the places where are gold or silver, mark the places and seal them with this seal. Andbring the demon to me. And now depart, and fare thee well.120Then the youth did as was bidden him. And he ordered his camel, and laid on it a flask, and set offinto Arabia. And the men of that region would not believe that he would be able to catch the evilspirit. And when it was dawn, the servant stood before the spirit’s blast, and laid the flask on theground, and the finger-ring on the mouth of the flask. And the demon blew through the middle of thefingerring into the mouth of the flask, and going in blew out the flask. But the man promptly stood upto it and drew tight with his hand the mouth of the flask, in the name of the Lord God of Sabaôth. And"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"the demon remained within the flask. And after that the youth remained in that land three days to maketrial. And the spirit no longer blew against that city. And all the Arabs knew that he had safely shut inthe spirit.121Then the youth fastened the flask on the camel, and the Arabs sent him forth on his way with muchhonour and precious gifts, praising and magnifying the God of Israel. But the youth brought in the bagand laid it in the middle of the Temple. And on the next day, I King Solomon, went into the Temple ofGod and sat in deep distress about the stone of the end of the corner. And when I entered the Temple,the flask stood up and walked around some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and did homage tome. And I marvelled that even along with the bottle the demon still had power and could walk about;and I commanded it to stand up. And the flask stood up, and stood on its feet all blown out. And Iquestioned him, saying: Tell me, who art thou? And the spirit within said: I am the demon calledEphippas, that is in Arabia. And I said to him: Is this thy name? And he answered: Yes;wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire and do to death.122And I said to him: By what angel art thou frustrated? And he answered: By the only-ruling God,that hath authority over me even to be heard. He that is to be born of a virgin and crucified by theJews on a cross. Whom the angels and archangels worship. He doth frustrate me, and enfeeble meof my great strength, which has been given me by my father the devil. And I said to him: What canstthou do? And he answered: I am able to remove mountains, to overthrow the oaths of kings. Iwither trees and make their leaves to fall off. And I said to him: Canst thou raise this stone, andlay it for the beginning of this corner which exists in the fair plan of the Temple? And he said: notonly raise this, O king; but also, with the help of the demon who presides over the Red Sea, I willbring up the pillar of air, and will stand it where thou wilt in Jerusalem.123Saying this, I laid stress on him, and the flask became as if depleted of air. And I placed it under thestone, and (the spirit) girded himself up, and lifted it up top of the flask. And the flask went up thesteps, carrying the stone, and laid it down at the end of the entrance of the Temple. And I Solomon,beholding the stone raised aloft and placed on a foundation, said: Truly the Scripture is fulfilled,which says: ‘The stone which the builders rejected on trial, that same is become the head of thecorner.’ For this it is not mine to grant, but God’s, that the demon should be strong enough to liftup so great a stone and deposit it in the place I wished.124And Ephippas led the demon of the Red Sea with the column. And they both took the column andraised it aloft from the earth. And I outwitted these two spirits, so that they could not shake the entireearth in a moment of time. And then I sealed round with my ring on this side and that, and said:Watch. And the spirits have remained upholding it until this day, for proof of the wisdom vouchsafedto me. And there the pillar was hanging of enormous size, in mid air, supported by the winds. Andthus the spirits appeared underneath, like air, supporting it. And if one looks fixedly, the pillar is alittle oblique, being supported by the spirits; and it is so to day.125"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"And I Solomon questioned the other spirit which came up with the pillar from the depth of the RedSea. And I said to him: Who art thou, and what calls thee? And what is thy business? For I hearmany things about thee. And the demon answered: I, O King Solomon, am called Abezithibod. I ama descendant of the archangel. Once as I sat in the first heaven, of which the name is Ameleouth –I then am a fierce spirit and winged, and with a single wing, plotting against every spirit underheaven. I was present when Moses went in before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I hardened hisheart. I am he whom Iannes and Iambres invoked homing [?] with Moses in Egypt. I am he whofought against Moses with wonders with signs.126I said therefore to him: How wast thou found in the Red Sea? And he answered: In the exodus of thesons of Israel I hardened the heart of Pharaoh. And I excited his heart and that of his ministers.And I caused them to pursue after the children of Israel. And Pharaoh followed with (me) and allthe Egyptians. Then I was present there, and we followed together. And we all came up upon theRed Sea. And it came to pass when the children of Israel had crossed over, the water returned andhid all the host of the Egyptians and all their might. And I remained in the sea, being kept underthis pillar. But when Ephippas came, being sent by thee, shut up in the vessel of a flask, he fetchedme up to thee.127I, therefore, Solomon, having heard this, glorified God and adjured the demons not to disobey me, butto remain supporting the pillar. And they both sware, saying: The Lord thy God liveth, we will not letgo this pillar until the world’s end. But on whatever day this stone fall, then shall be the end of theworld.128And I Solomon glorified God, and adorned the Temple of the Lord with all fair-seeming. And I wasglad in spirit in my kingdom, and there was peace in my days. And I took wives of my own fromevery land, who were numberless. And I marched against the Jebusaeans, and there I saw aJebusaean, daughter of a man: and fell violently in love with her, and desired to take her to wife alongwith my other wives. And I said to their priests: Give me the Sonmanites (i.e. Shunammite) to wife.But the priests of Moloch said to me: If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship our gods, thegreat god Raphan and the god called Moloch. I therefore was in fear of the glory of God, and didnot follow to worship. And I said to them: I will not worship a strange god. What is this proposal,that ye compel me to do so much? But they said: ... by our fathers.129And when I answered that I would on no account worship strange gods, they told the maiden not tosleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to the gods. I then was moved, but crafty Eros broughtand laid by her for me five grasshoppers, saying: Take these grasshoppers, and crush them togetherin the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you. And this I actually did. And at oncethe Spirit of God departed from me, and I became weak as well as foolish in my words. And after thatI was obliged by her to build a temple of idols to Baal, and to Rapha, and to Moloch, and to the otheridols.130"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God quite departed from me; and myspirit was darkened, and I became the sport of idols and demons.
