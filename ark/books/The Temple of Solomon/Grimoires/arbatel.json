For Magick itself,which the ancients did so divinely contemplate, is scandalized with bearing the badgeof all diabolical sorceries: which Art (saith Mirandula) Pauci intelligunt, multi repre-hendunt, & sicut canes ignotos semper allatrant: Few understood, many reprehend, andas dogges barke at those they know not: so doe many condemn and hate the thingsthey understand not. Many men there are, that abhor the very name and wordMagus, because of Simon Magus, who being not Magus, but Goes, that is, familiarwith evil Spirits, usurped that Title. But Magicke and Witchcraft are far differingSciences; whereof Pliny1 being ignorant, scoffeth thereat: for Nero (saith Pliny) whohad the most excellent Magicians of the East sent to him by Ty ri da tes king of Arme-nia, who held that kingdom by him, found the Art after long study and labour alto-gether ridiculous. Now Witchcraft and Sorcery, are works done merely by the devil,which with respect unto some covenant made with man, he acteth by men his instru-ments, to accomplish his evil ends: of these, the histories of all ages, people andcountries, as also the holy Scriptures, afford us sundry examples. But Magus is a Persian word primitively, whereby is expressed such a one as isaltogether conversant in things divine; as Plato affirmeth, the Art of Magick is the artof worshipping God: and the Persians call their gods \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005, hence Apollonius saith,that Magus is either [illegible Greek]2 or [illegible Greek]3, that is, that Magus is aname sometime of him that is a god by nature, & sometimes of him that is in the ser-vice of God: in which latter sense it is taken in Matt., 2.1,2. when the wise men cameto worship Jesus, and this is the first and highest kind, which is called divine Magick;and these the Latins did entitle sapientes, or wise men: for the feare and worship ofGod, is the beginning of knowledge. These wise men the Greeks call Philosophers;and amongst the Egyptians they were termed Priests; the Hebrews termed themCabalistos, Prophets, Scribes and Pharisees; and amongst the Babylonians they weredifferenced by the name of Caldeans; & by the Persians they were called Magicians:and one speaking of Sosthenes, one of the ancient Magicians, useth these words: Etverum Deum merita majestate prosequitur, & angelos ministros Dei, sed veri ejus venera-tioni novit assistere; idem dæmonas prodit terrenos, Vagos, humanitatis inimicos; Sosthenesascribeth the due Majesty to the true God, & acknowledgeth that his Angels are1.

The handwritten Greek of Turner: 3."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2ministers and messengers which attend the worship of the true God; he also hathdelivered, that there are devils earthly and wandering, and enemies to mankind. So that the word Magus of itself imports a Contemplator of divine & heavenlySciences; but under the name Magick, are all unlawful Arts comprehended; as Necro-mancy and Witchcraft, and such Arts which are effected by combination with thedevil, and whereof he is a party.These Witches and Necromancers are also called Malefici or venefici; sorcerersor poisoners; of which names witches are rightly called, who without the Art ofMagick do indeed use the help of the devil himself to do mischief; practising to mixthe powder of dead bodies with other things by the help of the devil prepared; and atother times to make pictures of wax, clay, or otherwise (as it were Sacramentaliter) toeffect those things which the devil by other means bringeth to pass. Such were, andto this day partly, if not altogether, are the corruptions which have made odious thevery name of Magick, having chiefly sought, as the manner of all impostures is, tocounterfeit the highest and most noble part of it. A second kind of Magick is Astrologie, which judgeth of the events of things tocome, natural and humane, by the motions and influences of the stars upon the lowerelements, by them observed and understood. Philo Judaeus affirmeth, that by this part of Magick or Astrologie, together withthe motions of the Stars and other heavenly bodies, Abraham found out the knowl-edge of the true God while he lived in Caldea, Qui Contemplatione Creaturarum, cog-novit Creatorem (saith Damascen) who knew the Creator by the contemplation of thecreature. Josephus reporteth of Abraham, that he instructed the Egyptians in Arith-metic and Astronomy; who before Abraham’s coming unto them, knew none of theseSciences. Abraham sanctitate & sapientia omnium præstantissimus, primum Caldæos, deindePhoenices, demum Egyptios Sacerdotes, Astrologia & Divina docuerit. Abraham the holi-est and wisest of men, did first teach the Caldeans, then the Phoenicians, lastly theEgyptian Priests, Astrologie and Divine knowledge. Without doubt, Hermes Trismegistus, that divine Magician and Philosopher,who (as some say) lived long before Noah, attained to much Divine knowledge of theCreator through the study of Magick and Astrologie; as his writings testifie. The third kind of Magick containeth the whole Philosophy of Nature; whichbringeth to light the innermost virtues, and extracteth them out of Nature’s hiddenbosome to humane use: Virtutes in centro centri latentes; Virtues hidden in the centreof the Centre, according to the Chymists: of this sort were Albertus, Arnoldus de villanova, Raymond, Bacon and others, &c. The Magick these men professed, is thus defined. Magia est connexio a viro sapi-ente agentium per naturam cum patientibus, sibi, congruenter respondentibus, ut indeopera prodeant, non sine corum admiratione qui causam ignorant. Magick is the connex-ion of natural agents and patients, answerable each to other, wrought by a wise man,to the bringing forth of such effects as are wonderful to those that know not theircauses."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"3In all these, Zoroaster was well learned, especially in the first and highest: for inhis Oracles he confesseth God to be the first and the highest; he believeth of theTrinity, which he would not investigate by any natural knowledge: he speaketh ofAngels, and of Paradise; approveth the immortality of the soul; teacheth Truth,Faith, Hope, and Love, discoursing of the abstinence and charity of the Magi. Of this Zoroaster, Eusebius in the Theology of the Phoenicians, using Zoroaster’sown words: Hæc ad verbum scribit (saith Eusebius) Deus primus, incorruptibilium, sem-piternus, ingenitus, expers partium sibi ipsi simillimus, bonorum omnium auriga, muneranon expectans, optimus, prudentissimus, pater juris, sine doctrina justitiam per doctus,natur perfectus, sapiens, sacræ naturæ unicus inventor, &c. Thus saith Zoroaster, wordfor word: God the first, incorruptable, everlasting, unbegotten, without parts, mostlike himself, the guide of all good, expecting no reward, the best, the wisest, thefather of right, having learned justice without teaching, perfect, wise by nature, theonely inventor thereof. So that a Magician is no other but divinorum cultor & interpres, a studiousobserver and expounder of divine things; and the Art itself is none other quam Natu-ralis Philosophiæ absoluta consummatio, then the absolute perfection of Natural Philos-ophy. Nevertheless there is a mixture in all things, good with evil, of falsehood withtruth, of corruption with purity. The good, the truth, the purity, in every kinde, maywell be embraced: As in the ancient worshipping of God by Sacrifice, there was noman knowing God among the Elders, that did not forbear to worship the God of allpower, or condemn that kinde of Worship, because the devil was so adored in theimage of Baal, Dagon, Astaroth, Chemosh, Jupiter, Apollo, and the like. Neither did the abuse of Astrology terrify Abraham, (if we believe the mostancient and religious writers) from observing the motions and natures of the heav-enly bodies. Neither can it dehort wise and learned men in these days from attribut-ing those vertues, influences, and inclinations, to the Stars and other Lights ofheaven, which God hath given to those his glorious creatures. I must expect some calumnies and obtrectations against this, from the maliciousprejudiced men, and the lazie affecters of Ignorance, of whom this age swarms: butthe voice and sound of the Snake and Goose is all one. But our stomacks are not nowso queazie and tender, after so long time feeding upon solid Divinity, nor we soumbragious and startling, having been so long enlightened in God’s path, that weshould relapse into that childish Age, in which Aristotle's Metaphysicks, in a Councilin France, was forbid to be read. But I incite the Reader to a charitable opinion hereof, with a Christian Protes-tation of an innocent purpose therein; and intreat the Reader to follow this advice ofTa bæus, Qui litigant, sint ambo in conspectis tuo mali & rei. And if there be any scandalin this enterprise of mine, it is taken, not given. And this comfort I have in that Axi-ome of Trismegistus, Qui pius est, summe philosopatur. And therefore I present it with-out disguise, and object it to all of candor and indifferencie: and of Readers, of whomthere be four sorts, as one observes: Spunges, which attract all without distinguish-ing; Hour-glasses, which receive, and pour out as fast; Bags, which retain onely the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4dregs of Spices, and let the Wine escape; and Sieves, which retain the best onely.Some there are of the last sort, and to them I present this Occult Philosophy, knowingthat they may reap good thereby. And they who are severe against it, they all pardonthis my opinion, that such their severity proceeds from Self-guiltiness; and give meleave to apply that of Ennodius that it is the nature of Self-wickedness, to think thatof others, which themselves deserve.

Observe thisLaw, and the eyes of thy understanding shall be opened, to understand secret things;and thou shalt have whatsoever thy minde desireth to be divinely revealed unto thee.Thou shalt have also the Angels and Spirits of God prompt and ready in their natureto minister unto thee, as much as any humane minde can desire.

Use thy Gifts, be vigilant in thy Calling; and let theWord of God never depart from thy mouth.Aphorism 4.Be obedient to good Admonitions: avoid all procrastination: accustom thy self toContancie and Gravity, both in thy words and deeds.

Flee from earthly things; seek after heavenly things.Put no confidence in thy own wisdom; but look unto God in all things, according tothat sentence of the Scripture: When we know not what we shall do, unto thee, O God,do we lift up our eyes, and from thee we expect our help. For where all humane refuges doforsake us, there will the help of God shine forth, according to the saying of Philo.

For all Ignorance is tribulation of the minde; therefore call upon the Lordin thy ignorance, and he will hear thee. And remember that thou give honour untoGod, and say with the Psalmist, Not unto us, Lord, but unto thy Name give the glory.The second Sep tena ry.Aphorism 8.Even as the Scripture testifies, that God appointeth names to things or persons, andalso with them hath distributed certain powers and offices out of his treasures: so theCharacters and Names of Stars have not any power by reason of their figure or pro-nunciation, but by reason of the vertue or office which God hath ordained by natureeither to such a Name or Character. For there is no power either in heaven or inearth, or hell, which doth not descend from God; and without his permission, theycan neither give or draw forth into any action, any thing they have. Aphorism 9.That is the chiefest wisdom, which is from God; and next, that which is in spiritualcreatures; afterwards, in corporal creatures; fourthly, in Nature, and natural things.The Spirits that are apostate, and reserved to the last judgement, do follow these,after a long interval. Sixthly, the ministers of punishments in hell, and the obedientunto God. Seventhly, the Pigmies do not possess the lowest place, and they whoinhabit in elements, and elementary things. It is convenient therefore to know anddiscern all differences of the wisdom of the Creator and the Creatures, that it may becertainly manifest unto us, what we ought to assume to our use of every thing, andthat we may know in truth how and in what maner that may be done. For truelyevery creature is ordained for some profitable end to humane nature, and for the ser-vice thereof; as the holy Scriptures, Reason, and Experience, do testifie."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"9Aphorism 10.God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible andinvisible, in the holy Scriptures proposeth himself to have an eye over us; and as atender father which loveth his children, he teacheth us what is profitable, and whatnot; what we are to avoid, and what we are to embrace: then he allureth us to obedi-ence with great promises of corporal and eternal benefits, and deterreth us (withthreatning of punishments) from those things which are not profitable for us.

Appoint therefore to him who solely dependeth upon God, the wisdom of everycreature to serve and obey him, nolens volens, willing or unwilling. And in this, theomnipotency of God shineth forth. It consisteth therefore in this, that we will dis-cern the creatures which serve us, from those that are unwilling; and that we maylearn how to accommodate the wisdom and offices of every creature unto our selves.This Art is not delivered, but divinely. Unto whom God will, he revealeth his secrets;but to whom he will not bestow any thing out of his treasuries, that person shallattain to nothing without the will of God. Therefore we ought to desire [illegible Greek]1 from God alone, which willmercifully impart these things unto us.

But because thou mayst be certain of the truth. arid mayst not doubtwhether the spirits that speak with thee, do declare things true or false, let it onelydepend upon thy faith in God; that thou mayst say with Paul, I know on whom I trust.If no sparrow can fall to the ground without the will of the Father which is in heaven,How much more will not God suffer thee to be deceived, O thou of little faith, ifthou dependest wholly upon God, and adherest onely to him?Aphorism 13.The Lord liveth; and all things which live, do live in him.

God liveth, and thy soul liveth: keep thy Covenant, and thou hast whatsoeverthe spirit shall reveal unto thee in God, because all things shall be done which theSpirit promiseth unto thee. Aphorism 18.There are other names of the Olymick spirits delivered by others; but they onely areeffectual, which are delivered to any one, by the Spirit the revealer, visible or invisi-ble: and they are delivered to every one as they are predestinated: therefore they arecalled Constellations; and they seldome have any efficacie above 40 yeers. Thereforeit is most safe for the young practisers of Art, that they work by the offices of theSpirits alone, without their names; and if they are pre-ordained to attain the Art ofMagick, the other parts of the Art will offer themselves unto them of their ownaccord. Pray therefore for a constant faith, and God will bring to pass all things indue season.Aphorism 19.Olympus and the inhabitants thereof, do of their own accord offer themselves to menin the forms of Spirits, and are ready to perform their Offices for them, whether theywill or not: by how much the rather will they attend you, if they are desired? Butthere do appear also evil Spirits, and destroyers, which is caused by the envy and mal-ice of the devil; and because men do allure and draw them unto themselves with theirsin, as a punishment due to sinners. Whosoever therefore desireth familiarly to havea conversation with Spirits, let him keep himself from enormious sins, and diligentlypray to the most High to be his keeper; and he shall break through all the snares andimpediments of the devil: and let him apply himself to the service of God, and hewill give him an increase in wisdom."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"17Aphor 20.All things are possible to them that believe them, and are willing to receive them; butto the incredulous and unwilling, all things are unpossible: there is no greater hinder-ance then a wavering minde, levity, unconstancy, foolish babbling, drunkenness,lusts, and disobedience to the word of God. A Magician therefore ought to be a manthat is godly, honest, constant in his words and deeds, having a firm faith towardGod, prudent, and covetous of nothing but of wisdom about divine things.Aphorism 21.When you would call any of the Olympick Spirits, observe the rising of the Sun thatday, and of what nature the Spirit is which you desire; and saying the prayer follow-ing, your desires shall he perfected.

Andthese secrets are either concerning things divine, natural or humane.

Aphorism 24.The greatest secrets are number seven.1. The first is the curing of all diseases in the space of seven dayes, either bycharacter, or by natural things, or by the superior Spirits with the divine assistance. 2. The second is, to be able to prolong life to whatsoever age we please: I say, acorporal and natural life. 3. The third is, to have the obedience of the creatures in the elements which arein the forms of personal Spirits; also of Pigmies, Sagani, Nymphes, Dryades, andSpirits of the woods. 4. The fourth is, to be able to discourse with knowledge and understanding ofall things visible and invisible, and to understand the power of every thing, and towhat it belongeth. 5. The fifth is, that a man be able to govern himself according to that end forwhich God hath appointed him. 6. The sixth is, to know God, and Christ, and his holy Spirit: this is the perfec-tion of the Microcosmus. 7 The seventh, to be regenerate, as Henochius the King of the inferiour world. These seven secrets a man of an honest and constant minde may learn of theSpirits, without any offence unto God.The mean Secrets are likewise seven in number.1. The first is, the transmutation of Metals, which is vulgarly called Alchymy;which certainly is given to very few, and not but of special grace. 2. The second is, the curing of diseases with Metals, either by the magnetickvertues of precious stones, or by the use of the Philosophers stone, and the like. 3 The third is, to be able to perform Astronomical and Mathematical miracles,such as are Hydraulick-engines, to administer business by the influence of Heaven,and things which are of the like sort. 4.

The sixth is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised with thehands and offices of the body. 7. The seventh is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised by theangelical nature of man.The lesser secrets are seven.1. The first is, to do a thing diligently, and to gather together much money. 2. The second is, to ascend from a mean state to dignities and honours, and toestablish a newer family, which may be illustrious and do great things. 3. The third is, to excel in military affairs, and happily to achieve to great things,and to be an head of the head of Kings and Princes. 4. To be a good house-keeper both in the Country and City. 5.

To be a Divine according to the Bible and Schooles, which all writers ofdivinity both old and new have taught.Aphorism 25.We have already declared what a secret is, the kindes and species thereof: itremaineth now to shew how we may attain to know those things which we desire. The true and onely way to all secrets, is to have recourse unto God the Authorof all good; and as Christ teacheth, In the first place seek ye the kingdom of God and hisrighteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. 2. Also see that your hearts be not burthened with surfeting, and drunkenness, and thecares of this life. 3. Also commit your cares unto the Lord, and he will do it. 4. Also I the Lord thy God do teach thee, what things are profitable for thee, and doguide thee in the way wherein thou walkest. 5. And I will give thee understanding, and will teach thee in the way wherein thoushalt go, and I will guide thee with my eye. 6 Also if you which are evil, know how to give good things to your children, how muchmore shall your Father which is in heaven give his holy Spirit to them that ask him? 7. If you will do the will of my Father which is in heaven, ye are truly my disciples,and we will come unto you, and make our abode with you. If you draw these seven places of Scripture from the letter unto the Spirit, orinto action, thou canst out erre, but shalt attain to the desired bound; thou shalt noterre from the mark, and God himself by his holy Spirit will teach thee true and prof-itable things: he will give also his ministring Angels unto thee, to be thy companions,helpers, and teachers of all the secrets of the world, and he will command every crea-ture to be obedient unto thee, so that cheerfully rejoycing thou maist say with the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"20Apostles, That the Spirits are obedient unto thee; so that at length thou shalt be cer-tain of the greatest thing of all, That thy name is written in Heaven.Aphorism 26.There is another way which is more common, that secrets may be revealed unto theealso, when thou art unwitting thereof, either by God, or by Spirits which have secretsin their power; or by dreams, or by strong imaginations and impressions, or by theconstellation of a nativity by celestial knowledge. After this manner are made heroickmen, such as there are very many, and all learned men in the world, Plato, Aristotle,Hippocrates, Galen, Euclides, Archimedes, Hermes Trismegistus the father secrets, withTheophrastus, Paracelsus; all which men had in themselves all the vertues of secrets.Hitherto also are referred, Homer, Hesiod, Orpheus, Pytagoras; but these had not suchgifts of secrets as the former. To this are referred, the Nymphes, and sons of Melu-sina, and Gods of the Gentiles, Achilles, Æneas, Hercules: also, Cyrus, Alexander thegreat, Julius Cæsar, Lucullus, Sylla. Marius. It is a canon, That every one know his own Angel. and that he obey him accord-ing to the word of God; and let him beware of the snares of the evil Angel, lest he beinvolved in the calamities of Brute and Marcus Antonius. To this refer the book ofJovianus Pontanus of Fortune, and his Eutichus. The third way is, diligent and hard labor, without which no great thing can beobtained from the divine Deity worthy admiration, as it is said,Tu nihil invita dices facie sue Minerva. Nothing canst thou do or say againstMinerva’s will.We do detest all evil Magicians, who make themselves associates with the devilswith their unlawful superstitions, and do obtain and effect some things which Godpermitteth to be done, instead of the punishment of the devils. So also they do otherevil acts, the devil being the author, as the Scripture testifie of Judas. To these arereferred all idolaters of old, and of our age, and abusers of Fortune, such as the hea-thens are full of. And to these do appertain all Charontick evocation of Spirits theworks of Saul with the woman, and Lucanus prophesie of the deceased souldier, con-cerning the event of the Pharsalian war, and the like.Aphorism 27.Make a Circle with a center A, which is B. C. D. E. At the East let there be B.C. asquare. At the North, C.D. At the West, D.E. And at the South, E.D. Divide theSeveral quadrants into seven parts, that there may be in the whole 28 parts: and letthem be again divided into four parts, that there may be 112 parts of the Circle: andso many are the true secrets to revealed. And this Circle in this manner divided, isthe seal of the secrets of the world, which they draw from the onely center A, that is,from the invisible God, unto the whole creature. The Prince of the Oriental secrets isresident in the middle, and hath three Nobles on either side, every one whereof hath"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"21four under him, and the Prince himself hath four appertaining unto him. And in thismanner the other Princes and Nobles have their quadrants of secrets, with their foursecrets. But the Oriental secret is the study of all wisdom; The West, of strength;The South, of tillage; The North, of more rigid life. So that the Eastern secrets arecommended to be the best; the Meridian to be mean; and the East and North to belesser. The use of this seal of secrets is, that thereby thou maist know whence theSpirits or Angels are produced, which may teach the secrets delivered unto themfrom God. But they have names taken from their offices and powers, according tothe gift which God hath severally distributed to every one of them. One hath thepower of the sword; another, of the pestilence; and another, of inflicting famine uponthe people, as it is ordained by God. Some are destroyers of Cities, as those two were,who were sent to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrha, and the places adjacent, exampleswhereof the holy Scripture witnesseth. Some are the watch-men over Kingdoms;others the keepers of private persons; and from thence, anyone may easily form theirnames in his own language: so that he which will, may ask a physical Angel, mathe-matical, or philosophical, or an Angel of civil wisdom, or of supernatural or naturalwisdom, or for any thing whatsoever; and let him ask seriously, with a great desire ofhis minde, and with faith and constancy and without doubt, that which he asketh heshall receive from the Father and God of all Spirits. This faith surmounteth all seals,and bringeth them into subjection to the will of man. The Characteristical maner ofcalling Angels succeedeth this faith, which dependeth onely on divine revelation; Butwithout the said faith preceding it, it lieth in obscurity. Nevertheless, if any one willuse them for a memorial, and not otherwise, and as a thing simply created by God tohis purpose, to which such a spiritual power or essence is bound; he may use themwithout any offence unto God. But let him beware, lest that he fall into idolatry, andthe snares of the devil, who with his cunning sorceries, easily deceiveth the unwary.And he is not taken but onely by the finger of God, and is appointed to the service ofman; so that they unwillingly serve the godly; but not without temptations and trib-ulations, because the commandment hath it, That he shall bruise the heel of Christ,the seed of the woman. We are therefore to exercise our selves about spiritual things,with fear and trembling, and with great reverence towards God, and to be conversantin spiritual essences with gravity and justice. And he which medleth with suchthings, let him beware of all levity, pride, covetousness, vanity, envy and ungodliness,unless he wil miserably perish.Aphorism 28.Because all good is from God, who is onely good, those things which we wouldobtain of him, we ought to seek them by prayer in Spirit and Truth, and a simpleheart. The conclusion of the secret of secrets is, That every one exercise himself inprayer, for those things which he desires, and he shall not suffer a repulse. Let notany one despise prayer; for by whom God is prayed unto, to him he both can and willgive. Now let us acknowledge him the Author, from whom let us humbly seek for our"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22desires. A merciful & good Father, loveth the sons of desires, as Daniel; and soonerheareth us, then we are able to overcome the hardness of our hearts to pray. But hewill not that we give holy things to dogs, nor despise and condemn the gifts of histreasury. Therefore diligently and often read over and over the first Septenary ofsecrets, and guide and direct thy life and all thy thoughts according to those precepts;and all things shall yield to the desires of thy minde in the Lord, to whom thou trust-est.The Fifth SeptenaryAphorism 29.As our study of Magick proceedeth in order from general Rules premised, let us nowcome to a particular explication thereof. Spirits either are divine ministers of theword, and of the Church, and the members thereof ; or else they are servient to theCreatures in corporal things, partly for the salvation of the soul and body, and partlyfor its destruction. And there is nothing done, whether good or evil, without a cer-tain and determinate order and government. He that seeketh after a good end, lethim follow it; and he that desires an evil end, pursueth that also, and that earnestly,from divine punishment, and turning away from the divine will. Therefore let everyone compare his ends with the word of God, and as a touchstone that will judgebetween good and evil; and let him propose unto himself what is to be avoided, andwhat is to be sought after; and that which he constituteth and determineth unto him-self, let him diligently, not procrastinating or delaying, until he attain to hisappointed bound.Aphorism 30.They which desire riches, glory of this world, Magistracy, honours, dignities, tyran-nies, (and that magically) if they endeavour diligently after them, they shall obtainthem, every one according to his destiny, industry, and magical Sciences, as the His-tory of Melesina witnesseth, and the Magicians thereof, who ordained, That none ofthe Italian nation should for ever obtain the Rule or Kingdom of Naples; andbrought it to pass, that he who reigned in his age, to be thrown down from his seat:so great is the power of the guardian or tutelar Angels of Kingdoms of the world.Aphorism 31.Call the Prince of the Kingdom, and lay a command upon him, and command whatthou wilt, and it shall be done, if that Prince be not again absolved from his obedi-ence by a succeeding Magician. Therefore the Kingdom of Naples may be againrestored to the Italians, if any Magician shall call him who instituted this order, andcompel him to recal his deed; he may be compelled also, to restore the secret powers"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"23taken from the treasury of Magick; A Book, a Gemme, and magical Horn, whichbeing had, any one may easily, if he will, make himself the Monarch of the world.But Judæus chused rather to live among Gods, until the judgement, before the transi-tory good of this world; and his heart is so blinde, that he understandeth nothing ofthe God of heaven and earth, or thinketh more, but enjoyeth the delights of thingsimmortal, to his own eternal destruction. And he may be easier called up, then theAngel of Plotinus in the Temple of Isis.Aphorism 32.In like manner also, the Romans were taught by the Sibyls books; and by that meansmade themselves the Lords of the world, as Histories witness. But the Lords of thePrince of a Kingdom do bestow the lesser Magistracies. He therefore that desireth tohave a lesser office, or dignity, let him magically call a Noble of the Prince, and hisdesire shall be fulfilled.Aphorism 33.But he who coveteth contemptible dignities, as riches alone, let him call the Prince ofriches, or one of his Lords, and he shall obtain his desire in that kinde, whereby hewould grow rich, either in earthly goods, or merchandize, or with the gifts of Princes,or by the study of Metals, or Chymistry: as he produceth any president of growingrich by these means, he shall obtain his desire therein.Aphorism 34.All manner of evocation is of the same kinde and form, and this way was familiar ofold time to the Sibyls and chief Priests. This in our time, through ignorance andimpiety, is totally lost; and that which remaineth, is depraved with infinite lyes andsuperstitions.Aphorism 35.The humane understanding is the onely effecter of all wonderful works, so that it bejoyned to any Spirit; and being joyned, she produceth what she will. Therefore we arecarefully to proceed in Magick, lest that Syrens and other monsters deceive us, whichlikewise do desire the society of the humane soul. Let the Magician carefully hidehimself alwaies under the wings of the most High, lest he offer himself to bedevoured of the roaring Lion; for they who desire earthly things, do very hardlyescape the snares of the devil."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24The Sixth Septenary.Aphorism 36.Care is to be taken, that experiments be not mixed with experiments; but that everyone be onely simple and several: for God and Nature have ordained all things to acertain and appointed end: so that for examples sake, they who perform cures withthe most simple herbs and roots, do cure the most happily of all. And in this manner,in Constellations, Words and Characters, Stones, and such like, do lie hid the great-est influences or vertues in deed, which are in stead of a miracle. So also are words, which being pronounced, do forthwith cause creatures bothvisible and invisible to yield obedience, aswel creatures of this our world, as of thewatry, aëry, subterranean, and Olympick supercelestial and infernal, and also thedivine. Therefore simplicity is chiefly to be studied, and the knowledge of such simplesis to be sought for from God; otherwise by no other means or experience they can befound out.Aphorism 37.And let all lots have their place decently: Order, Reason and Means, are the threethings which do easily render all learning aswell of the visible as invisible creatures.This is the course of Order, That some creatures are creatures of the light; others, ofdarkness: these are subject to vanity, because they run headlong into darkness, andinthral themselves in eternal punishments for their rebellion. Their Kingdom ispartly very beautiful in transitory and corruptible things on the one part, because itcannot consist without some vertue and great gifts of God; and partly most filthy andhorrid to be spoken of, because it aboundeth with all wickedness and sin, idolatry,contempt of God, blasphemies against the true God and his works, worshippers ofdevils, disobedience towards Magistrates, seditions, homicides, robberies, tyranny,adulteries, wicked lusts, rapes, thefts, lyes, perjuries, pride, and a covetous desire ofrule; in this mixture consisteth the kingdom of darkness: but the creatures of the lightare filled with eternal truth, and with the grace of God, and are Lords of the wholeworld, and do reign over the Lords of darkness, as the members of Christ. Betweenthese and the other, there is a continual war, until God shall put an end to their strife,by his last judgement.Aphorism 38.Therefore Magick is twofold in its first division; the one is of God, which hebestoweth on the creatures of light; the other also is of God, but as it is the gift whichhe giveth unto the creatures of darkness: and this is also two-fold: the one is to agood end, as when the Princes of darkness are compelled to do good unto the crea-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"25tures, God enforcing them; the other is for an evil end, when God permitteth such topunish evil persons, that magically they are deceived to destruction; or, also he com-mandeth such to be cast out into destruction. The second division of Magick is, that it bringeth to pass some works with visi-ble instruments, through visible things; and it effecteth other works with invisibleinstruments by invisible things; and it acteth other things, aswel with mixed means,as instruments and effects. The third division is, There are some things which are brought to pass by invo-cation of God alone: this is partly Prophetical, and Philosophical; and partly, as itwere Theophrastical. Other things there are, which by reason of the ignorance of the true God, aredone with the Princes of Spirits, that his desires may be fulfilled; such is the work ofthe Mercurialists. The fourth division is, That some exercise their Magick with the good Angelsin stead of God, as it were descending down from the most high God: such was theMagick of Baalim. Another Magick is, that which exerciseth their actions with the chief of the evilSpirits; such were they who wrought by the minor Gods of the heathens. The fifth division is, That some do act with Spirits openly, and face to face;which is given to few: others do work by dreams and other signs; which the ancientstook from their auguries and sacrifices. The sixth division is, That some work by immortal creatures, others by mortalCreatures, as Nymphs, Satyrs, and such-like inhabitants of other elements, Pigmies,&c. The seventh division is, That the Spirits do serve some of their own accord,without art; others they will scarce attend, being called by art. Among these species of Magick, that is the most excellent of all, which depen-deth upon God alone. The second, Them whom the Spirits do serve faithfully oftheir own accord. The third is, that which is the property of Christians, whichdependeth on the power of Christ which he hath in heaven and earth.Aphorism 39.There is a seven-fold preparation to learn the Magick Art.The first is, to meditate day and night how to attain to the true knowledge ofGod, both by his word revealed from the foundation of the world; as also by the sealof the creation, and of the creatures; and by the wonderful effects which the visibleand invisible creatures of God do shew forth. Secondly it is requisite, that a man descend down into himself, and chiefly studyto know himself; what mortal part he hath in him, and what immortal; and what partis proper to himself, and what diverse. Thirdly, That he learn by the immortal part of himself, to worship, love and fearthe eternal God, and to adore him in Spirit and Truth; and with his mortal part, to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"26do those things which he knoweth to be acceptable to God, and profitable to hisneighhours. These are the three first and chiefest precepts of Magick, wherewith let everyone prepare himself that covets to obtain true Magick or divine wisdom, that he maybe accounted worthy thereof, and one to whom the Angelical creatures willingly doservice, not occultly onely, but also manifestly, and as it were face to face. Fourthly, Whereas every man is to be vigilant to see to what kinde life he shallbe called from his mothers wombe, that every one may know whether he be born toMagick, and to what species thereof, which every one may perceive easily that read-eth these things, and by experience may have success therein; for such things andsuch gifts are not given but onely to the low and humble. In the fifth place we are to take care, that we understand when the Spirits areassisting us, in undertaking the greatest business; and he that understands this, it ismanifest, that he shall be made a Magician of the ordination of God; that is, such aperson who useth the ministery of the Spirits to bring excellent things to pass. Here,as for the most part, they sin, either through negligence, ignorance, or contempt, orby too much superstition; they offend also by ingratitude towards God, wherebymany famous men have afterwards drawn upon themselves destruction: they sin alsoby rashness and obstinacy; and also when they do not use their gifts for that honor ofGod which is required, and do prefer [illegible Greek].1 Sixthly, The Magitian hath need of faith and taciturnity, especially, that he dis-close no secret which the Spirit hath forbid him, as he commanded Daniel to sealsome things, that is, not to declare them in publick; so as it was not lawful for Paul tospeak openly of all things which he saw in a vision. No man will believe how much iscontained in this one precept. Seventhly, In him that would be a Magician, there is required the greatest jus-tice, that he undertake nothing that is ungodly, wicked or unjust, nor to let it oncecome in his minde; and so he shall be divinely defended from all evil. Aphorism 40.When the Magician determineth with himself to do any incorporeal thing eitherwith any exteriour or interiour sense, then let him govern himself according to theseseven subsequent laws, to accomplish his Magical end. The first Law is this, That he know that such a Spirit is ordained unto him fromGod; and let him meditate that God is the beholder of all his thoughts and actions;therefore let him direct all the course of his life according to the rule prescribed in theword of God. Secondly, Alwaies pray with David, Take not thy holy Spirit from me; andstrengthen me with thy free Spirit; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from1."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"27evil: I beseech thee, O heavenly Father, do not give power to any lying Spirit, as thou didstover Ahab that he perished; but keep me in thy truth. Amen. Thirdly, Let him accustome himself to try the Spirits, as the Scripture admon-isheth; for grapes cannot be gathered of thorns: let us try all things, and hold fast thatwhich is good and laudable, that we may avoid every thing that is repugnant to thedivine power. The fourth is, To be remote and cleer from all manner of superstition; for this issuperstition, to attribute divinity in this place to things, wherein there is nothing atall divine; or to chuse or frame to our selves, to worship God with some kinde ofworship which he hath not commanded: such are the Magical ceremonies of Satan,whereby he impudently offereth himself to be worshipped as God. The fifth thing to be eschewed, is all worship of Idols, which bindeth any divinepower to idols or other things of their own proper motion, where they are not placedby the Creator, or by the order of Nature: which things many false and wicked Mag-itians faign. Sixthly, All the deceitful imitations and affections of the devil are also to beavoided, whereby he imitateth the power of the creation, and of the Creator, that hemay so produce things with a word, that they may not be what they are. Whichbelongeth onely to the Omnipotency of God, and is not communicable to the crea-ture. Seventhly, Let us cleave fast to the gifts of God, and of his holy Spirit, that wemay know them, and diligently embrace them with our whole heart, and all ourstrength.Aphorism 41.We come now to the nine last Aphorismes of this whole Tome; wherewith we will,the divine mercy assisting us, conclude this whole Magical Isagoge. Therefore in the first place it is to be observed, what we understand by Magitianin this work. Him then we count to be a Magitian, to whom by the grace of God. the spiri-tual essences do serve to manifest the knowledge of the whole universe, & of thesecrets of Nature contained therein, whether they are visible or invisible. Thisdescription of a Magitian plainly appeareth, and is universal. An evil Magician is he, whom by the divine permission the evil Spirits do serve,to his temporal and eternal destruction and perdition to deceive men, and draw themaway from God; such was Simon Magus, of whom mention is made in the Acts of theApostles, and in Clemens; whom Saint Peter commanded to be thrown down upon theearth, when as he had commanded himself, as it were a God, to be raised up into theair by the unclean Spirits. Unto this order are also to be referred all those who are noted in the two Tablesof the Law; and are set forth with their evil deeds."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"28The subdivisions and species of both kindes of Magick, we will note in theTomes following. In this place it shall suffice, that we distinguish the Sciences, whichis good, and which is evil: Whereas man sought to obtain them both at first, to hisown ruine and destruction, as Moses and Hermes do demonstrate.Aphorism 42.Secondly, we are to know, That a Magitian is a person predestinated to this workfrom his mothers wombe; neither let him assume any such great things to himself,unless he be called divinely by grace hereunto, for some good end; to a bad end is,that the Scripture might be fulfilled, It must be that offences will come; but wo be to thatman through whom they come. Therefore, as we have before oftentimes admonished,With fear and trembling we must live in this world. Notwithstanding I will not deny, but that some men may with study and dili-gence obtain some species of both kindes of Magick if it may be admitted. But heshall never aspire to the highest kindes thereof; yet if he covet to assail them, he shalldoubtless offend both in soul and body. Such are they, who by the operations of falseMagicians, are sometimes carried to Mount Horch, or in some wilderness, or desarts[deserts]; or they are maimed in some member, or are simply torn in pieces, or aredeprived of their understanding; even as many such things happen by the use thereof,where men are forsaken by God, and delivered to the power of Satan.The Seventh Septenary.Aphorism 43.The Lord liveth, and the works of God do live in him by his appointment wherebyhe willeth them to be; for he will have them to use their liberty in obedience to hiscommands, or disobedience thereof. To the obedient, he hath proposed theirrewards; to the disobedient he hath propounded their deserved punishment. There-fore these Spirits of their freewil, through their pride and contempt of the Son ofGod, have revolted from God their Creator, and are reserved unto the day of wrath;and there is left in them a very great power in the creation; but notwithstanding it islimited, and they are confined to their bounds with the bridle of God. Therefore theMagitian of God, which signifies a wise man of God, or one informed of God, is ledforth by the hand of God unto all everlasting good, both mean things, and also thechiefest corporal things. Great is the power of Satan, by reason of the great sins of men. Therefore alsothe Magitians of Satan do perform great things, and greater then any man wouldbelieve: although they do subsist in their own limits, nevertheless they are above allhumane apprehension, as to the corporal and transitory things of this life; which"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"29many ancient Histories, and daily Examples do testitie. Both kindes of Magick aredifferent one from the other in their ends: the one leadeth to eternal good, and usethtemporal things with thanksgiving; the other is a little sollicitous about eternalthings; but wholly exerciseth himself about corporal things, that he may freely enjoyall his lusts and delights in contempt of God and his anger.Aphorism 44.The passage from the common life of man unto a Magical life, is no other but asleep, from that life; and an awaking to this life; for those things which happen toignorant and unwise men in their common life, the same things happen to the will-ing and knowing Magitian. The Magitian understandeth when the minde doth meditate of himself; hedeliberateth, reasoneth, constituteth and determineth what is to be done; heobserveth when his cogititions do proceed from a divine separate essence, and heproveth of what order that divine separate essence is. But the man that is ignorant of Magick, is carried to and fro, as it were in warwith his affections; he knoweth not when they issue out of his own minde, or areimpressed by the assisting essence; and he knoweth not how to overthrow the coun-sels of his enemies by the word of God, or to keep himself from the snares anddeceits of the tempter.Aphorism 45.The greatest precept of Magic is, to know what every man ought to receive for hisuse from the assisting Spirit, and what to refuse: which he may learn of the Psalmist,saying, Wherewith shall a yong man cleanse his way? in keeping thy word, Oh Lord. Tokeep the word of God, so that the evil one snatch it not out of the heart, is the chief-est precept of wisdom. It is lawful to admit of, and exercise other suggestions whichare not contrary to the glory of God, and charity towards our neighbours, not inquir-ing from what Spirit such suggestions proceed: But we ought to take heed, that weare not too much busied with unnecessary things according to the admonition ofChrist; Martha, Martha, thou art troubled about many things; but Mary hath chosen thebetter part, which shall not be taken from her. Therefore let us alwaies have regard untothe saying of Christ, Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all thesethings shall be added unto you. All other things, that is, all things which are due to themortal Microcosme, as food, raiment, and the necessary arts of this life.Aphorism 46.There is nothing so much becometh a man, as constancy in his words and deeds, andwhen the like rejoyceth in his like; there are none more happy then such, because theholy Angels are conversant about such, and possess the custody of them: on the con-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"30trary, men that are unconstant are lighter then nothing, and rotten leaves. We chusethe 46 Aphorisme from these. Even as every one governeth himself, so he allurethunto himself Spirits of his nature and condition; but one very truely adviseth, that noman should carry himself beyond his own calling, lest that he draw unto himselfsome malignant Spirit from the uttermost parts of the earth, by whom either he shallbe infatuated and deceived, or brought to final destruction. This precept appearethmost plainly: for Midas, when he would convert all things into gold, drew up such aSpirit unto himself, which was able to perform this; and being deceived by him, hehad been brought to death by famine, if his foolishness had not been corrected by themercy of God. The same thing happened to a certain woman about Franckford atOdera, in our times, who would scrape together & devour mony of any thing. Wouldthat men would diligently weigh this precept, and not account the Histories ofMidas, and the like, for fables; they would be much more diligent in moderating theirthoughts and affections, neither would they be so perpetually vexed with the Spiritsof the golden mountains of Utopia. Therefore we ought most diligently to observe,that such presumptions should be cast out of the minde, by the word, while they arenew; neither let them have any habit in the idle minde, that is empty of the divineword.Aphorism 47.He that is faithfully conversant in his vocation, shall have also the Spirits constantcompanions of his desires, who will successively supply him in all things. But if hehave any knowledge in Magick, they will not be unwilling to shew him, and famil-iarly to converse with him, and to serve him in those several ministeries, unto whichthey are addicted; the good Spirits in good things, unto salvation; the evil Spirits inevery evil thing, to destruction. Examples are not wanting in the Histories of thewhole World; and do daily happen in the world. Theodosius before the victory ofArbogastus, is an example of the good; Brute before he was slain, was an example ofthe evil Spirits, when he was persecuted of the Spirit of Cæsar, and exposed to pun-ishment, that he slew himself, who had slain his own Father, and the Father of hisCountry.Aphorism 48.All Magick is a revelation of Spirits of that kinde, of which sort the Magick is; sothat the nine Muses are called, in Hesiod, the ninth Magick, as he manifestly testifiesof himself in Theogony. In Homer, the genius of Ulysses in Psigiogagia. Hermes, theSpirits of the more sublime parts of the minde. God revealed himself to Moses in thebush. The three wise men who came to seek Christ at Jerusalem, the Angel of theLord was their leader. The Angels of the Lord directed Daniel. Therefore there isnothing whereof any one may glory; For it is not unto him that willeth, nor unto himthat runneth; but to whom God will have mercy, or of some other spiritual fate. From"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"31hence springeth all Magick, and thither again it will revolve, whether it be good orevil. In this manner Ta ge s the first teacher of the Magick of the Romanes, gushed outof the earth. Diana of the Ephesians shewed her worship, as if it had been sent fromheaven. So also Apollo. And all the Religion of the Heathens is taken from the sameSpirits; neither are the opinions of the Sadduces, humane inventions.Aphorism 49.The conclusion therefore of this Isagoge is the same which we have above already spo-ken of, That even as there is one God, from whence is all good; and one sin, to wit,disobedience, against the will of the commanding God, from whence comes all evil;so that the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom, and the profit of all Magick; forobedience to the will of God, followeth the fear of God; and after this, do follow thepresence of God and of the holy Spirit, and the ministery of the holy Angels, and allgood things out of the inexhaustible treasures of God. But unprofitable and damnable Magick ariseth from this; where we lose the fearof God out of our hearts, and suffer sin to reign in us, there the Prince of this world,the God of this world beginneth, and setteth up his kingdom in stead of holy things,in such as he findeth profitable for his kingdom; there, even as the spider taketh theflye which falleth into his web, so Satan spreadeth abroad his nets, and taketh menwith the snares of covetousness, until he sucketh him, and draweth him to eternalfire: these he cherisheth and advanceth on high, that their fall may be the greater. Courteous Reader, apply thy eyes and minde to the sacred and profane Histo-ries, & to those things which thou seest daily to be done in the world, and thou shaltfinde all things full of Magick, according to a two-fold Science, good and evil, whichthat they may be the better discerned, we will put here their division and subdivision,for the conclusion of these Isagoges; wherein every one may contemplate, what is tobe followed, and which to be avoided, and how far it is to be labored for by every one,to a competent end of life and living."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"32FINIS.Theosophy •Knowledge of the Word of God, andruling ones life according to the wordof God. •Knowledge of the government of Godby Angels, which the Scripture callethwatchmen; and to understand themystery of Angels.
