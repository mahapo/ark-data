It is hard to see how any modern magician can deemthemselves traditional without approaching this head on, yet from 1875 to the present thishas hardly been attempted at all. A post Mathers/Crowley stereotype has prevailed, ofGoetic magic as the conjuring of obscurely named entities by a stereotyped process, wherethe identities and origins of the spirits are less important than rampant bibliophilia and an unexaminedadoption of 19th century fallacies. The importance of understanding the spirits and their origins hasbeen overlooked, even substituted for, by jokey adoption of fictional gobbledy gook. Simultaneously,a mock medieval methodology – shaped by unreconstructed colonialism and ‘middle class revulsion’in the early revival period – has blighted our appreciation of the most legitimate and continuousstrand in all of Western magic. Which is exactly what Goetic magic is; a primal inheritance retainingmillennia of experience and tradition; which if properly understood would regenerate Western magicand underline its immense cultural significance, on a level equal to any spiritual tradition in theworld.Talking of myth, in the inception of this rather curious book there was more than one incident of aprinciple arising in Geosophia, namely elastic geography. This principle or characteristic of mythicthinking takes various forms. In particular, regarding Saint Cyprian, there is the case of the two citiesof Antioch. One in Syria built by the Seleucids, at times the most important city of the Roman Empire.The other in Asia Minor, Pisidia to be precise, famed for its precinct of Hecate and Mēn. Both wereimportant, and in mythic geography possibly not as distinct as in geographical space. After all, SaintCyprian of Carthage was and is prone to sharing iconography and other assets with our Cyprian. Ifthis inter-changeability is to be accepted amongst folk saints, why should two cities not coincide inthe popular imagination, or indeed in mine? The reader will therefore hopefully excuse me if despitecommenting on Saint Cyprian I focus rather more on Syria in this volume, after serving Asia Minorwell in the previous two.Saints and Syria have rather a history after all. Notably there was Saint Paul, who, under the nameSaul was a persecutor of the early Christians. He was famously struck temporarily blind on his wayto Damascus, capital of modern Syria, and transformed into the Apostle Paul. The circumstances ofthis transformation are noteworthy; he exchanged a Jewish name for a Roman when travelling out ofJudea into Syria. There is a variety of opinion regarding Paul; some speak disparagingly of Paulianitywhen describing the politicised Church. On the other hand at least one grimoire bears his name, andmany Gnostic sects were favourably disposed to his teachings. Certain ‘de-Hellenising’ elements ofmodern Protestantism – inimical to Platonising theology – might be described as wishing to transformtheir names in the other direction, and hurry back from Damascus forthwith.My invitation to the reader is to travel at first in the opposite direction, to proceed as it were fromDamascus to Antioch. Not in order to espouse any early, middle or neo form of Platonism; only togaze briefly upon what may be called low Platonism.This phrase represents the continuum between Orphics, from whom Plato borrowed many imagesand mythic concepts, and the later magicians of the papyri who were familiar with Platonic concepts,but more practically oriented. That he borrowed from them before they did so from him excuses thefact that magicians are not necessarily philosophers. However, in reviewing the heritage of magic itis often useful to examine the philosophical species and their notions without necessarily convertingto their camp. This can be achieved, as outlined in earlier volumes; by bearing in mind thateschatology precedes philosophy and theology as the defining principle of magic and popular"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ireligion.It is only necessarily to gaze briefly upon it, since though its name is unfamiliar, low Platonism iseasy to recognise. It has been covertly foisted upon us for some time. The ingrained habit of goingthrough the motions with generic Qabalah (partly inherited from Renaissance Neoplatonists) has beena substitute for a reappraisal of Platonic concepts underlying our magical tradition; whilst retainingmuch that originates with it.We have become oblivious to the fact that many of us are low Platonists, in a great variety of waysboth practical and theoretical. The point is, as begun in Geosophia, to delve beneath the ‘hosttraditions’ and reclaim archaic Goetia. To not be, so to speak, low Platonic but to get sub-Platonic.CREDERE CUM CURAN THIS BOOK one endeavour is to confront various issues arising from the role of Christianity inmagic, redressing certain perceptions and imbalances. This will be controversial, and hopefullyenlightening, for believers and non-believers alike.Among the issues involved, indeed perhaps the most important, are omissions formerly introducedinto Western spirituality. Prohibitions relating to animistic beliefs and practices, concerning trees,streams, stones &c. were introduced in the post pagan period. So too, as discussed in previousworks, many former ways of relating to the dead were largely eradicated. These omissions, asperhaps most will concede, do not serve magical practice well.Where Western magic reflects these theological amputations, it contrasts strongly with othertraditions worldwide; the result is not a unique and superior form, but a greatly reduced one. What isperhaps not fully appreciated is that these omissions do not characterise all forms of Christian magiccurrently extant. In the ‘Africanised’ forms of Christianity, many of which involve rich magicaltraditions, such elements are not omitted but remain central. In effect this means that such omissionsare not necessarily characteristic of Christian magic. Although historically European cultureunderwent this particular socio-political purging, the process may be reversed within a Christianmagical paradigm.In addition, we must ask ourselves what exactly this paradigm is. For example, the role ofeschatological matters in the development of magic leads to the question, what is Christianeschatology? It may surprise many of my readers to learn that there is no simple answer to this. In facttwo radically contrasting eschatological conceptions can be detected throughout the history ofChristianity.One of these is thoroughly Platonist, with or without incorporating additional elements fromNeoplatonism. The impression that these elements only entered Christian magic during theRenaissance is a false one; many of the Church Fathers were sympathetic to Platonism, or evencommitted to it. Platonic eschatology melds readily with approaches as seemingly disparate as theGreek magical papyri and New World traditions influenced by Kardecian Spiritism, as well as thegrimoires and Renaissance Cabalism. Any attempt to depict these as inherently non-Christian isbound to fail. While non-Christian forms may exist, the underlying elements of Platonism still makefor compatibility and potential synthesis. At the same time of course this model was not originallyChristian, so such an orientation is not essential to it either.The relationship of magic with Christianity is a thorny subject in some circles and the source ofsome disconcerting attitudes. On the one hand I have personally witnessed Wiccans sneering at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Oimages of saints in a Hoodoo botanica. These were oblivious to possible charges of racism, not tomention ignorance of vibrant magical traditions; which smacks also of complacency. One – with nosense of irony – charged the shop-holders with bigotry, presumably for not subscribing to his beliefs.This is by no means true of all witches however. On the other hand there are many grimoire magicianswho, while reverential of Renaissance magic, are impervious to the respect the Renaissancemagicians had for Classical lore. Not to mention the origins of grimoire practice in the magicalpapyri and ancient Neo-platonism, and magical astrology in Sabeanism and the Chaldean astrologicalmagic of the Seleucid Empire.To return to witches however, although there are obvious similarities with some of the modernmagical practices carried out by Wiccans, most of the methods and techniques used by the old-timewitches bear little resemblance to those used by today’s neo-pagan witches. Often the cunning folkpractised dual faith observance and the charms, amulets, prayers and incantations they used invokedJesus, the Virgin Mary, the Trinity and the company of saints. Psalms were used for magical purposesas spells and they still are in some modern traditional witchcraft circles. With the coming of the newfaith of Christianity and the suppression of the ancient pagan religions, objects such as crucifixes,saints’ medallions, the host and holy water were widely used by folk magicians because they werebelieved to possess ‘virtue’ or magical energy and inherent healing power.Christian symbolism was used in folk magic rituals involving psychic protection, counter-magicand healing. Many of the old pagan charms were Christianised and some of the saints took on theearlier attributes of Pagan gods and goddesses. Sacred springs previously dedicated to goddesses forinstance were re-dedicated either to the Virgin Mary or to female saints such as Winefrede or Bride.Healing charms replaced the names of pagan deities such as Woden, Loki and Thor with those ofGod, Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Many of the grimoires used by witches and the practitioners of folkmagic also inevitably contained Judeo-Christian symbolism.Some modern traditional witches still follow dual faith observance using the psalms for magicalpurposes, working with the company of saints and employing Christian imagery, symbolism andliturgy, often in a heretical and subversive way. The neo-Pagan witch speaks of ways that harm none,while the modern traditional witch – in common with the witches and cunning folk of the past – canboth cure and curse as the need arises. Here the magic, while Christian, is undoubtedly authenticrather than a romantic revival. Similar practices can be found in Vodou, Hoodoo, Santeria, Macumba,Ju-ju and Obeah in the Americas and in Africa. A Catholic model of the universe, including heaven,purgatory and the underworld, influenced Congolese acceptance and use of Catholicism in theirmagical practices, such as Palo Mayombe. It is just as useful in Western necromancy.QUI EST SUMMUS DEI?NE PROBLEM in envisioning Western magical tradition coherently is that the decisive formativerole of an occult synthesis in the ancient world is either not properly understood, or notconsidered in various artificial reconstructions. So too the major role of late paganmonotheism in this period is often unsuspected; leading to unnecessary disconnections of neo-Paganism with ritual magic, where its influence is more integral via literary sources. I stressunnecessary, as the needs of neo-Paganism and of ritual magic, Christian or otherwise, are servedequally by the historical models here employed.Let us take neo-Paganism based on Babylonian tradition. A ‘Jovist’ model often applies here,centred on Marduk as King of the gods. Marduk’s pre-eminence however was in an earlier period"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Uthan the synthesis, starting BCE, while the great synthesis underlying occultism is more 2nd to 4thcentury CE. The highest Chaldean god of this late period is Zervan. Marduk – chief god in an earlierBabylonian phase – is in this period a planetary deity, while the time god – Zervan – embodied theentire astrological system.Interaction between Chaldeans and Persians lent some forms of Zervan the attributes of AhuraMazda (eternity being above dualism). He is thus a ‘pagan’ supreme god, one of several; among them– from a contemporary gentile perspective – was a god known as Jehovah. The fact that we recognisethis name should not confuse us; there were several competing ideas about the Supreme God, and anyone of them might be intended by the use of any single given name. The varying ideas held bycontemporary Jews and Gentiles about a Supreme God are embedded in magical rituals of thesynthesis period, and leave strong traces in the rites descended from them. On occasion, as will bediscussed further on, Sabaoth is the name of the supreme deity, a conception concerned with EternalTime. Elsewhere, as in PGM VII.1012–13, Sabaoth is portrayed differently, as first of four archangels,the others being Michael, Raphael and Gabriel.Such instances represent different conceptions at work, implying more varied ideas thancontemporary readers of the grimoires might consider. Among other things this throws doubt on‘straight Christian Neoplatonism’ as the default structural hierarchy in every grimoire. Havingquestioned that supposed certainty our sub-Platonic method must: assist investigation of traditionsprior to the synthesis; maintain modular coherence in the process of reclamation. This, as will beseen, will involve the Chaldeans.DE MOMENTO CHALDÆORUMNDERSTANDING THE WORLD of Chaldean ideas – who they were influenced by, Persia for instance;who they influenced, virtually everyone in Roman times but especially the Stoics – isimportant for traditional Western magicians. For one thing the most important participant inthe ancient synthesis behind the Western magical tradition, recognised as the single biggest influenceon the grimoires (FR 155), was the Neoplatonist teacher Iamblichus. He was a hereditary Syrianpriest and heavily influenced by the Chaldean Oracles.The trouble is that Chaldean and Babylonian keep changing their meaning. Babylon (as a veryancient city) involves a range of periods and revivals; its religion of course was highly astrological,and its priesthood long lived and influential. The ideas of this priesthood evolved over time, and theyformed intellectual alliances; with first the Stoics and later the Neoplatonists. So naturally ideasabout the gods and the occult basis of the universe changed over time, although earlier phasescontinued to feed in and be reinterpreted to suit later conceptions.Chaldean is also a complex term; among other things for our purposes it can refer to the doctrines ofsaid priesthood, to ancient astrologers confused with them, as well as to tribes and sects in AsiaMinor thought to have similar doctrines or beliefs (for example, the Phrygian Magi or Magusseans,and at least some of the Chalybes).Additionally, Chaldean can refer to the authors of the Chaldean Oracles: two historical persons,Julian the Chaldean and Julian the Theurgist. When Neoplatonist writers used the term Chaldean theymeant these two, not the priesthood or the religion of Chaldea as such.Back to Babylon, it was of course conquered by Persia, whose religion was Zoroastrianism – theprophet of which was associated with magic in the Greek mind. A Persian (more correctly Median)sect known as the Magi – which probably predated Zoroaster – formed another powerful priesthood."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Once Persian and Babylonian priest-hoods and ideas collided with each other all sorts ofcomplexities and confusion came into play. The god of Chaldean astrological thought at its peak wasZervan, a god of time higher than the old planetary gods. In this role he was a candidate for SupremeGod in the cultural ferment of the time. In addition the interplay of Persian and Chaldean thoughtinspired a Zoroastrian ‘heresy’ wherein Zervan rather than Ahura Mazda was supreme.So there are at least two versions of Zervan, one of whom has attributes of Ahura Mazda. In thisguise – like Ahura Mazda – Zervan is beyond the material universe. These models join the One of thePlatonists and all can feed into Jehovah from late antiquity onwards.The ‘regular’ Zervan – a god of eternity but within the created universe rather than without – is stilla much higher conception of god than is Marduk. At this point in history Marduk is one of theplanetary gods below these higher ideas in whatever guise. These planetary gods obviously feed intoour angels and demons, but also into a solar or solunar theology feeding into the synthesis that wasdistinct from the more common fatalistic astrological theology. Both tendencies can be detectedwithin Hermeticism, but the existence of the latter is often under played. The more positive theologymay relate to the earlier competition between Jupiter and the Sun in regional cults, as well as‘Egyptian positivism.’ Naturally the old top god from these more primitive planetary and solartheologies also fed into ideas about God and his Son/Demiurge/Logos. Hence then Pagans mightassert, and Christians deny, that Zeus was another name of the supreme deity; while Jesus, Michaeland Apollo all performed similar roles in various cosmologies.Thus ideas of a Supreme God can draw on a variety of models as they enter Western thought. Thisobviously includes the grimoires which draw on the synthesis of religions and magic occurring in lateantiquity. By the time of the grimoires we may call them all Jehovah, but how he is understood – andhow the magic operates – might resemble Neoplatonist, Zoroastrian or Chaldean forms, or acombination.As you may have gathered I am of the Cumont/Lewy persuasion that Zervanism is centred onBabylonian interpretation of Persian thought. It is certainly the most useful in my own field, but it alsomakes most sense of things overall. Also relevant is that Kronos preceding Chronos etymologically, aChaldean Zervan is more likely to have influenced a Greek god than Greek language influencing aPersian one.This may be a suitable point to mention Zervan’s equivalence with another figure, more familiarperhaps, the so-called gnostic deity Aion. As the high god in Mithraism, we can interpret their modelas Zervanist, having no superior transcendental deity on Platonist or Zoroastrian lines.Zervanism can be seen entering Western magic as early as Pythagoras, via his mentor Pherecydes.This was gently indicated in Geosophia, which is by no means occidentalist in outlook. The emphasiswas simply elsewhere; especially Thracian and Phrygian ecstatic cults and shamanism as influenceson Western magic too often overlooked. The Oriental aspects of Western magic are here explored ingreater detail. The Syrian and Egyptian elements of Theurgy and Hermeticism form a major part of thepresent study; in particular their relation to the models employed in ritual magic of the grimoire type.The origins of the spirit hierarchy are a central aspect of this; especially the Chiefs, Kings andQueens of the spirits. While the main emphasis is upon demons and spirits, a substantial newappraisal of angels is involved, embracing in particular: the Angelic Vice-regent; thwarting angels;the third order angels, with links to the Powers and the thwarting angels; plus kharakteres,particularly as associated with the decans. A product of numerous factors, and itself possessed ofseveral variants, this theme is explored in stages as these are clarified and discussed."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"GRIMOIRE TIMELINEThe following timeline follows the literary tradition and shows the important personalities,movements and events contemporary with the texts.

This ischaracteristic of encyclopædiæ and of compendia; self contained formats which this seriesessentially merges. Thus for example, to take an example from academia, Ogden’s thesis Greekand Roman Necromancy has footnotes while his compendium Magic, Witchcraft and Ghosts, doesnot. Similarly, dictionaries and encyclopædiæ are free of footnotes; they are self-contained sourcesfor reference by definition.Among the works consulted – which of course I list – are such theses as Dodds’ Greeks and theIrrational. To pick a chapter at random, his third has 127 numbered notes, amounting to 19 pages.These typically consist of references to ancient texts, in accepted critical editions and/or the originallanguage; to academic works in German or other languages; quotations wholly or partly in Greek andso on. Such a book – rather than being self contained – requires access to a university library beyondits pages. My compendia on the other hand contain lengthy extracts, in English, from the ancientsources; summaries of the findings of academics in rare editions, regardless of their language; pottedbiographies of important characters &c. So too the series is adapted to the perspective of a practicingmagician; which on occasion provides insights not present in the academic sources employed, norachievable by their methods.Klutz’s Rewriting the Testament of Solomon is an academic work whose format would be next touseless for the non-academic reader, enmeshed as it is in the scholarly conventions of the literaryexegete. His slim text is beyond dense, virtually requiring specialised training to extract the meaningfrom his references. Having suffered these ordeals myself I have no wish to impose them on myreaders; indeed my choice of format might be seen as a conscious reaction against the density anddryness of the research process. The fact is many such works – and their sources – have beenavailable for a long time, and cover areas of major importance to occultism. The fields concernedhave nevertheless been neglected horribly by contemporary magicians throughout my life. It istherefore hard to see how matters would be improved had I reproduced the same formats andconventions.While this compendium requires some effort, and is rather large, the necessary material is gatheredin one place and one language.ABBREVIATIONSANRW Haase, W.

Withthe contraction of the pseudo-scientific and psychological schools, and a partial return totraditional methodologies the historical and practical definitions have crept closer. Themanipulation of spiritual entities to force or guarantee practical results was once taken for granted inacademia, and is now once more fashionable in some occult quarters. So far this return to basics hasstopped short of a reassessment of certain factors underpinning the worldview of magic, at least in theAnglophone world.Meanwhile, academia has largely ceased to automatically perceive magic as degenerate, irrationalor inferior to religion. Not that modern magic is always as deserving of this re-estimation as the oldermagic academia generally concerns itself with.Besides defining what magic is, for example in the eyes of historical persons employing it, there isthe other problem of established usage of magic and cognate terms to enforce negative stereotypes, asin witch-hunts or in demonising the religious practices of others in and outside a given society. Thishas been a complicating factor regarding a clear definition of magic. Over emphasising thedemonising usage has led to definitions where deviance is taken for granted. An influential two pointdefinition assumes this in both categories: there is magic as real or perceived socially deviantreligious practice; and magic as such a practice exploiting supernatural beings. (See D. Aune, ‘Magicin Early Christianity,’ ANRW 1515). In fact accusations of deviance often originate in traditions withtheir own occult practice. This alone should vitiate the necessity to automatically include deviancewhen considering magic as a means of obtaining results from conjuring spirits. The difficulty ofdistinguishing magic from religion, which in some cultural contexts increases to impossibility, alsoopposes such all pervading definitions.Even so, it is well understood, that magic was performed as an undercurrent of varied religiousgroups, particularly as folk religion; and might involve a cleric or other holy man within thecommunity. Deviance comes in various forms, only one of which involves perceived hostile andantisocial persons. Accepted ‘non-deviant’ magical practitioners are plainly part and parcel of somesocieties. Some definitions of deviance involve asserting hegemony, exemplified in our case first byRoman ‘state religion.’ While magic was often problematic, pagan state religion left room for privateand voluntary religious associations distinct from the state cult. These were often closely connectedto magical practices. Under the early Church, these associations also became ‘deviant,’ includingformerly ‘respectable’ magic, such as Theurgy.Another aspect to magical studies that has been subject to change is the relationship of magic andGnosticism. It is now widely understood that the magical practices exemplified by the PGMinfluenced Gnosticism, to which they were historically prior. Not, as once commonly supposed inacademia and contemporary occultism alike, the other way round. It is thus, obviously, quite wrong tospeak of Gnostic gems or Gnostic words of power; these things are the creation of magicians, fromwhom later Gnostics borrowed.Still another aspect of defining magic as distinct from religion (Gnostic or otherwise) is concernedwith the obtaining of results. It is essentially correct for academics to define magic as concerned withguaranteed obtaining of results, as opposed to religiously beseeching a deity who may refuse. Failureto rigorously adhere to a formula was certainly blamed for failures when they occurred, whether ornot every magician genuinely believed that bar this proviso they were infallible. There remains the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"assumption that magic was only concerned with day to day results, while salvation – however it isdefined – was a religious issue; even where said magic was performed within a religious milieu orby a religious official. This, in my opinion, continues to be mishandled both by academics andparticularly occultists, with rare exceptions.There are several complicating factors involved in this misjudgment. One problem may be overcompensation for earlier confusion of the relationship between Gnosticism and magic. That is, havingdefined magic as concerned with results and with Solomonic magic and the PGM prior toGnosticism, such things as ascent rituals are no longer seen as relevant to earlier magic. Rather theunderstanding has grown that Gnosticism had spiritual goals while magic was purely practical. Or,Gnosticism, in common with other religious movements, had an eschatological dimension, magic didnot. There were of course ‘magical religions’ like Theurgy, where a spiritual dimension was super-added by philosophers; the earlier goetic magic providing materials was then devalued as lacking it.Such tendencies subsequently led to ‘high magic’ movements, distinguishing themselves fromwitchcraft, Goetia or ‘low magic,’ along sociological and other lines. However, Lewy’s work onTheurgy strongly implies that the eschatology of Theurgy was not an outright addition; it was merelyredefined in terms of a supreme deity rather than more ‘primitive’ patrons of the deceased.Individual eschatology – beliefs and practices concerning what happens, or can happen whenindividuals die, rather than what happens to everyone on Judgment Day – is directly implied in manyaspects of magical belief. The universalistic apocalypses of Judaism and Christianity have likelyobscured its formative role for occultists and academics alike.Such misconceptions will, in course of time, be seen as wrong headed on several grounds. Aninsightful essay by Morton Smith is worth referencing; ‘Salvation in the Gospels, Paul and theMagical Papyri’ (Helios 13, 1986, 63–74). Therein Smith observes that the day to day concerns ofmagic are directly mirrored by those of religion, priests are consulted regarding the problems ofeveryday life far more often than regarding salvation, which is generally deferred unless old age,disease or some form of insecurity cause it to be emphasised. Distinguishing magic from religion onthe grounds of such an emphasis in the former, while ignoring it in the latter, is obviously specious.The truth is, as Smith eloquently says, that both religion and magic always stock salvation [but] don’tsell much of it. This is not to say that salvation or the afterlife does not utterly underpin theirworldview. As I have expressed elsewhere, these concepts provide motivations and scenarios forspirits to collude with humans and vice versa; an explanation of how and why they do so. Withoutthem spirit magic loses coherence, with them it loses only its two dimensionality.Smith cites texts from the PGM which allude to such beliefs and magical practices directlyinvolving them. These salvationist examples overlap considerably with rites cited by Lewy, assummarised later in ‘A Theurgic Interlude.’ PGM IV.153–221 involves permanent union with a god,involving a ritualised funeral and resurrection. The god appealed to, incidentally, is Typhon, a notinfrequent occurrence. PGM XII.783–806 involves a similar union. These resemble ‘salvation in life’via divine union in a religious context, scarce distinguishable from oneness with Christ.PGM I.143–196 takes us further, not only will the angel/god invoked perform all sorts of[practical, day to day] services for you but when you die, will wrap up the body as befits a godwhile, carrying your spirit, he will bring it into the air with him. For you will not go into Hades,having been established by a powerful familiar as an aerial spirit ... Here a post mortemeschatological context is plainly part and parcel of the pact with the paredros or magical assistant.PGM III.550–90 involves similar hopes, help in life and after it: come to me ... giving me life, health,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"salvation &c. &c ... and after my physical body is well put away, I beseech, Lord, accept this myrequest ... that my spirit be taken up from my bier and come to you, the Lord of all ... begetter ofthe gods &c.So too, understanding the PGM as technical Hermetica gives us pause. The philosophicalHermetica undoubtedly involves salvation (see Copenhaver, Hermetica XXXVII), while the technicalliterature generally deals with more immediate concerns. Both – let it be noted – within the context ofastrological fate. Hermeticism, as the above author notes, originates in a culture – Egyptian – wherereligion and magic were not seen as separate in the least. The same is true, of course, of the Greekmagical papyri. What we call Egyptian religion, which was in fact equally magical, was deeplyconcerned with the afterlife, as is well known. That the PGM includes eschatological conceptionsand goals alongside the day to day magic is more than merely fortuitous.We do not possess a requiem ritual among the papyri, nor should we expect to. On the other hand,where might we expect the magician to be during funeral rites of the communities concerned? Thebelief systems of the above rituals need not contradict the beliefs of such and such a Mystery cultamong whom the operator was numbered. On the contrary, in many cases they are directlycomparable and mutually supportive.Of course Empedocles and Pythagoras, both goetes, were ‘divine men’ whose initiation alsoconcerned post mortem expectations. As prototypes of the less illustrious magicians of late antiquity,as of the equally illustrious Apollonius of Tyana, their example is not reliant on Gnosticism either.Historically, in both folk belief and more literary traditions, the non-dependence of magic onGnosticism does not separate magic from an eschatological context. As a specific form of literarytradition, the papyri, and subsequently the grimoires, are the linear descendents of the Orphicliterature, where eschatological concepts are a given. Day to day results, as exemplified by the PGM,speak volumes about the clientele of a magician, who could be a ‘cleric.’ They tell us comparativelylittle about the motivations of the operator as an individual, or the forming of magical ideas.It is – as mentioned – well understood that magical activity could take place as an undercurrent of agiven religious community; one type of community being the Greco-Roman private religiousassociations. However folk religion influencing local practice of a given religion outside these isequally involved. Thus in Judaism where such associations were not a cultural norm and wereprobably absent, Jewish angelology and demonology nevertheless had an eschatological dimension;as witness the close relationship between Jewish ‘folk’ or ‘magical’ ideas about angels and demonsand the apocalyptic literature. All such communities naturally had eschatological ideas, and the natureof supernatural beings involved in magic is largely determined by that very fact.The increasingly widespread acceptance of Burkert’s thesis, that the goetic magician is a Greekshaman, cannot but have implications herein. The shaman’s role is exemplified by the Orphic journeyinto the underworld to rescue a soul. This underpins the relation of all magic on an earliernecromantic sub-stratum, as emphasised in Geosophia at length. Recuperation of the devalued termsgoetia and necromancy both, leads inexorably to a redefinition of magic. In other words the shaman –or goes – can assist or coerce souls to and fro in the underworld; this leads to ability to questionspirits (necromancy) and to employ them in magic, voluntarily or otherwise. The shaman is on goodterms with powerful spirits of the underworld; able to assist his client, or community, in theirrelations with them.Concern with day to day results, or so called low magic, is thus a subset of a larger belief systemwithin which the magician operates, with or without sanction. This larger belief system is explicitlyeschatological; and religion as distinguished from magic proceeds from it rather than originating it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Primal ‘religion’ is shamanic, shamanism is magic, and therefore the context of magic is wider thanmanipulation of supernatural entities for purely mundane results."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"BOOK ISaint Cyprian"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"TBLUE GRIMOIRES... it was the French Bibliothèque Bleue grimoires that first gave the Caribbean its literary magictradition. Owen Davies, Grimoires: A History of Magic BooksWO TYPES OF GRIMOIRES require distinguishing from one another in order for this study to proceedclearly. There are the manuscripts of the so-called aristocratic angel magic type. Then thereare those which appeared first as printed manuals; exemplified by – but not limited to – theFrench Bibliothèque Bleue genre. Both, to be sure, contain elements from traditions proper tothe other; after all the Fourth Book attributed to Agrippa was an early printed grimoire. Thus,the popular grimoires of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and beyond are replete with authentic elementsof Solomonic lore; likewise the supposedly upper class manuscript tradition is very far from beingdevoid of folk magic elements – or plain sorcery. Features thought proper to one may be found in theother, and vice versa. It should not be automatically assumed that manuscripts outrank blue grimoiresin terms of the traditions they preserve. That many manuscripts postdate the invention of the printingpress should encourage caution in this respect.Nevertheless, there are good reasons for partially distinguishing these types. There is also someirony in the fact that devotees of the angelic genre are occasionally disparaging about the more folksyblue grimoires. One element of this ironic subtext is the fact that the very term grimoire first gainedcurrency through the blue genre: the True Grimoire, the Grand Grimoire and the Grimoire of PopeHonorius all appeared first as printed titles. It is from these that grimoires became a collective termfor magical books. Yet some historians and angel conjurers alike have subsequently sought to excludefrom the canon those very books! They have been described as pulp grimoires, as pseudo-grimoires,or merely sensationalist; among other ways sought to exclude them from proper consideration. Inreality, aficionados of the blue books have a better claim to the grimoire title, since the titles of theirtexts originated the usage. Not that I encourage them to become overly exclusive. However there aregrounds for making distinctions based on something more serious than mere snobbery, inverted orotherwise.The nature of this distinction and its significance for this entire study, concerns differences ofapproach. It has been said, with some justification, that a major thread of Western magic involvescompulsion. In one form this is native to Egyptian tradition, among others. The Books of Moses thatappear in the papyri speak of initiated formulæ of compulsion, not of demons but of time gods. Theseare contemporary forms of older traditions, it is not unknown in various cultures for gods, even saints,to receive rough treatment, being literally or verbally bound included. There is however anotherform, that of the thwarting angel, which is a more problematic form of compulsion traceable to theToS. Compulsion that is, of the demonic realm by the angelic, or the infernal by the celestial. Insofaras elements of Solomonic magic are involved in the blue genre, this may appear to be the case in thelatter also. This is however, largely a matter of mere appearances.In reality the folk aspect of the grimoires in both cases, but particularly the blue books, is ratherdifferent. It involves goetic survivals, and in the case of the blue genre, a virtual Goetic revival. Itsnature is essentially chthonic, and dealings with spirits are performed on a rather different basis."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Whether as survivals of an older methodology and worldview or as a revival this difference does notinvalidate the genre. On the contrary, it marks it as a different tradition – in some respects moreancient – which possesses its own inherent legitimacy.The blue genre obtains this identity through a variety of means, and no one of these is entirelyresponsible. These include firstly, continuity of the Hermetic strand within the Solomonic tradition;wherein elemental demons are viewed more positively. Despite exceptions this is very present in theSolomonic genre too; for example in Liber Juratus and Lansdowne 1203 (the KoS according toAbognazar). Together with other re-emergent themes this pre-existent tendency received a majorboost from the view of elementals in Paracelsian thought. Then, within the blue genre as such, thecauses are classical interests, folk sympathies and outright subversive motivations. In the latter case,most markedly in early modern France, a post revolutionary anti-clerical ethos is at work. OwenDavies’ Grimoires gives a good account of this genre, unimpeded by the Inquisition though still atodds with the public censor. Classical interests can be seen at work in a variety of late grimoires.This involves apparent contradictory elements, seemingly completely overturning what is wronglyassumed to be the one Solomonic view of spirits; yet just as often retaining or even emphasising theirmost diabolical features. Such antique themes as intermediary spirits and spirit messengers reassertthemselves as mainsprings of the methodology. The old nature spirits, often reclassified aselementals, also assert themselves more openly.The demographic or target audience is markedly different from the manuscript tradition ofaristocratic angel magic. Folk sympathies are thus a very major factor; and consequently folkloricelements become more prominent. The socially levelling influence of Paracelsus had played a part;an influence with other ramifications beside. The genre is, as said already, not to be taken for anovelty, so much as a resurgence of older themes. Consciously or not, the old goetic strand and itschthonic centre of gravity are reasserted through these developments.There is then the matter of the new affiliations formed by the genre. While the French grimoires ofthis time had an influence way beyond France, the printed grimoire genre as a whole was to wield aninfluence far beyond Europe. The more kabbalistic Books of Moses certainly influenced Hoodoo inthe United States, but do not particularly concern Saint Cyprian or the Goetic fusions within traditionssuch as Kimbanda. The first is better illustrated by the Iberian grimoires and the latter by the Franco-Italian texts such as the True and Grand Grimoires. As will be seen in the course of examining theBook of Saint Cyprian, there is considerable affinity between these categories.This Book represents one of a wealth of related grimoire literature little known to the WesternOccult Revival (1875–1975). These are only now beginning to claim the collective attention ofmodern occultists. While the True and the Grand Grimoire have long been better known, ifunderestimated until recently, the Iberian end of the blue grimoire spectrum has so far attracted littleattention in the English speaking occult sphere.Too often dismissed as merely derivative, for example of the Grand Grimoire, there is in fact agood deal more to them. As I shall seek to show, these Iberian texts embody the goetic revival abovementioned, in common with the Franco-Italian Bibliothèque Bleue. While they contain much thatappears innovative, in reality our rich tradition has diverse – even competing and contradictory –strands, and does not stand still. So it is that these elements are a resurgence of a theme native to thetradition in other guises. So too their influence on and harmony with thriving living traditions in theNew World is important to recognise. For the purposes of this study then I shall primarily focus ontwo such texts:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Heptameron or Magical Elements composed by the great CyprianThis text bears incidentally no obvious relation to its earlier namesake attributed to Pietro de Abano.While small it contains a good deal of considerable interest.

This estimation may not beexhaustive as the text I have chiefly examined here appears to bear characteristics of both. In this textmuch Grand Grimoire related material, interesting in and of itself, is accompanied by a great dealmore besides. Such of it as is related to the afore mentioned Bibliothèque Bleue grimoire shows signsof meaningful adaptation, perhaps geared towards New World practitioners. Other material isderived from True Black Magic, as well as an alternative version of the variously named BlackPullet. A good deal else bears the hallmarks of authentic Iberian folk magic with a ‘grimoiric’ twist.Both these texts are contributory to and illustrative of various significant trends in modern magicaltraditions outside the English speaking world. On the other hand there is a deliberate universalism atwork; in the remarkable demonology embodied by Chiromancia Astrologíca not least of all."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"WSAINT CYPRIAN OF THE GRIMOIRESHILE MODERN ANGLOPHONE MAGICIANS are perhaps most familiar with the recently published ClavisInferni the name of Saint Cyprian is intimately involved with the entire grimoire tradition.Magical books associated with him have been extant from at least the time of Agrippa:... from the sect of the Goetians have proceeded all those books of darkness, which Vulpianus theLawyer calls books disallowed to be read, and forthwith appointed them to be destroyed, ofwhich sort the first is Zabulus reported to invent, who was given to unlawful arts, then Barnabas acertain Cyprian; and now in these days there are carried about books with feigned titles, under thenames of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Solomon, also Paul, Honorius, Cyprianus, Albertus,Thomas, Hierome, and of a certain man of York, [which] Alphonsus King of Castile, RobertBacon of England, Peter de Abano and many other men of deplored wit have unwisely followed.De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarumAs a pseudonymous magical author in fact Saint Cyprian’s fame compares with that of Solomon. TheGrand Grimoire cites his name, and an Iberian version of the same grimoire was attributed to him.The Enchiridion not only gives an oration attributed to him, but also speaks of him in the rubrics ofother spells and psalms. From this text in particular it becomes clear that in folk Catholicismsurrounding the grimoires the magician saint was routinely honoured and petitioned as a patron andhero. This preceded the adoption – or continuation – of similar practices in New World traditions.Cyprian’s name also appears in Coptic magical papyri and early Christian texts (including prayersand amulets in Greek, Latin, Ethiopic, Arabic and Armenian), making him a truly universal magician.The author of The Confession of Saint Cyprian, which will be examined later, was – as numerousscholars have agreed – familiar with the foundational text of Solomonic magic, namely the Testamentof Solomon. The Confession, a Christian polemical document like the final redaction of theTestament, was addressed to a pagan audience, while the latter was primarily aimed at Jews. Bothtexts will be examined in the course of this study. Through these links and in several other respects,Cyprian functions equally as a pagan magician and a Christian saint; comparable with and yetsuperior to Solomon. There is an ancient Cyprian, a grimoire Cyprian and a New World Cyprian,each of whom appear in various guises.The Saint Cyprian of the grimoire literature is a complex, pan-European figure. What we might termthe Nordic Cyprian of Agrippa is well served by Rankine and Skinner’s text. Even so, The BlackBooks of Elverum provides another view of the Northern Cyprian. Thus we should not be surprisedthat it is in the blue grimoires – as opposed to aristocratic angel magic – that the Iberian Cyprianstands revealed. The populist pedigree of Iberian grimoires links back to the Franco-Italiangrimoires. There is indeed a connection between Saint Cyprian and a spirit of the True Grimoire, tobe explored anon. An examination of the books of Saint Cyprian in Iberian culture is required inadvance of that meeting. Two texts will be chiefly involved in this examination the Book of SaintCyprian and the Magical Elements. My commentary will be interwoven with the text.

This name may be derived from Johannes Sell – aka John Fell – anOxford cleric (1625–1686). A distinguished scholar, publisher and bishop, he wrote a workentitled Saint Cyprian. Subsequently his name became associated with the black books of Norway,which commonly bore the name Cyprianus.Sufurino’s post as librarian of the monastery on the Brocken is significant, for this mountain has along standing association with paganism, magic and witchcraft. The mountain in question is situatedin the Harz range and is the highest in Northern Germany. It is reputed to have been the site of Odinworship until the time of Charlemagne, and a large image of the god is said to have been found there.In Goethe’s Faust it is the scene of a Witches’ Sabbat on Walpurgisnacht which the magician attendswith Mephistopheles. In this way the grimoire establishes Faustian as well as Solomonic credentialsfor itself, and sets the scene for events to be described in the course of the introduction. The sabbaticassociations are appropriate for other reasons, as will become clear in the course of examining thegrimoire itself.To the faithful readerHERE PRESENT a book to you of inestimable value, Complete Treatise of True Magic, written by theGerman monk, Jonas Sufurino. My liking for this sort of work has always led me to searchcarefully through piles of old books; labouring to find something beyond the small numberfamiliar in this regard. After many years of fatiguing investigations my efforts have been rewarded.The finding of Complete Treatise of True Magic filled me with immense satisfaction.I found it among others of different species, in the small bookstore of a village priest. It was writtenin German, a language completely unintelligible to me. However, through some figures in the text andby some names sprinkled here and there, I deduced that the strange opuscule dealt with Magic. Alearned scholar translated it lucidly, undertaking his work with extreme scrupulousness. On readingthe translation, I saw that this small book is really most notable. Composed by the German monkJonas Sufurino; the librarian of the monastery on the Brocken – that mountain where, according to oldlegend, the devils and sorceresses celebrated his Sabbats and the dance macabre – turned out to be atreasure of true magic.In this small book is contained, indeed, more essentials than is usual in such works: The Book ofSaint Cyprian; the Clavicle of Solomon; invocations, pacts and exorcisms; the Black Hen orSchool of Sorceries; the Grand Grimoire or the pact of blood; magical Candle to discoverenchantments; Compilation of Chaldean and Egyptian magic; philtres, enchantments, witchcraftand sorceries.Revealing this much, one may comprehend that this is a treatise of exceptional importance; if onestudies with true diligence many useful and beneficial things can be learned.

Theyhave shown this book to me, written on immaculate parchment in Hebrew characters. I declare tothe whole world that what is contained in this book is true. I was an unbeliever, but the evidenceremoved me from my error. Devoted from boyhood to the study of sciences, when I grew to be a manthere was no knowledge that I had not plumbed. But at the heart of all of this I found emptiness. Mysoul was shaken, thirsting to discover the supreme secret truth. I thus became monk in the monasteryof Mount Brocken, following my inclinations I asked for the librarian position and there, in its vastand ancient library, I isolated myself completely, spending years in the deepest and most mysteriousstudies. There were innumerable volumes there that dealt with the magical arts. The simple reading ofsome of them convinced me that there was yet more to seek. I formed the following reflections: thereis no doubt that there exist good and bad spirits, as there are men. There is no doubt either that thesespirits can appear, since the Devil appeared to the Son of God moments before his death: there is nodoubt that these spirits are equipped with a sovereign intelligence, since the same religion affirmstheir power to touch us, to induce us to or from evil; thus, if by means of magic a man can be put incommunion with these spirits, that man will attain to reach the supreme wisdom. I formed all thesereflections in my solitary cell among the dusty books of my library; but had not become so bold as toput them into practice. I decided, then, to perform them to complete my project.The time came one freezing winter’s night. The sky was covered with enormous dark clouds, whichevery moment were torn asunder by the crimson flare of lightning. The wind shrieked horriblybetween the mountain pines. Rain whipped at the gothic glass of the windows of the monastery. Yetwas I fearless, as my sole thought that night was the promise of my hopes. When all the monks weregathered in their cells, and perhaps asleep, I quietly left the monastery and undertook the march untothe highest peak of the mountain. When I was at the summit, I paused, lightning flashing incessantlyaround my head. My persistent intention was to invoke the Lord of Avernus. The hurricane crashedagainst my body, and twisted my monk’s habit furiously. Yet I remained steady as the rocks beneathmy feet, nor was I intimidated, nor turned from my intent. I judged the moment had come for callingthe devil.If you truly exist, I shouted with a thundering voice, oh, powerful genius of Avernus, showyourself visibly.At that instant, in the midst of a crescendo of the lightning, appeared the infernal spirit that Iinvoked.What do you want of me?I want – I responded to him without hesitation – to enter into relations with you.Granted – it replied, return to your cell. There you will hear from me whenever you wish. I knowwhat you seek, and I will divulge to you all the secrets of this world and the other. I will give abook to you, the catechism of the secret arts, from which all but initiates are excluded.With which words it disappeared, and I returned to the monastery. There I saw my great andmysterious friend whenever it was necessary to me. My purpose was to compose the book that I leaveto posterity; the key of purest gold that opens and deciphers the sovereign arcana of life and of nature,unknown to all incredulous and vulgar persons.

He gave a book to me written in Hebrew characters on virgin parchment,saying:This book, written in Hebrew, is the same one owned by great Cyprian, granted him by me, whencompelled by virtue of a powerful talisman he owned. It served to acquire him the knowledge ofTrue Magic and dominion over both spirits and people. By it he became all-powerful, as you willalso, if you meditate upon and perform whatever this book contains. I must warn that it will not beparted from you; even though you attempt to burn it or cast it into a river, always you will returnto find it in your monkish cell.I was filled with wonder at these words, and I requested satisfaction of my curiosity from him, thathe might explain to me the cause of such a prodigy.It is very simple, he said to me. This book was bathed in the Great Lake of Red Dragons thatexists in my dominions, thus it is impossible that any elements of the universe can destroy it.The leaves cannot be cut nor drilled. Fire is extinguished by its touch and the water cannotharm it.This power resembles the Norwegian Black Books – called Cyprians – which could not be destroyedby fire. The Great Lake of Red Dragons in which a magical book was bathed is strongly reminiscentof themes explored in Geosophia. There it is associated with the Sibyl of a magical mountain, wherethere is a blood red lake. Necromancers undertook pilgrimages to consecrate a magical book bybathing it in the waters. Sufurino’s text has other surprises in store for us.And how do you explain, I responded, that if cast away it returns to its place?You are very inquisitive, but today I will indulge you in everything. This book has betweenits leaves the cabalistic signs of the Red Dragon and the Infernal Goat, or Goat of the Art, andby the magical virtues these possess, will always return to your chamber and accompany youeverywhere, remaining invisible to all save you and those who have made pact with me. Youmay try whatever tests you will and thus observe great wonders.Having said this he disappeared. I was disturbed by hearing these revelations so much so, that Ispent some time paying no account to these events, until finally, it being close to hand, I beganreading it. There was great conflict in me between the fear and the curiosity he had awoken. ThenI remembered that Lucifer said to me it was written in Hebrew, a language scarcely known by me,so already calmer, I turned the first leaf, hoping to find signs that I could not read. Nevertheless itwas not to be so, since to my great wonder I could read the writing perfectly, with equal facilityas if it were a book in my own language. I turned several leaves, upon one I found perfectlydrawn a dragon and a goat calmly laying together. The goat had drawn upon its kneeshieroglyphics that read Arte. As I looked upon this it seemed both strange and yet familiar: but astill greater surprise was awaiting me. The dragon and the goat became enlivened, moving their"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"eyes and increasing in size. Finally, leaving the book, they were prostrated before me; eachspeaking these words in a human voice:I am your servant, command and you will be obeyed.The voice of the goat had a timbre similar to the bleat of a sheep and that of the dragon the grufftones of a bull. I was surprised at their presence, but contemplating the humble attitude of thosebeasts I overcame my weakness and replied to them:I desire nothing immediately; however I wish you to tell me how to call you when needed,and what type of service you can render unto me.The goat, replying for them both, said to me:I am called Barbato and this one is Pruslas; we are under the jurisdiction of Satanachia, ourhead, who assists the great one, emperor Lucifer, and is a great general of his armies. He hassent us to your side to be obedient in everything, whatsoever you command, in accord with thepact made with our sovereign lord. You will constantly have us at your side and it will beenough to name us, to have us both attend to your orders.It is well, I said to them, you may now withdraw.I had not long pronounced these words, when without my knowing how, they disappeared frommy sight ...These two spirits have an interesting pedigree. Barbatos is known from Weyer and the Goetia ofSolomon. Pruslas is listed by Weyer but omitted in both Scot and the Goetia. Since the GrandGrimoire omits Weyer’s descriptions a translation of the source text may be useful here:Pruslas, also called Busas is a great Prince and Duke, he willingly helpeth the evoker in whateveris asked of him. He reigns in the region of the Tower of Babylon, appearing outside it as a flame.His head however is like that of a great screech owl. He willingly promotes strife, war, quarrelsand lies, but may not have access to all places. He responds abundantly to your requests. Hecommands 26 Legions, partly of the Order of Thrones and partly the Order of Angels.The Goetia translation regarding Barbatos being defective, and his role here equally important, thefollowing may also be instructive:Barbatos, a great Count or Earl, and also a Duke commanding 30 legions of devils by hisauthority. His form [image = signo] is that of a hunter in the forest with a bow [sagittariisylvestris], accompanied by four kings and their companies with great trumpets. He understandeththe singing of birds, the barking of dogs, the lowing of bullocks, and the voice of all livingcreatures, which he teacheth. He detecteth treasures hidden by magicians and enchanters and ispartly of the Order of Virtues and partly of Dominations. Thirty legions obey him; he knoweth allthings past, and to come, reconcileth friends and powers.Quite why Barbatos appears with Four Kings may be a little clearer by the end of this volume.The background of these spirits is complimented by reference to their superior, Satanachia. He is adeputy of Lucifer known from the True Grimoire and Grand Grimoire alike. The way the textmythologises and personalises his two subordinates is interesting enough. In the case of Pruslas wemight see this as the beginning of a process; climaxing in his syncretic equivalence with the fullypersonalised Exu de Lodo in Kimbanda. Note regarding Barbatos that a feminine form for goat isused in Cyprian’s text."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"There are other details which should be underlined before moving on. The bestial forms in whichthese spirits appear are totally distinct from the forms in Weyer’s text. A variant of the GrandGrimoire bears the title Red Dragon, while a lake of this name has already been introduced in thetext under examination. Sufurino is undoubtedly connecting these traditions with Pruslas.... Trying to be released from so many emotions, I left to stroll, and as I reflected, it seemed onlynatural that these wonderful events had happened to me. Later, when it was necessary to resort tomy servants and their superior commanders, we could speak amicably, without surprises or fearsof any kind. Preparing carefully for future contingencies, I set out to make a copy of the contentsof the book whose cover bears the legend: Complete treatise of true magic or treasure of themagician. Within is a dedication in the following form:We dedicate this book to the new follower of secret arts, and below these words the signatureof Lucifer. Underneath this dedication was added the following note:I declare that this book has shown the true wisdom to me, obtaining with its study anabsolute superiority over all things, this bore the signature of Cyprian the Magician.The introduction of our grimoire essentially ends here.

Born in Antioch, between Syria and Arabia, of very richand powerful parents, he mastered all the magical arts until at the age of 30 he becamejoined to the religion of Christ ...This account of his origins reflects a traditional conflation of our Saint Cyprian and the historicalBishop of Carthage, who was indeed born in Antioch in Syria rather than Pisidia.

Another useful aspect of the identification of these two figures is to link Cyprian withSyrian traditions as well as those of Asia Minor. A tale of two Cyprians thus becomes a tale of twocities. Both are integral to magical themes concerning the magical Cyprian. Our saintly magusoriginated in a polemical tale of early Christian writings: The Confession of Saint Cyprian. Whereas– as will be seen – the Testament of Solomon was adapted to polemical purposes in disputes with theJews, the target of the Cyprian polemic involved the Neoplatonists and their theurgic magic. Forvarious reasons Syrian Antioch is a convenient geographical symbol of theurgy. From this evolves auseful conceit; rather than accidental confusion with Saint Cyprian of Carthage, purposefulidentification with Iamblichus, leader of the theurgic school of Neoplatonism.... He left countless writings and magical books, the product of his great knowledge and of themany wonders he himself performed in his time as a magician, and that gained him the admirationof all the people. He had a formidable power over the infernal spirits, and they obeyed him in allhis decrees. He was able to bring to fruition the most extraordinary enchantments. He hadabsolute power over the people and the elements. His conversion to Christianity resulted from thefollowing exceptional event: There was in Antioch a Christian maid called Justina, as rich as shewas beautiful, daughter of Edeso and Cledonia. She was educated in their religion, which was ofthe gentiles [pagan]. One day Justina heard the preaching of Frailo, at that time the deacon ofAntioch. Whilst listening, the beautiful ideas of the Christian religion claimed her. Shortly afterthis she secured the conversion of her parents. A youth named Aglaide fell in love with Justinaand asked to take her as his wife, which he could not do, because she had already offered herselfto Jesus Christ. In desperation Aglaide resorted to the Magician Cyprian so that he could bendthis woman, who was so resistant, to his desires. Cyprian applied all his spells and enchantments,invoking the whole company of spirits to his aid. Everything, nevertheless, was useless. Justinaresisted all classes of sorceries, because she was under the protection of the Virgin and helped by"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the divine grace of Jesus. Having in addition made with her right hand the sign of the Cross ofSaint Bartholomew; this alone is efficacious against every class of curse and enchantment. †The Sign of the CrossThe footnote that follows this advice is as follows:† Those that form this cross with the right hand will be free of all class of curses and spells.The Book of Saint Cyprian makes several mentions of the sign of the cross; due partly to the fact it isa compendium these are often contradictory, recommending it as a protective device on one occasion,insisting on its complete absence in another. The legend of the Saint – where his magic is defeated bythe cross – is the obvious source of the references. The legend of course dates from the period whenChristianity and Neoplatonist theurgists were engaged in dispute. This being the case certaincomments of Lewy regarding the cross are particularly interesting. Firstly he alludes to passages fromProclus regarding magical signs, the sign (kharakter) of the human soul consisted of a combination ofsemicircles and the figure X. Other characters are mentioned, synonymous with what modern magicrefers to as sigils. These include the sigils of heroes (including Hercules and Pentheus) and of thesoul of Plato, among others. These characters offer an interesting insight into sigils in the grimoires,since the entities conjured could appear in the form of their sigil. In Lewy’s words they: becamevisible as a geometrical luminous figure. It is from Plato’s Timæus that the Chaldean Theurgistsderived the idea that the World Soul (and by extension human souls) consisted of two semicirclesforming an X. Such exegesis of the philosophical canon was of course consistent with theirmetaphysics; comparable to magical use of qabalistic hermeneutics to interpret scripture. Porphyrysaw a resemblance between an Egyptian symbol, probably the ankh, and the character of the worldsoul (personified in the Chaldean Oracles by Hecate). Christian commentators such as Justin saw aresemblance between the Platonic symbol and the Serpent of Brass hung upon a tau cross mentionedin the Books of Moses. Lewy’s insights make him invaluable to magicians of the present day. Herefers us to a hostile report by Gregory Nazianzen, of the famous theurgist Maximus of Ephesuspresiding over the initiation of the Emperor Julian. These initiations involved apparitions of hostiledemons at each level of descent into the crypt of Hecate, which Maximus fended off by making crosssymbols, apparently as manual gestures. The hostile commentator leaps to the polemical conclusionthat the pagan mage was hypocritically invoking Jesus. Lewy suggests the far more likelyinterpretation that the sign: was in reality the sign of Hecate-Psyche, the mistress of the demons ...this theurgical action would be in complete conformity with the common practice of the magicianswho terrorised the minor spirits by appealing to their superiors. This is worth keeping in mindwhen considering the talismans that appear later. To continue:Cyprian, full of rage when seeing himself overcome by so delicate a creature, rose againstLucifer, and said to him: Oh spirit of Avernus! In what does it reside, that my entire art ishumiliated thus by a weak woman. With as much dominion as you possess, you cannot put herunder my power! Tell me then, what talisman or amulet protects her that prevents my victoryand makes all sorceries useless?Then Lucifer, compelled by divine order, said to him: The God of the Christians is Lord of allCreation, and I, in spite of all my dominion, am subject to His will, no being is able to prevail"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"against one who makes use of the sign of the Cross. By this Justina avoided my temptations.Then being thus – Cyprian said, I immediately apostatise from you and become a disciple ofChrist.Which he did, and in time achieved still more; receiving martyrdom and being counted in thenumber of the saints.As this account shows, the Cyprian of legend was a professional magician. In the main strand oftradition he dwelt in Antioch of Pisidia. His love magic – a major feature of the legend – appears inthe Coptic Christian magical texts. The 4th–5th century Christian poet Prudentius – who confuses thetwo Cyprians and their respective Antiochs – tells of his skill in necromantic spells to breakrelationships as a prelude to seduction. These rites, he tells us, were often practiced amongst thetombs. Other accounts, such as the Confession, describe him calling upon demons, underlining howclosely ideas concerning demons and the lower ranks of the dead were in this critical formativeperiod. So too he is the pseudonymous author of numerous grimoires, as well as prayers andincantations, in which the legendary magician was proficient. His strict diet of plain food, includingacorns, resembles the ascetic and shamanic magicians encountered in my Geosophia.While there is no hard evidence he ever lived, the traditional Christian legend of Saint Cyprian isas follows. There lived in Pisidia a Christian maiden, Justina, whose father was a pagan priest. Sheconverted both him and her mother to Christianity. A rich libertine named Aglaides saw the beautifulmaiden as she frequently came to and from the Church. He desired her but was unable to prevailagainst her Christian chastity.He therefore sought the aid of a famed magus of the city, Cyprian, for assistance. Cyprian was mostproficient in both astrology and necromancy; the one being the art of the neighbouring Chaldeans, andthe other the core of all magic.According to one important form of the legend Cyprian fell in love with the maiden himself and sentdemons to torment her in accord with the aggressive love magic of the period. Another version hashim undertake the work on behalf of his client (the mid 4th century Lives of Saints Cyprian andJustina). In the latter a demon advised him to sprinkle the exterior of her house with a drug(pharmakon), while the demon assailed her mind. This magic proved unavailing, and he conjured amore powerful prince of spirits, with an equal lack of success. The demons tellig him they wereunable to prevail against the sign of the cross which she made in their presence.Cyprian therefore resolved to abandon magic and serve the same God as Justina. She, in thanks atthe conversion of the magician, cut off her hair as a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary (there are echoes inthis of rite of passage rituals in Pagan cults). Cyprian was baptised and became a great pillar of theChurch.When persecution flared up for the last time the governor of the city had them both thrown intoboiling pitch, which by a miracle had no effect. The Emperor Diocletian received them as prisonersat Nicomedia, and had them beheaded. This martyrdom took place on 26th September 304 CE, fromwhich date originates the Saint-day of this famous magician.Ogden (MWG) makes some interesting comparisons of the version in the Lives. The firstcomparison is with the legend of Saint Hilarion, in which a curse tablet is buried under the thresholdof a Christian virgin. More thoroughgoing and far reaching is the comparison with Lucian’sPhilopseudes. While different in terms of attitude and conclusion, there are several affinities. The useof aggressive love magic is certainly one of these. Cyprian thrice sends demons to assail his victim,Lucian’s mage summons first a ghost, next Hecate, Cerberus and the Moon together, then finally"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"makes and despatches an image of the Love god. Other similarities suggest that the story form wastraditional, to both Pagans and Christians. Another parallel story, even more important for ourpurposes, is also cited by Ogden and others. Ogden points to an influential medieval collection calledThe Golden Legend. While this source tells the tale of Cyprian and Justina, it also contains anotherstory. In this a defrocked priest named Theophilus sells his soul to the devil in order to be reinstated.Taken together these tales contributed mightily to the development of the legend of Faust. Thus we arebrought full circle to the finding of the Great Book of Saint Cyprian on Mount Brocken. Accordinglyit is time to leave the fictional Cyprian and introduce the historical figure of Iamblichus."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"ITIAMBLICHUSCertain diviners, among whom Iamblichus can be named, desiring to know who would succeedEmperor Valens, employed alectromancy ...Grimorium Verum: Magical Secrets, Italian editionIamblichus ... was the first systematizer of the occult sciences: it was he, too, who adopted thedoctrines of the Chaldean Oracles and incorporated them into his mysteriosophy to which hegave the name Theurgy.Hans Lewy, Chaldæan Oracles and TheurgyAMBLICHUS IS A GIGANTIC FIGURE whose presence extends through all aspects of this study,eschatological, magical and philosophical. He founded in Syria a Neoplatonist schoolresponsible for crucial developments in Neoplatonist philosophy. Fundamentally, his adoption ofTheurgy – employing material substances in spiritual works – delivered Neoplatonism from thenegative attitude to material creation bequeathed it by Plato. In this respect he is tremendouslyimportant, and for a variety of allied reasons.There are many blanks in our knowledge of Iamblichus, the majority of whose works areunfortunately lost, though much concerning them can be recovered. We do not know very much abouthis life, and it has been assumed that his religious outlook is also unknown. It is my opinion that thislast is also recoverable, or at least that certain assumptions regarding it are both straightforward andpermissible. Further, that evidence for these assumptions may have been inconvenient, and may alsoexplain the loss of so many of his works.It is known that he was born into an affluent family of high repute, who it appears were hereditarypriestly rulers of the Kingdom of Emesa. Indeed his name is shared by many persons connected to thisline, and such a position would explain a good deal about him. For such reasons I wish to spendrather more time discussing his familial and geographical identity than abstruse points of philosophy.Emesa and AntiochHE CITY OF EMESA was located on the Orontes River in western Syria around a hundred miles northof Damascus. As regards the site, the earliest settlement dates to around the middle of the 3rdmillennium BCE. Emesa itself was known to the Classical world and after from the Seleucidperiod in the 1st century BCE. It was to become the capital of the Emesani dynasty, to which familyIamblichus belonged and from which the city takes its name. It was associated with the sun god El-Gabal; such Syrian solar-pantheistic deities were critical to the development of the Sol Invictus cultof ancient Rome. The symbol of this god was a holy stone (see this motif in Geosophia, with itsconnections with both Cybele and Vulcan).Modern Western magic, whether represented by Hermeticism or the more hands-on approach of thegrimoires, originates in the cultural fusion of the Roman Empire. We may point particularly to theEastern Empire, with its roots in the kingdoms of Alexander and his generals. In acknowledging andbuilding upon this historical fact, certain over emphases are nevertheless often assumed.In considering Egyptian and Jewish elements in magic, the city of Alexandria appears to be a"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"natural focus. There are various reasons why this is misleading. First and foremost, there is themodern understanding that ancient magical traditions were more grassroots than elite. Syncretictraditions represent cultural fusions within the matrix of Hellenism, not the ivory tower speculation ofone city’s intellectual elite. Secondly, in the fusions of this period Jewish influence was frequentlyaccompanied by Chaldean and Persian thought. Alexandria had a large Jewish population, but was byno means alone in this respect. The city of Antioch in Syria was large and cosmopolitan; there a largeJewish population lived alongside a native astrological cultus rooted in Babylonian antiquity. TheRoman Province of Asia Minor – where Persian rule preceded Greek – possessed notablecosmopolitan cities. Major centres of early Christianity may be numbered among them. These includethe cities named in Revelation as the Seven Churches which were in Asia. To name but a few,Ephesus, the capital of the Roman province; Pergamon, whose library was the closest rival to that ofAlexandria; and Thyatira with its prophetess likened to Jezebel. These too had large Jewishpopulations, and another important group, the so-called god-fearing; essentially pagans sympatheticto Jewish tradition. Such coexistence has obvious implications for the fusion of occult traditions inantiquity upon which Western magic is built. One important implication among many is thatSolomonic magic was originally more of a folk tradition than a literary one.Other cities require our attention besides, for while Hermeticism is naturally associated withAlexandria, there is no special reason to identify this Greco-Egyptian city with the origins of eitherTheurgy or the Chaldean Oracles. Certainly both are Hellenised: Hermeticism with its Egyptianconnections, and Theurgy and the Oracles their Chaldean. Certainly too, Alexandria was the premierintellectual capital of the Hellenic world; including of course the Roman period. This status shouldnot be exaggerated to the point of imagining Alexandria to be the only seat of learning in antiquity.More to the point, both Chaldea and Egypt had been influencing Greeks long before Alexandria wasbuilt. The Syrian influence was rather more consistent and prolonged, with major significance to ourtheme; involving as it did both astrological learning and such a central deity as Apollo.Alexandria was a Hellenized Egyptian city; this means that in the cosmopolitan synthesis underlyingthe Western tradition, its innovative and progressive role is distinct from such older seats of Egyptianwisdom as Memphis, Abydos and Thebes. These represent older traditions and contemporaryindigenous conservatism (TEH). In like manner Babylon represents more ancient strains of Chaldeanwisdom, just as other Middle Eastern cities represent truly ancient strands of indigenous traditionrather than centres of cosmopolitan fusion and new syncretic forms. In late antiquity however,Alexandria competed with great cosmopolitan cities in Syria under the Seleucids and Romans. Ofparticular importance to this study are the cities of Antioch and neighbouring Apamea.In Roman times the city of Antioch in Syria, founded 300 BCE by Seleucus I and with a largeMesopotamian population, rivalled Alexandria as the chief city of the East. It is thus equally likelythat the Chaldean Oracles originated in Antioch or its environs; certainly Iamblichus hadconsiderable interest in them. Antioch’s neighbour, Apamea, was home to his school, and toIamblichus himself. He as a great reformer of the movement, initiated the development of theurgicNeoplatonism.Iamblichus and Theurgy"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SUCH REFORMERS, as remarked in Geosophia (11.7, 197), frequently look to older roots. ForIamblichus this meant Pythagoras as well as Plato and Aristotle, but Chaldean sources mustalso be included. The Chaldean links of Pherecydes, Pythagoras and Numenius, not to mentionIamblichus himself, make this a natural assumption. In any case, Iamblichus’ teaching became soinfluential that both Athenian and Alexandrian Neoplatonist schools followed his lead. MeanwhileApamea was also home to the oracular temple of Baal and his influential priesthood. For suchreasons, while until recently I believed the Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy to originate in Alexandria,as do many, I am no longer convinced this is necessarily the case.The mentor of Iamblichus, before he founded his own school, was Porphyry, who in turn had beenthe pupil of the founder of Neo-platonism, Plotinus. This places him in direct line of descent, andunderlines his importance in the movement as a whole. At the same time it as well to emphasise that acommon criticism of Neoplatonism, that it regards the world in a negative light – which it has beenalleged makes ‘pure’ Christian eschatology superior – is not strictly true of his school. As the mostinfluential Neoplatonist leader of late antiquity, this is a crucial point in establishing the credentialsof Neoplatonism and its continuing relevance.Porphyry it seems was not initially enamoured of Theurgy, and one of the surviving worksattributed to Iamblichus is a response to his former mentor’s criticisms. This discussion wasnevertheless friendly, and reflects the intellectual honesty of Porphyry, who throughout his life soughtto gain knowledge of such things as were obscure to him.Whether this work was written by Iamblichus or one of his school is largely unimportant; it reflectsthe ideas of his school and is an authentic and important document. It is however known by varioustitles, including Theurgy. The title On the Egyptian Mysteries is an abbreviation of a fuller titlebestowed upon it in the Renaissance by Ficino. This is On the Mysteries of the Egyptians,Chaldeans and Assyrians. This is important, since while the reputation of Egypt in modern magic iswell established, that of Chaldea has been largely overshadowed and reduced to a cliché. Chaldeancontributions are frequently mentioned but rarely closely examined; it is not uncommon for them to beovershadowed by Kabbalah or considered a mere variant thereof. In terms of the Mysteries or magicAssyria is virtually forgotten; perceptions are perhaps confused by the militaristic image Assyriaobtains from the Old Testament.However, to the Greeks the terms Syria and Assyria were largely interchangeable regardless ofperiod or the nationality of the ruling dynasty. As such it embraced not only Babylon – the seat of theChaldean priestly astrologers – but also the great city of Antioch. While overshadowed nowadays bythe prestige attached to ancient Alexandria this was easily one of the greatest cities of the Romanworld. Indeed at times it was the greatest of all, being known of as far afield as China (97 CE). Thiscity of course was the namesake of the residence of Saint Cyprian in Asia Minor and it is uncertainwhich Antioch he really represents.Also part of Syria or Assyria in the same sense was the city of Babylon, renowned in esoteric lorethroughout the ages. Thus the term simultaneously embraces the Chaldeans, as synonymous with theastrologer priests and magicians that originally lent this term its prestige.In or around 304 CE, Iamblichus returned to Syria and founded his own Neoplatonist school based atApamea in Syria. There are several cities of this name; the one in question is the one near Antioch.Antioch was later visited by the Emperor Julian, who bears the title Apostate given him by laterChristian commentators, due to his eschewing Christianity and seeking to restore Paganism on theframework supplied by the theurgic Neoplatonism of Iamblichus. Julian was a Neoplatonist andTheurgist who venerated Iamblichus intensely. Antagonistic commentators are fond of depicting"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Antioch as irreligious and the Emperor as unpopular there and there is certainly some truth in thestory. However, the proximity of Apamea and its association with Iamblichus and his priestlyancestry is usually forgotten when reviewing such accounts. Antioch was certainly the logical andtraditional base for Julian’s ill-fated military ambitions, but his disappointment with the place mayconnect with more personal expectations.Iamblichus devised a curriculum for studying both Plato and Aristotle. His commentaries on themhowever are largely lost, bar some fragments in other works. It is important to note however that, forIamblichus, Pythagoras was the ultimate authority. That is to say, while no Neoplatonist consideredthemselves anything other than successors of Plato, some – by no means all – modern scholarsconsider Iamblichus and his two immediate predecessors as the founders of Neoplatonism. Hehowever considered Platonism itself a direct descendant of Pythagorean philosophy. In this he echoesNumenius, a kind of proto-Neoplatonist, often described as a Neo-Pythagorean. Significantly,Numenius is the first Hellenistic writer to mention the Chaldean Oracles and his original home wasalso Apamea. There are indeed excellent grounds for considering Pythagoras and the later Platonistsand Neoplatonists as a continuum.We may question the virtues or otherwise of subdividing Classical thought, and contrast it withtendencies to view Christian theology as a continuous historical process. Theologians and academics,despite their different motivations, rarely escape a sense of an impermeable Christianity. That is, abelief system with its own unique character, strangely immune to influence from its pagan environsand neighbours. So distinct that comparison is unnecessary, trivial or downright plain heretical.All this aside, it is worth repeating the point made in Geosophia, that both Pythagoras and hismentor Pherecydes were – like Iamblichus – of Syrian descent. It cannot but be assumed also, on thebasis of available evidence and tradition, that all were well versed in Chaldean sidereal theology.This permissible assumption covers its technical and practical as well as symbolic and religiousforms.For such a major philosopher as Iamblichus it is remarkable that so little of his works havesurvived. The likelihood is indeed that some destruction by the early Church is responsible for this,given the capacity of his thought as a regenerative force in western paganism. Were it not forfragments preserved by Stobæus and others we would be even less informed than we are. Fortunatelyhis successors, notably Proclus, recorded a good deal of his system. These fragments anddescriptions, together with five works still extant and the surviving parts of his work on Pythagoreanphilosophy grant us many insights into his system. While contested by some commentators, Proclusgrants the authorship of Theurgy, or The Mysteries, to him. While much may be made of differencesboth in style and from aspects of his teachings elsewhere, the treatise undoubtedly originated with hisschool.The work represents, as acknowledged and outlined in Geosophia, a comprehensive philosophicalsystem embracing the cult practices of his times. There are selective emphases involved, emphasesthat deserve examination. He underplays the importance of sites, such as famous oracles and temples,and stresses the importance of persons (diviners, philosophers, and – the term is not inappropriate –magicians). This I would justify in terms of his wish to keep abreast of social changes, and indeed ithas more universal relevance today because of this editorial decision, if we may term it as such. Weshould remember that philosophers – Plato included, perhaps particularly – had social agendas, theywere not historians, or scientists. While we have mentioned the intellectual honesty of Porphyry,emphases of this kind were entirely permissible in their approach, and involved no deliberatesubterfuge. Indeed the dialectical method of the Neoplatonists is considerably more honourable and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"open minded than much that followed. Theurgy reveals a good deal of the importance of thisphilosopher. It clarifies his position and importance for the history of thought generally. It also marksa pivotal moment in the development of Neoplatonism as the superstructure of Western magic; andthus his often unacknowledged importance for magicians in particular.Plotinus was the founder of Neoplatonism, (if we have to distinguish it from Platonism, or evenNeo-Pythagoreanism). His theoretical system embraced the divine, the cosmos and the mind;effectively a philosophical Unified Field Theory. It was however essentially theoretical, aside fromthe contemplative applications, a way of understanding things. Iamblichus took this a step further, andas intimated earlier, it is appropriate to see his work as a development on rather than a departurefrom that which went before. Iamblichus produced a more detailed analysis of the formal divisions ofthe emanation scheme and its subdivisions. This built on the work of Plotinus, introducing andelaborating where necessary. All was closely dovetailed throughout with number symbolism on thePythagorean model. Again, this approach is implicit in what had gone before, and at least some ofIamblichus’ additions served the practical applications he was to underline as essential. Of particularimportance was the explicit personification of all the various elements of the scheme: be it the Logosor a decan or a degree of the zodiacal circle. In other words, these were not treated as abstract ideas,but divinities and daimons.Two points require underlining concerning this supposed change.Firstly, it is unlikely he considered this a radical idea, as it was entirely consistent with his Syrio-Chaldean heritage. The word heritage is both more correct and more informative than ‘influences’,which misleadingly implies they come from outside. They were not external to his background, Syriaand Greece had been in fruitful contact for millennia; with some important and formative results forthe magical tradition as covered briefly in Geosophia. These results concern the role of a solar deityin Orphic tradition, among other things.Secondly, it was not without Platonic precedent either. A valuable example of such precedent is theapocalyptic world schema of ‘The Vision of Er.’ Here we encounter an astro-eschatologicaluniverse; its principles are persons, rather than nominal abstractions, whether they are rulers ofplanetary spheres, or fiery men dragging off impure souls for punishment. While writers likeNumenius enhanced the astrological nature of this vision of the cosmos, Plato himself was certainlyimpressed by the astrological cultus of the Chaldeans. As seen in the previous volume, this sameschema was a potent influence on the magicians who wrote and employed the magical papyri. Itschief figures were often invoked, the goddess Necessity being a special deity of the magicians of thetime. While the characters in the ‘Vision’ are a smaller, simpler group than the model delineated byIamblichus, they are so by nature of its narrative purpose. A far greater array of astrological andearthly deities and entourages are nevertheless implicit within it.In practice greater detail – gods or lesser divinities of astrological degrees, elements and so on – isplainly required, or implicit. Since it is largely these that the magician usually deals with, an outlineof the higher principles, reminiscent of later kabbalistic considerations of the Supernal Triad (Monad,Dyad, Triad) need not detain us too long. This is, after all, not a philosophical treatise; as Geosophiastipulated, Classical philosophy and religion in general are explanations. They follow after thatwhich is explained: magical and eschatological thought and action, into which they introduce ethicaland other considerations. It is to this basal level I wish to go, while nevertheless opposing thetendency to disregard Classical philosophy in modern occultism.In the system of Iamblichus the higher worlds are themselves deities, with the Nous identified,critically, with the Demiurge who creates the known universe. A very similar doctrine – where this"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"principle is the Son, one of the Holy Trinity – was developed within the Platonising thought of earlyChristian theology, which of course owes a tremendous debt to Hellenistic thought. Although underkabbalistic influence we are used to thinking of Four Worlds, more common in magical tradition is athreefold schema. This is certainly true of the Neoplatonist universe, so that so far the cosmos ofIamblichus involves two classes of deities.More fundamental to magical thought and action is the third class; personifications of astrologicaland natural forces. It is interaction with these that constitutes a major portion of magical practice, asalso religious practice within certain parameters. While those above are reasonably numerous, whenhis schema reaches the third ‘Mundane’ class they become – not surprisingly – absolutely prolific. Tobegin with, as outlined in Geosophia, for each major division of the cosmos there is the basictheurgic subdivision of gods, angels, demons and heroes.Thus, to take the Zodiac, it is firstly presided over by twelve celestial or Olympian gods. It is thensub-divided first into thirty-six decans and then 360 degrees. Each is personified, or more correctly,populated, for the god of each subdivision has an entourage at various levels of evolution. From thethirty-six decan gods seventy-two other gods are emanated. Examples of these may be found in thesystem of Ostanes and elsewhere. (So too the influence of Iamblichus is writ large in Agrippa’sOccult Philosophy. See his sections dealing with the classes of spirits, to which I frequently havecause to refer, in particular TBOP III.XVI).As well as astrological deities such as these, there are the nature deities. Here too subdivision andincrementally expansive emanation plays a role. Twenty-one chiefs produce forty-two further deitieson this level. As we might legitimately expect, whether in polytheistic terms or one of the morepantheistic forms of Christianity, a great many more follow. There is a host of guardian divinities, ofindividuals and also of nations. While operative upon earth these dovetail with astrological thought.We encounter the genius of the nativity first in Hellenistic thought, almost certainly from Syriansources earlier than Iamblichus. So too in Ptolemaic astrology we encounter attribution of nations toastrological rulers; this of course means gods and angels, not some nebulous abstract principle. Theprocess extends to specific localised places, such as streams, towns and even particular crossroadsand boundaries, down to single residences of town or country.Thus a host of spiritual beings extended through the Three Worlds from the One down to themanifest Universe in all its diversity. The complex mathematical structures he employed, and theattendant extension of the cast, may make this look like multiplication. In fact Iamblichus is fittingNeoplatonist theory to essentially encompass the existing world of gods and nature spirits etc. alreadyimplicit in regional beliefs of the entire Hellenistic world and beyond. As said above regarding the‘Vision of Er,’ this increase was not essentially a departure from Platonism, whose usage servedspecialised illustrative purposes only, and should not be understood as one. The distinction betweenIamblichus and earlier forms involves his reasons for the apparent extension of the dramatis personaein adapting the existing theory. He took a model hitherto serving a contemplative purpose, andadapted it to the more practical requirements of Theurgy.In doing so he provided the perfect template for the grimoires. As Richard Kieckhefer remarks inForbidden Rites (155):The notion [in the grimoires] of a demonic hierarchy, with a multiplicity of named and rankedspirits, stems chiefly from the Neoplatonists, and above all Iamblichus. Proclus, drawing onIamblichus’s elaborate categorization, spoke of daimones as ruling the fire, the air, the water, theearth and the underground region; to this Psellus added lucifugues (or light fleeing) demons, and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Johannes Trithemius lent the weight of his authority to this system.This is a Pagan categorisation, adapted to Christian uses, but in which initially the majority of specieswere not considered demonic. Indeed Theurgic daimons are intermediaries of the gods to whoseentourages they belong. While these gods certainly exercise authority over them, the relationship ismore complex than the thwarting angels of recent scholarship. The stressing of this latter idea, while Ifeel overemphasising Doctor Rudd, has a legitimate point as regards the influence of such an angel VS.demon theme in the Testament of Solomon. Nevertheless Agrippa, and between him and Iamblichusstands Pseudo-Dionysus in the same vein, prefer the Hellenistic tradition; his hierarchy is plainlyderived from Iamblichus in every detail (TBOP III.XVI).More importantly for the present, Iamblichus is thus revealed as the primary ancestor of grimoiredemonology, so too he represents the source of the accompanying theurgic theory and practice. It isfrom this crucial role – among other affinities – that there emerges a fitting comparison: of Iamblichusas a pivotal historical founder figure with his mythical near contemporary; Saint Cyprian, patron saintof magicians."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ATHE CONFESSION OF SAINT CYPRIANCCORDING TO THE APOCRYPHAL Confession of Saint Cyprian (written 350 to 379 CE) he was initiatedinto numerous Mystery cults and rites. Aside from the anti-pagan cast, much of the material isquite representative of a magician of the fourth century of the Christian era; his bookshelfbearing the Chaldean Oracles and the Testament of Solomon besides magical papyri (technicalhermetica) and philosophical works. Thus the Confession contains a virtual hit list of subjects toarise later. This is not surprising, since the Confession dates from approximately the period of theEmperor Julian; a fervent supporter of the Theurgic tradition, and a real threat to Christianity’s socio-political ambitions. From these facts arise my comparison of Cyprian with Iamblichus, the leader ofthe Theurgic movement within Neoplatonism.The text here, while abbreviated and imperfect, has the distinction of being the translation ofMadame Blavatsky. In recompense for this esoteric source, I acknowledge a partial and posteriordebt to Lynn Thorndike’s work in confirming my own impression of the themes arising herein. Otheracademic studies support this interpretation, while also helping overcome some of Blavatsky’somissions; bracketed sections supplement Blavatsky. The numbering of the passages is my own, tofacilitate reference within my remarks.After an introduction where he renounces his pagan past – and the gods as demons – the Confessionspeaks as follows:1 ... I am that Cyprianus, who, vowed to Apollo [Mēn] from his infancy, was early initiated intoall the arts of the dragon.According to the main tradition, Cyprian was a native of Antioch of Pisidia; famous for the religioussite known as the precinct of Mēn Askaenos, who was identified with Apollo. There are othertraditions regarding Antioch in Syria, relevant to some considerations, but not here. Following thePisidian reading of our text, he here claims familiarity with the rites and Mysteries of Mēn fromchildhood. The cult flourished there from the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE. Mēn is an interestingand important deity. Iconography surviving from this time, which like Serapis includes Britishexamples, shows Mithraic and Dionysian influence. Important too is the fact that he is oftensyncretised with Apollo, patron deity of the Orphic goetes and of the theurgists alike. He wouldtypically have been associated with a goddess. Although there are archaeological indicators of aCybele cult in the city, these may represent or have been imposed on an earlier Neolithic goddess.Hecate was associated with the god in Mysia and elsewhere, as she is in the Chaldean Oracles. Infact the upshot is not significantly altered either way; pagan Mysteries, and necromantic oracularfunctions, are typically connected with just such a shrine. In this respect it is a natural setting for theformation of the Cyprian legend.A Lydian monument to Mēn of the period 164–65 CE mentions an angel as serving him, an instanceof Mēn as a supreme god (CS 76) in pagan monotheism (or henotheism). Another Lydian inscriptioncalls him god of heaven, great heavenly Mēn, great power and deathless god (my translation). LikeZeus Hypsistos, Mēn could plainly be invoked as supreme deity in Asia Minor at this period. Hisrelations with Hecate or Cybele in such a context require clarification; it is feasible, even likely, thatHecate might be functioning as his angel. Like Ephesus and Thyatira the city had a large population ofGreeks, Jews and Phrygians. Saint Paul travelled through the Roman province of Pisidia, and it musthave witnessed the same three way controversies of Jewish, Christian and Pagan traditions."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The dragon cited in this passage has enduring significance in Christian and necromantic lore. Areference to the rite of Stepterion is likely in the reference to a dragon rite; as academic commentatorshave already surmised. Both Strabo and Plutarch connect this rite with Apollo’s slaying of the dragonPython. The Red Dragon of the grimoires is identical, representing a partial recovery of the symbol.One aspect of its use in Christian polemic is to diabolise Apollo, by placing a hostile interpretationupon his association with Python. As discussed in Geosophia, the Pythoness also had a far worsereputation in Christian lore than the Sibyl, incidental as this may be.2 Even before the age of seven I had already been introduced into the temple of Mithra:The Confession moves from the ‘Phrygian’ prehistory of the Mystery cults, to the cult of Mithrasexisting in Roman times. Mithraism represents the superimposing of the God of Eternal Time onto theolder solar cultus (represented by the Orphic cum Phrygian Apollo). As the Confession proceedsCyprian is initiated into Greco-Egyptian magic, which we can view as representing the magicalpapyri and the older reputation of their homeland. Finally he is initiated into Chaldean magic,representing the Oracles and Theurgy. In the course of this chronological journey Cyprian reachespinnacles of initiation, but the Sun has descended from first to second and finally third ranking god.This descent might be measured on a scale where first is most divine, and last is diabolical. In thishistorical process – here symbolised as a sliding scale – entities lower in rank than the Sun sufferstill greater loss of status. Hecate descends from Great Goddess to lady of witches, ghosts anddemons, and much of the pagan spirit world becomes diabolised.The connection of – so to speak – the Roman Mithras with Asia Minor has been the subject ofcontroversy. Strong tradition links the arrival of the cult in Rome with Pompey’s expeditions againstthe pirates of Cilicia, but his land campaigns also involved Pamphylia and Pisidia, and the wholeregion saw extensive contact and colonisation. Nevertheless, other than aristocratic names, theevidence for a widespread Mithras cult in the region is apparently slender. One possibility is that heoriginates partly in an aristocratic cult, with inevitable military and political connections. Romanadoption would then be partly comparable to the role of Serapis in social and political union ofGreeks and Egyptians. A supposedly sacrilegious rite performed by the pirates at a mountain shrine ofHephæstus implies earlier local traditions prior to Roman Mithraism; involving a deity other thanMithras, such as Hephæstus or Æshma.There are various possibilities and aspects to the question. For our purposes however the mythicand iconographic connections make a good deal of sense. Mithras wears a Phrygian cap and hismysteries are in some way linked to the Mysteries of Cybele. So too he synchs in with the prevailingtendency towards a solar pantheistic deity, involving strong Syrian and Neoplatonist influences. Hisrelation to a level of development of religious ideas in which Zervan or Aion is the highestconception of deity is noted herein at various points.3 Three years later, my parents taking me to Athens to be received as a citizen, I was permittedlikewise to penetrate the mysteries of Ceres lamenting her daughter [Demeter & Persephone], andI also became the guardian of the Dragon [strictly Erechtheus, but is Medusa implied?] in theTemple of Pallas [Athena].4 Ascending after that to the summit of Mount Olympus, the Seat of the Gods, as it is called; theretoo I was initiated into the real meaning of their [the gods’] speeches and their clamorous"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"manifestations. It is there that I was made to see in imagination those trees and all those herbs thatoperate such prodigies with the help of demons; ...The speeches likely refer to oracles. The clamorous manifestations indicate apparitions duringMystery initiations and by extension theurgic rites. While Eastern interpretations and elements hadentered these rites many features nevertheless reflect the practices of much earlier Thracian traditionsand those of Greek root-cutters. As will be seen, the depiction of tree and herbal lore as demonic isreflected in the practical differences between decan lore in the Jewish ToS and the ‘pagan’ SacredBook. There is a subtext referring to medical magic, which makes sense in the context of magic of theperiod.5 ... and I saw their dances, their combats, their snares, illusions and promiscuities. I heard theirsinging. I saw finally, for forty consecutive days, the phalanx of the gods and goddesses, sendingfrom Olympus, as though they were kings, spirits to represent them on earth and act in their nameamong all the nations. [Here is the palace, as it were, from which they send forth the winds, foreach to do its work on earth and among all nations.]Regarding the first part of the passage Nilsson points to Asia Minor and pageants representing paganmyth. With the sending from Olympus decan lore is probably implied, the twelve Olympians rulingthe signs, sub-divided into decans ruled by their subordinates. This matches the hierarchical patternsof Iamblichus. The reference to nations (ruled by different decan gods) and to winds (representing theFour Kings among the spirits), lend credence to this. References to the winds in the PGM are notinfrequent, and they will be encountered periodically herein.6 At that time I lived entirely on fruit, eaten only after sunset, the virtues of which were explainedto me by the seven priests of the sacrifices. [Alt: my only meal was one of nuts after sunset. Being15 years of age I was there initiated by the seven hierophants in the energies of each of them.]Thorndike appears to accept the Confession as written by the Bishop of Antioch. This assumptionaside his interpretation of passages 4 to 6 is worth quoting:More stress is laid upon the power of demons and herbs in a description which has been left usby Saint Cyprian, bishop of Antioch in the third century, of some pagan mysteries upon MountOlympus into which he was initiated when a boy of fifteen and which have been explained asOrphic rites. His initiation was under the charge of seven hierophants, lasted for forty days, andincluded instruction in the virtues of magic herbs and visions of the operations of demons. Hewas also taught the meaning of musical notes and harmonies, and saw how times and seasonswere governed by good and evil spirits. In short, magic, pseudo-science, occult virtue, andperhaps astrology formed an important part of Orphic lore.Given the polemical agenda, the account of ascetic practices (6) is – not surprisingly – kept to aminimum. Such practices were a major feature of theurgic practice, and contemporary Mystery cultsalso. The Theurgists were preceded in this by Cretan and Thracian ‘shamans,’ and subsequently inOrphism. So too the herbs, stones and water that featured in theurgic rites of purification depend onearlier tradition. As we learn from the biography by Marinus, the great Neoplatonist teacher, Proclusemployed both Orphic and Chaldean rites of purification. These included bathing in the sea, ritual"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"baths and lustrations. Proclus himself refers directly to similar rites of the Mystery cults. In Theurgysuch preparations were essential for the critical rite of ascension, as well as in other ritualsundertaken by theurgists. Psellus, whose works refer to those of Proclus, confirms that suchpurifications were part of the Theurgic cult as revealed in the Oracles:The Chaldean says that we cannot be borne upwards towards god, unless we strengthen thevehicle of the soul by material sacraments. For he believes that the soul is purified by stones,herbs and conjurations and consequently becomes more agile regarding the ascension.Such purifications formed part of the preparation for their main ritual. Also to theurgic rites in generaland to the ascetic life overall; we may be sure the same was true of the magicians. Lewy elucidatesthe influence of Syrian demonology on Mystery rites in the late period. Purifications were latterlybelieved essential to the performance of initiations; preventing the opposition of demons. It canhardly be doubted that this supplied the opposing polemicists with a valuable weapon.The seven hierophants likely represent the seven planets, and their associated correspondences inplants, stones, animals and perfumes.7 When I was fifteen, my parents desired that I should be made acquainted, not only with all thenatural laws in connection with the generation and corruption of bodies on earth, in the air and inthe seas, but also with all the other forces grafted on these by the Prince of the World, in order tocounteract their primal and divine constitution.[I came also to Argos at the time of the mysteries of Hera, and was there initiated in thecounsels of the unity of air with æther, and of æther with air, and likewise of earth with water,and water with air. I came also to Elis and came to know Artemis Tauropolos in Lacedæmon inorder to learn the blending and dividing of matter and the raising of oblique and savagenarratives.]Nilsson points out that Argos was a province as well as a city. There appear to have been moremysteries celebrated there than in any other Roman province: Lerna was the location of mysteries ofDemeter, Epidauros of Asclepius, Hecate at Aegina and Poseidon on the Isthmus. He traces theassociation of Hera with Air to Plato and the Stoics, but the equation is at least as old as Empedocles.This astrological and elemental view of the gods was certainly part of the thought of the age.[And what belongs to manlike divination I apprehended from the Phrygians and I learned how toinspect the liver; among barbarians I learned divination from birds and the contortions of beasts,and the observing of sounds of those good at knowing, and the shrill cries of each wood and stoneand the sounds of the dead in their graves, and the noise of doors and the palpitation of limbs. Ilearned also to know the motion of blood in bodies according to its energy, and the compositionsand extension of warts, and the throwing of words and numbers into words, and of words intonumbers, and the superficial effects of disease on the bodies as though natural, and the natural asthough feigned, and oaths which are heard and not heard, and agreements in hostility. Nothing onthe earth nor in the sea nor in the air was hidden from me, neither in the way of apparitions, nor inthe way of knowledge; no changeful things, no mechanical, no artificial things, not evenlegerdemain with the text of Scripture, and all such things.]8 At twenty, I went to Memphis, where, penetrating into the Sanctuaries, I was taught to discern"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"all that pertains to the communications of demons [that is, spirits, or daimones] with terrestrialmatters, their aversion for certain places, their sympathy and attraction for others, their expulsionfrom certain planets, certain objects and laws, their persistence in preferring darkness and theirresistance to light. There I learned the number of the fallen Princes, and that which takes place inhuman souls and bodies they enter into communication with ...The description of leaders of spirits as Princes in a 4th century text is reminiscent of later grimoirehierarchies, one of many signs of continuity. This continuity indicates long term dependence on earlysources including Hermeticism and Iamblichus.9 I learnt the analogy that exists between earthquakes and rains, between the motion of the earthand the motion of the seas; I saw the spirits of the Giants plunged in subterranean darkness andseemingly supporting the earth like a man carrying a burden on his shoulders.10 When thirty, I travelled to Chaldea to study there the true power of the air, placed by somein the fire and by the more learned in light. I was taught to see that the planets were in theirvariety as dissimilar as the plants on earth, and the stars were like armies ranged in battleorder. I knew the Chaldean division of Ether into 365 parts, and I perceived that every one ofthe demons who divide it among themselves was endowed with that material force thatpermitted him to execute the orders of the Prince and guide all the movements therein. They[the Chaldeans] explained to me how those Princes had become participants in the Council ofDarkness, ever in opposition to the Council of Light.Fittingly, for a magician of the Greco-Roman period where magic was defined by the themes of themagical papyri, his career is said to have begun among the Memphite priesthood. Resemblances inthe doctrines learned here and in Chaldea (the 365 parts of the spirits’ rule) indicate more than ashortage of ideas. The Chaldean contribution to the Greco-Egyptian magic was substantial. True,Greek and Egyptian names and forms were frequent in the dramatis personæ of magic, but thecosmology was dominated by Chaldean ideas. Indeed all religions in the region were stronglyinfluenced by ‘astrological’ ideas conceived in terms of a pantheon of gods and spirits. That theentities here personified as evil are celestial (as indicated by stars & Ether) rather than infernal isextremely significant.Much of the generally negative perception of ‘Pagan’ spirits in the Confession is, naturally,polemical rather than actual. In (9) Blavatsky omitted a passage concerning among other things theforms of demons. Part of its importance is in affirming the relationship of the Testament of Solomonand the Confession. It naturally involves no formulæ and is essentially moralistic and also ratherincoherent in places. A few of the demons’ appearances are described, typifying the vices theypersonify. It is far from a complete list and their astrological attributions and any remedy for them asin the Testament are never apparent. More important is that Cyprian enumerates them as 365 innumber, plainly associated with contemporary magical ideas. As the number of days of a solar yearthis number was sacred to important solar pantheistic deities; Abraxas and Meithras (the earlierspelling of the latter had the value of 360).The 365 spirits (of the solar circuit) are – the text claims – vain and empty, full of pretence ofwisdom, virtue and justice with which they mislead the philosophers of Greece. The polemicaldistortion of rival teachings – at the very root of early Christian demonology – could hardly be"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"clearer.In this passage Cyprian’s sojourn in Chaldea contains many interesting features. A negativeportrayal of theurgic ideas – associated with the Chaldean Oracles – is undoubtedly part of thesubtext. By the air is meant the luminous sky and its metaphysical associations. The Pistis Sophiaamong other sources illustrates the contemporary belief that this was the realm of the decans.Chapter 39 vs. 7: And I am become as a decan who is [i.e. dwells] in the air alone.That air’s nature can be interpreted as either fire or light (by the more learned, that is thephilosophers) is deeply significant. The older more ‘primitive’ ideas, no longer philosophicallyfashionable, involve fire; this element is strongly associated with the Goetic strata, which whiledevalued is nonetheless where the magical elements of Theurgy originate.Naturally the Chaldean lore Cyprian is taught concerns astrology, in contemporary magical form.The division of time into 365 parts, each ruled by spirits ranged under chiefs is familiar, associatedas they are with what to later magicians were Solomonic or even kabbalistic ideas. This passage toohas connections with the lore embodied in the Testament. Nevertheless the Confession wasaddressed to a pagan audience and the ideas concerned are embodied in so-called Gnostic gems andother Pagan magic. This Pagan identity and origin is long prior to the efforts of theological spin-doctors and the neglect of history by later occultists.11 I became acquainted with the Mediatores and upon seeing the covenants they were mutuallybound by, I was struck with wonder upon learning the nature of their oaths to observe them.Note well that despite the distance theurgists tried to establish between themselves and the Goetes,Theurgy emphasised both a pact and a ‘necromantic’ initiation. The Mediatores and the covenantsformed with them reflect theurgic cosmogony and practice, and contemporary magical approachesfrom which they derive. The diabolical pact is an artefact of 4th century Christian polemic andrepresents an inversion of the theurgic compact. As understood by their opponents the nature of thespirit and the post-mortem consequences of the compact are entirely reversed."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ACONJUNCTIONPARTICULAR FORM of ritual practiced by the Chaldean Theurgists and their Neoplatonist heirs wasthe conjunction. Similar ritual procedures, as with all theurgic practice, can be found incontemporary magic of the goetes. It is known that Proclus made use of such rites. The termused was sysiasa, and is known from magical texts as well as from the philosophers. It translates asconjunction, namely of the operator with a spirit or god.Such a spirit or god was known as the assistant daimon, or daimon paredros. This was a generalpurpose arrangement in magical practice; through incantations and other procedures the magicianconjoined themselves with such a spirit for their magical purposes. Many examples are to be found inthe papyri. In essence the conjunction is a form of pact underlying Western magical practice.Needless to say, this far predates what has been alleged to be the late appearance of the pact. Thisdisposes of the idea of the pact as a supposed romantic distortion of Solomonic magic in the bluegrimoires.Through Psellus (11th century Byzantine) we know that the founder of Theurgy, the first Julian,performed such a conjunction on behalf of his son, the second Julian. Through this ritual Julian theTheurgist was conjoined from infancy with all the gods and the soul of Plato. This is important fortheurgy, since it rendered them magically capable of aligning their magico-religious principles withPlatonic philosophy. For us it has additional significance: the conjunction’s effects are not limited togods and spirits, it also concerns souls. The underlying conception is one of practical eschatology ornecromancy.Analogies with Hermetic practice will follow in due place, it is sufficient for now to note thepractice of the conjunction as central to theurgic praxis from its beginning.From Proclus it is known that the practice of conjunction among the theurgists involved particularelements: divine names proper to the day and night, to the particular month and the year appropriate tothe specific ritual. In this Theurgy bears a striking resemblance to Abano’s Heptameron, and theresemblance need not surprise us. It defines an approach to magic founded first and foremost uponastrological principles. This cannot be underlined too strongly, since cabala is so often credited withthis role.This chronological structure speaks of a time-god whose presence in grimoire practice is far fromresidual. Appropriately enough Proclus also mentions invocations of the Lord of Time by thetheurgists. In the Oracles this god is Aion, identical with Zervan in the traditions of the Babylonians,Sabaoth is a frequent synonym in related traditions. In the papyri very similar procedures are found,these syncretic rites are recognisably the direct precursors of the Christian grimoires. So too theidentity of the Supreme God in the grimoire tradition and its immediate precursors is not as clear asmay be imagined.For example, only one name of God is invoked throughout the Testament of Solomon, three timesby Solomon and once by Michael the archangel, as follows:Vs. 5 [Solomon]: And it came about through my prayer that grace was given to me from the LordSabaoth by Michael his archangel. [He brought me] a little ring, having a seal consisting of anengraved stone... [Michael] ‘Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord Godhas sent thee, the highest Sabaoth.’Vs. 52 [Solomon]: I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell me by what name thou"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"art frustrated along with thy host.Vs. 73 [Solomon]: Then I Solomon invoked the name of the Lord Sabaoth, and questioned each[of the decans] in turn as to what was its character.The Tetragrammaton is conspicuous by its absence even from the ring of Solomon. So too nowhere inthe text do we find strings of divine names as in the later grimoires. Even the formulæ that commandthe demons – varied as they are – do not contain them. It is no accident that the name which doesappear is Sabaoth; which also appears frequently on magical engraved gems of the period. Theconception of God embodied by Sabaoth in this context involves Chaldean influence, as indeed doesthe Solomonic medical magic of which the Testament is the monument. In other words, just asSolomonic magical medicine is partly rooted in Babylonian ideas (see Lenormant’s ChaldeanMagic), so too Sabaoth represents a Jewish conception parallel to Zervan and Aion; he embodieseternal time, while subordinate gods and spirits represent its parts.In the papyri occur several variant compilations with the name of The Eighth Book of Moses (seePGM XIII.1–343, 343–646 &c.). Various statements regarding time gods occur, which Lewy compareswith Proclus’ statements quoted earlier. The context is appropriate, for the god Aion is invoked inthis text. So too the role of time gods is strongly underlined:53–59: before which you say the gods of the hours ... and the gods of the days and those of theweeks, and their compulsive formula; for the god will not listen but refuse you as uninitiatedunless you declare the lord of the day and the hour ...Take note that where Egyptian influence is uppermost in the papyri, the god of the hour is likely torule a decan rather than a planet. Very similar material appears in the next variant text:379–381: call on the god of the hour and him of the day, so that you may have sponsorship fromthem. If you do not [first] invoke them the god will not hear you, as being uninitiated. Now youwill find the gods of the hours and those of the days, and the compulsive formula for each in theKey of Moses ...In this way the magician preceded invocations or other operations by an act of conjunction.Particularly conjoining themselves with specific spirits connected with the time of working. Thus theinvocation of Aion as Lord of Time is the paradigm of this process, even when employed for lesserresults. Indeed, it remains the paradigm of such processes; even when the role of the Lord of Time isunsuspected in a later magical system.A Chaldean conjunction is delineated by Psellus, drawing in turn upon Proclus. The operationdescribed is known as a raising up of plants. To prepare this the magician enlists the assistance ofthe daimon of the plants, a similar procedure applying to stones. Such spirits govern natural materialsof the required nature, as the deputies of the god; of which more shortly. This is accomplished byconsecrating the plants where they grow. In the papyri this is achieved by sprinklings of natron,perfuming with incense and by circumambulation. After this the plants are plucked from the ground,lifted up and their spirit invoked.That this and the conjunction which follows are forms of pact is plain from the context. Pselluscalls the following ritual a hidden covenant, affected by an offering of spices, plants and stones;crocus, myrrh and Apollo’s laurel. These were buried in a circle marked out on the ground. The"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"intention of the ritual to come was then spoken aloud by the ritualist. On the next day he returned tothe place, and disinterred the hylic substances; they were then swiftly held aloft with the left hand.Along with this gesture a group of four distinct powers were invoked in order. Our source does notname, but rather describes, these. The first is the teacher of the ritual performed. This teacher orpatron Lewy interprets as Apollo; this is consistent with Lewy’s understanding of the Oracles, andalso conforms to the Orphic tradition of goetia outlined in Geosophia. Apollo in the Chaldean contextis likely a cover name for a sun god of Syria or Asia Minor. In equivalent Solomonic contexts thispatron is Michael. Nor should we forget the widespread identification of Apollo and Horus, whoappears to be mentioned in the Oracles.1 But God is He having the head of the Hawk. The same is the first, incorruptible, eternal,unbegotten, indivisible, dissimilar: the dispenser of all good; indestructible; the best of the good,the Wisest of the wise; He is the Father of Equity and Justice, self-taught, physical, perfect, andwise – He who inspires the Sacred Philosophy.Eusebius, Præparatio evangelica, Liber I:XHowever as noted by Thomas Stanley and others:This Oracle does not appear in either of the ancient collections, nor in the group of oracles givenby any of the medieval occultists. Cory seems to have been the first to discover it in thevoluminous writings of Eusebius, who attributes the authorship to the Persian Zoroaster.But we digress.After Apollo, next are deputies or daimons who rule the hylic substances. Next, in accord with theprinciples outlined above, is the ruler of the day. Again a Solomonic equivalency is readily found. Itis notable, given the instruction in the Eighth Book above, that this precedes the invocation of Aion innext place. Last, but by no means least is the demon lord of the Four. Lewy interprets this last inastrological terms, as the Year. A more immediate Solomonic equivalent to the term cannot fail tosuggest itself. Lewy is right of course to associate the term with the circuit of the Sun, however theFour in Solomonic demonology would be Kings of the four directions; associated with the solarquarters in the year. The chief of these is Oriens, itself a title associated with solar religion of theSyrio-Roman type.Although Psellus uses the term covenant he does not further elaborate on the term. It is plain enoughfrom parallel passages in the papyri, of which the so-called Mithraic liturgy is by no means the onlyexample. The term covenant describes the conjunction with an assistant daimon; the spirit to whomthe ritual is addressed. In terms of a hostile theology, theurgic ritual depended on pacts with devils.12 Believe me, I saw the Devil; believe me I have embraced him and have conversed with him;when I was yet quite young, he saluted me by the title of the new Jambres, declaring me worthy ofmy ministry [initiation] ... He promised me continual help during life and a principality afterdeath. Having become in great honour [an Adept] under his tuition, he placed under my orders aphalanx of demons, and when I bade him good-bye, Courage, good success, excellent Cyprian,he exclaimed, rising up from his seat to see me to the door, plunging thereby those present into aprofound admiration.Jambres (or Iambres) and Iannes were the magicians of Pharoah who opposed Moses; the insinuation"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"regarding Cyprian’s magic is plain. Similarly both magicians are mentioned in verse 125 of the ToS;the demon Abezithibou confesses to having aided them, thus identifying Solomon’s magic asforbidden and ungodly. The appearance of Jambres in the Confession suggests the polemic was aimedat Hellenising Jews as well as Pagans, espousing or sympathetic to solar theology and late paganmonotheism.To summarise, the account of Cyprian’s career in the Confession credits him with initiation into theGreek and Phrygian Mysteries; those of Demeter and Persephone among others. Despite theclumsiness of this purported pedigree, there is nothing intrinsically unlikely about crediting suchinterests and qualifications to a magician of the time. As Fritz Graf points out, the papyri are steepedin the language of the Mysteries, and there is no good reason for assuming these to be borrowedgoods. Rather, as elaborated in my Geosophia, the Mysteries are the authentic backdrop of the goetictradition.A magician such as this would be able to assert with feeling and sincerity such a speech as this fromthe papyri:I have been initiated;I have descended to the Chamber of the Idæan Dactyls;I have seen the Holy Things!I call upon you who have all forms and many names, double-horned goddess, Mēne. Whoseform none knows save IAO alone, Creator of the Universe; Who shaped you into the 28 shapesof the world:This claim has certain riders more implicit than explicit in the Confession. A pagan magician, farfrom worshipping demons disguised as gods, would have concerns not specifically underlined ratherthan countered or parodied in that text. Rather than dryly list and describe these influences, it isinstructive to consider what Cyprian may have had on his bookshelves. Besides philosophical works,extant and influential ‘occult’ texts of the day included: the Greek magical papyri, the ChaldeanOracles and the Testament of Solomon. Cyprian would thus be aware of principles present inTheurgy; this whether via low-Platonism mixed with practical Hermetica, or as a full flownphilosopher magus such as Apollonius of Tyana. He, rather than King Solomon, represents a magiciancontemporary with all these seminal texts and influences, at the juncture of Jewish, Pagan andChristian traditions convergent in the grimoires."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"WImmortalisationHAT IS OMITTED in the hostile account of Theurgy and technical Hermeticism is the salvationistgoal and basis, the practical eschatology. This is perhaps not surprising, as a miracle workerwith an eschatological programme is supposed to be unique to Christianity.It becometh you to hasten unto the Light, and the Rays of the Father; from whom was sent unto youa Soul endued with much Mind.Chaldean Oracles, 160The primary sacramental ritual of the theurgists was the immortalisation of the soul. This goal, withits obvious eschatological context, resembled and drew upon similar sources to general necromanticpractice among the contemporary goetes. The neophyte lay down as if dead, covered by a sheet,which did not extend over the head. Sacrifices for the dead were performed on behalf of the initiate,followed by the separation of the soul from the body by appropriate rites. In first place occurred theconjuration of the soul of the initiate by the theurgist in charge of the rite. Thereafter the candidateinvoked the three rulers in accordance with the Oracles. These rulers of the light can be identifiedas: the Lord of Time, Aion the solar ruler whom the oracles term Apollo the Lord of the Air through whom the solar rays are transmitted (in grimoire terms, the chief ofthe Four Kings, Lucifer-Oriens).This achieved they approached a manifest ray of light and inbreathed its substance. This produced astate of union of the separated soul with the ‘mystic ray,’ thus permitting their spiritual ascent. Thisrite, in common with theurgic action generally, draws on the earlier solar theology and goetic ritual.Many aspects of it have a direct bearing on our next main topic, the Testament of Solomon, as well asthe pagan literature to which it was a partial response."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"TTHEORETICAL IMPLICATIONSA Theurgic InterludeI became acquainted with the Mediatores and upon seeing the covenants they were mutuallybound by, I was struck with wonder upon learning the nature of their oaths to observe them.Confession of Saint CyprianHEURGY, as demonstrated by Lewy, was developed from three sources. Platonic philosophy andoriental religious ideas were so to speak the intellectual background, but what they allegorisedand reinterpreted was the older magic. Indeed in his partial reconstructions of theurgic ritualLewy frequently remarks upon resemblances of theurgic practice to the magical papyri and theactivities of the despised goetes. It is these resemblances, widely recognised by scholars (Dodds,Cumont, Lewy etc), which primarily concern us. Lewy’s study, showing how the interpretative layerswere added to goetia, facilitates also their partial removal.First it is necessary to examine the new layers, not least insofar as they inform the later grimoires,whose grandfather is undoubtedly Iamblichus. Whether Platonic or Oriental these can briefly bedescribed as concerning ‘new’ conceptions of deity. Two in particular inform the superimposedlayers of interpretation. Firstly there is the Supreme Being; whether the One of the Neoplatonists orthe Ormazd of Persian monotheism. This is an entirely transcendental deity, facilitating the adoptionof Neoplatonism by Christians (firstly among the Church Fathers, subsequently by Renaissancemagicians). Secondly there is Aion, a god of Time and Eternity; related to the Persian Zervan, butadapted to Chaldean ideas. Sometimes one of these is present, sometimes both, with accompanyingvariations; throughout the inter-related ritual and textual literary tradition.By contrast the ritual material appropriated by Theurgy as represented by the Chaldean Oracles,which still informs Western magic, did not necessarily concern either of these. It drew primarily uponSyrian and Egyptian solar theology and older chthonic practices, from which level the active dramatispersonæ in theurgic ritual derive. That is to say, in their Greek personæ, Apollo and Hecate still takethe dominant roles; the new ‘greater’ gods are more often implied by a superimposed interpretation.These two active deities are supplemented by the Four Winds and their spirits; of these I will have agood deal more to say as this study proceeds. Iamblichus and the theurgists distinguished themselvesfrom the goetes, whose practices nevertheless closely resembled theirs. It would be unwise to deducefrom this that the goetes contemporary with Theurgy maintained intact the older religious conceptionsthemselves. Aion and other conceptions of a higher deity abound in the papyri, as do elements takendirectly from Plato. There are however strong elements of archaic traditions, for example from thecult of Artemis.Nevertheless Lewy’s stratified analysis of theurgic ritual and its cosmology are important formodern magicians in a variety of ways. The insights involved assist us to understand the reliance ofceremonial magic of later times upon Iamblichus, and by extension the theurgists and ChaldeanOracles. The cosmology of the grimoires differs little from that of the theurgists; so little that it is avery simple matter to map theurgic cosmology upon the Tree of Life beloved of recent revivalistschools. The Supreme God, or that part of him we may apprehend, corresponds to Kether. Thisconception of deity draws upon Zoroastrian and Platonic ideas; these two influences acted upon thetraditions of the region as a mutually reinforcing feedback loop over several centuries. Immediately"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"next in rank, in Chokmah – the sphere of fixed stars – is the time god Aion. It will be necessary tospeak further of him and his relation to Zervanism at various points in our study. Beneath both of thesecome the planetary worlds, at the centre and heart of which is the Sun god, third in rank according tothis conception.Lewy contrasts the above model with that of the Mithraic cult, as envisaged by himself and Cumont;with which interpretation I generally concur. Like the above this model was essentially Syrian withZoroastrian influences. It is dissimilar however in the absence of the Zoroastrian cum Platonic God.In this more ‘primitive’ cosmogony the highest deity is Aion, and next in status is the Sun godpersonified by Mithras.Since Zervan or Aion represents eternal time, and both Sun and Moon are measurers of time, thereis a conceptual link between them. In these symbolic schemas and astrological paganism, this wasrepresented by Saturn – Kronos – as Lord of Time and outermost planet; linking the world sphereswith that of the stars. In this ‘between’ zone are found concepts of a demiurge or logos, frequentlyretaining solar attributes. Saturn nevertheless retains equally strong lunar, nocturnal associations inmagical thinking.This Zervanist model was built upon a still older structure, which Lewy refers to as Syrian solartheology. In this schema the Sun god is both central and ‘first’ in rank. The relationship betweenHecate and Apollo is necessarily simplified for comparative purposes; this cosmogony has ThreeWorlds, and Hecate is present in and key to all of them. One might say that the relationship of themale god of each level with her confirms their power. Kingship as a contract between hero and GreatGoddess was discussed more fully in Geosophia.This model, wherein Sun and Moon are pre-eminent among the planetary gods, underlies all thelater ones. It is important to note the descent of the Sun god from first to second and then to thirdplace. At the same time however the practicalities of theurgy resembled the older rites; Apollo andHecate were the deities most prominent in ritual. So it remains with the grimoires; the planetary godsprovide the structure and demark areas of work, while the solar angel Michael is honoured aboveregular planetary angels. The Christian deity’s relation to Michael is the cabalistic equivalent of therelation of Zervan and Ahura-Mazda to Mithras and the Chaldean Apollo respectively.The solunar emphasis distinguishes the archaic model underlying Theurgy and Hermeticism frommore fatalistic schemas dominated by the planetary forces. The deities of Sun and Moon far exceedthem in power and importance; for the luminaries possess redemptive power over fate.While theurgic ritual frequently resembles general magical practice as manifested in the papyri,such practice neither exists nor develops in a vacuum. Various pre-existent cultural forces inform thisconsensus magic, involving varied beliefs within a cosmopolitan community. However, the ritualinterpreted by the Theurgists is much more than a mélange. Lewy held that immediately below theinterpretations of the theurgists is an earlier Syrian solar theology. There is much truth in this,although it can scarcely be doubted that both Orphic and Egyptian solar conceptions play aconsiderable part.Our examination of the rituals will involve drawing out the older elements and clarifying the layers.The primal cult aspect will be the main concern, with some attention paid to the superimposed layersas they relate to grimoire practice.Careful use of the table opposite is very revealing concerning the structure of religious ideas in lateantiquity.

So far as the grimoire literature specifically isconcerned, they are found in both the Hygromanteia and Liber Juratus, far predating Weyerand Agrippa, and the grimoires that postdate them. While Juratus uses unfamiliar names thisdoes not indicate a different idea. While unanticipated perhaps by modern practitioners, traditionallyspirits often had multiple names – even secret identities – which while confusing is undoubtedly afeature of the literature from earliest times. Dispelling some of the confusion surrounding theelemental chiefs is the purpose of this section of the current work.In the case of the Hygromanteia the names are instantly recognisable. They represent an importantstrand of the subject as it appears in various later grimoires.The Chiefs according to the HygromanteiaEASTNORTHWESTSOUTHLoutzipherAsmodaiAstarothBelzeboulIn his study of the grimoire, Joseph Peterson observes that the three chiefs of the GV are probablyderived from this group, with the omission of Asmodai. This is certainly one of the many ways inwhich the True Grimoire reflects very early traditions of the Solomonic cycle. At the same time wemust be aware of similar absences and failures of correlation in other grimoires. A threefold andfourfold hierarchy appear to co-exist from the beginning, with some crossovers.Typhon, Echidna, and Python, being the progeny of Tartaros and Gaia, who were united byUranos, form, as it were, a certain Chaldean Triad, the inspector of all the disordered forms.Chaldean Oracles, 74"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Greek names conceal older identities, yet this trinity of the oracle, resolved into a single ‘inspector,’is reminiscent of the Maioral in Kimbanda. There is certainly no reason to dismiss the hierarchicaldetails of the True Grimoire as inferior in any respect, especially given the confusion apparent inother grimoires. Indeed its recently demonstrated capacity to take goetic studies forwards commendsit.One of the most significant examples of a fourfold division of spirits and chiefs is in another highlyregarded work, the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. While not without difficulties, thisexample is most interesting, as the chiefs of several different texts appear there together.The Chiefs according to AbramelinFRENCH TITLES GERMAN TITLESPrincesLuciferLeviatanSatanBelialFour KingsSub-PrincesAstarotMagotAsmodeeBelzebud4/8 DukesSub-PrincesOriensPaimonAritonAmaimon4/8 DukesNo attribution to directions or elements is given in Abramelin; also the column format in the Germanedition obscures the two sets of dukes. I suspect all editions may involve slight misplacements in therows, more severely in the columns. Leviathan of course would certainly best suit elemental water(column of Ariton).Among other notable features of this source is that the second line follows the chiefs in theHygromanteia except that Lucifer has been replaced by Magot aka Magoa.Note too that different early Christian sources, as well as Jewish ones, differ as to whetherBelzebuth or Asmodeus is the single chief of demons. It is necessary to appreciate the degree towhich they are interchangeable, with Samael as well as with each other, within the traditionsconcerned. One Midrash in which Asmodeus serves this role in a Jewish context also includes apreliminary meeting of Solomon with a male and a female demon, a parallel to Beelzeboul’s role inthe Testament of Solomon. In any case they remain prominent in later demonology, which has a morecomplex hierarchy that integrates various traditions. Contradictions inevitably arise butcommonalities permit a fairly stable pattern to emerge. It is not unlikely in the least that this or asimilar fourfold division (with one integral superior) dates from at least the fourth century, despite itsseeming absence from the Testament.The third line is the same group as given in Agrippa, which has wide currency in a variety ofgrimoires, give or take some variants of name and attribution. There is no doubt in either source thatAstaroth is counted among the most prominent spirits. This is also the case with the True Grimoireand elsewhere. The Goetia of Solomon is no exception to this rule. Weyer, main source of theGoetia’s spirit catalogue, simply deliberately scrambled and cut an earlier list of spirits. The outrightomission of Lucifer and Belzebuth was noted as early as Scot if not before.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the spirits the Goetia of Solomon takes from Weyer are arandom selection where chiefs and kings are lumped in with subordinates without differentiation. Inother words despite its many interesting features, when it comes to understanding the spirit hierarchyspecifically it is by far the least reliable source. The use of the title Duke among many superiorspirits in the German Abramelin is very helpful in resolving difficulties originating with the jumbled"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Tspirit list of the Goetia. Since clarifying the traditional hierarchy is a work in progress, the termArch-Duke is useful to distinguish known superiors from others.LBS & LBA, OR TRIPLICITIES & QUADRUPLICITIESHE WORK OF SKINNER & RANKINE presents us with a dichotomy. Much is made of the manuscripts ofDoctor Rudd, where a group of three possesses great status, namely Lucifer, Belzebuth andSatan (L:B:S). This appears to be a variant of a similar group, namely Lucifer, Belzebuth andAstaroth (L:B:A). Both forms can be found in various grimoires, L:B:S being mirrored in the highlyinteresting Livre des Esperitz (French, 16th century), which has a related spirit catalogue and ahierarchy featuring the Four Kings (and seemingly omits Astaroth altogether). In Stephen Skinner’scontribution to Both Sides of Heaven, the L:B:S trio is first mentioned as being independent ofangelic authority, they rule in their own right. Here Skinner and I are in complete accord. A difficultyfollows however when in the same article the number is brought back up to four.Sloane MS 3824DIRECTIONEastWestSouthNorthCHIEFSathanLuciferBeelzebubDansiationKINGOriensPaymonAmaymonEgin It should be noted that the Four Kings are specifically mentioned alongside the directions in the MS;this agrees with Agrippa and other sources. So far, so good, but inferring that the four greater chiefshere are either correctly identified or reliably attributed in the same order does not follow. Firstly,Lucifer’s association with the East in earlier sources has far greater authority (the L:B:S acronymalso makes more sense if Lucifer comes before Satan in the table). Also, judging from other worksmade available by this industrious duo, the possibility that Dansiation is a variant of Dantalion seemsreasonably high. This spirit is among those the Goetia adds to Weyer’s list, which probably indicatesrapid promotion rather than a traditional place in the superior hierarchy.Meanwhile Peterson, in his edition of Verum, argues that the L:B:A trinity derives from a group offour spirits in Greek manuscripts; Asmodeus being somehow lost in transmission. There are certainlylinks between the Chiefs and the Kings, even though the L:B:A trinity is also known from Byzantinesources (LDA 267; Delatte’s Anecdota 459–460 from P f146v.). At its simplest, there is a group ofthree to four Chiefs and another of four – never three – Kings. Together or separately they form thebasis of several inter-related traditions. Thus for my part L:B:A and the Four Kings given by Agrippahas been the most useful place to start a close examination of the default hierarchy of a long-lived andinterconnected genre; the grimoires and their sources. Bear in mind none of this was explored by the19th century revival, and work in the 20th century began rather late. Add to this the fact that the bestinformed investigators have only considered comparing notes fairly recently.The best way forward as things appear to me, is to work with the three Chiefs (L:B:A) and fourKings, not as superimposed layers, but as distinct aspects of the hierarchy (see TG, ‘A Unified"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Hierarchy of Goetic Spirits’ and its fourth table). This is mirrored in astrology by the division of thezodiac into quadruplicities (fourfold, elemental) and triplicities (threefold, alchemical: cardinal,fixed and mutable). As an association with astrology is far more fundamental to the spirits thanQabalah; the analogy is therefore apt, and potentially far reaching in future research.Asmodai, as previously mentioned, takes a similar role to Belzebuth in Jewish demonology and isalso not present in the L:B:S/L:B:A triads. Such factors suggest that when present he can be closer innature to the elemental kings; with whom the three chiefs also have commonalities. The indicationsthroughout the genre – for example in Weyer where Asmodeus and Amaymon have an affinity –suggest it would be better to regard the leadership of the elemental or directional kingdoms as a courtor staff, rather than an autocracy."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"TTHE TESTAMENT OF SOLOMONAnd one of us He commanded that we should teach Noah all their medicines ...

As such, despitedifficulties and corruptions, it is of incalculable importance for that tradition. As Solomonicmagic is a major element of Western magic as a whole, the Testament’s importance cannoteasily be overstated. There are however internal contradictions within the Testament. Also there areimportant but misunderstood or overlooked themes at work in the text. As some of the followingdiscussion is intended to clarify, there are also senses in which the Testament as commonly known isnot best understood as a magical text.The following chapters are not primarily an analysis of the ToS but of its spirit catalogue,individual spirits within it and the subsequent influence upon grimoire spirit hierarchies. My reading– while serving distinct purposes – acknowledges the recent ground breaking work of Todd E. Klutz(RTS); as well as McCown, Duling, Arnold and Greenfield. However, my purpose is not literaryexegesis but rather to trace the influence of the text on subsequent grimoires. Especially as a startpoint to re-evaluating the Kings and Queens of the grimoires; in an era when the former are scarcelyunderstood and the latter almost entirely overlooked.References to variant manuscripts and recensions by letters as followed in academia are kept to aminimum. These technicalities are bewildering enough even with the relevant reference material tohand. So too I make only minor use of chapter numbers. The most readily available text for thegeneral reader – that of Conybeare, which happily is derived from Klutz’s preferred manuscript –does not employ them. For reference I primarily employ the verse numbers of Conybeare’s text.Reference to the relevant sources can rectify this omission should the reader wish to pursue it. Iprefer instead to indicate identifiable passages and events in the text while retaining intelligibility forthe lay reader. The relevant text of the Testament is found as an appendix in Vol. II, permitting sideby side consultation.Summarising, from at least the 1st to late 2nd century CE two sections of the Testament appear tohave circulated independently as authentically Jewish texts. These are the opening part, in which theKing encounters Ornias, and the oldest part of the text: Solomon’s interviews with the thirty-sixdecans, or the world-rulers of darkness. These differ remarkably both in genre and point of viewfrom other sections and most particularly the final part. Following these distinctions, the Testament’sdevelopment and its internal problems are considerably clarified. Essentially Klutz puts forward thewell argued position that a later redaction adapted the older text(s) with the specific intention ofundermining Solomon’s status; that of patron of a Jewish tradition of magical medicine founded onastrological principles. Torijano shows how the figure of Solomon as exorcist derives from equatinghim with Hellenistic kings; who assumed some of the attributes of the ‘divine man.’ The literaryprototypes of this figure were of course Empedocles and Pythagoras. The portrayal of Solomon asHellenistic king also explains the origins of amulets portraying Solomon on horseback."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MABesides the anti-Solomonic editing, subsequent pro-Solomonic versions made further adjustmentsto the Testament, including merging with the probably nascent Hygromanteia (Klutz, 33). It is forsuch reasons that the literary exegesis is necessary and controversial, as well as bewildering for non-specialists. In the original form of the text Solomon appeared as the revered originator of a system ofmedical magic. The most ancient fragments of the Testament (the earliest is 6th century) generallyconsist only of the decans material, and an origin in Egypt is likely; one manuscript even employs theCoptic month names. As a Hellenistic Jewish work it subsequently incorporated the Ornias episode.Via the influence of the Testament or parallel tradition this can also be found in the Talmud; with theimportant difference that the demon in the Talmudic account is Ashmedai, not Ornias. In any case theJewish Testament has subsequently been heavily amended in the interests of some form of anti-Solomon Christian polemic, perhaps of the 4th century. While subsequently rehabilitated, in the earlyChristian era Solomon represented a serious rival to the healer and exorcist Jesus. Thus differentforms of the text suit quite different agendas, and the academic exegetes have indirectly assistedmodern magicians by clarifying some of this.The Testament and Asia MinorY TAKE ON THE CHRISTIAN POLEMIC departs from that of Klutz mainly in drawing a comparison withthe agenda displayed in Acts of the Apostles 19:13–19. This concerns Saint Paul’s triumphover supposed vagabond Jews of Ephesus. Judging by the context these could well have been‘Solomonic’ healers and exorcists, who moreover certainly possessed magical books (Acts 19:19).Klutz’s scriptural objections to earlier analyses linking the Testament to Ephesus appear more than alittle strained; considering he also cites Acts, regarding cities with magical reputations. My take iscloser to that of Arnold (EPM), who makes an excellent case regarding the importance of Ephesus,including the high status of Artemis in magic and religion of the period. As regards the latter, hisinsight that the zodiacal symbols on statues of Artemis Ephesia represent superiority to fate deservesspecial emphasis. His work also clarifies the importance of understanding Jewish diasporainvolvement in magic in Asia Minor when interpreting Saint Paul. The implications however reachfar beyond biblical exegesis, including the origins – and original nature – of Solomonic magic, and ofgrimoire angels.EphesusRNOLD QUOTES BRUCE MANNING METZGER: Of all ancient Græco-Roman cities, Ephesus, the thirdlargest city in the Empire, was by far the most hospitable to magicians, sorcerers, andcharlatans of all sorts. Similarly he cites Otto Meinardus: Perhaps even more than PisidianAntioch, Corinth, and Antioch-on-the-Orontes, this city ... swarmed with soothsayers andpurveyors of charms. The mention of Pisidian Antioch, putative birthplace of Saint Cyprian, addsfurther interest to this passage. To summarise, Arnold makes an excellent case for Ephesus as theleading magical centre for Asia Minor, in which the goddess of the city played a major role, withinfluence extending throughout the region and internationally.Klutz’s citations downplay Ephesus, making much of the region of Samaria’s links with SimonMagus (Acts 8:4–24) and of Paphos with the sorcerer Elymas. I grant that Samaritan magic deservesmore study than often meted out (some of what we take to be Kabbalistic magic is likely old"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ESamaritan magic pure and simple). Nevertheless, his case that in Acts these cities exceed Ephesus –where Paul’s two year mission is plainly in part anti-magical – relies solely upon the presence of asingle named magician. This is no argument whatever if the magic encountered in Ephesus – whosereputation for magic and magical books in Acts is unquestionable – was Solomonic. Solomonic magicis an important topic, and the name of Solomon larger – and more problematic – than Simon andElymas. Moreover, Paul’s mission in Asia Minor – exemplified by Acts, Galatians and Colossians –involved powers and principalities; angelic titles that epitomise the Jewish-pagan fusion in AsiaMinor and are deeply influential on the conceptions encountered in the papyri. These angels includebig names, Jewish angels; Michael, Raphael and Uriel; and the Greek angels Artemis and Hecate. Allare plainly relevant to the Testament of Solomon.Artemis, Hecate and Jewish magicPHESUS – where Paul opposed ‘Solomonic’ magicians – was the major city of the Romanprovince of Asia Minor, the location of Artemis Ephesia’s temple; one of the seven wonders ofthe ancient world. Additionally the Ephesia Grammata, famous words of power, originatedthere. Some of them appear in the Testament of Solomon, which also names the snare into whichSolomon fell: the bonds of Artemis. Arnold quotes Anaxilas regarding the Ephesia Grammata inrelation to fine Ephesian charms in little sewed bags, a detail that cannot but incite comparison withHoodoo mojo bags. Arnold, concurring with an Ephesian linkage to the ToS is not alone either insuggesting linkage of Jewish magic with veneration of Hecate (CS 145) with whom Ephesian Artemisis linked (CS 143) by syncretism and the presence of a Hecate shrine at the temple &c.A powerful piece of evidence from Asia Minor is the complex, multipart Pergamon magicalapparatus (EPM 16, CS 63–64, 143). As well as three amulets with names of Jewish angels, thebronze table and apparatus bears images of Hecate and praise phrases from her cult. Arnold also seesas Jewish the amulet, found at an Ostian compitales (crossroads shrine), and mentioned by Peterson,Skinner and Rankine (VKS 27) and myself, important for bearing images of both Solomon and Hecate.Ostia of course was a very cosmopolitan Roman port, where a sizeable Jewish population may beassumed.Arnold points to other contexts where a juncture of Jewish magic and Hecate occur. This includesPGM texts (such as XXXVI.187–210). This casts added light upon the precinct of Mēn at PisidianAntioch, as also the Jewish sybil at Thyatira. Mēn was seen as a pagan high god in some forms of thecult and it is interesting to note that Mēne is a title of Hecate, used in PGM VII.756–94, possiblyillustrating such Jewish connections with Phrygian magic, mystery cults &c. I have remarked on thelunar pantheism of this rite elsewhere. Such evidence might well indicate syncretism of Mēn withIAO. Bonner, whose work on ancient amulets is formidable, mentions an amulet with an image ofHecate and the inscription: IAO, Sabaoth, protect. This is by no means unusual. That Hecate bore thetitle of angel (as does Artemis in the PGM) suggests a route into Jewish folk magic, with other paganprincipalities and powers, standing beside more conventional Jewish angels (themselves suspect inChristian eyes for many centuries).Magic, Jewish and Pagan"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"TO RETURN TO THE TESTAMENT, in fact the Christian polemic and its antecedents do not represent a twosided monotheistic dispute; as the central role of Ephesian Artemis (the Roman Diana ofEphesus) in both Acts and the Testament amply demonstrates. It is certainly true that Jewishmagic had absorbed pagan elements that might facilitate Christian attacks on a wholly Jewishaudience. However we should be wary of assuming that Christian polemicists were only concernedwith correcting the errors of their fellow monotheists. Comparison of the equally polemicalConfession of Saint Cyprian with the Testament is instructive. To the Christian polemicists bothArtemis and Solomon must bow to a higher magic. Several times while undermining Solomon thefalse worship of the pagans – who mistake the demons for deities – is also stressed. So too isSolomon’s fall into this same snare (of Artemis), and of the whole world until the coming of Christ.According to this polemic – which defines the final form of the Testament – Solomon’s magic did notsave him, and its power perished with his fall. The rule of the demons then resumed until Christ cameto triumph over them. Comparison with the Confession of Cyprian reveals similar disputes at work,concerning Christianity and specifically pagan magic (Theurgy and Hermeticism). From thesedisputes a strange contrast emerges between the fall of Solomon and the beatitude of Cyprian. Themagician, always, is too close to the pagan and demonic; what differs is the last things – theirindividual eschatology.While I have no objection to identifying Egypt as the home of the older Jewish parts of the ToS,Ephesus has to be seriously considered as the location of the later polemic, supplying significantparts of the dramatis personæ. This aspect of the question brings in Asia Minor in both Jewish andChristian traditions, several aspects of which emerge elsewhere in this study. Somewhat reluctantly,as in Geosophia, I must neglect Montanism and only lightly touch on Chaldean or Jewish sibyls. Thisintroduction to such issues must be sufficient; the textual examination itself must be copious enough.Now to move swiftly from introduction to examination; raising further salient points on the hoof.The work begins by introducing itself and its author:1 Testament of Solomon, son of David, who was king in Jerusalem, and mastered and controlledall spirits of the air, on the earth, and under the earth. By means of them also he wrought all thetranscendent works of the Temple. Telling also of the authorities they wield against men, and bywhat angels these demons are brought to naught.Here it is worth noting how of the air, on the earth, and under the earth bears a close resemblanceto the Headless Ritual (PGM V.96–172). So too a defining principle of the magico-medicalmethodology, pitting angel against disease demon, is stated clearly. There follows an account of howSolomon met with the demon Ornias; who, however he came to be here, so far as I can ascertain isnot a figure of preceding Jewish demonology. By verse five Solomon is seeking wisdom and powerto command demons and receives a magical ring from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his archangel.With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help thoushalt build up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wear this seal of God. And this engraving of theseal of the ring sent thee is a Pentalpha.By the power of the ring he obtains power over Ornias, and sends him to fetch the chief of thedemons, Beelzeboul. Beelzeboul in turn brings Onoskelis and Asmodeus. Sarah Iles Johnston’s well"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"supported remarks on this deserve quotation:... just as Solomon receives the ring that empowers him to command demons from God, so do themagicians who used curse tablets rely on Hecate, Hermes and other gods to compel the deadsouls to do their bidding.After this Solomon speaks again with Beelzeboul before a long parade of demons is introduced.Beelzeboul’s second interview with Solomon separates the chief of spirits plus Ornias, Onoskelisand Asmodeus from the main spirit catalogue; including, for example, the spirits of the 36 decans. Ofthe four, Beelzeboul and Asmodeus are instantly recognisable from sets of chiefs and kings ruling theother spirits in various grimoires. It is tempting to see in Ornias’ name a distortion of Oriens, anotherof these kings, and in Onoskelis an alias of Astaroth. This would make the four first named spirits theprototypes of the chiefs and kings of later hierarchies.The Chiefs according to the HygromanteiaEASTNORTHWESTSOUTHLoutzipherAsmodaiAstarothBelzeboulAccording to AbramelinFRENCH TITLES GERMAN TITLESPrincesLuciferLeviatanSatanBelialFour KingsSub-PrincesAstarotMagotAsmodeeBelzebud4/8 DukesSub-PrincesOriensPaimonAritonAmaimon4/8 DukesTempting though this is, it is as well for the present to merely note the possibility. Nevertheless, thesespirits are separated from the main catalogue by the reappearance of the ultimate chief, and the namesOrnias and Onoskelis both reoccur in the Hygromanteia. Oriens in any case is also known from theMSS tradition of the Hygromanteia (IA 287, note 6).The traditions present in the Testament continue in the Hygromanteia, wherein Astaroth is countedamong the four chief rulers of spirits. So too the latter text bears traces of the old planetary gods,though under the authority of the One. It describes Venus as female, and makes other more significantreferences to female entities. They may be Neoplatonist potencies of God, but equally they arepersonified and possess gender and attributes, like astrologically interpreted Olympians. Thepresence of the planetary gods, in what is essentially a Christian Neoplatonist form, has excited someattention. The presence of familiar chiefs, including the controversial figure of Astaroth, has alsoreceived comment. There are other figures present whose importance is only beginning to emerge.Among the most significant are figures from the spirit catalogue of the Testament, in particularOnoskelis.The following table identifies the spirits of the Testament of Solomon among whom, for reasonsthat will become clear, I include Sheba, though represented as a mortal queen in the text itself."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Pleiades and decans are numbered in grey as sub-groups as well as within the overall listing.Sheba/Sympilia is in square brackets as a special case.

The Testament material aside, themore developed lore surrounding him is known from the Hygromanteia, especially in relation to thefemale demon Onoskelis, of whom more anon. Via the Talmud he can also be identified withAsmodeus, who requires an extended section after this overall survey of the spirit catalogue. Thisidentity may well support the case for linking Ornias and Oriens. As regards the ToS, Ornias plays animportant role in the opening and closing anti-Solomonic interpolations.BeelzeboulHE TESTAMENT mirrors the demonology of the New Testament in making Beelzeboul chief ofdemons. That this was a common belief in contemporary Galilee seems likely enough, thoughthere is little mention of him in the Old Testament. Indeed Asmodeus or Samael, as well asSemjaza, may as easily be identified as the chief Jewish devil. Some overlapping of roles is apparentin variant manuscripts of this particular text, as well as in wider demonological lore. These technicalities aside, the Testament establishes him as a key figure in many later spirithierarchies. This role has been fairly well delineated in my True Grimoire, and is reprised bygrimoire materials in these volumes. As regards his role in the Testament there remainscomparatively little to say. It is notable that despite the power of his ring and of thwarting angels,Solomon’s authority over demons derives in part directly from Beelzeboul. This can be perceivedplainly in his first interview with the spirit.15: And I questioned him, and said: Who art thou? The demon replied: I am Beelzeboul, theexarch of the demons. And all the demons have their chief seats close to me. And I it is whomake manifest the apparition of each demon. And he promised to bring to me in bonds allthe unclean spirits. And I again glorified the God of heaven and earth, as I do always give thanksto him.There is an item of interest also in Solomon’s subsequent discussions with Beelzeboul. Solomon bidshim to:Discourse to me about the things in heaven. And Beelzeboul said: Hear, O king, if thou burn"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Sgum, and incense, and bulb of the sea, with nard and saffron, and light seven lamps in a rowthou wilt firmly fix thy house. And if, being pure, thou lightest them at dawn in the sunlight,thou wilt see then the heavenly dragons, winding themselves along and dragging the chariot ofthe sun. And I Solomon, having heard this, rebuked him, and said: Silence for this present.D.C. Duling interprets Solomon’s rebuke as indicating the magical means to fix thy house isforbidden – presumably pagan – magic. Unfortunately he does not enlarge on this; however I came toa very similar conclusion, while exploring the little known technical hermetic text, the Sacred Book(not to be confused with the later grimoire, Liber Sacer) to be elucidated in Book 3. Meanwhile, theconnection of the sun with a chariot drawn by celestial dragons is noteworthy. In artistic conventionthe chariot of Helios was drawn by horses, imitated in mosaics upon some ancient synagogue floors,reflecting Hellenising tendencies in contemporary Judaism. This passage however appears to alludemore specifically to the chariot of Medea, who was of the family of Helios. Her status as supremeenchanter with roots and plants indicates the magic forbidden here.OnoskelisOLOMON’S MEETING with Onoskelis is a critical encounter; it arises through Solomon askingBeelzeboul if there are females among the demons. This spirit is thus the exemplar of a femalespirit in the subsequent grimoire tradition. While representing a strong individual identity, thename was originally a title of the Greek Empusa, connecting it to lamia lore of various strands; thename means She of the ass’s legs, and unusual feet and legs are strongly associated with lamiæ ingeneral. Both Psuedo-Plutarch’s Scholiast on Aristophanes (3rd to 4th CE) and the Byzantine HistoriaEcclesiastica of Sozemenos (400–450 CE) mention Onoskelis in connection with Ephesus. It wouldappear from these references that she was part of local tradition contemporary with the Testament.Onoskelis of course is also known from the Byzantine Solomonic grimoire, the Hygromanteia. Thisis unsurprising, as overlapping or transformation stages between Testament and Hygromanteiaappear in several manuscripts; the latter is at least partly derived from and inspired by the former.This is important for our understanding of the origins of Solomonic magic, but also the relativeimportance and antiquity of the principal dramatis personæ. Significantly, in the Hygromanteiaappear listed magical properties of plants attributed to the zodiacal signs. Among these is aprescription for protection from Onoskelis (MTS 199, 333). These astrological treatments are notdissimilar in orientation at least from Testament magical medicine, suggesting they are early andimportant parts of the Hygromanteia. In one version of the grimoire (MS Neopolitanus II c.33) a ceremonial basin divination has beenadded to the text as it exists in other manuscripts (MTS 135). This ritual, while not strictly part of theHygromanteia, evidently reflects a shared background of magical lore in which Onoskelis isprominent. The ritual is both necromantic and spectacular, and is worth quoting for several reasons:At the first hour of the first day, when the Sun is rising, take a new and empty basin. Then go toan old meeting of three roads, dig a pit and put the basin inside. Find a black horse at night.Ride it, while holding a human bone. You must say the following: Xerion, Ariem, Salphrenas,Moroes, Mizxaoul, Emntdbl, Phorel, Phereel, Narkisou, Xympona, Saraphael, Berzebouel,Mounokhoth, Alael, Misoklesous, the demons of the West, the demons of Aries, the demons ofthe great Hades, the first among whom is the one called Orneas; Theth, Maldouor, Phartouel,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ASarsanna, Karkinar, and his offspring Onoskelis; in the name Semiramel, O demons of themeetings of three roads, come to answer me.Do not be afraid, but concentrate. You must also speak to them. When you are finished, recite:Fiery chariots of heaven and king Sabaoth, Tetragrammaton, Eis Nazareos, Neos.Understand and divide.There are many striking features in this rite, some of which I have emphasised for ease of reference.The ritual takes place where three roads meet. It specifically directs itself towards invoking spirits ofsuch a location. These places were under the jurisdiction of Hecate and there can be no doubt that thisis understood here. The name of the chief of spirits – according to the Testament and echoed in muchlater texts – is invoked. Orneas – a variant of Ornias in the Testament – is named specifically as aperson of importance. Indeed this reference may contradict what appears to be the treatment of him asa rank and file spirit in the Hygromantiea (MTS 101, 280). Onoskelis is then named as his offspring; the his I believe refers to Orneas, who is named before thecolon and string of names preceding. In any case such a familial relationship between spirits is notuntypical of the demonology of the ancient period. In other words, the spirit possesses a myth of theirown, such as is rarely found in the impersonal listings of the later Western grimoires. Thesesuggestions of a fuller and detailed background suit the extended appearance of Onoskelis in theTestament. Clearly she is an individual of some importance. Finally it is reiterated that the spiritsinvoked, Orneas and Onoskelis included, are spirits of the three road locus ruled by Hecate. Which isto say they are prominent lares compitales, (see Geosophia, Book 6).AsmodeusFTER ONOSKELIS, there is an important encounter with Asmodeus. He is such an important spiritthat it will be necessary to return to him, as well as examining his place in the text. WhenSolomon asks the spirit, brought in bonds before him, to tell him who he is, Asmodeus retorts,with a malevolent glance: and who art thou?Solomon remonstrates with the spirit, demanding an answer and receives the following eloquentreply:But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man; whereas I was born an angel’s seed bya daughter of man, so that no word of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born is tooproud. Wherefore also my star is bright in heaven, and men call it, some the Wain, and somethe dragon’s child. I keep near unto this star. So ask me not many things; for thy kingdom alsoafter a little time is to be disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season. And short will be thytyranny over us; and then we shall again have free range over mankind, so that they revere usas if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the angels set over us.This is an important speech in several respects. Firstly, it is informative regarding the Christianredactor’s view of demons, as identical with the entities revered by pagans. In the self same line theconcept of thwarting angels commanding the demons occurs again. While the ToS is the origin of thisparadigm within Solomonic magic, in all likelihood theurgic hierarchy rather than dualist oppositionbetween angel and demon was the original operative mainspring. There is ample literary andarchaeological evidence that such a concept and process was commonly applied to the decans."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"TAsmodeus also contributes to the discourse concerning the fall of Solomon. That he rather thanOnoskelis does so is significant, but other factors must also be considered. Foremost, Asmodeus isnot infrequently encountered in company with a female demon. Solomon’s fall is connectedthroughout with Artemis, who is thoroughly identified with Hecate, Persephone and Selene in thePGM and thus a crucial figure of magical cult – much the same may be said of Hecate’s role in theChaldean Oracles. Asmodeus links the grimoire tradition back to key concepts of the GreatSynthesis; intimately connected with our discussion of kings and queens of the grimoires. Hisimportance in this respect may be gauged by Kimbanda’s syncretic equivalents of Asmodeus andLilith: Exu Rei da Kalunga Pequeña and Pomba Gira Rainha da Kalunga Pequeña; Exu and PombaGira as King and Queen of the Cemetery.There follows a point in the text stressed in the Introduction. This is Solomon’s second interviewwith Beelzeboul, whom he seats in a place of honour. Beelzeboul speaks of destroying kings andinducing holy men and leaders to sin, evidently part of the overall discourse regarding Solomon’sfall. A full discussion of these passages and the embedded themes to which they relate is beyond ourpurposes.Another spirit is then mentioned, and the stage set for his future appearance. This is the spirit namedEphippas. His name translates as on horseback; this is interpreted by Klutz as part of the demolitionjob on Solomon, who appeared as the horseman slaying demons on amulets in use by certaincommunities the polemic addressed. While important in the context of the former author’s work, nogreat purpose for us is served by extending this part of the discussion so we may move on.Lix Tetrax OR TephrasHE NAME OF THIS SPIRIT (vs. 33) varies in the manuscripts, and it is one of many complex passages ofthe Testament. The form Lix Tetrax is yet another linkage of the background of the text with themagical cult of Artemis (identical in this period with Hecate). Lix Tetrax’s name isunquestionably derived from the magical Ephesia Grammata; known from the 4th–5th century BCE:ASKION, KATASKION, LIX, TETRAX, DAMNAMENEUS, AISIA.These magical words take their name from the city of Ephesus, famous for the Temple of Artemis(Diana to the Romans and thus also the New Testament), upon whose statue this formula waslegendarily found. It has been supposed that at some point a scribe of the Testament mistook wordsfor names. However, another of the Ephesia Grammata is Damnameneus, the name of an Idaean dactylinvoked frequently in the PGM. There is in any case ample evidence that words of power employedin magic are often simultaneously envisaged as entities. The connection with Ephesus is one of manyin the text; what stage of composition they collectively represent is for experts to determine.There is however, more to the picture. The materials incorporated at this point in the Testamentappear to reflect pagan practice. This is supported by the extremely marked deviation from theformula: demon inflicted illness bound by angel. There is first an introduction, of a piece with manyin the text, the demon is brought forth, tells of its natural ill doings. However, when bidden to tell ofhis astrological nature he complies and then volunteers additional information:For I have been bidden to restrain the convulsions of the hemitertian fever; and this is whymany men pray to the hemitertian fever, using these three names: Bultala, Thallal, Melchal.And I heal them.While there is a formula, there is no mention of the demon being responsible for causing the illness,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Sonly healing it. Solomon, however, appears more interested in the harm the spirit can do!And I said to him: I am Solomon; when therefore thou wouldst do harm, by whose aid dost thoudo it? But he said to me: By the angel’s, by whom also the third day’s fever is lulled to rest.Things get no more straightforward when Solomon inquires regarding the identity of this angel.So I questioned him, and said: And by what name [are you controlled]? And he answered: Thatof the archangel Azael. And I summoned the archangel Azael, and set a seal on the demon.Perhaps the text is merely corrupted, and the archangel’s part in things misunderstood? That does notappear to be nearly sufficient explanation. The archangel is in fact no other than a chief of the fallenangels in numerous works of Jewish magic and Kabbalah. He is one of the princes of devils offensivein the elements in Agrippa. The name is known from a parallel, rabbinical form of the Four Kings:Samael, Azazel, Azael, and Mahazael, who appear in Enoch, Saint Irenaus (plainly identified as theFour Kings), the Zohar and elsewhere. He has been identified directly with Semjaza/Shemhazai, andappears in Faustian grimoires. Keep in mind that Lix Tetrax requires the aid of Azael in doing harmas well as healing. All considered, if Lix Tetrax is a devil (rather than a dactyl), then Azael wouldappear to be one of the arch-devils to whom he is responsible. In other words, their relationship –rather than celestial checking infernal – operates through the chthonic hierarchy alone. This and therelated matter of the Four Kings are both germane to our theme. It is important to note how closelyinterwoven they are in a source document contemporary with the papyri and older than the grimoires.Seven SistersOLOMON then meets with a group who have been tentatively identified with the Pleiades; aptlyenough, since they are seven sisters, who speak of themselves as goddesses. Each may befrustrated by the name of an angel (such, despite the claim of Asmodeus, is not exactly the casefor all the spirits in the catalogue). Of these angels, Lamech is certainly the root of the first angel’sname; Lamech is the father of Tubal Cain, also curiously the supposed son to whom Abramelin wasbequeathed. In the latter connection I am reliably informed that Lamech would never be used as aJewish proper name; a code may therefore be at work. Significantly the fifth or sixth is frustrated bythe power of an angel named Asteraoth. That this is Astaroth appearing in angelic guise should notunduly surprise us; her protective role predated the invoking of angels (see under Obizuth, below andpassim).The seventh on the other hand gives no such information. She speaks of the fall of Solomon, snaredin the bonds of Artemis. This is Artemis as lunar goddess of witchcraft, synonymous with Hecate.This prediction of Solomon’s fall anticipates the climax of the text. As seen the biblical account of hisdescent into idolatry mentions Ashtoreth and specifies her gender. The Testament plainly equatesHecate, Astaroth and Artemis, and their role in Solomon’s career is strongly underlined throughout. Inother words, the female gender of Astaroth is central and critical to the legend of Solomon. As theToS is a foundational text of Solomonic magic this is a powerful counter to the argument of someceremonial magicians that she be considered a) male as – apparently – in the Goetia, and b) distinctfrom any Pagan deity. Indeed the Testament enables us to determine just which such deity Astarothrepresents at this formative stage of the grimoire tradition."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"NO.NAMEFUNCTIONANGEL1stApateDeceiver, hereticLamechalal/Lamechiel2ndErisStirring strifeBarochiachel/Barouchchiel3rdKlothodMaking enmity and separationMarmarath4thZaleIntoxicator, aiding Erisgreat Balthiel/Balthioul5thPlane*Error, necromancy, evilUriel/Ouriel6thDynamis*Power, raising up & tearing downtyrantsAsteraoth7thKaxisteLigatures?Withheld* There is some disagreement of placing with fifth and sixth, the attributes remain consistent.In my view the material concerning the Pleiades – or whatever else the Seven Sisters may represent –remains partly problematic. While astrological and employing some parallel terms it differs stronglyfrom the decan material and, while embodying some genuine traditions, may be a deliberate pastiche.It offers little help in terms of understanding the origins of the Testament. It appears to serve theinterests of the Christian polemicist, but contains both pagan astrological material and possibleJewish elements. There has been considerable speculation; this extends to questioning if the Pleiadesrather than the planets were the original seven; Ursa Major cannot be discounted. Klutz does not muchdiscuss the verses concerned, although he makes one cogent remark. They are differentiated from thedecans by different use of similar terminology. He points out that whereas the decans are denominatedthe world rulers of the darkness of this age, that is the cosmokraters or archons, the Seven Sistersidentify themselves as elements of the world ruler of darkness. In other words they serve and areparts of a singular figure, identified with Satan, whereas the autonomous cosmokraters belong to aless homogenised schema. I differ from Klutz in considering this older schema no less organised,though his distinction as to type certainly stands. In origin it is pagan, involving solar-pantheism.Subsequently it is a salient feature of Sabean magic such as Picatrix, and a powerful formativeinfluence on the grimoires; readily detectable in spirit hierarchies, talismanic forms &c. Thisinvolves a well structured cosmogony that generates magical correspondences (sympathia).Among the decans of the Testament Conybeare delivers there appear various lacunæ. One of theseis in Taurus, a position appropriate to the constellation of the Pleiades. Even so, the versesconcerning the seven sisters in the Testament are plainly not misplaced from those regarding thedecans, which constitute the oldest, once independent, part of the text. The textual considerations aretoo complex, and far from our main themes, to pursue further. This is not to say we have heard the lastof the constellation in question. This instance should warn us however that while there is a decanlisting in the text, other spirits of the Testament may also relate to the decan genre, or prominent fixedstars associated with it.The Headless Spirit"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"SOLOMON’S NEXT ENCOUNTER is with a Headless Demon (Akephelos Daimon) who is important in avariety of contexts. Here we shall discuss his role in the text, although as will be seen, thisalso leads us further afield. This spirit speaks of service at the crossways (the word used isenodiais, related to Hecate’s name of Enodia). Obviously this concerns Hecate and the crossroads asa magical site. It is magic of a type of which the Christian interpolator evidently disapproves, andpagan rather than Jewish in origin. In the Hygromanteia, as we have seen, such a site was connectedwith Ornias and Onoskelis. Since the demon performing this service is a headless spirit, the partialdependence of the Testament on major themes of the magical papyri is clear (PGM V.96–172, andpassim). The crossroads role is multivalent in significance, referring also to the four directions andtheir rulers, who may be invoked there.One of the demon’s powers captures Solomon’s attention, and it is not one of healing; it concernsdestructive fire.45: And I Solomon, on hearing this, said to him: Tell me how thou dost discharge forth the fire?Out of what sources dost thou emit it? And the spirit said to me: From the Day-star [or, East].For here hath not yet been found that Elbourion [Elboyrion], to whom men offer prayers andkindle lights. And his name is invoked by the seven demons before me. And he cherishes them.As Conybeare notes, anatole which he translates as Day Star can as easily mean East; interestinglythe name Oriens – King of Fire – has the same ambiguity. I have not had access to other manuscriptsin which this passage occurs (McCown’s synthetic text relegates its occurrence in MS P to a footnote).Nevertheless, the East and the name Elbourion are likely to be relevant to our discussion of the FourKings and related themes. Note that his name is invoked by the seven sisters, who he cherishes. TheHelios-Apollo or Oriens figure commands the four horses of the elements, also the 36 cosmokraters.He is equally master of the seven planets (his name Sabaoth implies this, among other things). That hecherishes the seven sisters could therefore refer to the relations of a planetary court with an Aion orZervan figure.While we are dealing with a composite text, another relationship may explain this passage, which Ibelieve is important. The Pleiades are a very major constellation in the lore regarding the lunarmansions. In several systems it appears they may originally have been the first mansion, just as theSpirit of the East rules the first of the decans. Thus this verse can be interpreted in terms of thesolunar theology underlying Theurgy, that is, the relations of the Sun and Moon, and Apollo andHecate. The first decan or mansion can easily represent the leader of the others, and thus be dedicatedto an important aspect of the deity concerned in both cases. Note for example the appearance of thename Bael as the first of the demons of the Goetia, called their first and principal king.Note too that in the papyri the Headless Demon, with whom we are currently concerned, is highlypantheistic (addressed as a supreme deity – both pagan and Jewish in influence – in whom powerover all elements and directions is centred). Also, like the Headless Demon in the Testament hebreathes fire. In context he represents as it were an avatar of just such a solar and fiery deity asOriens; who might indeed also be addressed as Baal. However there are other considerations. Amongthese is the fact that the decans anciently represented constellations which rise in the East, rather thanrule it. Also, while Oriens and Baal or Bael are names or titles of the Sun god, they are oftendistinguished from one another in the grimoires. Bael – principal king among the subordinate spirits –answers to Oriens as foremost of the Four Kings set over them. The origins of their positions lay inthe solar hierarchy of antiquity, with Helios Apollo a demiurgic figure, the Four Kings representing"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"This rule over the quarters, and Bael of the grimoires the solar leadership of the decans.The Headless One appears in the Sacred Book and the Kyranides as ruler of the first decan ofCapricorn (opposite Sothis), and holds the equivalent position in mansion listings (CodexCromwellianus &c.). This has a double significance. Like other spirits of the Testament, whiledetached from the list identified as decans, the Headless One is a spirit of an identifiable decan.More than this, he is King of one of the cardinal points, properly the South. The association with theEast noted above is confirmatory rather than contradictory; it is where both Sun and decans rise, andassociation with both East and South is typical of Amaymon, Asmodeus and others.Returning to our text, is this figure clearly distinct from the angel supposed to have power over theHeadless Demon? In the ToS it would certainly appear so, although some ambiguity may be found inthe following verse.46: But I said to him: Tell me his name. But he answered: I cannot tell thee. For if I tell hisname, I render myself incurable. But he will come in response to his name. And on hearing this,I Solomon said to him: Tell me then, by what angel thou art frustrated? And he answered: Bythe fiery flash of lightning.This is curious, since not only is the Headless One of the papyri a breather of fire, he is he wholighteneth and thundereth. The closing lines are equally cryptic, the demon has been sealed, whichtook away his sight, hence the reference to being cured above. However it appears that Solomon’spower over him is at least temporarily limited.And I bowed myself before the Lord God of Israel, and bade him remain in the keeping ofBeelzeboul until Iax should come.The demon then is sealed but not bound, so is not allotted a task in the building of the Temple. Apower named Iax may be needed for this to take place.RabdosHE NEXT SPIRIT encountered – who appears as a huge hound, perhaps Anubis or Cerberus – is ofinterest for his claim to have once been a man and magician. This clearly connects spirits of thedead with Solomonic demonology, a feature later diminished or glossed over. His name ofRabdos (staff/rod) may indicate the golden rod of Hermes, which both ‘hounds’ might carry in theirrole of Psychopompos in the papyri. It could also connect him with Tiresias, whose connections withpagan sexuality may have commended him to the polemicist. In any case, the description of his earthlylife could well be intended to criticise Solomon; also, though I doubt anything of the kind is implied,it describes pre-conversion Cyprian.The name Rabdos and the form of a dog implies a further layer of exegesis. The first decan of Canceranciently equated with the station of Sothis; the Dog Star (Sirius has now precessed to the seconddecan by Tropical conventions). A pillar or celestial pole was envisaged as reaching from North toSouth, represented by the first decan of Cancer and Capricorn respectively. Thus just as the HeadlessOne represents the latter, Rabdos may represent a demonised and dislocated decan spirit associatedwith the former. Some elements of the association of doglike spirits with the solsticial signs havebeen covered before (in Geo. 11.6 ‘Nebiros’ re. solstice rites and Anubis).Conybeare dismisses Bornemann’s suggestion that the thwarting angel Brieus is identical with the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"TAGiant Briareus, on the grounds that the latter would not be made an angel. This may be anunwarranted assumption; as we have seen Astaroth was, and other pagan overlaps with connectionsto Asia Minor cannot be discounted. Moreover Briareus – see Geosophia – aided Zeus in defeatingthe Titans, whom he guards. Nevertheless, the name is not stable enough in the MSS to be certain,variants include: Briathoy, Briathayel, Brieo and Briario.The text also appears to be very corrupt; Rabdos reveals the whereabouts of the shamir stone,guarded by a demon. Solomon sends for the stone and the demon. Thereafter there is a sealing of twodemons, but it is Rabdos and the Headless One who are sealed – despite the Headless One havingalready been sealed. What has happened to the spirit brought on the advice of Rabdos?Seemingly the name and details of this second spirit are lost. Might it be that a later copyist ropedin the Headless Spirit from the previous section as a replacement? Or does this overlap furtherconnect the two spirits as representing the North-South polarity? What appears a more likelyexplanation is that originally the spirit brought with the stone was the mysterious Iax, allowingSolomon to complete his work with the Headless Spirit. In this case has Rabdos replaced Iax? Likelywe shall never know, however, we will be hearing of Iax again.Araps or RathHE NEXT SPIRIT APPEARS in the form of a raging lion (Leontophoron). As one of several spiritsconjured by Christian powers rather than Solomonic angels the section clearly involves thework of the polemicists. He is responsible for possession states (and apparently exorcisms,though this passage may be corrupt). He has legions under him, and all may possess the same person.This clearly reflects the New Testament occurrence of a spirit whose name is Legion. The number644 and the name Emmanuel which has that value are potent against him, as are the three letters thatspell the same number in Greek. There is a further reference to the miracle of the Gadarene swine,underlining the fact that this section involves interpolation. He also appears as a demon of the 20thhour of Sunday in the Hygromanteia. Names from the wider decan literature may equate (see the 25thdecan of the ToS 1st Sagittarius). Two amulets from Asia Minor refer to Araaph, which is likely analternative form of Araph (CS 64–67). The first, found in Cyzicus, was discovered at a Romancemetery and has been dated to the second half of the 3rd century; it invokes Michael, Gabriel, Ourieland Raphael, and also names Solomon, who is depicted on horseback. Interestingly Araaph is alsoreferred to as an angel. Images of Helios, Selene and an eye of Horus appear alongside a lion,presumably representing Araps. Near Smyrna another such amulet was found which invokes the LordSabaoth and also names Solomon, but mentions no protective angels. Its Jewish provenance isundisputed, and both amulets provide evidence of Solomonic magic in Asia Minor.Three Headed DragonN IMPORTANT ELEMENT of the polemic occurs in relation to this dragon, as also the Winged Dragonto follow. He is frustrated, like the previous spirit, by Christian formulæ. Elements of thediscourse further underline that the power and prestige of Solomon as healer and exorcist isbeing deliberately undermined in favour of Jesus. He foretells the future appearance of another spirit,Ephippas, already mentioned by Beelzeboul in verse 26.The term dragon in ancient sources is synonymous with serpent, and Christian interpretation of thepagan symbolism is loaded with negative associations from Genesis. Note that the dragon motif alsoappears in the Confession of Saint Cyprian. So too the Red Dragon obviously connects withRevelation and with the blue grimoires. The motif therefore is loaded in various ways: as a negative"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Oemblem of sexuality, idolatry and magic, and as a ‘reclaimed’ emblem of demonic magical power.Rather than grapple with historical and doctrinal issues, our best resort is to redefine the dragons in amanner useful to goetia. This dragon has three heads, which in grimoire symbolism indicatesuniversality (see TBOP III.XVIII, and descriptions of spirits in GoS). This symbolism together with itsorigin in the ToS implies a high status figure or figures of a spirit hierarchy. It is also native to thedecan and mansion tradition; see for example the last decan of Pisces in the Sacred Book (sinuousdragon) and the ninth symbol of PGM VII.756–94).ObizuthBIZUTH APPEARS with her limbs dark or invisible like those of a ghost, only a Medusa head(gorgoneion) is seen. That the spirit is invisible (a ghost) aside from this talismanic mask isthe key to the reversal in play. Essentially the polemical author is saying the pagan protectivedevice is the visible part of the evil spirit. Before turning to this important subject it is well toexamine the preliminaries of the encounter of Solomon with this spirit. As with the dialogue withAsmodeus, when questioned as to her identity, she retorts:Nay, who art thou? And why dost thou want to hear concerning me? But, as thou wouldstlearn, here I stand bound before thy face. Go then into thy royal storehouses and wash thyhands. Then sit down afresh before thy tribunal, and ask me questions; and thou shalt learn, Oking, who I am.In the Who art thou? of Asmodeus and Obizuth it is difficult not to hear echoes of Acts 19:15. ThereJewish magicians attempting an exorcism in competition with Paul are addressed by the spirit: JesusI know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?Once Solomon has done as she bid him he asks her again who she is. True to her word she tells hername and describes the affliction she causes to mothers and children, in the manner of Lamia andLilith. So too she identifies herself as a fierce spirit of a myriad names and many shapes.The claim of Obizuth to have a myriad names and forms is no idle boast. As Abyzou, Abizou,Obizu, Obyzouth and Byzou the spirit makes frequent appearances on ancient amulets and in magicaltexts. Her name relates to the Greek Abyss, which likely has Middle Eastern origins. Renownedscholar A.A. Barb connects her with the Mesopotamian Apsu/Abzu and thence to Tiamat. Her formsare predominantly fish-like or serpentine. She connects with the well known figure of Lilith, also theCoptic Alabasandria and the Byzantine Gylou, whose name also originates in Babylonian culture.Davidson lists numerous names of Lilith, and multiple names occur also with Empusa.A great majority of such female demons derive from concepts of the primordial ocean, and areknown in many cultures. Significantly the Sumerian ocean divided into sweet and salt water forms,and as will be seen a good many fresh water demons are in this class. Greek types are not uncommon;Lamia and Medusa are the classic individual types in whom divine qualities are still pronounced.Water nymphs can often be readily related to the form, as well as more obvious candidates like theGorgons. A not infrequent attribute, as with the Sirens, are the powers of fascination and sexualenticement.Obizuth has a wide array of direct aliases, many such appear on related amulets. One of the rarernames is Antaura (the name means Contrary Wind), who causes migraine headaches. She appears onan amulet in the form of an inscribed rolled silver leaf of the 2nd or 3rd century CE. This is the earliest‘Obizuth amulet’ and was found in Austria at the site of the Roman military settlement of Carnuntum."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"TIn the accompanying historiola Antaura is described as coming from the sea, crying like a deer andmoaning like a cow. She is then confronted by the Ephesian Artemis. It is extremely significant thatArtemis precedes Solomon, Arlaph/Raphael and Saint Sisinnios in this role. The continuity is total,as remarked by Ogden (MWG 260):One [amulet] even preserves the derivative name Abra (pronounced avra) for the demon (inmodern Greek Antaura would be pronounced andavra).He also points out that the historiola is the most distinctive in ancient magical texts.Early Byzantine amulets against Abyzou are numerous. On them she is depicted bound and kneelingwhile beaten by various protective figures. In the Testament this is Afarof, likely a form of Arlaph,which in turn is a coded reference to Raphael. On the Byzantine amulets the angel Arlpah or Solomonhimself is shown beating Abyzou/Obizuth. Many of these amulets are to protect infants and theirmothers from her Lamia-like malice. Her capacity as seductress and strangler is not absent however,and some of these talismans were made for men.Regarding her appearance in the ToS, translator F. C. Conybeare’s comment (Jewish QuarterlyReview, October 1898): Here we seem to have the Greek head of Medusa transformed into ademon, while in the right direction, is not especially informative. Like other appearances of femalespirits in this catalogue, investigation reveals the tip of a veritable iceberg of archaic magical lore.Much more background can be found in the frequently reprinted Evil Eye of Frederick Elworthy, inacademic papers and elsewhere.Such a face makes frequent appearances on Byzantine, Syrian and Palestinian amulets from the 6thcentury; generally adding saints, Solomon or an angel either beating a bound female demon orspearing her from horseback. Earlier prototypes, in which the gorgoneion was the main or onlyfeature, existed from a more ancient period. It is possible that prior to the Byzantine examples therewas an intermediate type, perhaps in a literary source. Russian examples, imitating Byzantine butoften introducing native elements, are known from at least the 10th to 12th century, if not before.There was also interest in them in the Renaissance and later, but that takes us too far from our theme.The origins of the gorgoneion are far, far older and its distribution very wide. There is no majorreason to disagree with Gimbutas in seeing its origins in prehistory, and it is certainly a feature ofarchaic Greek art by the 8th century BCE. It also makes a frequent appearance in Etruscan funerary art.A digression will be necessary to fully appreciate this important amulet and the Lamia who haunts theTestament, the Hygromanteia and later grimoires. Note in the meantime that just such a head appearsamong the magical images of the fixed stars in Arab Hermetic works, associated with Algol.Accordingly Obizuth is identified with a specific decan and its equivalent mansion.The GorgoneionHE GORGONEION has for long ages been reputed one of the most efficacious of amulets (King’s TheGnostics and their Remains); nor is there any reason to doubt the primary identification madeby Lucian: What could be more potent than the face of the Queen of Hell?Its use for a variety of purposes, all protective, are illustrated by an example in King’s text, simplein the extreme, a Gorgon’s head with the legend I protect so-and-so.The history of the symbol in Greek usage dates from the 8th century BCE, becoming common asdevices outside temples in the 6th century. It is perhaps unsurprising that this was particularly thecase in the region around Corinth. After all, Corinth possessed one of the oldest temples of Hera, was"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"the home of Melissa, a haven for Medea and where the Lamia was supposedly bested by Apolloniusof Tyana. It is likely, as Harrison first suggested, that the head originated in a ritual mask; thus thedisembodied head predates the legend of Perseus slaying the Medusa invented to account for it.Homer provides important testimony of the precedence of the head in myth. He mentions the head fourtimes, never in connection with a body, or a decapitation episode.Among the oldest examples are a coin from the Mysian city of Parium and a clay head atMycenaean Tiryns from the 8th century, with a likely monumental example at Knossos in MinoanCrete (15th century BCE). A suggested further prehistory of several thousands of years is more thanlikely. Elworthy is worth consulting regarding its wide distribution; beginning with Greek, Etruscanand Roman examples, thence into Byzantine and medieval European usage. As an amulet it wasapparently popular in Romano-British times, fashioned from jet. Similarly, it was among the mostfrequent devices on Classical coins, and this example was much followed by Anglo-Saxon kings.Similarities have been remarked to the face of Bes; frequently used on Egyptian temples andpalaces, but originating as guardian of the birth tent in predynastic village magic. The earlyimportance in magic of his female counterpart Beset is likely relevant here. Resemblances have alsobeen noted to the face of Kali or Bhavani, as well as certain Tibetan masks, and ritual masks frommany cultures. Whatever these resemblances may indicate in terms of diffusion or archetypes, atraceable history of its use in Western contexts is well documented. A better known or more reputableamulet would be difficult to find; it possessed always an apotropaic power.The connection with Medusa leads to the subject of the beautification of the image in Greek use.Prior to the 5th century BCE the face was always hideous. Wreathed with serpents, her tongue lolledout, tusk like teeth jutted from her mouth, her cheeks were distended and – entirely contrary to Greekartistic convention – her eyes stared directly at the onlooker. While female the face sometimespossessed a beard, likely originally representing streams of blood.Gradually the aesthetic requirements of Greek art refined the original image, until the Medusabecame a beautiful woman, and the gorgoneion followed suit. Refinement is of course entirelyrelative, Etruscan culture never made this change. Among the Greeks, the terror that turned men tostone came to be ascribed to a power projected from her eyes. This is ironic, since the evil eye wasrepelled by this very image. It is also instructive, as the very first literary reference to the evil eye"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"TSconcerned the powers of Medea. This same power led to its frequent use on shields, but also thedoors of kilns, and on mosaics at the doors of houses, guarding the entrance. From Etruscan Italy tothe Black Sea, it recurred constantly as a protective and decorative device in ceramics, metals andtextiles. A connection with a powerful and terrible goddess of remote antiquity need hardly bequestioned.Pterodrakon Winged DragonHIS DRAGON has the limbs and wings of a dragon and breathes fire, but has human face and feet.The wicked sexual implications of the dragon in the polemic are more emphatic with theWinged Dragon. He describes his predilection for anal sex with voluptuous women, a passageso scandalous it is omitted in several manuscripts. So that the ‘error’ of Paganism in worshippingdemons is stressed, the Winged Demon declares that he is worshipped as a god. An intriguing elementof this passage is the revelation that his children become Eros. This may be elucidated in variousways, one of which is a slur on Plato’s Daimon of Love. Eros was an important figure in severalcosmogonies, and his parentage accordingly is given in numerous forms. In the best known form hismother is Aphrodite, as befits the voluptuous form of our dragon’s preferred sexual partners. Sincethe dragon is the father in this story, it is interesting to note that Hermes is often understood to be thefather of Eros. Strikingly the winged Eros is most particularly associated with another version of hisparentage, namely Hermes and Artemis.In other respects similar remarks apply as to the three headed dragon; as a loaded symbol if it is toserve any purpose for us then conscious reinterpretation is required. Thracian iconography, remarkedon in Geosophia, is among the most useful. The negative symbolism, of a figure of evil attacked bymounted Saints (or King Solomon himself) is there entirely absent. The mounted hero of Thrace neverattacks the dragon, for a very simple reason. As the Thracian rider represents the living dynast, theSun in the sky, so the Dragon represents the deified Hero – the Underworld Sun – in chthonic guise.Interestingly, as regards the first of our two dragons, three heads is also important in Thracianiconography.EnepsigosOLOMON NEXT SUMMONS ANOTHER FEMALE SPIRIT named Enepsigos. My reading is closer toConybeare’s than Duling’s; that is, not two heads but two additional heads, and correspondingarms. Enepsigos also speaks of herself as having many names, residing in the Moon andhaving three forms for that reason like the goddess I am called. This cannot be other than HecateTriformis. While both are understood in this period, her hovering near the Moon may imply Hecate asPersephone, rather than simply Selene. In the eschatological schema described by Plutarch and inOrphic sources, Persephone is queen of the Moon as the destination of travelling souls.Her claim to manifest as Kronos to the wise is mysterious. The theurgists famously possessed aninvocation of Kronos; could this have been a manifestation of Hecate, the Moon, as keeper of time?This would make sense in terms of the undercurrent of lunar pantheism detectable both in Theurgy andthe magical papyri. Of particular importance is PGM VII.756–94 where Hecate is the core of acomplete lunar theology, as exalted as any contemporary solar pantheism, wherein she is mistress ofthe whole world and her only superior is the creator IAO.The presence throughout the ToS of Hecate – identified more or less outright with Artemis – hasalready been remarked. As the embodiment of pagan magic of the period her presence is natural,while traces of her in contemporary Jewish magic are also strong. Antipathy to pagan magic"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"MTundoubtedly informed Christian polemic, whether composed for Jewish consumption or aimeddirectly at pagans. Hecate and Apollo are key figures in the influential Chaldean Oracles, the holybook of the Neoplatonist magus. So too their presence in the substrata of theurgic ritual is important tous for the recovery of archaic goetia. In this connection it is worth mentioning again the Ostian amulet,with Solomon on one side and Hecate Triformis on the other, excavated at a Roman crossroadsshrine. This underlines – if such is necessary – that Hecate’s connection with Solomonic magic wasand is as relevant to its practitioners as its opponents.KunopegosANUSCRIPT P has Kunopaston, but Kunopegos is the better reading. Pegasus comes from asimilar root to the latter part of the name, and both mean to spring up, particularly in relationto water. This spirit appears as a cruel sea horse, his foreparts that of a horse, the rear that ofa fish. He is a danger to mariners and the jealous guard of submerged treasures. He can furthermanifest as waves and in human form. Seawater is a necessity of his existence, so that Solomon has tofill the vessel in which he imprisons him with it. The constellation of Pegasus is adjacent to themarine constellation of Pisces; it is prominent among the asterisms of the mansions, as well asrepresented in the Denderah zodiac. Kunopegos may represent a former marine deity, many of whomwhere associated with prophecy, as well as to archaic conceptions of the Underworld.The GiantHE FORM OF THIS UNNAMED SPIRIT is shadowy like Obizuth’s; black representing the invisibility ofghosts in Greek artistic conventions. He bears a sword and identifies himself as a lasciviousspirit of a giant who died in a massacre in the age of giants. The reference is to the Nephelimand the fallen angels who bred with mortal women, as in Enoch and elsewhere in Jewish lore. It issignificant as implying that the Watchers were physical beings, and that after defeat by angelic forcesthey became ghostly. Interestingly he dwells among tombs and impersonates human dead, as otherdemons in the ToS do gods; both alleged deceptions of course demonise pagan belief. It is from suchassertions that the transition from employing the dead in the papyri to demons in the grimoiresderives. While he connects with authentic traditions in Jewish apocalyptic writings the polemicalhand is clearly at work. Thus he answers Solomon’s query regarding the power that defeats him notwith an angel’s name but a reference to the power of the cross.His portrayal as a man with a sword may derive from a Greco-Egyptian decan or star image; to beexplicit, Orion and/or Aldebaran, one of its stars. However in the ToS the spirit is not even dignifiedwith a name. This is not the clearest indication in the text that spirits outside chapter 18 alsocorrespond with decan entities, although following them provides a stronger case. Now however it istime to examine the oldest and most relevant portion of the text that deals with them explicitly."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"TTHE SPIRITS OF THE TESTAMENT OF SOLOMONIIThe DecansHE OLDEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL portion of the Testament deserves both full quotation and adedicated chapter.

It is to be noted thatoriginally the demons introduced themselves thus: I O Lord King Solomon am N, not I am KingN (RTS). The word elements in the preamble translates stoicheia, a technical term whosemeaning underwent great transformations over time. Earlier in the ToS it was used to describe theseven female spirits; whether these correspond to the Pleiades or the planets an astrological contextfor the term remains. Stoicheia is also used by Saint Paul (Galatians 4:3), probably in an astrologicalsense. Such passages demonstrate awareness – and disapproval – of the proximity of contemporaryreligions to magic. This characteristic awareness is also shown in Ephesians 6 where an implicitreference to the decans is not unlikely:11: Put on the complete armour of God; that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.12: For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against Principalities and Powers [viz,angelic Orders], against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against the spirits of wickednessin the high places [viz, the air].1 The name of the spirit is derived from Rex, being transliterated into Greek letters. The first of thedecans is their chief, and Rex is a close equivalent of Baal. As a decan of Aries the physicalcorrespondence to the head matches our contemporary astrological ideas. Michael too is a naturalcorrespondence here. The thwarting angel paradigm is clearly in place, but – in terms of underlyingideas and influences – angel and demon are really more equivalent than opposite.4 This spirit is missing from MS P, and thus from Conybeare’s text. The name may derive from Horus,as seemingly does one of the demons of the Goetia of Solomon. More importantly, Horus underwentsyncretism with Apollo in late antiquity.5 MS P gives the name of the fifth spirit as Iudal, and the formula as Uruel Iudal.8 MS P gives the angel’s name as Arael.10 Gundel suggests this spirit’s name derives from a title of Apollo.11 Here plainly the magician employs a spell or formula rather than the invocation of a specificangel. The correspondence of laurel with our Apollo is significant.12 Again a formula or spell is employed rather than the thwarting paradigm. The importance ofSabaoth, who is often associated with vowel combinations, should be apparent. MS P gives the nameof the spirit as Saphathorael, the affliction is still discord among men. The formula is given as thesenames of angels: Iaeo, Iealo, Iolet, Sabaoth, Ithoth, Bae, these to be worn at neck or ear when thedrunken fit will dissipate. The last two names appear to be Egyptian, here combined with vowelcombinations and with Sabaoth (the Lord of Time, of whom the Sun is the visible face).13 MS P has: I am called Bobel [sic], and I cause nervous illness by my assaults. If I hear the nameof the great ‘Adonael, constrain Bothothel,’ I at once retreat."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"14 MS P has Kumeatel/Kumentael with shivering fits and torpor. There appears to be confusionbetween 14 and 15 in the MSS. In MS P the mysterious Iax occurs in the next verse rather than this,while the formula here is Zoroel, imprison Kumentael.15 MS P has the spirit’s name as Roeled and the same affliction and formula as 14 above. Iax wasmentioned earlier in the ToS in connection with the Headless Demon.16 MS P has Atrax, otherwise similar. Dan has been interpreted as Zeus, but this may be subject toerror.17 MS P has the spirit’s name as Ieropael and the formula as Iudarize, Sabune, Denoe. The Greekterms used and the descriptions suggest epilepsy; a disease called sacred by the ancients andassociated with Hercules.18 A written formula is employed, protecting the door, rather than the invocation of a named angel.The eight patriarchs, according to Gundel, represent the primal Ogdoad of the Egyptians, but thesavant can be over zealous with Egyptian associations. Jewish practice is apparent in MS P, where thespirit concerned is named Buldumech: If anyone write down the names of thy sires, Solomon, onpaper and place it in the antechamber of his house, I retreat thence. And the legend written shallbe as follows: ‘The God of Abram, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob commands thee –retire from this house in peace.’ And I at once retire.19 Mardero is the twentieth spirit in MS P and the formula Sphener, Rafael, retire, drag me notabout, flay me not is written on the leaf of a book and tied around the victim’s neck. Here the mannerof writing the spirit’s own name, rather than an angelic opponent, is the missing key. Some instructionmay have been omitted or lost, for example a diminishing name formula or ‘wing.’The nineteenth spirit in MS P is first called Naoth but the name Nathath is used in the formula. Theytake their seat upon men’s knees, but the neck is mentioned in the formula. This suggests a femalespirit who strangles males succumbing to her wiles. The formula Phnunoboeol, depart Nathath andtouch thou not the neck is written on paper, which causes the spirit to flee. The current text has ashorter form of this instruction.20 See above remarks, as with several examples following, employment of a written name in thisway represents another magical methodology at work. This spirit and the remainder of the listfollowing have the title Rhyx, transliterated from Rex. Originally this was part of an address toSolomon: O King Solomon, I am Nathotho and so on. This was suppressed as giving too muchhonour to the king in subsequent polemical Christian redactions. In the case of this spirit the gendermay not be male.21 MS P agrees regarding the spirit’s name bar the spurious title, the affliction too is the same.However, it gives a variant formula: write on paper Rorex, do thou pursue Alath and fasten aroundhis neck.22 MS P has an apparent lacuna at the twenty second spirit. However its 23rd is quite different fromthe above and that following:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The twenty-third said: I am called Nefthada. I cause the reins to ache, and I bring aboutdysury. If any one write on a plate of tin the words: ‘Iathoth, Uruel, Nephthada’ and fasten itround the loins, I at once retreat.24 Mar can mean lord (or saint), and the name could thus mean Lord of Lords of the Air, which ismeaningful in the context of such spirits. MS P has Akton rather than Aktonme, the material written onis copper from a shipwreck.25 MS P has Arara, Charara for its formula. Duling points out that Arara appears in PGM 19a.48.Gundel’s painstaking work on the decans lists an Aroi Aroi among the decan gods.26 MS P has I am called Enenuth, and gives a variant formula: write Allazool, pursue Enenuth andtie it around the victim.27 Greenfield is of the opinion that Axesbuth is derived from Ozibuth, similarly Gundel discernsbythos, depth, in the suffix. This again underlines that the Rhyx prefix is no guide to gender, let alonerank. The formula is obviously much abbreviated. MS P gives the spirit’s name as Pheth, the sameaffliction and a more complete formula: If one exorcise me in wine, sweet-smelling and unmixed bythe eleventh aeon, and say: ‘I exorcise thee by the eleventh aeon to stop, I demand, Pheth(Axiopheth),’ then give the patient to drink, I at once retreat.28 MS P has Harpax and runs the two words of power together.29 The word hysteria derives from the Latin for womb, which was subject to odd beliefs fromancient times onward; being believed to wander in the body. From this arose problems which magicalmedicine sought to address.33 The wing shape typical of the papyri is clearer in MS P:L E I K O U R G O SE I K O U R G O SK O U R G O SO U R G O SU R G O SR G O SG O SO SSThe name Leikourgos shows plain Greek influence, and the reference is to one of two persons.

Immediatelyafter the decan section follows the latter part of the Testament consisting of chapters 19 to 26,where his dignity and power are consciously undermined rather than emphasised. Klutz may beconsulted in matters of textual analysis here, should the reader wish to pursue the matter. He points tostructural connections between these later chapters and the sequence of events in I Kings 10, hence theodd sandwiching of the incident with the elderly artisan between two passages involving Sheba.The manuscripts of the Testament vary a good deal at this point (chapter 19), adding andsubtracting matter. Duling’s text gives one of the simpler and most significant readings, while dealingwith the others in the notes. When the kings of the earth come to Solomon bringing metals and woodfor the Temple:Among them Sheba, Queen of the South, who was a witch (goes), came with much arrogance andbowed before me.Later pro-Solomonic MSS of the ToS term her the wise sibyl, marking a line of descent for her as aQueen of spirits in the grimoires.Chapter 20 is completely given over to the reappearance of Ornias in the story and the incident ofthe old artisan and his son. Klutz enlarges on how these events do not show Solomon in a good light.Chapter 21 reintroduces Sheba, and involves Solomon taking the witch queen into the Holy ofHolies, with a similar disapproving subtext.Chapter 22 brings a letter from Adarkes, King of Arabia, petitioning the great Solomon forassistance. This is the cue for the two demons whose coming was foretold in Solomon’s interviewswith Beelzeboul. These differ from all others in the Testament, in that they come on cue, not whenSolomon calls, and they may not be bound by him. The first is the wind demon Ephippas whoSolomon despatches a brave young servant to capture in a leather bottle. This spirit is well analysedby Klutz as a literary construct. His name means on horseback and the intention of the passage is toundermine Solomon’s status, since he was commonly portrayed in heroic demon hunting guise ridinga horse like a victorious Roman emperor. The other is described as a spirit dwelling in the Red Sea,and is a compatriot of Ephippas. The name of the spirit is Abezethibou, which appears to be acorruption of Obizuth. The latter is a far clearer cut and important figure, what is not clear is a realconnection of Abezethibou with her in the polemicist’s mind.Inarguably, the intention in this part of the text to defame Solomon is the main force at work.Abezethibou confesses to having assisted Jannes and Jambres; magicians of the Pharaoh who opposedMoses. Thus, when Abezethibou and Ephippas undertake a task for Solomon’s glorification, thereader has been prepared to compare it with this ungodly magic. Thus prepared, the end of theTestament concerns Solomon’s fall into idolatry, the result of magic’s sapping his moral fibre.128: And I Solomon glorified God, and adorned the Temple of the Lord with all fair-seeming.And I was glad in spirit in my kingdom, and there was peace in my days. And I took wives of myown from every land, who were numberless. And I marched against the Jebusaeans, and there Isaw a Jebusaean, daughter of a man: and fell violently in love with her, and desired to take her towife along with my other wives. And I said to their priests: Give me the Shunammite to wife. But"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Sthe priests of Moloch said to me: If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship our gods, thegreat god Raphan and the god called Moloch. I therefore was in fear of the glory of God, anddid not follow to worship. And I said to them: I will not worship a strange god. What is thisproposal, that ye compel me to do so much? But they said: ... by our fathers.As is next seen, Solomon’s fall comes about through sex and pagan gods. Incidentally Raphan is thegod Rephan who appears in the decan table of Firmicus, 1st Pisces; also known as Remphan.129: And when I answered that I would on no account worship strange gods, they told the maidennot to sleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to the gods. I then was moved, but crafty Erosbrought and laid by her for me five grasshoppers, saying: Take these grasshoppers, and crushthem together in the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you. And this I actuallydid. And at once the Spirit of God departed from me, and I became weak as well as foolish in mywords. And after that I was obliged by her to build a temple of idols to Baal, and to Raphan, andto Moloch, and to the other idols.Eros appears several times in the ToS; there are other subtexts, but sex and paganism is sufficientlyclear. Solomon’s wisdom departs him through his honouring strange gods.130: I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God quite departed from me;and my spirit was darkened, and I became the sport of idols and demons. Wherefore I wrote outthis Testament, that ye who get possession of it may pity, and attend to the last things, and not tothe first. So that ye may find grace for ever and ever. Amen.Klutz discounts the usual eschatological sense of the last things in favour of a reference to thesequence of events in the text. Here I must differ. Agreement with spirits, in theurgy, safeguarded thesoul; that magic has the opposite effect is exactly what Christian polemic has ever asserted. Thisaside, the diminution of Solomon is sufficiently demonstrated as the intention of the redactor, whileour intention is to clarify the spirit catalogue.THE END OF THE SPIRIT CATALOGUEO FAR AS the spirit catalogue is concerned, my readers are confronted by a peculiar situation.Ornias reappears to usher in the closing passages and between him and two immenselypowerful demons comes Sheba. Her place in the spirit catalogue is certain, and will bedeveloped upon. Then there are Ephippas and Abezithibou who so far appear to be best understoodas literary constructs, rather than pre-existent figures in cult or magic. By this reading their chiefimportance would be restricted to subtexts of the Testament in polemical redactions, rather than spirithierarchies of the Solomonic genre.However, as regards magical tradition there is plainly more to these two spirits. Firstly thispassage parallels the Confession of Saint Cyprian 24, where his instructor the devil calls Cyprianthe new Jambres, the rival of Moses who in the ToS Abezithibou confesses assisting. Secondly, aswas seen earlier, the beginning of the Testament introduces four spirits, Ornias, Beelzeboul,Onoskelis and Asmo-deus; Beelzeboul then reappears, dividing this group from the main catalogue.Something very similar is at work here, give or take the two appearances of Sheba previously"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"explained.

That is, theHygromanteia, translated and edited by Ioannis Marathakis; whose former study of invisibilityspells was so penetrating. As regards the title Hygromanteia there has been some controversy.Some have doubted the connection of the text with the subject of water divination; academicsTorijano and Greenfield have both supported the connection. Noted occult writers Skinner andRankine have proposed another explanation for its use; a connection with the vessels into whichSolomon conjured spirits. My sympathies are entirely with the academics. With them I consider it awholly correct title, linking Solomonic magic with vessel divination as known from the papyri.Greenfield’s thesis (in Traditions of Belief in Late Byzantine Demonology) resembles my own, viz:The obvious similarities between the main rite of the circle and the other hydromancies andkatoptromancies which also appear here ... suggest that it is the basin or mirror that has droppedout of the main ritual rather than the other rituals being appended to something that originally hadnothing to do with them. At some time prior to the fifteenth century then, if this is the case, therewill have been in existence a ... [Solomonic] hydromancy text-book. This will have had at itsheart a ritual for summoning demons to a circle by means of a water-basin or something similar,but it will also have included alongside this instructions and detailed information required for thecomplex preparations which preceded the summoning, involving the use of powers and conceptsdrawn from magical and catarchic astrology.In this respect the publication adds weight to the thesis regarding the Art Armadel outlined in my TrueGrimoire. As Greenfield observes shortly after the quoted remarks, some materials of theHygromanteia are very similar to the much older papyri. So too by comparison with theHygromanteia the antiquity of many core features of the Grimorium Verum is established; removingthe stigma of romantic invention that has too long attached to it.One revelation a careful reader will note in the pages of the Hygromanteia is the conjuration of theLady of the Mountains; or Kalē of the Mountains. What appears to be a comparable figure inshamanic lore is discussed in Clive Tolley’s Shamanism; the holy mountain maiden performs animportant role in initiation, supplying the shaman with water during his struggle with his future spirithelpers. Incidentally, the modern tendency to banish spirit visitors without further ado has probablyled to many cases of failure to become a shaman!Returning to Kalē, among her other names are Sympilia and Sibylia, in which guise she appears inScot, and a related spell in the GV. Descended directly from the Sibyl (Sibylla) she is an importantbut hitherto overlooked or neglected figure in the grimoire tradition, as the Hygromanteia amongother documents makes plain. While described in the polemics as a goes, Sheba is called the wisesibyl in later pro-Solomonic MSS of the ToS. In Abramelin, which Mathers handles rather better thanDehn, an oblique reference to Sibyls suggests the pseudonymous author knew more.Turning first to Sibylia’s role in the Hygromanteia, there are several points of interest to highlight,some of which require comparison with themes explored in our former volume. Sibylia in theHygromanteia is referred to as Kalē, a well defined figure of Greek folklore, also called Lamia. Hername Kalē can be interpreted simply as beautiful, or in a more nuanced way as the kindly one; eithersense being partly euphemistic and certainly no general guide to her nature. She is often depicted asinhumanly beautiful but having the legs of a goat or an ass like Onoskelis. In the Hygromanteia on the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"other hand she has a serpentine lower body, though human legs, rosy cheeks, well defined breasts andlong blonde hair. Importantly, as well as coloured garments she wears a crown. Her name of Lamiareminds us of the Libyan sibyl discussed in Geosophia. The term lamiæ refers also to a type of spirit;a circumstance often encountered in relation to the beings and rulers discussed in this volume. Therituals in which she figures in the Hygromanteia are both worth close examination.One such ritual (MTS 131) requires the operator to go to the mountains. Upon a rock serving as atable an offering is laid involving finely coloured pieces of silk cloth, with a bowl of honey and pinekernels, along with a slip of parchment bearing magical words. This offering is timed for noon on the1st August. The magician then hides, awaiting the imminent appearance of the Lady of the Mountains.She will ask out loud who did this good thing for her. The magician is to respond then, and ask forsuch and such a thing. The Lady will bid him to leave and grant his wish.The date of this rite is significant of course, corresponding to one of the major Sabbats in witchlore. Both mountains and pine trees are connected with Cybele, although provisionally we should notbe over eager to make this connection. (The initial of Cybele should really be a k or hard c,etymological connection with the Sibyl while often assumed is not necessarily a given).An example of a wish the Lady will grant follows in the text. It is, in my opinion, quite clear fromthe phrase such and such a thing that this is an example rather than the sole permissible object of therite. Nevertheless the example is extremely significant. The silken cloths used in the rite are now hungfrom the neck of your horse, parchment talismans are attached to each leg, bearing the legends: windslayer, high-flying eagle, victory and power. The horse will then run – likely originally fly – like aneagle. Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek myth, is the child of Medusa, a circumstance that isunlikely to be coincidence. A winged horse for a magician is powerfully suggestive of shamanicjourneys. There are also traditions where the Lady gives a magical handkerchief or belt to themagician, enabling them to call upon her at will. This theme doubtless connects with the ringbestowed by her in grimoire rituals. The handkerchief and the cloths hung from the horse aretantalisingly similar results of invoking her.A more extensive rite of hers in the Hygromanteia is a mirror divination process (128) for finding athief, knowledge of treasure locations etc. This ritual is a form of the Art Armadel process discussedin True Grimoire. It also bears significant points of resemblance with the Sibylia rite in Scot, and thedifferences in the earlier text are enlightening. The ritual includes the preliminary summoning of anintermediary. He is responsible for laying a table, and arranging and cooking a feast for Sybilia andher companions. All these events are witnessed in the mirror and the stages of the rite closelyresemble those given by Griffiths in his seminal Fragment of a Græco-Egyptian work upon Magic.The continuity from the papyri to the Hygromanteia to Lane’s eye witness account of magic in 19thcentury Egypt is patent (Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians).Like many such rites this involves a boy seer. In addition the magician requires a mirror and theknife of art. With the knife a Circle is drawn (the description is significant: like a grave on theground). Much like the circle I refer to in TG it is surrounded with pentagrams. When complete theknife is thrust in the middle, a gesture typical of Greek folk magic, while the black hilted knife is wellknown on Crete. The mirror is then held over the knife during the conjurations that follow.Sympilia is invoked that a cook may come who appears as a lame horseman, his servant is sent forlambs from the highest mountain. The Cook is bid cook them and Sympilia and her court are invited.The Cook arranges tables, seats, cloths and so forth, all gold and silver. So too bread and wine aremade ready. They then come and take their seats and rejoice before the magician gets down to"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"business. In the papyri and in Lane’s account this rejoicing would be the spirits enjoying their feasttogether, before the magician speaks to one of them separately. The Hygromanteia may haveoriginally taken this form, but as it now stands the feast is delayed a while longer. Sympilia is askedto send her servant to Solomon at Lakedaimonia:... in order to give him the talisman that is nailed by steel and sealed by the trigram.Upon this talisman when it is fetched the company is sworn to answer truthfully to the magician’squestions. They are then addressed regarding the question in hand. After this:When the boy rises, you must take the mirror, and recite: Go eat, drink, and come back wheneverI invoke you again.Then, take the knife and clean the spot where the pentagrams are drawn. You can repeat it atanother time, if you want.A major difference between this and the later English Sibylia rite, is the lame demon as it wereappearing in the role of the deceased spirit employed in Scot. This lame demon appears in Greekfolklore as the Sibylia’s son. In that context he can also be the king of goblin-like demons(kalikantzaroi). Alternatively he can be outright identified with the devil. Despite his lameness he isvery fast. The likely equivalence of Ornias and Asmodeus has been mentioned. So too the lattershares the status of king of demons with Belzebuth. In this light another passage from the Testamenttakes on additional meaning:I then asked of the demon if there were females among them. And when he told me that therewere, I said that I desired to see them. So Beelzeboul went off at high speed, and brought untome Onoskelis ...We have here a fast moving and high ranking demon fetching a female demon. Given the paucity ofmaterial regarding Beelzeboul in earlier Jewish lore, this part of the story probably originated withOrnias/Asmodeus. Similarly Onoskelis and the Sybil appear to be closely associated. Therelationship of a lame demon with an important Lamia figure has definite connotations of which manyreaders will be aware. In short, we are reminded of the familial relations of Asmodeus with Lilith,among other similar combinations. Moreover Kalē is the obvious syncretic source for one of thenames of Lilith recounted in various sources (see Gustav Davidson, appendix 351–352)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"There are other aspects of the above ritual that require elucidation. Lakedaimonia – another name ofSparta – is a strange destination. As Marathakis notes, it has no relation to Solomon, and the authormay have imagined it had a connection with daimones. On the other hand a talismanic objectassociated with the proto-Sibyl Cassandra was made in Sparta (See Geosophia: ‘Sibyllinia’). Thiswas the Palladium, fashioned in Lakedaimonia by Abaris from the bones of Pelops. As discussedpreviously this powerful talisman is a predecessor of such potent objects as the Seal of Solomon.Identification with another potent talisman associated with the Sibyl follows from the fact that thetalisman is nailed up by Solomon. This mirrors another reference half-hidden in the Testamentregarding Solomon and the Head of the Gorgon:And I Solomon having heard this, and having glorified the Lord, ordered her hair to be bound, andthat she should be hung up in front of the Temple of God ...As Greenfield notes, the Sibyl was similarly suspended – in a jar or cage – at the temple of Apollo atCumæ. Another location he mentions is the temple of Herakles at Argyrus; this was in Sicily, wherethe gorgoneion was a frequent motif. Rather than view his suggestion as an alternative, it is importantto read it as parallel. Virgil’s sibyl after all was a guide to the Underworld, and who better?"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The linkage of Lamia with the Libyan sibyl is more than an isolated connection. As was seen inGeosophia the Sibyl legends of Norcia connected her with Sheba of the Solomonic legend. In themanuscripts of the Testament – often merged with the Hygromanteia – Sheba is usually called agoes, translated as witch in a derogatory sense. A more positive variant tradition is found in MS D(Dionysus Monastery, Mt. Athos, 16th century) where instead she is termed the wise Sibyl (SibyllaSaba); likewise manuscript No. 2011 Bibliothèque Nationale terms her Sibylla. Italian witch lore isreplete with references to the wise sibyl and Sibyllia; as has been shown, this was a widespreadmotif in European magic. A very similar motif can be found in Sicilian fairy lore, where she is queenof these spirits. Sicily was anciently strongly connected with the cult of Persephone, and as seenabove connects also with the gorgoneion and classical Sibyl lore. Incidentally the title of Sheba inscripture and the Testament of Solomon alike is the Queen of the South; in folklore Solomon mistookher for Lilith on account of her legs, and Lilith is frequently associated with the South wind. SimilarlyJewish demonology allots a special place to the Queen of Sheba. She was considered one of thequeens of the demons and is sometimes identified with Lilith – for the first time in the Targum (Job1), and later in the Zohar and the subsequent literature.In short, while it may appear odd to include Sheba in the spirit catalogue, when considered as aname of Sibylia this is far from being the case. Traditions surrounding them and their common identityare numerous and could be recounted ad nauseam; in essence however the matter reduces to this:Sibylia is a Queen of spirits, connected with Sheba, Lamia and Lilith. At very least from the 4thcentury CE her role in folklore and literary tradition is extensive and continuous; there need be nohesitation in pronouncing her first among the Queens of the grimoires."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"TTHE SIBYL OF THYATIRATo the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyesare like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. I know your deeds, your loveand faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did atfirst. Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herselfa prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eatingof food sacrificed to idols.Revelation 2:18–20HE CITY OF THYATIRA was founded by migrants from Lydia, under whom it first bore the namePelopia. Seleucus I, the founder of the Seleucid dynasty, greatly extended it and added to itspopulation towards the end of his reign. While its own trade was significant, the real importanceof the city consisted largely of a strategic position on a major military and trade route. The city wasnot of major importance in itself, but served a significant strategic role for various empires in theregion, from Seleucus to the Romans. Thyatira was also remarkable for possessing more trade-guildsthan any other city in the Roman province of Asia. As well as dyers, leather-workers, tanners, pottersand others, there was a guild of bronzesmiths. Hephæstus appears on a coin of the city complete withanvil, tongs and hammer, preparing a helmet for Athena who awaits his finishing touches. As a majordeity of the region his presence here reflects more than the local requirements for military equipment.The chief deity of Thyatira was the hero and Lydian sun-god Tyrimnaios who was identified withHelios and Apollo. He bore the name Helios Tyrimnaios Pythios Apollo and the titles Propolis andPropator. In the Roman period this worship became linked to the emperor worship cult. Such a figurewas common in Lydian and Phrygian cities in the region. There are aspects to his cult in Thyatira thatassume importance given the role of the sun-god in Roman religion under Syrian influence. Forexample, the Emperor Elagabalus, himself descended from a line of Syrian priests, appears on a coinof the city. He is portrayed with his hand in that of Apollo Tyrimnaios. The Emperor and god stand oneither side of a flaming altar.Another deity of the city was Artemis Boreitene, a form of Apollo’s sister linked to EphesianArtemis and the Persian dæva Anahita (Anaitis to the Romans). Whether connected with this deity ornot, Thyatira also revered another important female figure: Sambethe, the Sibyl. Sambethe isvariously known as the Chaldean, or Hebrew, or Persian Sibyl, and her cult flourished in theChaldean’s precinct. A strong tradition of Jewish influence pervades its memory, as well as theseindications of mixed oriental influence that are undoubtedly important. The sanctuary arose from orwas the apparent site of a fusion of Jewish and Pagan conceptions. The oracular nature of Sybillinetradition was a principal element of this syncretism.It is without any doubt Sambethe – or a woman prominent in her cult – that is referred to sodisparagingly in Revelation. Incidentally, the message to the angel of Thyatira is by far the longest toany of the Seven Churches. Seleucus the first had a policy of settling Jews in his cities, although it isnot known for sure whether this was the case in Thyatira. Acts 16:14 provides circumstantialevidence that there was such a community. Paul and his companions met a gentile woman fromThyatira in Macedonia; Lydia of Thyatira is described as god-fearing which term indicates a gentilewith sympathies toward Jewish religion. It is curious that her name is the same as that of the city fromwhich the founders of Thyatira came; an ancient seat of the worship of Apollo, associated with"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"prophetesses.The eminent Professor of Semitic studies, Emil Schürer, suggested the Sambethe precinct came intobeing through a Jewish community. A community in which Jews and gentiles exchanged ideas maywell have been associated with it. An alternative suggestion among some modern Christian exegetes,that Jezebel merely encouraged the Christian community to be accommodating to the pagan trade-guilds, does not address her role as prophetess. Schürer on the other hand held resolutely that thisJezebel was the priestess of the Chaldean Sibyl."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"TASMODEUSDo you think, Sir, said I, that these noblemen prefer to trace their origin to the Sylphs?... Is it not more glorious for these illustrious men to be descended from beings so perfect,wise and powerful than from some foul hobgoblin or infamous Asmodeus?Comte de Gabalis, Discourse IVHE REHABILITATION OF ASMODEUS being, apparently, beyond so great a savant as the Comte, it wouldbe unreasonable of me to attempt it. Was he not a demon before he entered Jewish lore fromPersia, let alone the Christian grimoires? Nevertheless, common assumptions concerning him,and his identity with other figures of Jewish and Persian lore, are under informed. In any case beingknown as ‘reasonable’ is something I can live without.According to the common theory, Asmodeus originates in a figure of Zoroastrian religion: Æshma,the messenger of Ahriman; a demon (dæva) of wrath whose attribute is a bloodied mace. Affinitiescertainly exist between Æshma and Asmodeus, although linguistically there appear to be no groundsfor deriving Asmodeus from Æshma Dæva as is often claimed. One of several problems with doingso is that the construction Æshma Dæva is unknown in Persian writings.In Christian lore Asmodeus obtained his clearest definition from the pre-Christian Book of Tobit;likely written in the 2nd century BCE though set six centuries earlier and once thought to date from thattime. Therein Asmodeus is responsible for slaying seven bridegrooms of Sarah before he is finallydefeated by the angel Raphael and a ritual involving the burning of the heart and liver of a fish. Thisexplains the formula given against him in the Testament of Solomon, which in its original form datesfrom the 1st century CE. Interestingly he is portrayed as fleeing – or being banished – into Egypt; hisbinding by Raphael perhaps being limited to preventing his return. This is reminiscent of the flight ofthe Olympians from Typhon, and may reflect an identification of Egyptian deities with demons. Thatthe Egyptians also considered foreign places as the realm of the demonic is an ironic rider. Theassociation of both Set-Typhon and Asmodeus with the constellation Ursa Major draws such themestogether. Other affinities will emerge as we go on.The Tobit story may follow a common pattern in Judaic religious literature in which older gods andheroes are recast as humans, historicising older myth. Certainly Sarah’s father, Raguel, shares hisname with an angel, and the number of her slain husbands may point to an older pagan myth involvingseven gods.So too mention must be made of the fact that in Zoroastrian lore the Dævas are evil, opposing thegood Ahuras, while in Hinduism the Asuras are evil, opposing the good Devas. The true origins of thedichotomy in Indo-European language involve ancient religious reforms and transformations, whoseprecise nature may never be known. Nevertheless the Persian Dævas appear to have a prehistory asnational gods; a cult abolished or opposed by Zoroaster. Not, as has been said elsewhere, entirelysuccessfully – particularly in the one time provinces of the Persian Empire such as Asia Minor. At thesame time, as mentioned, some dævas continued to receive cult long after the reforms of Zoroaster,not least in the region of Anatolia, an area of pivotal importance for Goetia. Major deities such as thegoddess Anahita are in fact dævas. Æshma has been termed a storm demon in studies of Zoroastrianlore, and this could point to an original form akin to primitive forms of Zeus and regional Baals.An intriguing parallel to the story in Tobit resides in Kimbanda; the description of Pomba Gira aswoman of seven husbands. Tobit’s account may well involve an inversion of a rival cult’s"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"mythology; perhaps with the husbands being planetary suitors as in the myths of Sophia. Alsorelevant are the seven demons cast out of Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2). These seven spirits receive noclear identification, which together with the centuries old distortion of Magdalene’s role suggestslayers of mystery. The famous dance of the seven veils has been interpreted as a Gnostic rite ofliberation from fatalistic planetary demons. This would identify the spirits with the planetary vices(which Frisvold identifies with the kiumbas in a Brazilian context); such underlying themes couldmake Asmodeus the hero of the story in an older form.This aside, perhaps greater clarity regarding Asmodeus still lurks in the context of Judeo-Christiandemonology. There are a good many points that require highlighting and clarification before anyreappraisal of him – particularly in relation to other figures – can be consistent and meaningful.Firstly, as in any mythological study, it is important to consider his parentage.In the Testament of Solomon he claims: I was born of angel’s seed by a daughter of man.According to Nahmanides and others of later date, this refers to his siring by an angel namedShamdon upon Naamah, sister of Tubal Cain. However Shamdon appears to be a duplication ofAshmedai (both names derive from the same root, ShMD, the differences being regional).Nevertheless, such a parentage would make him equivalent to a Giant (Nephelim) in Hebrew lore,and a demigod or hero in Greek; to be specific, intermediate in nature between humans and higherspecies. There are different versions of his birth in Rabbinical lore: according to some accounts hewas the offspring of Adam’s laying with Lilith. According to others his father was either Adam orTubal Cain, and his mother the sister of Tubal Cain, Naamah. Tubal Cain is the likely Semitic root ofthe name Vulcan, probably representing the same kind of duplication as with Shamdon. Such recurrentduplication suggests they are the same myth, involving dual forms of the same figure.Naamah herself is ambivalent in nature. As sister of Tubal Cain she is a daughter of man, but asNahema she also appears as a demoness who resembles Lilith in all respects. There is a tradition offour queens of devils in which both figure; in this tradition Lilith is foremost of the four. According toHayyim Vital (the successor of the great kabbalist Isaac Luria; 1543–1620) four queens of the demonsrule over Rome (Lilith), over Salamanca (Agrath), over Egypt (Rahab), and over Damascus(Naamah). Given the connection of Lilith with the South wind these correspondences should beconsidered nominal and suggestive only. Note however the highly significant similarity of Lilith asfirst of four queens to that of Oriens as head of the Four Kings. The groups of Kings and Queens arefurther linked by the presence of Asmodeus in their myths. A popular tradition of German Jews whichlikely connects with Vital’s Four Queens credits them with rulership over the four seasons. At the turnof each season their menstrual blood poisons the waters, and it is therefore prohibited to drink waterat the change of the seasons. The essentials appear below:QUEENDIRECTIONCITY (SIC)CITIES AS CULTURAL REFERENCESLilithNorthRomeHecateMahalatSouthEgyptAlabasandriaNaamahEastDamascusLilith &cAgrat (aka Igrat)WestSalamancaMaria PadilhaAccording to some kabbalistic traditions the mother of Asmodeus was another succubus or Lamiafigure, Agrat Bat Malat. This tradition makes his father King David. Taking Lilith and Naamah asnear equivalents, the fathers being human in each case, all these accounts converge in meaning."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"AAsmodeus by these traditions springs from a mortal copulating with a demoness. In essence then,whatever version we follow, his nature – and sphere of influence – are determined by his parentage.All clearly place him lower in the chain of being than such figures as Lucifer, Belzebuth and Astaroth,whose nature involves no mortal admixture. He is nevertheless foremost among those demons sprungfrom such couplings and wields great dominion upon the earth.That a lamia, under whichever name, is his mother (as well as sister and bride) is highly informative.In loose usage the children of Lilith are lilim (Hebrew) or lamiæ (Greek), female demons of likenature to herself. Hecate has the same role of mother or chief of the lamiæ in Greco-Roman religion.Essentially a lamia can be either a demoness or a spirit of the dead of either gender. So too inHebrew, Lilith is the mother of she-demons and also demons in general, male and female. Thesefigures in both Greek and Hebrew lore frequently shift between demons and dangerous ghosts, in factsuch distinctions between these as appear in later cultures are largely artificial.AshmedaiGREAT PROBLEM in the common theories regarding Asmodeus is that the talmudic Ashmedai isnotably less demonic. While they are frequently equated their identification with one another isproblematic and disputed. Ashmedai resembles a friendly satyr or in more colloquial terms, aRobin Goodfellow; though possessing awesome power and penetrating insight. He is fairly wellintentioned, highly intelligent and jocular; also capable of acts of kindness.In haggadic lore indeed Ashmedai, far from being a permanent resident in Hell, has no connectionwith it at all. On the contrary, he ascends from his mountain retreat to heaven each day to participatein learned theological discussions before returning to Earth to eavesdrop on their earthly equivalents.When Solomon sends men to trap him by making him drunk, he at first refuses to drink, mindful ofreligious prohibitions against drunkenness. When, overcome by thirst, he falls into their clutches he isbrought to Solomon. Imprisoned and set to work, he eventually tricks Solomon in return. Solomonwonders wherein the power of demons resides, since their king can be held prisoner by a man.Ashmedai asks Solomon to remove his magical ring in order for him to explain. He then revealshimself in his true form; when he dips his body to one side one wingtip touches the earth, the otherheaven. Such vastness is of course convergent with that accredited to Typhon. Next he picks Solomonup and hurls him four hundred parasangs distance from Jerusalem, assumes his form and rules in hisplace, including access to his wives. Given the arrogance and cruelty modern sentiment readilyperceives in Solomon’s treatment of this rough but pleasant demon, we cannot but sympathise with hisrevenge.On Solomon’s return the deception is eventually uncovered, though Solomon has difficulty provinghis identity. It transpires that the demon disregarded religious law in his relations with Solomon’swives, and also never appeared without his slippers on (to conceal his feet, those of a rooster).Armed with a second or recovered ring of power Solomon confronts his rival, who takes flight. Wemay be forgiven for taking pleasure in the fact Solomon is unable to once more fetter his guest.All this is very well, say proponents of the identity of Ashmedai with Asmodeus. However theHaggadah are late, many features of the story are not truly connected with the demon but only thehumbling of the sinful King. The haggadic tradition is influenced too by the Testament of Solomon.The wings of Ornias may have supplied those of Ashmedai, and other elements of the story"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"undoubtedly originate there. In other words detailed though it is, the haggadic tradition tells us nothingof the original nature of Ashmedai and does not disprove his origin in the Persian fiend. This disputehowever is not ours, the ‘Persian fiend’ being less interesting than – say – a pre-Zoroastrian dævareceiving cult in the mountains of Asia Minor throughout the period!So, never mind where he got the wings from, what about those feet? The rooster’s feet are presentthroughout Jewish lore, while the Goetia of Solomon tells us he has the feet of a goose. Interestingly,the goose is a bird of Aphrodite, with whom Asmodeus (as will be shown) shares a correspondencewith Taurus. The Key mentions a goose quill pen (KoS II.xiv) without provisos; the Book of SaintCyprian however stipulates it is used in the signing of pacts, and indeed prefers it for all purposes.This is interesting, as the KoS reference also places the goose pen first, with the instructions for pen,ink and colours. It mentions additional pens – from swallow and crow – in the following chapter, thusceding priority to the goose pen. I have discussed elsewhere that the primary purpose of parchmentand writing in the Solomonic grimoires involves the pact.What is important overall however is that, one way or other, the feet of Asmodeus are somehowabnormal. There are a variety of mythological variations, one human foot, one cock’s, and perhapsmost importantly of all, one leg longer than the other. Asmodeus is proverbially the limping devil. Hehas a limp, and a close association with Tubal Cain, the Bible’s first blacksmith. Hephæstus, the godof blacksmiths who fell from heaven also had a limp. This god was covered rather thoroughly in aformer volume, but the connections are powerful. Hephæstus was the Greek name for a majorindigenous deity in the region, so important he had more temples than Zeus. Longstanding confusionhas existed between Chaldean and Zoroastrian peoples and cultures in this region. This as well aslater religious agendas has obscured the local fire cults and worship of the dævas. All considered,placing Æshma in the context of the region where Tubal Cain traditionally dwelt is a very naturalstep.Leave this aspect of his complex identity aside for now. Ashmedai also lusts after mortal women,just as in later demonology Asmodeus is as often depicted as a demon of lust as of wrath. In Frenchdiabolism of the pre-Revolutionary period he is invoked in works of lust along with Astaroth asprinces of Amity. This lustful nature is not proof of identity with the fiend Asmodeus either, though itmerges readily with our hero’s maternal lineage.Nevertheless, there remain the linguistic difficulties; that Æshma Dæva does not appear in Persian,while a derivation of dai from dæva cannot be demonstrated. Even so it is clear that the Asmodeus ofthe Testament is, appropriately for Æshma, both murderous and a bringer of discord.More clarity arises when Jewish demonology is considered in greater detail. Naturally some of thetraditions are later than the period of Persian influence. Nevertheless, as in our studies of Romantradition (particularly the Lares and the Manes), it is less important to know the original form whenconsidering the subsequent influence on magical tradition as we receive it.Briefly, there are three forms of demons in Jewish lore:The first – known as Jewish demons – were created by God on the sixth day, the Sabbathintervening before he could give them bodies. These demons are neither evil nor hostile to man. Theyserve God, and even study the Torah. They may grow resentful of humans, for, among other reasons,envy of their physical forms. These spirits came to dwell between the Earth and the Moon, in otherwords they are sublunary spirits; a type we have met with fairly frequently. Not innately hostile, theycan be roused to enmity to a particular human through the actions of the person concerned. Suchpeople are explicitly bad characters, and include the evil sorcerer or witch. Such persons are"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"detestable to these spirits; the devout need have no fear of them.It is of this type of aerial demons that Ashmedai is king in talmudic tradition. A further point is bestmade well in advance of discussion of the third, klipothic type of demon in Jewish lore. There is anaccount in the Zohar of Ashmedai being Solomon’s teacher and moreover bestowing a book of magicupon him; it is to this first category of spirits that this tradition belongs. Ashmedai as the real authorof the Key of Solomon is rather a turn around, at the least.The second type consists of the more dangerous children of Lilith. Though many traditionsconcerning them regard them as wholly evil, there is also variation regarding their precise nature.There are the numerous daughters of Lamia figures who resemble their mother or queen in allrespects. There are also male and female demons considered as ruled by and conceived by her. Sotoo her children or subjects are often synonymous with the dead.If nothing else, the latter demands pause for reflection. As seen in the study of the Roman dead, fear ofthe dead does not preclude reverence for them, customs and traditions often reflect both, and dividinglines move back and forth. The same ambivalence of attitude applies equally to such figures asHecate, originally a Great Goddess. Later when devalued to queen of ghosts and witches, this viewnonetheless co-existed with her role as major goddess of the Theurgists. Similar considerations applyto Persephone, and indeed her female attendants.The problem so far as defining our hero is concerned is his relations with Lilith. As a king ofdemons he is even on occasion married to all four demon queens! Many traditions consider lamiæ andtheir queen wholly evil; Lilith is a fearsome figure in Jewish lore. Nevertheless there is room forconsidering this second type of demon as ambivalent and intermediate. Briefly, three points validatethis; Ashmedai is as strongly linked to this class of spirit as the first; traditions concerning the deadare ambivalent rather than wholly demonic, and positive forms of the Lamia figure – who is anegative reflex of a divine female – are by no means unknown. A case including king, queen andsubjects is a hard hand to beat, still less dismiss.The third class of Jewish demons involve the kabbalistic concept of Sitra Akhra. Without going intotoo much detail, Sitra Akhra is the source of evil in Creation, and its occupants are the klipoth. Whilea far more esoteric conception than the popular view of Hell and evil demons, this represents theclosest to it in Jewish thought. Anything originating in Sitra Akhra is inimical to man, dangerous andevil. Nevertheless it requires stating that the Kabbalists distinguished between three klipoth beyondredemption – destined for destruction at the end of things – and others greater in number destined forredemption (a Jewish equivalent of the doctrine of Restitution).Here again we encounter complications in our understanding of Asmodeus. The demon Samael –himself far from clear cut – is sometimes said to dwell in Sitra Akhra, and traditions concerningAsmodeus are often shared by Samael. For example Lilith as Queen of demons is as often paired withSamael as Asmodeus. Samael and Lilith in some traditions are resident in Sitra Akhra and deemedKing and Queen of the klipoth. As has been seen however, such traditions cannot be deemeddefinitive or universal. Just as Jewish demonology is nuanced, so too is Western demonology, and theequivalent folklore and its preceding mythology. There are great difficulties in considering the klipothas equivalent to grimoire spirits, not least their resemblance to savage and implacable beasts, andtheir residence in a realm wholly distinct from our own – not too different from Tartarus as regardsinaccessibility and separation. Tartarus for most confined there is inescapable; it is not a naturalresidence of those trafficking intelligently with wise men, or those considered dangerous but movingreadily among us. Movement to and from such places is exceptional at best."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"TMatters of the klipoth and the implicit dualistic view of the problem of evil cannot be entirely oreasily dismissed. Nevertheless, there is much to be learned from considering the sublunar sphere asthe true centre of Western demonology and spirit work. So too our view of Asmodeus has to benuanced, by some readings hostility from Asmodeus may be richly deserved. Both powerful andpotentially dangerous, the Zohar nevertheless teaches that he was the benefactor of Solomon.Other Guises and SurprisesHE JEWISH ENCYCLOPÆDIA makes oblique mention of Solomonic legends in which Asmodeus alsogoes by the name of Saturn, Marcolf or Morolf. One might imagine these legends appear inkabbalistic or pseudo-epigraphic sources. Though there are Hebrew texts on parallel lines, thisis not the case. Although influenced by Jewish literature at some points these legends appear in asurprising variety of languages: Russian, German, Latin and French, as well as Old English withprecedents in Anglo-Saxon culture. There are strong influences from Germanic cum Scandinavianpoetic and wisdom traditions. Traces of the same lines of descent can be found in Grimms’ FairyTales: the spirit Mercurius found in a bottle is most closely descended from Marcolfus.Incidentally Marcolf, as well as a supposedly rustic and uncouth trickster who frequently outwitsSolomon, is inclined to misogyny. This may or may not represent Solomon’s reputation with foreignqueens and their goddesses. Where lust and chastity are concerned myth takes some strange turns.There are intriguing elements of letter mysticism in some of the Marcolf/Saturn tales, quite distinctfrom Kabbalah. These include an account of the powers in the letters of the Paternoster. Runes areencountered alongside the Latin letters, and this tradition is a major source for knowledge of Englishrunes. So too the association of Woden with Wednesday and Mercurius is referred to directly.Although apparently separate from this literature, the connection of rune giving Woden with GermanicWild Hunt and Monstrous Horde traditions should be mentioned. Woden in this guise providesanother angle on Asmodeus, demon kings and their followers in European tradition.In this literature Marcolf predates the English texts that feature Saturn. Nevertheless Saturn isplainly used as representing pagan – in this case Chaldean – wisdom. Saturn in these tales isostensibly not the planetary god but a king of Chaldea with whom Solomon disputes. Someinterpreters of the Marcolf tales profess to derive Marcolf from Moloch, citing unpleasant affinitieswith Saturn as Kronos. Naturally the cultural influences on this textual and oral tradition have beenargued at length regarding their primacy and proportion. Hebrew influence for some components isinarguable, and Christian elements are obvious; without doubt however European paganism andfolklore are a major component.The plot thickens considerably when one considers the name Hasmoday or Chasmodai that occursin magical and geomantic writings of the German magus Agrippa. In these guises Ashmedai is a spiritof the Moon, and I say guises advisedly. This spirit is perhaps best known in connection with the wellknown planetary magic squares of the Three Books of Occult Philosophy; specifically the magicalsquare of the Moon, from which a sigil of the spirit may be extracted. The square in question isnotorious for the length of the name of its Intelligence of Intelligences, the supposed ruler of the spirit.This name has five separate parts, beginning with Malach (or Malcha), the Hebrew for which couldas readily be transliterated as Moloch.So far so good, however, the same planetary spirits associated with these magic squares appearagain in the geomancy of the Fourth Book, with different simpler sigils (and no controlling angels)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Chasmodai is still attributed to the Moon, and rules the figures Populus and Via. This makes it all themore surprising that the sigil of the spirit here is identical to the reaping hook symbol of the planetSaturn – associated with the Asmodeus character in the Marcolf literature. Interestingly enough, moreor less contemporary with the publication of Agrippa’s works our ‘Oriental’ Four Kings begin to bementioned in connection with existing Germanic Monstrous Horde traditions.This underlines the organic cross-cultural naturalisation process at work in magical mythologies.Classical and indigenous traditions interweave with Jewish or Christian influence both in populartradition and the grimoires. A true assessment of the task of revitalising Western magic via thegrimoires recognises the critical role of mythology (the study of myth); whether Jewish, Christian orPagan, or indeed all at once.In practice it may also suggest lines of work via geomantic symbols, magic squares and runes inrituals of Asmodeus.Thus prepared a new examination of the spirit as he is best known to modern occultism is possible;it is time to turn to the Lemegeton. A retranslation of Weyer’s spirit list should be on the academicagenda of modern occultism; for the time being a composite of Scot and Mathers may serve:32. Sydonay alias Asmoday [or Asmodeus], is a Great King, strong and mighty. He is seen withthree heads, whereof the first is like a bull, the second like a man, the third like a ram; he hath aserpents tail and belches flames out of his mouth. He hath feet like a goose, and sits upon aninfernal dragon carrying a lance with pennon in his hand; he goeth before all other under thepower of Amaymon. When the conjuror hath a mind to call this spirit, let it be abroad, let himbe wary and standing on his feet; if his cap be on his head, he will cause all his doings to bebewrayed, which if he do not Amaymon will deceive him in all things. But so soon as Asmodayis seen in the form said, let the conjuror call him by name saying thou art Asmoday; he will notdeny it, and presently will consent to bow to the magician. He gives the ring of virtues; heabsolutely teaches geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and mechanical arts. To all demands heanswers fully and truly, he makes a man invisible, he shows the places where treasure lies, andguards it, if it be under the legions of Amaymon; he has under his power 72 legions.There are several salient points here. Firstly, his status as a great King is underlined by his threeheads, representing universality. He is mounted on a dragon, representing status certainly and quitepossibly subtexts found in Testament, Cyprian and theurgic solar cult. He bears a flag, suggestinghigh standing in more feudal terms. These and his high standing with another named king underline atwo tier system of directional and/or elemental kings (not necessarily consistent as to persons anddirections). Let us spell this status out. All the spirits of this particular hierarchy are several timesreferred to collectively as kings, and at least nine of the 72 bear the title, and some of the princes maybe such. Transferral of the title king from Solomon to the decan spirits in the evolution of theTestament may make us wary of such use. All this aside, Asmodeus is without doubt to be countedamong one of two groups of four superior to the others, wherein the title great King is whollyappropriate.I suspect some errors may have crept in regarding the conditions necessary to conjure Asmoday.Mention has been made already of diverse ornithological ideas regarding his feet. Such corruptionsaside, it is undoubtedly appropriate to consider special conditions pertaining to conjurations ofAsmodeus.

That the magician should also be standing andbare headed throughout are also highly appropriate notes of respect.Three other important forms of his name occur in Solomonic and associated lore. As Asmodal he isamong the angels of God invoked in the preparation of Wax and Virgin Earth in the Clavicle (KoSII.XVIII). This ritual is necessary for the making of the liming pot for pacts, among others. The existinggeomantic connection of the spirit commends this rite for preparing earth for use in geomancy.Agrippa, citing Trithemius, lists Asmodel as the angel of Taurus (in which incidentally the Moon isexalted). The form Ashmodiel also appears. This angelic status notwithstanding the form Asmodel isalso found – as the ruler of the East – in tabulations of the Kings; evidently identical with Asmoday orAsmodeus. This should not unduly surprise us, as many astrological demons, angels and deitiesexhibit considerable inter-changeability. In fact the attribution to a corner of the Earth and a signunderlines the status of our Kings in the same astrological hierarchy as the decan spirits."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Angels of the Zodiac(collated variants) ANGELSOLYMPIANSMalchidaelAthenaAsmodelAphroditeAmbriel/AmrielApolloMurielHermesVerchielZeusHamalielDemeterUriel/ZurielHephaestusBarbielAresAdvachiel/AdnachielArtemisHanael/AnaelHestia (or Dionysus)Gabriel/CambielHeraBarchielPoseidonNote Asmodel/Asmodeus (lust) corresponds to Aphrodite; Uriel to Hephæstus &c.Adapted to Elemental Schema EAST SOUTH WEST NORTH cardinal MalchidaelAnaelUrielMurielFixed VerchielAsmodelGabrielBarbielMutable AdvachielHamalielAmbrielBarchielNote greater emphasis on Asmodel if fixed signs are taken as elemental rulers."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"TA WORD ON ANGELOLOGYAlthough they are hierarchically superior to men, angels are thought to have significant contactwith the human world, sometimes in the role of teachers. They also display an affinity withhumanity in their ability to perform both good and evil works. While this new notion of angelswas by no means universally accepted, it is the dominant conception of angels in those texts ofJewish magic and mysticism that influenced Christian angel magic.Katelyn Mesler in Invoking AngelsHIS IS NOT PRIMARILY a book about angels, who nevertheless have considerable connection with thesubjects concerned. There are other issues I wish to highlight more, but some attention to angelsis inevitable. Asmodel’s status as a King of demons and astrological angel highlights the oldconnections of Jewish angelology with Western magic in its formative phase; where our main interestin angels resides. My strategy – in The True Grimoire – gave birth to the phrase ‘I don’t do angels,’meaning I was going back to the roots of Goetia, and later ideas about angels were counter-productive. Having become accustomed to the older context, it is time to reintroduce them in theirprimitive syncretic form, rather than after a mistaken modern semi-secular gloss. As mentionedelsewhere, Goetia is as relevant to angels and gods as to demons foul, and neither angels nor demonsare universally good or bad. Both indeed are relevant to this study, and particularly as concerns thedecans.Angelic OrdersORDERWORLDANGELIC CHOIRS From Dionysusthe AreopagiteEARLY cosmology(Pherecydes)1st OrderSuper CelestialSeraphim Cherubim Thrones-Infinite Space Fixed Stars2nd OrderCelestialDominations Virtues PowersFive planets Sun Moon(Higher)3rd OrderSublunarPrincipalities ArchangelsAngelsMoon (Lower) EarthUnderworldThe Decans and AngelologyAngels and decans converge as topics at several points.

Both pro and anti interpretations can be found in occultsources, as elsewhere. Kharakteres, magical symbols addressed as persons, representing the decans (and otherastrological entities) collectively. The ubiquity of characters in indicating persons and symbolsrelates to the important term stoicheia, with several layered meanings of the same kind.Each of these will be addressed at relevant points. In the meantime some context can be establishedfor angels in general.Meaning and OriginHE TERM ANGEL ORIGINATES in the Greek for messenger, and passed into Latin through transliteration.The archetypal Greek angel was Hermes, although the goddess Iris had a similar role and borethe title in the Classical period. The term was also applied to Hecate in respect of hercommunicating with the realm of the dead, and to Apollo as oracle and Vice-regent of laterconceptions of Zeus as transcendent high god. Apollo’s chthonic connections should also be borne inmind in our understanding of this title, thus obviating reliance on transcendental forms.Originally Hermes’ angelic role probably derived from his psychopompic function, rather thandelivering divine messages from Olympus to earth. He is even referred to as the messenger ofPersephone in the early Imperial period (1st–2nd century CE). Under Jewish influence, the role ofangels in paganism developed massively by the 3rd century CE. This was particularly the case inmagic or folk religion. Their role was important in Neoplatonist Theurgy, and subsequentlysignificant in Gnosticism, but the role of popular religion was prior and decisive, as exemplified bythe PGM, amulets &c. Thus by the 2nd–3rd century CE angels were revered in Egypt and Asia Minor,in pagan contexts as well as Jewish, and the greatest fusion of pagan and Jewish ideas concerningthem was in the sphere of practical magic.As regards pagan angels, the angelic nature of Apollo is perhaps the most controversial.Syncretised with Mēn (who was frequently paired with Hecate and Cybele), and already possessinghis own chthonic roles, Apollo could be an old school ‘underworld angel.’ On the other hand in thelate period Apollo is often endowed with a demiurgic power, with Zeus as the high god and Apolloas his Vice-regent; thus a ‘pagan monotheist’ and celestial type of angel. This latter role isexemplified by an inscription of the Oracle at Claros (perhaps 200 CE), couched in languagereminiscent of a theurgic oracle quoted in Comte de Gabalis. God is described with monotheistepithets; self-born, untaught, without a mother and dwelling in fire. Apollo on the other hand, speaksof himself as an angel and a small part of God. An altar on the same site, dedicated to the Most HighGod, suits a Platonic supreme deity, or an IAO of the papyri, acceptable to Hellenised Jews and topagan monotheists alike. In modern practical usage, since a solar-chthonic deity makes equal sense inarchaic Goetia as in late antiquity, and the Vice-regent role in later systems has the same basis, thecontroversy is largely academic.Hecate, who bears the title angel is a mistress of the crossroads; a marshal of ghosts and demons,of elementals in their hosts and their worlds, and a guide – or leader – of souls. Her soteriologicaland eschatological significance in the Chaldean Oracles appears to mirror various forms of folk"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Tbelief in Asia Minor, including various degrees of Jewish involvement.The nature of angels in magic, originating in this period, is far from simplistic, with Vice-regentangels, angels corresponding to natural forces and astrological bodies, angels controlling demons(who also correspond to the same forces and bodies), and fallen angels. Initially in Judaic belief evenevil angels dwelled in one or other of the heavens rather than Hell.Distinguishing angels who control demons from demons who are angels represents somewhat of aquandary, and some grasp of the original context is essential. The concept of thwarting angels debutsin Western magic in the Testament of Solomon; it received its title from modern academia, and wassubsequently popularised in modern occultism by Skinner and Rankine. Such would appear to be aworkable pedigree, presenting few problems for a traditionally minded occultist. For various reasonshowever this is far from being the case.One such reason is the complex relationship of Jews and pagans prior to and during the earlyChristian period; for such syncretism as we see in the PGM undoubtedly includes conscious Jewishcontributions. That is, the syncretism involved Jewish adoption of pagan ideas as much as paganadoption of Jewish. This was very much the case in Asia Minor. The Jews of Asia Minor had beenmoved there from Babylonian communities by the Seleucids. They had never been to Jerusalem, orthe Syrian and Palestinian centres of Jewish orthodoxy, such as it was. Indeed, archaeology hasdiscovered synagogues in Palestine itself where the pavements are decorated with astrologicalmotifs, demonstrating Jewish susceptibility to Hellenistic ideas often ignored by older academics andunsuspected by many occultists. As such the Jews of Asia Minor were saturated with Chaldeanastrological ideas, as well as Persian. In the Jewish syncretism, ideas about astrological gods andother pagan entities were often reshaped in terms of angels.Astrology and AngelsHE ASTROLOGICAL BASIS OF RELIGION in late antiquity is another recurring aspect of this study. Itprevailed throughout the Roman world, being the dominant methodology for interpreting theworld. It had, with some exceptions, a fatalistic cast in which the planets, stars andconstellations were seen as gods and angels ruling human fate.PGM IV.545–71 encapsulates the predicament underpinning the general worldview. The operatorsees the divine order of the skies with its presiding gods rising and setting. After gazing on the disk ofgod and the source of the winds, they see the gods staring and rushing aggressively in their direction.A formula is required to make them benevolent, so that: the world above is clear and circling, andthat none of the gods or angels is threatening you ...Capable of inflicting disease and other unfortunate consequences upon human beings, such gods andangels were feared, even demonised, as much as venerated. This astrological fatalism has importantimplications for perceptions of angels in magic, as may be seen throughout the PGM and in amuletsand defixiones of the period. To begin with, our modern perceptions of ‘angels good, demons bad’,which might tend towards a dualistic interpretation of the thwarting angels paradigm, is completelymisleading.Angels as agents of an astrological universe could be associated with planets, signs and decans. Assuch their nature could be and frequently was ambivalent if not outright dangerous. There were alsoprotective angels, whose nature is important to grasp; they are frequently executors of Apollo-Helios,and some in particular are very close in nature to him. In fact the most important of the protective"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"angels are Vice-regent angels; of whom Metatron is a well known later type. As the Sun wasconceived in this demiurgic role throughout the period, solar angels, especially Michael precede theMetatron figure. Invocations of Helios, IAO and Michael are common syncretic formulæ.Such mediator figures were invoked in Judaism under the influence of Hellenistic culture, particularlyin Asia Minor. Arnold, following Lightstone’s The Commerce of the Sacred, is explicit on otherfeatures of the diaspora concerning angels: the fear of demons and invocation of protective angelswas a specific feature of popular Judaism; belief in demons was ubiquitous; some priests functionedessentially as shamanistic holy men mediating angelic powers for protection and other magicalpurposes. Jewish elements of the PGM, as well as the ToS and Sepher Ha-Razim, support this thesis.Arnold differs from Lightstone, as do I, in seeing these features as unique to the diaspora in AsiaMinor; similar tendencies can be detected in Palestinian contexts, as well as in Judaism in Egypt andSyria. The question nevertheless remains whether shamanic elements existed in normative Judaism atan earlier date, or whether – as was certainly possible – these priests were influenced by the Greekshamans.Jewish magic strongly resembles pagan magic, with the proviso that good and bad angels substitutefor pagan deities and their entourages (CS 59). Those angels who were concerned with a given planetor decan might command a lesser spirit on your behalf, but equally were associated with aninstrument of fate making them ambivalent, or even identical with the demon commanded. OverallMichael emerges as the most prominent of the angels invoked. Such angelology is a feature of popularreligion as exemplified by magical practice, and was as common in Jewish communities as in pagan,with which they were often in close contact. This contact likely extended to Hellenising cult practice,as exemplified by the precinct of the Jewish Sibyl at Thyatira.As Arnold clarifies, Asia Minor is home to a good many inscriptions which mention angels (CS61). He outlines the positions of various scholars respecting this prevalence. This discussioninvolves specific kinds of religious expression found in the kingdoms of Caria, Lydia and Phrygia, allof which give prominence to angels. The angels have been interpreted as essentially pagan,representing mediator figures; either deputies of a supreme god emergent in pagan monotheism, or onthe model of Underworld figures such as Hecate.Such competing supreme gods have already been mentioned, but local examples include TheosHypsistos, and also Mēn. Hermes is of course typical of pagan mediators with Underworld roles.Apollo (often syncretised with Mēn in Asia Minor) should be considered, especially as, like Hecate,angel is one of his contemporary titles. That Mēn in this period appears both as supreme god (CS 76)and – as Apollo – an Underworld angel, is particularly interesting; his relations with both Cybele andHecate are relevant to local traditions, to important shrines and to themes in the PGM. Against theseinterpretations stand other scholars arguing for a specifically Jewish angel cultus, but evidence fortwo way syncretism is undoubtedly present."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"BOOK IIIThe Decans"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"IGODS OF TIMET IS WAY PAST TIME to acknowledge where my interest in the decans and lunar mansions began, andappreciation of their importance in the history of magic. These themes, though long all butignored by modern occultism, were enthusiastically researched by the Warburg Institute as beingof immense cultural significance. It is still impossible to improve on the succinct comments ofFrances Yates: Into the Hellenistic astrology which is the background of the philosophicalHermetica an Egyptian element had been absorbed, namely the thirty-six decans ... [which] werereally Egyptian sidereal gods of time who had become absorbed in the Chaldean astrology andaffiliated to the zodiac. Thus indeed the decans originate with the ancient Egyptians, whose yearbegan with the heliacal rising of the star Sothis (Sirius) in Cancer. The corresponding decan wasattributed to Sothis; who ‘looked back’ at the decans to come.Simplistically speaking the decans would rise with the Sun for ten days each year until thereappearance of Sothis, the first and last. As this cycle continued and the decans progressed to theWest they descended into the underworld, not to reappear for 70 days. There is wide agreement thatthey are the origin of the 24 hour clock, and also of planetary hours. At the time of the heliacal risingof Sothis in the summer twelve decans rose before dawn. Ten hours of daylight, to which were addedan hour of twilight at either end of the day, gave us the 24 hour clock. Initially these hours were equaldivisions of day and night. In time the equinoctial hours when day and night are of equal length, wereadopted as standard. This historical excursion is important to establish that by the ‘god of the hour,’mentioned in various magical papyri, was intended the current decan lord rather than a planetaryruler. This is an indicator that the decans are of general rather than specialised significance in theevolution of grimoire magic.From the time of the Middle Kingdom they appear frequently painted on coffin lids. Many lists ofdecans are known, involving considerable variation. In the New Kingdom royal tombs contained listsof the decans; extended to royal officials in the time of Rameses I (1292–1075 BCE). In the tomb ofRameses VI (1145–1137) the decans are depicted worshipping the resurgent god of the Sun. Theirreputation appears at first to have been wholly benign. Up to the Late Period they were depicted intemple and tomb art. Tombs of the 18th and 19th Dynasties have ceilings painted with the decans,elaborate versions in the tombs of Rameses IV and Seti I both portray their night journey as for 70days they travel through the underworld. The origins of their ambivalent reputation begin in the 21stDynasty (1075–945), when some officials began to wear amulets protecting them from particulardecans.Initially independent of the zodiac, in the Ptolemaic era these decans were assimilated to theGreco-Babylonian system; they have been a feature of Western astrology ever since."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Diurnal & Nocturnal SectsThe subject of the decans obviously involves the Sun, a ruler of fire and pre-eminent by day. Withsuch an emphasis it is necessary to keep sight of other things concerned in our study; mattersterrestrial, lunar and nocturnal.One way of achieving this involves Hellenistic astrology, the framework within which much ofancient occultism was structured in the Synthesis period. In the past I have referred to elements ofPaganism and myth hidden in technical details of astrology. This is particularly true perhaps of thedecans and lunar mansions.Various features of Hellenistic astrology bear on this; of particular interest is the idea of planetarysects. This divides the planetary gods, and their elemental and zodiacal counterparts, into diurnal andnocturnal sects. These sects are ruled by the Sun and Moon respectively, with additional details asfollows.Mercury is either diurnal or nocturnal depending whether he is placed before the Sun, as MorningStar, or behind as Evening Star.

For example, the division into solar and lunar, diurnal and nocturnal matches the involvementof aerial spirits (decans and mansions) with Apollo and Hecate in theurgic eschatology. Over-simplifying slightly, this involves benign spirits inclined to help, and potentially malign onesrequiring intercession.

So too, nocturnal planetsshould be above the horizon at night, below it by day. This area of concern was one of the mostemphasised dignities of the planets in ancient astrology. The difference between day and night chartswas taken very seriously indeed. That the Part of Fortune (Tyche) has different formulæ, dependingon whether it is calculated by day or by night, also reflects these ideas. Again, cosmological thinking,both mythic and magical, is represented in astrology; it can also, so to speak, be reverse engineeredfrom astrology into magical and mythical expressions.Note also that Saturn as a diurnal planet is considered far more benign above the horizon, hisproper place, than below it. Saturn as a diurnal planet, in the sect of the Sun, reflects mythic andcosmological ideas. Saturn was regarded as the star of the Sun in Chaldean lore. Their relationshipvia their timekeeping roles has been mentioned. Kronos as ruler of the Golden Age, or of the Fieldsof Elysium, is encoded in these technical details of astrology. The placing of dark and cold Saturn inthe diurnal sect, and hot, fiery Mars in the nocturnal, involves sophisticated astrological thinking also;negating their worst sides by preferring the compensating factors.The signs as well as the planets are considered masculine and feminine, matching their diurnal andnocturnal associations. Thus while decans and mansions appear to function independently, there is anintermixture of solar and lunar currents within the workings of every chart, with both factors presentat all times. This too is reflected in ritual, with the solunar patrons bestowing help from benignspirits, protection from malign ones.Zodiac with Lunar Mansions"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"TEGYPTIAN AND HERMETIC DECANSThe decans were always called ‘gods’ by the proponents of the Egyptian tradition.A. Bouché-Leclercq, L’Astrologie GrecqueHE DECAN SPIRITS began as gods. In the fusion of ideas in antiquity, wherever Egyptian influencewas strongest this identity was retained. This included Hellenised astrologers like Hephestionof Thebes whose astrology was transposed from the Sothic to the Aries start point. Hephestion(otherwise Hephæstion) was an astrological writer of Egyptian descent in the early 5th century. HisApotelesmatika involved sympathies with the more mythological astrology of Dorotheus of Sidon (1stcentury) among others and a wish to reintegrate it with the dominant rational astrology of ClaudiusPtolemy (2nd century). He is an important source as a compiler of the earlier strains of Hellenisticastrology when the emergent synthesis underlying the Western system was taking shape. The detailshe provides of the decans in Greco-Egyptian astrology are among the most authoritative we possess.Elsewhere, under Chaldean or Jewish influence, the decans developed or endured various otherguises: syncretic arrays of cosmopolitan deities; opposed gods in pairs; demons with thwartingangels; demons pure and simple. In all these forms however, once absorbed into the astrologicallybased synthesis of the Hellenistic world they exerted a powerful and lasting influence. Their elastichierarchical structures, which are and always were self-contained pantheons, had a powerfulinfluence on all subsequent Western demonology in and out of the grimoires. The Egyptian influenceupon words of power in magical texts consists of exactly such lists of nigh unintelligible names. Thespirit images of the Goetia of Solomon, of surreal zoological forms, emerged with all their variouscharacteristics from those of the mansions and decans. Equally the tabulated amuletic images, stones,herbs and animals, sympathetic and antipathetic, either originated or comprehended much traditionallore in their expansive embrace.With so extensive a role it is important to understand from the outset the underlying principles,practical and theoretical. It must be borne in mind that the Egyptian decans were not originally similarto the Hellenistic conception. The number was not originally fixed at 36, the decans were not of equalsize; moreover their names and order changed a good deal (HWA 20). More importantly theyoriginally evolved quite separately from the zodiac, nor were they confined to the ecliptic. Like themansions they were originally wholly identified with stars and constellations. Even though connectedwith the Sun’s rising in the East, they stretched even further from the ecliptic than do the lunarmansions, extending to the tropics. In the papyri and earlier they also had a relationship of some kindwith the Polar constellations. Originally the term decan was not a definition, the form bekan is foundin Egyptian, among other names; the resemblance to deka meaning ten in Greek is completelycoincidental. Nevertheless, the importance of the numbers 10 and 36 in Pythagorean thoughtcommended this division to the Greeks, while zodiacal and planetary concerns and attributions wereimposed in line with the Chaldean system.In accepting conventional astrological ideas into our modern handling of the decans – and indeedthe mansions – it is necessary to emphasise certain provisos. Firstly, the conventions of Tropicalastrology employed do not cancel the importance of individual star positions and constellations, onlyenable calculations in relation to them; outlining my objections to beginning with a Siderealastrological system would require too much of a digression even by my standards. Secondly, distancefrom the ecliptic is largely irrelevant; any star – even Polaris – can be related to a degree of celestial"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"longitude. Reinhold Ebertin’s existing work with the fixed stars has already introduced this concept toour era (Fixed Stars and their Interpretation), contradictory though it is to conventional astrologicaldogma:Some fixed stars are of very great declination from the ecliptic. Some ... are of the opinion thatfixed stars with large declination, and if more than 23 degrees away from the celestial equator,are of no use in practical interpretation. Practice, however, does not bear out this opinion.Moreover, practice shows that this declination does not appear to matter at all.In this way both mansions and decans can retain their stellar character and observational importancewithin a Tropical schema. At the same time, in accord with astrological thinking and post-Sothicdecans, the solsticial and equinoctial points are granted similar status to the important fixed stars andconstellations."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"TSothisHE FIRST DECAN OF CANCER holds a salient position in many themes running through this schema.Cancer represents the Gate of Men as Capricorn the Gate of the Gods, a critical polarity in thesidereal eschatology emerging from Egyptian and Chaldean traditions (Geo, appendix II).Direction, decan and star each leave an imprint on the grimoires’ dramatis personæ and practice. Asone of the four cardinal points both a decan ruler and a ruler of the quarter emerge from theastrological synthesis of ancient myth. In the older Egyptian systems Sothis was the leader of thedecans as they followed the Sun out of the underworld from the East. The former leader of the decansin ancient Egypt, most important star in their astronomy, marker of the year and major goddess. Shecomes – via decan lore and its influence on Solomonic magic – to a status in the spirit hierarchiesstill extant; this despite later perceptions of demons as male only.Nevertheless, the nature of decans and Sothis in particular is complex. Sirius brought both the Nileflood and blasting solar heat, fertility and epidemics. Sothis is derived from Sopdet, the femininename of Sirius in Egypt. Sopdu, signifying scorching heat, was a male war god linked to Horus. Thismale deity was also associated with the heliacal rising of Sirius. So too solstices were connectedwith Anubis in Greco-Roman times at the latest. Accordingly the spirit hierarchies of latter timesinherit male figures as well as female from deities of this star in ancient Egypt. However, this is verydefinitely not a case of either/or, but all.The deceased in the Pyramid texts is spoken of as the son of Sothis, Sekhet and Sheskentet. Sekhetparticularly was a form of Hathor who was identified with Sirius; rising as a star with the sun godRa, like a crown on his forehead. A much misunderstood goddess in modern times, she had importantunderworld roles. The dead could have no rest, food or safety without her powerful aid and support.She participated in the weighing of souls and gave her decree for the happiness of the individual afterdeath. The hopes of the dead were frequently associated with Sirius, through the intercession of Nuitthey hoped to shine in the sky as Sothis does when it rises before the Sun. Sothis was also identifiedwith Isis, an association which increased as Isis became the premier Egyptian deity of late antiquity.Decan Rulers(Chaldean order)"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"While the Egyptian background includes much complexity, as well as changes over time, the briefoutline here brings out several salient points to our overall purpose. There is a female figureassociated with Sirius, with provision for a male chief in all male series such as the Four Kings. Thenature of this starry decan is as connected with eschatological matters as with fertility, and has apronounced dark or hot side, connected with both excess of solar heat and with epidemics. Thegoddess Hathor exemplifies many aspects of this background more adequately than what is usuallyunderstood by Venus; although the latter, as a primeval goddess, more than meets the same criterion.As the decan is by definition stellar rather than planetary or elemental, the highest echelons of thespirit hierarchy are associated with it.In texts attributed to Hermes and to Enoch magical images of Sirius are spoken of. These agree thatthe images are that of a beautiful young woman, or of a hare. As Festugière observed, the hare –Lepus – is between Orion and Canis Major, and one could therefore conjecture that the list to whichthe engraving originally belonged included the hare in place of the dog. He offered another and betterexplanation. Sirius, in these texts, is connected to Venus: the golden hare is a classic symbol of love.So too he noted that the relationship between star, stone, plant and talisman can be usefully comparedwith similar prescriptions of the decans. A talisman comprises firstly a figure engraved on a stone,below which was inserted a fragment of the plant. Secondly a sign or magical character such as thosereproduced in the manuscripts. Agrippa plainly had access to various such texts, and reproducessome of the details. Unfortunately he also combines elements from such texts, mixed together, andspreads references to stones, plants, magical images and characters in various chapters. Thus thesimple combination of image, character, stone and a single plant has become obscured by collation"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"into lists from other sources. The ring of Sirius comprises a beryl beneath which is savin; juniperussabina. The stone is engraved with a beautiful woman – the connection between Sothis and Venusreaches into myth before astrology – and the sigil of Sirius. Agrippa also mentions mugwort,dragonwort and the tongue of a snake as pertaining to Sirius; which however do not belong to thisparticular ring.Note well that the planetary attribution to the decans beginning and ending with Mars attributesVenus to Sirius and Sol to Chnoumis preceding it. Also, due both to precession and to calendarreform in Roman times, Sirius no longer occupies the same position at the Summer solstice. Sirius hasnowadays precessed into the second decan of the sign. The role of Anubis in relation to the solsticeline – a fixed astronomical point – is not dependent on Sirius. Therefore in our times we can rightlyassociate Nebiros with the solstice line while Astaroth equates with Sirius. In fact a very simpleallocation of the chiefs and deputies to the first nine ‘mansions’ produces exactly these positions.This schema places the Chiefs and Deputies on the Tree of Life, the Chiefs to the Middle Pillar, theDeputies to the sides, and then attributes them to the mansions following the same numerical order."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Figure of Chiefs on the Tree of LifeThis attribution starts with Lucifer in 1st position, with his two deputies crowning the two sidepillars, 2nd & 3rd, 4th and 5th side positions are allotted to the deputies of Belzebuth, who is placedcentrally and 6th.

The intermediateEnglish version given in Scot, while derived from Weyer is far from perfect (the translator wasnot Scot incidentally; he picked the text up during his researches). Reliable assignment of gender in orvia the translated catalogue(s) and the Latin is far from reliable throughout, and this is particularlynotable in the case of Paimon; our ‘King of the West.’ That the Paimon of the GoS is one of our FourKings – not a subordinate spirit – is also shown by the frequent attendance of two lesser kings,musicians and a sizeable retinue, which speaks amply of superior status. I give an alternativetranslation of some of Weyer’s opening lines here:Paimon [when] constrained by divine vertue to stand before the exorcist putteth on humanshape, sitting on a dromedary, and weareth a glorious crowne, and hath a female face.Hermetic style magical images may well represent the oldest aspect of the tradition Weyer and otherstransmit, and even with an ‘all angels are male’ paradigm in place we should be alert to contradictingechoes of earlier tradition. Regarding this passage, Scot has he putteth on a man’s shape which is aviable translation, but there is no he in the Latin as in Scot/GoS, and human is equally valid forhominis. Incidentally, in Weyer there is no aside regarding the speed of a dromedary as in Scot.Scot’s source gives Paimon an effeminate face but vultu fœmineo translates literally as femaleface; femina is female, woman; femineus is woman’s, of women, unmanly. Although a Latinist willnotice masculine pronouns appear subsequently, the image of the spirit leaves considerable room fordoubt regarding original gender. Davidson’s young woman mounted on a dromedary is supported byreference to de Plancy’s Dictionnaire Infernal for pictorial documentation; which shows at veryleast some ambiguity. The Livre des Esperitz says unambiguously that Paimon appears in thelikeness of a crowned woman, highly resplendent, and mounted upon a dromedary. The visualappearance and the conception of spirits of both genders in Jewish and pagan lore strongly suggestsmasculinisation was secondary; occurring with the ‘all male rebel angels’ Christian overlay.Mathers’ derivation of Paimon (in Abramelin) from pomn, a tinkling sound or small bell, suggeststhe apotropaic jewellery of high status Middle Eastern women in antiquity, and the similarlyapotropaic bells on camels. In this and other respects, Queen Zenobia of Palmyra, who rode a camelto war with Rome, is an appropriate hypostasis; not however as appropriate as Sheba riding in pompto the court of Solomon.This westward elucidation concluded, the sunlight now returns."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"TSOLAR THEOLOGYHROUGHOUT MY RESEARCH I have become increasingly aware of a continuous and influential strain ofsolar theology in Western magic from Orphism onwards. This theme is associated with both fireand the Sun in various guises. Certain Greek gods, among others, were or became associatedwith this persistent influence. For ease of understanding consider Hephæstus aka Vulcan and theOrphic Sun gods (Geo passim). Egyptian solar theology to which the decans are integral was apowerful influence upon late pagan solar pantheism. In such syncretism Ptah was commonly equatedwith Hephæstus; for example by Herodotus, Manetho and Apollonius of Rhodes (Geo II, ‘Nebiros’).The fiery themes earlier embodied by Vulcan in Asia Minor, and in Mystery rites, fused readily withthe solar theology emanating from Syria and Egypt at this time.Egyptian traditions exerted considerable influence upon the solar theology emergent throughout theRoman world of this period. Influential as the Egyptian decans undoubtedly were, as the structuraldriver of the synthesis, Chaldean astrology gave this syncretic theology many defining features. TheGreco-Syrian roots of astrology as mathematics plus the influence of the rational Ptolemy tended todiminish Egyptian ideas about constellations. By contrast the Eastern origins of Apollo and Helios,eastward leaning Orphism and the Syrian links of Pythagoras represent powerful undercurrents ofarchaic Goetia.This solar theology thus embraces what may be termed Baal theology as well as that of the Egyptiansun gods (for example: Khephra theology. PGM VII.505–28. f 84). Nor, as will be seen at variouspoints, is this pantheistic theology exclusively solar. Very similar ideas concern the Moon.With the Egyptians, therefore, there is another domination of the elements in the realm ofgeneration, and of the powers in them; four of these powers being male and four female, whichthey attribute to the Sun. And there is, likewise, another government of Nature’s dominionin generation, which they assign to the Moon. By dividing the heavens into two, or four, ortwelve, or six and thirty parts, or the doubles of these, they give to the parts a greater or lessernumber of rulers. And over all these they place one ruler, who transcends the rest.Iamblichus, The Mysteries VIII 3Just such a rulership of the elements, winds and decans in the four directions can be seen in our FourKings; of which quartet Oriens is the superior of the four. Incidentally Iamblichus goes on to say thatdespite this important, indeed defining allocation of the terrestrial (i.e. material) gods, the Egyptiansalso revere the intelligible (that is, transcendental powers). In this he is misled by Hermetic ideas thathe takes to be Egyptian (TEH 139). The older Egyptian cosmology, in common with the archaic worldin general, was essentially materialist in terms of physics and ontology; even ideas of a Creatorconceived him as intra-cosmic rather than external. Prior to Greek philosophical influence they didnot think in terms of a matter/spirit duality as in Platonism. The ancient gods were, so to speak,physically numinous. It was how physical was interpreted that differed, since visions and dreamswere also physically numinous. Hence even words for spirit often translate back to wind or breath,not ethereal but physical. Whether or not we share this world view, it is essential to recognise how itis distinct from transcendentalist and dualist conceptions.Ontology aside, the male and female rulers, which originate in Egyptian cosmology, are intimatelyinvolved with the decans and lunar mansions. Of the two there is a greater wealth of materialconcerning the decans, but ample sign of a similar pattern in relation to the mansions (PGM VII.756–"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"94, also the known equivalence of the first mansion and decan of Capricorn). This Egyptian influencehad a potent impact on later spirit hierarchies, as it were avenging the triumph of Chaldean astrology.To illustrate the role of solar theology and the decans in Hermeticism it is necessary first to reviewseveral verses of two key texts of the philosophical Corpus Hermeticum. All these texts take the formof dialogues between Hermes Trismegistus and one or other of his pupils. Interestingly, these twotexts are both addressed to Asclepius, as is the Sacred Book. This philosophical backgroundfacilitates reviewing the practical aspects of decan magic, with its literature, ingredients, spiritcatalogues and other implications."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE DEFINITIONS OF ASCLEPIUSLess poetically known as C.H. XVI, our first text broaches the subject of solar theology and the decans inthe following verses:4 See then in Earth a host of founts of Water and of Fire forth-spurting in its midmost parts; in oneand the same [space all] the three natures visible – of Fire, and Water, and of Earth, dependingfrom one Root. Whence, too, it is believed to be the Treasury of every matter. It sendeth forth ofits abundance, and in the place [of what it sendeth forth] receiveth the subsistence from above.For thus the Demiurge – I mean the Sun – eternally doth order Heaven and Earth, pouringdown Essence, and taking Matter up, drawing both round Himself and to Himself all things, andfrom Himself giving all things to all. For He it is whose goodly energies extend not onlythrough the Heaven and the Air, but also onto Earth, right down unto the lowest Depth andthe Abyss.For the universality of the Sun god – encompassing elements, heavens and underworld – see Geo II.7:‘The Magical Papyri.’7 For He is stablished in the midst, wreathed with the Cosmos, and just as a good charioteer, Hesafely drives the cosmic team, and holds them in unto Himself, lest they should run away in diredisorder.The chariot and the team of horses – who represent the elements or cosmic forces – are typical ofsolar-pantheistic deities of the period. As established in Geosophia this imagery belongs to Helios, aprincipal deity of the preceding Orphic movement; it is common upon gems portraying Abraxas in theGreco-Roman period. His rule over the elements includes personified ‘elementals’ of all ranks.10 Moreover, as His Light is continuous, so is His Power of giving Life to lives continuous, andnot to be brought to an end in space or in abundance. For there are many choirs of daimons roundHim, like unto hosts of very various kinds; who though they dwell with mortals, yet are not farfrom the immortals; but having as their lot from here unto the spaces of the Gods, they watch o’erthe affairs of men, and work out things appointed by the Gods – by means of storms, whirlwindsand hurricanes, by transmutations wrought by fire and shakings of the earth, with famines also andwith wars requiting [man’s] impiety; for this is in man’s case the greatest ill against the Gods.These daimons subordinate to the Sun essentially belong to the decans, although signs and individualdegrees should also be understood here. The ills with which they afflict humanity correspondapproximately to those of the Testament but are evidently not arbitrary. This is their appointed role;and in this context man is not necessarily undeserving of their actions.12 The Sun is the preserver and the nurse of every class. And just as the Intelligible World,holding the Sensible in its embrace, fills it full, distending it with forms of every kind and everyshape – so, too, the Sun distendeth all in Cosmos, affording births to all, and strengtheneth them.When they are weary or they fail, He takes them in His arms again.Notable here is the description of the Sun as parent of all forms. As a demiurge he is the craftsman of"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"all; that this applies to the daimons is clarified in the next verse. This will be resumed subsequently inthe text of the Asclepius, in direct relation to the decans.13 And under Him is ranged the choir of daimons – or, rather, choirs; for these are multitudinousand very varied, ranked underneath the groups of stars, in equal number with each one of them.So, marshalled in their ranks, they are the ministers of each one of the Stars, being in their naturesgood, and bad, that is, in their activities (for that a daimon’s essence is activity); while some ofthem are [of] mixed [natures], good and bad.14 To all of these has been allotted the authority o’er things upon the Earth; and it is they whobring about the multifold confusion of the turmoils on the Earth – for states and nations generally,and for each individual separately. For they do shape our souls like to themselves, and set themmoving with them; obsessing nerves, and marrow, veins and arteries, the brain itself, down to thevery heart.15 For on each one of us being born and made alive, the daimons take hold on us – those[daimons] operating at that moment [of the wheel] of Genesis, who are ranged under each one ofthe Stars. For that these change at every moment; they do not stay the same, but circle back again.These, then, descending through the body to the two parts of the soul, set it awhirling, each onetowards its own activity. But the soul’s rational part is set above the lordship of the daimons –designed to be receptacle of God.Astrological ideas are clear in this account of the rule or dominion of specific time demons overindividuals according to their horoscope. The tendencies within an individual’s chart represent theworking of Fate determined by these spirits. This would extend to particular medical tendencies aswell as personality traits.16 Whoever hath a Ray shining upon him through the Sun within his rational part – andthese in all are few – on them the daimons do not act; for none among daimons or gods hasany power against one Ray of God. As for the rest, they are all led and driven, soul and body,by the daimons – loving and hating the activities of these. The reason, [then,] is not the love that isdeceived and that deceives. The daimons, therefore, exercise the whole of this terreneeconomy, using our bodies as [their] instruments. And this economy Hermes has calledHeimarmene [Fate, Ananke].A detail it is essential to take on board is the following. The Hermetica are not quoted directly byIamblichus or Proclus as the Chaldean Oracles are. Nevertheless, the ideas he attributes to his‘Egyptians’ include Hermetic strands and there is frequent concord of sources and ideas (TEH).Compare the ray spoken of here with that descending in the rite of theurgic conjunction. Thisredeeming ray is sourced through the Sun rather than from him as in the older solar theology.17 The World Intelligible, then, depends from God; the Sensible from the Intelligible [World].The Sun, through the Intelligible and the Sensible Cosmos, pours forth abundantly the stream fromGod of Good, – that is, the demiurgic operation. And round the Sun are the Eight Spheres,dependent from Him – the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, the Six Spheres of the Planets, and oneCircum-terrene [sublunar]. And from the Spheres depend the daimones; and from these, men. And"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"thus all things and all [of them] depend from God.18 Wherefore God is the Sire of all; the Sun is Demiurge; the Cosmos is the instrument ofdemiurgic operation. Intelligible Essence regulateth Heaven; and Heaven, the Gods; thedaimones, ranked underneath the Gods, regulate men. This is the host of Gods and daimones.The role of solar theology and the decans in the root texts of the Corpus Hermeticum, in which theyfollow their technical antecedents, is established in our next text:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE ASCLEPIUS19 ASCLEPIUS: Which deities do you call the heads of things, or sources of beginnings, Thrice-greatest one?TRISMEGISTUS: Great are the mysteries which I reveal to thee, divine the secrets I disclose; andso I make beginning of this thing with prayers for Heaven’s favour.The hierarchies of Gods are numerous; and of them all one class is called the Intelligible,the other the Sensible.The former are called Intelligible, not because they’re thought to lie beyond our senses;truly these are the Gods we sense more truly than those we call the visible, as our argumentwill prove, and if you are attentive, you will see ...There are, then, [particular] Gods who are the principals of every genera, after whom comethose of the genera below that principal.

Interestingly the same title (polymorph, translatedmultiform) appears in a list of attributes of Hecate in PGM VII.781.To continue with our present text:Also the Seven known as spheres have Principals, their proper rulers, which they collectivelycall Fortune and Heimarmene. Thereby all things are changed by nature’s law; perpetual stabilitybeing varied with incessant motion.The Air, moreover, is the engine, or machine, through which all things are made – its Principalis the second [Zeus?]) ... to mortals the mortal and to like the like.These hierarchies of Gods, then, being thus in this way related, from bottom unto top, are thus"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"connected with each other [too], and tend towards themselves; so mortal things are bound tomortal, things sensible to sensible.The whole great hierarchy, to Him the Highest Lord, is not many things, but rather One.

In their unionthere is one [thing], or rather two, from which all things are made; from Matter, by means ofwhich all other things are made, and by the Will of Him, by whose nod their variety is made.These extended quotations from the Hermetica demonstrate clearly the presence of a solar theology,in which the decans play a formidable part. In these Hermetic texts they retain many traces of theiroriginal Egyptian character. They are conceived of as higher than the planets, and indeed the zodiac –from which they were initially completely distinct. It is no leap to assume that they equate with stardaimons and time gods encountered in theurgic rituals of conjunction (see Part 1). This is how in myopinion a highly evolved Theurgic rite – the rising up of plants – came to be mirrored in miniature inthe low magic of the technical Hermetica.Such miniaturisation is a regular feature of magic in the Roman period, temple rites scaled down toindividual practice being but one form it takes. In order to appreciate this particular example it isnecessary to understand the commonest form of talismanic magic in the technical hermetica, the use ofengraved gems with magical roots or plants in the making of magical rings and magical images.Lapidary manuals and fragmentary texts relating to this art survived from antiquity – often via ArabHermeticists like Mashallah (LAG) – to influence Ficino, Bruno and Agrippa. Magical amulets of thistype were once erroneously referred to as Gnostic gems, it being supposed that magicians must havebeen imitating religion rather than the other way round. These items are common enough in thearchaeological record, and I refer to several of them in the course of this work. Hermetic manualsinstructing the magician in the lapidary art are thus part and parcel of popular magic in antiquity andamong the precursors of the grimoires. This will be covered more adequately via the text of thetechnical hermetic manual Liber Sacer or the Sacred Book, an event long overdue in modern magic,which follows after a little more introduction."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"ACONCERNING ANGELSThe Vice-RegentNGELIC VICE-REGENTS in Jewish tradition are an important aspect of our study. My research for thisbook, pursuing angels and magical tradition, brought me frequently to studies of early Christianpolemics against both; in particular concerning the letters of Saint Paul. Solomon, the patron ofJewish exorcism and healing, represented a rival for Christ, whose miracles concern both areas.Similarly, mediator angels were competition for Jesus as mediator between God and man. However,contemporary Jewish communities were all the more ready for the Christian message because of therole such mediators already played in their traditions. This is plain even in much later occultsymbolism, where Jesus and angelic Vice-regents are associated with the same qabalistic spheres.In Guardians of the Gate: Angelic Vice-Regency in Late Antiquity, Guggenheim award winningprofessor Nathaniel Deutsch refers to the angelic vice regent as a mythological figure; and goes onto place this important figure, by no means always an angel, within the broader study of myth.Different though our goals are, his assessment is of the very first importance here. The Vice-regentis a central figure in traditions of angelology, is a form of the intermediary spirit central to the ArtArmadel ritual form discussed in True Grimoire, and of the first importance both to Goetia and toNew World traditions. Deutsch goes on to indicate the connections of the Vice-regent with variousmythological themes, including the creation of the world. This is performed either as a demiurgicfigure or alternatively a close associate of the demiurge. The relevance of this to the solar theologyand its central figures is evident. Central figures, moreover, whose connections with our subject areof the very first importance.Such figures possess some or all of the following attributes, here given as titles. Besides thedemiurgic role he is also Guardian of the Gate. For our purposes this is of an eschatological realm,not limited to a monotheistic abode of God as in Deutsch’s thesis. He is a Ruler, sometimes a king ofmen, or a commander of angels or other divine beings, or both. Deutsch relates other attributes:Judge, often in an eschatological sense, which can in any case be implied, and Priest. With relevancebeyond the particular theological case our author pursues, he indicates the role of the Vice-regent asdivine hypostasis (as Apollo is the ‘visible face’ of the One of the Chaldeans).He has also a definite ambivalence, essential to his role, embodied by other importantcharacteristics. This Deutsch calls composite or hybrid ontology, that is, he has characteristics ofmore than one level of being, whether divine, angelic or human. It need hardly be pointed out thatangelic could equally be expressed as daimonic; both angel and daimon represent an intermediatestate between man and god. However a mediator figure may be half way between any of thesecategories, men and angels or daimons, or between god and the lesser divinities, and so on.Many of these characteristics are equally true of another important mythological type, namely theTrickster. Again not every trickster possesses all of them, any more than every Vice-regent in everymythology does. Also, while the Trickster and Vice-regent possess similarities, it is necessary todistinguish them carefully from one another. The relationship of both with the high god is equivocal,but the Vice-regent nevertheless acts with higher sanction or delegated authority; the Trickster,usually lacking it, operates by means of cunning and the trickery from which he takes his name. Theconvergence of the two roles is nevertheless highly significant. The Guardian of the Gate is a title"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"equally appropriate to either, and the gate represents, of course, a liminal space between worlds. Aparticularly important form of this ‘space’ is the crossroads, and the equivalence of gate andcrossroads is illustrated in the mythology concerned in the present study. The junctions of the zodiacand the Milky Way are the Gate of the Gods and the Gate of Men. This, illustrates too that the gatespresided over by such figures are implicitly or explicitly eschatological.Deutsch, a major scholar himself, invokes many great names of the scientific study of myth to hisaid. Their opinions regarding the roles these mythological types possess have great relevance in theirwork, and also that of the magician.Worlds meet where the Vice-regent or Trickster operate, they are central to mythology, and in factessentially embody its language. The mystical and religious transformations humans experience areexemplified by the mediator types (Vice-regent or Trickster). The dualities mediated can take manyforms, as the scholar of this or that religion or tradition will know. An analogy Deutsch raises inpassing is the novice in a male puberty rite, who is neither man nor boy as the Vice-regent is neitherman nor god. This is particularly interesting since the Classical Apollo is often represented as anephebe; an idealised candidate for the rite of passage of adolescent youths. This same figure, throughancient syncretism, was a ‘pagan’ equivalent for figures such as Metatron; a focus of Deutsch’s thesis.More central for us are ‘folkier’ angels such as Michael, whose nearness to Helios-Apollo is keenlyfelt throughout the PGM.Michael either is or is close to a solar demiurge and is the commander of angels in general. Such asolar chieftain is particularly closely associated with the decans, and his name is associated with thefirst of them. Michael is the thwarting angel of the first of Solomon’s decans (ToS). He can thuscompel hostile angels as well as command benevolent ones, and holds a truly remarkable place inmagical traditions, including the Goetic.Deutsch and his cited authorities, even while at variance in some respects, speak of the Trickster(and by implication the Vice-regent) as embodying the logic of mediation whereby myth andtransformation are expressed. More than mythological figures, which might be said of characters withlesser roles, they are mediators, in a mythic narrative to which they are actually essential. So toosome argue, they are more than that. They symbolise or embody the very process of myth-making,since without mediation all other roles would be static and two dimensional. Myth as a descriptiveand prescriptive dialectic is expressed and lives through them.This same logic of mediation underlines an important role which many such figures possess; theintermediary role in magic, wherein such figures are typically invoked before all others. Here too,absence of the intermediary represents stasis; no living ritual tradition exists where their role isabsent. The importance of the Armadel model in magic has been discussed already. Withoutnecessarily returning to the ‘ritual school’ of mythological studies, the parallel is plain; ritual, likemyth, is expressed and lived through the same logic of mediation, the intermediary is essential toboth.A figure closer to the centre of our theme is mentioned several times in relation to this argument;namely, Hermes. The formula Hermes Metatron Yah can even be found on Aramaic incantationbowls (Deutsch, 167). Hermes, like Metatron, could be represented as a boy or an old man. The samepolarity is found in manifestations of Legba, who can appear as a tattered old man with a stick, or asa young boy. Hermes as Logos brings both Trickster and Vice-regent together in one person, even ifby means of syncretism, for example by combination of Hermes and the Egyptian Tahuti or Thoth.As the ‘enemy of boundaries,’ if only to establish new ones, or the spirit of disorder, if only toreaffirm the status quo, the trickster should remind us of another god of the PGM, the enemy of Osiris,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Typhon-Set. Thrice Great Hermes and Typhon-Set in different ways approach a junction of theTrickster and Vice-regent; whether either ever transcended – or can transcend – the distinctionsinvolved remaining arguable. Typhon-Set was certainly involved with solar pantheism, and hadpower over angels and gods, but some aspects of the Trickster cannot sit well with the role of Vice-regent. The Trickster can – like the cunning and ferocious Set – be an ‘outsider,’ a rival or an enemyof the high god, he can certainly trick one, as Prometheus and Hermes do. Equally – like the Vice-regent – he can be an accomplice or enforcer of the high god. Indeed for the roles to draw yet closer,which, despite their similarities, most of the time they do not, this aspect of the Trickster has to bepresent.An important figure who comes very close to transcending the boundary between Trickster andVice-regent can be found in the New World traditions. At the root of the Exu of Kimbanda is theAfrican Trickster, Eshu, who is also Marshal of the court of the gods. This echoes the mystery citedby Frisvold in his Exu: the Maioral is in truth the Archangel Michael. The role of Marshal isextremely close to that of Vice-regent, and, bringing the Vice-regent and Trickster so close marksEshu as extraordinary. The sophistication of Kimbanda cosmology and its relevance for Goetia ashere expressed are doubly underlined."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"AORIENSS MENTIONED, in the course of composing this Encyclopædia the role of a solar demiurge becamea prominent aspect of the work. To be precise: late Hellenistic Syrian and Chaldean ideasconcerning a solar-pantheistic deity and the origins of the ‘King of Fire’ in subsequentdemonology. His enduring importance has emerged increasingly in my research, first surfacing in theTrue Grimoire (129–130, 167). This status is present in the magical papyri, in Arab and Byzantinemagic and elsewhere. One name or title of this spirit is Magoa, meaning Magus or magician.Additionally he is clearly identical with the king of spirits identified as Oriens (a title of the Sun godof Imperial Rome, a god moreover with strong Syrian connections).So far as his continued presence in the grimoires is concerned, the matter of the Four Kings is ofcardinal importance, and examples abound. In particular, Oriens in Clm 849 is portrayed as abenevolent ruler, indeed a virtual creator god. Kieckhefer’s inexplicable hypothesis is of a chief deityconstructed by magicians in medieval times; developing upon the primacy of the East amongdirections in the prevailing culture. The likelihood however is that the primacy concerned isconsiderably earlier. Indeed it is unlikely the author’s necromancers or the clerical undergroundwould be involved in feats of original deity construction, but perfectly feasible they would retain anexisting tradition. Such a tradition surrounding a solar demiurge exists in the Chaldean Oracles, inNeoplatonism of the theurgic cast and throughout late Hellenism. Indeed Cumont, as quoted inGeosophia, considered this solar-pantheistic deity the crowning achievement of late pagan theology.My translation of an invocation from Clm 849 illustrates the status of Oriens in the magical traditionas outlined:Oh, benign Oriens, the immensity of the Universe, Heaven and Earth, the celestial andterrestrial orders, were made by your will and foresight. Strengthen my understanding in thiswork, by the dominion of your never-ending kingdom. King, awe-struck in my supplication, Ipray you:By your kings that hold and bind, heal and strengthen, and by all your royal power, by Sotuem,Sortfen, that in a dream this night there comes to me Haram, the benign spirit, to inflame myheart and mind, that I may know to find a treasure, if there is one in these parts, or in others,and lead me, and there let him make the sign of the very reality of the true and the perceived.By thy most holy and most sacred treasure, the sun bright gleaming, white, and resplendent,that your excellence sendeth forth and your manifest and benign power returneth.By all your dignities and rulerships I call witness in my solemn undertaking: vouchsafe tosend a Spirit of truth in a dream this night to reveal a hidden treasure.This may be done towards the east, and still kneeling. Say this prayer three times. When youenter the bed, say, nine times:Oriens, Oriens, Oriens, I pray, I ask, and I desire thee, most merciful Oriens in order to fulfilmy vow, and be thou willing to overlook my transgressions.By your kings ... strongly suggests leadership of the Four Kings, while their powers mirror those of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"the decans in the Testament and its pagan model. Similarly by Sotuem, Sortfen may well mirror theTheurgic practice of conjunction; invoking lesser time gods of the day and hour to assist invocation ofAion. It is also reminiscent of the two deputies allotted the Chiefs in the L:B:A hierarchies. Theinclusion of deputies’ names in invocations to chiefs follows from Theurgic usage in any case.Finally, the little death of sleep and dream mirrors the night journey of the Sun god; permitting himto be invoked to assist in this context. We might hypothesise the spirit Haram to represent HermesChthonios, his messenger. The invocation is in any case extraordinarily interesting. So too it clearlyinvolves the matter of the Kings; and shows that even at this date they could be conceived aspotentially benign.The evolution of this deity in ancient times contains many nuances; at some points a solar deity pureand simple, at others a deity whose visible face is the Sun, who as Lord of Time may simultaneouslycorrespond to Saturn; he also has considerable overlap with the primary chief of the decans. Hisimportance however represents a unified whole, and is evidenced at the root of the Western tradition.This includes the papyri and Jewish angelology (influenced, like Jewish magic, by Chaldeo-Persianand Pagan traditions). His connection with the four solar stations may be seen in this latter as easilyas in other traditions. As Boel he is an exalted throne angel of the 1st or 7th heaven who holds fourkeys to the four corners of the earth, and also governs Saturn. Boel is a powerful presence in thepapyri, and is instantly recognisable in Solomonic texts; whether as king of the Salamanders or in thePrayer for Success in the True Grimoire. Most important in some respects is his identity with theApollo of the Chaldean Oracles, which role places him centrally in the Orphicogoetic substrata ofall subsequent Western magic.This deity then is at the root of our traditions regarding the Four Kings. Due to the variationsfeeding into this tradition at various points there are ambiguities depending on our sources at anygiven stage of study. Oriens is the chief of the Four Kings and also very closely related to the first ofthe decans; other deities and figures have represented aspects of himself or the totality at differentstages. These include chief devils such as Asmodeus (a Dæva of earthly fire in demonised guise, bymy reading). Unifying or distinguishing some of these figures can appear very difficult, although inpractical terms the problem is not nearly so great.The spirit of the first decan of Aries, as intimated already, is the chief of the 36 spirits. As regardsthe Four Kings – and Queens – the first decan of each equinoctial and solsticial sign represents onelevel of their identity. They relate to solar and lunar positions at the four quarters of their cycles;directions, times of day, month and year and so forth. There are essentially two levels at work here,the four spirits as rulers of four divisions within the decan and mansion listings, and four spiritsexterior and superior to those listings. Naturally these two levels are not always clearlydistinguished, but the distinction is present nevertheless.Chenlacori, the first of the decans in Liber Sacer, holds his sceptre or weapon above his head tosymbolise his dominion as leader. Ostanes’ table calls him Aidoneus, a name of Hades, or better inthis context, Dis Pater."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"TOriens and UrielHE MOST PROMINENT ANGELS of Judaic and Christian traditions frequently converge with the FourKings theme, with its Greco-Chaldean background. There are coherent traditions linking theangel Raphael to Boel and Bael. The whole Four Kings theme connects with solar vice-regents,of whom Michael is certainly a pre-eminent type, more recognisable in the PGM than the grimoires,but ever present. His reputation for conquering – or commanding – demons makes him the patron ofmagicians and exorcists of many traditions. Similarly the angel Uriel appears to be convergent withOriens. Firstly Uriens, Urian &c. are known variants of the latter name, and appears frequently inGermanic and other folklore, with likely Jewish influences. He appears – as Urian – in Goethe’sFaust, where he presides over the Walpurgis celebrations on Mount Brocken. In this, as othercontexts, his name is synonymous with the devil, aptly since Lucifer is close to identical with Oriensof the grimoires.Secondly Uriel has a rather dark reputation; Enoch speaks of him presiding over thunder andterror. As good a place as any to begin recounting this is with the so-called reprobated angels. Achurch council convened in Rome in 745 CE reprobated seven angels, which is to say they were nolonger recognised or approved by official doctrine. This was by no means the beginning of theChurch’s opposition to angel worship; which frequently involved magical practices both by the clergyand the laity. Problems with angels can be traced to Paul, as in Colossians and Galatians. Theunorthodox nature and wide distribution of angel magic in Judaism and Christianity need not beconsidered in detail. What matters is that the reprobated angels included Uriel, Raguel and – tellingly– Sabaoth; these are prominent in the papyri and the Testament of Solomon, as well as on manyancient amulets.Uriel (Greek Ouriel) means Light, or Fire, of God, and though uncanonical the name is truly ancient,and signs of his veneration for apotropaic or magical purposes are widely known. The literarytraditions identify him as a regent of the Sun (probably all four angels could claim this, as could theFour Kings). God’s fire and solar connections make his a significant name in linking the angels withthe kings. Solar and fiery connections imply angelic equivalents of Helios and Vulcan. Like Raphael,Uriel presides over Hades, while Michael’s chthonic connections are writ large already; in thesyncretic iconography of the period Michael holding balances mirrors Anubis as an underworld judgeand psychopomp. In the same way that angels were used in Jewish magic as substitutes for paganfigures, 10th century Arabs credited Solomon with the discovery of iron tools (Sarah Iles Johnston,‘The Testament of Solomon from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance,’ in The Metamorphosis ofMagic from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period). This effectively assimilates one patron ofmagic to another, Solomon substitutes for an Idæan Dactyl. To take this prescriptively, given hisprevalence in the PGM Damnameneus is a likely candidate.Uriel in II Esdras represents hopes of salvation in the new age of Christ, while the equallyuncanonical Book of Adam and Eve has him preside over repentance essential to eschatologicalhopes. While the apocalyptic literature often portrays collective or universal eschatology, it is not agreat stretch to connect the dramatis personæ with individual eschatology, and from there to magic ingeneral; the very sphere where late pagan, Jewish and Christian folk beliefs overlap. Just asministering angels converge with our aerial spirits as protectors of ascending souls; so the chiefangels converge with our kings, their commanders, among whom of course is Uriel. As Ouriel he"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"appears in the ToS and is among the angels of the papyri; in the rite called Sword of Dardanos hisname is among those on the sword (PGM IV.1716–1870). Amulets of the 1st through to the 6thcenturies name him frequently prior to his reprobation in 745; and later magical traditions reflect thisbackground, with varying degrees of camouflage.Among the most important references to Uriel in the grimoires, as many readers will be aware, arethe Operation of Uriel Seraphim (MS Grimoire of Armadel) and its analogue Divination by the Wordof Uriel (GV); (for an in context account see True Grimoire, ‘The Art Armadel’). In this he plays therole of intermediary or angelic vice-regent, accessing any or all of the seven angels: Alithael, Anael,Raphael, Gabriel, Cassiel, Sachiel, Samael. The first of these is likely a mistranscription forMichael; which makes Uriel his superior in this particular system. There is a good bit of interchangeof roles among the four elemental angels, much as with the Kings."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"IINTRODUCING THE SACRED BOOKThe Technical HermeticaN APPROXIMATELY 200 CE Clement of Alexandria mentions 42 books of Hermes carried in processionby Egyptian priests. The first priest was the invoking priest, carrying two books of sacredprayer; directly after him came the astrologer with four astrological texts. It was once believedthat some of this literature survived in the Hermetic tradition. Indeed, while the theoretical orphilosophical Hermetica first appear in this period, the practical or technical Hermetica – dealingwith astrology, magic and alchemy – bear a closer relationship to the ancient wisdom literature (TEHpassim) and commence at an earlier date.An anonymous practical Hermetic author of the 2nd century BCE wrote an astrological workattributed to Nechepso and the prophet Petosiris; dealing with Egyptian mysteries and astrologicalmagic. Nechepso himself was a 7th century Pharaoh, to whom such works came to be attributed.According to Proclus he possessed a theurgic invocation of the goddess Necessity, and was learnedin divine and angelic hierarchies. There is every reason to identify some of these angels with thedaimons of the decans. The fragments of these writings preserved by Firmicius Maternus (4th centuryCE) constitute a master key of decan magic. While distinct, it is the closest of the pagan forms toSolomonic. The tables of Maternus follow with his text – roughly translated from Latin – which givesthem context. When the comments of Maternus are compared with the Testament the heavy Paganinfluence on the ‘Jewish’ material becomes very clear. A pagan form of the same conjuring method isdemonstrably prior and – given this key – fully recoverable.SIGNDECANGOD OF DECANPOWER OF DECAN 1ArourisAssicean2AnubisLencher 3HorusAsentacer 1SerapisAsicath2HelitomenosViruaso 3ApophisAharph 1TaatusThesogar2CyclopsVerasua 3TitanTepisatosoa 1ApoltunSothis2HecateSyth 3MercophtaThuismis 1TyphonAphruimis2PerseusSitlacer 3NepthePhuonidie 1IsisThumis2Pi-OsirisThopitus"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 3CronusAphut 1ZeudaSerucuth2OmphtaAterechinis 3OphionusArepien 1ArimaniusSentacer2MerotaTepiseuth/Tepsisen 3PanotragusSenciner 1TolmophtaEregbuo2TomrasSagen 3ZeraphChenen 1SodaThemeso2RiruphtaEpima 3MonuphtaHomoth 1BrondeusOroasoer2VuculaAstiro 3ProteusTepisatras 1RephanArchatapias2SourutThopibui 3PhallophorusAtembuiDecan definition of Firmicius MaternusEach sign is formed from three decans possessing a great Divinity and a Power (potestatis), and bythem all prospering or misfortune [of health] is decided.

Increasing links withBabylonian practice and belief are evident in the development of this magic. The most important ofthe Hermetic astrological works, the Liber Hermetis, involves themes from the 3rd century BCEincluding the Egyptian division of the zodiac into 36 decans. Hermetic decan magic – transmitted tolater Western magic through Byzantine contacts, the Arab Picatrix and Agrippa – anciently involvedcorrespondences to stones, herbs and animals, as well as magical characters, coloured inks and soforth. The images of the Latin Liber Hermetis were undoubtedly influential on Renaissance astrologyand remain prominent in modern astrological magic. However, astrological technique aside, on thespecific subject of decan magic this work has a very serious rival: the Sacred Book. This Greekdecan book has far more complete correspondences: animals, plants and stones, as well as decannames known from monumental inscriptions, and images of the gods more identifiably Egyptian inorigin.

The so-called magical images of the decans (TBOP II.XXXVII)originally represented stellar deities or their subordinate daimons; an origin far clearer in their LiberSacer form. Excerpt VI of the Hermetic Anthology of Stobæus (below) describes these star daimonsas sons or children of the decans. Thus the decan demons of the Testament originate in traditions ofat least the Ptolemaic era, strongly associated with practical Hermetics based on the principles ofsympathia. The lore associated with them is complex, involving plants, stones and formulæ. It isstrongly connected with the god-making formulæ of Hermetic and Theurgic traditions. Theseapplications of the wider practical Hermetica and diverse theurgic operations anticipate the extra-medical applications of the post-Testament Solomonic tradition."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"AStobæusS MENTIONED, fragments of Hermetic writings from the 2nd century BCE were preserved byStobæus. Excerpt VI is given in slightly abbreviated form below. The emphasised sectionsshow the chief areas of interest.Tat. In your former General Discourses you promised to explain about the thirty-six decans; Itherefore ask you to tell me about them now, and to explain their working.Hermes. I am quite willing, Tat; and of all my teachings, this will be of supreme importance,and will stand highest among them. I bid you mark it well. I have told you before about thezodiacal circle, which is also called the animal-bearing circle, and about the five planet-stars andthe sun and the moon, and the several circles of these seven bodies. ... I desire you then, in yourthoughts about the thirty-six decans also, to bear in mind what I have told you, that so my teachingabout the decans also may be intelligible to you.I told you, my son, that there is a body which encloses all things. You must conceive the shapeof that body as circular; for such is the shape of the universe. ...[B]elow the circle of this bodyare placed the thirty-six decans, between the circle of the universe and that of the zodiac,separating the one circle from the other; they bear up, as it were, the circle of the universe,and look down on the circle of the zodiac. They retard the all-enclosing body, for that bodywould move with extreme velocity if it were left to itself, but they urge on the seven other circles,because these circles move with a slower movement than the circle of the universe.And subject to the decans is the constellation called the Bear, which is centrally situatedwith regard to the zodiac. The Bear is composed of seven stars, and has overhead anotherBear to match it. The function of the Bear resembles that of the axle of a wheel; it neversets nor rises, but abides in one place, revolving about a fixed point, and making the zodiacalcircle revolve, transmitting the world from night to day, and from day to night. Let usunderstand then that ... decans stand round about all things in the cosmos as guardians,holding all things together, and watching over the good order of all things.... [T]he decans are exempt from the things that befall the other stars. They are not checked intheir course and brought to a standstill, nor hindered and made to move backwards, as the planetsare; nor yet are they as are the other stars. They are free, and exalted above all things; and ascareful guardians and overseers of the universe, they go round it in the space of a night and aday ... [T]hey act on us most potently. If they act on the heavenly bodies, how could it be that theyshould not act on us also, both on individual men and on communities? The force which works inall events that befall men collectively comes from the decans; for instance, overthrows ofkingdoms, revolts of cities, famines, pestilences, overflowings of the sea, earthquakes, noneof these things, my son, take place without the working of the decans. For if the decans ruleover the seven planets, and we are subject to the planets, do you not see that the force setin action by the decans reaches us also, whether it is worked by the decans themselves or bythe children of the decans or through the intermediary of the planets? ...

The syncretic logic involved is certainly clear, even though many convergent themes areinvolved. To name but two, the Sun below the Earth becomes the Lord of the Underworld (theprototype in this tradition being the Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash, god of law and deliverer fromdisease). So too regarding the medical associations of the decans, Apollo, now fully solar, wasalways a god of disease and his son Asclepius a healer.

The chapter on the decans in Liber Hermetis is – like the corresponding section in the ToS– the oldest part of a composite text. The fragment from Stobæus also clearly places great emphasisupon them. This is in keeping with the role they have in the so-called philosophical Hermetica(Corpus Hermeticum), where too their role is emphasised. This is part and parcel of an archaic fieryand solar theology, overlaid with ideas of a higher deity. The Sacred Book represents a moreprimitive form of the Hermetic decan tradition, with a host of interesting implications for ourpurposes."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE SACRED BOOK OF HERMES TO ASCLEPIUS1I have for you the forms and figures of the thirty-six decans that belong to the zodiacal signs, and it isnecessary for me to show how to engrave each of them between the horoscope, the good daimon andthe position appropriate to the body part. If you do thus, and carry this ring, you will possess apowerful phylactery:For the conditions sent to all men due to the influence of the stars are cured by these decans. So ifyou offer honour to each – through its own stone, plant and image – you will possess a powerfulphylactery. For nothing happens without this decanic provision; it can be seen that it covers alleventualities.2The circle of the zodiac unfolds according to the same parts, members and harmonies as the world; itis distributed as follows:3Aries is the head of the world, Taurus the neck, Gemini shoulders, Cancer breast, Lion the back,shoulder blades, heart and ribs, the Virgin the belly, Libra buttocks, Scorpio the pubis, Sagittarius thethighs, Capricorn the knees, Aquarius the legs and Pisces the feet.4Thus, each zodiacal sign has power over the stones, shapes and forms of the decans themselves, and,after having placed the plant beneath the stone engraved with its image, it will be a phylactery.

In essence then, this vastlycomplex subject, involving precession of the equinoxes, Sothic and Tropical astrology andmore, must be summarised and made accessible. My handling of the characters, an important part ofthis lore, is composed accordingly, establishing some broad principles without omitting importantfactors, or over complicating either. Individual further research thus has considerably better chance ofa clear shot.To begin with, there is a terminology of magic, and the term characters (Gk. kharakteres) has beenpart of the Western magical vocabulary since around the 2nd century. The grimoires are full of them,linear figures, akin to ancient alphabets, their lines and curves tipped with small circles. Moreelaborate sigils of spirits are often referred to with the same term, and for good reason. The simplerforms are undoubtedly the oldest type; singly they represent individual spirits; equally, often a seriesof kharakteres represents spirits in a defined group.The original conception behind them was – academia and magical tradition agree – chieflyastrological. Though not exclusive, a particular association of kharakteres is with the decans. Theyare originally non-alphabetic (although analogies with stoicheia tends that way); magical signs ratherthan an earthly script. Nevertheless it appears that later Hebrew based alphabets, such as CelestialScript, derive from decan characters.Meanings of StoicheiaPRACTICAL STOICHEIAPHILOSOPHIC STOICHEIALetters, charactersThe physical elementsThe alphabet, ABC’sThe planets or starsFoundation or principles (of a science or institution)Elemental or chthonic spiritsFundamentalsSpirits of stars, planets, decans &c.The division into Practical and Philosophic is my own; a magical or philosophical belief in thesignificance of wordplay and nuance explains the convergence of letters and spirits in kharakteres viastoicheia.Despite their quasi-alphabetic appearance, understanding them as a means of communicating with orinstructing spirits is overly simplistic. It is quite apparent from various inscriptions that in some sensethe characters are identical with the spirits themselves. They are referred to as most holy lords,kharakteres, and in other personalised forms. Thus they represent the presence of the powersconcerned, rather than an instruction to them. In this they are close in nature to the magical images andsacred animals which also represent presence rather than being a sympathetic correspondence like theminerals and plants. The distinction operates approximately thus: minerals and plants can providesympathetic inks or surfaces to make characters with; the drawn character itself is an indwelt image.An authoritative inscription of magical characters of the decan gods survives from the ancient"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"world (see Gager 56, fig. 7 and note regarding similar even identical series found elsewhere). It isinteresting to note that this lead cursing tablet was found in Apamea. Of the 36 symbols employed thelast in the series enables us to be sure that the series does not begin with zero Aries. It is a knownsymbol of the decan god Chnoumis/Chnoubis, derived from an earlier Egyptian god. His image, alion-headed serpent with seven rays ascending from the head, often appears with this exact symbol onmagical gems. Hephestion writes of him confusedly, saying that he is a star of Leo in the sign ofCancer. Attributions to both can be found, and it is not certain that the difference concernsconstellation versus Sign. Other indications place him at the end of Gemini, immediately before zeroCancer, representing the old Sothic start point of the decan series. The Chnoumis ‘dragon’ is relatedto the serpent Ouroboros, fittingly for the last decan of the Sothic zodiacal dragon.Chnoumis/Chnoubisfrom an engraved agateLion-headed Chnoubis, with nimbus and seven double rays around the head. In the free space on the left: Chnoubis-sign setvertically, below Chnoubis: two six-pointed stars. On the right, an inscription in two lines: χνου|μεω, a variant of Χνουμ\u0000ς or Χνουμ?Below: αβρασαξ (Aβρασάξ).An approximate but useful association of the kharakteres with the individual decans thus follows,attributing the first character to Sothis rather than zero Aries and distributing the remainderaccordingly. How precession and other matters have affected individual elements over time can wait,there is a good deal of data in the generalised picture obtained from this clue. The Aries point, thenew beginning of the decans, has an interesting character associated with it. A variant of the circledcross, the horizontal line is doubled. It is reminiscent of the Egyptian hieroglyph for town, whichresembles a crossroads. The astrological crossroads is represented by our Four Kings and their signs."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"WThus the doubled horizontal line can be read as the East/West axis of Aries and Libra. This symbol isthus an important schematic of many principles of the decan system.The second sigil is one of the non-unique types in the series, shared with the first decan of Taurusand all three of Aquarius. There may be various reasons for these repeats. Another case is the firsttwo decans of Gemini, the third one being different. Comparing the corresponding mansions suggeststhat this duplication stems from the disparity of numbers between decan and mansion per sign. That is,two decans bearing the same symbol may correspond to one spirit of the mansions.Less speculatively, our Chnoumis sigil being the last of the Sothic or old series, makes the mansionof Nebiros the first. Curiously, considering that Sothis has precessed from this degree in more recenttimes, the mansion following is that of Astaroth; marking the GV hierarchy as up-to-dateastrologically.The Headless OneHEN ENCOUNTERED IN MEDICAL MAGIC the Headless Spirit is a fever demon. In other forms howeverthe Headless One is one of the most important spirits of our study. Massively important inthe magical papyri, Betz sees his origins as being in the earlier Egyptian religion, and noteshow he is equated in the papyri sometimes with Osiris and sometimes with Besas. My own research,now republished with some amendments as The Headless One, notes a further important andextensive linkage; with Typhon-Set. Much of the apparent confusion can be drastically reduced bytaking into account two factors. Firstly, this deity shares in the solar-pantheism of the period, and islinked to other deities as a cumulative effect of this tendency (see for example the ‘Ode to the Sun’where both Osiris and Typhon are viewed as solar). The other is his positive identification in varioustexts (Liber Sacer, Kyranides, Codex Cromwellianus &c.) with both the first decan and the firstlunar mansion of Capricorn. This is of course the zodiacal opposite of the first decan of Cancer,which in the ancient period was represented by Sothis. His association with Osiris may be as muchdue to this as the solar-pantheism, of which in any case the decans are a major expression.This second point is reinforced in various ways by the ancient literary evidence. PGM II.64–184 isa classic example of solar pantheism in the papyri and involves the Headless Spirit; it is given as analternative procedure of a preceding Apollonian invocation. Among its details is the drawing of ascarab at the entrance of the magician’s bedchamber. In isolation this is a curious detail and could beread in several ways. However the Headless Spirit in Liber Sacer is also ‘dressed’ with a scarab. InEgyptian astrological symbolism of the period the scarab substituted for the crab of Cancer. TheHeadless One as deity of Capricorn has an important relationship with Sothis; he is, so to speak,Osiris to her Isis.As is evident by now, Capricorn is one of the solsticial signs, which with the equinoctial signs formsthe cardinal grouping; with which the Four Kings and their counterparts are identified. The Capricornsolstice represents the Gate of the Gods in the eschatological soul travelling schema of the ancientstar lore concerned. As the matched pair of Sothis its importance precedes the Hellenisticastrological reworking; that is, Sothis and the Headless One enjoy traces of ancient seniority from thepre-Aries history of the decans. Echoes of this old school seniority can be felt in the high statusaccorded to Amaymon in the grimoires, and may be involved in his occasional shifts between Southand East."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"MAThe Root-Cutters meet the AstrologersAGICAL RINGS, in the words of Cornelius Agrippa, were always much esteemed of by theancients. His instructions provide us with a methodology for the text above, and illustrate therelevance to later grimoire magic of the technical Hermetica. The appropriate star ascendingand well aspected, for example to the Moon, the stone and herb associated with it are used in makinga ring. The root or other plant matter is placed beneath the stone in a space made for that purpose.Such a ring bears an image engraved on the stone as well as magical characters; appropriate incenseis also employed in the rite of consecration. This rite bears cross comparison with the theurgic ritualof conjunction. The ring substitutes for the circle, wherein a plant is ‘buried’ (under a stone) and amagical link is thus formed with a star daimon, forming a tacit pact. In the same way the theurgic ritereceives commentary back from the hermetic technicalities; when forming pacts with individual decanspirits by the raising up of plants, particular stones and plants are concerned. A potent and versatilemagical technology, involving material ingredients alongside spiritual agencies, is at workthroughout. Pythagoras and other later thinkers tended to idealise the root-cutters – see the partialunveiling of the relationship between chthonic cults and later spiritual movements in Geosophia.Simultaneously of course these later occultists imposed their own ideas retrospectively on theseimportant predecessors. The same process is inevitable but conscious in our recovery of archaicGoetia from its Neoplatonist vehicle. Certain themes and ideas are brought over with the archaiccore; some as welcome additions, providing useful structure, while also providing a valuableinterface with later celestial tradition that retains a shared inheritance from antiquity. There is alsoextraneous baggage, such as the thwarting angel paradigm in large part represents. Here ‘cutting backto the roots’ has metaphorical as well as practical and historical meaning.In the lore of the decans there is a major stratum of herb lore that undoubtedly reflects far moreancient practice independent of subsequent Greco-Chaldean astrology. So too the informed readerwill notice how many plants in the following list are famous in post-Classical Western magic. Theyare often associated with planets and signs in later texts, although Hermetic association with thedecans may well precede this Chaldean usage; the Egyptian contribution to Western occultism andherbalism alike makes this at least possible, even likely. Equally however in later lore we find thesame herbs in contexts where lunar tides, key festivals or pure expediency determine timing; whichmay well have been true of the root-cutters and others. Through all these changes the root-cutter’sarchaic plant alphabet is traceable – through consecutive and overlapping magical traditions or‘languages’ – from prehistory to the present day.The term root doctor is commonly employed in New World magic; a pleasing concatenation ofterms for practitioners widely separated in time whose pharmacopœia involves considerablecontinuity. The difficulty some critics have seen in uniting archaic Goetia with New World magic ismassively undermined by revealing these commonalities, whose importance in either context rarelyreceives the attention given Kabbalistic components in the post-Agrippa grimoires.Practical PointersS REGARDS LIBER SACER a few technical questions require investigation, most prominently the matterof the ring metal. The text appears to have lost details of which metal is required for most ofthe decans, to be replaced by what you wish after a few specific and explicable examples."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Aries 1 and 2, iron and gold respectively, point to a system of planetary attributions. Unfortunately thetwo main schemas both start the same way; the Chaldean Order and the Trigonal attribution bothcommence with Mars and the Sun, but continue quite differently. The Chaldean Order follows theorder of the planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon, beginning with Mars andrepeating as necessary. The Trigonal Order, erroneously thought to be of Oriental origin is just asHellenistic (LAG). This attributes the three decans of each sign to the planets ruling the elementaltriplicity; beginning with that ruling the individual sign. Thus again the first two decans are attributedto Mars and the Sun (rulers of Aries and Leo). Second and third Taurus both include references toring metal, gold in the first case, gold or silver in the second. Had it been the other way around thenthe Trigonal (Moon second decan Taurus) might be suggested. Finally the second decan of Leo isattributed to gold here, but both systems reference Jupiter. It is just possible that Leo’s defining star,Regulus, has influenced the choice of gold. In practice the reader must make their own decision;bearing in mind that attribution of planets and signs to the decans is a syncretic combination ofChaldean with Egyptian ideas, wherein they originally played no part.So too Agrippa’s methodology in astrological terms may well differ from the original. Apreliminary deciphering of Liber Sacer’s instructions in Hellenistic astrological terms is as follows.By horoscope is certainly meant the first house, where presumably the decan is rising. Good daimonis more ambiguous, indicating either the eleventh house or the Part of Daimon. By positionappropriate is surely intended a sign or decan ruling the part of the body, tautological as this might beas the text currently stands. Bringing these into good relation at the time of charging the ringrepresents the magical timing concerned."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE CORRESPONDENCESPrior to examining the stones and plants listed in Liber Sacer a few words are necessary concerningthese and other correspondences, their diffusion and various other points.

Inparticular, the employment of parchment and metal talismans in the grimoires is plainly a laterdevelopment. Arnold writes (CS 38): [Jewish] amulets were made out of a variety of objects, butmost often precious stones. Employment against demons and disease, often synonymous, werecommon, among other purposes. They might be engraved with the menorah or other cult object; thenames of patriarchs or of angels, Michael and Gabriel particularly; or magical characters and signs.Among the latter the resemblance of decan characters to the Jewish celestial writing (KoS 127) hasbeen noted elsewhere. So too, as Arnold notes, pagan names, figures, and symbols also appeared onJewish amulets. Similarly invocations of Helios, Aphrodite as evening star, and of Hermes and theMoon appear in the Sepher Ha-Razim, along with 36 angels of the first heaven likely to signify thedecans.The Plants"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"In commenting upon the attribution to the decans of plants (and indeed minerals) I do not intend togive a reconstructionist pharmacopoeia. Nevertheless some notes highlighting the connections of thisancient lore are hopefully of use. The magical traditions of ancient Europe had herbal magical loreroughly comparable to various better known folk magical traditions. These traditions persisted fromthe earliest times through various phases of philosophy and religion. Important as the followingmaterial is it is only fair to say that we cannot attribute to the early root cutters the doctrines of laterphilosophers who retrospectively idealised their traditions. It will however strike modern occultiststhat, even through the hermetic lens, these root cutters sound rather akin to root doctors in New Worldtraditions. This is not entirely surprising, influential as the Hermetic lore was upon the grimoires andbooks of secrets. At the same time it retains many characteristics from more remote antiquity, and weshould remember that it is folk tradition which the Hermetic philosophers – among others – werereinterpreting.Frequently one is struck by the recurrence in different order of the same herbs, stones and animalsto the fixed stars, mansions and decans, as given in various differing texts. A similar rule extends tothe planets, as also to the signs, although the animal set is much closer to the dodekaurus than thezodiac (Geo II.7 ‘The Magical Papyri’). Like pre-literate magical signs, animal, vegetable andmineral, they become involved with the ‘alphabet’ of astrology. This is not to say the archaic and thesyncretic ‘languages’ are merged at random. Rather that it is important that both languages are heard,while their harmony centres on particular agencies upon whom emphasis is subtly but consistentlymaintained.A representative set of such attributions can be found in several manuscripts, and mingled withothers throughout Agrippa (for example, the plants in TBOP I.32). These are essentially Hermeticalthough later attributions to Enoch, Solomon &c. are found. The earliest manuscripts are frequentlyArabic, but the imagery betrays Hellenistic origins. A planetary interpretation of the fixed stars(Venus/Sothis, Mars/Orion &c.) is also plain.

One of the oldest deities, Taurt, neverassumed humanoid form, but remained a composite beast. So too, it is likely – or useful toconceive – that the sacrificial animals of the Greek gods were their earlier non-anthropoid forms; forexample preceding Dionysus portrayed as a youth was the goat. The study of the animal symbolism ofboth mansions and decans is highly complex for this and other reasons.As with the herbs, while their distribution in various schemas is irregular, a consistent ‘alphabet’ ofanimal symbols is very apparent. As noted by Gundel, familial relations between the zoologicalimages of decans, mansions and dodekauros are close; the zodiacal images meanwhile are tangiblymore distant from all three than they are from each other. The origins of the mansions – which in myopinion most epitomise this form of symbolism – are uncertain, but given their lunar calendar is likelyChaldean. So too, perhaps, is the dodekauros with Greco-Egyptian participation or adaptation. Thissuggests that the development of mansion symbolism in relation to the decans followed neo-Chaldeanlines, which is not inherently unlikely. All were widespread in the Roman period, so that for instancea dodekauros/Olympian schema may be found in inscriptions and in much later lore.In Liber Sacer the majority of animal symbols are used differently from the stones and plants; theyrepresent a force antipathetic to the decan, which is to be avoided.

An integral part ofgoetic lore, I quote the description in TG:Heliotrope, or bloodstone, has a distinguished occult history ...

His necromancers are infact identical with the Magi, or Babylonian priest magicians mentioned by Pliny on the subjectof the same stone. In his account the magicians claimed that the stone heliotrope combined withthe plant of the same name conferred invisibility. In shamanic terms invisibility is the power tomove unimpeded in the world of spirits. Bloodstone was also believed to confer long life andfame.The Orphic Lithika associates hematite with the god Ouranos.Siderite From the Greek sideros meaning iron, siderite is likely identical with the mineral formed ofiron carbonate which now bears the name. It is a loose term, covering a variety of similar ores, butthe properties are similar.Bostrychitis This is a stone resembling braided hair according to Pliny. He cites Zoroaster as hissource, which implies a connection with magic of the period. This was likely iron alum (aka alun deplume, alunogen, feather alum or hair salt) or amianthus aka satin asbestos.TaurusSelenite A collective name for several forms of gypsum, called also satin spar, desert rose andgypsum flower. Albertus Magnus describes it as horned, which describes its mineral form adequatelyand likely explains the derivation from Selene the Moon (exalted in Taurus).Stone of Aphrodite The identity of this stone is uncertain at the time of writing.

Green jasper was among themost common types in antiquity.Euchaite This is probably the same as aetites or eagle stone mentioned by Albertus Magnus asechites.

Suchknowledge was thus well advanced in Greece throughout antiquity. The earliest practitioners ofmedicine in ancient Greece were known as root cutters, and they undoubtedly practiced magicalso (the Hymn to Demeter promises protection from their potions). Theophrastus, the father ofBotany, considered the root-cutters somewhat eccentric in their manner of collection of herbs androots. At the same time he was complimentary about their knowledge and legacy, including safemethods of extracting medicines from truly dangerous plants. These practitioners undoubtedlyunderpin the long history of Greek magic and medicine, disciplines considered inseparable for muchof mankind’s history.As has been shown in Liber Sacer, the use of roots and stones was simultaneously an offering aswell as involving sympathia. Such a process thus propitiates decan gods or spirits, whereas bindingsand ritual curses as in the Testament of Solomon do not. In my opinion the verbal and writtenformulæ accompanying the decans in the ToS indicate motion away from Hermetic herb lore, undercultural pressure. On the sole occasion in the ToS that detailed magical use of plants is mentioned thespirit responsible is told to shut up (vss. 31, 32.). In the period of synthesis, reluctance to makeofferings to entities other than the Supreme God may have led to an increase in verbal formulæ. Inother words the entire thwarting angel paradigm might be traced to wilful neglect of plants andstones! The reduction of such formulæ in more spirit friendly approaches therefore has self evidentimplications.AriesIsophryn Neither academics nor rare occult sources translate or comment upon this plant name. Isosmeans equal to, suggesting the plant of the same name as the stone could be intended (heliotrope, see1st decan stone).

Its importancehas led to it being called the European ginseng.This last plant brings us to an important point. Modern studies have thoroughly vindicatedchamomile’s role in ancient cultures whereas studies of verbena have so far been rather sparse. Suchneglect is in part due to the lack of botanists, biologists &c. among classical professors. Thus, throughspecialisation, academia consistently wastes a massive literary inheritance of classical medicinallore. In a not terribly dissimilar fashion, in the early stages of the Occult Revival neglect of hermeticlore resulted from early emphasis upon Qabalah and Masonic ritual; also the unavailability of thePGM, Liber Sacer and other works in English translation. This situation has had widespreadrepercussions, one of which deserves emphasis at this particular point of the present work.Appreciation of the affinities between the roots of Western magic and New World traditions has beendifficult, requiring special emphasis by authors such as Frisvold and myself. The importance of thestones, plants and animals in the above material is particularly relevant in this very respect;highlighting as it does the affinities between Western magic and Hoodoo, among other such traditions."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"AMAGICAL ANIMALSAn IntroductionS PREVIOUSLY SEEN, the decans began as gods, which is to say the earliest conception of them wasas deities of stars and constellations, and the earliest magical images of the decans took theform of Egyptian gods.The lunar mansions, on the other hand, began as animals. The Egyptian decan images are morerather than less bestial than other Egyptian deities. In contrast, the lunar mansions represent a majorsource of animal symbolism; subsequently transferred to the decans and elsewhere. Without making acomplex study more detailed still, the sources of these symbols may be briefly discussed. The sourceof the lunar mansions themselves is controversial, with advocates of Babylonian and Chinese originsamong others. An oral tradition among nomadic peoples might precede either one. That the mansionsare part of the Hellenistic synthesis regardless of origins is certain, as are some other aspects of theirdevelopment. It is clear enough that symbolism formerly proper to the lunar phases and the days of thelunar month was transferred to the mansions; one set of 28 being considered apt to another. Thusearlier Greek lunaria, lunar almanacs, are one source of such symbolism. Supposedly rustic Boeotiawas home to some of these traditions.Although Gundel deals primarily with the decans, aspects of mansion lore, including the animalsymbolism, were essential to his study. The animal alphabet he and Weinstock discuss is compared tothe zodiac and to the dodekaurus. It is with the latter that the lunar animal alphabet has most incommon. This alphabet was deeply influential, forming part of a major undercurrent in westernoccultism embodied by the long neglected lunar mansions. For example in the account of thingsconsidered lunary in Agrippa (TBOP I.xxiv) a major list of animal symbols occurs, in which appearbeasts, fish and fowl associated with the mansions, and indeed the decans as their derivative:Lunary Animals: all kinds of Dogs; the Chameleon; Swine, Hinds, Goats; Baboon; Panther; Cats;the Civet-Cat; Otters, and such as prey upon fish; Mice; Geese, Ducks, Didappers, all kinds ofwater fowl as prey upon fish, as the Heron; Wasps and Bees; small Flies and Beetles; but mostLunary of all is the two-horned Beetle, horned after the manner of a Bull: which digs under Cow-dung, and there remains for the space of twenty eight days, in which time the Moon measures thewhole Zodiac, and in the twenty ninth day, when it thinks there will be a conjunction of theirbrightness, it opens the dung and casts it into Water, from whence then come Beetles. Amongstfish these are Lunary, catfish [Bagre marinus]; the Tortoise, the Echeneis, Crabs, Oysters,Cockles, and Frogs.Having thus briefly introduced a complex subject, rather than develop historical tangents and variantlists from diverse cultures, it is better to approach things more useful to the general reader. There areessentially two aspects to be discussed from this perspective: parallel systems, and practicalapplications.In the PGM an important invocation of Hecate lists various correspondences, including 21 animalforms (including multiform) and seven other symbols: OX, vulture, bull, beetle, falcon, crab, dog,wolf, serpent, horse, she-goat, asp, kid, he-goat, baboon, cat, lion, leopard, field mouse, deer,polymorph, virgin, torch, lightning, garland, herald’s wand, child, key (PGM VII.756–94). It is areasonable assumption that seven animal symbols have been omitted in order to include the seven cult"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"symbols of Hecate at the end. Needless to say, Hecate in this context is a lunar goddess, and theanimal symbols also relate to her cult and divine forms. Such a proliferation of animal symbolssuggests a Mistress of Beasts, and the assimilation of Hecate to Artemis and Astaroth is implicit.Another Hecate invocation from the papyri in which seven further animal symbols occur enables areconstructed alphabet of 28 animal symbols. These additional symbols are: dragoness, mare, bitch,she-wolf, cow, camel, dove and sphinx (PGM IV.2302–2310). There are other sources for animalsymbols of the mansions that could further increase our total of animal symbols, but this is notnecessary. Restricting ourselves to the 20 symbols of the primary example instead makes a strongercase in the following comparative analysis.Lunar Animals from PGMOXWOLF*BABOON**VULTURESERPENT**CAT**Bull**HORSELION**SCARAB***SHE-GOAT***LEOPARD*FALCON**ASP (OR ROYAL URÆUS)FIELD MOUSE*CRAB*YOUNG HORNED GOAT*DEER***DOG***HE-GOAT*POLYMORPH ** indicates Dodekauros; * Agrippa’s Lunary Animals, *** bothThe Bull (3) rather than Ox (1) is an ancient symbol of divine power in the Middle East and relevantto Lucifer as the supreme power among the spirits; the crescent horns can mark his importance as thefirst lunar mansion. In the Grimoire of Honorius Lucifer is offered the humble mouse (19), recallingLucifer’s links with Apollo (Smintheus). The vulture (2) is an important Egyptian royal symbol, itswings representing the Upper and Lower kingdoms, while Maut (the vulture goddess) is one of theprincipal Great Goddess figures.As with the plant and stone alphabets, so here; the precise order of the ‘letters’ is of secondaryimportance. What matters is the retention of the individual symbols in the Great Synthesis; organisedaccording to the astrological principles that defined it. Indeed, there are several ways in which thesesymbols might be used in Moon magic. For example, rather than a list of 28 individual symbols, a setof seven repeated four times would be equally traditional and workable in practice. These might bedifferentiated by colour or elemental association, so that in each group of seven there was a cat of adifferent colour or element. Some ‘Moon magicians’ might even make do with the same animalsymbol throughout; a cat is always lunar regardless of mansion or lunar phase. As with the mineraland herbal lists, hermetic animal symbols of the planets and other astrological categories can bereferred back to the mansions. On this hypothesis a traditional planetary animal table can illustratewhat is said above in regard to the mansions:"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"PLANETARYANIMALMANSIONS ASMODEL SIGN DIVISIONSSaturnMoleCardinalJupiterDeer MarsWolf SunLionFixedVenusGoat MercuryApeMutableMoonCat Note that six out of seven of these animals appear in the list taken from the invocation of Hecate,illustrating that both derive from the same alphabet. To further illustrate these principles, bear in mindthat both zodiac and dodekaurus were anciently associated with the Olympic deities. Thus, employingthe animal symbols of the latter, Agrippa’s ‘Orphic Scale of the Number 12’ can be adapted as in thefollowing table. Again, the majority of these symbols can be found in the Hecate invocation. So toocertain features become clear, such as the appearance of male and female animals and birds, andoccasionally their young. Many such associations have a long history in relation to this or that deityand country of origin. It is very clear that some old symbols have been tweaked towards Egyptianequivalents; for instance the crab, the crayfish and the scarab beetle converge in many instances.The employment of animal symbols in magic has many aspects and precedents. The shamanic links,involving totems and transformations, are among the most important. It is important to encourageeffective magic by adaptation within our own environment, rather than simply imitate un-adaptedforms in an artificial way. Egyptian lore appears to preserve and adapt tribal magic within a partagricultural, part urbanised civilisation. This deserves our attention, whatever other attractions theculture may or may not have for us. For us, the prevalence of animal imagery in Egyptian lore enablescombination of archaic and primal features with more conventional and civilised ritual methods.The pure theriomorphs in Egyptian lore are often ambivalent, close to the demonic as understood inother cultures. There is no separate term for demons in Egyptian, but the more ambivalent deities andtheir retinues often possess wholly animalistic forms. Nevertheless there can be little doubt that thesemi-anthropomorphic deities evolved from earlier totems. Others however never evolved humanforms, such as the goddess Taurt; this did not place her among the ‘demons’ but underlined her primalpower. So too there are many examples of employing theriomorphic deities in protective roles; theseare the fighter demons, which resemble the hostile spirits but are employed against them. This isstrongly reminiscent of shamanic contests, where the shaman and his opponent transform into or sendanimal spirits. Incidentally the boundary between transformation into an animal, and the employmentof a spirit in animal form, is often extremely tenuous. The preference for one or the otherinterpretation is often regional, and rarely watertight.OLYMPICDODEKAUROSPARTIALBIRD & BEASTDEITYSYMBOLSECONDARYFROM ORPHIC (SEE PGM)LIST IN PGMTABLE"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Athene CatMonkey (Ape)Owl, She-goatAphrodite DogUnicornDove, He-goatApollo SnakeCatCock, BullHermes Scarab(Crayfish)BullIbis, DogZeus AssLionEagle, StagDemeter LionAssSparrow, SowHephæstus GoatCrayfishGoose, AssAres Bull Magpie, WolfArtemis FalconIbisJackdaw, HindDionysus Baboon (Ape) Heron, LionHera Ibis Peacock, SheepPoseidon Crocodile Swan, HorseThis brings us fairly naturally to the concept of assumption of beast-forms; essentially a more primalapplication of the 19th century occultists’ assumption of god-forms. Unlike the use of Egyptian godsas models for astral transformation, this approach requires no specific precedent for the employmentof this or that animal. That is, the magician may employ any appropriate animal form; semi-anthropomorphic and ‘traditional’ Egyptian or not as the case may be. Some of the creatures namedabove will naturally suggest an Egyptian deity, others will not. Either way the creature may beemployed magically; with spirits appearing in that form, or the magician assuming that shape.Tolley’s study of shamanism is extremely enlightening as regards animals. His identification of ananimal mother (Vol. 1, 203) is reminiscent of the Mistress of Beasts (Potnia Theron) in Greek lore.Given that some features of shamanism are – so to speak – generic, other aspects of his study areequally important. A shamanic interpretation suggests lines of descent for our animal alphabets. Heidentifies animal attendant spirits of three main types: birds, fish and beasts (especially, but for ourpurposes not exclusively, the reindeer).In shamanic lore the bird forms are often considered most powerful. As well as permittingmovement and other powers – such as fighting – they permit the shaman to visit the sky god or otherpowerful intercessor. Land animals are intermediate, they are also important for movement andfighting, and connect with hunting magic. Some beasts represent the object of the hunt (reindeer mayalso be farmed); others – like the bear – represent powerful gods or ancestral figures. The aquaticcreatures, including but not limited to fish, represent the power of visiting the Underworld. Thus theshaman’s power is defined by the animal spirits with which they are able or unable to work.ELECTED ANIMAL SYMBOLSIt is impossible to be exhaustive on the subject of magical animals; let alone cover them adequately inrelation to spirits, the dead and the Moon. A select few are mentioned here, mainly to highlight"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"interpretative issues.The Horse is an important magical animal, arising several times in the course of this study withoutbeing sought. A magical horse as an ally of a shaman enables travel in the spirit world, and is a markof rare power. Horse skulls are not uncommon protective devices in old British buildings, and thewater horse or kelpie is an important folklore figure with whom we will later become betteracquainted. That these two powerful motifs occupy the same geographical area may imply a degree ofkinship at a very early date. The pre-classical precedents of mare-headed Demeter – and the earlychthonic Poseidon with whom she was paired – underline the chthonian implications (Geo) ratherthan explaining folklore parallels with no apparent linkage. There is no leap to comprehending thehorse in Chaldean Oracles 198 in mythic and magical terms. Through Vodou terminology a horse canalso represent the relationship between spirit and human in states of possession. Transformation intoa horse is suggested by various folk motifs, both old and revived. Note well that while aspects of thesymbol may originate in different cultures, they are common currency and likely to influence eachother, something practitioners should welcome without attaching historical assumptions in theprocess.Frog and Toad are related symbols, positive and negative poles of the same conception. For ourpurposes the root idea is a perceived resemblance to a human being (as in the Cyprian grimoires, seePart 5). The toad then is a diabolical reflex of the same symbolism. Some flexibility is required tomanage the potential meaning of one or the other, allowing for the tendency of formerly positivesymbols to slip into their negative reflex; for recuperation by adoption of the supposed negative.The Cat is a classic lunar symbol as well as an emblem of witchcraft. There are a variety of spells inwhich the cat features which. while not encouraged, underline the importance of the symbol. TheRoman goddess Diana, a cognate of Artemis, Hecate and other goddesses of the Moon and of magic,could take on the guise of a cat. All in all the symbolism of the cat is very extensive and does notrequire much underlining here. In Part 5 the occurrence of the cat in Cyprianic iconography isdiscussed along with the toad and bat.The Bird and the Bat, as a polarised pair, at a simple level much of the symbolism is here duplicatedin positive and negative modes, like the frog and toad. Considered separately the bat is by no meansalways a negative symbol and birds are far from uniformly positive. As with the frog and toad it alsopays to be alert to the likelihood of inversion of a positive symbol into a negative equivalent, andvice versa. Wings of the bird or bat are also found attached to other creatures, such as the horse orserpent; transferring the avian symbolism and heightening its power.Serpent, Dragon and Crocodile share many characteristics, and are in large degree interchangeable.The snake, viper or asp is an important symbol, but it is not a dragon, while a serpent or great wormmost definitely is. For various reasons, a hippopotamus is a potential dragon, but it will never be acobra. Possession of legs or wings is not required, but they do not exclude a creature from theDraconic genus.Thus in the syncretism of the Great Synthesis, as seen already, Egyptian forms could be substituted forGreek and vice versa; scarab for crab, crocodile for serpent and so forth. How much or how little ofolder contexts of individual symbols is to be assumed when collated into syncretic alphabets is a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"difficult point to summarise.
