Additional 3544 is a text in transition, which stands at the boundary between medieval ‘clerical necromancy’ and a developing ‘composite’ magic, characteristic of the sixteenth century, which drew on a much greater variety of traditions than before.As Richard Kieckhefer observed of another book of necromancy, ‘the text is neither edifying nor profound, nor is it particularly original’.3 However, the text presented here is worthy of publication because it is more than just working notes made by a practising necromancer. FT presents itself as a complete treatise on the art of necromancy and, as such, it offers a snapshot of ritual magic as practised m England at a critical historical moment: the dissolution of the monasteries and the beginning of England’s long and complex Reformation. The dissolution represented the destruction of one of the environments most conducive to the safe practice of learned magic, as Sophie Page has recently demonstrated in her study of manuscripts of magic at1 Cambridge University Library’s electronic catalogue can be found at http://janm.lib.cam.ac.uk.2 Only 22 known British texts of ritual magic survive from the sixteenth century (Klaassen, F., The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and Renaissance (University' Park, РЛ: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2013), p, 159). For a list of surviving sixteenth-century ritual magic texts see Klaassen, F., ‘Medieval Ritual Magic in the Renaissance’, Aries 3 (2003), pp. 166-99, at p. 197.3 Kieckhefer. R., Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer s Manual of the Fifteenth Century (Stroud: Sutton, 1997), p. 3."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PR 12St Augustine’s, Canterbury. Many of these manuscripts remained in the library at St Augustine’s until its dissolution in 1538.4 FT, which was probably composed between 1532 and 1539, embodies the final phase of medieval 'clerical magic’ in England, and it could have originated in a monastic context. The emergence of learned magic from the protection of the cloister after 1539 led ultimately to a drive towards a more purified, ‘Protestant5 magic, as well as the diffusion of learned magical techniques to a wider (and less educated) group of practitioners.The manuscriptThe original manuscript book on which this text is based consists of 174 pages in total,5 two of which have been tom out (pp. 54 and 55). Of the remaining pages of the manuscript, 140 bear some sort of text or illustration. The manuscript contains three distinct texts, each of which seems to have been written by a different owner, and with no connection to the others except the fact that they are all magical texts. By far the longest of these, the Latin and English text reproduced in this volume, is called here the Foreman Text because it bears the personal name ‘paul foreman’ on the third folio. FT runs to 122 pages (minus pp. 54 and 55, but including the three-page contents list on pp. 165-7). The second text is a short exorcism in English which bears the personal name £J. Caistcrson’ at the top of p. 120 and is just two pages long (pp. 120-1). The third text, also in English, has no personal name associated with it and covers pp. 154-66. Additional 3544, like many books of magic, was a notebook that passed through multiple owners, several of them magical practitioners. However, based on internal evidence, there can be no doubt that FT was the earliest text to occupy the pages of the manuscript book that is now Additional 3544.Additional 3544 is modest in size, measuring 19 by 14.5cm, and is written on paper rather than parchment or vellum. It was originally wrapped in a vellum cover made from a reused leaf of a medieval gradual, now Cambridge University Library7 MS Additional 4435(17). The book’s small size is typical of magical books of the period, which were often small enough to be hidden easily, and the vellum cover may have served to disguise from the casual observer what the book really was. Little is known of the manuscript’s provenance, except that it was purchased by Cambridge University Library in January 1899 from the bookseller Sydney V. Galloway. At the time, Galloway was based m Pier Street, Aberystwyth. In 1902 he moved to Cambridge and. with Charles Porter, established the bookshop Galloway and Porter in Sidney Street.1 Page, S., Magic in the Cloister: Pious Motives, Illicit Interests and Occult Approaches io the Medieval Universe (University Park, РЛ: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2013), p. 4.5 The verso and recto of each folio in Additional 3544 is numbered (in imitation of a printed book), so I refer to the MS by page rather than folio.xii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PR13Additional 3544 was purchased from Galloway by the University Library' at the same time as the papers of the antiquary Sir Richard Colt Iloare (1758-1838), now MSS Additional 3545-55, but there seems to be no connection between these items and the book of magic. FT concludes on p. 119, but the margins are carefully drawn out and pricked up to p. 125. The ‘Caisterson’ text on pp 120-1 therefore follows on directly from the mam treatise, suggesting that it might have been composed by an apprentice or direct successor of the author of FT. The third treatise, on pp. 154-66, seems to represent a later re-use of the empty pages of the earlier manuscript book, and it is likely that it was composed by a subsequent owner.FT stands apart from the other two texts in Additional 3544 because its author made an effort to give the text both unity of structure and an aesthetically pleasing appearance, carefully drawing and pricking the margins and writing in page numbers. He began the book with a decorated initial ‘A’, and many of the Latin sections of the book arc written in gothic script, as if for presentation. The book thus mimics both contemporary printed books and the illuminated manuscripts of an earlier era. Frank Klaassen has observed that the ‘self-conscious production of a book that looks magical’ was a new development in the sixteenth century. By way of comparison, the scribe of British Library MS Sloane 3847, which is probably a little later than FT, made use of black letter gothic and created a ‘mock frontispiece’,6 *In the sixteenth century, the use of the vernacular became ever more common in texts of ritual magic/ In FT, the vernacular sections of the manuscript account for a little over a quarter (27%) of the entire text. In some cases, it is clear why English has been used: the exorcisms and conjurations to be pronounced by the boy or girl acting as a scryer needed to be in English, because a child would be less likclv to know Latin. In other eases, the use ofjEnglish rather than Latin may simply be down to the fact that the author was copying from a manuscript in English. F Ts use of English is most prominent in the first half of the text, and later tails off, suggesting that the author may have been making more extensive use of an English source manuscript (or manuscripts) for the divinatory experiments that are prominent in the first half of the text.Like some printed texts of the time, FT is paginated rather than foliated, and the author makes use of different scripts for Latin and English (although this may owe as much to earlier manuscript traditions). Clear evidence of the influence of print is discernible in FT’s orthography, which shows the impact of humanist studies by the 1530s. Although the author usually uses conventional late medieval Latin orthography, such as e for Classical Latin ae, there are three occasions when he uses the Classical spelling: dampnationis eternae [62a], aererum purissimum [72a] and haec nomina [89a], In [72a] he is quoting directly from the 1532 edition of Amald of Villanova’s Opera, which strongly suggests that his use of novel6 Klaassen (2013), p. 162.Ibid. pp. 174-5.xiii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PR 14orthographic conventions came from reading printed texts. Furthermore, the author’s familiarity with Hebrew seems to have improved during the composition of the text. lie twice attempts to write the name of God in Hebrew, at [15J] and [62a] Whilst the name at [15j] is barely recognisable as Hebrew', [62a] has a competent rendering of the characters. This may mean that the author encountered a printed text featuring Hebrew characters, or simply that he wras copying from the manuscript of a more competent HebraistDating the textCambridge University Library’s catalogue dates Additional 3544 to around 1560, presumably on the basis of palaeographical evidence alone. This date, however, is too late, and the manuscript (or at least the earliest part of it, FT) can be dated more precisely on the basis of internal evidence. The clearest instance of this is the author’s sole reference to a printed book in the description of one of the sigils of Arnald of Villanova [72]. ‘... the hole xij [sigils] which you shall fynd in A boke of phisycke which ys emprinted: Arnoldus de villa nova: folio: 302:’ The reference is to Arnald of Villanova’s treatise De sigillis, which first appeared in print in 1504.8 However, the author’s reference to a numbered folio allows the edition of Arnald’s De sigillis to be identified more precisely as the 1532 edition of Arnald‘s Opera, published at Lyons by Seipio de Gabiano.9 It is certain, therefore, that the manuscript was compiled after 1532.If the terminus post quern of FT is 1532, its likely terminus ante quern is 1558. In the ‘Precept of the spirits’ [66| (pp. 21-2), part of ‘An experiment to call the spirit Mosacus’, wre find the words:I Coniure you sprytts in the verityc of our lord Jesu Chryste ... that thou brynge & delyuer me A [illeg.) of gold & fylnes of Englyshe money good & 1 awful 1 wbersoever they shalbe, in our custodye within the lands of Inglande Ireland wales & fraunee beynge hyd or lostc which rychcs ar not to the use of any Crystyan man lyuynge in England or Ireland wales or ffraunce.The inclusion of France alongside England, Ireland and Wales as places where ‘English money good and lawful’ could be found is a strong indication that the text wras written before the fall of Calais to the French on 7 January 1558, the last fragment of England's Angevin empire. However, a date of composition as late as the 1550s seems unlikely. The formula is also notable for including an explicit mention of Wales alongside England, a form of words that had no legal justification after the Law's in Wales Acts of 1536о . „On the print history' ot Arnald’s De sigillis see Vescovini, G. F,, T sigilli eossidetli Arnaldiani’, Traditio 60 (2005), pp. 201^12.9 Arnald ot Villanova, Opera nuperrime revisa, cum ipsius vita recenter hie apposita (Lyons, 1532), fols 301v-302r,xiv"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PR 15and 1543 formally incorporated the Principality and Marches of Wales into the Kingdom of England. Magical texts are often conservative, and the author may have been copying an earlier text, but the formula in question is also explicitly legalistic: the operator is attempting to ensure that the spirits have no loophole that will allow them to bring him false or illusory money.The strong emphasis on the mass throughout the text makes a date of composition between 1549 and 1553 (the reign of Edward VI) highly unlikely, since during this period the English Prayer Book replaced the Latin mass. The complacent religiosity of the text also makes it unlikely that it was written during Man' Es restoration of Catholicism in 1553-58, when the Counter- Reformation clergy took a dim view of the sort of excessive ‘superstition’ that was blamed for the Reformation in the first place. The most likely window for the composition of the text is the last fifteen years of the reign of Henry VIII. A date of composition in or after 1536 is suggested by the fact that the original cover of Additional 3544 was a vellum leaf from a late medieval gradual, containing a four-line plainchant with simple initial letters in blue (MS Additional 4435(17)).The main surviving part of this cover is discoloured from long use as an outer protection of the manuscript, but the liturgy for the Feast of the Conversion of St Paul (on 25 January) is still visible. Another smaller fragment of the cover bears the words of the intro it for the commemoration of more than one confessor, Sacerdotes del benedicite dewn sancti et humiles corde laudate deum (‘Priests of God, bless God; those who are holy and humble of heart, praise God’). It seems unlikely that a leaf from a gradual would have been used in this way before 1536. when the lesser religious houses were dissolved and their libraries dispersed The dispersal of medieval texts on vellum de-sacralised them; it is rather ironic, therefore, that a book whose supernatural power was destroyed by the Reformation served as a binding for a paper book with its own pretensions to supernatural power.Further dispersals of medieval manuscripts occurred in 1539, when the libraries of the great religious houses were scattered, and there was yet another dispersal of medieval manuscripts in 1552 when the parish churches were forced to give up their remaining liturgical books.10 Additional 4435(17) could have become the cover of Additional 3544 at any of these dates, or indeed long afterwards: medieval manuscript leaves were re-used multiple times in the early modem period.11 Lillie can be deduced about the gradual’s origin from the surviving leaves. In pencil notes on the outer folder containing Additional 4435(17), the original cataloguer of the manuscript concluded that the gradual was not of the Sarum use. This would make it fairly unusual in England: by the beginning of the sixteenth century most cathedrals,10 Parishioners were given the opportunity to bid for ‘hundredweights of outlawed parchment books’ (Duffy, E.. Saints, Sacrilege and Sedition: Religion and Conflict in the Tudor Reformations (London: Bloomsbury. 2012), p. 122.11 On early modern use and re-use of medieval manuscripts see Summit, J., Memory’s Library: Medieval Books in Early Modern England (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2008).XV"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PR 16Benedictine religious houses and parish churches in England had gone over to the Sarum usage, apart from the cathedrals of York, Hereford, London (St Paul’s) and Lincoln, The religious orders also continued to use their own gradual s until the dissolution.In 1542 an Act of Parliament introduced harsh penalties for using magic for many of the purposes in FT, such as treasure-hunting, thief detection and harming others.12 13 One experiment in FT [59f| makes a reference to the protection offered by the herb valerian if the magician is brought in Judicio ante Reges & Basilides Judices & prelatos (‘in judgement before kings and emperors, judges and prelates’). Before 1542, it was extremely unlikely that a magician would be brought before a judge (or indeed the king), since no form of magic (other than attempted treason by magic) was a felony before that date. For prelatos to appear last in the list before 1542 might seem odd, given that necromancy was then an exclusively ecclesiastical offence in England. However, judices might also mean ecclesiastical judges in consistory courts. It is important nol to place too much evidential weight on the precise words of formulae in a book of magic, since the genre was inherently conservative and archaic formulae might he reused even if they had lost their relevance.Overall, the most likely period for the composition of FT is the three years between 1536 and 1539, after the dissolution of the lesser religious houses (hence the re-use of a leaf from a gradual) but before the impact of Henry VIII’s Reformation had really been felt. A form of conjuration [6ul [per] omnes reliques sanctorum & sanctorum (‘by all the relics of male saints and female saints’) strongly suggests that the text predates 1539, when reliquaries were confiscated, shrines destroyed and the vast majority of relics dispersed. The author of Additional 3544 shows little or no awareness that the religious world in which his particular kind of clerical magic was located stood on the brink of oblivion, and it seems difficult to imagine this kmd of complacency after the dissolution in 1539. However, it remains possible that the author was a self-conscious religious conservative.Faul ForemanThe name ‘paul foreman’ appears at the top of the third folio of Additional 3544, apparently in the same secretary hand as the English passages of the book. The signature is certainly sixteenth-century in dale. There is no proof that Paul Foreman was the author of FT, and he may simply have been an owner of the manuscript who wrote his name inside. However, it seems a curious coincidence that the gradual leaf re-used as a cover for the manuscript contains the liturgy for one of the feasts of St Paul. It is possible that Paul12 Pfaff, R. W. The Liturgy in Medieval England: A History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp, 445-508.13 The full text of the act may be found in Rosen, B. (ed.). Witchcraft in England, 1558-1618 (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press. 1991). pp. 53- 4.xvi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PR 17Foreman, if he was the author, chose this leaf deliberately as a play on his own Christian name.The appearance of the surname ‘Foreman’ immediately brings to mind one of the best known magical practitioners of early modern England, Simon Forman (1552-1611). Simon Forman was one of the foremost astrological physicians of late Elizabethan and Jacobean London, and his voluminous diaries and casenotes still survive. Simon Forman and Paul Foreman (if he was the author of Additional 3544) shared an interest in astral magic,14 but there is no chance that Simon Forman was the author of Additional 3544. We have numerous examples of Simon Forman’s handwriting, and the hand in FT is clearly not his.15 Furthermore, Simon Forman explicitly denounced demonic magic or necromancy,16 * which is the primary content of Additional 3544, and saw himself as a Renaissance magus. Paul Foreman, if he was indeed the author of Additional 3544, may have made occasional use of elements drawn from the ‘new’ Renaissance magic, but his learning was still resolutely rooted in the medieval world of forbidden clerical necromancy. In any case, Simon Forman was not even bom at the tune when FT is most likely to have been composed.It is fairly certain that the author of FT was not a priest, in spite of the overtly ‘clerical’ character of the magic as a whole, lie consistently uses formulae such as fac cantare missam (‘have a mass sung’), and never canta missam (‘sing a mass’). However, the author’s Latin is generally consistent and displays both a good standard of learning and detailed knowledge of the liturgy, and it is difficult to imagine that he was not a cleric of some sort. It is possible, given his ownership of a printed book on medicine, that he was a physician, but the timeframe within which the book was compiled, after 1532 and before 1558, makes it most likely that the author (whether Paul Foreman or not) was a current or former monk or friar, not in priest’s orders, who had received the benefit of a monastic education (albeit not necessarily at university).Late medieval English monasteries were considerable depositaries of magical texts,1' and knowledge of magic was also a resource that a monk or friar pensioned off after the dissolution could make use of as the basis of a subsequent career. The contents of Additional 3544, with its strong emphasis on thief detection and love magic (as well as occasional magieo-medical remedies for physical ailments) are consistent with the work of a cunning- man: someone who lived by magic, rather than a mere dabbler in14 Kassell, L.

One possible explanation of the mixture of learned necromancyand simple ‘recipes’ in Additional 3544 is that the manuscript represents ancx-monk or cx-friar learned in literary magic trying to deploy his knowledgeas a cunning-man, although this must remain speculation.The cataloguer of Additional 3544 suggested that the hands that appear at pp. 79-81 and pp. 120-1 are the same, and noted a resemblance to the hand of ‘Robert Greene de Welbe’, who transcribed Cambridge University Library Ff.4.12 and Ff 4 13. These are two volumes of a collection of alchemical treatises,* 19 20 21 and were acquired by Cambridge University from the personal library of Richard Holdsworth (d. 1649). Holdsworth, a graduate of St John’s College, had a distinguished academic career as Professor of Divinity at Gresham College and later as Vice-Chancellor at Cambridge in 1642-3.\" Owing to legal issues, the University did not finally acquire his library until 1665. If the hand is indeed the same, then the possibility' arises that Additional 3544 was an item originally in Holds worth’s collection that, for some reason, did not make its way to the University in 1665This hypothesis of the manuscript’s origin seems very unlikely. From a closer examination of FT, it is evident that the hands at pp. 79-81 and pp. 120-1 are not the same: the hand at pp. 120-1 is that of ‘J. Caisterson’, who signs his name at the top of p. 120, whereas p. 79 represents Paul Foreman experimenting with an italic hand. lie later reverts to the familiar gothic hand, and alternates between gothic and italic for the remainder of the text - it is almost as though the scribe was tom between the aesthetic appeal of gothic script and the faster, less cumbersome italic. Neither hand bears any real resemblance to the eccentric hand of Ff.4.12 and Ff 4 13 The cataloguer may have assumed that some connection existed between the manuscripts just because they were of an ‘occult’ nature. Overall, there seems little hope of recovering the identity of Paul Foreman or determining for certain whether or not he was the author of Additional 3544.\"1 The most it is possible to do is draw general conclusions about the context of the manuscript’s production in the England of the 1530s or ’40s.ls At least one experiment [82h] implies the magie is being performed on behalf of a client: Coniuro te spiritum Enoy ... vt demon stres michi sine nobis apte cpti huius hominis bona furatus est & locum in quo veraciter invenire potent (T conjure you, spirit Enoy ... that you should show me or us suitably which possession of this man was stolen and the place in which it may truly be found’).19 Oates, A.

P. G. Maxwell-Stuart has described this process as the ‘politicisation of magic’,'\" and it represented the beginning of a ‘confessionalisation’ of accusations of magic that would continue into the reign of Elizabeth. Magic was just one of a plethora of accusations of bad behaviour levelled against the clergy in order to justify the confiscation of church property in the early Reformation, and thereafter it remained a cause for suspicion. In the reign of Elizabeth, magic was repeatedly associated with Catholic malcontents dissatisfied with the Protestant religious settlement after 1559.In 1536 an informant named Richard Branktre made numerous accusations against William Love, the Cistercian Abbot of Coggcshall in Essex. These included reading anti-royal prophecies, administering abortifacienl drugs, homosexuality or pederasty and locating lost objects by magic.\"' The year 1536 saw the dissolution of the smaller religious houses, including the Cistercian abbey at Coggeshall, and allegations of bad behaviour against abbots and priors were enthusiastically collected by Henry VIII's Lord Privy Seal, Thomas Cromwell. Henry VIII’s government increasingly viewed religious conservatives as being capable of any form of religious deviance, including magic. The connection between magic and clerical disobedience was confirmed by cases like that of Sir William Richardson, a priest who celebrated the Least of St Thomas Becket on 1 July 1537, in defiance of royal edict. Richardson had previously been accused of sorcery, but escaped justice because Lady Lisle had interceded for him, and she now promised to do the same again.22 * 24On 30 July 1537 James May how of Rochester, Robert Hogekyn of Flushing and Arnold Hopkin of Sittingboume met with an English priest living in the Low Countries named Doctor Clene, who was otherwise known as ‘Sir John Skarme’, 'because he can cumber the devil as is said’. This was a reference to the popular but unofficial English saint ‘Sir John Schornc’, who was supposed to have confined the devil in a boot.25 Clene told his visitors that he had used a crystal to see whether the leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace22 Maxwell-Stuart.

The belief that Henry's favourites, Wolsey and Cromwell, were only able to achieve what they did by magic rings seems to have been widespread.2 A magical ring was part of the magical dealings of Sir William Neville, the brother of John Neville, Lord Latimer. Sir William consulted two magicians, Richard Jones and William Wade, to predict his future and provide him with various magical paraphernalia, including a cloak of invisibility. The magicians predicted that Neville would become Earl of Warwick and were tempted into ever more rash prophecies, eventually declaring that Henry’s reign would end in 1533 and that Neville would organise the subsequent succession to the throne.\"Neville asked Jones to make him a magical ring like the one that Cardinal Wolsey was supposed to have possessed, That whatsoever he asked of the king’s grace, that he had’. Neville thought that Cromwell had also consulted ‘one that was seen in your faculty’ (i.e. magic). When he was later questioned about this allegation, Jones admitted that T showed him that I had read many books, and specially the works of Solomon, and how this ring should be made, and of what metal; and what virtues they had after the canon of Solomon’.- However, Jones denied having actually made the ring.One group especially suspected of magic and defying the government in the 1530s were friars. There were a number of separate orders of friars in England in the 1530s, who included the Blackfnars (Domimcans), the Greyfriars (Franciscans), Observant Friars and Whhefriars (Carmelites).26 * 28 * 30 In 1535 Cromwell commissioned an agent named Gervase Tyndall to investigate a group of friars who were suspected of necromantic activities, which may have been aimed at undermining the state.31 When, in June 1535, a government informant named Jasper Fyloll ‘stopped at the Black Friars here of London, friar Dr Maydland said he would like to see the head of even1 maintainer of the new learning upon a stake ... and to see the king die a “violent and shameful” death; also, “to see that mischievous whore the queen26 Letters and Papers, vol. 13:1, 1383.2 Wolsey was supposed to have inflicted a troublesome spirit on the Duke of Norfolk by means of magic (Maxwell-Stuart (2014), pp. 99-100).28 Elton (1972), pp. 50-5.\"9 Kittredge.

According to Fyloll’s account, Maydland declared that ‘he knew by his science of necromancy that the new learning should be suppressed, and the old restored by the king's enemies from beyond the sea’.32 Maydland’s prophecy was probably a reference to the widespread belief that the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V would intervene in England and overthrow HenryIf FT was composed between 1532 and 1539, as seems likely, its author cannot have been unaware that, in addition to risking the usual ecclesiastical censures for dabbling in forbidden arts, he was also risking the wrath of a government that associated clerical magic with religious conservatism and resistance to Henry'. Writing a book of necromantic magic was potentially a political act. This fact became even clearer after the accession of Elizabeth. Just days after the new Queen came to the throne, on 17 November 1558, pursuivants sent by the Privy Council swooped on the Spanish ambassador’s house and arrested Anthony Fortcscuc, John Prestall and Thomas Kele for ‘conjuring’.33The magical dealings of papists continued into the 1560s. On 14 April 1561 an ex-monk called John Coxe. otherwise known as Devon, was arrested by customs officers at the port of Gravesend, in the Thames estuary, whilst trying to find a ship that would take him to the Spanish Netherlands. When Coxe was searched, he was found to be carrying letters to Catholic exiles living m the Low Countries. However, he also confessed to saying mass as part of love magic. The Privy Council commissioned John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, to go into Essex, where he was one of the leading magnates and the Lord Lieutenant of the county, ‘to enquire for mass mongers, and conjurers’.34 Oxford’s men searched the homes of Sir Edward Waldegrave at Borlev and Sir Thomas Wharton at Beaulieu (or New Hall). On 28 April the Spanish Ambassador to England, Alvaro de la Quadra, wrote to Margaret of Austria thatThey have also arrested six or eight very honoured clergymen, two of whom are Oxford doctors, and made it public that they are necromancers and that they have conjured demons to have the Queen37‘ Letters and Papers, vol. 9, 846,33 Ads of the Privy Council of England (London: HMSO, 1890—1974), vol. 7, pp. 5, 7, 22; Рапу.

The nine were pilloried at Westminster on the same day, and again at Cheapside on 25 June for their involvement in ‘conjuring and other matter’.' The magicians were Francis Coxe, an innkeeper named Hugh Draper, the priests John Coxe and Leonard Bilson, an ironmonger named Robert Man, a miller from Fakenham in Suffolk named Rudolf Poyntell, a cleric from Hamington in Worcestershire named John Cockoyter, a Clerkenwell salter named Fabian Withers and the Westminster goldsmith John Wright.35 36 37 In a later examination before Star Chamber on 20 June, John Coxe confessed to saying mass at Leonard Bilson’s home, ‘for hallowing of certain conjurations to those of the said Bilson who practised by those means to obtain the love of my Lady Cotton, the late wife of Sn Richard Cotton, Knight’;38 or, as another source put it, ‘Bilson ... to have his will of the Lady Cotton caused young Coxe a priest to say a mass to call on the devil to make her his lady’.39Francis Coxe, who appeared in the pillory' alongside John Coxe, Leonard Bilson and the other six, capitalised on his punishment by publishing a short broadside in which he confessed his crimes yet whetted the public’s appetite for a more extensive description of the sorcerer’s art. Accordmgly, in 1562 Coxe brought out a book entitled A Short Treatise declaring the Detestable Wickedness of Magical Sciences, as Necromancy, Conjurations of Spirits, Curious Astrology and such like, which conveniently portrayed him as a penitent sinner and earned him money at the same time. Here Coxe explained that one method used by magicians to gam power was to take a magical vow to abstain from certain foods:... besides the horrible and grievous blasphemies they commit in their conjurations, they must fall to some composition with the devil, that is to promise him for his service, he will abstain from wines, or some certain meats, or drinks.

However, Coxe’s short book is unusual, insofar as it w'as written by a practising (or ex-practising) magician, rather than by an opponent of magic. As such it offers important insights into the traditional, clerical necromancy that was still being practised in Elizabethan England but belonged to an earlier Catholic world. It is to that world that FT belongs.Most sixteenth-century manuscripts of magic remain unedited and unpublished, perhaps because the majority of them, like Additional 3544, are dominated by liturgical conjuration. This is a style of magic that has attracted less academic attention than Solomonic magic and Renaissance theurgy, perhaps because it is perceived as a hangover of the medieval period. However, liturgical demon conjuring is every bit as typical of early modern magic. Copiers of Solomonic magical texts like the Sepher Raziel sought to return to a purified form of conjuration drawn from Kabbalistic Jewish traditions supposedly passed down from Solomon himself, at a time when Renaissance humanists were interested in recovering the Kabbalistic tradition.40 Don Karr and Stephen Skinner have edited an English manuscript40 On Hebraism in Tudor England see Lloyd Jones, G., The Discovery of Hebrew in Tudor England: A Third Language (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 198.3); Glaser.

Deborah Ilarkness cited [8] ‘The working with the crystal stone' (pp. 26-30) and [11] ‘A perfect experiment of a glass or mirror’ (pp. 33-40) as evidence that scryers could use a variety of objects other than a crystal ‘shewstone’ like John Dee’s.41 42 On the other hand, Klaassen has recognised the more conservative nature of Additional 3544, using it as evidence that ‘experiments for love' continued to predominate in early modem magic.43 Additional 3544 represents a typical ‘dominant interest ... in ritual magic’.44 Typical it may be, but FT still has some interesting and distinctive features.Purposes of the magicFT contains a total of 91 ‘experiments' for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the extremely elaborate to the astonishingly simple.

The author lists experiments thematically rather than chronologically and uses different titles for the experiments in the table of contents compared to the text itself; as a result, there are only 82 entries in the table of contents. Furthermore, two of the experiments included in the original table of contents (for removing spirits guarding treasure) are now wholly or partially missing.

By far the longest experiments are those dedicated to divination, such as ‘An experiment of Mosacus’ [6J. Divinatory magic overlapped considerably with thief detection magic, which used exactly the same methods (a combination of spirit conjuration and serving with an assistant, usually a child). The main difference between the two was that the purposes of divinatory magic were less clearly stated: in the divinatory experiments, the spirits can tell the practitioner whatever he wants, rather than just information about thefts.The miscellaneous magic that fits into no particular category includes experiments to open wrax seals unnoticed and to ensure an inexhaustible supply of money, an experiment to raise up armed men, another to detect fraud and one to ensure a win at dice. The small number of ‘magieo-medical' experiments deal with such matters as toothache and fevers, and they are not sufficiently numerous or prominent in the text to suggest that the author45 This supports Klaassen's observation that ‘experiments for love’ are the most common in magical manuscripts, followed by procedures for thief detection (Klaassen (2007), p. 63).xxv"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"regarded himself as a medical practitioner. Indeed, the only experiment borrowed directly from a ‘book of physic’ and drawn directly from the tradition of medical image magic is ‘The sigils of Master Arnold’ |72], The category of ‘justice-related magic’ includes experiments to allow the magician to escape from prison [38, 68] or to sway the judgement of a court [65]. Plant- related experiments, although few in number, are very’ prominent within the text. ‘The collection of the plant which is called valerian’ [59] is one of the most elaborate in the treatise, and herbal knowledge is a recurring theme of the text that suggests it may have been a specialism of the author.Natural magic recipes, which do not involve the invocation of demons and angels but rely solely on the natural properties of things, account for only a small proportion of the experiments. Only the experiments To make silver or gold writing’ [27] and ‘That a silver penny should seem to be made of bronze’ [47] truly fall into this category' The Renaissance saw the expansion of natural magic as an increasingly mainstream pursuit, as thinkers such as Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Giovanni Battista della Porta strove to find a morally acceptable form of magic. The relative absence of natural magic from FT might, therefore, be seen as an indication of its conservatism. However, the influence of the turn to natural magic is more subtle in the text, manifesting itself in conjurations of living things that, whilst outwardly ‘necromantic’ in form, conceal a reverence for nature that seems more at home in the Renaissance than the Middle Ages.The sole example of harmful magic in the text is ‘The revenge of Troy’ [641, an experiment originally derived from Arabic traditions of image magic, which involves making a wax image of an enemy. A fifteenth-century example can be found in another Cambridge manuscript, ‘The Book of Angels, Rings, Characters and Images of the Planets’ {Liber de Angelis, Annulis, Karacteribus & Ymagibus Planetamm), which was supposedly authored by someone called ‘Messayaac’ and copied by ‘Bokenham’ (possibly William Bockenham, a monk of Norwich with a medical degree from Bologna).46 47 The ‘revenge of Troy’ was a synonym for the ultimate triumph of the weak over the strong derived from Virgil’s Aeneid. In Book 8 (11. 839-40), the Sibyl tells the Trojan leader Aeneas that a new leader will arise in Italy, 'of the race of Achilles, strong in arms, having avenged the ancestors of Troy and the defiled temples of Minerva’ (genus armipotentis Achilli, / ultus auos Troiae templet et temerata Minemae).

The purpose of the experiment is clearly not to kill someone (like the images sometimes used as evidence in witchcraft trials), but to bend someone to the magician’s will by a form of magical torture.Structure of the textKlaascn has observed that ‘manuscripts of necromancy often give the impression of Frankenstein’s monster, stitched together from whatever varied and improbable parts came to hand’.48 49 This is certainly true of FT., although in this case the author has applied some makeup to conceal the monster’s defects. The text aspires to be, but does not altogether succeed in being, a coherent and unified text on necromancy. The author begins with the preliminaries of the art: a description of how to obtain one of the basic ingredients of necromantic experiments (bat’s blood), consecrations to be said over characters and parchment, and instructions on how to construct a circle. He then moves on to specific ‘experiments’, with sections devoted to different purposes. The treatise then concludes with instructions on how to dedicate the instruments of the art (quills, needles, charts, wands and swords) to magical purposes,Л closer look reveals the haphazard composition of the text. Supplementary experiments for categories already dealt with earlier in the text (e.g. the love spells [30, 31, 33, 40, 41]) crop up later in the manuscript, as if as afterthoughts. Not only that, but additions to earlier experiments appear48 Scot. R..

In several cases, the diagrams required to work an experiment earlier in the book do not appear alongside the original experiment but much later, and. in one case, the diagrams for ‘The experiment of the three knights’ appear before the text of the experiment itself.Furthermore, interspersed within the overarching structure are a variety of magical operations that do not sit comfortably within a treatise on necromancy. The experiments in the middle of the text 119-58] are much shorter than the rest of the experiments, and they belong in a book of ‘recipes’ rather than the treatise on necromancy that FT aspires to be. Non-magical recipes begin to appear alongside traditional necromantic magic in this section, such as the experiment ‘To make silver or gold writing' [27] and ‘That a silver penny should seem to be made of bronze’ [47].Throughout the text, there is a tension between the highly instrumental magic of the short experiments and the lengthier and more complex spirit conjurations, which do not have a clear, circumscribed purpose. Klaasen describes these kind of operations as ‘quasi-theurgic’, with 'no clearly predefined goals apart from some form of communication with spirits’.50 They are ‘exploratory magic’ of the kind that reached its apogee in John Dee’s angel conversations.51 In FT, they include ‘An experiment to call the spirit Mosacus’ [6] (twelve pages), ‘An experiment of a hoopoe’ 117] (two pages), ‘The experiment of the three knights ‘ [73] (two pages) and ‘An experiment of Bleth’ [74] (three pages). Strangest of all is ‘The collection of the plant which is called valerian’ [59] (five pages) which straddles the boundary between herbalism, natural magic and necromancy.The preponderance of these ‘speculative’ experiments, alongside lengthy divinatory operations [6, 8, 11, 15], supports Klaassen’s argument that in books of necromantic magic, ‘the text was a means to acquire knowledge from the divine, not a source of knowledge in itself’.52 Rather than specifying in advance what knowledge will be gained from the spirits, or what the spirits will do, the text provided the practitioner with the tools to gain knowledge he could not yet imagine. FT occasionally remarks on his own experience concerning the efficacy of particular experiments, or offers a test: ‘This proved verv true’, the author remarks at the end of [55a], ‘ To win at dice’. Spirits can be made to appear in a glass, ‘as the worker by due apparitions may make a proof’ [lip], and the magician reassures the reader in [29]. ‘if you do not believe it, touch a dog and he will follow you’.

A historiographical preoccupation with astral magic and theurgy as the characteristic magic of the sixteenth century led early scholars to ignore the vast majority of surviving magical texts, which arc actually texts of ritual magic.53 Klaassen has shown that the continuity of sixteenth-century magical texts with their medieval antecedents is far more striking than any discontinuities.54At the same time, however, sixteenth-century magic does have some recognisable features. The self-conscious presentation of texts as ‘magical’ has already been mentioned. Another feature was a growing interest in medicine amongst magicians, something that clearly comes across in FT Sixteenth- century magicians did not, as was previously thought, change their practices as a result of Renaissance scholarship, but they did begin making references to Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, whose De occulta philasophia was first published in Latin in 1533. The fact that FT contains no obvious references to Agrippa strengthens the case that it is a fairly early work, composed in the 1530s when Agrippa’s work was still little known.If there is one feature that defines sixteenth-century magic, however, it is a tendency towards convergence in what had been regarded as distinct branches of the magical arts. Early modem manuscripts of magic present a composite, rather undifferentiated craft in which the disparate strands of medieval magic converge in one manuscript. There is no better example of this increasing interest in 'the broader traditions of magic’55 than Additional 3544. FT demonstrates that by the 1530s, the lack of interest in astrolog}', alchemy, books of secrets, natural philosophy and other naturalia discerned by Klaassen as a feature of medieval necromantic magic was beginning to break down.56 In addition to the section copied from Amald of Villanova’s Opera (1532) |72|. the manuscript contains a collection of 35 magico-medical astrological sigils that seem to have no particular relation to the text (sec Plate 1).

Out-and-out necromancy, involving the invocation of good and evil spirits (and, in some cases, sacrifice)2. Natural magic involving the manipulation of the natural ‘virtues’ of animals (including vivisection and the creation of monsters)3. Natural magic involving the manipulation of the natural‘virtues’ of plants (herbalism)4. Astrological image magic, involving the creation of sigils intended to draw down the powers and influences of the cosmosThese styles of magic will be considered in turn below.1. Necromantic magicRichard Kieckhefer has identified four basic steps to an experiment in necromantic magic: the declaration, the address, the invocations and the instruction.5' The author of FT adheres to this pattern. The form of the declaration may be T conjure’ or T exorcize’, followed by the address (the name of a spirit, person or thing). Alternatively, the address may be a direct apostrophe to the spirit, such as £0 Onely’. However, the author of FT blurs the line between necromantic and natural magic by apostrophising non-supernatural entities too: ‘O good horse’ [10b], T conjure you, four elements’ [13b], ‘I conjure you, water’ [14b], T conjure you, image made of wax’ [18b], T conjure you, sunflower’ [19], T conjure you, apple* [30], ‘I conjure you, noble root ’ [42b], I conjure you, thief’ [45b], T conjure you, valerian’ [59e], T conjure you, needle’ [84b], T conjure you, sword’ [91c| Indeed, conjurations of human persons and inanimate objects are as frequent in the text as conjurations of spirits.FT illustrates the gradual transformation of the acts of declaration and address from their origins in exorcistic formulae adapled for use in demonic magic, to a new kind of magic where the boundary between ‘demonic’ and ‘natural’ magic is rather less clear. The very fact that the magician is addressing a valerian plant in [59] reveals an underlying magical philosophy in which the plant (or rather the virtus within it) is not an inanimate object but a spiritual creature of some sort.

FT shows no evidence of fairy conjuring, another sixteenth-century development,58 59 unless the mysterious malks' and aldcrmalks\" of [8h] and [8i] arc fairies of some kind.The third part of Kieckhefer’s taxonomy of necromancy, the invocations, take a conventional and conservative form in FT, usually staying within the nine categories Kieckhefer identified: God, sacred names for God or Christ, events from the life of Christ, the saints, the Virgin Mary, the angels, material creatures, the Last Judgment and the rulers of the demons.60 Only occasionally does FT deviate into more unusual and enigmatic invocations, such as ‘by the seven frogs’ (10a). Finally, the instruction is the command given to the spirit to do something, which forms the culmination of the experiment, and here too FT is conventional, although it is to be noted that in several experiments the instruction is a very general one.FT shares some features with one of the earliest surviving English manuscripts of magic, the fifteenth-century British Library MS Rawlinson D.252.61 62 Like the Rawlinson MSS, FT is in the tradition of the ‘mystical’ or ‘visionary’ necromancy, and FT shares with Rawlinson a preoccupation with using a child-medium to sen7 for spirits in a crystal, as well as a devotion to theft-detection and treasure hunting (albeit theГ')treasure experiments have been removed from FT). ~ Klaassen has noted that the unifying theme of the Rawlinson MSS is ‘a belief in the power of Christian ritual practice’: ‘The scribes and authors of the material evidently considered contemporary orthodox rituals, and more or less credible elaborations upon them, as particularly powerful or desirable in magical operations’. Exactly the same can be said of FT.Kieckhefer has noticed the prevalence of onychomancy or captoptromancy (divination in a fingernail) in medieval magical texts, which usually required a medium in the form of a boy below the age of twelve who was bom in wedlock.63 FT, unlike the Munich Handbook, expects that it is just as likely for a ‘mayde chyld’ (a girl) to be used, and specifies different oils of anointing for boys’ and girls’ thumbs: olive oil for a girl and ‘meate ovle’ for a boy [8b|.

Natural magic: making monstersThe majority of the experiments in FT arc necromantic or contain noticeable necromantic elements, but the text also draws on a kind of natural magic that has been examined in detail by Sophie Page: the creation of monsters. ‘An experiment of a hoopoe” [17] belongs to this tradition, and requires the practitioner to kill a hoopoe, collect its blood and leave it in a vessel for a number of64 Louis, C. (cd ), The Commonplace Book of Robert Reynes of Acle: An Edition of Tanner MS 407 (London: Garland, 1980), pp. 169-70.XXXll"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PR33days. When the vessel is next uncovered the blood will contain worms (presumably maggots), and after more days have passed, only a single tly will remain in the vessel. The fly is then placed in the centre of a globe made from crushed hazelnuts, almonds and fossiliferous stone. The globe is then replaced in the vessel, and after a few days it will have been replaced by a magical hoopoe (the monster). This ‘hoopoe’ should then be killed and roasted on a spit while the practitioner collects its fat. The fat of the magical hoopoe is the final product of the experiment, since if it is smeared on the eyes it will allow him to see spirits.The ultimate origin of experiments of this kind is the Liber vaccae (‘Book of the Cow’), a medieval translation of a ninth-century Arabic work.65 * The focus of the Liber vaccae is the manipulation of natural properties, taking advantage of the mysterious processes of conception, birth and spontaneous generation. The belief that worms and maggots were spontaneously generated from flesh, derived from Aristotle, was universally accepted until 1668, when Francesco Redi disproved it by experiment. Understandably, the notion that a living creature could come into being from the flesh of another animal strengthened the belief that the flesh of humans and animals contained a mysterious (and indeed magical) virtus which gave life to worms, maggots in dead flesh and parasites like tapeworms in living flesh. One of the aims of the Liber vaccae was to harness the spiritual power of spontaneous generation as instrumental magic.One type of experiment in the Liber vaccae involves the impregnation of animals with mixtures of human semen and chemical elements, leading to the birth of a monster which must be kept concealed in a dark room. As in FT, the ultimate aim is to make use of body parts from the monstrous creation because they have magical properties. In the same way that the fly of FT is encased in a mixture of ground nuts and fossiliferous stone, the monsters in the Liber vaccae are fed a mixture of leaves and ground-up stone called almathar tabea 66 The Liber TheysoJius, an appendix to the late medieval Liber Razielis, contains an experiment to create a magical eye lotion (as in [17]) which requires a hoopoe, a turtledove, a dove, parts of a black cat and the eyes of black goat. The parts are ground up and processed, then buried in dung and exhumed days later; the worms m the mixture are then reburied and exhumed after nine days, after which there will only be one worm left This worm, which has65 Page (2013), pp. 49-54.1,0 Ibid. pp. 56-7.XXXI11iled m"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PR34absorbed the virtus of all the other creatures, will be used to make the eye ointment.67The appearance of an experiment like 117] in FT demonstrates that, by the 1530s, the particular magical tradition of creating magical monsters for Iheir body parts had become absorbed within a broader tradition of necromantic magic, even though monster-creation was not originally necromantic. As Page has argued, the Liber vaccae and Liber Theysolius, whilst still controversial, were more acceptable than books of outright spirit invocation in a monastic context. Their presence in the library at St Augustine’s, Canterbury' could have been justified by the fact that they were about natural secrets and the discovery of hidden virtutes.3. Natural magic: herbalismThe dominant form of natural magic in FT, herbalism, is profoundly intertwined with necromancy in this text. The author conjures plants in much the same way as spirits, beginning with the sunflower in |19|. The conjuration of vervain [42a—bj treats the plant as a spiritual creature by requiring the practitioner to leave gifts of money around the plant before it is pulled out of the ground. The reason why is made quite clear: ‘that you should not leave your virtue in the earth5. In other words, a magical process was needed to ensure the virtue of the plant remained with it when it left the earth, otherwise the plant would be useless to the practitioner. The use of herbs is not usually associated with ritual magic, but in fact it has a long history in learned magical texts. A sixteenth-century English manuscript of the Sepher Raziel, for instance, contains descriptions of the magical properties of 24 herbs.68The collection of valerian takes anthropomorphisation of the plant even further. First, the magician must banish any demons in the surrounding air, ‘[so] that you should not have the power and virtue of this plant which I want to conjure5 [59c], The magician must then ‘marry5 the valerian plant by placing a gold ring over it, ‘just like the custom with women getting married5, saying, ‘0 valerian, I espouse you; with my wealth I honour you ’ [59e],Marriage was one of the seven sacraments, even though a priest was not necessary to perform a marriage, and this rile may have been intended to add the power of the sacrament to the virtus of the valerian. However, it also suggests an intimate67 Ibid. pp. 70-1.fiS British Library MS Sloane 3826. fols 16v—20r.XXXIV"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"relationship between the magician and ‘holy valerian, blessed by the most high Almighty God’. The plant appears more times than any other in FT.69 * * The valerian experiment is, on the face of it, just a ritual for pulling up a plant, but by including an address to demons at the beginning and making use of a sacrament, it acquires the characteristics of necromancy. Furthermore, ll is by no means clear who the magician is addressing when he conjures the plant itself: did he imagine the virtus itself as an intelligent spiritual entity dwelling inside the plant'7704. Astrological image magicThe final style of magic to make an appearance in FT is what Klaassen classifies as ‘Scholastic image magic’. This involved the creation of three-dimensional images or two-dimensional seals to a precise specification, in order to draw down the natural astrological influences. The ultimate origin of this philosophy was Al-Kindi’s De Radiis Stell arum (‘On the Rays of the Stars’), which held that every star emitted rays of ‘influence’ on the lower world, whose form could change depending on the disposition of the stars. Because things in the lower world arc connected to the stars by means of influences, the rearrangement of forms in the lower world by the making of images, suffumigations and other ntes can alter the influence of the stars. When the great Dominican theologian Albert the Great included these ideas in his Speculum astronomiae (‘Minor of Astronomy’) in the thirteenth century, he gave a degree of respectability to practices derived from Arabic astral 'image magic’. 1Image magic was not without its detractors, but an apparent endorsement by Scholastic philosophy guaranteed it a place in monastic libraries such as St Augustine’s, Canterbury.72 In medicine, in particular, astrological image magic came to play a key role, and it is no accident that the ‘sigils of Master Arnold’ [721 come from ‘a book of physic’. The sigils that appear69 Valerian is mentioned eighteen times in [41].

On the typical components of gathering rituals see Weil. M. S., ‘Magiferous Plants in Medieval English Herbalism’, unpublished PhD thesis (University of Michigan, 1988), pp. 128 9.

It is possible that the author copied them just to make the manuscript impressive (magicians were certainly not above such window-dressing), or that they related to a branch of his personal practice that he did not consider worth explaining or describing in detail. A cruder form of image magic is represented by ‘The revenge of Troy’ [64], which has acquired strongly necromantic elements before it appears in this text.Paul Foreman, or whoever wrote FT, did not include natural magic and image magic alongside necromancy because he was coy about the invocation of spirits, but rather because, by the 1530s, they had become part of the expected practice of a necromancer. The centrality of necromancy to FT raises the question of how the author reconciled his Christian faith (and indeed his likely clerical status) with the invocation of angels and demons. In fact, FT puts forward a surprisingly eloquent implicit theological justification for necromantic magic. In the ‘experiment to call Mosacus’ [6p], the magician thunders:I conjure and charge thee ... that you appear by the goodness of God; which God hath made man to his own likeness and you, by his justice, hath condemned for your pride; and by his mercy which hath redeemed mankind, and by the virginity and meekness of the sacred Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by his power which broke hell and despoiled your fellows: that you give me me a faithful and true answer of the things that I shall demand of you, and that you give obedience unto my words and do that I desire of you. I conjure о you wise spirits by the obedience in the which you ought to your superiors, and by this holy name of God ... that you truly obey.The theology implicit in this conjuration sees man as superior to demons, but also to angels, since Christ came in the likeness of a man and died for the human race, not for invisible beings. Late medieval theology, in which not only Christ but also his mother was considered to be ‘higher than the angels', put enormous stress on the sacredness of human nature. Therefore, although the angels and demons remain more powerful than the magical operator in himself, by drawing upon the power of Christ, his mother Mary' and the saints, the magician could hope to constrain angels and demons every time. FT exudes confidence that words lifted from the liturgy and the sacraments arc enough, in themselves, to compel spirits. Perhaps the theological justification of necromancy is best understood as a kind of spiritual brinkmanship whose ultimate puipose, in addition to fulfilling the magician’s will, was to demonstrate the superiority of one Christian man over the entire company of hell. The necromancer might belie\\'e, in good conscience, that his practice yyras bringing glory to God by asserting the poyver of the sacraments and of Christ.xxxvi"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PR37It is clear from even a cursory reading of FT that necromancy was part of its author’s life of faith rather than a transgressive practice that ran counter to it. Medieval clerical magicians did not lead schizophrenic, compartmentalised lives in which they were Christians in one life, and magical practitioners in another. At the same time, the magician’s confidence was potential evidence of his unorthodoxy, since mainstream Catholic opinion had always condemned the practice of magic. This may explain why FTs author takes pains to situate himself within Catholic orthodoxy, insisting on the recitation of the Athanasian Creed (beginning ‘Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith...’), and reiterating Ins belief in transubstantiation [59h], Whether the author’s theological pretensions simply masked a desire to obtain his will by supernatural means we can have no way of knowing.xxx viited"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"EDITOR’S NOTENo attempt has been made to retain the original layout of the text, and the numbering of paragraphs in this edition has been added to aid study of the text. Paragraphs are numbered according to the number assigned to the experiment in on the contents page; each separate stage of the magical operation is then indicated by a new letter, as la, lb etc. When the number of stages within the experiment exceeds the number of letters in the Roman alphabet, Greek letters have been used.The original text makes heavy use of abbreviations conventional in late medieval Latin and early modem English, including manicules (a dash above a letter to indicate the letters ‘n’ or hn’) and contractions of frequently- used terms (e g. dm for domine, sedum for secundum). In order to aid understanding of the Latin text, abbreviations are expanded in square brackets m all cases, thus sedum becomes se[cun]dum.

Where marginal annotations add nothing to the text, for instance as reminders for the reader of titles of experiments that already appear in the main text, they have been omitted. Also omitted are words written twice by the scribe in error.The medieval spelling of the Latin has been retained (e g. hec for Classical Latin haec, filij for filii), but to avoid confusion the Greek letters chi and rho (xp) which are used in the text to spell the name of Christ, are transliterated: so xpistus becomes christus in all cases.

Astrological symbols have been replaced in all cases by the name of the heavenly body in square brackets. The character * appears wherever there are crosses in the original manuscript. As Klaassen explains, The crosses serve as visual cues to set them off from the rest of the text and also to indicate that the operator should make the sign of the cross’. 3 This was a direct borrowing from the conventions of liturgical books such as missals, pontificals and books of exorcisms3 Klaassen, F., ‘Three early modern magic rituals to spoil witches’, Opuscule1 1 (2011), pp. 1-10, n. p. 8."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The translationIn all cases, the translation appears on the right hand side of the original text. Magical texts present a particular challenge to the translator, insofar as many names and words within the text were never intended to be translated. They are verba ignota whose very incomprehensibility w as supposed to convey the magical character of the text. However, verba ignota can sometimes be mixed in with what appears to be Latin, and in these cases it is not always easy to decide whether the entire sentence should be left untranslated as a collection of verba ignota, or whether the apparently intelligible words within the incomprehensible passage should be translated. I have made the decision to translate individual intelligible Latin words whenever possible, but I have left untranslated all Greek, Hebrew and Arabic words, on the basis that the author clearly did not understand these languages and simply borrowed w7ords for their sound and effect rather than their meaning.A further challenge in translating Additional 3544 is the macaronic nature of the text: Latin and English are freely mixed together in some passages, and the author frequently alternates between English and Latin in any given experiment. For this reason, in order to maintain the flow of the translation, I have included a transcription of the English passages in modem spelling on the right hand side of the page, distinguished from the translated passages by italics. Whilst this allows the translation to be read as a continuous text, it also allows the early modem English of the original text, which is almost entirely without punctuation, to be interpreted for the modem reader. No attempt has been made to substitute modern equivalents for the archaic English vocabulary, but modem spelling is used on the right hand side and obsolete terms explained in the notes. Naturally, any attempt to insert punctuation into an unpunctuated text is subject to the editor's own interpreation. and the editor takes full responsibility for any remaining errors both in the translation and the transcription of the original text.In addition to punctuation, I have also added speech marks to the translated text to indicate the parts of the text that were to be spoken by the magician (or Ins assistant), and to distinguish them from ’stage directions’. Where the original text refers to psalms by their opening words in the Latin Vulgate (conventional at the time), the translation gives the number of the psalm in the Authorised Version: thus Miserere met Dens appears in the translation as Psalm 51. The reader should be aware that the numbering of psalms m the Vulgate differs from the Authorised Version and all other English Bibles, since it is one psalm behind (thus Psalm 51 in the Authorised Version is Psalm 50 in the Vulgate).

St Cyprian has a longstanding association with magic and was considered the unofficial patron saint of magicians.7. It was essential in medieval necromancy that the book of magic should itself be a magical object. On Libri consecrationum see Klaassen (2013), pp. 137-8).8. This refers to a belief that a spirit guarding treasure might cause the earth to swallow it up. frustrating the attempts of the treasure-hunter.9. The closest match for the word zinzipum in RMLWL is zinziperum, meaning ‘ginger’, but this makes no sense in the context.10. Compare with the conjuration of Sibylla in Reginald Scot’s Discoverie of Witchcraft (London. 1665), pp. 246-8. Scot describes Sibylia as a ‘sister of the fairies’. The name is originally derived from the Sibyl of ancient times, who acted as an oracle of the God Apollo: the name Sibyl was intimately associated with prophesying the future, therefore.II, A version of the Coniuratio licencialis (licence for spirits to depart) that appears in many books of necromancy (see Klaassen (2013), p. 136).12, The Confiteor is a set formula used at the beginning of the liturgy of the hours and in the mass: Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, beatae Manae semper virgini, beato Michaeli archangelo, beato loanni Baptistae, sanctis apostolis Petro et. Paulo, omnibus sanctis, et tibi pater: quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo et opere: mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

Therefore I beseech the Blessed Mary ever-virgin. Blessed Michael the archangel, Blessed John the Baptist, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, all the saints, and you.

The Misereatur is the response: Misereatur nostri omnipotens Deus et, dimissis peccatis nostris, perducat nos ad vitam aeternam (‘May Almighty God have mercy on us. forgive us our sins, and lead us to life everlasting’).13.

I am unable to identify this name, but in the context it is probably meant to be a name of God.15. Camino: literally ‘chimney’ (RMLWL).16. Onely: a variant name of the spirit Honely who is called into a crystal to detect theft in the Munich Handbook (Kieckhefer (1997), pp. 244-5).17. A variant of a fairly common experiment found in books of necromancy. See Kieckhefer (1997), pp. 329 42 for examples from the Munich Handbook which involve anointing a child’s nail with olive oil.18. Similar names appear in an experiment for detecting a theft in the nail of a nine year-old boy in the Munich Handbook: Egippia, Benoham, Beanke (vel Beanre), Reranressym, Alredessym, Elemidyri, Fecolinie, Dysi, Medirini, Alhea, Heresim, Egippia, Benoham, Haham, Ezirohias, Bohodi, Hohada, Anna, Hohanna, Ohereo, Metaliteps, Aregero, Agertho, Aliberri, Halba (Kieckhefer (1997), p. 246).19. Sic. for ‘chrismation’, a reference to the oil of catechumens with which a child was signed at baptism.20. ‘Malks’: it is clear from the context that this word is intended to refer to a kind of spirit It is possible that ‘malk’ is a corruption of the Arabic malik (‘angel’).21. This experiment is a version of one that appears in two versions in the Munich Handbook (Kieckhefer (1997), pp. 235ML 344-5): ‘Let these names be written on a host m an empty house, in the dark of the night, in the Hebrew manner: Tuditha. Stelpha, Alpha, Draco, Mariodo. Ypation. When these have been written, go back a little way from the place’. However, the version in the Munich Handbook is simpler and lacks the requirements concerning the stirrup and the method of calling the horse back by burving its dung.22 A version of ‘The Mirror of Floron' that appears in the Munich Handbook (Kieckhefer (1997). pp. 236-8).23. ‘Lent meats’: fish or vegetables.24. The prayer is actually cod-Arabic rather than ‘Chaldaic’. It is clearly derived from the same source as an equally garbled Arabic prayer in the Munich Handbook (Kieckhefer (1997), pp. 236 7).25 This experiment is very similar to an invocation of Theltrion, Spireon. Botheon and Mahireon that appears in BL MS Rawlinson D.252, fols 103r-107r (see Klaassen (2013). p. 236 n. 55).26. The idea of the four kings derived ultimately from a vastly influential twelfth-century (or earlier) text, the Speculum astronotniae. Conjurations of the four kings are common in medieval and early modern necromantic texts (Klaassen (2013). pp. 131-3).27. A partial quotation from Psalm 35:6.28. ‘The theft of Achan’: the reference is to a story in Joshua 7:19-26 in which an Israelite warrior, Achan, took a robe, 200 shekels and a bar of gold from the city of Ai. Joshua judged Achan guilty and the people stoned him to death.29. The hand changes from Gothic to italic script.30. ‘Urinal’: this word has two literal senses: a chamberpot for receiving urine and a glass flask for analysing urine in medicine (see Oizumi. A. (ed ), A Complete Concordance to the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, 2nd edn (Ilildesheim: Olms- Wcidmann. 2003), vol. 13, p. 1348). The word was also used in alchemy to mean a glass phial or vial shaped like the medical instrument (Abraham. L., A Dictionary of Alchemical Imagery (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 1998). p. 207).31 The reference is to an ancient prayer of assistance found in the Rituale Romanum: Actiones nostras, quaesumus Domine, aspirando perveni, et adiuvando prosequere, ut cuncta nostra oratio et operatio a te semper incipiat, et per te coepta finiatur (‘Direct, we beseech you, О Lord, our prayers and our actions by your holy125"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"PA 126inspirations and earn1 them on by your gracious assistance, so that every work of ours may always begin with you, and through you come to completion. Amen’).32. A bird extensively used in European magic. For references to the literature on magical uses of the hoopoe see Kieckhefer (1997). p. 66 -7, n. 25.33. ‘Finger-shaped things pulled out of rocks’: dactulos is in this case a reference to long, thin fossils found inside rocks (RMLWL).34. ‘Filberts’: hazelnuts.35. ‘The flower called buttercup’: a speculative translation. Buta may be a Latin rendering of the Greek bouturon, meaning ‘butter’, referring to the flower ranunculus (commonly known as buttercup).36. A reference to the jewelled breastplate worn by the high priest Aaron in the Hook of Exodus.37. The procedure that this experiment recommends for a mole is in many other texts associated with a toad: seal the mouth, make holes in the body and leave it in an ant-hill; then take the bones and put them in water. The bone or bones that go against the current are deemed to have magical qualities, Andrew Chumbley, in The Leaper Between: An Historical Study of the Toad-hone Amulet (Three Hands Press, 2012), pp, 21,26-9 describes the use of a similar ritual involving a toad in love magic.38. The ‘Rotas Square’, a quadruple palindrome, has been associated with magic since the first century CE and is a rearrangement of the letters that make up pater noster (twice) together with the letters a and о repeated twice (for alpha and omega)39. ‘The sedition of St Eaurence’: the meaning of this phrase is unclear, but it may refer to the story that St Laurence played a trick on his pagan Roman persecutors. When they demanded he bring out ‘the treasures of the church’ he brought them the poor and destitute.40. ‘Mortagon’: a type of lily. Lilitim martagon (see Voigts, L. E., ‘Plants and Planets: Linking the Vegetable with the Celestial in Late Medieval Texts' in Dendle, P. and Touwaide, A. (eds). Health and Healing from the Medieval Garden (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2008), pp. 29-46, at p. 44). Mortagon was associated with the planet Mars, hence the alternative name given here, martas.4. ‘Gypsies’: The word Egyptius, in this context, is most likely to mean gypsy rather than Egyptian. Gypsies were first attested in England in 1505, so this is an early reference to the gypsy reputation for magical skill.42. ‘Devil’s bit’: autumn hawkbit or Leontodon autumnalis, a flower resembling a dandelion.43. The vigil of the Assumption is the evening of 14 August The month of May was particularly associated with Mary.44. The requirement that a plant should be dug from the ground, roots and all, without using an iron instrument is found in Anglo-Saxon herbals (Weil (1988), p. 110). The prohibition on iron recalls fairies’ antipathy to the metal.45. ‘Swelling’: tumeum may be a variant of tumor (‘swelling’, RMLWL), referring to the largest part of the plant’s root.46. On this ancient use of vervain see Weil (1988), p. 114.47. ‘Hart’s tongue’: a type of fern, Asplenium scolopendrium.48. Deus laude are not the opening w ords of any psalm.49. ‘Ribwort’: broadleaf plantain or Plantago major.50. ‘Mulberry'’: a doubtful reading of morvserere, which could be a variant of morus (‘mulberry’) or morella (‘nightshade’) (RMLWL). Perhaps morns aereriae (‘bronze mulberry’) is meant.51. For a conjuration by the Seven Sleepers see British Library MS Sloane 962, fols 9v-lOr (quoted in Kieckhefer (1997), pp. 147-8, 153).126"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"РА12752. The ‘seven sleepers’ were seven young men of Ephesus who, according to Jacques de Voragine’s Golden Legend, hid in a cave from Diocletian’s third-century persecution of Christians and slept for around 180 years before re-appearing.53. Valuero is here read as a misspelling of the future imperative valeto.54. In the mass and in the liturgy of the hours, the misereatur (which could be said by a layperson) was followed by an absolution when pronounced by a priest. To require a magical practitioner who might not be a priest to say the absolution was a deviation from orthodoxy.55. A version of the Vinculum Salomonis that appears in many texts of necromancy (see Klaasscn (2013), pp. 136-7).56. This seems to be suggesting that the image should be baptised like a baby, a procedure reminiscent of the practice of the North Berwick witches, who baptised a cal in the name of James VI of Scotland in order to harm the king in 1589 (Newes from Scotland (London, 1591), pp. 16-17).57. Fexas: a variant oi feces (‘excrement’), singular oifex (which can also mean ‘lye’) (RMLWL).58. The inclusion of the name of someone’s mother to enhance the power of magical words over them is an ancient feature of western magic.59. An inversion of the opening words of Psalm 72: Deus indicium tuum regi da (‘O God, give the king your judgement’).60. Compare with the Sigilla Salomonis in BL MS Rawlinson D.252, fol.23v.61. ‘Dragon’s blood’: cinnabar (native mercury sulphide). See Abraham (1998), p. 41.62. ‘White roast meat’: a conjectural translation. RMLWL has assatura as a variant of assatio, meaning the roasting of meat.63. ‘Pyx’: a small silver vessel with a lid, usually used for reserving the consecrated bread after the mass.64. ‘The fifth and seventh tribes of Judah’: Dan and Gad.65. The reference is to Arnald of Villanova’s De sigillis, in Opera nuperrime revisa, cum ipsius vita recenter hie apposita (Lyons, 1532), fol. 301v-302r.66. ‘Portice’: a side-chapel or chamber adjacent to a church (see Wright, J. R., A Companion to Bede: A Reader's Commentary on The Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Grand Rapids, MN: Eeerdmans, 2008). pp. 43-4). Here the word may refer to a natural arch or enclosure made by the trees of the wood, although it is unclear where the words are supposed to be written.67. The north is traditionally associated with evil and Satan in ritual magic, and this may explain why conversation with the spirit called from the north is inadvisable.68 ‘The covering from this urinal’: ‘urinal’ in this case may mean a chamberpot; the covering may be the wooden cover that often fitted over a champerpot.69. ‘The changer’: the Latin vertellus is probably a variant of the adjective vertilis (RMLWL). meaning ‘concerned with change, mutable’. This may reflect a belief that the swallow used this feather to change direction in flight.70. ‘Gander’: a doubtful translation. It is possible that acansacor is another variant of RMLWL'я anser. ancer, aucer. anculus and ancerulus. the bird mentioned shortly afterward [86a] is certainly a gander However, acansacor could also be read atansacor, in which case it is probably a reference to the plant tansy (RMLWL has variants athanasia, atonasia, tanacetum and tanesetum).71. ‘Athamc’: a knife used for magical purposes. Although the word althama or athama simply means ‘knife’, the translation ‘athame’ is preferred here as it conveys the knife’s magical significance.127"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"PA12872. ‘Money’: a doubtful translation of nomi.
