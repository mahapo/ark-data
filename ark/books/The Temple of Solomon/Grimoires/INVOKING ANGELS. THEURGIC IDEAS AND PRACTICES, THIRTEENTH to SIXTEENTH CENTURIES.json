During that time my chil­dren grew up and left home, and I accepted a position at Rice University and moved from Ontario to Texas. Of these life-changing events, finishing this book was in no way the least important. I owe many debts of gratitude, first to the other eight contributors, for patiently bearing with me all this time, delivering everything I asked for, and believing in the project; and to my two careful and perceptive research assistants, Margaret McCarthy, who drafted the bibliogra­phy, and Jessica McNally, who helped with many finicky bits of proofreading and consistency checking. The work of both has been invaluable. The two anon­ymous readers for Penn State Press also significantly informed the final shape of the book, and the diligence and keen attention of Suzanne Wolk, copyeditor, has profoundly affected both the consistency of its referencing and the quality of its prose. For comments on my pieces of the book at various times and in various stages, and for moral support at the right moments, I would like to thank Joseph Goering, Karen Kletter, and Nicholas Watson. My father, David Fanger, helped me to polish my translation of the elegant French of Julien Veronese and with much else besides. My husband, Paul Coyne, saw our children off, packed up our house, and arranged for the material transport of everything I own over the thirteen hundred miles between us; for that, and perhaps more than anything else for agreeing to come with me and start our lives over in Texas, he is sine quo non. To Jim Faubion I owe gratitude for reading and responding to the second incarnation of the introduction, and to him and to W. R.

This is the book by which anyone at all can be saved and unhesitatingly be led forth into eternal life .... This is the book which was the most precious thing given by the Lord-more precious than anything else except the sacraments. This is the book by which corporeal and visible nature can speak, converse, and be instructed by that which is incorporeal and invisible. -from the final paragraph of the Liber iuratus Honorii Naked as they may be, abstracted from context and presented in the evident in­nocence of their wish fulfillment, these claims, which conclude the fourteenth­century Sworn Book of Honorius, 1 testify to the persistence of two fundamental questions central to this volume: L How may the divine be manifest in this world and in things that human be­ings can know? 2. How may human beings, unfit for direct knowledge of the divine, neverthe­less engage with divine things in order to be saved? There are other, more conventional responses to these questions in the later Middle Ages, but this volume is about some of the less conventional ones. The essays collected here look at a variety of alternative views of the relationship of human beings with the divine, as recorded in texts that engage traditional the­ologies and liturgies in unusual ways, sometimes weaving together sources from more than one religion and sometimes from sources commonly regarded as magical. Some of these texts were condemned by medieval and early modern theologians as being in the same class as demonic magic. Despite their status, then and now, outside the canon of medieval religious and devotional writings,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2 INVOKING ANGELS these texts offer important perspectives on the study of religion in the Middle Ages. In general, they attest to the plurality of visions of religious practice, not only in the later Middle Ages but into the sixteenth century. They also demon­strate that this plurality included fertile cross-cultural exchange. Their abun­dance in manuscript attests to an increasing interest in alternative forms of access to the divine, and perhaps also to a parallel anxiety that ordinary liturgies and sacraments might not be sufficient to procure salvation. Finally, these vari­ous approaches to the divine also bear upon natural philosophy, science, and rationality, demanding more nuanced approaches to the relationships between scientific practices and devotional ones. Until fairly recently, these works had remained almost untouched by histo­rians. Starting in the late 1980s, there began to be a marked increase in scholar­ship on medieval ritual magic texts and, relatedly, on the broader problem of magic. Over the past ten years, the trickle of new articles, books, and editions of these texts has increased to something that might almost be called a spate. In my 1998 collection Conjuring Spirits, I complained that the area oftexts and manu­scripts of medieval intellectual magic still had too little coverage beyond what was available in Lynn Thorndike's History of Magic and Experimental Science, completed in 1958.2 Now the area looks completely different. In fact, important new discoveries are coming so thick and fast that it is often difficult for publi­cation to keep up-getting a new discovery into print before it is outdated is a challenge that can be both exhilarating and frustrating for those involved. 3 For this book, I have solicited contributions from scholars whose work has made significant inroads into this former wilderness territory. Taken together, the essays collected here shed light on connections between the domains of religion and science as continuous aspects ofhabitus for writers and operators of these texts; they show how necessary it is to consider medieval and early modern epistemology as a whole, within the context of all the kinds of texts that concern it. In the history of ideas, the \"magical\" has often emerged as a label for an idea or approach that apparently should have been broken away from earlier-a problem of fossilized thinking. 4 Yet if modern science has tended to define itself by opposition to a magic that was in principle older, less knowing, and less pro­gressive, at the same time the process of \"normal science\" has always prag­matically adapted itself to the modes of thought, explanation, and experimental practice of the time. So also has normal magic, of course. In different ways the cosmic infusion of knowledge sought by the liturgy of the Ars notoria (discussed by Veronese), the spiritual cosmology detailed in Antonio da Montolmo's De occultis et manifestis (discussed by Weill-Parot), and the spirit-conjuring diaries of Humphrey Gilbert (discussed by Klaassen) all show how medieval and early"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 modern intellectual writers might associate the angelic worlds and the worlds of human knowledge at once experimentally, scientifically, and spiritually. Another aspect of the premodern epistemology illuminated by these essays is the purposeful bricolage of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic ritual elements that appear in these texts. While the mutual influences of medieval Jewish, Chris­tian, and Islamic writers on philosophy and science have long been a subject of examination for intellectual historians, the interaction between these groups on typological, angelological, and liturgical levels has been much harder to study, in part because of restrictions imposed by disciplinary boundaries, but more significantly because the data for such interactions depend so strongly on texts that are examined here in depth, in some cases for the first time. Many essays in this volume are concerned with key points of this intercultural and interreligious conversation. Topics range from the Latin Liber Razielis and Liber de essentia spirituum, discussed by Sophie Page, to new findings on the probable relation­ship between Christian, Jewish, and Muslim influences on the Liber iuratus Honorii, by Jan Veenstra and Katelyn Mesler, to analyses of the way Jewish and Christian identities are formed through and against ideas about each other's li­turgical practices, as shown in essays by myself, Harvey Hames, and Elliot Wolf­son. It is only by opening up the history of ideas, as well as the various histories of science and spirituality, to contemplation of texts of this kind that we can begin to form a truly historical picture of medieval and early modern life. I. Texts and Contexts One goal of this book is to bring forward new research data for scholars who specialize in medieval manuscripts of magic; but it is also hoped that the book may provide some useful information to a broader audience of readers inter­ested in contiguous areas of medieval social, cultural, and religious history. Be­cause not all potential readers will be familiar with the texts under discussion in this volume, what follows is a brief conspectus, partly to give novice readers a thumbnail sketch of these relatively obscure texts, partly to indicate something of the way the historical narrative around them will be further changed by the essays in this book. The Ars notoria or Notory Art The Ars notoria was a text ascribed to Solomon containing a lengthy set of prayers and rituals practiced for the purpose of gaining knowledge from angels. It was one of the most common and popular works of medieval angel magic, yet"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4 INVOKING ANGELS until recently it had not been deemed worthy of a critical edition. According to Julien Veronese, who has produced the first critical edition of the text and is the scholar most intimate with its history, it probably emerged in the late twelfth century in northern Italy, probably in the region of Bologna. 5 Given that the period of emergence of the Ars notoria corresponds with the rise of the universi­ties, it is perhaps unsurprising that the sought-for knowledge here is curricular knowledge: the work petitions angels to transmit knowledge of the seven liberal arts, philosophy, and theology in the order in which they were supposed to have been learned by the student. The operator of the ritual is aided in this quest by an elaborate set of meditative figures, the notae (or notes), whence, according to the text's own etymology, is derived the word no to ria. 6 The word appears to be related to \"notary,\" and scribes do sometimes interchange the two spellings.' The enormous appeal of the text may be judged not only by the number of manuscripts in circulation (there is also more than one early printed edition),8 but also by the number of theological warnings issued about it. Perhaps the most frequently repeated caveat had to do with the likelihood that the prayers using words in unknown languages might summon demons, despite all asser­tions to the contrary. Yet even though condemnations of the text were frequent, it is also clear (as will be seen below in the case of John of Morigny) that at least some people encountering it for the first time had no sense of it as a condemned or dangerous work but rather apprehended it, at least at first, as a viable set of prayers that sought reasonable benefits by legitimate means. The prayers them­selves (at least those that do not use unknown names-there are many lengthy prayers in a medley of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic) use stan­dard liturgical formulae and are indistinguishable from other Catholic prayers by style or content. Depictions of angels often decorate the pages. Some part of the popularity of the Ars notoria was thus probably due to its self-representation as sacred; no doubt its proliferation was helped along, too, by the pragmatic nature of its advertised goals (which might potentially ease the expense of university study, reducing time spent on education and the over­all cost of books and exemplars). By the late fourteenth century the text existed in several versions, and copies from this period can be found deriving from many European locations. The earliest, or \"A,\" version (as Veronese labels it in his edition}, is an unglossed ritual containing prayers, notae, and some mytho­historical context, but almost no ritual instruction; a slightly later version (the \"B\" version)9 includes the original prayers and notae and adds an extensive gloss containing ritual instructions and further mythohistorical context. The gloss offers clues to the use and reception of the basic liturgy, answering some impor­tant questions about how the ritual was supposed to be performed and how it"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 was understood and thought about. Prior to the work of Veronese, the relation between the various versions of the notory art was unknown, and the glossed -rersion was essentially unread. In his chapter in this volume, Veronese gives a descriptive and interpretive account of the glossed version, describing the oper­ating instructions as represented in the glosses in Paris, Bibliotheque nationale de France, lat. 9336, then zooming out to treat more broadly some of the opera­tive resemblances between the Ars notoria, Neoplatonic theurgy, and Christian sacraments. As was the common fate of many medieval liturgies, the notary art was fre­quently taken apart and its components repurposed; its prayers, verbal formulae, and structuring ideas were reused in other works, some more nearly and some more distantly related to it. The work that is most explicitly connected to it is the Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching by John of Morigny. John of Morigny John was a monk of the Benedictine order at Morigny, educated at Chartres and Orleans and active in the first quarter of the fourteenth century. What is known about him comes almost entirely fr om his own Liber florum celestis doctrine (Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching), which, in addition to containing a lengthy prayer text (modeled on the Ars notoria, and similarly designed to peti­tion angels for the transmission of curricular knowledge), includes many auto­biographical passages. 10 John's writings are a key source of information about the Ars notoria, since he describes his own and others' experience of its oper­ation before learning (via a vision induced by the Ars notoria itself) that the prayers in outlandish tongues had in fa ct been corrupted by subtle insertion of demonic invocations.U By his own account, John discovered the Ars notoria when he was a student too poor to afford books. He had acquired a work of necromancy from a col­league and copied as much of it as he could, but he was beset by doubts about pursuing its rituals. After consulting a Lombard doctor named Jacob, he was directed to the Ars notoria, from which, according to the doctor, he might ob­tain all the knowledge he sought without danger to his soul. Iz Guided by the doctor, John first approached the Ars notoria as a sacred text and a wholesome alternative to the demonic conjurations he had been contemplating. As he used the art, he learned better. The Ars notoria opened vistas on a dark visionary landscape filled with nightmarish forms and demons masquerading as monks or persons of the Trinity. John was eventually helped to free himself by Christ, John the Evangelist, and especially the Virgin Mary. When he finally"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 INVOKING ANGELS laid aside the Ars notoria, still wishing to obtain what he calls \"the good part of his purpose;' he sought from the Virgin permission to compose his own art, similarly intended to infuse the operator with knowledge of the liberal arts, phi­losophy, and theology with only thirty simple prayers. The Virgin agreed, and the Book of Thirty Prayers (the primary liturgy of the Liber Jlorum) was delivered, its express purpose to supplant and destroy the corrupt Ars notoria. It offered worthy seekers an alternative mode of obtaining knowledge through instruction from the Virgin.13 This text is a recent discovery. Unlike the Ars notoria (which, though chroni­cally understudied in the past, has always been known to exist in printed books as well as manuscripts), the text of the Flowers of Heavenly Te aching was not actually known to survive at all much before the 1990s. In the Grandes Chro­niques de France there is recorded for the year 1323 a somewhat sensational ac­count of the burning of a work by a monk who attempted, claiming instruction from the Virgin Mary, to bring back the condemned Ars notoria in another guise;14 but it is not until1987 that the first notice of a connection between the monk described here and an actual text in a manuscript in the Bayerische Staats­bibliothek is suggested in a footnote to an article on the Ars notoria by Jean Dupebe.15 In the 1990s, independent discoveries of several more manuscripts (by Sylvie Barnay in France, and myself and Nicholas Watson in Ontario )16 show that the Liber florum did not in fact come to the abrupt end that one might have been tempted to assume from the Chroniques account. Indeed, the work contin­ued to be copied and used through the fifteenth century, largely in a monastic context, the latest known manuscript dating from the early sixteenth century.17 We are now aware that there are two surviving authorial versions of this text.18 The earlier version (or \"Old Compilation\"), which John completed between 1310 and 1313, culminates in a Book of Figures that may have incorporated as many as ninety-two figures to go with the prayers, probably intended to be used in simi­lar fashion to the notae of the Ars notoria. Unfortunately, most of these are not included in the only known Old Compilation manuscript.19 In the later version (or \"New Compilation\"), dated 1315, John completely rewrote the text of the Book of Figures and cut the number down to eight: seven iconic images of the Virgin and one image of an apocalyptic Christ. In my own contribution to this volume, I look at the way John casts the rela­tion between the Old and New Compilation texts as parallel to the relation be­tween the Old and New Testaments; his own Old Compilation is, like the Old Testament, superseded by the new work, which is its fulfillment; but the Old Compilation nevertheless remains sacred in its own right. I go on to compare the Liber Jlorum with another work that, in one version at least, makes similar claims related to the idea of sacramental supersession: the Liber iuratus Honorii."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1M Liber iuratus Honorii or Sworn Book of Honorius INTRODUCTION 7 As it turns out, the Sworn Book of Honorius, previously known only through the wrsion found in a handful of manuscripts in the British Library, is extant in ..other version as well, as reported by Jan Veenstra in chapter 4 of this volume. 1his newly discovered version is witnessed in a manuscript of the Summa sacre .agice, a massive compilation of magic texts circUlating in Spain that was com­piled in the first half of the fourteenth century by a redactor named Berengaria Ganell Like most of the works in this volume, the Summa sacre magice has Gilly recently been found worthy of examination.20 Veenstra's analysis of the Ganell version demonstrates conclusively that it belongs to a different tradition of redaction-a tradition clearly prior to that in the English manuscripts that were, until now, the only known witnesses of the text. The date of origin of the s..mt Book has not been pinpointed with certainty (in fact, Veenstra's discover­irs have overturned some of what was thought to be known about it), but cir­cumstantial evidence still points to the early fourteenth century, certainly for lhe London version and perhaps fo r the earlier one as well.21 Like the Ars notoria, the Sworn Book is fundamentally concerned with seek­Dig heavenly knowledge from angels, though what is sought in this case is not knowledge couched in the hierarchical structure of the seven liberal arts but nther a transformative vision: it claims that its ritual will induce a vision of God. face to face, as Adam and the Prophets saw him. It opens with a reference 10 the \"greate name of God which the Hebrues call sememphoras which dothe consyst of 72 ... letters.\"22 John of Morigny, too, refers to the \"Semhemphoras:' BJossing it as a Hebrew word meaning \"most elect name of God\" and noting il: as another term for the tetragrammaton. 23 This much was common currency for educated Christians from the works of Jerome and Isidore. The reference to tbe name of seventy-two letters, however, was not a patristic commonplace, and it seems to derive from some more direct contact with Jewish tradition.24 The seventy-two-letter name referred to here, together with a number of other as­pects of the text, show that the master of the Sworn Book was drawing con­sciously, though not always in a fUlly informed way, on ritual information fr om non-Christian Abrahamic traditions. Katelyn Mesler develops the relations between Jewish, Christian, and Islamic clements more fUlly in chapter 3, which maps out the interreligious aspects of tbe text by identifying specific aspects ofJewish and Islamic angelology that are discretely traceable in separate sections of the book. I will note here only that all of these angel magic texts (the Ars notoria, the Liber iuratus, and the Liber jlorum) seem to show certain generic family resemblances to a group of texts marking an early phase of Jewish mysticism known as the Hekhalot (from the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 INVOKING ANGELS Hebrew for \"palace\" or \"temple\") literature. Emerging between the third and eighth centuries, the Hekhalot texts deal with the ascent through the heavens of postbiblical figures to visit the heavenly temples, to \"behold the King in his beauty;'25 to obtain revelatory knowledge (often of the Torah), or to gain special magical powers (deriving from or connected to a new mystical knowledge of the Torah}.26 While it is increasingly clear that the Ars notoria and its avatars are not de­rived from Hebrew texts and show no direct influence of the Hekhalot litera­ture, 27 they nevertheless clearly have essentially similar mystical goals. Within the Hekhalot traditions, as in the Ars notoria, a strengthening of memory, wit, and other intellectual faculties may be sought to arrive at the vision of God; similarly, too, all knowledge is understood to be of a piece with knowledge of God and, as such, as deliverable by God, as seen in biblical precedents (Adam, Moses, Solomon, etc.). For example, it is suggested near the beginning of the Hekhalot Zuhtarti: \"When Moses ascended to God, he taught him as follows: If anyone finds that his mind is becoming confused ... recite over it the follow­ing names: In the name of ... let my mind grasp everything that I hear and learn, be it Bible, Mishnah, learning, halakhot, or haggadot. Let me never forget anything in this world or the next.\"28 With the Ars notoria, the aim is similarly to strengthen the faculties to climb the ladder of the liberal arts to theology­that is, the four senses of scripture. The form of the work posits, at least implic­itly, a transit through the angelic realms (an association clarified further in John of Morigny's revision), where knowledge of theology is the culminating phase of a journey in which all knowledge is ultimately seen as of a piece with theology, the beginning and ending place of intellectual activity.29 While all of the medi­eval Christian angel magic texts share a collection of essentially similar attitudes and mythohistorical elements, it is in the Liber iuratus, in the London version, at least, that we have the clearest indications of a conscious attempt to draw upon Jewish precedents in its construction of the ritual. Liber Razielis (Book of Raziel) and Liber de essentia spirituum (Book of the Essence of Spirits) But if the Sworn Book of Honorius shows evidence of Jewish and Islamic influ­ence, the question remains: where might this influence have come from? One source is probably commerce with living adherents of the Jewish and Islamic faiths; but this would not necessarily get the master of the Sworn Book any closer to records of their textual traditions. Few medieval Christian writers probably had much working knowledge oflanguages outside Latin or their own vernacu­lars (it seems doubtful, at least, that the master of the Sworn Book was a skilled"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 reader of Arabic or Hebrew).3° Those few who did command several languages, however, were encouraged to spread knowledge through translation. Spain was a particularly rich area of linguistic interconnection and therefore a rich source of translations from Arabic and Hebrew into Latin. Thus it is of interest that Veenstra seems to suggest Spain as a potential place of origin for the Sworn Book. As to textual sources of these traditions available in Latin, Sophie Page's chap­ter in this volwne offers a comparative descriptive study of two texts of spirit invocation, the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spirituum, which derived, respectively, from Jewish and Islamic milieux and circulated in Latin in the later Middle Ages. Both of these texts are understudied. There is so far no edition of the Latin Liber Razielis, and no study comparing the Latin text with the Hebrew edition of this work. Page herself discovered and edited the only known copy of the Liber de essentia spirituum. 31 Both texts are important, however, in recasting elements of Jewish and Islamic traditions for Christian consumption. We know that the Latin Liber Razielis originated as a translation of an older Hebrew magic compilation that was commissioned in Spain in the court of Al­fonse the Wise. The mythohistorical premise of the text is that the angel Raziel (Hebrew for \"Secret of God\") appeared to Adam soon after the expulsion from paradise and delivered to him a book of magic revealing the mysteries of cre­ation. The Alfonsine version consists of seven books, putatively brought together by Solomon, and a number of appended magic works as welJ.32 Sometimes indi­vidual books from this compilation were circulated separately, and some were separately known, like the Liber Semhemforas, which is among the texts that seem have to been known to John of Morigny33 and is discussed by Veenstra in this volume in the context of the Sworn Book. The availability of the individual books and annexations to the Liber Razielis makes this compilation a likely con­duit for some of the evident Jewish influence noted on the theurgic texts dealt with in this volwne. The Liber de essentia spirituum is a text preserved only in one known, and seemingly incomplete, copy. Its date of origin remains uncertain, though it must have been circulating by the early thirteenth century as there is a suspicious and derogatory account of it in the writings of William of Auvergne, as Sophie Page notes in chapter 2. William's complaints notwithstanding, the topos that guides the prologue is a familiar one from Christian hagiography: the retreat to soli­tude in the desert. The author, about whom nothing is known except that he claims to come from Seville, castigates those who remain ignorant of the per­fection from which their souls are descended. During his time in the desert he received an image of\"true light\" from his communion with spirits, and it is this divinely received knowledge that he passes on in the book. 1he problem ad­dressed by the revelation is also familiar, as the author seeks to explain why the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"10 INVOKING ANGELS incorruptible first essence is also the creator of (and contained within) diverse, imperfect, and corruptible things. The work goes on to discuss the levels of in­termediary spirits between God and man, and the spirits' degree of passibility, hence potential to be influenced by man. The text breaks off before getting very far into practical instructions in the use of spirits; it is nevertheless interesting inasmuch as it adumbrates a philosophical underpinning for magic that is very friendly to theurgic principles. It may have contributed to some of the ideas re­ceived by Cecco dl\\scoli and Antonio da Montolmo in the fourteenth century. Antonio da Montolmo Antonio da Montolmo was a doctor and astrologer writing in the second half of the fourteenth century; his Book of Occult and Manifest Things is extant in a single known manuscript in the Bibliotheque nationale de France. Prior to the edition in this volume done by Nicolas Weill-Parot (in collaboration with Julien Veronese), the work was little studied and had never been edited.34 Beyond the fact that Antonio's work constitutes an interesting synthesis of principles ex­tracted from a range of available magic texts, Weill-Parot notes that Antonio is one of the earliest authors of a magic book-that is, one of the first to write a book under his own name that openly professes to be about magic. As we have seen, medieval texts concerned with invocations of spirits tend either to be pseud­onymously ascribed to biblical or legendary authors (as with the Ars notoria, Liber iuratus, Liber Razielis) or else carefully to eschew magical terminology for their own operations (as with John ofMorigny). Antonio is one of the first writ­ers (after the important precedent of Berengaria Ganell) to lay claim to the pro­duction of a work of magic. Further, and perhaps more startling, by the word \"magic\" Antonio intends no safe or licit sense of\"natural magic\"; in fact, within the De occultis et manifestis, his use of the term \"magic\" exclusively designates actions with spirits. For those types of operation that might normally be thought of under the heading \"natural magic\" Antonio reserves the term \"astronomical\" or \"astrological.\" The book opens on a philosophical note, with Antonio remarking the transi­tory and disappointing nature of earthly life and describing the kind of knowl­edge that is desirable and necessary for eternal life. He cites Aristotle to the effect that the p_erson loves God who devotes himself to speculation, and adds that it is better to engage in contemplation of noble things than base ones. Intelligences, Antonio suggests, are created with knowledge and nobility; therefore, as noble things, they are appropriate objects of contemplation in accordance with the harmony and course of nature. Keeping an eye always on the natural aspect of his subject matter, Antonio shies away from mysticism; unlike the author of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 Libn' de essentia spirituum, he vaunts no divine revelations but merely indicates that he is going to describe what is known of the theory or \"universal rules\" of operations with spirits. To do this, Antonio folds together in his synthesis two types of sources: on the one hand, the astrologically oriented kinds of works that were often ascribed 110 Hermes (and that modern scholars therefore often refer to broadly as Her­llldic texts), whose primary conduit was translation from Arabic sources; and ... the other, the works deriving from the Judeo-Christian tradition, constructed from endogenous Latin liturgies and often ascribed to Solomon (and therefore broadly referred to as Solomonic texts). Antonio gives a rough guide to spirit summoning that references both types of operation, noting that the most pow­aful actions implement both magical and astrological principles. Antonio's work is interesting in its justification of magic through philosophical means; he brings together a spirit cosmology derived from a broad array of contemporary magic texts and does his best to pin the often confusing and contradictory as­pects of his sources to an idea of universal natural laws. In his adoption of the word \"magic\" for something he would do himself, as well as in his theoretical md philosophical approach to the information he gleans from the magic texts be knows, he marks a step toward the author-magicians of the early modern period. Rlmron Llull Many better-known writers were also engaged in projects that aimed to reduce diverse cultural phenomena to universally applicable laws. Both Ramon Llull, the Catalan philosopher and mystic (1232-1316), and Johann Reuchlin, the Ger­man philologist and Christian kabbalist (1455-1522), distinguished themselves in different ways by seeking universal shared principles by which those of other faiths could be united under a Christian banner. Both of them also have been associated with kabbalistic ideas. In Llull's case, the association is post facto, as Llull never claimed any associa­tion with Kabbalah; however, the term is associated with his work as early as Pico della Mirandola, who, in discussing a certain type of Kabbalah, said, \"that which is called hohmat ha-zeruf[revolution or combination ofletters] is a com­binatory art and it is a method fo r gaining knowledge, and it is similar to that which we refer to as the ars Raymundi, although it proceeds in a very different manner.\"35 Llull's combinatory art, which he reworked over time, comes in both long and short versions and involves circular figures that reveal different pos­sible combinations of principles represented by letters of the alphabet; the Ars brevis, or brief form of the art, has an \"K figure, a \"T\" figure, and two additional"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"12 INVOKING ANGELS figures, one using a revolving wheel to allow different combinations to be made among the base principles.36 On the basis of the alphabetical meditations in­volved in these figures, as well as other suggestive similarities to practices of ecstatic Kabbalah, scholars have been arguing for decades about whether Llull's apparent kabbalistic affinities were the conscious result of real exposure to Jew­ish mystical sources or a more or less accidental result of his endogenously re­ceived Neoplatonic tendencies. The most recent extended argument for the pos­sibility of a real kabbalistic influence on Llull is made by Harvey J. Hames in his book The Art of Conversion, which examines Llull's work against the multi­cultural conversations taking place in late medieval Barcelona, where Christians and Jews frequently came into contact. Whether or not Llull consciously employed kabbalistic methods, it is of in­terest that both Christians and Jews associated his work with Kabbalah. Hames has uncovered a fifteenth-century translation of Llull's Ars brevis into Hebrew, and he discusses this translation in chapter 7 of this volume. The translation, which apparently circulated among Jewish scholars in Fico's circle, attests to considerable Jewish interest in this Christian text, which surely derives at least in part from the fact that Llull's own concerns were already intercultural and universalizing. Llull intended first and foremost to facilitate conversion to Chris­tianity by showing that the inherent nature of the supreme being was demon­strable through general principles acceptable to all three monotheistic faiths; these universalizing principles, however, seem to have made the Ars brevis palatable to its Jewish audience, who felt from it no clear pressure to convert. Hames reads the colophon of this translation to show how the work's translator associates it with the mors osculi (\"death of the kiss\" or \"death by kiss;' a term current in kab­balistic literature deriving from a Hebrew commentary on the Song of Songs), and explores the implications of this translation in the works of the Jewish writer Yohanan Alemanno. Johann Reuchlin The sixteenth-century German philologist Johann Reuchlin had an explicit in­terest in Kabbalah and the linguistic abilities necessary to make a genuine study of it. He had taught himself both Greek and Hebrew and was an admirer of the Florentine Nf!oplatonists with whom the Medici family surrounded themselves; the resuscitation of ancient learning appealed to him, and he was a follower of Pico della Mirandola. Reuchlin is responsible for two works that incorporate or depend on ideas found in the kabbalistic literature at his disposal, De verbo miri­.fico (1494) and De arte cabalistica (1517). The latter work was addressed to Pope Leo X, son of Lorenzo de' Medici, who was famous fo r (among other things) his"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 love oflearning and had been schooled in the Florentine academy. In the decade between 1510 and 1520, Reuchlin became embroiled in difficulties in Cologne, where he ran into conflict with the Dominican inquisitors for failing to side with them in propounding the need to burn Jewish books. Reuchlin's address to Pope Leo of this work on Kabbalah was evidently in part a bid to win his favor in the case by showing the applicability ofkabbalistic literature to Christian concerns.37 Clearly Reuchlin's use of Jewish ideas had strategic elements, and it is not to be expected that his readings of Hebrew texts would line up precisely with those of Jewish interpreters. But what was the real depth of his understanding of the kabbalistic works he had encountered? Was he pushing their sense out of shape or out of context, whether deliberately or inadvertently, to uphold a Christian message? In chapter 8 of this volume, Elliot Wolfson argues that Reuchlin un­derstood the kabbalistic texts more deeply than is sometimes supposed. In a deli­cate reading of Reuchlin's two kabbalistic works, Wolfson examines Reuchlin's use of his Hebrew sources. He notes that Reuchlin does not escape the anti­Semitic presuppositions of his time-like all Christians, he tended to read Jewish texts in terms of supersession theology-but also that Reuchlin sees and de­ploys strong messianic threads that run through the kabbalistic writings, and that he does so in sensitive ways. In Wolfson's words, he \"astutely understood the intricate weave of prophetic visualization and eschatological salvation that had long characterized the mystical ideal proffered by kabbalists .... Reuchlin's messianic interpretation of kabbalistic symbolism is not contrived or imposed from without:' As was the case with both Ramon Llull and his Hebrew translator, a univer­salizing view of alternate esotericisms seems to be in play in Reuchlin's work-a desire to take learning into the realm of a deeper truth that may be manifest in the religious practices of one's neighbors. But Reuchlin pursues this desire through a genuine and learned engagement with Hebrew texts. Whatever escha­tological presuppositions Reuchlin may have had about the role of the Jews or the superseded nature of their ceremonies, he took their learning very seriously indeed. Humphrey Gilbert The sixteenth century witnessed an interest in the augmentation of knowledge of many kinds: the pursuit of linguistic, philosophical, and mystical studies into uncharted territories was contemporaneous with explorations of the geographi­cal world beyond its familiar perimeters. Humphrey Gilbert, colorful halfbrother to Sir Walter Raleigh, is a figure well known to historians for his military service to Queen Elizabeth, his Discourse on the Northwest Passage, and his adventurous"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14 INVOKING ANGELS explorations of the New World. He is fo dder for the popular imagination as well, and his adventures at sea have inspired a number of fictional or semifictional works, including a poem by Longfellow, a nineteenth-century children's story, and two novels of speculative fiction. 38 For all his adventurous appeal, however, Gilbert's spirit-summoning diaries have had much less coverage. They occasion­ally garner brief fo otnotes in works on the more famous occult writings and practices of Dr. John Dee, and often go unmentioned in the popular and schol­arly histories of his explorations.39 Unlike Gilbert's Discourse on the Northwest Passage, which seems to have been almost continuously in print since the six­teenth century, the diaries have never been published. In chapter 9 of this volume, Frank Klaassen offers the first real analysis of this British Library manuscript in which the crystal-skrying and spirit-conjuring operations are recorded. Gilbert performed these experiments along with sev­eral other figures in his household-a group that included not only Gilbert's brother Adrian but also a young John Davis, later to become the prominent Elizabethan navigator and arctic explorer. Their story, as Klaassen gleans it from the pages of their diary, opens an interesting and informative window into the lives, thoughts, and fantasies of these Elizabethan gentlemen. Their crystal-skrying operations are contemporary with the better-known angel conversations of John Dee, which serve as a useful comparison. Both Dee and Gilbert had scientific interests that they pursued with the same zeal they brought to their conjuring experiments, but Dee seldom admitted to resorting to medieval tracts of magic of either demonic or angelic kinds (despite having many such books in his library). The Gilberts, however, recorded a systematic pursuit of practices found in medieval grimoires for speaking with demons and angels. The records made of their operations show both the free-form use of these materials and the extreme care with which they documented their vision­ary results. Klaassen positions the skrying operations of the Gilbert household in the context of their more widely known activities in the service of science and education, examining their anti-Scholastic attitudes and experientially focused methods against the background of the social and intellectual history of ritual magic and early modern science. The very difficulty of trying to categorize the Gilberts' experiments-as theurgy, science, mysticism, or magic-shows how futile it may be to begin with a framework set up by such categories. Yet it is crucial for historians to be aware of the ki�ds of polemics that have been engaged in the vicinity of terms like \"'mysticism\" and \"theurgy\" (and probably the term \"science;' too), especially as these may have operated around texts of Christian angel magic. In what fo llows, I take some time to tease out the implications of one particularly important term fo r this book: theurgy."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"D. Theurgy: Orientations and Definitions INTRODUCTION 15 I note that not all of the authors contributing to this volume use the word -.:heurgy\" to refer to the mode of religious activity in their sources, but many do. I note, too, that usages may differ from one essay to the next. I have not imposed any single standard of definition or usage, although I have tried to ensure that all terminology is made clear in the specific context where it appears. However, I want to devote some space to an unfolding of this term here in my introduction, because it seems crucial that readers be able to position themselves quickly in relation to these different usages-whether pro-theurgic, anti-theurgic, modern, or late antique. The intellectual history of discussions of theurgy, within and out­side Christianity, is long and complicated. The history of applications of the word �eurgy\" to the kinds of texts under discussion here is relatively short term; but it is all the more important to lay the groundwork for a set of relations between these ancient and current understandings of the term, because the questions that arise around them are crucial to the narrative arc that, in one way or an­other, informs all the essays in the book. Definitions of Theurgy A Greek compound that translates literally as \"god work; the term is used in late antique philosophical writings in apposition with \"theology\" (\"god speech''). As Georg Luck puts it, theurgy was \"an activity, an operation, a technique, dealing with the gods, not just a theory, a discussion, an action of contemplation:'40 Even in its original late antique context, the term \"theurgy\" suffered from much the same kind of problematic construction as the word \"magic,\" and the two words have always had somewhat overlapping semantic fields.41 In turn, theurgic prac­tices, sometimes condemned and sometimes defended, became a topic of philo­sophical conversation and argument among the Neoplatonic philosophers.42 In addition to the historical! ethnographic sense of the word \"theurgy\" in use by scholars attempting to reconstruct its original late antique contexts, 43 the word has other senses in common use. Some further senses of the word in mod­ern (mostly scholarly) contexts include its use (1) very loosely as a rough and ready synonym for \"magic\";44 (2) in a slightly stricter theoretical sense as a term fo r a \"special branch of magic\" that is \"applied to a religious purpose\" (the defi­nition perhaps too influentially formulated by E. R. Dodds);45 and (3) in a looser etic sense to refer to practices analogous (but not necessarily related) to the late antique Neoplatonic contexts in which theurgy originally comes up; in this sense, it has been adopted by some scholars of medieval Kabbalah, and more lately by some scholars of medieval Christian ritual magic. 46"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"16 INVOKING ANGELS I note here three elementary structural traits of the types of rituals that seem to be recognized in most contexts of the term's usage, whether positive or nega­tive. At a basic level, theurgic operations (1) tend to involve rituals to effect the soul's purification; (2) tend to involve fe llowship with intermediary beings (gods, angels, daemones); and (3) tend to be oriented toward revelation, or experiences in which something is transmitted by the divine powers. In practice this means that they may induce visions.47 I mark these traits only as broad generic aspects of rituals that get called \"theurgic:' They are not part of any definitive or essen­tial early definition of theurgy (there is none); they are merely my own abstrac­tions from a broad variety of contexts in which I have seen the word used. In the past, I have used the term \"angel magic\" to refer to medieval Christian texts, such as the Ars notoria, that have these generic traits, and I will continue my occa­sional use of the term \"angel magic\" as well. It should be noted that these traits are functional, not theological; when theurgy is defended or justified in theological terms, diff erent ideas come into play-for example, the idea that theurgy is necessitated by the weakness of the soul, or by the flawed perception of the soul in an embodied state, or by the idea that specific ritual practices are part of God's plan, instituted by God to effect the human soul's return. The concept that theurgy names certain ritual practices justified by divine institution is key in the Iamblichean defense of theurgy, just as it is fo r ideas of sacramental action in the Christian tradition as informed by the pseudo-Dionysius. These theological assoCiations are, in turn, a primary reason fo r Julien Ve ronese's adoption of this term to label the form of religious activity in the Ars notoria. Christian 1heurgy and the Ars notoria According to Julien Yeronese Veronese has a carefully explicated rationale fo r his use of this ancient term to refer to a medieval Christian practice, and it is worthwhile to reiterate some of his main points. 48 He writes: Recourse to the notion of \"theurgy\" to grasp the mode of functioning and the nature of the Ars notoria is thus only a convenient means of extracting this addressative practice from the demonological complex put in place by medieval theologians, following Augustine, at the point where there is a question of signs addressed to superior intelligences outside a framework defined by the Church. As a methodological tool, it permits the creation, at the heart of the ensemble of ritual magic texts, of an objective distinc­tion which, without being inoperative in the Middle Ages, was not thought of or formulated in these terms during this period.49"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 17 In other words, the advantage of the term for Veronese is that it is not ernie-the semantic field he uses the term \"theurgy\" to cover is not, in fact, produced by the culture that he is addressing, though it has certain analogues that would have been recognizable to that culture. veronese is well aware that there may be pitfalls in attempting to map a set of high medieval practices onto a set of late antique ideas only notionally related to them, and he emphasizes that the analogy should not be pushed too far.50 He notes as well that the masters of the Ars notoria themselves attempted to frame their work with the term \"sacrament:'51 Veronese continues, \"On the conceptual level, and whatever the bishop of Hippo might say, the affiliation in nature be­tween theurgy and sacrament is incontestable. Jean Trouillard emphasized, for example, ... that if it is abstracted from all context, the notion of theurgy ... is closely akin to sacrament in its functioning, and prefigures, by instituting 'an operative symbolism destined to rouse the divine presence and power; the effi­cacy of Christian sacraments and particularly that of the Eucharist.\" 52 I would note, however, that while the idea of divinely instituted operative symbolism is important in Iamblichus's treatment of theurgy, this treatment sur­rounds the idea with a worked-out theology intended to argue for its necessity­a theology by no means universally accepted by Neoplatonic philosophers or by those who interpreted Iamblichus later. Thus the notion of\"theurgy\" cannot really be \"abstracted from all context\" without losing the very thing that makes it useful as a positive term. The affiliation between theurgy and sacrament lies not so much in any base abstract or essential idea of theurgy, as Trouillard sug­gests, but rather in the habitual means of theological justification of efficacious salvific rituals within theologies having a monotheistic framework. veronese concludes this section by suggesting that the analogy with usacra­ments\" should not be pushed too far, either; in fact, he believes that the masters of the Ars notoria were careful not to be too precise in their use of the term to describe the mystery of this ritual divinely received by Solomon. For one thing, as Veronese notes, Solomon, the pre-Christian receptor of the text, does not offer a point of origin that can be expected to map cleanly onto the notion of sacra­ments instituted during the lifetime of Christ (even though the names of Christ and the Trinity do occur in the prayers).53 Whatever may be the case with the Ars notoria itsel( however, the idea of sacrament does get linked with medieval texts of this genre in the medieval period in ways that are sometimes more explicit and distinctive. For example, Peter of Abano brings forward the notion of sacrament explicitly in his early justification of the Ars notoria, 54 while in roughly the same time period Thomas Aquinas explicitly declares that the Ars notoria is not divinely instituted and does not work like the sacraments of the church.55 And, as I note in my own essay in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"18 INVOKING ANGELS this volume, analogies with Christian sacramental theology are brought forward through the idea of covenant in two texts emerging somewhat later than the Ars notoria, but in same tradition: the Liber iuratus Honorii (which is coupled with the sacraments in my epigraph) and John of Morigny's Liber Jlorum celestis doc­trine. For good or ill, this is a th read that may often find itself woven into the tapestry of receptions and explanations of theurgy in the Middle Ages as well as other periods. Like Veronese, I see the utility of the term \"theurgy\" as a label for the prac­tices discussed in this book, in part because of the way the term both connects to, and remains distinct from, ideas of sacrament. Unlike Veronese, however, I find it of interest not because it escapes the demonological problems associated with the term \"magic\" but rather because, on the levels of historical analogy, theological justification, and scholarly reception, it engages them in a certain way. That is, the theological problems relevant to these texts are analogous to those that tend to surface around theurgy in both patristic and pagan writings, and they usefully illuminate the tensions that come into play around the texts and practices under discussion here. Christian 1heurgy and the Problem of Magic: Augustine and Dionysius As noted, the term \"theurgy\" has a long history of difficulty in Christian contexts­a difficulty that finds articulate expression in the works of Saint Augustine, who gave the anti-theurgic stance one of its most influential early formulations. While Augustine's general equation of theurgy and goetia (demonic magic) is often quoted-indeed, is a familiar topos of scholarship on the Christian anti­magical polemic-like many frequently iterated Augustinian ideas, it is not al­ways well understood. It is worth looking at the context of these statements in a bit more detail. In Augustine's writings, theurgy is discussed extensively in The City of God, taking up much of books IX and X, in the context of a discussion of the pagan Neoplatonist philosophers, who were, in general, very important to Augustine, who had apparently been instrumental in his conversion from Manichaeism,56 and whom he clearly continued to admire despite the critique he proposes here. Much of this section of the book in fact amounts to a close mapping ofNeopla­tonic thought onto Christian thought, at the same time showing up points of deviation where they occur. He notes that the need for mediators between the human and divine is acknowledged by both pagan Neoplatonists and Christian thinkers, and Augustine's arguments point in the direction that God intended us to have one mediator, Jesus of Nazareth-who was simultaneously human and divine-and the real and historical existence of this ideal mediator effectively"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 rules out any possibility that the angels would be intended to perform a media­tion leading to salvation. 57 The tenor of his argument thus suggests that he sees theurgy as a pagan attempt to achieve through angels an equivalent to the me­diation that Christians achieve through Christ. The primary claim about pagan theurgy that Augustine was refuting (or re­vealing as different from Christian lines of thought in the same area) was the idea that theurgy could access any effective kind of divine mediation. The spirits invoked and addressed could not be efficacious either fo r the process of the soul's cleansing or for its eventual salvation, both because they are not God and because they are not human. It should be noted that Augustine equates the \"gods\" of the Platonists with Christian angels and says that it makes no difference whether you call them \"gods\" or \"angels\" because the concept is the same rela­tive to the supreme God. His eventual equation of theurgy and demonic magic or goetia is thus really not a simple equation of pagan gods and Christian demons but a more complex argument about the philosophical assumptions underlying the theurgic spiritual cosmology. For Augustine, theurgy seems to imply a wor­ship of creatures, which at best amounts to angel worship, which misunderstands the true worship of God and of which the angels themselves could not approve. Moreover Augustine is unable to countenance the idea that angels might be sub­ject to conjuration or passible, \"perturbed and agitated by the emotions which Apuleius attributed to demons and men.\"58 If angels in their divinity must be seen as sharing the impassibility of the Godhead, the corollary is that any passible angels actually encountered by prac­titioners of theurgy must be demons; because of this, and making the most of unresolved queries about the nature of the beings described as accessible to theurgic techniques in Porphyry's \"Letter to Anebo:· Augustine maintains that theurgy in practice is not really distinguishable from goetia or (demonic) magic. Even though Porphyry agrees that theurgy might work some kind of purgation of the soul, according to Augustine, \"he does so with some hesitation and shame, and denies that this art can secure to anyone a return to God.\"59 In deference to the coherence of these objections, the Latin Christian tradition after Augustine eschews the Greek word \"theurgy\" except as the name of a demonic practice. A more positive idea of theurgia (if not the word itself) enters the Christian tradition by another route, however. The word theurgia and its compounds occur between fo rty and fifty times in the Greek corpus of the pseudo-Dionysius, roughly half of these in his liturgical commentary 1he Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. 60 Like Augustine, Dionysius dearly views God's incarnation as the most impor­tant act of mediation between humankind and God-the act by which human salvation was intended to be effected. Unlike Augustine's, however, Dionysius's terminology fo r this divine mediation is the terminology of theurgy. God's"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"20 INVOKING ANGELS incarnation, his entry into the world, is his original theurgy on our behalf61-a theurgy that is forecast in the Old Testament, consummated in the New, and represented and celebrated by the sacraments, which enable the imitation of God.62 We are initiated into these \"theurgic lights,\" grasping them \"in the best way we can, as they come to us, wrapped in the sacred veils of that love toward humanity with which scripture and hierarchical traditions [i.e., liturgies] cover the truths of the mind with things derived from the realm of the senses�63 In other words, instead of thinking of theurgy as a religious practice involving an­gels as divine mediators (as Augustine did), Dionysius thinks of theurgy simply as a practice involving divine mediation and adapts its application to Christ and the Christian liturgies. The difference between Augustine and Dionysius in regard to their terminol­ogy for Christ's mediation is perhaps most simply understood as a product of the fact that Augustine had a strong philosophical affiliation with Plotinus and does not reference Iamblichus at all, whereas the pseudo-Dionysius was appar­ently familiar with the works of lamblichus (the deft philosophical apologist for theurgy) and seems to have been influenced by him in his view of anagogical uplift, which he adapts for Christian use.64 Thus Dionysius was intimate with, and thought in terms of, an already fully theologized concept of theurgy as di­vine action, whereas Augustine did not. What is important, at least for the sub­sequent destiny of the term \"theurgy\" in medieval Christian culture, is that in the Latin translations of the pseudo-Dionysian corpus the word theurgia never appears: it is always rendered as some version of \"divina operatio\" or \"operatio Dei;'65 which medieval readers would not have recognized in the Latin trans­lations of this corpus as the same term equated with demonic magic, goetia, by Augustine. Iamblichean and Dionysian 1heurgy According to Gregory Shaw While this is a straightforward explanation of the absence of any positivized version of the word \"theurgy\" in medieval sources, it may do less to explain the continuing resistance to the word in scholarship throughout the modern pe­riod. This resistance is probably due not only to the power of Augustine's voice but also to the continuation of the problematics of theurgic rituals as at least potentially implying a passible Godhead-issues that Augustine was neither the first nor the last to finger. Scholars have shown a special discomfort in dealing with use of the term \"theurgy\" in the corpus of the pseudo-Dionysius because of the difficulty in divorcing this term, on the one hand, from its Augustinian as­sociation with goetia, and, on the other, from E. R. Dodds's similar but differently motivated association of Iamblichean theurgy with irrationality, superstition,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 and spiritualism. Successive generations of historians and classicists have at­tempted to shore up a set of essential theological distinctions between the theurgy described by Iamblichus and that espoused by Dionysius. Over the past two decades, however, these apparent differences between Dionysius and Iamblichus have gradually broken down, as scholars have gained an increasingly solid grasp, first, on the full extent ofDionysius's debt to lambli­chus, and second, on the fact that Iamblichus himself never espoused a-theurgy of human action upon God. Two landmark articles by Gregory Shaw have been useful in clarifying the way the problem of theurgy has emerged both histori­cally, in the late antique context, and historiographically, in the scholarly con­texts that have been built around it. In a 1985 article, \"Rituals of Unification in the Neoplatonism oflamblichus:' Shaw casts the first line through his argument about the nature of Iamblichean theurgy, not as a human action upon the gods but as a divine action divinely instituted by God to enable the human soul's re­turn to him. He also offers a historiographic overview of the gradual emergence of more positive and accurate ideas oflamblichean theurgy from the more nega­tive but still influential views propounded by E. R. Dodds in The Greeks and the Irrational in 1951. Shaw notes that Dodds was \"a lifelong member of Britain's Psychical Research Society and attended many spiritualist seances .... [Dodds} explains the sacred rites of Iamblichus' school by comparing them to modern spiritualist phenomena. For Dodds ... theurgy was the 'spiritualism' of Late Antiquity, and represented the corruption of Platonic rationalism with oriental superstitions:'66 This may overread Dodds's lack of sympathy for the irrational motivations both of spiritualism and of theurgy as he understood it; neverthe­less it remains true that Dodds's ideas about lamblichus as purveyor of \"magic applied to a religious purpose\" seem to have remained influential somewhat past the point of their greatest utility. In another important article, published in 1999, \"Neoplatonic Theurgy and Dionysius the Areopagite;' Shaw continues to refine his arguments about late antique theurgy, pulling together the issues already shown to be at stake in treat­ments of Iamblichean theurgy and showing how they have colored the reading of pseudo-Dionysius. 67 Summing up all the difficulties that have emerged around the Dionysian vocabulary choice, Shaw writes, \"If Dionysius practiced theurgy, it would present a serious challenge to his 'orthodoxy; for to have been a theur­gist in the Neoplatonic sense would condemn the Areopagite in the eyes of all scholar-apologists. It is not surprising, therefore, that his theurgy has been de­scribed by two leading Dionysian scholars, Andrew Louth and Paul Rorem, as fundamentally different from Neoplatonic, i.e. 'pagan; theurgy:'68 While Shaw makes a complex argument in this article, one of its central nodes is the overturning of Paul Rorem's distinction between subjective and objective"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22 INVOKING ANGELS genitives. Rorem suggested that Dionysius \"used the term 'theurgy' to mean 'work of God; not as an objective genitive indicating a work addressed to God (as in lamblichus, e.g. de My steriis I 2, 7:2-6) but as a subjective genitive meaning God's own work ... especially in the incarnation:'69 According to Shaw, this is a misreading, for even in lamblichus, theurgy is not a work addressed to the gods, either in the place cited or elsewhere; for Iamblichus, too, the subject of the ergon theou must always be God.70 In fact, \"Iamblichus clearly states throughout the De mysteriis that theurgy was not an attempt to influence the gods, not only because it would have been impious but impossible. Iamblichus is unambiguous on this issue precisely because the De mysteriis was written to address it.\"71 If there is no cogent reason for treating Iamblichean and Dionysian theurgies as being based on opposing theological principles, then the primary difference between them boils down, as I have noted earlier, to an understanding of what divine mediation must entail and the corollary location of symbolic liturgies in an arena suitable for commemorating the entry of the divine into the world. Following James Miller, Shaw points out that liturgical/theurgical symbols for Dionysius are no longer found in the natural world but in the ecclesiastical world: \"while Dionysius preserved the Neoplatonic dynamics of prohodos and epistrophe that are ritually enacted in Iamblichean theurgy, in its Dionysian form the natural cosmos is replaced by ecclesiastic and angelic orders. This means that Dionysian theurgy is no longer an extension of the act of creation (in analogia with divine creation) but becomes something beyond or beside nature, in what the Church calls the 'new creation': the supernatural orders of the Church and its angels.\"72 If Shaw is correct in his assessment of Iamblichean theurgy, his work would seem to lay to rest any idea that theurgy in the work of either of these important late antique thinkers involved a human attempt to manipulate or influence the gods. Yet it is pertinent to remember that the arguments laid out in Porphyry's \"Letter to Anebo;' against which Iamblichus and Augustine both so crucially reacted in their different ways, did embody a discomfort around the issue of the possibility that humankind could influence the divine. This problem is peren­nial and may not be subject to a final resolution. At the very least, the recurrent pitching of this accusation against those who defend a positive notion of theurgy suggests that we may not have seen the last of it. It is of !Jtterest to note, however, that in the current usage of some scholars of Jewish mysticism, theurgy is still taken to mean \"an operation intended to influ­ence the divinity\" -a usage conspicuously defined and adopted by Moshe Idel. Shaw sees this as a simple capitulation to Dodds's definition, but it is demon­strable that whUe it may begin in the same place, the definition goes beyond Dodds's in several ways."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Jewishness of Theurgy According to Moshe !del INTRODUCTION 23 In the scholarly discourse surrounding Jewish mysticism, the term \"theurgy\" is used in ways that are not always consistent, but they do all have one thing in common: the idea that theurgy is a component of a specifically Jewish religios­ity, alien to Christianity. Moshe !del's understanding of the word is elaborated at some length in chapter 7 of his Kabbalah: New Perspectives. Ide! argues against Scholem's assumption that '\"the ritual of rabbinical Judaism' was fr ee of myth and mysticism, which were infused into it by the kabbalists:'73 Rather, he argues, \"theurgic\" tendencies have always been present in a certain stream of rabbinic Judaism. Crucial for my point is the emphasis upon the theurgical nature of the commandments, as against other significant ancient rabbinic tendencies that were indifferent to, or even opposed, this evaluation of the perfor­mance of the commandments. The term theurgy, or theurgical, will be used below to refer to operations intended to influence the Divinity, mostly in its own inner state or dynamics, but sometimes also in its relationship to man. In contrast to the magician, the ancient and medieval Jewish theurgian focused his activity on accepted religious values. My definition accord­ingly distinguishes between theurgy and magic far more than do the usual definitions. 74 In the footnote attached to \"usual definitions;' Ide! cites only Dodds.75 But Idel's definition is idiosyncratic not so much because, as he states, it \"distin­guishes between theurgy and magic far more than do the usual definitions;'76 but more because by \"theurgy\" Ide! does not primarily mean to indicate a set of ritual practices analogous to late antique theurgy. Rather, the word \"theurgy\" points, in !del's usage, first and foremost to an idea or proposition about God: the proposition that the divine is a dynamic entity in need of human action in order fully to inhabit its correct relation to itself. In the section of chapter 7 titled \"Augmentation Theurgy;' Ide! discusses the interrelation between human acts and the augmentation of the divine Dynamis ( Gevurah) as a key concept of rab­binic literature. Ide! focuses on the assumption present in certain classical Jewish sources that the power of God is weakened or diminished by human transgres­sion and augmented by the proper performance of the commandments; as an illustrative locus, he quotes the Pesikta de-Rav Kahana: ''Azariah [said] in the name ofR. Yehudah bar Simon, so long as the righteous act according to the will of heaven, they add power to the Dynamis .... And if they do not act [accord­ingly], it is as if: 'you have weakened the Rock that formed thee:\"77"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"24 INVOKING ANGELS The notion that the quantity of power or glory of divinity has a dependence upon human action, I del argues, is not a kabbalistic novelty but had always been present and integral to a certain stream of Jewish thought. For the kabbalists, however, the notion that humans could and indeed needed to influence intradi­vine processes was \"the Archimedal point for the articulation of a full-fledged theurgical theory that interpreted the performance of the commandments as necessary for the divine welfare:'78 More than once, Idel refers to this theurgic concept as \"mythic\" (a term that is necessary to his argument against Scho­lem).'9 In fact, however, in being a proposition about God, it is more essentially a theological than a mythic point. This definition of theurgy is shared with some scholars in the area of medieval Jewish Kabbalah, though others dealing with similar materials do not use the term at all, or seem to use it in more conven­tional or simply less well defined senses.80 As already noted, Shaw cites Idel as one of an array of scholars who have \"adopted Dodds' characterization of theurgy as an attempt to manipulate, influ­ence, or coerce the gods:'81 However, though !del does characterize theurgy as an operation \"intended to influence the divinity;' his idea is actually distinct from Dodds's inasmuch as his definition of \"theurgy'' is not a capitulation to a stream of practice that happens to exist despite rationalist proscriptions, but is rather a theological representation of the role of human religious action in relation to God's Dynamis. In fact, \"theurgy\" is not quite fully read as \"coercing\" or \"constraining\" the divine, because Idel quickly moves to the idea that this \"human influence\" on the divine is actually part of what he calls an \"intra-divine process\" -the implication being not that God is influenced by a humankind whose will and action are held to be external to him, but rather that God and humankind are both involved a single system. As Ide! uses the term, \"theurgy\" labels a conception of the human relation to God, which has always existed and which needs accounting fo r. He states that this \"theurgy\" is not a kabbalistic novelty but rather \"a continuation of authentic Rabbinic traditions\" that are \"or­ganic to Jewish thought:'821hus it cannot really be said that his notion of theurgy is nothing more than a reproduction of Dodds's. In one sense, it may be said that Idel positivizes the radical aspect of the theurgic idea from which others try to escape when they seek to justify it. In another way, however, Idel's definition of theurgy addresses, if idiosyn­cratically, a difficulty that everyone else sees, too: the difficulty of conceptual­izing the human relation to God that is implied by religious action when that action is conceived as necessary to anyone. For even if religious action is only necessary because human souls are weak, how could God be conceived as not wanting the return of every created soul? But also, how could God be conceived as wanting anything at which we ourselves could fa il?

But it is not a perfect resolution, inasmuch as, from either a Jewish or a Christian perspec­tive, it is evident that any human being can choose not to be saved-can break the commandments, live an impure life, and ignore all God's work on his behalf. There is bound to be occasional anxiety about the effect of these failures on a system in which God and humankind appear to be so closely linked. !del's source texts may suggest an anxiety about this that runs through Juda­ism. It must be recognized, however, that, save for putting his finger on this theo­logical anxiety, what he calls \"theurgy\" here remains distinct from what others have used the term to mean. A primary difference is that he does not, at least in this key locus, appear to refer to any of the structural indices I noted at the out­set that trigger use of the term \"theurgy\" in other contexts: purification, fellow­ship of angels, revelation. His understanding of what constitutes the \"organic\" Je wishness of the theurgic concept, then, also differs from what others have un­derstood by it. In order to understand the initial championing of theurgy as a quintessentially Jewish religious form, we need to revisit its beginnings in the work of Gershom Scholem. The Jewishness of 1heurgy According to Gershom Scholem Gershom Scholem.'s circumscription of the term \"mysticism\" in the first chapter of his landmark work, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, has in fact been a major influence on the way theurgy has been adopted as a defining character of Jewish mysticism-a character that has not changed despite the way this concept has been in many ways crucially reconfigured by Idel. Scholem.'s enterprise explicitly involves recuperating the domain of Kabbalah, on the one hand, from unsym­pathetic earlier historians who dismissed this \"magical\" literature with too little examination,83 and, on the other, from occultists like Eliphas Levi and Aleister Crowley, \"charlatans and dreamers'' whose magical sympathies did little to recu­perate its reputation as \"serious\" religion.84 Setting his own work as a scholar firmly apart from that of both antimagical and magical students of Kabbalah, Scholem begins by elaborating a concept of \"mysticism'' that he adapts to cover the Hebrew texts in which he is interested. Following Evelyn Underhill and Rufus Jones, Scholem begins by defining \"mys­tical religion'' as a \"type of religion which puts the emphasis on immediate aware­ness of relation with God:'85 Scholem goes on to distinguish Jewish mysticism from the Christian variety (as propounded by Jones and Underhill), first and foremost on the grounds that Jewish mysticism is not primarily interested in \"unio mystica\"; Jewish mystics are more apt to speak in terms of \"ascent of the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"26 INVOKING ANGELS soul to the Celestial Throne\" than of\"divine union:' If there are also Jewish apo­phatic mystics who do seem to be more interested in mystical union, according to Scholem this is \"the same experience which both are trying to express in dif­fe rent ways.\"86 Thus anagogical processes are elided with mystical union, which is a concept Scholem then allows to drop. As far as Scholem is concerned, in regard to Jewish mysticism, all paths were equally \"mystical\" insofar as their objective was some sort of \"immediate awareness of relation with God\"; but his immediate interest is in the stream that pertains to theurgy (understood within the boundaries of the functional sense outlined above). 87 Of course, Christian angel magic may also be accused of lack of interest in \"unio mystica\" (or, alternatively, of a positive interest in visionary knowledge), and there are a number of other features Scholem indicates as distinctively char­acteristic of Jewish mysticism that are shared by Christian angel magic too, in­cluding its trope of Adamic knowledge; 58 its positive view of the power of Ian­guage;89 the fact that it is typically written and practiced by men rather than women, and (connectedly, according to Scholem) the lack of any trace of affec­tive piety in it.90 Throughout Scholem's discussion, however, he also insists on the importance of configuring all mysticisms in their historical context. Because of this, the centrality of all these strands of Jewish mysticism is established-and has largely been construed since-as if it were part of a historical distinction between Christian and Jewish religion, rather than a difference between the way in which scholars of Christianity and scholars of Hebrew and Judaic studies have constructed the term \"mysticism\" -in the fo rmer case as excluding, and in the latter as including, theurgic practices. As the present volume shows, there is really no dearth of this sort of thing in medieval Christianity, but it has never been conceived or studied as part of the domain of \"mystical religion:' It was excluded from this category before Scholem ever adapted the term to cover Jew­ish theurgy. It is only beginning to be taken seriously enough to be studied at all. In fact, the situation from which Scholem endeavored to rescue the kabbalistic texts for serious study sixty years ago is very much parallel to that of medieval Christian theurgic texts until recently. At this point, as many scholars are recognizing the need for more serious ac­count to be taken of neglected or marginalized strands in religion, we may wish to think about broadening the study of Christian mysticism to include texts like the Ars no tori a, the Sworn Book, and the Liber jlorum of John of Morigny. If we do so, we are likely to find that some of the base criteria for what makes a mysti­cal text look Christian or Jewish will require further refinement. It may be added as well that there is surely room for this expansion in a field that has, since the time of Underhill, developed an increasingly nuanced understanding of what constitutes religious experience, and a more solid grasp on the role played by"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 27 devotional practices in focusing and interpreting such experiences.91 Since some of the theurgic apologetics already explored can be seen to have other or broader applications to the study of religion,92 it is to be hoped that by drawing attention to these aspects of a largely ignored medieval theurgy, this book will begin to open out new connections between these texts and the study of other forms of religious practice.

Thus it is probably less that Dodds's definition is \"usual\" than that it was all Ide! could find. 76. In fact, it continues to assume that magic is, by definition, \"not religious''; if there can be shown to be a theurgy that is consistent with religion, it must, by definition, be nonmagical.

Of course, it is possible that these Christian texts directly or indirectly took some influence from Jewish ideas; however, the pres­ence of these general characteristics (the preference of vision over divine union, the myth of Adamic knowledge, the valorization oflanguage) need not necessarily have been a result ofJewish influence. Even where this influence is to some extent demonstrable (as in the case of the Sworn Book), the texts seem not to have originated as translations or adaptations of Hebrew works but, as Jean-Patrice Bou­det puts it, as endogenous productions of Christian Latin culture.

In a recent contribution to scholarship, Jean-Patrice Bourlet laid the foundations for such a study, but his purpose was more to synthesize some basic questions and to put together the initial elements of an answer than to propose a thorough overview of what is still an almost virgin territory for research.4 The theme of his article is the sticky question of the real nature of the Ars notoria: should it be thought of simply as a \"magical\" art? Or might it still be possible to relate it (as in the preliminary hypothesis sug­gested by Jean Dupebe) to late antique Hellenistic theurgic practices, which were reintroduced to the West in the twelfth century via the Byzantine, Hebrew, 01' Arab worlds? Or again, might it be related to the devotional practices more mnsistent with Christian orthodoxy evident among mystics? Just how far can we travel down each of these paths?

In order to do this, a thorough consultation with the notory art's texts and variants is neces­sary at the outset. A more detailed treatment is available in my critical edition already cited; for the purposes of this essay I will refer to the most representative manuscripts and outline the means and ends at work in the notary art, starting with a description of the ritual and sketching out an analysis of the various ele­ments structuring it (following the approach used by Richard Kieckhefer in de­veloping his exposition of\"nigromancy\").5 To this end, an adequate text must be chosen. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into a detailed consideration of the avatars that have gov­erned the manuscript transmission of the Ars notoria, it is nevertheless appro­priate to give a short preliminary account of the situation. First of all, the Ars notoria has a solid manuscript base. At this point, more than fifty manuscripts have been discovered scattered through different libraries in western Europe and North America {not counting some modern editions), which is remarkable in more ways than one. It reinforces Claire Fanger's assertion that ritual magic, in its diverse forms, was not a marginal element in the cultural world of the liter­ate elite.6 Above all, it forces us to ask about the reasons for the persistence of this text despite the fact that the Ars notoria was duly condemned by Alexander of Hales, Thomas Aquinas, and numerous other doctors of the church afterthem.7 Do we have to see this simply as the ineffective repression of a phenomenon that had become too solidly embedded in the literate milieux (the milieux of cler­ics)? Or was there not, in fact, a certain offhandedness on the part of the institu­tions, confronted with a practice that was ambiguous by nature, which left the issue prey to doubt? The question has not been decided, although a comparison with other known types of ritual magic (notably the \"nigromancy\" of which a few late manuscripts still remain) weighs in on the side of the second hypothesis. In effect, if the demonic nature of \"nigromancy\" was evident (and so its eradication desired and largely put into action), the nature of the Ars notoria, objectively speaking, created more of a problem, as the Angelic Doctor had suggested. The reasons for the widespread diffusion of this practice are probably to be found, on the one hand, in this continual hesitation over the status of the Ars notoria, and, on the other, in its enticing goal {the acquisition of total knowledge). Some of the extant manuscripts have lacunae; others are complete. A critical study, although summary, permits two stages to be distinguished in the evolu­tion of the corpus of the Ars notoria. The first stage groups the texts based on an older model (from the thirteenth century or perhaps the second half of the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 39 twelfth century) of the kind that is found, for example, in the manuscripts Sloane 1712 (British Library), Yale 1 (Yale University Library), or Amplon. 4° 380 (Er­furt, Stadt-und-Regionalbibliothek). This version contains the two elements present in every complete text of the notory art: the Flores aurei followed by the Ars nova. It provides the operator with the large structure of the ritual and the principal elements that constitute it, but without really putting it into working order. (In other words, for the postulant who had no master to oversee his ini­tiation, this original, rather dry version gave insufficient directions to enable the easy or felicitous carrying out of the ceremony.) This is most probably why, at the end of the thirteenth century, a second version saw the light of day, very much fleshed out and glossed. Three magnificent fourteenth-century manuscripts provide examples: CC 322 in Kremsmiinster; Cues 216 in the Hospitalsbiblio­thek in Bernkastel-Kues; and lat. 9336 in the Bibliotheque nationale de France. If this version gives the operator a more clearly defined program, it also offers the historian a unique perspective, since it is not far from the original version and thus remains representative, but is also more rich in information. I base this chapter on this version (particularly as mediated by BnF, lat. 9336, on which my research has been focused, and which serves as a reference point throughout these pages) to give a full representation of the ritual of the notory art. The main contribution of this late version is its glossed part, superimposed on a base text that is still essentially faithful to the original stage of its elabora­tion. Quantitatively, the gloss represents a substantial piece of work. Two ways of looking at the situation are possible here: if the principal text is understood to be the text itself (Flores aurei and Ars nova) plus everything of a textual nature (the prayers and the lists of angelic names) included in the figures or notae, then the gloss counts for 43 percent of the whole contents of the manuscript, which is already considerable. But if we postulate that the texts inserted into the notae constitute a distinct piece of work (which is preferable, since they sometimes overlap with the principal text),8 then the principal text does not count for more than 30 percent of the treatise, as against 57 percent in the preceding example (the text of the notae counting for about 27 percent). The gloss appears suddenly as the largest subset of the treatise, which is explained in part by its repetitive structure (the recapitulations are numerous) but above all by its qualitative con­tribution. Indeed, it is occupied in a true exegesis of the text, bringing to it a density that it lacked at first. Let us consider some examples. Take the prologue.9 The base text delivers a succinct history of the revelation of the Ars notoria to Solomon and affirms its principal benefit: the acquisition of all forms of knowledge. For supplementary development of this revelatory epi­sode, the reader must draw on the abundant commentary in the margin. The"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 INVOKING ANGELS commentary begins by calling on Genesis to affirm the privileged place of hu­mankind in the creation-a process that serves to justify at the outset a practice in which the explicit objective is to reinforce the natural human aptitude for knowing. The notory art would not be able to work against the original divine plan since it does nothing but improve on a faculty that God gave to all human beings at the beginning of the world. The Ars notoria had thus been delivered to Adam, and then to others, in particular Solomon, who received from the hands of the angel Pamphilius, the principal minister of God, the Ta bulae aureae, on which were inscribed the angelic names and prayers constituting the notary art. In this way the foundational myth is established, and the author returns to this myth repeatedJy, occasionally with variations, throughout the treatise. After de­scribing the scene of its revelation, the author leaps forward in time and comes at length to the great disseminator of the art among men, Apollonius, dictus phy­losophus, the text's second great authority. At this point, after a brief presenta­tion of the work of Apollonius, and before the author even arrives at the first prayer with the incipit Alpha et omega, the last part of the commentary estab­lishes a few large principles that an operator who wishes to practice the Ars notoria successfully must follow and that will be reaffirmed again and again throughout the treatise (such as respect for the exigencies of timing and the need to lead a rigorous Christian life}. This is a good measure of the extent of the discrepancy that can exist between text and gloss. The prayer Alpha et omega10 provides us with a second illuminating example, since it describes a prototypical relationship between a prayer and its commen­tary. No specifications are given about Alpha et omega in the body of the text; to know its place in the ritual economy, the operator must refer to the gloss. The contribution of the commentary is very clear: it defines the method (doctrina) to be followed, establishing what must be done for the operation to proceed smoothly. Thus it specifies that Alpha et omega is to be recited twice, before and after the entire operation; that together with the prayers to come, it is part of a ritual intended to obtain a preparatory vision prior to which the general ritual does not truly begin-a vision that tells the beneficiary whether or not he is wor­thy to follow the operation through. Finally, the gloss describes exactly how the operator must prepare to obtain first the vision, then the divine \"open sesame\" necessary to go further in the ritual, the virtues of this prayer, etc.-elements that the text alone leaves to the free interpretation of each operator. For the sake of clarity, some preliminary details of the internal structure of the Ars notoria treatises need to be noted. Claire Fanger has already suggested the basis of such a study in an article in which she compares the structure of the Liber visionum (a revised version of the art composed by the Benedictine John of Morigny at the beginning of the fourteenth century} to that of a type of Ars"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 41 notoria treatise;11 however, we will set forth some further specifics, relying only on Latin manuscript 9336 of the Bibliotheque nationale de France. Even though it dates to the fourteenth century, this magnificent manuscript is a good \"con­ductive wire\" inasmuch as its text follows the text's original structure reasonably faithfully, although there are some modifications of detail from one manuscript to the next.12 These distinctions are necessary because the order in which the text is composed only apparently takes account of the order in which the ritual is performed. To reconstruct the order of ritual perf ormance, we must reestab­lish the internal play of textual correspondences when the time comes. As well, we must specify here and now-by a simple linear reading of the text-this first structure, which we will use later as a reference point. As we have seen, the prologue (fol. Ira) establishes the mythic history of the art and contains the first prayer, Alpha et omega. Then the real body of the treatise, the Flores aurei, begins: \"Here begins the first treatise of this most holy notary art and its expositions and restrictions of times, which Solomon and Appolo­nius called the Golden Flowers, and this work is proved and confirmed by the authority of Solomon, Manicheus, and Euducheus:'13 The Golden Flowers ends on fol. 13v and constitutes about three-quarters of the text (excluding the text of the notae). It is subdivided into multiple prayers, which all have one or more virtues. After a brief presentation of the Flores aurei, and especially Apollonius's work of translation (fol. tvb ), and after some warnings in the direct style on the part of Apollonius, a rubric announces our entry into the subject proper: \"The following division concerns the notory art. The art is divided in two parts. In the first part he puts the general prayers and notae; in the second, the specials:'14 lhis division corresponds, in effect, to the two su ccessive stages of the Flores aurei: first, the operator is delivered the prayers that permit the development and reinforcement of the intellectual faculties15 so that he may then be prepared to receive the sciences he desires to obtain, one after the other.16 The first or general part is subdivided into many sequences of prayers. One initial series, made up of tria prima capitulaP has the virtue of attracting the grace of God to the operator: \"These prayers have in them so great a mystery and virtue that in their pronunciation there is administered to the operator the grace of our lord Jesus Christ in each branch ofknowledge:'18 A second sequence of prayers, the triumphales orationes, serves to fortify memory and to develop doquence and intelligence.19 A third,20 a fourth,21 and a fifth22 sequence have the same goal. All must be recited at precise times laid out by the gloss. This rela­tively simple stratification occasionally becomes more complicated. As will be seen below, certain prayers, taken separately, actually have a specific virtue-used in this way, they do not develop the intellectual faculties but rather satisfy more circumstantial and prosaic desires. To put it as simply as possible, they have a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42 INVOKING ANGELS \"general\" utility, which is to ameliorate the fa culties of the operator, and a \"spe­cial\" utility, which is to respond to this or that circumstance of daily life (foresee the outcome of an illness, settle an urgent affair, etc.). The second part, which contains the orationes speciales, is subdivided like the first. It lays out all there is to know for the acquisition of total knowledge. The transition from the first part occurs on fo l. Sva. 23 After presenting the different arts of which the Ars notoria allows mastery, fo llowing a logical order, the trea­tise turns its attention to the arts making up the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic/ dialectic). It tells the number of figures attributed to each of the arts, 24 then specifies the manner in which the ritual of inspection of the figures must take place in each case.25 The treatise gives information on the months favorable to such operations26 and finally sets out a certain number of prayers that must be pronounced before the contemplation of the figures.27 The same operation is re­peated for the disciplines of the quadrivium (arithmetic, music, medicine, as­tronomy), 28 the figures called \"generals;'29 and philosophy and theology,30 and then a whole new sequence of prayers is laid out.31 For each art, the text, and especially the gloss, provides lengthy details about the conditions under which the figures should be examined. Thus concludes the Golden Flowers. The Ars nova {fols. 13va-15rb ) represents a break in the progress of the trea­tise. This treatise within a treatise was not delivered to Solomon at the same time as the Flores aurei; it was received after his disgrace as a sign of the restoration of the privileged link between himself and God in the best time of his reign.32 Thus the Ars nova marks a second phase in the mythic history of the Ars notoria, and on this account plays a slightly peculiar role. In fa ct, it is not indispensable to someone who already possesses the Flores aurei and the figures accompany­ing it; its absence would in no way hinder the appropriate progress of the oper­ation. Nevertheless, this short treatise (the evolution of which is mythically as well as historically ulterior to the notary art)33 has considerable importance. In fact, by itself it can suffice to see the operation through to its effect: thanks to its multiple benefits, it permits the short-circuiting of the interminable operation that precedes it: \"Even if you wish to work without the other chapters of the aforesaid art, you will be able to achieve great efficacy in any art whatsoever with these prayers said in a timely and orderly manner:'34 It is composed of only ten pray�rs35 and, above all, it fixes no temporal obligations: \"But in these prayers that must be said, neither times nor days nor moons need be observed.\"36 Even if it lays claim to its own autonomy, however, it is not less well integrated into the treatise as a whole for that reason. In a long extract from the gloss at the end of the treatise, a recapitulation of the whole ritual treats it as one step among others.37 The Ars nova undeniably has an ambiguous position."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 43 To conclude the text, there follow nine prayers called \"terminals\" (novem ora­tiones que dicuntur termini). 38 If it is certain that they do not make up part of the Ars nova, it is possible that they might have been separated by it from the re­mainder of the Flores aurei. 39 As with the Golden Flowers, Solomon received them from the hands of an angel when he was at the foot of the altar in the temple.40 These nine prayers consist of interminable lists of angel names, to which it is necessary to add two Latin prayers that do the duty of a prologue.41 The text closes with a long fragment of gloss that delivers some fundamental information about the ritual of the Ars notoria in general.42 It ends with the words \"Explicit doctrina operationum omnium figurarum totius summe istius artis memorative, Deo gratias, amen'' (Here ends the instruction for the working of all the figures for the entire summa of this art of memory, thanks be to God, amen). After the text come the notae, which conclude the whole treatise. The gloss defines the notae as follows: ''A note is the cognition of a certain thing through a prayer and a figure placed on top of it:'43 The note is the adjunct that permits the transmission of knowledge into the spirit of the operator at the final mo­ment of the operation, and is composed of text (oratio) and signs (figura). God gave to each art a well-defined number of notae. These are itemized from fol. 18r to fol. 28v. (It should be noted in passing that the order of folios in lat. 9336 is somewhat out of order in this location, most probably from the restoration of the binding.) Thus there are the three notes of grammar,44 the two notes of dia­lectic,45 the four notes of rhetoric,46 the single note of medicine and of music,47 the two and a half notes of arithmetic,48 the six notes of astronomy/astrology,49 the four \"general\" notes, 5° the seven notes of philosophy, 51 the two notes of ge­ometry, 52 the five notes of theology, 53 the note of chastity, 54 the note of justice, peace, and fear of God, 55 and finally the note of self mastery and silence. 56 This stratigraphic outline, necessary to establish a general framework, is nev­ertheless insufficient for a full grasp of the contents of an Ars notoria treatise. A reconstruction of the ritual is required at the outset, and then an analysis of its principal elements, which will allow us to respond in part to our general problematic. L Preparation Before the ritual begins the course of its first month, the operator must actively prepare himself over a period of fifteen days. 57 First he should confess and do penance, and then set about an operatio that will confirm whether he is worthy to pursue the procedure or not. Although the art is, in principle, open to all, this"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"44 INVOKING ANGELS testing, which takes the form of a magical manipulation, functions as a barrier: only the most zealous will be able to continue. At the beginning of the crucial fifteen-day period, the practitioner must find four olive, bay, or vine leaves and deposit them in a new glass cup in a clean place. The operation that concerns them can take place only during the last three days of this fifteen-day prepara­tory period, and these last three days must fall at all costs on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. On the first of the three days, namely, the Friday that precedes the new month (which will be the first month of the ritual), the operator must take the leaves out of the cup, put them in another container, and mix them with some saffron dissolved in rosewater. Then the operator should take out the first leaf, write the name Hagnadam on the bottom with a new pen, and set it on a clean table. This procedure is repeated with the three remaining leaves: on one, Merabor is to be written, on the next, Hamiladei, and on the last, Pesiguaguol. They must be placed, following the first leaf, on the table in this order. At this point the first glass cup must be filled with pure, clear water. The first of the four leaves must be dipped into it, rubbed until the name written on the bottom dis­appears, and then withdrawn. The same operation is performed with the other three leaves. When the mixture is ready, the operator devoutly drinks a little and recites these words for the first time: \"Bonitatem et disciplinam et scientiam doce me\" (Ps. n8:66). Then he drinks again and pronounces the same request, repeating the procedure four times to imbibe the virtue of the four angelic names that were dissolved in the water in the previous sequence.58 When this step is completed, he immediately begins to read the first prayers of the art, Alpha et omega, the tria prima capitula, and then, after a short interval, the ten prayers of the Ars nova and the nine \"terminals.\" This reading must be done in the prescribed order three times during the Friday: early in the morning, at terce, and at noon; but the water must not be drunk again at the time of the second and third reading sessions. During the course of the day, it is important to fast on bread and water, and nothing should be eaten until after the third reading. Early in the morning on the following day, Saturday, the operator must finish drinking the water, following the same procedure as before, then recite the same prayers at terce and noon. The fast must be observed and the operator cannot eat until the task is finished. However, he is no longer restricted to bread and water; he is allowed to eat Lenten food and he may drink wine in moderation (absque superfluitate et crapula). On the third day, Sunday, the same prayers should be read at the same times as on the preceding days, but this time the operator may eat meat and anything he likes once he has finished with the operation. The fast is no longer required, but it is replaced by other good works, notably the giving of alms to the poor"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 45 fo r the purpose of doing penance. Thus the first preparatory operation is com­pleted. The procedure is described similarly, but in a more elliptical manner, with several variants, at the beginning of the treatise, when the gloss comments on the prayer Alpha et omega. 59 There also it is a matter of reciting the same prayers for three days in order to induce a preparatory vision during sleep (in visione dormiendo). But the details are lacking, and several divergences aie particularly to be noted. On the first day, the bread-and-water fast must be observed; on the second day, the operator is allowed to eat Lenten food. So far everything cor­responds to the preceding description. But on the third day, although the fast is no longer necessary in the long version, it is continued in the shorter one. More­over, the short version makes no mention of the fifteen preparatory days or the preparation of the decoction and specifies only that the \"three days\" should cor­respond to the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday that precede the first month of the operation -one of the numerous internal incoherencies in the treatise that make its reconstruction more difficult. The operatio ends on the Sunday, but, depending on the calendar, some days may remain before the beginning of the month and can be put to profitable use. This is an opportunity to reread the preceding prayers, this time with no tempo­ral obligation. The operator should read them as often as he can, both during the day and at night. Although it is not necessary to prepare another decoction, anyone who aspires to a vision should keep absolutely clean from all mortal sin. If he is a student, he should go to school during this transition period and attend (audire) the course dealing with the material he desires to master by using the Ars notoria. The goal of this entire preparatory operation is that the operator should have an angelic vision telling him whether he is worthy to carry on and, if so, what results he can expect. If the vision reveals that the candidate is not apt, he should in no case persevere. Moreover, he should ask what sin he has failed to confess and do penance for it, after which he may perhaps undertake the en­tire operation again from the start. There is a final directive to which obedience is necessary in order for the procedure effectively to be carried out: the elect should not under any circumstances reveal the content of his vision. This secret is one of the guarantees of the operation's success: to break this rule greatly hin­ders the aspirant's chances. 2. The First Month The ritual as such begins on the first day of the new month. First, in the early morning of the first day a new decoction must be made, following the instruc­tions previously set forth, with four leaves freshly picked on which are inscribed"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"46 INVOKING ANGELS the same angelic names. The operator should drink from it four times, inter­spersing the reading of the psalm Bonitatem et disciplinam, etc., and then repeat the preceding prayers as often as he can, both during the day and at night, all day long. It is unnecessary to drink the water, and fasting is not vital. The treatise notes again that if the operator is a student, he should continue to attend the course that puts him in contact with the sciences he hopes to acquire. The op­eration of this first month is really no more than a prolonged repetition of the preceding phase. 3. The Second Month The beginning of the operation is identical: prepare the decoction, drink it four times, and recite the prayers in the prescribed order from beginning to end as often as possible day and night. But this process lasts only three days-the first three days of the second month, during which the operator is allowed to live normally. On the fourth day, in the morning, he must drink the decoction again, then recite cum humili pronuntiatione the following prayers: Alpha et omega, the tria prima capitula, and the six prayers that go from Assaylemaht to Te queso Domine. With this accomplished, the operator may go to study, but he must be back in the place where he performs the ritual (a house) to recite the prayers again before terce. He should recommence around noon and in the evening. The prayers should be repeated in the same way-that is, four times a day, the eighth day of the month (and not before), the twelfth, the sixteenth, the twentieth, the twenty-fourth, the twenty-eighth, and the thirtieth. These temporal prescriptions are in agreement with those given in the treatise for the six prayers (Assay­lemaht, etc.).60 So there is no contradiction between the gloss and the text: the gloss simply puts the text's prescriptions in a more coherent order. Moreover, on these eight favorable days, the prayers should be pronounced freely, without constraint, \"since the more times all the Latin prayers are pronounced, the more profit they bring:'61 4· The Third Month On the first �ay the operator must drink the decoction again, then in the early morning recite the prayers Alpha et omega, the tria capitula, Te queso Domine, and its prologue, Lamehc, Ragna, etc., Hazatam, etc. On the same day he must recite them at terce, noon, and nones, but with three repetitions each time. The operation is repeated in this way (without drinking the decoction first) on the third day of the month, the sixth, the ninth, the twelfth, the fifteenth, the eigh­teenth, the twenty-first, the twenty-fourth, the twenty-sixth, the twenty-ninth,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 47 and the thirtieth-that is, twelve days in all. For more details, the gloss refers to the text. For the duration of these twelve days, the frequency of the readings increases exponentially: \"Moreover, the prayer ought to be uttered once on the first moon, thrice on the third, six times on the sixth, nine times on the ninth, twelve times on the twelfth, fifteen times on the fifteenth, and ought to be ut­tered the same number of times on the eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-sixth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth moon-that is, fifteen times.\"62 Thus the prayers should be read as often as fifteen times in a single day. During the twelve days, the operator should follow a Lenten regime and indefatigably skim works deal­ing with the sciences he is trying to acquire. On the other days he does not cease to be active: until the fifteenth day, in the morning, at terce, and at noon, he should recite some other prayers63 without being obliged to fast the whole time; from the fifteenth day to the end of the month he recites a new sequence in the early morning.64 s. The Fourth and Final Month During the fourth and final month, the operator must proceed to the most im­portant operation of the Ars notoria: inspecting (inspicere) or contemplating the figures. For this, the most complete solitude is required (in domum secretam ). The operator has the right to retain only one servant or, if he not a confirmed practitioner, his teacher. On the first day he repeats, as at the beginning of every month, the operation with the four leaves and then he recites a group of prayers. 65 Only then does he recite the prayers pertaining to each figure (remember that a nota is the association of prayers and one or more figures) and examine the fig­ures, for each of them attending to the prescriptions laid out throughout the treatise.66 This very demanding ritual requires the operator's full availability. The pro­cedure to be followed for the other sciences differs little: in each case the opera­tor must read certain invocations a certain number of times before contemplat­ing this or that figure or figures. The differences are in the details and concern the invocations to be recited, the auspicious times for the performance, and so on. If, on the whole, the Ars notoria ritual is very strict, certain prayers extracted from the context of the whole do not always exact rigorous conformity with all the prescriptions listed above. For the practitioner, it is a question of obtaining benefits answering to this or that circumstance of daily life while distancing himself from the primary objective of the notory art. So, with a particular usage of the prayers Lamehc, Deus summe Deus, and Te queso Domine, he can obtain a gift of clairvoyance67 that permits him to know what dangers lie in wait and to have news of someone dear to him. Of course, it is not a question here of resorting"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48 INVOKING ANGELS to those traditional means of divination that the Ars notoria permits one to ac­quire elsewhere (geomancy, chiromancy, etc.) but of obtaining a prophetic vi­sion delivered with the consent of God. For this, the operator should first cleanse himself of sins by confession and fasting. The operation takes place in the eve­ning: it consists of reading the tria prima capitula once and then immediately reading the three prayers mentioned above twice. Then the vision follows, after a set of gestures whose extreme simplicity contrasts with everything that has pre­viously been described. From a theological point of view, the Ars notoria is clearly on shaky ground at this point. From an orthodox perspective, a prophetic vision is a rare and pre­cious gift that is granted only to the best Christians and, above all, cannot be mechanically induced. Our treatise certainly means to show itself aware of this opinion. Doesn't the operator have to prove his holiness by confessing, fasting, and reciting prayers with great piety on the day he decides to obtain the vision? And how could he constrain God to respond to him unless he used a liturgy that God himself revealed and that aroused his sympathy? But despite this sort of legitimizing discourse, the break with orthodoxy could hardly fail to be serious. From the perspective of the operator, the art establishes a theurgic rapport with divinity-God is not constrained to satisfy the will of the operator, since the means used by the practitioner originate with God himself, and all he has to do is to reactivate them to excite the divine sympathy-something that has an equivalent, if imperfect, in sacramental theology68 and that allows the art to slip by under a veil of respectability. But from an orthodox perspective, such a rap­port can only be magical, since nothing can absolutely guarantee the presence of God but the sacraments themselves. If the art succeeds in satisfying adepts, this can only be through the intervention of demons. Another prayer, another practice. Like the preceding prayers, Iesu Dei Filius grants knowledge of the future, but this time for \"medical\" ends.69 The goal once again is to induce an angelic vision that delivers a reliable response to a question. Will the patient be cured or die? Is your wife pregnant and, if so, what will the child's sex be? Or will there be twins? Is the young girl about to be married a virgin? These are the questions to which the art guarantees answers without re­course to the traditional methods of divination or the sorcerer's oracles. It turns an extraordinary prophetic gift to ordinary ends. In this regard, Jean Dupebe emphasizes that \"contrary to 'orthodox' prophecy, which does not pretend to announce anything but great and lofty truths, theurgic vision does not disdain small daily curiosities:'70 As in the preceding case, the procedure is extremely simplified: all you have to do is put yourself in conformity with God, stand near to the sick person, the pregnant woman, or the young girl, and recite the invo­cation thrice in a low voice without regard to day or time. An angelic vision de-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 49 dares to the one praying what is going to happen or what truth should be trusted. It must be noted, on the one hand, that the operator performs this short ritual in the presence of strangers, which is counter to the customary injunc­tions of the treatise, and, on the other, that this prayer does not deliver the whole of medical knowledge-for more knowledge in this area one must follow the general ritual. A last case concerns the prayer Gemoht, Gehef.71 Used in the framework of the general ritual, it has the power of reinforcing eloquence. But a more re­stricted use permits it to resolve all sorts of business (negotium), notably when one has to face a judge in a court case, or a king, or any other personage. For responding to these risky situations necessitating quick reactions, the operator must know the prayer by heart or have it within reach on a small bit of parch­ment. He should recite it secretly with great devotion just before he goes to at­tend to his business. Then, by the power of the holy names of angels contained in it, the prayer resolves, as if miraculously, all difficulty. In order for the prayer to have any effect, however, the operator must be dean from all sin at the time he pronounces it, and he must have fasted on bread and water the previous day. This last constraint limits its use somewhat, as only situations known about in advance can be resolved. Coming to the end of this summary of the Ars not aria ritual, one can hardly fail to be struck by its extreme strictness. Its spirituality has an essentially monastic quality involving ascesis (detachment from the world), on which we will touch briefly before taking a more in-depth look at the ritual. As necessary as the pre­ceding summary may be, a more particularized study of the different constituents of the art (Latin prayers, divine and angelic names, notae) is required in order to respond to our initial problematic. A Christian Art 1. Having Faith The practice of the Ars notoria requires a true profession of faith. Success can be achieved only by one who shows an indestructible faith in God, one who lives in love of God at every moment.72 By corollary, if the art turns out to be ineffective after all, this is most probably occasioned by doubt on the part of the practitio­ner.73 Faith, to which charity and hope are equally attached, is the cardinal virtue that permits the sacramental power of the Ars notoria to be reactivated when­ever necessary (that is, each time the ritual is begun). It assures the presence of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"50 INVOKING ANGELS God at the moment of ritual engagement. Indeed, the notory art defines itself as a divine sacrament that effectively functions ex opere operata (by its own power); the practitioner only has to believe in it and in its creator to accomplish the work. 1his requirement makes it a Christian practice reserved for the extremely zealous, a liturgy marked out for those people who are close to God. 2. Ascesis Although faith is indispensible, it still does not absolve the operator of every fault. Faith is necessary but insufficient; it must be enhanced and confirmed by an ascesis that renders it indisputable and actual, which is the tangible proof of the operator's goodwill.74 By ascesis, the operator in effect cuts himself off from the temptations here below and realizes the conditions necessary for his soul to enter into contact with the superior world. To paraphrase Cornelius Agrippa's formula, the man who possesses purity becomes heavenly and entirely spiritual.75 According to a schema found in Neoplatonic theurgy, this catharsis has the ef­fect of\"disengaging the mens from all its bodily ties\" and of\"preparing it fo r the reception of divine pneuma. \"76 Jeanne Carlier notes that the idea that contact with the divine requires the separation of soul and body was, to a large extent, developed by Plato in the Phaedo (6sc and passim) and was subsequently taken up by the Neoplatonists, particularly by Porphyry in his De abstinentia (II 52) and in his Letter to Marcella (§10).77 The Ars notoria is plausibly in keeping with this tradition, which has equivalents in Christian mysticism. But more than realizing a true union with God by way of an anagogical movement of the soul, the practitioner of the art seeks to prepare himself for the descent of the divine through the mediation of an angelic vision. Like the Neoplatonic theurgist, he hopes to fulfill his soul with illuminations, gifts, and revelations of the divinity. 78 This ascesis, the first condition of the bona vita-that is, the active Christian life-consists of a set of monastically inspired recommendations. 79 The first is to guard oneself from the pleasures of the flesh. Chastity is a state necessary for the optimal functioning of the ritual of the Ars notoria, and the operator often finds himself repeating proscriptions of all sexual relations before or during the op­eration. He ought not to operate, it is said, post accessum mulieris. Further evi­dence that good conduct in this domain is one of the fundamentals of the art is the existence of a figure of chastity (jigura castitatis),80 which probably has the function of preserving this state in the operator. In the general way, ascesis per­mits a more effective battle against all the capital sins, such as lust, theft, perjury, murder, loss ofhope (more than despair}, gluttony, and drunkenness.81 The trea­tise particularly insists on the necessity of not taking immoderate pleasure in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 51 food and drink. 82 In order to satisfy the need for purity imposed by the Ars no­to ria, the operator must undertake fasts of differing lengths and of greater or lesser severity. In fact, for each prayer and each art, a different combination of bread-and-water fast, Lenten regime, and possibility of eating meat and drink­ing wine is proposed. Finally, to eradicate all sins that soil the body and soul, confession and penance must be performed before every invocation.83 The prac­titioner of the Ars notoria prepares himself like a faithful Christian before com­munion, because, like the communicant, he prepares himself for the reception of a divine sacrament. Note that certain methods of purification used in other mag­ical rituals do not have a place in the notory art, such as the ablutions and other suffumigations used, for example, in nigromantic rituals.84 Nor is it specified whether the practitioner should garb himself in clean ceremonial vestments. This exigency of purity is abundantly illustrated by the exempla. The first exemplum is found in the gloss commenting on the group of prayers with the incipit Hazatam and the explicit Hanuyrlyhahel. 85 The story goes as follows: one day, when Solomon went away to attend to some business, he forgot, in his haste, to put the book of the Ars notoria away out of the sight of indiscreet glances. It fell into the hands of one of his friends, who, taking advantage of the occasion, began to read the aforesaid prayers. But he had a soul burdened with sin. Hardly were the first words out of his mouth when the work fell from his hands. The punishment was as instant as it was inevitable: becoming mute, deaf, and blind, he found himself deprived of the use of the senses, memory, and intelligence. He was condemned, furthermore, to remain in this state until the hour of his death. It was only at the moment of reckoning that God permitted the blasphemer to enlighten the king. On point of death, he recounted to Solomon that fo ur angels scourged him from the moment of his trespass and that each of the angels per­fo rmed a well-defined task: the first set about rendering him mute, the second, blind. and the third, deaf, while the fourth deprived him of memory and intelli­gence. The person who does not respect the prescriptions of the treatise, Solomon concluded, must expect to undergo the wrath of the avenging angels. The second exemplum, developed in two places, concerns Solomon person­ally and reinterprets a passage from the book of Kings (Vulg. III Rg). 86 The king, contemplating the figures of the Ars notoria in a state of drunkenness (in the Bible he is reproved for loving outlandish women who turn him away from God), brings divine wrath down upon himself. While he is weeping after realizing the enormity of his fault, an angel appears to him and, in the name of God, forbids him access to the temple for eighty days. The messenger teaches him further that evil will fall on his descendants after his death. The interest of this exemplum lies not only in the moral it illustrates; it shows, above all, that if someone who has"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"52 INVOKING ANGELS been judged worthy of the revelation can be punished, then so can the ordi­nary person in his turn, and with more justice. The Ars notoria acknowledges no exceptions. But on account of the inexhaustible mercy of God, the fault of Solo­mon is not damning. In order to confirm the reconciliation, God delivers to him the Ars nova. 87 The officiating angel then reminds the king that he must not test the prescribed rules with his infidelity again. Solomon, still under the sentence of his previous trespass, did not dare to utter the new prayers right away. Only after a fast of three days did he pronounce them devoutly. The Ars nova thus makes official the new alliance between God and Solomon, but for all that, the malediction pertaining to his sons does not appear to lapse. 3· A Necessary Discretion The Ars notoria is not shared, and its mode of practice is individual.88 The trea­tise often mentions that one must proceed alone (solitario) in a secret place (in loco secreta) far from the vanity of the world. 89 There are several reasons fo r this. First, as shown by the exemplum mentioned above, if the book falls into the hands of an individual ignorant of its rules of procedure, it can put his life in danger. The informed operator, then, has a duty to prevent this sort of situation from occurring. Second, solitude is the indispensable complement to ascesis, since it prohibits any untimely temptation. The Ars notoria is a demanding ritual requiring withdrawal into oneself, concentration, and constant receptiveness; it is long enough that the operator tries to avoid making errors in case he should be obliged to start the whole procedure over again (though there exist, it is true, recuperative maneuvers).90 Third, every mystic proclaims the intimately per­sonal character of such experiences and their primary incommunicability.91 The treatise notably prohibits the operator from recounting the visions with which he is gratified.92 The experience of the divine cannot be transferred with words and must therefore be kept to oneself. Above all, in being divulged to just any­one, the art could lose its efficacy and its power-a classic allegation concerning all magical or theurgic practices since antiquity.93 Jean Dupebe notes that this rule of secrecy has \"a philosophical justification inherited from Plotinus and his disciple Porphyry\" that has to do with \"the loathing of exteriority and other­ness symbolized by the crowd, the enemy of the sage:'94 There is no wisdom possible but in contemplation. On this point, again, the Ars notoria is faithful to a very old tradition. Finally, the secret must be maintained for obvious reasons of security. If the practitioner is normally supposed to be alone, certain arrangements contravene this law in spite of everything. An illiterate operator can resort to the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 53 help of a master who teaches him the principles of the art.95 But note that the transmission from master to disciple has nothing obligatory about it, and there is no rite of initiation. Contrary, fo r example, to prescriptions of a theurge like the hermit Pelagius,96 a master in the case of the notory art does not have to assure himself that the operator is apt for the discipline. That selection is made in another way, through the preparatory vision. The mission of the master of the .-Irs notoria is much more modest. He transmits his knowledge of the ritual to one who cannot read the treatise correctly and teaches the neophyte to utter the prayers in a suitable manner. 97 He may be present at the ceremony undertaken �the neophyte in order to prevent any error of procedure in the operation, but be does not participate in the ritual, properly speaking. Only the one who wants the benefit of the vision (the person who is designated by the term operatus, operator) should recite the prayers. There is only one exception to this rule: if the practitioner is illiterate, the master can read the prayers once and the opera-1Dr\" may repeat the words after him.98 But it is the responsibility of the neophyte 10 assure himself of the moral rectitude of his mentor. 99 His attitude toward his JDaSter should not be anything like blind submission: to the extent that he risks serious danger on account of poor preparation, he has the duty and the right to control every exterior aspect of the operation. The operator can also have a servant (fa mulus), who has the function of sat­isfying his need for nourishment at prearranged times but who should not be present when he is actively engaged in the ritual operation.100 It is the servant who establishes the link between the operator and the outer world; he can, for cumple, undertake the duty of distributing alms. Obviously, he should be a trust­worthy man in every way, like his master, since he knows where the ritual is cUing place.101 The operator should not run the risk of a denunciation. It may be added, while we are on the topic of the people who surround the practitioner, that the Ars notoria does not require (unlike antique theurgy,102 Christian theurgy of the sort practiced by the hermit Pelagius, 103 nigromancy, 104 w even Jewish magic)105 the use of child mediums, who are judged more apt to establish contact with celestial powers and obtain their favors on account of their virginal purity. The most famous case is probably that of John of Salisbury, who recounts in the Policraticus the misadventure by which he was victimized in childhood.106 If the manuscript BnF, lat. 9336 in fa ct mentions pueri, it is be­ause children, like adults, can practice the Ars notoria, and special instructions � provided for them, especially as far as fasting is concerned. Those of fragile roostitution cannot be subjected to the rigorous regime of the ritual.107 The term puer can equally designate those who are beginners and who have no experience � with the notory art.108"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"54 INVOKING ANGELS A Verbal Ritual: Prayers with Angel Names 1. Ve rbal Magic and the Power of Language Every ritual is a complex mix of gestures (or actions) and words.109 A visual art when it comes to contemplating the notae or consulting books (see below), the Ars notoria is also a verbal art that recognizes an occult power in words and language. Language, our treatise tells us, draws its creative power from Genesis. God created the world by means of the Word,110 and its power remains unchallenged, even though the world has known a multiplicity of languages since the episode of the Tower of Babel. Words have different powers according to whether they belong to one language or another. The languages in use in the notory art­Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldean-are traditionally endowed with a great power in magical or theurgic operations, since they are connatural with divinity or the celestial powers.m Above all, these three languages are those of Solomon's rev­elation. Solomon, according to our text, wrote a book under a separate cover explaining their powers.112 Afterward, Apollonius undertook to translate into Latin the words in these languages, since with the passing of generations and translatio studii they fell into desuetude.113 But though he rendered a large part of the text accessible in Latin, there are certain ancient words that he could not or was unwilling to translate. Thus there still remain words in Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldean (at least supposedly), endowed with their original virtus. Obvi­ously, some corruption is inevitable with the passing of time. This may be noted whenever two manuscripts are compared sharing the same base text as the Latin manuscripts BnF, lat. 9336 (fourteenth century) and BnF, lat. 7153 (sixteenth cen­tury), but it is equally true if you compare two manuscripts of the thirteenth cen­tury, or two manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, respectively. The virtus of these ancient words, from now on incomprehensible in the Latin world, goes together with a formidable power of compression. The treatise insists that just one of them is often the equivalent of many Latin words.114 All translation is thus accompanied by a loss of substance.U5 A biblical exemplum from the book of Daniel (Dan. 5) is used to illustrate this belief.U6 When he was giving a party for his lords, King Balthazar used some gold and silver vessels from the temple of Jerusalem in an impious manner (he used them to drink wine). Suddenly, a hand appeared and wrote on the wall the words Mane, Techel, Phares. The king declared that anyone who figured out how to decipher these words would be the beneficiary of his largesse. The wise men and diviners of the realm hastened to satisfy the king, but all in vain. Daniel then came to the ex­ercise in his turn and translated the three words into Latin without difficulty.ll7"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 55 The author of the treatise set to a rapid reckoning and concluded that these three Hebrew words were the equivalent of twenty-three Latin words. The words of the original languages have a much more extensive signifying power than the later Latin words; at the same time, they establish a superior mode of commu­nication that binds the operator to the celestial powers, even as they remain hidden fr om the common run of mortals.118 This recourse to an occult language is common to all theurgy and is notably well established in the Chaldean Oracles and Neoplatonic theurgy.ll9 In this conception, the virtus verborum is of divine origin and consubstantial with the words themselves. But even if this is the dominant theoretical fr ame, the influence discernible in the Ars notoria of a more naturalistic conception of this power, such as one can find in the tradition ofthe Arab philosopher al-Kindi, must not be ruled out.120 In fact, our treatise­in particular the glossed version-insists heavily on the conditions necessary for a good utterance of the invocations, from which their greatest efficacy derives. The need for the operator to have a strong desire, to display goodwill, and to respect a tempus idoneus to reinforce the virtus of the pronounced utterances are the elements with an indubitably al-Kindian flavor.121 But if an indirect influ­ence is very probable, it is nevertheless unobtrusive, in the sense that the whole emanationist theoretical fr ame elaborated by al-Kindi in the De radiis is never taken into account in the notory art. This is probably because, for the author of the Ars notoria, a divine cause for the virtus verborum was a largely sufficient and less contestable gauge of efficacy.122 Finally, Latin is the fourth language used in the notory art. Since it is the language in use in the liturgy of the Christian West, it was privileged for com­munication with God.123 All the prayers addressed to God are composed in Latin. As we shall see, they make manifest a great deal about the relationship that the operator of the notory art intended to establish with the divinity. 2. The Prayers of the Ars notoria If the use of untranslatable words shows that the Ars notoria has filiations with an antique tradition, the recourse to prayers in Latin makes it into a theurgy of the Christian West. The treatise employs the term oratio to designate inter­changeably the lists of Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldean words and the Latin prayers. It gives the following definition: '�prayer [ oratio] is a sacramental mys­tery through words in Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, and Latin made manifest and pronounced:'1241t is significant that we do not find, for example, the term conju­ratio, which often occurs in the \"nigromantic\" manual edited by Richard Kieck­hefer.125 The practitioner of the notory art seeks, in effect, less to constrain the celestial powers (that is, God and the angels) than to attract their attention. Put"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"56 INVOKING ANGELS another way, he adjures more than he conjures. As with antique theurgy,126 the operator of the art seeks a reaction from the powers above by using certain signs, a language-in this case, the prayers that these powers delivered in the beginning and that are apt for them to understand and appreciate. If, in fa ct, the effect produced by these prayers is quasi-automatic,127 this is less because of the power of the operator than because of the sympathy binding the celestial powers to the language used. This last idea, to which Iamblichus dedicates an entire chapter of his De mysteriis, 128 is one of the pillars of theurgy. The prayers, like all that is sacred, were sent by the divinity to humankind; \"they fo rm codes that God alone can understand:'129 The Ars notoria, in conformity with its an­tique \"model;' is \"an operative symbolism designed to rouse the divine presence and power,\"130 and on this account it is not surprising, considering the Christian universe it inhabits, that it defines itself as a sacrament whose mysterious efficacy comes fr om God. The angel speaks thus to Solomon about the prayer Lemah, Sebauthe: \"See that you do not presume to expound or translate anything con­cerning this prayer, nor anyone through you, nor after you. The mystery of it is indeed sacramental.\"131 As a liturgical ritual that assures the divine presence, as it were, ex opere operato, the art is little different fr om the sacraments of the church, in particular the mystery of the Eucharist.132 Such a rapprochement is elsewhere made by Peter of Abano in his Liber conciliator.133 The prayers are considered sacramental elements that do not in any way constrain God and the angels.134 The difficulty of knowing for certain whether the relationship with God is established through the mode of conjuration or adjuration is evoked again as an undercurrent to the question of the true nature of the Ars notoria. Ritual magic is often defined as an ensemble of complex ceremonies that aim to give the prac­titioner an absolute power over superior entities, whether good, neutral, or evil. If the prayers do nothing but arouse the sympathy of God and the angels, and on this account elevate the art to the level of a sacrament, can we still speak of a \"magical\" practice? This evidently depends on one's point of view. For its own part, the art develops a discourse that aims to render it unopposable. Even as Iamblichus defended the highly religious character of his theurgy while denying that it exercised any constraint on heavenly spirits,135 the Ars notoria affirms its own definitively orthodox character and carefully rejects anything that might bring it closer to magic. By contrast, theologians, denying the sacramental anal­ogy, point out the demonic character of the art. Between the two, historians have a problem situating themselves objectively. 1be art probably counts as a magical practice from the perspective of the objectives it advertises for itself; it certainly involves a violation of nature, even though it affirms that the acqui­sition of wisdom is, to the contrary, natural and desired by God. On the other"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 57 hand, its mode of operation cannot be categorized as magical; the operator begs for divine contact in all humility. He guards himself against becoming a super­man dominating the spirit world. He wants to arouse sympathy. This difficulty of categorizing the Ars notoria is probably exacerbated by the fact that medieval­ists have mostly taken \"nigromancy\" -a much less ambiguous category-as the basis for their analyses of medieval magic. This vision of things actually involves an error of perspective owed largely to medieval theologians, who relegated everything even the least bit suspect to the field of the \"demonic:' As a result, today, as in the Middle Ages, the \"nigromancer\" who has power over demons remains the archetype of the magician.136 The Christian theurgist has no identi­fiable way to position himself, inasmuch as the good basis of his activity is con­tinually denied. The numerous Latin prayers by themselves embody the relationship estab­lished by the Ars notoria between God and the operator, and on this account ought to be considered a source separate from the treatise. Even a brief study of the lexical fields in use in these prayers reveals the importance of a vocabulary that marks the extreme humility and reverence evident when the operator ad­dresses God. 137 The gloss outmatches them in this domain.138 The speaker dep­recates himself continuously, making a constant issue of his weak and fr agile nature. Without ambiguity, God remains the great dispenser who acts according to his goodwill, as the first prayer, among others, emphasizes: Alpha and omega, omnipotent God, beginning without beginning of all things, end without end, today hear my prayers, most merciful, and pass retribution not according to my iniquities and not according to my sins, my Lord God, but pity me according to your mercy, which is greater than all visible and invisible things. Wisdom of the Father, Christ, light of the angels, glory of the saints, hope and harbor and refuge of sinners, Creator of all things, and redeemer of human frailty who encompass with a hand heaven and earth and all the sea and the weight of mountains, you, most merciful, I beseech and pray that together with the Father, you illuminate my soul with a ray of your most Holy Spirit, until in this sacrosanct art I advance so much that I may be able to attain knowledge of this science and of any art whatsoever, and wisdom, memory, eloquence, intelligence, and understanding by the power of your most Holy Spirit and your name. And you who are my God, you, who in the beginning created heaven and earth and everything out of nothing, who, in your Spirit, reform all things, complete, restore, keep my intellect, that I may glorify you through all works of my thought and my words. God, Father, confirm my prayer and increase my intellect and my memory for the undertaking, understanding,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"58 INVOKING ANGELS and retaining of all writings, knowledge, memory, eloquence, and perse­verance, you who live and reign through endless ages of ages, amen.139 These prayers respect strict Christian orthodoxy: belief in one creator God of all things, in the Trinity, in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, and so on.140 As Frank Klaassen has justifiably emphasized, these prayers could be extracted from their context without fear of appearing less orthodox.141 They are very close to prayers found, for example, in the literature of devotion for the use of laity at the end of the Middle Ages.142 Both types of prayers beseech God to satisfy a precise desire according to the merits of each. The structure of these Latin prayers is simple and repetitive: an address evokes the different divine attributes; then comes the body of the prayer, which states the desires of the suppliant. In any case, the prayers do not have the complex structure of \"nigromantic\" conjurations, and they take a different tone.143 The prayers give the Ars notoria its mystical coloring. The suppliant beseeches, in effect, for a personal divine intervention intended to improve his character. But a mystical ascent of the soul is not clearly mentioned in the desire for union with God. Rather, the movement is in the other direction: it is God, in the person of the Holy Spirit, who turns toward the person performing the invocation.144 The suppliant prays for God to free his spirit (mens) from material cares and to make it fit to receive illumina­tion. The suppliant also solicits a purification of the heart, the organ that is the seat of the soul. Finally, he implores for divine intervention with his body, since the flesh, like the spirit, must be pure and released from the weight of vice in order for the infusion to occur. In respect to these ideas, I would like to broach one last question: does the Ars notoria have an eschatological dimension? It must be remembered that an­cient theurgy, especially that defined by Iamblichus, was a religious operation ordained for the suppliant's salvation.145 The father of theurgy treats the question thus in his Mysteries: \"It is evident, from the effects themselves, that what we now say is the salvation of the soul. For the soul, in contemplating blessed spec­tacles, acquires another life, energizes according to another energy, and is then rightly considered as no longer ranking in the order of man. Frequently, like­wise, abandoning her own life, she exchanges it for the most blessed energy of the gods:'146 \"Pte theurgic ritual, in favoring the contact of the believer with the supreme being here below, has the virtue of favoring the lot of the soul in the other world and leading it into the bosom of God.147 Can the theurgic activity of the Ars notoria pretend to have this virtue, even though it does not define it­self in anagogical terms, but rather according to a mode of descent? The salva­tion of the soul, it must be said, is not the principal objective of the art, but it is one of its essential corollaries; the art enters into the economy of salvation in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 5 9 that it has the value of a sacrament. It was issued from a divine revelation and is destined to better the nature of humans; it cannot but favor the postmortem destiny of those who resort to it. This also holds from the fact that it requires very Christian conduct, tending toward sanctity. The assiduous practitioner, then, has all the odds on his side come Judgment Day.I48 Another element with similar implications, the prayer Lemahc, Sebauthe, which comes decked with different names that make evident its great virtue (\"Happiness·of Spirit;' \"Light of the Soul;' and \"Mirror of Wisdom\"), bears also the name \"Image of Eternal Life'' -proof that it may be seen, with all the other prayers, as a means of prog­ress on the difficult road to salvation.149 J. Angelology and Names of God Most of the Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldean names that, beside the Latin prayers, create the power of the notory art are, as the treatise affirms, angel names. A brief comparison shows that BnF, lat. 9336 possesses a particularly developed angelology by comparison to older manuscripts like Sloane 1712.150 How do we explain this proliferation? One simple factor motivates such a development. To know the name of an individual is, in fa ct, to hold some power over that individual.151 This aphorism is more meaningful in the framework of a theurgic operation that consists of invoking spirits that exist only through their names. The suppliant who wishes to obtain heavenly gifts has, then, a great interest in knowing a large number of names in order to assemble under his banner the greatest possible majority of celestial creatures. As he increases his suffrage in the world above, he multiplies tenfold his chances of being heard.152 If, theoretically, the knowledge of angel names issues from the original revelation and is thus immutable, the \"author\" of the glossed version has not resisted the temptation to multiply his chances of success by creating a considerable number of names. He has modified for the exigencies of this case a text that proclaims itself \"very sacred\" (sacratissimus) and \"very holy\" (sanctissimus). But according to what mechanisms? It is undeniable that the angelology of the Ars notoria has in some manner fallen under the influence ofJewish angelology.153 Judaism, in fact, quite early on developed numerous techniques permitting the multiplication of angel names, although these were very few at their point of origin in the Old Testament. S. M. Olyan delivers very pertinent analyses of this phenomenon in ancient Judaism, showing how the creation of names derives from exegesis of the Old Testament; fo r example, a number of divine attributes have served as a base for the elabora­tion of angelic names, notably the terms that express divine wrath in the Bible.154 This method, which authorizes endless variations, was used abundantly at the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"60 INVOKING ANGELS same time that the rabbis commenting on the Old Testament elaborated the doc­trine of angels in Judaism.155 The Sepher ha-Razim, a magic text of the Talmudic period,156 uses hundreds of angel names constructed from Hebrew roots with the suffix -e/.157 The Christian West thus inherited a tradition that was reacti­vated from the end of the twelfth century, and particularly during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, by the proliferation of kabbalistic texts.158 Kabbalah, in multiplying the combinatory methods of letters of the Hebrew alphabet, per­mitted an exponential increase in the number of angel names. The Ars notoria may have drawn upon this source in angelological matters, but with all the prob­lems potentially created by the transliteration from Hebrew to Latin. Thus in the glossed version we count around 350 names terminating in the suffix -el, or its derivatives -hel or -iel, of which some (in fact very few) are found in similar forms in lists established by Moise Schwab and Gustav Davidson.159 This pene­tration and possible transposition from Jewish angelology into a practice of the Latin Christian world revives questions of intellectual contacts between Jews and Christians. Did the authors of the Ars notoria resort to Latin-conversant Jews to work the transliteration, or did they themselves have sufficient knowl­edge of Hebrew to undertake this task? According to Benoit Grevin, the pos­sibility cannot be excluded that, at certain times, some fraction of the Jewish population furnished a Christian clientele with materials, adapting it to the Christian cultural profile.160 If the angelic onomastics of the Ars notoria preserves clear Semitic contours in the thirteenth- and fourteenth -century version of the text, a process of alteration is, however, already at work, of which one can see the conclusion in the Turner edition put together in the seventeenth century.161 For the rest, from the thirteenth century on, the reaction of Hebrew-conversant Christians in the face of the degradation of Hebrew names in magic treatises is illuminating. An extract from an anonymous correspondence, which hence­forth can be attributed to Roger Bacon,162 reflects this exactly, and directly con­cerns the notory art. The doctor mirabilis complains of the Latin corruption of divine names issuing from Hebraic speculations on the tetragrammaton: Moreover, in the explanation of the aforesaid name which is contained in the first three chapters of the aforesaid book (i.e., Liber semamphoras), a ce�tain name is posited of seventy-two letters which is called sem ampho­ras (i.e., \"the explained name\"), and from the seventy-two letters of the name, following on the diverse combination of them, diverse divine names are composed, which all lie hid in the aforesaid name of God tetragram­maton; and I think that the book of Solomon, which is called Ars notoria and is to be had in Latin (where many divine names are set which are so much corrupted by the fault of Latin scribes that now they are neither"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 61 Hebrew nor any other tongue), may contain the aforesaid names, and from these comes power, maybe even the power which is promised. But I cannot judge with certainty about this, because, as I said, I could not see the three first parts of the aforesaid book, and I do not think that in these regions there is a Jew who has them.163 This corruption of the angelic onomastics is particularly flagrant from one version of the Ars notoria to the other. It is clear that a play on syllables, stripped of logic, must have presided in many cases over the confection of an important number of names present in our manuscript, which explains why the angel names are much more numerous here than in the thirteenth-century manu­scripts.164 Moreover, this phenomenon does not exclusively concern names of Hebrew origin, and for a good reason: the names derived from Greek are at least as numerous. The angelic onomastics of the Ars notoria is the fruit of a syncre­tism of which the ins and outs are not always easy to disentangle-a syncretism that may be very old, since, as Joshua Trachtenberg emphasizes, the names com­ing out of Hebrew are not all themselves conscious creations.165 The use of ono­mata barbara, very widespread in Egyptian magic, spread broadly into ancient Judaism as well as the ancient Greek world-notably into Neoplatonic theurgy­before penetrating the Christian West. We may add that our lists of angel names do not add up to a well-established celestial hierarchy. The text never specifies, before entering into any of its grad­ual harvests of angelic names, whether this or that list is composed of names of archangels or of angels. Distinctions are made without rigor, and in this in­exhaustible stream it is only possible to recognize some traditional names of archangels, like Michael (4 occurrences); Guabrihel (2), Guabriel (1), or Gabriel (1); Urihel (2), Uryel (1), or Hurihel (1); Raphahel (2) or Raphael (1). The trea­tise repeatedly affirms the existence of a celestial hierarchy of Dionysian inspi­ration,166 but these affirmations are purely formal and have no real effect on how the operation unfolds. Names of God, by comparison, are far less numerous. There, too, a carryover from Judaism must be remarked, notably on account of speculation about the ·Ineffable Name\" of God.167 Old Testament exegesis presided from a very early point over the creation of numerous names formed from divine attributes, of which some were taken over by Christians. Of all names in use, those that are associated directly with the divinity have the most power; this explains their everyday use in simple prayers throughout the Middle Ages.168 To designate God, our text, for the most part, uses the classical term Deus and its inflected forms (285 occurrences), Dominus (193), Spiritus Sanctus (88),"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"62 INVOKING ANGELS Ihesus Christus (12), or Filius (14). Then come, in decreasing order of occur­rence, more specific names (mostly derived from Hebrew, with some exceptions): Theos (\"God\" in Greek, 28); Usyon or Usion (22); Theon (16); Heloy (15); Adonay or Ydonay (\"Lord\" in Hebrew, 14); Ioht or Iotha (deformation oflod or Ya, one of the ten holy names of God, 14); Iechor or Iecor (12); Hel (u); Halla (10); Honor On (10 ); Otheos (10 ); Hathanatos or Hatanathos (9);169 Alpha et Omega {biblical name of God, 7);170 Patyr (7); Saday (\"Almighty;' s); Seguoht (5); Emanuhel or Emanuel (5); Hay (4); Hely (\"God;' 4); Messyas or Messias (4); Sother (4); Saba­hot or Sabaoth (4); Agla (acronym for four Hebrew words, aieth gadolleolam Adonai, forming the phrase \"You reign for eternity, 0 Lord;' 1); and Thetragram­athon (1).171 The surprise comes with Usyon, which is a name not in everyday use, at least so far as we know, and above all with the ten occurrences of Halla (\"God\" in Arabic), which shows how deep the syncretism goes from which the Ars no­toria is born. As far as the rest are concerned, the names are fairly common. A Visual Art Although the Ars notoria ritual gives a large place to speech, the virtus verborum is not always sufficient. The operator must also use other signs, of a visual na­ture, which are meant to favor divine intervention. These signs are made up of figures that offer their particular power to the gaze. 1. The Figures of the Ars notoria Essential components of the famous notae, the figures remain, in all essential ways, an enigma. What is their purpose? To what pictorial tradition do they be­long?172 Without pretending to answer these questions definitively at this point, we can still make a number of observations. Each discipline for which the Ars notoria permits acquisition is given a cer­tain number of figures. The treatise justifies these attributions (which might appear arbitrary) by setting the scene with a long dialogue between the angel Pamphilus, the agent of the original revelation, and King Solomon.173 A bit dumb­founded at seeing himself entrusted with so valuable an art, the king scarcely understands the logic governing the distribution of the figures. The angel takes it upon himself to set him straight by showing him that divine providence makes no mistakes. He first considers the case of grammar. This Ars is given three fig­ures, \"neither more nor less:' This is because grammar is divided into three parts, the ordinatio litterarum, the distinctio dictionum, and the constructio casuum, and therefore needs one figure for each part: \"Thus it pleased divine foresight that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 63 three notae should be appropriate here:'174 He goes on with dialectic (or logic). This science having two parts, fluency of argument (fa cundia argumentandi) and diligence of response (industria respondendi), God provides two figures. Rhetoric, being divided into four parts, has, on that account, four figures.175 What function do these figures have? The text is not very explicit on this point. As with the prayers, it insists on the mystery surrounding their revelation and explains their great value. For the rest, we are reduced to making hypothe­ses. In the first place, it is possible to relate the figurae of the Ars notoria and the sunthemata (or symbols) used in Neoplatonic theurgy. These symbols (\"charac­ters:' fo r Saint Augustine)176 serve to obtain the sympathy of the gods in a man­ner from which the notory art is not very far removed. Sunthemata and figurae are in both cases the issue of divine revelation, the effect of which is that \"the divine power itself recognizes its own images in these symbols and is drawn by affinity and sympathY:'177 Second, from a practical point of view, the examination of these figures, along with the incessant repetition of prayers and rigorous ascesis, probably had, over a more or less long term, a psychological impact on the operator that was likely to favor a visionary experience.178 This is what David Freedberg calls the \"the practice of image-assisted meditation:' which is found in Christian mysticism as well.179 A similar function of images, in an absolute sense, was far from being rejected by theologians. Saint Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas, for example, admitted completely that more emotions could be produced by things seen than by things heard.180 But in the case of the notory art, the figures are too much akin to the theurgic \"characters\" that Augustine stigmatized, according to him destined to attract demons. Third, if it appears out of the question that the figures have some sort of figu­rative function, it is conceivable that they might be symbolic representations of different disciplines.181 Of course, the text does not elaborate any theory on this question at any point, but the clearly Neoplatonic inspiration of the Ars notoria forbids the exclusion of some such possibility.182 The figures might be ideal rep­resentations (which lie outside the capacities oflanguage and traditional repre­sentations) of symbols that deliver the essence of different artes to the person who looks at them.183 Each one contains, in its ineffable mystery, the whole depth of the science of which it is the symbol, and each is gifted with a power of resti­tution, a virtue uniquely transmissible through the gaze.184 Finally, might it be possible that the figures of the notory art are memory fig­ures? The principal objective of the art is, in effect, to develop the memory of the operator and thus permit him to retain the content of the angelic vision without difficulty. Might the figures, then, have the function of reminding him of the different parts of the artes that he wants to acquire? The mnemonic techniques"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"64 INVOKING ANGELS used by medieval clerics have been well described by Frances Yates and Mary Carruthers.185 The art of memory consists in creating mental images in which each detail represents a part of the discourse to be delivered. Most of the time, each art is represented by a woman who has an easily recognizable attitude or who carries different attributes; however, the aide-memoire can also take the form of more abstract schemas. For example, a tree permits infinite hierarchiza­tion and division. Another commonly used schema was the \"mnemonic wheel,\" of which one of the best -known forms is the planetary diagram, used to remem­ber the diverse parts of astronomy.186 Several figures of astronomy in BnF, lat. 9336 reproduce this schema (fol. 22r): constituted of concentric circles, they list the signs of the zodiac, the elements, and diverse qualities (hot, cold, etc.). The case of astronomy is not unique. Some other disciplines are symbolized by schemas that list the different parts of their associated art. The first figure of geometry (fol. 26r) is thus constituted of small circles that contain the principal notions of the discipline: linea, superficia, punctum, profunditas, altitudo; and underneath we can also read triangulum, quadrangulum, pentagulum, exaggonos, rotundum, etc. The first figure of rhetoric (fol. 19v) is another illustrative case. But if these examples can assert themselves as probative, it must be admitted that not every figure details every part of the science symbolized-far from it. And yet, if the figures are not memory images in the classic sense, they are so in the framework of the \"magical\" operation that is the notory art. 2. \"Inspecting the Books of the Other Arts\" If the operator \"inspects\" the figures at length, he should also leaf through (re­volvere) books containing each of the subjects he wants to acquire at the same time. The knowledge must actually be incarnate in the neighborhood of the practitioner for the illumination to take place.187 An experimentum imparted by a late English edition illustrates perfectly this focusing of desire on the book. It is a question of acquiring in one night, thanks to a simplified procedure, the entire contents of a book-a very practical review process on the eve of univer­sity examinations or a doctrinal debate. This is what to do: \"If thou desirest to understand any book, ask of some that hath knowledge therein, what that book treateth of. This being done, open the book, and read it, and operate as at first three times, and always when thou goest to sleep, write Alpha and Omega, and afterwards sleep on the right side, putting the palm of the hand under thy ear, and thou shalt see in a dream all things thou desirest.\"188 The book is the incarnation of perfect knowledge on a human scale. With divine assistance, the practitioner intends to transplant the book's contents into his mind. The recourse to books that he must (as with the figures) place before"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 65 llis eyes highlights the role of the gaze in the Ars notoria. This is a visual art, awe all, that expects to transmit its virtue through the gaze-the invisible and occult link between the mind of the operator and what is outside it. An Objective: \"To Acquire Total Knowledge\" 1be supreme goal of the Ars is the acquisition of all knowledge. Richard Kieck­tder hypothesized that a similar goal, common to diverse types of Christian .agic (the Ars notoria and necromancy), drew its source from Jewish magic. In fact, early kabbalistic texts suggest that the angels at first tried to hinder the .-ansmission of the Torah to men, at the same time, and as a consequence, mak­illg it difficult for individuals to memorize it. The adjuration of spirits, in par-1icular of the \"Prince of the Torah;' was then a means to which the student of *ology had recourse in order to master the sacred text.189 Such a filiation is not 10 be excluded, but at the same time caution is necessary for the time being . .. the notory art, the infusion is effected by the intermediary of a vision, gener­� while the operator is asleep. This in turn effects contact with a knowledge 1lllal: is superior to sensory or rational knowledge. Jean Dupebe saw in this result a intended claim, intrinsic to all forms of gnosis, to discredit the discursive daaracter of knowing by the instantaneousness of visionary revelation. I90 Never­*less, in its desire to encompass all forms of knowledge, it seems that the art llldiJses to theorize this antagonism and even means to leave it unstated. It would az to be an art founded as much on reason as on perpetual miracle: \"For it is to • understood that the notory art contains in itself all arts and the knowing of •lett ers marvelously and indubitably and indeed rationallY:'191 Thus the treatise 1lies to counter the objection of contemporary theologians who strictly opposed mional knowledge to the knowledge originating with celestial powers.192 This daim to recover the totality of knowledge is also found in the name the Ars gives ibldf: \"the art of arts\" or \"science of sciences.\"193 If it rejects this systematic op­position, it still remains true that the art permits learning by other than natural .r:ans and at the same time avoids long and tedious study. For the rest, nothing Aegitimate is found in it, since all progress along the road to knowledge enters ialo the divine plan. For this, humanity has two methods at its disposal: reason .d the Ars notoria, fruit of a revelation.194 Before the acquisition of the artes, the art reinforces the principal faculties -.:essary for all medieval study: eloquence (necessary for disputatio), intelli­pce, and above all memory, the alpha and omega of all medieval teaching. As � asult, the bestowed knowledge never leaves the Scholastic framework. It is mmtituted of the artes liberales, philosophy, and theology. The classification of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"66 INVOKING ANGELS the sciences used is not without difficulties, however. First of all, if the trivium corresponds to the traditional classification (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic),195 then the quadrivium is a bit topsy-turvy, since it includes medicine in place of geometry.196 This intrusion of medicine in the quadrivium can be explained by the fa ct that the original version of the Flores aurei was most probably redacted in the second half of the twelfth century, if not at the beginning of the thirteenth, in a period when sciencia physica had not yet found its place in the curriculum and when it was often considered an \"eighth liberal art.\"197 Another difficulty, astronomia (a term designating both astronomy and astrology) contained the \"mechanical\" arts, that is, many of the divinatory or magical arts condemned by the church: ydromantia, pyromantia, nygromantia, cyromantia, geomantia, geo­nogya, neonogya.198 It is not known what the last two artes refer to, but it appears necessary in the first place fo r the treatise to put the seven liberal arts in parallel with the seven artes mechanice, adulterine, or exceptive.199 While the text places all these illicit arts under the heading of astronomia, the gloss actually puts them under philosophy-a notable inconsistency between the treatise and the com­mentary.200 We may add that the \"mechanical\" arts do not have their own figures: to acquire them, the operator must examine the figures called \"generals:'201 Among the seven \"mechanical\" arts, the treatise particularly insists on the least innocuous among them, namely, nygromantia, which here means necromancy­that is, divination by the spirits of the dead, in fa ct quite rare in the Middle Ages: \"Nygromantia dicitur a nygros [actually necros] quod est mortuum.\"202 It is speci­fied that this mode of divination necessitates animal sacrifice: \"Nygromantia vero est quoddam sacrificium animalium mortuorum et de sanguine eorum.\" More uncommon is the gloss's division of this material into seven parts. Two of them are judged entirely illicit, as they suppose that the operator sacrifices to malign spirits, which is a mortal sin and something presupposed to be in every way contrary to the principles of the Ars notoria. 203 It is not really possible to tell what supports this seven-way division of nygromantia, but we can still see in it the desire to elaborate a numerological correspondence with the seven \"mechan­ical\" arts, on the one hand, and the seven liberal arts, on the other. In authorizing the learning of the \"mechanical\" arts, the Ars notoria cannot but attract the hostile attention of the authorities. It certainly puts the operator on guard against the clearly infernal arts and seems to keep its distance from these.204 But in fact it does nothing to forbid deviance in this regard. Defending its claim to hegemony at all costs, it prefers to open a breach into which its de­tractors can sink, rather than sacrifice, the least scrap of knowledge. What to conclude at the provisional end of this investigation? On the one hand, ascesis, the use of verbal or figured symbols that arouse divine sympathy, and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MAGIC, THEURGY, AND SPIRITUALITY 67 absence of constraint imposed on heavenly powers or on the divinity, are ele­ments that situate the Ars notoria in the line of Neoplatonic theurgy, or at least undeniably indicate their common nature. If it is appropriate to retain a certain caution in this matter-as I have said repeatedly-it does not remain less true that diffuse elements emanating from the Greek world have rubbed off on this art. 205 At this point, it is a question of knowing how it happened. On the other hand, if the notary art has a modus operandi that can be qualified as theurgic, its final objective is more practical: it authorizes the practitioner to bypass his true nature by bestowing on him the totality of knowledge. If magic is defined as an operation that modifies the natural equilibrium in a rapid and violent way, then the notary art must be considered a magical practice as fa r as its goal is concerned (though the Christian theurgy of Pelagius, for example, does not ex­dude certain material gains).206 This is nothing but a mental discipline. From the contacts it makes with the superior world, benefits less spiritual can also be derived. In the end, the distinction between theurgy and magic is a question more of method than of result. When the theurgist obtains an earthly gain through its ties to the celestial powers, he does so without binding them to his \"ill. He does nothing but receive a gift to recompense his great devotion. By contrast, the magician establishes a true relation of domination. The benefit he draws from the celestial powers should not be considered a gift but a brutal ex­tortion. To acquire knowledge, nothing hinders the claimant from resorting to ·rugromancy;' but those who prefer to follow the method of the notary art prob­ably chose to avoid sacrificing the means to the end.207 �OTES 1.

This chapter focuses on two magic texts circulat­ing in the late Middle Ages, the Liber de essentia spirituum and the Liber Razielis, which originated in Arabic and Jewish contexts, respectively, and explores the extent to which these fit a model of theurgic practice as compared both to late antique precedents and to the texts of Christian theurgy discussed elsewhere in this book. The Liber de essentia spirituum and the Liber Razielis are magic texts in which spiritual advancement is sought and undertaken by the practitioner. The de­scent of spirits to teach the practitioner or grant him celestial knowledge is linked in both texts with a corresponding ascent of the practitioner's soul while his body remains living. In addition, the personal interaction between spirit and man is set against a broader cosmology focusing on the wretchedness of mortal life and the return of the soul to God. While the rituals in these texts do not guarantee the soul's salvation, they do imply that those worthy to undertake the art will achieve it, and the texts give examples of those who have done so. An­other significant fe ature of these texts is that the reception of a celestial revela­tion and the elevated status of the practitioner are linked to the formation of communities of the elect with whom this knowledge is shared. In the Liber Ra­zielis, the revelation is also placed in the context of a magical chain of tradition, in which a celestial book is said to have been transmitted from Adam through a line of sages and prophets.1 Owing to their different origins, the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spirituum diverge on various points of cosmology and rituai.2 Nevertheless, it is"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"80 INVOKING ANGELS useful to compare them with works of magic written by Christians. Those works most frequently associated with angel magic or theurgy, the Ars notoria, the Liber iuratus Honorii, and the Liber visionum, were clearly formulated under the in­fluence ofJewish and Arabic magic, but they also place emphasis on specifically Christian mediators, namely, Christ and the Virgin Mary. In the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spirituum, man is an active seeker of celestial revelation and redemptive ascent without recourse to the mediation of Christ. 3 Angels or spirits play a dominant part in the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spirituum, but to a large extent these beings are not mediators with the divine addressed with supplication, as in Christian theurgy. Rather, they are powers whose attributes should be learned and manipulated by the practitioner for his own ends. In both texts the cosmological context of each group of spirits is described in some detail, as this provides the means for the practitioner to invoke them at the correct time and for the right purpose. The Liber Razielis advocates requesting divine favor and assistance through prayer, but it usually emphasizes the recitation and inscription of names rather than the supplication of the practitioner before God.4 In both texts, terms such as \"entice,\" \"compel,\" and \"imprison\" appear alongside terms suggestive of invocation and conjura­tion. The practitioner acquires knowledge of the cosmos, including astrology, angelology, and terrestrial and celestial correspondences. This knowledge, how­ever, is already recorded in the texts, rather than being received in the process of a dialogue and continuous supplication before the divine, a pattern typical of Christian ritual magic. 5 1. Origins and Contexts The Liber de essentia spirituum is an anonymous Latin text written in an ob­scure, hieratic style, which survives in a single, incomplete copy in a fourteenth­century manuscript of St. Augustine's, Canterbury provenance, Oxford, Corpus Christi 125.61t is set in the context of an angelic vision that its author claims to have received while he was living in Seville, a city inhabited by Arabs, Christians, and Jews in the late Middle Ages, although this work does not adhere closely to any of these religious traditions. The cosmology conveyed in the text can rather be viewed in the context oflate classical, largely non-Christian and Neoplatonic philosophical and literary texts. These works, including the Timaeus, Apuleius's De deo Socratis, Macrobius's and Calcidius's Commentaries, and the De nuptiis of Martianus Capella, were the main sources of cosmological ideas in the Latin We st until the introduction of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Arabic com­mentaries and works of philosophy, astrology, and science from the twelfth cen-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 81 tory. It is in this context of intellectual transition that the Liber de essentia spiri­tlmm is best placed. The inclusion of astrological concepts and terminology and of techniques re­llling to image magic indicate that the author had access to Arabic occult works translated into Latin in twelfth-century Spain. This merging of Arabic magic with Platonic cosmology by a Christian author may be explained by the fact that many of the early translations from Arabic into Latin originated in Platonic circles and were received by people favorable to Platonic philosophy? The vision­uy framework and image-magic techniques of the Liber de essentia spirituum suggest the influence of a fluid corpus of Arabic Hermetic magic, entitled vari­ously the Kitab al-Istamatis, Kitab al-Istamakhis, Kitab al-Maditis, and so on. Puts of this corpus were known to Latin scholars by the second quarter of the twelfth century, and it is referred to in the Picatrix. 8 Like the Liber de essentia spirituum, these Arabic texts situated their magic techniques within a cosmic duonology and mythology that included stories of the descent of the spirits of 1be planets into each region to reveal magical knowledge. The impact of Jewish texts on the magical traditions of the medieval Latin �has been much less studied than the transmission and assimilation of works ol Arabic magic, although the former certainly influenced works of magic like 1be Ars notoria, the Liber vision urn, and the Liber iuratus Honorii. 9 These texts a&r evidence that the mixture of mystical, cosmological, and magical material found in Jewish sources and practice was selectively assimilated by the Latin West. As was the case with many works of Hermetic magic translated from Arabic into Utin, cosmological structures were pared down in favor of practical elements, tueh as the names and attributes of angels. Magic texts were adapted to a Chris­tian readership by placing emphasis on the more licit art of astrology, on an­piogy, or on the Christian mystical currents present in the ritual magic texts aredabove. The most explicit transmission of Jewish magical material into Latin was the translation of works associated with the name Raziel, an angel present in Jewish ..gelology and Arabic astrological texts who was said to have revealed a book ol secrets to Adam.10 Various esoteric and magical treatises attributed to Raziel JRd based on the practical use of divine and angelic names circulated among Jn,\"S in the late Middle Ages.U The earliest known reference in Latin is a citation .,-the Christian convert Petrus Alfonsus (1062-1110) of a certain Secretum secre­ltlnlm, which claimed to have been revealed to Seth, the son of Adam, by the .-gel Raziel.12 By the mid-thirteenth century these magic texts were circulating .ore widely in Latin and provoking mixed responses. Alfonso X \"El Sabio\" of Castile (r. 1252-1284) pursued his interests in the com­plementary fields of Arabic image magic and Jewish angelology by collecting"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"82 INVOKING ANGELS texts of both genres and producing compilations and translations of themP In 1259 Alfonso directed the translation of a work titled Liber Razielis from Latin into Castilian by the cleric Juan dl\\.spa. 141he Castilian version does not survive, but the Latin original put together by Alfonso survives in two complete and several partial copies, as well as in various early modern abridged vernacular versions.151his Alfonsine Liber Razielis is structured in the form of seven books said to have been brought together by Solomon,16 to which a number of related texts from the Solomonic and Hermetic magical traditions were added as ap­pendices.17 Each book focuses on a different element of magical practice: the Liber clavis on astrology, the Liber Ale on natural magic, the Liber thymiama on suffumigations, the Liber temporum on angels associated with divisions of time, the Liber mundicie et abstinentie on ritual cleanliness and abstinence, and the Liber Sameyn on the angels of the heavens. Two different versions of the seventh book circulated: the Liber magice, 18 which focused on image magic, and the Liber virtu tis, 19 an abridged version of the first appended work, the Liber Semafo ras (Semhemaforas, Semiphoras, Seminafora, Semforas), which was concerned with names of power. The preface to the Alfonsine Liber Razielis cites a Hebrew origi­nal for the compilation, the \"<;:effer Raziel, quod vult dicere in ebrayco Vo lumen secretorum Dei, \"20 although it is likely that the structure is partly, if not entirely, a creation of Alfonso himself and his translators.21 Contemporaneously with the construction of Alfonso's volume, a Liber insti­tutionis Razielis, with the incipit \"In prima huius proemii parte de angulis tractemus:· was condemned in the influential Sp eculum astronomiae. 22 On the basis of the Sp eculum astronomiae's focus on image magic, this work has been identified with the Liber magice. 23 It therefore seems likely that the Liber magice was replaced at some point with the Liber Semafo ras by an influential copyist in order to avert criticism, and the names of the books themselves can be viewed as expressive of this aim. However, the critique of names in this text by the author of the Speculum astronomiae could be applied to other books in the Alfonsine Liber Razielis, and on these grounds the text was unlikely to escape censure.24 The Alfonsine work gives prominence to Solomon, placing emphasis on the wise biblical ruler in order to make the text more fitting to its royal patron.25 This appears to be an innovation of Alf onso's scribe, since Solomon is not men­tioned in the prologue of another surviving Latin version of the Liber Razielis, which 1s more closely related to the composite Hebrew Sefe r Raziel ha-Mal'akh (ed. Isaac ben Abraham, Amsterdam, 1701).26 In the Alf onsine Liber Razielis, Adam's reception of the book from the angel Raziel, which emphasizes man's suf­fering and wretchedness, is not fully described until the sixth book of the com­pilation, the Liber Sameyn. 27 The Liber Sameyn circulated separately with other parts of the Alfonsine compilation.

Cosmology and Revelation in the Liber de essentia spirituum The Liber de essentia spirituurn opens with an image revealed to its author of the illusory nature of the corruptible world and the contrasting incorruptible es­sence of the souP2 Subsequent passages, heavy with scorn and admonition, de­scribe the corrupt and suffering state of mankind in the sublunar world and mankind's distance from the perfection of the first essence.33 In this early sec­tion, the central revelatory aim of the work is outlined: to disclose the true na­ture of the cosmos and God to worthy souls seeking to escape from the prison of the flesh and ascend to blessedness. Moreover, it appears that this blessed state can, to some extent, be achieved on earth, for the author writes that in order to \"be assimilated into True Being as much as possible;' he has \"left worldly things to worldly matters, fallen things to fallen, transitory to transitory things:'34 He presents himself as a man \"sleeping in blessedness, waiting for the numbers of the resolution to be completed so that I should return as quickly as possible to that from which I fell.\"35 Despite this apparently somnambulant state, he as­sumes a prophetic role, declaring, \"I was made a shoot profiting others:'36 In the final passage in this section, he describes his reception of an \"image of true light\" and his decision to transmit, in writing to the worthy, the knowledge he has received: I therefore conceived of places deserted of every inhabitant in which, for thirty years, I had an image of true light with these, who, having now be­come companions of my blessedness, invited me to my empty seat. So that in the shadow of darkness a small light may shine, whatever I have learned in their sweet companionship about the essence and classification of the spirits and their double embodying, from those who do not deviate from"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"84 INVOKING ANGELS the precaution of truth unless either from scorn of inferior obedience or from voluptuousness, the helper of the stupid man, I have written down in detail to be transmitted fo r their common survival, bearing witness to everyone by the living God that no one should be allowed <to know these secrets> except the one who alone will be fo und worthy of the dual regime of the spirit; otherwise he will be struck by a punishment for such a great crime from the wrathful, more powerful <beings>.37 This rather opaque passage provides a number of interesting indications of the context in which the author situates his revelation. Over a period of thirty years he claims to have communed with spirits in a deserted region. It is not clear whether his soul has ascended to the celestial level of these spirits or whether they have descended to share his desert habitation. Although it is un­likely that a twelfth-century author would have had direct knowledge of Iam­blichus, the invitation to an empty seat recalls a description in the reply to the \"Letter of Porphyry to Anebo\" of theurgists' souls, \"seated in the orders of an­gels,\" purified from matter and providing corporeal souls with hope (83, 4-5).38 lamblichus believed that the perfection of the individual soul could be achieved only by its ascent to the divine being, and that the communion with spirits rep­resented a preparation fo r the individual's final ascent. In Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature, it was commonplace for the visionary to achieve angelic status.39 According to Sarah lles Johnston's analy­sis of late antique theurgic ascent, the theurgist underwent an experience that changed his status and relationship with his human peers, his divine superiors, or both. She distinguishes between the theurgist, whose ascent is for personal spiritual benefit, and the enraptured individual, who returns from his celestial journey with knowledge of significance fo r his society, which he undertakes to disseminate. While the author of the Liber de essentia spirituum derives personal spiritual benefits from his \"image of true light;' he also returns with a message of revelation and hope for a small group of the chosen, which appears to be an indication that, like many theurgists of late antiquity, he sought to build a small community of the blessed who had access to true knowledge of the cosmos.40 To some extent, narrative prologues to magic texts were intended to legiti­mize the techniques they described and impress upon the reader the book's powerful and sacred qualities. 41 Nevertheless, contemporary readers took them seriously. William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris (1228-49), fo cused on the teach­ing and assembling of fo llowers in his critique of the Liber de essentia spirituum in several chapters of his De universo (1231-36).42 He accuses its author of setting up schools of necromancy (\"scholas necromanticae\") and teaching the revela­tions of demons so that they could be encouraged by nefarious cults (\"nefariis"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 85 cultibus\"). His attack on this text identifies the spirits with whom the author cohabits as demons, not only because of the content of what they teach-an art execrable and hateful to God-but also because of their descent into the desert, a vile habitation. 43 Whereas the author of the Liber de essentia sp irituum asso­ciates living in deserted places with the rejection of worldly concerns, William provides the contrary perspective that it is madness to prefer the company of beasts, serpents, and dragons to that of men. He finds the prophetiC tone of this author threatening, as if his proclaimed piety were likely to attract fo llowers or had already done so. The asceticism of this man in the desert is not to be trusted, since \"what goodness or piety is to be believed of them, who cannot be ignorant of such great needs of men, such great other miseries and ignorances of them and <nevertheless> have betaken themselves so far away from them ?\"44 The revelation conveyed by the author of the Book of the Spirits in Corpus Christi 125 is not a visual rendering of an ascent but rather knowledge of the workings of the cosmos he has acquired from his celestial companions. This revelation of heavenly secrets to an enraptured visionary is in the tradition of wisdom and apocalyptic literatures, which often included summaries of infor­mation on creation, cosmology, angelology, and knowledge of the orbits of the stars and of their angelic guides. 45 The main elements of the received knowledge in the Liber de essentia spirituum concern the nature of God and the intermedi­ary spirits between God and man, the descent to earth of some of these spirits, and their incorporation into material objects or bodies.46 To those deemed wor­thy, the author offers a description not only of the true state of the cosmos-that is, of the hierarchy of spirits descending from the One-but also of how this in­fo rmation can be used for the purpose of magical practice. This juxtaposition of cosmology and magic offers a theological insight into the operator's perspective that magic texts of a more purely pragmatic orienta­tion do not. First, the cosmology provides a justificatory framework fo r magical practice, describing a detailed spiritual hierarchy and arguing that the spirits descend according to God's will and that their assistance in magical actions fol­lows the law of creation. Second, although it is not explicitly stated, the magical techniques may be intended for use in theurgic rituals to achieve the soul's tem­porary ascent. Finally, those who are among the elect may be deemed worthy to receive not only knowledge of the true nature of God and his spirits but also techniques fo r gaining access to spiritual assistance and terrestrial power. The spirits are compelled to obey a practitioner who can demonstrate his knowledge of the secrets of the universe; thus the cosmology enables, explains, and justifies the practice of magic.

This angel, in turn, endowed the practitioner with the ability to understand cosmic secrets embedded in the TorahY Like the narrator of the Liber de essentia spirituum, the scholar who received this revelation became a powerful holy man, even a wonder worker. As will be seen, analogues fo r other aspects of the magical cosmology of the Liber de essentia spirituum are evident in the Liber Razielis. 3· Adam and the Recovery of Prelapsarian Knowledge in the Liber Razielis The narrative framework of the Liber Razielis involves the transmission of a ce­lestial book rather than a cohabitation of spirits and man, but there are interest­ing parallels with the Liber de essentia spirituum.48 The celestial book is given to Adam by the angel Raziel shortly after his expulsion from paradise; that is, in a newly wretched state of corporality and suffering that stands in harsh contrast to his previous existence.49 On the banks of the river Paraig, outside Eden, Adam prays to God, and, in his mercy for his creation's pitiful postlapsarian state, God sends the angel Raziel with a book that gives him knowledge of the workings of the heavens and earth and great powers. 5° And on the third day of his praying, a good angel named Raziel (and the explanation of it [the name] is: \"angel\" and \"the head\" of all secrets and knowledge) came to Adam and he had come to him by command of the Creator. And Adam was then standing on the banks of the river which flowed from Paradise, which is called Perat,51 and he was troubled and pitiful, sad and weeping aloud, and the angel appeared to him in the hour in which the sun begins to heat up the earth. And in the hand of the angel was the likeness of a book of white fire, written in red, blue, and black fire and unlike any other colors. 52 And the angel said to Adam: \"Why are you sad and suffering, and why do you think over the future in your heart? Because in the hour in which you had risen onto your feet to make a prayer to the Creator, and had petitioned and invoked him and humbled yourself and thrown yourself onto the ground to pour out prayers and tormented your heart, then were your words received. And your prayer was received and completed. And the Creator immediately ordered me to descend and go to you with this book in order to teach you to understand"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 8 7 the pure words and knowledge which are in it, and the many sciences and secrets which are in it, and the profound and precious writing which is in it. And you should know that all the beings which God created hold this book in the highest value and hold it to be evident and holy:'53 The gift of the book occurs at the time when man has just lost his closest and purest terrestrial contact with the divine. Many late medieval ritual-magic texts sought to recover this contact, sometimes combining this goal with an expres­sion of yearning for the prelapsarian state of purity, knowledge, and experience of the presence of God. A prayer in the Ars notoria, for example, requests \"love, whereby you drew fallen mankind to heaven; learning, whereby you thought it worthy to teach Adam all of the sciences ... that I may be made new ... in receiving the science which is beneficial fo r my soul and body.\"54 The Liber iura­tus claims that through it the operator will know God in his majesty in the same way that Adam and the prophets did. 55 According to the prologue to the Liber Sameyn, after the Fall, Adam lost all the goodness and wisdom he had possessed and fell from knowledge into igno­rance. 56 The Liber Razielis is a revelation of the lost prelapsarian wisdom, which enables man to acquire knowledge of all corporeal and spiritual causes. 57 When Adam fell into mortality, his imprisonment within time resulted in a new igno­rance of the future. In his prayer to God outside paradise, before the book is given back to him, he begs: \"Let me understand and know once again what will become of my children and future generations and what will become of me in all the days and months of the world:'58 Although Adam had fallen, as an exemplar fo r the magical practitioner he remained physically and emotionally close to paradise, and the Liber virtutis included the Semyforas that Adam used to speak with God in Eden. 59 The angel Raziel promises Adam, and by extension the operator of the magic text, spiritual advancement in the celestial hierarchy, just as the author of the Liber de essentia sp irituum claimed to have spiritual companions and to include himself among the blessed. Different versions of the text explore this in different ways. In the BnF, lat. 3666 prologue, whoever finds the book will be blessed (\"beatus homo qui invenit librum istum\"), for \"he will be restored to life so that he sits in the presence of the angel, since the Holy Spirit rests on him.\"60 The operator of the book will increase his ability to understand the true God and the separation of the rational soul,61 and, like the author of the Liber de essentia spirituum, whoever has power through knowing this book can reveal it to others and thus raise up and bring down many men.62 In the Halle and Vatican manu­scripts, Adam is endowed with visionary powers on earth, acquires the grace and love of angels, and will ultimately be transformed as if he were one of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"88 INVOKING ANGELS celestial beings.63 A sixteenth-century copy of the text (Firenze, Plot. 44, Cod. 33) emphasizes a more sacred visionary power, and the angels are treated as ser­vants rather than as fr iends.64 As the book passes down through the generations from Seth to Enoch, to his son Lemach, and then to Noah in the narrative prologue of BnF, lat. 3666, the angelic contact continues to be renewed. Enoch, who had \"intromisit se in intel­lectu Domini nostri,\" underwent a ritual of cleansing prayer and afterward an angel appeared to him while he was sleeping and revealed the secret location of the book. As Enoch read and understood the Liber Razielis, he began to re­semble the saints and angels and was thought to have ascended to heaven. He was even thought to have entered paradise, although he remained on the celes­tial plane teaching and using the book: And from the hour in which he had understood its words, he was clothed in a great splendor, and the vision of his eyes doubled, and he focused and absorbed himself so much in all the ways of this book that finally he re­sembled the saints in heaven and had separated himself from earthly habi­tation. And he could not be fo und, fo r he had been transported and elevated to heaven with the power of an angel. And there are such people who said that his sense or understanding was valued by and assimilated to the an­gels of heaven and he was led into Paradise with his mortal body.65 How far could th e late medieval operators of the Liber Razielis hope to imi­tate the example of Enoch and ascend to heaven in their purified mortal bodies? The last chapter of the Liber Sameyn claims that this book teaches, among other things, how anyone should operate in order to be like one of the prophets of the earth or one of the angels of heaven and to be led away from damnation and toward salvation.66 The Liber iuratus is equally explicit as to its goals: \"This is the book by which God can be seen in this life. This is the book by which anyone can be saved and led, beyond a doubt, into eternal life. This is the book in which hell and purgatory can be seen without death:'67 These goals are usually implicit rather than attached to particular operations, and to some extent they are part of the rhetoric by which the operator is said to be spiritually transformed by his knowledge and manipulation of the medieval universe. Although the Liber iura­tus and the Liber vision urn offer specific instructions for achieving the vision of God, this still depends on the operator's fa ith, and he may be repulsed.68 Salva­tion itself-a sensitive topic, as Porphyry admits in The City of God-is not usu­ally attached to a particular ritual. An interesting exception is found in the magic text titled Almandal, however. Here the operator is blessed with grace and saved from damnation after speaking to an angel of the first altitude he has conjured"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 89 to appear by means of the almandal (a wax tablet, table, or altar). 69 As the Liber de essentia spirituum and Liber Razielis also proposed, speaking to angels leads to the perfection of the human being and is a sign that he has achieved the nec­essary purification to ascend. The Liber Razielis has built-in textual safeguards, however, to ensure that the .. perfecting\" of the human being it describes does not imply a \"deification\" of human nature. This point is discussed in an important article by Jean-Patrice Boudet and Julien Veronese that compares the prologues and narrative schemes of the Clavicula Salomonis, the Liber Razielis, the Ars notoria, and the LiberAl­mandal, all of which can be categorized within the genre of Solomonic magic. Boudet and Veronese argue that by postulating a divine origin for their revela­tions, Solomonic magic texts express how much is hidden from man and how great the gulf is between God and his most perfect creatures. The fruits of reve­lation are fragile and can be taken away: Solomon and, to some extent, Adam are archetypal tragic examples of how knowledge can be merited and lost. When revelation does not ensure a transformation in human nature as well as human knowledge, it is, as Boudet and Veronese put it, \"comme un don qui tient du mirage:'70 In the two texts under consideration here, however, salvation, rather than deification, is intended to provide a permanent state of wisdom and human perfection. Moreover, the ephemeral nature of revelation is to some extent side­stepped in the Liber Razielis by the provision of a ritual (discussed below) to invoke angelic teachers who will provide a revelation fo r each new operator.71 4· Spirits and Man: The Elevation of the Practitioner When the purified theurgist's soul \"welcomes spirits and angels and sees gods; as Augustine puts it in The City of God, this could be interpreted as either the ascent of the practitioner to the celestial realm or the descent of spirits or the divine to the practitioner-even into the practitioner's soul. This interaction created an elevated status and transformed the physical state of the practitioner. The precedent of Adam's celestial contact, in which the angel Raziel taught him the power of the book, is meant to be repeated by every practitioner who \"re­discovers\" the lost book. After the description of the angel Raziel ascending to heaven in celestial flames in BnF, lat. 3666, an experiment is recorded that each operator (here called the \"artifex\") of the book must undertake.72 This experi­ment involves seven days of ritual cleansing, the sacrifice of two white doves, and the naming of angels assigned to the appropriate month. After three days the operator is instructed to sleep in the ashes of the burned intestines of the doves in a house that has burning candles in its fo ur parts.

This positive gloss is not entirely consistent with the goals of the Liber de essentia spirituum, the Liber Razielis, and to some extent also the Liber iuratus, because they also contain descriptions of malefic spirits, rituals involving sacrifice, and the subjugation and imprisonment of spirits, and have harmful and materialistic goals (although arguably these could be intended to punish the enemies of the elect). The sinister or amoral spirits manipulated by practitioners in these texts include the malicious spirits of Mars and the licentious spirits of Venus in the Liber de essentia spirituum, the pitiless angels of the second army of the first heaven in the Liber Sameyn, 80 and the spirits of the earth \"qui sunt turpissimi et omni pravitate pleni\" in the Liber iuratus.8I Here the practitioner engages with the full cosmological range of spirits, not just those that can act as mediators to the divine. Interestingly, the Liber de essentia spirituum explains this interaction with a level of amoral spirits by stressing their comparability to (and consequent sympathy fo r) man. These spirits also suffer from passibilitas, sharing the pas­sions that infect man, and imprisoning them in objects is said to place them in a position comparable to the human soul suffering the prison of the body."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 91 The Liber Razielis includes a range of magical techniques, from the invocation and inscription of angelic names on a folio, image, or ring, to the use of animal parts (such as the head of a black cat that has never seen the light) and prayers that emphasize the humility and piety of the operator. There are numerous ritu­als of ablution and abstinence and places in the text where the operator is re­quired to be pure, God-fearing, and clean; but he is also able to do experiments for good or evil ends. The emphasis on ritual purity expresses the instrumental power of ablution and abstinence and provides a link to the ideal figures of the prologues, whose repentance, purity, or wisdom the operator is expected to emulate. Purification is also necessary before any contact with the divine. In the Liber mundicie ets abstinentie, the fifth book of the Alfonsine Liber Razielis, the fell owship of angels and spiritual ascent are explicitly linked to instructions for purification. If the operator fulfils the requirements fo r internal and external purity described in this book, he will ascend to a spiritual level separated from earthly things and be loved by angels. 82 Cleanliness makes a man holy and draws the spirits to him as companions who will tell him secrets. 83 In both the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spirituum, spirits are cat­egorized and invoked more in terms of their position in a celestial structure and their relationship to terrestrial objects, people, emotions, actions, creatures, time, and space than in terms of their relationship with the divine. Chapter 37 of the Liber temporum lists different ways of binding parts of the natural order, from fire, rain, ice, and hail, to seeds, trees, birds, beasts, and reptiles, which all have angels ruling over them. The Liber de essentia spirituum evokes a world in which \"everything that moves has spirits assigned to it that perpetually traverse the paths from the summit of the creator:'84 In its cosmology, spirits are perpetu­ally falling into creation. According to William of Auvergne's critique of this text, each part of the sea or earth where a spirit fa lls was said to be imbued with its power: deserts, woods, fo untains, rivers, herbs, trees, orchards, and even gems and precious stones.85 Texts like the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spiri­tuum combined a late antique spiritual cosmology of a type especially prevalent in Jewish angelology, in which spiritual beings are represented as ruling over all the parts of the terrestrial world, with an astrological scheme in which celestial bodies are represented as ruling over man and the physical world. It is difficult to categorize either text exclusively as \"angelic magic\" (the purest exemplars of \"itich are works of Christian authorship or works that adhere to Christian sen­sibilities about angels and supplication to the divine) or as \"astral magic\" (texts in which the spirits of celestial bodies are invoked, usually pertaining to the Her­metic tradition).86 As in Antonio da Montolmo's De occultis et manifestis (the subject of Nicolas We ill-Parot's chapter in this volume), both types of cosmology are evident in combination."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92 INVOKING ANGELS In their conjunction of spiritual advancement and magic techniques, these texts address an underlying problem: how to enjoy earthly pleasures \\\\i.thout being corrupted by them, and how to free the soul to ascend to heaven and ac­quire salvation. Rather than excising or diminishing aggressive or material goals and subjugating techniques, the texts endow the practitioner with the elect's right to power over spirits, although traces of anxiety still emerge: in one prayer the practitioner asks the angels not to record anything negative about him.87 Conclusion Given its length and advertised status as a sacred book of celestial origin, it is not surprising that the Liber Razielis traveled alone.88 However, the seven-volume format of the Alfonsine version and the probably separate origins of individual texts resulted in the independent circulation of several parts of the compilation. In Miinchen, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 51, only the sixth and seventh books of the Liber Razielis were copied, a choice probably dictated by the cos­mological elements in these texts and the desire to omit the comparatively unsophisticated astrological material of parts of the first five books. The last two Liber Razielis books are the only magic texts in Clm 51, and a later hand added the disapproving annotation \"superstisiosus est\" above the title of the Liber Sameyn. 89 Two copies of a work entitled Liber Razielis quem misit dominus ad Adam were held at St. Augustine's Abbey, the first in a volume of astrological and astronomical texts (no. 1151) and the other in a more miscellaneous volume (no. 1137) that included astrological and astronomical items, the De ornatu mu­lierum, and two popular literary works, the Narratio de Appollonio and the Pic­taleon. The last volume provides a rare example of a ritual magic text compiled with literary texts, which suggests that the reader could have viewed the detailed and unorthodox angelic hierarchy it contains as a work of fantasy. On the other hand, this mingling of practical, esoteric, and popular literary items was typi­cal of the kinds of interests revealed in the late medieval personal compilations known as commonplace books. The Jewish origin and the compilatory nature of the copies of the Liber Ra­zielis in circulation make it something of a hybrid, incorporating elements of natural magic, astral magic (predominantly Arabic in origin), and ritual magic (written by a Christian or adhering to Christian sensibilities). Elements of all these magical genres appear in the corpus of surviving texts. Even the second book of the Alfonsine Liber Razielis, which focuses on the natural powers of stars, stones, herbs, animal parts, and words, also discusses fo ur groups of spir­its, under the category \"animabilis igne:' This conjunction of interests makes the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"UPLIFTING SOULS 93 Alfonsine Liber Razielis, in the forms discussed here, an early precursor of (as well as frequent possible source for) not only the early magical synthesis by An­tonio da Montolmo, discussed elsewhere in this volume, but also the sixteenth­century collections in which image magic and ritual magic texts were compiled together.90 The replacement of a text focusing on image magic with a text on the power of names in the most popular version in circulation is itself indicative of the growing popularity of ritual magic. Early modern manuscripts contain­ing the Liber Razielis are usually compiled in manuscripts with a predominance of ritual magic, and even start to take on the characteristic instability of ritual magic texts. As Firenze, Plut. 44, Cod. 33 notes on fol. 66v: \"Iste liber est con­mixtus cum libro psalmorum Rasielis et cum sancto Semaforas omnes in unum conmixti:' This chapter has considered the Liber Razielis and the Liber de essentia spiri­tuum in relative isolation from other works of learned magic, with the aim of increasing awareness of these two lesser-known texts and diverse approaches to magic in the late Middle Ages. The Liber Razielis in particular is a significant magical compilation; given the influence of Jewish texts on Christian ritual magic, it has not received the scholarly attention it deserves. In this chapter I have ex­plored themes suggested by the prologues in several Liber Razielis manuscripts, but more work needs to be done on how the Arabic, Jewish, and Christian tradi­tions related to and influenced each other.

The author seeks to explain and justify why a perfect and incorruptible first essence is also the creator of (and contained within) diverse, imperfect, and corruptible things. 17-23 The three levels of intermediary spirits between God and man. The high­est group of spirits are said to be incorruptible divine beings, like lights. A second level consists of the spirits ruling over the spheres of the seven planets and the ruler of Urania, the outermost sphere of the universe. The third and most significant group of spirits, for the purposes of magical practice, are those inhabiting and ruled over by each of the planetary spheres. A close relationship is construed between the spirits' degree of passibilitas (their susceptibility to passions and suffering) and their in­fluence upon and potential to be influenced by man, particularly in the sense of astrological influence and magical persuasion and compulsion. 24-33 The descent to earth of the lowest level of spirits under the rule of each of the planets. This is primarily discussed in terms of the spirits' influence on man in particular ages ruled over by the spirits' planet, and the magi­cal practices appropriate to each group. 34-42 The incorporation of fallen or invoked spirits into matter. Spirits impris­oned in matter (general instructions for which are given in the text) are compared to human souls trapped in the prison of the body. The discus­sion of the pitiful state of the soul here seems to relate to the author's bleak vision of the condition of mankind on earth at the beginning of the text 43-45 'The variety of the descent of spirits. The beginning of a section on the variety of the \"sending in'' (immissioni.s) of spirits. Only the descent and nature of the spirits of Saturn and Jupiter are described before the text breaks off abruptly.

Unless otherwise indicated, all translations in this chapter are my own. 1. The style of the Liber de essentia sp irituum suggests that it is an original composition in Latin rather than a translation, and it is therefore probably of Christian authorship. As discussed below, however, it does not present any specifically Christian fe atures. 3· A significant text that also falls into this category, the Picatrix, has been discussed elsewhere. See Vittoria Perrone Compagni, \"Picatrix latin us: Concezioni filosofico-religiose e prassi magica;' Me­dioevo 1 (1975): 237-70; and David Pingree, \"Some of the Sources oft he GMyat ai-Hakim;' Jo urnal of rhe Wa rburg and Courtauld Institutes 43 (1980): 1-15. 4· There are some similarities in the descriptions of the cosmological context, appearance, and oanue of spirits between the I.iber Razielis and the second and third tracts of the Liber iuratus, which was derived from Jewish sources, as Mesler notes. The names recited and recorded inside the notae in tbe .-\\rs notoria function similarly as tools of power, but the other types of prayer and the figurative .1KigCls pointing at the notae in many manuscript copies signify the mediating role of these beings."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"106 INVOKING ANGELS 5· For example, the prayer cycles recited over months in the ritual program of the Ars notoria. The Ars notoria is primarily a revelation of the techniques necessary to attain knowledge, but the Liber de essentia spirituum and the Liber Razielis present themselves as the celestial or prelapsarian knowl­edge itself. 6. The title given to this work in Coxe's catalogue (and, for convenience, adopted here) derives from a marginal note in a later hand, that of John Dee, the English Renaissance magician.

An argument for the original integrity of the seven volumes, however, is suggested by some internal consistencies and cross-references. For example, the categorization of the animals of fire (\"angeli, spiritus, anime, venti, demones fantasmata et demones sompnorum\") in the Liber temporum, chapter 32, is the same as that of the Liber Ale, chap­ter 5. The Liber Sameyn refers to \"lapidibus preciosis quos diximus in libro de sciencia lapidum\" (Vat. Reg. lat. 1300, fol. 98), and the Liber magice to the \"libri temporum et celorum\" (fol. 2oov). 11.

Although Willianl does not mention an author, date, or title for this work, it is dearly recognizable from his descriptions of its contents. It seems that William had access to a complete copy of the text, which discussed twelve orders of spiritual substances (the CC 125 copy breaks off after only eight have been mentioned), and he also refers to other books on this topic by the same author (11.3.6). 43. \"Ex hoc autem manifestum est eos fuisse spiritos malignos vel malos Angelos, quia in deserto habitabant, sicut ipse dicit quomodo enim sponte in loco horrido, et vilissimo habitabant, si locus habitationis erat eis sublimior, atque nobilior in caelo ultimo, ubi inhabitabat Rex, et dominus saecu­lorum cum innumeris excercitibus sanctorum spirituum, et beatorum?

Other traditions of God sending angels to teach men include Jewish sources representing Soah as a recipient of angelic healing traditions (see Swartz, Scholastic Magic, 192-93), Christian apoc­ryphal writings concerning the archangel Michael showing Adam how to till the soil, and Seth being guided by an angel as he records a history of his parents. For examples, see Brian Murdoch, Adams Grace: Fall and Redemption in Medieval Literature (Cambridge: D. S.

The main topos for a book written in different colored fires is the Torah, which was said in an early midrash to have been delivered to Moses \"written in black fire on white fire\" before the creation of the world. See Gershom Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Sy mbolism, trans. Ralph Manheim (New York: Schocken Books, 1965), 49· The book ofRaziel is therefore established by simile as a redemptive sacrament parallel to the Torah and delivered in the same manner. Some thirteenth-century interpre­�ons suggested that the hidden text of the white fire (on which the black fire was merely a commen­tary) would be revealed in messianic times. In the context of the Liber Razielis, this distinction may refer to the text acquired from human transmission of knowledge and the true understanding of it �ed through spiritual experience. 53· \"Et in tertia die sue orationis venit ad Adam angelus benignus qui nominatur Raziel et expla­oatio eius est <est> angelus et caput tocius secrete et sciencie, et venit ad ipsum per mandatum Cre­.uoris.

It was a generally accepted aspect of Christian cosmology and a practice long considered forbidden.1 But what about angels? While they could be the objects of prayers and were occasionally accorded an intercessory role similar to that of the saints, the notion of magically summoning an angel and constraining it to obedience was rather unorthodox and, for most Christians, quite unthinkable. Yet a work of learned magic known as the Sworn Book of Honorius, which circulated in two versions from at least the fourteenth century, teaches techniques not only for invoking angels but also for conjuring and commanding them. 2 One of the prescribed rituals begins with weeks of fast­ing and abstinence, careful preservation of moral and ritual purity, steadfast at­tendance at masses, and nearly incessant prayer. A set of ritual objects, including a piece of parchment bearing the name of God, is then taken to a secluded circle of stones. After the proper prayers, suffumigations, and genuflections, the angels are addressed: I thus invoke you, powerful angels, and by invoking, I conjure you. I mightily command the ruling powers of the heavenly majesty, by him ... and by his ineffable name ... at the sound of which all the celestial, ter­restrial, and infernal hosts tremble and worship [cf. Philem. 2:10], and by these names, which are Rethala, Rabam, Cauthalee, Durhulo, Archyma, I ,.-ould like to thank Jan Bulman, Courtney Kneupper, Robert E. Lerner, Jesse Njus, Dylan C.

Veenstra for their invaluable suggestions."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"114 INVOKING ANGELS Rabur, that by the spheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mer­cury, and the Moon, at every occasion, without malice, in a benevolent form, and placated by my small gift, you shall deign to descend ... within the circles inscribed here, ready to obey me in all lawful and worthy requests.3 As suggested by the invocation, the ritual is supposed to end with the appear­ance of an angel, who will obediently carry out the wishes of the conjurer. One can only speculate about whether anyone in the Middle Ages actually attempted to follow this complicated and laborious procedure through to its end, fo r most of the fe w existing accounts of this text were written by detractors who condemned the work as demonic. Nor do we know anything about the un­doubtedly pseudonymous author \"Honorius\"4 other than a fe w general details discernible from internal textual evidence. Emerging research, however, sug­gests that this text and its author were more popular (or notorious) than the scanty references would lead us to believe. And even had it not been so well known, the text would remain significant on account of the remarkable evi­dence it provides for two notable developments in the cultural history of late medieval European Christendom. First, the text represents an important stage in the history of medieval magic. If the rituals described are not entirely original or unique to the Sworn Book, the text nonetheless exemplifies certain practices and ideas that were developing within the Christian magical tradition. Indeed, Honorius's treatise challenges contemporary assumptions about magic and thus plays a significant role in the larger context of legal and theological debates over the status of magical prac­tices. Second, the Sworn Book provides a striking example of a type of cultural transmission and adaptation that was becoming more common in the period. The reception and influence oflslamic ideas in the Latin West has long occupied historians such as Lynn Thorndike, Charles Homer Haskins, David Pingree, and Charles Burnett.5 Magical texts such as the Sworn Book, however, pose particu­lar problems fo r evaluating the reception of ideas from Arabic and Hebrew sources, for we know very little about the author, the context of composition, or any direct textual sources. But I would like to propose that at least one element of this text -the role and representation of angels-can offer us insight into the author's appropriation of Jewish and Islamic magical practices fo r a purportedly Christian purpose. This approach offers suggestive perspectives on the ways in which the Sworn Book attests to an awareness of cultural transmission, demon­strates both direct and indirect influences from these external sources, and pro­vides unique evidence for understanding attitudes toward such borrowing."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE LIBBR IURATUS HONORII 115 1. The Sworn Book: Textual Traditions and Dating The most important advance in research on the Sworn Book is Jan Ve enstra's identification (in chapter 4 of this volume) of two separate textual traditions. The first, hitherto unknown to scholars, was transmitted in Spain by Berengario Ganell in his magical compendium the Summa sacre magice. Although this ver­sion was certainly affected by the personality of the redactor,-it nevertheless appears to preserve certain fe atures ofHonorius's original text.6 The second and later textual tradition of the Sworn Book, which has been the basis fo r all previ­ous work on the text, is known from a few manuscripts compiled in England and now preserved in the British Library in London.7 Since this version is avail­able in Gosta Hedegard's Latin edition, it is this latter tradition that has been the basis of my treatment here, although much of my analysis may apply equally to both versions. The London redaction of the Sworn Book is divided into a prologue and five sections. The prologue recounts a dramatic narrative concerning the work's composition. As the story goes, the pope and other high-ranking church offi­cials have been manipulated by demons into believing that the magical arts are evil. In the face of impending persecution, and out of fe ar that their art would be lost, a council of magicians gathered to preserve the secrets of magic. They chose Honorius to commit this magical knowledge to writing, and he did so with the help of an angel named Hocrohel. The magicians then swore an oath to protect the secrets contained in the book, and therefore it is known as the \"sworn'' book. 8 lhis prologue evokes the historiolae common in pseudepigraphal and magical texts, in which the account of the text's origin, often describing how it was handed down from biblical figures, attests to its authenticity and authority. But however historically implausible this account may be, it provides invaluable evi­dence for determining the date of composition and offers explicit commentary on contemporary attitudes toward magic. Historians have contested the dating of the Sworn Book. Jan Ve enstra suggests that a date in the early fo urteenth century remains plausible, but he cautions that there is nothing to rule out a point of origin in the thirteenth century. Evi­dence that depends on textual details particular to the London version suggests a date fo r the redaction of that version most probably during the pontificates of John XXII (1316-34) or his successor, Benedict XII (1334-42). These textual de­tails include an emphasis on attaining the beatific vision, incorporation of ma­terial from the Ars notoria, polemics directed against Jews rather than Muslims, and a prologue reframing the myth of the text's origin in a time period when magic was under a newly heightened attack from the church.9 Since all of these"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"116 INVOKING ANGELS elements play a role in my analysis, it is worth reassessing the evidence for dat­ing, both to establish the likely parameters for the text's composition and to confirm the dating of the London tradition with greater certainty. Initial arguments for an early thirteenth-century date were based largely on a Liber sacratus mentioned by William of Auvergne, who was bishop of Paris from 1228 to 1249.10 There is, however, no clear indication that he was referring to any version of the Sworn Book under discussion in this volume; as Richard Kieckhe­fe r has already noted, there are many books that might have been characterized as \"consecrated\" or \"sworn:'11 Concerning the London tradition, new evidence from the doctoral dissertation ofJulien Veronese on the Ars notoria conclusively rules out such an early date, fo r he has shown that the prayers in the London Sworn Book depend on the later glossed version of the Ars notoria-a third re­cension of this text, which postdates both an earlier glossed version and the original unglossed version.12 While this evidence is absent from the tradition rep­resented in Ganell, so that there is nothing conclusively to rule out a thirteenth­century date of origin, it remains questionable whether a work originating in Spain even in the early part of thirteenth century could have been in circulation in northern France as early as the 1240s. The writings of John of Morigny provide further evidence that the Sworn Book tradition probably does not date much earlier than 13oo.B In particular, there is no indication that John, who wrote between 1301 and 1315, knew the Sworn Book, even though he knew the Ars notoria in the glossed version (and probably in the unglossed version as well), and he mentions several other magic texts.14 Thus the circumstantial evidence from the Liber florum generally sup­ports the possibility that the Sworn Book was not in wide circulation in northern France before 1316. The earliest known manuscript of this version dates to the first half of the fo urteenth century.15 Nevertheless, a later date for the London version seems unlikely, fo r there is good reason to trace the redaction of the Sworn Book to the papal reign of John XXII or Benedict XII. Either one could have been envisaged as the target of the prologue's polemics, as both men devoted considerable energy to arraigning suspected sorcerers.16 But the fact that only one pope is mentioned in the story may indicate that it was in fact during John's pontificate that the Sworn Book was redacted. This assumption is supported by an additional piece of circumstantial evidence related to the text's emphasis on the beatific vision.17 John XXII caused an uproar during the last few years of his pontificate (1331-34) when he began preaching that the vision of God could not be obtained until after the Final Judgment. He recanted on his deathbed and the matter was officially settled two years later in Benedict's encyclical Benedictus Deus (1336), which supported the common opinion that the elect would experience the vision immediately after"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 117 death.18 The issue was, perhaps, never so high-profile, and thus the centrality of the beatific vision in the London version of the Sworn Book may reflect the re­dactor's awareness of the controversy. But while John and his opponents differed on how soon after death the vision would be seen, 19 the first section of the Sworn Book, which constitutes more than half of the complete text, is specifically devoted to a position that is more remi­niscent of the one condemned at the Council ofVienne (1311-12): attainment of the vision during life, by one's own efforts-in this case, by means of a magical ritual. 20 This portion of the text consists of several parts: instructions for creat­ing the \"sigil of God;' which is a magical seal used in the rituals;21 a listing of several prayers, which are recited in various sequences throughout the remain­der of the text; a ritual for obtaining a dream vision to learn if one has God's permission to proceed with the operation; and the performance of the ritual, lasting an extra seventy-two days, that leads to the beatific vision.22 2. \"Honorius\": Background and Influences Even if John XXII or the Council of Vienne provided some inspiration for the emphasis on the beatific vision, it was another source that shaped the content. It is this first section of the text, dealing with the beatific vision, in which Kieck­hefer recognized strong traces of Jewish thought.23 Lacking evidence fo r any direct textual source, he nonetheless identified several elements in the treatise that, whether directly or indirectly, ultimately attest to the influence of Jewish mysticism and magic-in particular, similarities with the Hekhalot literature of Merkavah mysticism and the mystical techniques of Abraham Abulafia. These include the work's goal of viewing God during life, the emphasis on moral and ritual purity as a prerequisite for magical practices, the magical use of a seal on which the name of God is written, the ritual attainment of dream visions, and a suggestion in the prologue that the book should be buried rather than de­stroyed.24 To the evidence noted by Kieckhefer we might add Honorius's ex­planation of Exodus 33:20, which is reminiscent of a kabbalistic interpretation mentioned by Nachmanides,25 as well as the repeated assertion of seeing the \"celestial palace;' which, although certainly not unknown in Christian thought, is a central motif of Hekhalot literature.26 In addition, Jean-Patrice Boudet has emphasized the potential ofJewish influence in the use of the seventy-two-letter name of God, as found in magical texts of Jewish influence such as the Liber Razielis, 27 and in the linguistic features of certain angelic names. 28 The second, third, and fourth sections of the Sworn Book take on a very dif­fe rent tone from the first part of the work. These three sections focus on the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"118 INVOKING ANGELS conjuring of planetary angels, aery angels, and terrestrial angels, respectively. Sections two and three are parallel in structure, providing information about the spirits and then describing the ritual used to summon them, which is based in part on the ritual for the beatific vision. The fourth section, though following the same general structure, is radically abridged and lacks the detail of the sec­ond and third parts. There is also a fifth section, which is somewhat conspicuous in both content and prose style. It repeats earlier details, providing clarification on a few points of ritual from the first and third sections, and then offers a brief conclusion to the work. The evidence suggests that this section was not part of the original version of the Sworn Book. 29 In comparison to the ritual for the be­atific vision, these final portions of the Sworn Book have received little scholarly attention. I will demonstrate, however, that these sections are not only inno­vative in their appropriation of Jewish and Islamic elements but also have wide implications with respect to the historical context of the fourteenth century. Much less is known about the original author, and even the little that can be discerned is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing him from later re­dactors. Only further textual analysis may resolve this difficulty. At present, I will continue to speak generally of Honorius, with the understanding that his \"personality;' as preserved in the London tradition, is a combination of the orig­inal author and an unknown number of redactors. The question of Honorius's language skills is of particular interest when considering the influence of works in languages other than Latin. On the one hand, he discusses etymologies from Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek, which may derive from some personal acquaintance with these languages. 30 On the other hand, a misspelling of the tetragrammaton as \"ioth, he, vau, deleth'' appears to confirm that he is no skilled Hebraist.31 Veen­stra has shown that this particular error can probably be imputed to a redactor and thus may not be characteristic of all stages in the production of the Sworn Book, but scrutiny of the text ultimately reveals no conclusive evidence for knowledge of these languages. Additional evidence from the text sheds light on Honorius's level of education. Throughout the text, he incorporates-and occasionally alters (whether inten­tionally or inadvertently)-passages from scripture,32 the baptismal rite,33 the preface for Easter,34 the Ave Maria,35 the Salve Regina,36 the Apostle's Creed,37 the Pater Noster,38 the Sanctus,39 and the Creed of Athanasius.40 He also para­phrases quotations from one of Jerome's letters41 and from Pseudo-Augustine's Sermon Against Je ws, Pagans, and Arians. 42 The latter passage may have been taken from other sources that quote it, such as Gregory the Great,43 Peter Da­mian,44 Peter Lombard,45 or Richard of St. Victor,46 but it attests all the same to Honorius's familiarity with church writings. Other references are specifically attributed to Solomon, among them a distorted version ofSirach (\"It is better to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 119 remain in caves with a bear and a lion than with a wicked woman\")47 and an­other quotation that is not as readily identifiable (\"There is only m�e God, the only power, the only faith\").48 In addition, the angel Samael is said to have told Solomon, \"I shall give this to your people Israel, and they shall similarly grant it to others:'49 These phrases may simply be Honorius's own innovations or rem­nants of other magical texts he had read. That they all appear in close proximity to one another suggests the possibility that this part of the text may represent an adaptation from another source. In any case, it is clear that Honorius had a solid knowledge of magical texts. This is certainly true of the redactor, who had access to a glossed version of the Ars notoria at the time he copied the Sworn Book. From this internal evidence, it is safe to assume that the original author and the redactors were members of the learned clergy and thus belonged to the \"'clerical underworld\" identified by Kieckhefer.50 While increasing evidence suggests that such magicians need not be imagined as solitary figures whose magical pursuits were unknown to others,51 it is nonetheless difficult to say much more about Honorius, except perhaps in terms of geography. Veenstra's essay establishes Spain as the most likely place of original composition, and this theory appears to be supported by the known movement of the text. In a trial from 1347, we learn that Berengaria Ganell, who was from Spain, personally sold Etienne Pepin a copy of the book near Perpignan sometime between 1324 and 1344.52 Pepin responded in the trial that he had recently sent the book to Gua­rino de Castronovo in Vabres (Haute-Loire). 53 Although this is our clearest in­dication of the movement of the text from Spain to France, we cannot rule out the likelihood that other copies were already in circulation {indeed, we can imagine that this was not the only copy Ganell sold). In fact, Pepin claimed to have heard of the book before acquiring his own copy. Next, there is an indica­tion in the writings of the inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric that a copy was found in Aragon at some point between 1357 and 1375. It was not until1389, and again in 1398, that the Sworn Book was finally mentioned in Paris. 54 There is not enough evidence to conclude with certainty which version was present in the former case, but the 1398 account refers to the prologue and other contents of the Lon­don version. We may never know the identity of Honorius or the exact circumstances of the Sworn Book's composition, but much can still be gained from a textual study. The history of medieval Christian magic has been a growing field over the past fe w decades, but angel magic has until recently remained a largely overlooked aspect of the tradition. 55 The reigning narrative in the historiography of angelic invocations in late antiquity is that early Christians condemned invocations to angels in order to avoid idolatry and to distance themselves from the practices of so-called Gnostic groups. 56 This particular concern is addressed by the fourth-"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"120 INVOKING ANGELS century Council of Laodicea. 57 As the story goes, this mentality changed in the fourth to sixth centuries, owing mostly to Augustine and Gregory the Great; as one historian asserts, \"the invocation of angels has been a legitimate Christian practice ever since:•ss None of these studies accounts for the consistently non­Christian character of the angels invoked in magical contexts, or for the repeated condemnations of such angelic invocations that recur throughout the Middle Ages. In the most systematic treatment of early medieval angelic invocations to date, Valerie Flint provides numerous examples to argue that the practice was intentionally-almost officially-adapted in the early Middle Ages in order to preserve pagan spirit magic in a Christian form.59 Her examples tend to focus on prayers, pilgrimages, sacramental practices, and the cult of Saint Michael, the archangel. Contemporaries, however, would have characterized the healings and other effects resulting from these practices as \"miracles.\"60 Thus, while Flint is helpful in illuminating the early medieval Christian contexts in which angels were invoked, her work does not cast a direct light on the angelic texts of ritual magic that began to flourish in the thirteenth century. I argue that late medieval angel magic did not grow solely out of Christian practice, for aspects of it inher­ently contradicted Christian understandings of both angels and magic. Rather, it was the result of Jewish and, later, Islamic influence. Initially, this influence can be seen in rather isolated cases, which did not result in a continuing textual tradition oflearned angel magic within Christianity. But once Hebrew and Ara­bic magical texts became available in the Latin West, largely through Spain and Sicily, Christian magicians such as Honorius began to adapt the use of different kinds of angels into their own treatises of practical magic. 3· Conjuring Spirits The notion of commanding spirits had original grounding in the synoptic Gos­pels' accounts of exorcisms, which continued to be sanctioned for expelling de­mons from those thought to be possessed. It is little wonder, then, that medieval clerical necromancers adapted the same beliefs and rituals in hopes of compel­ling demons to grant other kinds of requests.61 In this respect the Sworn Book is no exception, for Honorius repeatedly asserts the same general assumptions about God's willingness to constrain spirits on beh�f of humans. What makes the text so remarkable, however, is the appropriation of these same formulas with regard to spirits that he specifically identifies as angels. In addition, the unusual length, complexity, and details of the operations reveal certain elements influenced by the Jewish and Islamic magical traditions."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 121 Perhaps the most important text of Christian angel magic to emerge in Eu­rope in the period preceding the Sworn Book was the Ars notoria. As mentioned earlier, the first section of the London version of the Sworn Book relies on many prayers copied verbatim from the later glossed version of the Ars notoria. 62 Thus, before undertaking a detailed analysis of the conjurations in the Sworn Book, it is important to establish the extent to which the types of angelic invocations used in the Sworn Book are intrinsically similar to that of the Ars notoria. 63 In the London version of the Sworn Book, the majority of angelic invocations drawn from the Ars notoria are addressed to God but call indirectly upon the power of the angels. Only rarely are the angels addressed more directly, as when the text reads, \"Be present, holy angels, pay heed, and inform me whether such person shall recover or die of this illness:'64 But even this statement could easily be un­derstood as beseeching, rather than commanding, the angels. Julien Veronese is correct, then, in asserting that the Ars notoria lacks an overt notion of constraint.65 In the first section of the Sworn Book, most directly dependent on the Ars notoria, God is entreated \"by your most holy angels,\" \"by all your holy and glorious archangels;' \"by the virtue of your holy angels and archangels; \"by the sight of your angels;' \"by the power ... of your holy angels;' �these precious sacraments of your angels,\" and \"by your angels and archan­gels, by the thrones and dominations, powers, principalities and virtues, by the dlerubim and seraphim.\"66 Only one invocation in this section of the Sworn Book lacks direct precedent in the Ars notoria: \"by the intercessions ... of your angels and archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael, and all other celes­tial angels:'67 It is worth noting that in all of these instances the text is referring to the \"celestial\" angels-that is, those of the nine orders, who, Honorius insists, .. serve only God\" and thus cannot be invoked or compelled. There are, however, three other types of angels: a lower group of celestial (or .. planetary\") angels, \"aery\" angels, and \"terrestrial\" angels.68 The following sec­tions of the Sworn Book provide detailed instructions for conjuring and subjugat­iog each of these types of angels, thus presenting a radical departure in premise from the prayers of the Ars notoria preserved in the first section. As will be seen, the mode of address to these types of spirits differs clearly from the address to the higher celestial spirits and from the Ars notoria. A common form of necromantic conjuration, as Richard Kieckhefer has demonstrated, consists of four main parts: an assertion of the conjuration (\"I conjure you\"), a ref erence to the identity of the spirits who are being addressed, �listing of the various powers invoked to constrain the spirits, and specific in­iiJUctions for the spirits to carry out.69 The conjurations in the Sworn Book cer­tainly follow this general pattern. As is typical, they are also accompanied by tbe performance of a prescribed ritual procedure. The simplest version of this"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"122 INVOKING ANGELS operation is found in the second section, which describes the procedure for con­juring those celestial angels who are associated with the planets, the sun, and the moon. The practitioner must first learn about the angels he wishes to conjure, prepare a magic cirde,1° conduct the ritual to determine whether he has God's permission to continue, and then spend several weeks attending masses and per­forming purification rites. During this time he persuades a priest to say prayers on his behalf beseeching Christ to constrain the angels.71 After the purification is complete, the three-day conjuration process begins. On the first day he should attend Mass, say certain prayers, and perform a benediction at the circle. On the second day he attends Mass again and performs certain benedictions and suf­fumigations at the circle. Then he addresses the angels by name, seeking to pac­ify them: \"In doing this [i.e., suffumigating], I offer you a small gift, so that you will be peaceful, patient, and calm, and will, by the intercession of God, kindly grant that which I seek:'72 Next, he draws two circles on the ground, inscribes the names of the angels around them, and then addresses the angels again: \"Come, all you, N .... I invoke you, N., as Zebedee ordered his sons to obey, [so too] may you come:•n On the third day he must wash and return to the circle with the seal of God. There he recites prayers and performs suffumigations and genuflections. Addressing God, he adds, \"May I be worthy to join in a friendly manner with your holy angels, who may, with your kind permission, be willing to thoroughly fulfill my just desires.\"74 He is now ready to begin the conjuration proper. The text separates the ritual into fo ur parts: the \"invocation,\" the \"seal and binding;' the \"conjuration;' and the \"placation:' Each consists of instructions, such as holding up the seal or drawing a cross on the ground, as well as numer­ous permutations of verbal fo rmulas that follow Kieckhefer's fr amework. The angels are addressed by long lists of names, various powers-often God's name­are called upon to constrain them/5 and they are instructed to be peaceful, hon­est, and obedient. There is an implicit danger in the operation, and the angels are enjoined to descend into the circle without malevolence, taking on a beneficent appearance and a pleasing demeanor.76 Further, the sigil of God is said to help \"render them harmless:'77 When they arrive, the practitioner is cautioned, the angels are not to be seen or addressed until after they have first spoken.78 No ex­planation of this practice is given. These angels are then constrained to obey the conjurer's wishes: \"A sk what you want, and you shall have it.\"79 In theory, these angels will obey only \"lawful and upright\" requests.80 Honorius offers such sug­gestions as seeking knowledge of heaven, changing day into night or night into day, or consecrating a book. 81 However, previous descriptions of the angels indi­cate that some of them, in fact, specialize in harmful or questionable activities. 82 The conjuration of the aery angels in the third section of the Sworn Book fol­lows the same pattern, although it is longer and more complicated. There are, for"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 123 example, spirits of the winds and a set of demons that must be invoked as part of the operation, and they too are constrained by various powers. 83 This may be one reason why the text expresses a heightened sense of fear and danger. For example, the priest's prayer on the practitioner's behalf enjo ins Christ to con­strain these angels to appear \"without harm to body or spirit:'84 The preparation for the conjuration also reveals this sense of danger, as extra rituals fo r protec­tion are required.85 As for the angels, they are asked to take not just a pleasing form but one that is not offensive, dangerous, or frightening.86 And while cor­rect performance of the ritual means that they will ultimately come and grant requests, they will first try to frighten the conjurer with various visions.87 The conjuration for the fo urth group, the terrestrial angels, further reinforces this element of danger.88 Although Honorius never explicitly states the reason for this danger, the apparent implication is that the spirits themselves (angels and demons alike) are the source of the danger. And, more explicitly than in the case of the planetary angels, both the aery and the terrestrial angels can be summoned for overtly harmful purposes.89 At one point, however, there is a rather distinctive change in the form of the conjuration. In the ritual for summoning the aery angels, an additional step re­quires that the practitioner rouse certain demons who are associated with the seven planets and directions. This conjuration begins by calling out cycles of questions to them: \"Where is King Harthan and where are his attendants Bileth, Mylalu, and Abucaba? Where is King Abaa and where are his attendants Hyici, Quyron, Zach, and Eladeb? Where is King Mayman and where are his atten­dants Assaibi, Albunalich, Haibalidech, and Yasfla?\"90 As Gershom Scholem has noted, this form of indirect invocation may be found with some frequency in Islamic magical texts, but it is quite rare in Jewish sources.91 Nor is this formula common in Christian texts, where the wording of invocations closely resembles that ofJewish magic.92 The inclusion of this form, then, indicates a nearly certain case of borrowing from an Islamic source. In addition, the demon kings men­tioned bear a striking resemblance to the Islamic tradition of the seven demon kings, who are also associated with the planets and directions. Some onomastic similarities further support this particular influence.93 Another element reminiscent oflslamic tradition is the requirement to learn the angels' particular characteristics as a prerequisite to performing the ritual. 94 In general, the Islamic magical tradition is often highly theoretical in focus. Trea­tises of magic tend to explain how and why magic functions, and it is through this knowledge that one is able to operate the magical arts.95 Thus the knowledge of a spirit's properties is a crucial prerequisite for any invocation.96 In Jewish tradition, however, magic is primarily performative, accomplished through the power of words and actions.97 But while such a distinction is provocative, it is"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"124 INVOKING ANGELS certainly insufficient to draw stable conclusions about the specific influences on the rituals of the Sworn Book. After all, a learned magician, familiar with both church liturgy and Scholastic theology, could certainly incorporate elements of theory and ritual into a magical text. What is more conclusive, however, is the conception of the angels themselves. 4· Envisioning Spirits Christians in the later Middle Ages still understood angels mainly according to the sixth-century conceptions of Pseudo-Dionysius and Gregory the Great, in which angels remained abstract, uncountable, and largely anonymous.98 With the exception of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, the angels of the celestial hierarchy were perhaps too abstract to rival the saints as personal inter­cessors. In addition, the veneration of angels could easily arouse suspicions of latria. 99 This is not to suggest that medieval Christianity lacked a rich tradition of angelology-far from it, as David Keck has shown.100 Nevertheless, there is little precedent for the Sworn Book's ideas amid the various depictions of angels that flourished in monastic writings, Scholastic theology, biblical commentaries, sermons and exempla, eschatological writings, vernacular literature, and even visionary accounts, all of which tend to situate even the most exotic ideas about angels within accepted frameworks.101 The angels portrayed by Honorius, how­ever, not only differ strikingly from these traditional Christian conceptions but actually exemplify distinctive characteristics of Jewish and Islamic angelologies. As we have already seen, angels in the Sworn Book are separated into four different groups. The first consists of the celestial spirits that are associated with the traditional celestial hierarchy, albeit presented in an unusual order. The au­thor explains, \"Certain of them serve God alone, and these are the nine orders of angels: cherubim, seraphim, thrones, dominations, virtues, principalities, powers, archangels, and angels:'102 As presented, these angels correspond some­what to orthodox notions of angels. Although they exist in a constant state of praise fo r God and cannot be conjured or compelled in any way, their power can still be invoked in supplication to God or even when conjuring other types of angels.103 Since the portrayal of these angels in the London version of the Sworn Book is copied largely verbatim from the Ars notoria, it cannot provide much evidence for Honorius's adaptation ofJewish and Islamic sources. More reveal­ing, however, are the angels described in the other sections of the work. The second group of angels in the Sworn Book is composed of the celestial spirits of the planets. Each planet has a corresponding group of named angels, whose various character traits are specified. These include the angels' function,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 125 region, body, color, and shape.104 The functions indicate, for example, that the spirits of the moon change desires and thoughts, speed up journeys, and cause rain, while the regional attribute associates them with one of seven geographical divisions.105 The other characteristics all relate to physical appearance, as when the spirits of Jupiter are described as being \"of medium height;'106 and those of Mars are colored \"red, like burning coat:'107 Each group of angels has three to five demons beneath it. Of these demons, one is the king and the rest are atten­dants.108 These demons rule over the rest of the planets' demons.109 In general, the planetary angels \"esteem men\" and should be considered good.110 However, their descriptions call these assertions into question. The angels of Mars, it is said, \"provoke wars, killing, destruction, and the death of men and animals,\"lll while those of Saturn are even said to cause sadness, anger, and hatred.112 The angels in the third group are known as aery spirits. This is a dangerous assertion, as the Christian tradition had long considered spirits of the air de­mons.l13 The author explains, \"There are spirits in the air whom the holy mother Church calls damned, but these spirits claim that the opposite is true; thus we prefer to call them neither good nor evil:'114 That said, he proceeds to explain that there are actually several types of aery spirits. Those associated with the east and west are benevolent, for \"their activities aid in good, and scarcely harm anyone:'115 The spirits of the north and south, however, are evil, and their works are harmful.116 Finally, there is a third group, corresponding to three of the ordi­nal directions, which truly are \"neither good nor evil;' since these spirits simply obey whatever invocations are addressed to them. Like the planetary angels, these angels of the seven directions117 preside over demonic hierarchies, but they differ in that they also rule over spirits of the winds. They are likewise described in terms of function, region, body, color, and shape. In this case, however, new characteristics are included, such as their faces, manner of movement, and signs. The signs are indications that the angel is present, as when the conjurer sees men being eaten by lions in order to signify the presence of a southeastern spirit.118 Only a few details are provided about the last group, the terrestrial angels. The author explains that they are \"filthy and full of all depravity.\"119 Their func­tions include such activities as killing trees and crops, causing earthquakes, de­stroying the foundation of cities, and ruining men.120 These angels are large and frightening, with claws, five faces, and diverse animal body parts.121 They too are arranged in a hierarchy, with one king and four attendants, each of whom commands legions that in turn rule over groups of more than four thousand demons.122 The particular sign indicating their arrival is that \"the entire world appears destroyed:'123 In fact, these creatures are said to be so frightening that Honorius recommends leaving a written request in order to avoid seeing or hear­ing themP24"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"126 INVOKING ANGELS Such conceptions of angels are not the product of Honorius's imagination, nor can they all be attributed to the influence of other Christian texts of angel magic, such as the Ars natoria or the Holy Almandal. 125 Rather, they have strong roots in Jewish tradition. During the intertestamental period, Judaism began to develop a highly personalized conception of angels that differed significantly from the Hebrew Bible's portrayal of nondescript emissaries.U6 This new con­ception grants individual angels a unique and powerful name, a personality, a detailed physical appearance, and specific fu nctions in the world. These angels tend to be arranged in numbered groups and placed within complex hierarchical systems. Although they are hierarchically superior to men, angels are thought to have significant contact with the human world, sometimes in the role of teachers. They also display an affinity with humanity in their ability to perform both good and evil works. While this new notion of angels was by no means universally accepted, 127 it is the dominant conception of angels in those texts of Jewish magic and mysticism that influenced Christian angel magic. One of the earliest and most influential examples of this angelology is 1 Enoch, composed sometime between the second century BCE and the first century CE.128 This pseudepigraphal apocalypse includes the account of a group of angels who decide to take human wives. They teach men the secrets of transmutation, incan­tations, astrology, and various other illicit practices, and the children born to their human wives become demons (1 En. 6-8, 15). The leaders of these fallen angels are listed by name, as are the archangels and various others that appear through­out the story.129 Knowledge of these names can in some cases give someone power over these angels (69:14).130 Each angel also has its place in a complex hierarchy of leaders and subordinates. Though a full description of this hierarchy is absent from the text, the number of angels that compose various groups is often speci­fied. For example, the fallen angels number two hundred, twenty-one of whom are leaders (6:6, 69:2). Elsewhere, hierarchies are arranged in groups of three, fo ur, twelve, 360, and one thousand (82:11-20). Even when a multitude of angels is considered infinite, numerical language is used, as when the text speaks of \"a hundred thousand and ten million times a hundred thousand angels\" (71:13)_!31 The individualized nature of the angels in Judaism meant that there was often a fine line between angel and man: the Essenes at Qumran viewed their com­munity as a direct parallel to their idea of angelic priesthood;132 several texts of antiquity and late antiquity attest to righteous humans as having initially been, or having become, angels;133 and themes of affinity and rivalry between humans and angels are common throughout rabbinic literature.134 There is even some evidence that Jewish \"cults of the angels\" may have existed.1351t was during these early centuries of the common era that a loosely related corpus ofJewish writings began to fo cus on Ezekiel's vision of the flying chariot.136 A major theme of this"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 12. 7 literature is the human's journey through the celestial palaces, ultimately arriv­ing at the throne of God. Writings connected to this tradition are commonly known as Hekhalot (\"palaces\") literature.137 These texts represent centuries of composition, redaction, and fluctuation138 and are far from uniform in their content.139 But if the diverse characterizations of angels cannot present a unified angelology, the literature is all the more relevant for the broad range of concep­tions it provides. The depiction of angels in terms of names, numbers, ranks, hierarchies, and functions is well represented in Hekhalot literature.140 There are, however, ad­ditional parallels to the angelology of the Sworn Book that are remarkable for their similarity in detail. To compare just one set of passages, known collectively as Hekhalot Rabbati, there are examples similar to the use of a seal containing God's name, 141 to the description of specific signs that indicate the presence of an angel,142 and to the portrayal of angels as frightening, angry, or even violent.143 There is also a strong emphasis throughout the literature on invocations and rituals for conjuring angels, in which these spirits are expected to reveal secrets, teach Torah, answer questions, provide revelations in dreams, and initiate mys­tical experiences.144 1t is notable that one of the predominant elements of these conjurations is a strong emphasis on the need to perform them in a state of rit­ual and ascetic purity.145 The emphasis on invoking angels is also elaborated in a series of textual frag­ments that have become known as the Sepher ha-Razim, or Book of the Mys ter­ies.146 This work, which shares some themes with mystical Hekhalot literature, tells of the hierarchies of named angels that fill the seven firmaments of heaven. The reader is instructed in the appropriate way to conjure these angels, compel­ling them to carry out a range of activities, including healing the sick, predicting the future, causing humans to fall in love, and helping people win at horse rac­ing. Some of them are even \"prepared to torment and torture a man to death:'147 The moral ambiguity-or perhaps neutrality-of these angels is further indi­cated in that some are, by their very nature, angels of anger, wrath, fury, or de­struction.148 One group is said to \"stand in terror, cloaked in wrath, girded with dread, surrounded by trembling:'149 And in some cases the text indicates that the same angels can be summoned for either good or evil.150 The rituals for conjura­tion often must be performed with respect to specific times, days, months, years, and astrological bodies.151 Certain rituals in the text are even aimed at convers­ing with the sun, the moon, and the stars, and there are indications that the vari­ous months, as well as the sun, are each ruled over by angels.152 Again, the theme of ritual and ascetic purity is central.153 The work of tracing the spread of magical manuscripts throughout the Mid­dle Ages is a monumental task, owing to the anonymous or pseudepigraphal"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"128 INVOKING ANGELS nature of most of the works, as well as to their particularly low survival rate.l>l Without more studies on magical codices and catalogues, such as those recently carried out by Frank Klaassen and Sophie Page, it remains nearly impossible to identify who was reading what particular text, in what place, and at what point in time. But if we cannot yet identity the exact points at which Christians may have come in contact with these ideas, it is nonetheless clear that such texts were in circulation during the Middle Ages. For example, much of the extant Hekhalot literature was preserved through the writings of the Haside Ashkenaz, an influential circle of Rhineland mystics who flourished during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.155 Given the growth of Kabbalah in the same period, it is clear that a diverse array of Jewish magical and esoteric sources had spread throughout most of western Europe by the time of the Sworn Book's composi­tion.156 The clear presence of these themes in works such as the Sworn Book in­dicates that Christians had a certain degree of access to such ideas. Further, the Liber Razielis, produced from Jewish sources at the court of Alfonso X around the third quarter of the thirteenth century, presents angels in ways consistent with the earlier Jewish magical texts discussed here. In fact, it even includes the Sepher ha-Razim.157 Perhaps more than any other points of contact, the Liber Ra­zielis surely played a large role in the Latin dissemination of Jewish angel magic. There is more knowledge of the particular Arabic magical texts that were translated and circulated in the late medieval Latin We st.158 These types of texts, often with Neoplatonic and astrological influences, were also important fo r the angelology of the Sworn Book.159 Indeed, they were fundamental in shaping the practice of astral magic and in defining the influential category of \"natural magic:'160 The most well known of such treatises is the Picatrix, which was trans­lated from Arabic into Spanish and then into Latin in the mid-thirteenth cen­tury.161 This book, intended as a thorough instruction manual in the magical arts, is largely representative of the genre, treating such topics as the houses of the zodiac, the construction of talismans, correspondences in nature, love spells, poisons, and the magical properties of herbs and gems.162 Of particular interest is the focus on planetary spirits.163 Each planet has several spirits, each with its own name, to which certain prayers are addressed.164 The knowledge of these spirits, their properties, and their relations is crucial, as science and philosophy are seen as fundamental to carrying out magical practices.165 Another text that circulated widely is the De radiis, attributed to al-Kindi.166 Like many of the works of magic that originated in Islamic environments, this text is fo cused largely on the philosophical underpinnings of the magical arts rather than on strictly practical instructions, in this case on the workings of magic through planetary influence and \"stellar rays:· The sixth chapter of this treatise is specifically devoted to prayers and invocations, many of which are"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 129 directed to spirits and the planets. The spirits, though incorporeal, are able to affect the world through cosmic harmonies and sympathies, which presupposes a network of correspondences throughout the cosmos. The text also emphasizes the power of invoking the names of God. Unlike the Picatrix, however, the De radiis leaves all spirits and angels anonymous.167 A final representative example from the Islamic tradition is the Liber anti­maquis, a text that also shows Hermetic influence and that is cited twice in the Picatrix.168 This text specifically assigns a name to the spirit of each planet. Each one is described in terms of its related animals, colors, minerals, or herbs, and according to factors such as appearance, temperature, and odor.169 The reader is instructed to recite lists of names, when the astrological conditions are appro­priate, in order to conjure these spirits. One such list contains seventy-two names, which were given to men so that \"whenever they wanted to do good or evil, a spirit would appear to them and carry out their wishes:'170 A fo cus on names is found elsewhere in Islamic magic, as in the writings of al-Buni, where divine names are particularly prominent in magical operations.171 As in the works of Avicenna, angels in Islamic magic were reimagined as planetary spirits.172 A sort of intellectual rigor and purity is necessary to com­municate with them, somewhat parallel to the requirement for ritual purity in Jewish texts. Through sympathies, correspondences, or harmonies, these incor­poreal beings can affect the world when invoked. While the power of names is not as prevalent as in Jewish tradition-indeed, many Islamic texts leave the spirits anonymous-it is not entirely absent.173 Its presence in some cases may in fact be a result of Jewish origin, as these two traditions undoubtedly influenced or, in Steven M. Wasserstrom's terminology, \"cross-fertilized\" each other.174 Nev­ertheless, this is the form in which the ideas circulated among the learned magi­cians of late medieval Latin Christendom, such as Honorius. The chart below is intended as a general comparison of widespread Christian conceptions about angels with those found in Jewish and Islamic magical litera­ture. It does not, of course, represent every variation to be found within these traditions. ;.

Indirect: \"Where is the demon N?\" cherubim and seraphim\" that conjured an unorthodox series of angels by name.177 We may never know the precise source of Aldebert's cosmology, but there are clear affinities with Jewish tradition. Of the angels mentioned, he refers to Uriel and Raguel, both of whom figure in 1 Enoch.178 This text, it is known, had reached Ireland by this time.179 While no direct evidence is available, Aide­bert may have-even if indirectly-come into contact with ideas from this or similar texts.180 Whatever the origin of these ideas, they caused great concern, for authorities suspected that Aldebert was actually summoning demons. In a response to Boniface, Pope Zacharias wrote: \"[he] declared that he knew the names of the angels, as you described in your letter; but we declare that they are names, not of angels but rather of demons:'181 Aldebert was officially condemned as a heretic and taken into custody. The following year, a Roman synod followed up on the matter. According to the acts of the synod, the bishops declared, \"The eight names of angels which Aldebert calls upon in his prayer are not names of angels, except Michael, but rather of demons whom he has summoned to his aid. We, instructed by Your Apostolic Holiness and by divine authority, know the names of but three angels: Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, whereas he brought in the names of demons under the guise of angels:'182 In the final decrees of the synod, Aldebert was convicted of \"summoning demons to his aid under the guise of angels:'183 Aide­bert's sentencing seems to have had little lasting effect, for his activities again drew attention two years later.184 But the synod's affirmation that Michael, Ga­briel, and Raphael were the only angels known by name persisted much longer. It was soon codified in Charlemagne's Admonitio generalis of 789185 and again in a capitulary of Ansegisus in 827.186 The sentiment carried on in the later Middle Ages, as did the accompanying suspicion of demons being summoned in the guise of angels. If the practice of necromantic magic is essentially identical to exorcism, as Kieckhefer has argued, then it is hardly surprising that a parallel version of spiritual discernment came to play a role in regard to magic as well. In general,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"132 INVOKING ANGELS \"discerning spirits\" referred to the process of determining whether someone was divinely or demonically possessed.187 With respect to medieval magic, the analogous question was whether the spirits invoked were angels or demons. Although the spirits conjured were usually designated angelic, demonic, or neu­tral within the medieval magical tradition, Christian theologians looking at such texts generally presumed invocations of any sort to be demonic, even if the spirits were called angelic and even if the outcomes were beneficent.188 As in Aldebert's case, anything ostensibly angelic was simply suspected of deceit. When a text such as the Sworn Book proposed angel magic as a legitimate practice, distinct from demonic necromancy, it challenged the deep-seated assumptions that underlay medieval conceptions of magic. Ultimately, both forms of spiritual discernment raised questions of authority. This connection is perhaps nowhere clearer than in the works of the theologian John Gerson, who served as chancellor of the University of Paris at the turn of the fifteenth century. By actively appropriating the authority to discern spirits in cases of revelatory possession, he effectively discredited female mystics who claimed that their experiences were divinely inspired.189 In similar fa shion, he also attempted to consolidate his authority of discernment regarding magical conjurations. But in this he was not alone, for much like Aldebert and Boniface, magicians and church authorities had long clashed over the discernment of sp irits. The Ars notoria, as noted above, was one of the earliest Christian texts of learned magic that made significant use of angels. This well-known treatise prob­ably began to circulate in the twelfth century,190 at just the time when Hebrew and Arabic translations were becoming available in Latin.l9! While it lacks the overt conjurations of the later Sworn Book, it is hard to deny that an implicit ele­ment of constraint underlies the assertions of guaranteed ritual efficacy in the text. Julien Veronese suggests that this particular problem may be the reason why the text explicitly presents the work as sacramental rather than magical.192 However, the \"syncretic\" nature of the angels, as well as their uncharacteristic prominence, kept the text firmly outside the realm of orthodoxy.193 The au­thorities agreed, and the Ars notoria was repeatedly condemned throughout the fo llowing centuries.194 Thomas Aquinas, who demonstrated fa miliarity with the text, condemned it for, among other things, suspicion of demonic conjura­tions.195 Even John of Morigny, who had long experimented with the Ars nota­ria, eventually decried it: \"It was twice revealed to me by all the angelic spirits that in this book's prayers in outlandish tongues there was an invocation of ma­lign spirits hidden so subtly and ingeniously that nobody in the world, however subtle he be, would be able to perceive it:'196 John's Liber florum, a text that claimed delivery at the hands of the Virgin Mary, freshly systematized the basic"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 133 principles of the Ars notoria.197 He was sensitive to the problem of discerning spirits,198 but it was not enough to remove the lists of nomina ignota and assert that his text was divine in both origin and effect; it too was determined to be heretical and sorcerous, and it was condemned at Paris in 1323.199 Being very familiar with the Ars notoria, the redactor of the London Sworn Book could scarcely have been ignorant of the grounds on which it had been condemned. His own text was at particular risk, given its dependence on lhe Ars notoria and its rather explicit instructions for conjuring spirits, but he con­tinued to insist boldly on the legitimacy of such magic. In the prologue to the Sworn Book, he declares that the devil has manipulated church authorities into condemning magical conjurations. Honorius defends the practice \"because it is not possible for a wicked and unclean man to work truly through this art, nor is man subjugated to any spirits; rather, these spirits are unwillingly compelled to answer to pure men and to carry out their wishes.\"200 Insisting on complete control over the spirits-just as in exorcism-was a standard way to defend nec­romantic practice. This may, however, be the first time this argument had been used to justify the subjugation of angels. From the beginning, Honorius asserts that pagans and Jews can receive no benefit from the magical practices described in the text. When pagans try to perform such magic, he claims, they are deceived by the very spirits they at­tempt to conjure, who merely perpetuate the pagans' bad faith in idolatry.201 As for the Jews, their refusal to accept baptism has deprived them of the ability to conjure angels effectively. 202 Only Christians can successfully invoke angels or obtain a vision of God. With respect to the latter, the author explicitly states that firm adherence to the doctrines of the Catholic faith is a requirement for attain­ing the vision.203 At the end of the work, he again explains that this book can be of no use to non-Christians.204 Throughout it all, he implicitly defends the or­thodoxy of this practice, incorporating masses and other aspects of traditional liturgy into the rituals, emphasizing moral and ritual purity, and even suggest­ing that the reader seek the assistance of a priest in carrying out certain parts of the rituals. 205 Given the extent of Jewish influence on the Sworn Book, some of which may have been directly borrowed, it is difficult to imagine that even the original au­thor was completely unaware of his Jewish sources. Kieckhefer has argued that the London version's repudiation of the Jews serves to distance Honorius's prac­tices from Jewish ones, which he was more or less consciously adopting. In doing so, he obviates any charges of Judaizing and thereby retains part of his claim to the orthodoxy of this magic.206 This thesis is supported all the more by the work of Veenstra, who has now shown that the redactor, responsible for adding or emphasizing many of the Jewish elements in the text, actually replaced"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"134 INVOKING ANGELS the original anti-Muslim polemics with anti-Jewish ones. 207 If Veenstra is cor­rect in pointing to geography as a crucial determinant of emphasis, then this shift would fu rther support the argument that the redaction took place outside Spain. One of the most crucial aspects of the Sworn Book's angel magic lies in the sharp distinctions that Honorius draws. First, he argues that the celestial angels of the nine orders cannot be conjured or commanded.208 In short, the prayers that invoke them, derived from the Ars notoria, do not constitute any form of constraint. This key element is what separates the first part of the ritual-and, by implication, the entire Ars notoria-from the explicit conjurations that follow. Second, within these conjurations, he distinguishes and describes the various types of spirits involved: celestial planetary angels, aery angels, neutral aery spirits, demonic aery spirits, spirits of the winds, terrestrial angels, and demons. Having differentiated all the spirits, he can more clearly assert that the instruc­tions in the text refer to the conjuring of angels. Thus, even in his discussion of the frightful and dangerous terrestrial angels, whose adjuration is strongly dis­couraged, Honorius still claims that these are angels, and he is careful to distin­guish them from demons.2091t is noteworthy, however, that in spite of the par­ticular emphasis on angels, the Sworn Book is also a work of explicit demonic magic.210 The belief that angels can be subjected and controlled clearly applies as well to demons, the conjuring of which is mentioned in the prologueln and as part of the conjuration fo r the aery angels.212 Although the ritual detail in the Sworn Book suggests that it was a manual fo r practical use, these necromantic elements also underscore Honorius's claims for the legitimacy of invocative magic, whether angelic or demonic. But while he insists that most types of spirits can be subjugated by the pious magician, he nevertheless maintains the under­lying assumption throughout the work that there is a rather clear difference be­tween the conjuration of angels and demons. It would appear that Honorius's proposed discernment was lost on zealous inquisitors and theologians. As early as 1347 the text was mentioned in a sorcery trial against the monk Etienne Pepin (also called Oliver Aquitard). Accused. among other things, of conjuring demons, Pepin affirmed that his magical prac­tices involved the use of angel names. When asked specifically about a spirit mentioned in the Sworn Book, he also responded that it was an angel, not a demon.213 The book also figures among the works of necromancy that Nicholas Eymeric condemns in his Directorium inquisitorum of 1376.214 But the most explicit condemnation came at the end of the century. In 1398 the theological faculty of Paris, led by John Gerson, issued a condemnation of twenty-eight propositions related to magic, some of them clearly directed at practices fo und in the Sworn Book. Zis Among the errors listed are the beliefs that a vision of God"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 135 can be obtained through magic,216 that neutral spirits exist,217 that demon kings are associated with the directions,218 and that the church's condemnations of magic are irrational.219 In addition, the articles condemn the beliefs that ritual purity justifies sorcery220 and that items such as hoopoe blood and virgin parch­ment have efficacy over demons.221 With the exception of the specific references to hoopoe blood and to the church's condemnation of magic, all of these \"errors\" are probably the result of Jewish and Islamic practices that had been appropri­ated into Christian magic. Further, these condemnations reinforce the orthodox position against necromancy, asserting that God does not force demons to obey their conjurers,222 that demons are not otherwise compelled to obey,223 that sum­moning demons is inherently idolatrous,224 and that it is the source-not the effect-that determines whether certain practices are licit.225 Finally, the condemnations answer the challenge posed by angel magic. They insist that acts of sorcery are not revealed to men by good angels,Z26 nor do good angels perform activities related to magic, 227 and, most significantly, that the only sources of such power are God, nature, or demons.2281hus Honorius's claims are fa lse: he may call the spirits angels but they are actually demons in disguise. While this position is certainly not new to this particular condemnation, the faculty's need to reiterate it reflects the increasing challenge that angel magic represented in this period. Just as Gerson worked to appropriate the authority of spiritual discernment in regard to fe male mystics-his first treatise on the sub­ject, De distinctione verarum visionum a fa/sis, was written only three years after the Paris condemnation-so too did he strengthen his authority to declare all invocative magic demonic. Epilogue: The \"Christianization\" of Angel Magic And yet, the redefinition of magic proposed by the Sworn Book and other such treatises was not utterly futile. As works of angel magic continued to pass through the hands of theologians and inquisitors, it became more difficult to maintain a firm stance against all forms of conjuration. One need only mention such fig­ures as Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), Henry Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535), and John Dee (1527-1608),229 whose diverse forms of spirit magic-however much (or little) altered by Neoplatonism and Hermeticism-would flourish throughout the following centuries.23° But before these figures, we find Antonio da Montolmo, who was a doctor and astrologer in Italy at the end of the fourteenth century. The importance of Montolmo and his writings has been emphasized by Nicolas Weill-Parot in several studies, which now include the edition of De occultis et manifestis that appears in this volume.231"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"136 INVOKING ANGELS In this work, Montolmo discusses the influences and magical operations relat­ing to the hierarchy of angelic \"Intelligences;' which consist of both good and evil spirits. Throughout, as Weill-Parot notes, Montolmo attempts to maintain an acceptable theological position by avoiding explicit conjurations of the high­est Intelligences (tantamount to theurgy in Augustine's sense), while remaining ambiguous as to the status of the lower ·�titudes:'232 By this point, however, the tradition of magic had begun to change. Montol­mo's portrayal of the Intelligences may have complicated received notions of magic by blurring the line between the role of impersonal astrological virtues and his ambiguously defined spirits, but the element of invocation is nonetheless present. That Montolmo openly acknowledged authorship of his works without suffering condemnation suggests that, at least in some learned circles, the invo­cation of good (or neutral) spirits was no longer met with instant skepticism that the spirits were really demons. 233 This is all the more surprising given the ambiva­lence of Montolmo's position, which is perhaps best highlighted by a version of the same text that speaks explicitly of demons rather than Intelligences.234 But the magicians, we might say, had won a partial victory. As traditions of Jewish and Islamic angel magic became entrenched in an ever growing body of Latin treatises, the idea of angel magic seems to have become distinct from demonic necromancy, no matter how thin the line between the two might have been. As the narrative goes, I suggest, Christians of the early Middle Ages adopted the practice of angel magic through contact with Jewish and Islamic ideas. The lack of a textual tradition, however, kept the practice from developing within Christianity. But the increased accessibility ofJewish and Islamic texts after the twelfth century brought Christians into contact with new conceptions of angels. While such ideas may not have been so easily incorporated into orthodox theol­ogy, Christian magicians were willing to adopt the new practices. Whatever they may have thought of Jewish and Islamic doctrine, they nevertheless believed that Jews and Muslims possessed efficacious occult knowledge. And it was cer­tainly easier to attempt to defend a work of angel magic, even by assimilation to natural magic, than one of overt demonic necromancy. The role of angel magic in the later Middle Ages is thus central to the trend that Claire Fanger has termed the \"radical positivization of magic:'235 As the growing popularity of these texts created a native tradition of angel magic within Christianity, both in Latin and in the vernacular, so too did it eventually change wider perceptions of the prac­tice. By the fifteenth century angel magic was in many respects tolerated. Only the explicitly demonic forms of magic were still actively condemned. 236 Thus Jewish and Islamic angelologies, having entered Christianity through magical texts-a path of less resistance-had begun to change wider Christian conceptions of both angels and magic."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"NOTES THE LIBER IURATUS HONORII 137 1.

This is not to say, however, that angels were infinite; they were just not counted or numbered. See, for example, Anselm of Canterbury, Cur Deu.s homo, book 1, §§16-18.

Honorius thus does not clearly fo llow the hierarchies of Gregory the Great or Pseudo-Dionysius ... 103. Liber iuratus, §CXXXIII (Hedegard, 140). 104. Cf. Kieckhefer, Forbidden Rites, 160-61. 105.

See Eph. 2:2. For the early history of this idea, see Richard P. H. Greenfield, Traditions of Belief ill Late Byzantine Demonology (Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1988), 15-18. More important for the Latin West, however, this idea is developed throughout the works of Augustine. See, for example, Con­fess ions 10.42; City of God 8.14-15, 8.22, 9.18, 10.21, 21.10; De divinatione daemonum, esp. chapter 3· 114. \"In quo [aere] sunt spiritus, quos sancta mater ecclesia dampnatos appellat, set ipsi opposi­tum asserunt esse verum,et ideo eos neque bonos neque malos volumus appellare:' Liber iuratus, �II (Hedegard, 125). The idea of neutral spirits was not common, though it existed in the Latin West. Marcel Dando has convincingly traced literary instances directly back to the Navigatio Bren­dmli, in \"Les anges neutres:· Cahiers d'Etudes Cathares, 2d ser., 69 (Spring 1976): 3-28. Although Dando notes some possible precedents in the church fathers, it seems equally plausible that the ideas in the �igatio are associated with the apocryphal Jewish texts that were available in Ireland at the time of its composition.

The power of angelic names is emphasized in several late antique magical texts. See, e.g., The Testament of Solomon: Edited from Manuscripts at Mount Athos, Bologna, Holkham Hall, Jerusalem, London, Milan, Paris, and Vienna, ed. Chester Charlton McCown (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1922). The best English translation is Dennis C. Duling's \"Testament of Solomon: A New Translation and Introduc­tion:' in Charlesworth, Old Tes tament Pseudepigrapha, 1:935-87. While the existing manuscripts have been viewed as recensions of a rather unified treatise, recent scholarship has emphasized the under­lying variety of textual traditions. See Sarah L. Schwarz, \"Building a Book of Spells: The So-Called 1estament of Solomon Reconsidered\" (PhD diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2005). 131. Cf. Dan. 7:10.

Pamela Selwyn, cd. Bernhard Jussen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), 15-54, have argued that, in relation to the New Testament, numbers were meant to emphasize the inap­propriateness of counting (16-17). I do not find this interpretation compelling in relation to magical texts, where numbers are often quite significant 132.

Veenstra The origins of the Sworn Book of Honorius, until now known only through a small group of British Library manuscripts, are hidden behind the veils of his­tory. The material evidence hitherto available seems to limit its medieval recep­tion to the London area; internal evidence might suggest that part of the material contained in the book originated in southern France. Its unbalanced composi­tion has led scholars to believe that it is a compilation of two texts, the one a thirteenth-century manual of demonic magic, the other a fo urteenth-century theurgical treatise inspired by Jewish mysticism. Reliable references to the work date from the mid-fourteenth century and later, with the exception of William of Auvergne's reference to a Liber sacratus from around 1240, which is currently gen­erally believed to apply to a \"consecrated\" text other than the one by Honorius.1 A mystifying text of uncertain pedigree is a strong incentive for scholarly speculation (and given the secondary literature so far, well-founded specula­tion), but to put the existing hypotheses to the test, further source evidence is required. In the case of Honorius, Carlos Gilly's discovery of the Summa sacre magice, a colossal fo urteenth-century compendium of magic written by the Catalan or Valencian scholar Berengaria Ganell, brings to light hitherto unno­ticed materials that shed new light on (and further complicate) the tradition of the Honorius ritual. 2 In his Summa, Ganell incorporated substantial parts of the 1.iber iuratus as it is known from the London manuscripts. The references to his source, however, are not always explicit, and even when Ganellliterally copies several pages, the origin of the material can only be gleaned through a simple 1his essay was researched and written during my stay as a fe llow at the Herzog August Bibliothek in 'A'Oifenbiittel. I wish to thank Katelyn Mesler and Claire Fanger for reading and commenting on the la.t. and Claire for her valuable suggestions in structuring the argument and for adding explanatory ::mslat.ions fo r some of the Latin lines."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"152 INVOKING ANGELS dicit Ho norius. This briefest of references, however, also surfaces in sections that cannot be found in the London Honorius, suggesting that what Ganell copied from the version of the Liber iuratus at his disposal may have exceeded what is preserved in the Sloane copies at present. In this essay, I demonstrate that the copy of the Sworn Book from which Ganell copied substantial parts is older than the London manuscripts, and that Ganell's Honorius sections and the London Honorius have a common ancestor. This makes Ganell an important source in the composition and transmission history of the Sworn Book, since he provides copies of the texts that eventuall}· went to make up what I would like to call the London version, as well as other materials that have been omitted from it. This essay also significantly reconfigures evidence for the text's dating. While it is still not possible to establish a precise date of composition for the Sworn Book, the passages from the Ars notoria B text in the London Honorius that conclusively rule out an early thirteenth-century date for the London version do not appear in Ganell's text. Thus, while a date of origin in the late·thirteenth or early fourteenth century seems plausible for other reasons, there is no longer anything conclusively to rule out the possible existence of the Sworn Book as early as the time of William of Auvergne. Ganell's Summa is extant in two manuscripts.3 One is a unique Latin codex that was owned by John Dee, who added marginal notes and book and chapter divi­sions and even a date of composition: 1346.4 Gilly suggests that Dee may have sold or presented the manuscript to Landgrave Wilhelm or to the learned Moritz of Hessen during a visit to Kassel in 1586 or 1589.5 The second copy of the text is a complete translation of the book in German, a codex of more than eight hun­dred folios, composed probably not long after the book arrived in Germany. The work contains five books, each book c omprising two or three tracts, and each tract containing a number of chapters ranging from three to thirteen (making a total of eighty-five). The contents of these chapters constitute a comprehensive encyclopaedia of magical materials that were circulating in Spain and, possibly, southern France in the thirteenth century. There are chapters on the rings of Solomon (II.I.I, II.2.10 ), on the Schemhamphoras (I.1.1o, 11.2.5, 11.2.7, 11.3.3, IV.2.1, IV.2.2), on the Almandal (I11.2.1), on Thos Grecus (V.1.5) and Rasiel (V.2.13); there-is a chapter De candariis Salomonis (ll.2.12) and a Liber trium animarum (IV.2.3); and, of great importance for the subject at hand, a Capitulum de sacra­tione Honorii (IV.1.5) and a Capitulum de sigillo Dei (IV.1.6), both of which con­tain the core (and, in part, the verbatim) text of the first part of the London Honorius.6 Other Honorius sections can be found in the Capitulum de vocatione sanctorum angelorum in circulo (III.1.2) and in the Capitulum de novem modis"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 153 invocationis spirituum (III.1.3), which contains sections on the planetary and aerial spirits.7 Analyzing the Summa, however, one should bear in mind that even though he may have copied or quoted substantial parts from the books he consulted, Ganell dearly strove to compile a unitary volume, writing connecting sentences and paragraphs and adding internal references to create greater cohesion. Com­pilation, synthesis, and occasional paraphrase characterize his method, though only careful analysis of those chapters of which the materials have a demon­strable tradition can bring to light the exact nature of his modus operandi. 8 Such an analysis of the Summa, however, would be a considerable task and far beyond the scope of this contribution. In what follows, I focus on Ganell's presentation of the Honorius material and especially on the sigillum Dei (SSM IV.1.5 and IV.t.6), taking for granted that his presentation offers plausible, though not al­ways decisive, evidence regarding his source. The Consecration Ritual According to Ganell Ganell makes occasional reference to the Sworn Book outside the chapters that he dedicates to the Honorius ritual. From these references it is evident that he had a copy of the Liber iuratus at his disposal,9 though it remains difficult to determine exactly what the contents of that book were. In his chapters he pro­vides substantial quotations, and certainly the text of the second and third part of the Sloane books can be found almost verbatim in the Summa, but it is pos­sible that he left out segments that were irrelevant to him. The chapters have another remarkable feature: the execution of the rituals relies on other magical source texts that Ganell mentions by name. One is the Schemhamphoras (about which I will have more to say later on), and another is the Liber trium animarum, which is a magical prayer book that constitutes one of the chapters in the Summa. 10 The book presents fifty-one prayers that-so it claims-constitute the founda­tion of the art of magic, since without these prayers no magical operation can be successful. A general comparison of the Summa chapters and the London Liber iuratus yields the following results. The London Honorius presents an unbalanced five­part composition of which the first is by far the largest, containing prescriptions fo r making the sigillum Dei, guidelines for the ritual, and the prayers that ac­company it. Two Honorius chapters in the fourth book of Ganell's Summa deal with this first part of the London version. 1hc prescriptions for producing the sigillum constitute a separate chapter, and there is a verbatim correspondence several pages long, but the prayers that the Honorius in Ganell refers to are not"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"154 INVOKING ANGELS the ones in the London version. The second, third, and fourth parts of the Lon­don Honorius deal with elaborate interdependent rituals for the conjuration of planetary, aerial, and terrestrial spirits. These three parts have in common the construction of a magical circle, a shared set of magical prescriptions, and sets of voces magicae and ritual fo rmulas that tie the sections conveniently to­gether. Parts two and three can be found (almost) verbatim in the Summa, and, like the sections in the Sloane books, these texts also display the same degree of interdependence.11 However, in copying the Honorius material of parts two and three, GaneD does not explicitly state his source. Unlike the two chapters in book four of the Summa (where the chapter title is a reliable indicator), the Honorius sections in book three can only be identified by means of a brief reference (dicit Ho norius). and this reference is not confined to the two parts that can be clearly identified as parts of the London text. Chapter III.I.J is a vast text of more than sixty densely written pages (of which the concluding section is lost because one of the quires went missing) detailing no fewer than nine operations fo r invoking an­gels and spirits. These operations show a similar interdependence as regards the use of specific ritual fo rmulas, prayers, voces magicae, and magic circles, and the name Honorius surfaces once in a while as well.Jl The fifth of these operations can be identified with certainty as the third part of the London Honorius, but it is by no means certain that this is the only part that Ganell copied from the Honorius book that he was using. The rather abstruse claim of the London Hon­orius that he intended to compile a large comprehensive volume may in fact contain a grain of truth.13 Parts fo ur and five of the Sloane manuscripts show clear signs of a lack of editorial acumen and perseverance, and the \"original\" Honorius from which he was working and which was also used by Ganell may have been bigger. The Honorius material in Ganell's Summa provides several new insights and solutions to problems posed by the Sloane texts. Since the two chapters in book fo ur dealing with the sigillum Dei are the most interesting as well as the most rewarding, I take these as my point of departure and main fo cus, returning to the sections on planetary and aerial spirits at the end of this chapter. Ganell, in a way, disrupted the order of the Liber iuratus by incorporating these later parts on the planetary and aerial spirits (which make clear reference to the sigillum Dei and the function of a helpful priest in executing the rituals) in an earlier part of his Summa. The aim of the Honorius ritual in the two Summa chapters of book four is the consecration of the sigillum Dei, which allows the operator to conjure angels and demons for various ends and purposes. One of the aims is dearly to see God while the operator is still in the flesh, as is made explicit in one of the prayers,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 155 but the visio Dei is not exclusively in the fo reground, as the ritual is essentially geared to ritual purification. At the end of the sigillum Dei chapter there is a list of six \"works of God\" that can be performed after the consecration; the first of these is the opus visionis divine. The visio Dei is an important topic in thirteenth­century Scholastic philosophy (as the ultimate end of life) but gains a this-1111-orldly nuance in Lullian mysticism or in Dante's Paradiso, when the suggestion is raised that God may be seen in this life. Honorius clearly shares in the mysti­cal turn, but the text as presented in the Summa in no way counters the outrage of Pope John XXII. The origin myth of the council of magicians is absent, and this seems to warrant the conclusion that Ganell's Honorius material predates not only the London Honorius but also the pontificate of John XXII. There is another notable characteristic of the two Honorius chapters: there seems to be no specific emphasis on the inefficacy of the ritual as performed by Jewish magicians, and also the references to the heavenly palaces (clear evidence of the influence of the Enoch literature) are curiously absent-curiously, be­owse the paragraphs in which they occur have verbatim parallels in the SSM. This means that they were omitted (why?) by Ganell's Honorius, or added later ! as is testified by the London sources). It is not likely they were left out by Gan­dl, since he knew his Jewish sources (as well as Hebrew) and makes references 1o Metatron elsewhere in his book. It may be that the older Honorius, who does 1tt111 to be influenced by Jewish mysticism, simply confined himself to Chris­tim visionary perceptions and did not fe el compelled to integrate elements from the Hekhalot tradition.14 An explicit reference to Islam compensates for the absence of opposition to the use of the ritual by Jews. One of the functions of the consecrated sigillum is 1o counter and destroy the secta or fides Machometi.15 This suggests that the Hooorius material incorporated in Ganell's book may have originated in a re­mnquista context where enemy perceptions were very much determined by Mus­im threats and not blurred by Lullian idealism and broad-mindedness. Lacking taeh an enemy perception, the London- centered northern European Honorius mlactor omitted the reference to Islam and made a point of Jewish magic. The ritual, which takes up fo rty days, is as fo llows. For the consecration of the !lip of God, one should take the blood of a mole, a dove, a bat, or a hoopoe16 and .::oosecrate it with the fifteenth prayer from the Liber trium animarum (LTA) and tiJIIle names from the Schemhamphoras. The sigil is then drawn with the blood aa parchment and fu migated17 while three other prayers ( 6, 12, and 10) from the li-\\ are recited. For a period of twenty days the operator should attend Mass, re­Oiing prayer 16 on his way to church and prayers 22, 14, 23, 21, 32, 33, 34, 29, and JO when he is inside. This procedure can also be fo und in the text of the London Eiooorius, with almost exactly the same prayer numbers.18 The only difference is"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"156 INVOKING ANGELS that the prayers in the Liber trium animarum, which John Dee numbered care­fully as he went through the ritual, in no way correspond to the rather desultory prayer book section that constitutes the greater part of the first tractate of the Liber iuratus. Apparently the prayers were dispensable, even though the prayer numbers were not. Did Ganell dispense with the prayers that we still have in the London Honorius text, or was the London Honorius unfamiliar with the prayers ofthe LTA? The next step is to find a pious and reliable priest who will sing matins and celebrate Mass together with the operator. All through the communion service. prayers 13, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 should be recited, and afterward prayers 26 (by the priest), 19, and 20 (by the operator). Again, the numbers in both Honorius texts, but not the texts of the prayers, are the same. It may be worthwhile briefly to compare this passage in both texts, given the almost verbatim correspon­dence.

On the whole (meaning in the overall text), the translator seems to be fairly accurate, and even his mistakes testify to his intention to stay close to the original text. The thing to note in this comparison, however, concerns the underlined sentence in the text of the London Honorius, since it raises important questions regarding the relation between the two Hon­orius texts: did Ganell's Honorius omit or did the London Honorius add? A full comparison of both texts yields several of these discrepancies, which, in the instance just quoted, seems to be an interpolation on the part of the London Honorius. The additions, on the whole, seem to be asides, interjections, expla­nations, or elaborations that distract the reader's attention for a moment from the actual procedure of the ritual. The text continues with an injunction that the operator remain pure, both in body and in soul, and urges him to observe a twelve-day fast. The thirteenth day should be a Thursday, and on receiving the body of Christ the operator should recite the prayer Tu, Domine Ihesu Christe. The prayer is significant because of the ref erence to \"Dominum meum et creatorem meum, quem in carne mea vi­surus sum ego ipse et non alius\" (my Lord and my Creator whom I myself, none other, am about to see in my flesh)-the first unambiguous reference in the Honorius text in the Summa to the exclusive privilege of seeing God in this life. In the London texts, this vision is connected with videre celeste palacium, but this short though telling phrase is absent from the text in the Summa.19 After receiving the body of Christ, the operator should go home and on that same Thursday recite prayers 25, 28, and 31 together with the prayer Et tu, Do­mine, per annunciacionem. (In this prayer there is a reference to the sigillum that is not in the London Honorius: I discuss the text below.) He should then with­draw into seclusion and recite the remaining prayers in the LTA and a whole list of divine names. These names are from the list of the \"wo Dei vivi nomina:' which can be fo und in the London Honorius, neatly listed in a separate para­graph, but not in the Summa. Names and prayers alternate: enumeration of the first twenty-seven names (the names are in both Honorius versions, though with a few graphic variants) is followed by the prayer Deus meus, Pater omnipotens, which again is followed by names 28-48 (in both texts) and the prayer Respice humiliter preces humilis servi. 20 Honorius resumes the list with Pheton and Lethellere (nos. 49 and 50 in the LIH: Photon and Lethellete) in a prayer that begins Pheton celi et terre conditor­a prayer that is repeated in LIH, part 2. Ye t where the London text of this prayer lists the names of Ysmas (no. 51) up to and including Pantheon (no. 73), the Honorius in the Summa breaks off (thereby \"leaving out\" twenty-three names) and replaces the bulk of the prayer by the words et cetera, followed by the explicit"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 INVOKING ANGELS of the prayer mei corpusculi macule deleantur (let the stains of my body be re­moved). The phrase et cetera, of course, suggests that the careful reader will have encountered the full text of the prayer in an earlier section of the Summa (which is correct: the prayer, which is called the Oratio Salomonis, can be found some seventy pages earlier, at the end of chapter 111.1.2).21 Both texts are more or less on the same track again when they detail what should be done on the following six days (Friday-Wednesday).22 The operator should make a bed of straw on a field of ashes with the names of God written around it. According to the London Honorius, that should be a list of one hundred names (which he then enumer­ates), but for Ganell's Honorius it should be the seventy-two letters of the inef­fa ble name, the same sequence that surrounds the sigillum Dei. At this point, Ganell's Honorius does a little arithmetic. The thirteenth day (a Thursday) is preceded by a twelve-day fast, which in turn is preceded by a pe­riod of twenty days of ritual purification (also including a thirteen -day fast). On that Thursday, the ritual will have taken thirty-three days, to which are added the prescriptions for the following six days and the completion of the conse­cration on the following Thursday, which is then day 40. The number forty has several scriptural parallels to emphasize its significance, but in the present con­text the forty-day period between Christ's resurrection and ascension seems the most appropriate. The complete Honorius ritual as detailed in the London man­uscripts is more laborious and takes seventy-two days.23 It is difficult to make a comparable sum for the other Honorius sections in Ganell since it is not dear how many he incorporated. After the fa st, the operator is instructed to eat and to wash himself with dear, cold water. After the prayer Domine, sancte Pater, he should dress in a hair shirt and black garment and recite the Psalter and the Litany in the church choir. Again follows a prayer (Deus rex fo rtis et potens) and a list of divine names beginning with Zabuather (no. 74 from the list in the London Honorius) and ending with Rabur (no. 100). There are two points of difference between the Honorius texts of this final lengthy prayer. Twice Ganell's Honorius gives the line \"hoc sacratis­simum nomen et sigillum tuum benedicere et consecrare digneris;'24 which is absent from the London text, and when the prayer ends with the seventy-two­letter name, Ganell's Honorius refers to it as semenphoras, whereas the London Honorius does not. Leaving aside for a moment the section on the construction of thesigillum (which in Ganell is a separate chapter and which in the edition of the LIH has been labeled §IV), we can conclude that the core of this consecra­tion ritual is established by what in the printed edition is labeled §§LII, XCVIII, XCIX, C, and CI. Read consecutively in the LIH, these paragraphs present a ritual of purification aimed at the visio Dei and revolving around a set of one hundred divine names. By comparison, the text in the Summa deliberately links"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 159 the ritual to the sigillum and the Schemhamphoras (both references are absent from the LIH paragraphs) and seems to be very careless in copying the set of one hundred names; the list itself is not present. When Ganell copies the prescription for the seventy-two-letter name that has to be written around the bed of straw, he adds a line that looks like a per­sonal addition: \"quod dicetur in proposito centesimum N., cum sit centesinium de illis quibus in hoc capitulo utimur, vel Honorius in sua arte nova\" (which will be called the hundredth Name in the scheme, since it is the hundredth of those that we use in this chapter, or Honorius in his \"new art\").25 One gets the im­pression that Ganell is working from a Liber iuratus that he labels ars nova and in which there is, in fa ct, a list of one hundred names. Was he looking at a text identical to the Sloane manuscripts? And if so, why did he not copy the list of one hundred names? While the absence of the hundred names may be an oversight, the fact that Ganell refers to Honorius's book as an ars nova has to do with its close relation to the prayers in the Liber trium animarum, a liturgy not found in the Sloane books. The (hypothetical) Honorius text that Ganell uses presents a purification ritual that liturgically relies on a book called the Liber trium animarum and that incorporates a set of one hundred divine names. (To the compiler of the London Honorius, the Liber trium animarum was unknown, so he copied the prayer numbers but was compelled to come up with a new liturgy that he derived mainly from the Ars notoria.)26 Part ofGanell's hypothetical source is a descrip­tion of the sigillum Dei, which mainly relies on a Schemhamphoras of seventy­two letters. This seventy-two-letter name is present in the prayers of the ritual, and several references to the sigillum make this hypothetical source more a rit­ual of consecration of the sigil than a ritual for obtaining the divine vision. The final sections of the two Honorius texts are fundamentally different and have only one fe ature in common, namely, that the operator must go to sleep in order for the consecration to have its effect. 27 To the operator in the London Honorius, the divine vision is imparted and he beholds the celeste palacium. The author strongly contradicts the claim that mortal man, while still in the flesh, cannot behold God, arguing that many �ave been in spiritual rapture and have bad heavenly secrets revealed to them, rapt in spirit and dying a quasi-death of the body, which remains in a suspended state, \"refreshed by angelic food:'28 This polemical reaction to the idea that a divine vision was not to be had during mortal life (which is absent from Ganell's Honorius) was no doubt triggered by John XXII's skepticism. The author continues to stress the need for purity on the part of the operator. 29 Ganell's Honorius explains how during sleep the power of God ( virtus Dei) descends on the operator and the sigillum, completing the process of consecration"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160 INVOKING ANGELS Fig. 1 Ta bula Semarnphoras from Kassel, Universitatsbibliothek Kassel/ Landesbibliothek. und Murhardsche Bibliothek der Stadt Kassel, 4° astron. 3, L.2.f.15 and enabling both to be efficacious in the invocations that follow. On day 41, the magus is ordered to return to the circle (which may be in a wood or on a tower­there were many such consecrated circles in the time of Honor ius, Ganell adds), where he may invoke angels who descend within the circumference and even dwell there for a while. A similar procedure may be executed in a room in the house. (These are references to rituals described in book three of the Summa.) The operator is instructed to place the sigillum on a heptagonal table covered with a cloth of pure linen. Earlier prayers from the consecration may be used again, albeit with slight alterations, and at one point the operator is instructed to lie prostrate on the floor with the sigillum placed on his forehead. The angels, wlio are thus invited to appear, are there as proof and testimony of the sanctity of the sigil. Likewise, other magical tables or sigilla may be consecrated, such as the Ta bula Semamphoras (see fig. 1).30 It is likely, though by no means certain, that this final passage was present in Ganell's copy of the Liber iuratus. Whether or not it is interpolated, it does create a direct and convenient link between the consecration chapter and the chapter on the construction of the sigillum Dei in the Summa."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Constructing the Sigil HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 161 Casting a superficial glance at the sigillum Dei, one cannot help but notice a similarity with the fa mous T-figure of Ramon Llull's Ars brevis from 1308. In the chapter dedicated to that figure, Llull gives an extensive description of the fig­ure, its angles, and their meanings.31 Of course, the polygon in the T-figure is constructed from three triangles pointing at nine sets of principles, which is a completely different figure from the intertwined heptagons in the sigillum. One may be tempted to speculate on whether Llull took his inspiration from the chapter on the sigiUum Dei when he constructed his own theosophical system, exchanging a system of innate powers of sacred letters and words for a system of meaning and philosophical concepts, but this is impossible to prove. One should bear in mind, however, that the sigil was known independently as an amulet in Spain.32 The chapter on the sigil in Ganell's Summa is fa irly brief, certainly when com­pared to the section on the same topic in the London Honorius. It consists of two parts, the first detailing the construction of the sigil, the second summariz­ing the ends and purposes of its consecration. While the London Honorius gives extensive and detailed prescriptions, the author in the Summa does little else but list the letters and names that must be written in the figure; he does not need to do more since he conveniently provides a complete image (see fig. 2).33 One of the London books, Sloane 313 (fol. 4r), also has an image, but it is incomplete (see fig. 3). The reader may compare the two images to verify the differences. An interesting difference is that the heptagon surrounding Solomon's pentacle does not lock into the second, more intricate heptagon and thus creates what looks like a new heptagon not vouched for by either Honorius text but gratefully seized upon by John Dee when he constructed his own sigillum Dei. Also, the second and third heptagons in the Sloane figure are not intertwined as in the figure in Ganell, and Dee likewise places the third heptagon around the second. This proves that the Sloane figure, not the figure in the Summa, was Dee's source of inspiration. But it also proves something else. Regarding the third heptagon, the text of the London Honorius explicitly states, \"Hie tamen eptagonus infra predictum secundum concludetur\" (But this heptagon is enclosed beneath the aforemen­tioned second one).34 This description matches the image in the Summa and not the image in Sloane 313. It can therefore be deduced that the Sloane text must rely on earlier material very similar to the material in the Summa. The differences between the images and the texts of both Honorius sections on the sigillum are revealing and merit closer scrutiny, especially since they provide evidence that the Honorius material in the Summa predates the Sloane manuscripts.

Close inspection of Ganell's sigillum shows that the elaborate description is quite precise. Also, \"th\" can be found on an intersection of the heptagon, which is not the case in the Sloane figure. In the sigillum of Sloane 313, the syl­lable \"Ue\" of \"Ueham\" is not above the ''Ari' of \"Anael;' nor is ''am\" on an inter­section. The \"Y\" of \"Yalgal\" is not above the \"Ga\" of \"Gabriel;' nor is \"gal\" on an intersection. Inspection of the other four divine names produces the same re­sult. The inevitable conclusion is that the detailed and somewhat burdensome description of the sigillum in the Sloane manuscripts is intended to specify in words what was seen and carefully studied in the sigillum as portrayed in the Kassel manuscript. The sigillum of Sloane 313 seems to be an attempt to revisual­ize the long-winded Honorius text. In conclusion, I would like to draw the reader's attention to a third sample text concerning a prayer that is used in the consecration of the sigil.

Amen:' (LIH, §XCIX.2-4, pp. l08-9) After the detailed description of the sigil, the London Honorius continues (in §IV) by explaining that, fo llowing the invocation of the angels by means of the sigil, there should be an alteration in the wording of the prayer Ut tu, Domine, per annunciacionem. This is an obvious change, as the prayer is now no longer a prayer of consecration but of invocation or conjuration. Further adaptations for several additional purposes are suggested in §Cil. Ganell's Honorius, in the second part of the chapter on the sigillum, proposes similar changes but on a more organized scale. He lists six works of God (opera Dei, a Latin phrase for theurgy) that can be effected through the sigil: (1) the di­vine vision; (2) knowledge of God's power; (3) the absolution of sins; (4) the sanc­tification that precludes all relapse into mortal sin; (5) the redemption of the three souls37 from Purgatory; and (6) the power or dignification over all spirits.38 Related to each of these six works, the author lists a set of six alternative for­mulations of the sentence beginning with Ut abluto corpore (a phrase that ap­pears six times in prayers in the LIH and five times in those of the SSM). It will take the interested reader some effort to reconstruct the complete text of the Et tu, Domine, per annunciacionem prayer, for in Ganell's Honorius chapter the prayer (which is on L.4.f.16, line 44-L-4.f.17, line 6, as noted above) is not written out in full. Ai: one point, the author simply writes et cetera usque ibi (underlined in the passage quoted above), thereby referring to an earlier mentioned passage that he does not now wish to repeat. The passage is, in fa ct, in the prayer preced­ing the Et tu, Domine. The ritual of the consecration, it will be remembered, prescribes that on the thirteenth day (which is a Thursday, the dies jovi) after the twelve-day fast, and on receiving the body of Christ, the operator should recite Tu, Domine Ihesu Christe (of which only the relevant final section was quoted"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OP GOD 167 above: L.4.f. 16, lines 27-39). Several lines from this prayer (from terreas to ag­noscere) are to be repeated in the prayer that is recited shortly afterward. From this prayer it is the line \"ut abluto corpore tu visibiliter cum tuis 9 angelorum ordinibus me vi vente hoc nomen sacratissimum tuum ac sigillum benedicere et consecrare digneris\" (that when my body has been washed clean, you, visibly with your nine orders of angels, while I am alive, may deign to bless and conse­crate this, your most sacred name and seal-a line that occurs five times in the Honorius prayers in the SSM) that is adapted and made to accord with each of the six works listed above. In the case of the first work, the visio Dei, the sentence reads, \"Ut abluto corpore te visibiliter cum tuis 9 angelorum ordinibus me vi­vente mea possit anima collaudare\" (That when my body has been washed clean, while I am alive, my soul may be able to praise you visibly, with your nine orders of angels). In the case of the sixth and final work, the power over all spirits, the line runs, \"Ut abluto corpore me vivente per te et per tuos 9 angelorum ordines celestes igneas, aereas, aquaticas et terreas eficaciter possim astringere potes­tates\" (That when my body has been washed dean, while I am alive, through you and through your nine orders of angels I may be able efficaciously to constrain the heavenly, fiery, airy, watery, and earthly powers).39 Similar adaptations are proposed for the other works.40 When the consecration is completed, the phrase .. nomen sacratissimum tuum ac sigillum benedicere et consecrare\" is made re­dundant and replaced by fitting phrases to accompany the works that one wishes to perform with the sigil. When we now compare the two Honorius texts, it will become dear what the London Honorius has done. The only time that he uses the phrase \"nomen sacratissimum tuum ac sigillum benedicere et consecrare\" is at the very begin­ning of his book, when he consecrates the sigil. After that, the phrase is no lon­ger of use to him, so that he wittingly replaces it with the phrase that, according to Ganell's text, is specifically geared to the beatific vision: \"Ut abluto corpore te visibiliter cum tuis 9 angelorum ordinibus me vivente mea possit aninla col­laudare:' Twice he writes this phrase in full, later referring to it fo ur times by means of et cetera. 41 There is something peculiar about this procedure. After invoking the angels, the London Honorius says, one has to make a little adjustment in the petition: •ut tu, Domine, per annunciacionem, concepcionem\" et cetera \"hoc sacratissi­mum nomen ac sigillum tuum benedicere et consecrare digneris, ut per ipsum:' What text exactly is he referring to? Since this is the first time he mentions the prayer, the phrase etcetera cannot refer to an already mentioned passage. In fact, it refers to a text that appears twenty-eight pages later (in §XCIX). On top of that, this later segment contains no clue whatsoever that the two segments, namely, the incipit Ut tu, Domine and the bulk of the text from hoc sacratissimum nomen to cognoscere maiestatem, are in fact the beginning and end of one single prayer."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"168 INVOKING ANGELS That this is so can only be deduced from the reconstruction we have just made on the basis of the Summa. In other words, the London Honorius has been working from a text very similar to the Honorius chapters in Ganell. By adjusting the ritual exclusively to the visio Dei (which disrupts the logic of Ganell's text) and by placing the chapter on the sigillum at the beginning, the London author made a mistake that has left an indelible trace of his modus operandi. This, together with the points made above, is clear evidence that the materials in Ganell's Honorius chapters antedate the fo urteenth.century Sloane texts and constitute an Honorius tradi­tion outside Britain. There is one final issue in the consecration chapters that I would like to ad­dress, namely, the enigma of the Great Schemhamphoras, or the name of seventy­two letters that encompasses the sigillum. Honorius and the Schemhamphoras The Schemhamphoras was clearly important to Honorius, for the term appears several times in the text of the Liber iuratus. The references, however, are puz­zling and have caused the author to be imputed with ignorance of Hebrew and of the proper method of the Schemhamphoras. Honorius describes the Semen­phoras as the \"nomen Dei sacer et pretiosum 'quod 4 literis scribitur, ioht, he. vau, deleth\"' and as the \"nomen 'Semenphoras' 72literarum:'42 In particular, the list of seventy-two letters that encompasses the sigillum Dei is a conundrum in the absence of any explanation as to how it was constructed. This mystery is re­solved in Ganell's Summa; but before going into the particulars of Ganell's text regarding the \"Great Schemhamphoras;' I want to dwell for a moment on some of the fo rms of the Schemhamphoras, especially since the term is commonl}· and almost exclusively associated with the derivation of seventy-two trisyllabic names from three verses in Exodus. Both in the London Honorius and in the Honorius chapters in the Summa, the author is clearly concerned with a different type ofSchemhamphoras. In the two Honorius chapters in the Summa, the author refers to the \"seventy-two lit­tere magni nominis inetfabilis semanphoras;' whereby he clearly means one name of seventy-two letters. The word Semamphoras also appears in another context, namely, with the prayers pronounced at the consecration of the sigil. There we read: \"nomina ter quot vis de nominibus suprascriptis semamphoras\" (from the earlier mentioned names of the semamphoras, name three times as many as you like).43 The reference is to a group or groups of names mentioned in previous sections of the Summa. Ergo, there is more than one type of Schemhamphoras."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 169 Since the Schemhamphoras nowadays is mainly associated with Jewish and Christian Kabbalah from the early modern period, I will begin my discussion ofHonorius's use of the \"ineffable name\" with the earliest printed compendium of the Schemhamphoras, which shows strong awareness of both Kabbalah and the earlier traditions. In the Semiphoras und Schemhamphoras Salomonis regis, printed by Andreas Luppius in Wesel in 1686, one finds a fa irly comprehensive overview of several Schemhamphoras fo rms. 44 The author or compiler (possibly Luppius himself) explains that the name of God itself is a mystery and can only be gleaned through his works or derived from Holy Writ, \"durch die kunst Cabalisticam, Calculato­riam, Notariacam und Geometriam:'451he primary revelation of the divine name is the tetragrammaton, which is related to fo ur angelic and spiritual hierarchies (presented in pairs: Cherubin and Seraphin; Potestates and Virtutes; Archangelos and Angelos; sp iritus and animas hominum), to the fo ur angels ruling the fo ur corners of heaven, to the fo ur triplicities of the zodiac, to the fo ur elements, to the fo ur parts of man (anima, spiritus, corpus, genius), and so on. Luppius goes on to distinguish between several Schemhamphoras/Semiphoras groups. The first is the Schemhamphoras of Adam and comprises a set of seven \"Semipho­ras\" deriving from Adam's speaking (1) with God; (2) with angels and spirits; (3) with devils and with the dead; (4) with animals; (5) with plants; (6) with the winds; and (7) with the sun, the moon, and the stars. Of these, the fifth is espe­cially interesting: \"Das fiinffte Semiphoras, Lyacham, Lyalgena, Lyafaran, Ly­alfarab, Lebara, Lebarosin, Layaralus, so du Gewachsene als Biiume und Saamen wilt binden, so nenne diese Worte:' The names correspond fa irly well to the di­vine names in the sigillum, and are more or less identical to a similar list in one of Ganell's Schemhamphoras chapters (which also ascribes the same function to the names: \"cuius oficium est ligare sementes, herbas et arbores\").46 1he application of these names in the sigil shows that the use of the Schemhamphoras material is not restricted to the cryptic seventy-two-letter name in the outer circumfer­ence of the sigillum.

As with the Schemhamphoras of Adam. the Schemhamphoras of Moses can also be found in Ganell's Summa. 47 Luppius adds yet another set of \"Schemhamphoras,\" which revolve around the three seventy-two-letter verses of Exodus 14:19-21. When verses 19 and 21 are written from left to right and the middle verse (in Hebrew fashion) from right to left, the three lines yield (when read from top to bottom, beginning at the left) seventy-two names of God, each comprising three letters. When the divine epithets El or Jah are added, one gets a list of seventy-two three-syllable divine names. (There are clear traces of this list without the epithets in Ganell's Summa. )48 This is the method of Schemhamphoras known to Martin Luther in his anti-Semitic treatise Vo m Schem Hamphoras (1543), which he attributed to the rabbis' examination of the behind of a sow.49 It is also the method carefully expounded in an anti-Lutheran treatise in the fo rm of a catechism on the Schem Hammaphoras in a Wolfenbiittel manuscript. 5° A later redactor of the Swom Book realized the omission in the Honorius ritual and simply copied a chapter from Agrippa's De occulta philosophia, 51 where the system is expounded com­plete with tables and lists of names that can now also be found on fols. 77 and 78 of the British Library, Royalt7 A XLII. Luppius knew the method from Agrippa. whom he quotes, but he is unfortunately imprecise in his description of the method. He distinguishes between a unidirectional organization of the lines of the three verses (from right to left), which should yield names such as Vehuiah. Jeliel, Sitael, and so on, and an alternating direction of the lines of the three verses (left-right/right-left/left-right), which should yield a divine name of sev­enty-two letters. In this he is mistaken, for it is the second method that produces the Vehuiah list (and that he found in Agrippa). How the other method can pro­duce a name consisting of a sequence of seventy-two letters remains unclear. There is a passage in the De occulta philosophia52 where Agrippa speaks of the group of seventy-two names derived from the Exodus verses, which is called \"the name of seventy-two letters and schemhamphoras\" (which would suggest that the phrase \"the name of 72 letters\" is actually a label for a list of seventy-two trisyllabic names), to which he adds that many names have been derived from other scriptural passages as w ell, though he claims no knowledge of these. In a later passage, he is more explicit about the different ways in which Schemham­phoras can be constructed, also mentioning that the three Exodus verses can be"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 171 written in order consecutively from right to left (Agrippa does not mention the seventy-two-letter name here).53 This is clearly Luppius's source, and, given his mix-up, one might believe that he was simply mistaken regarding the seventy­two-letter name. Unlike Agrippa, however, he sees the seventy-two names and the seventy-two-letter name as two distinct results of different Schemhamphoras methods. Since Agrippa is not his only source of information, and since there are dear parallels with the Schemhamphoras chapters in Ganell, we may safely conclude that the notion of the seventy-two-letter name goes back to material predating late fifteenth-and early sixteenth-century interest in Kabbalah. 54 Ganell offers a solution relevant to the seventy-two-letter name in the sigil­lum Dei. There are two crucial chapters in the Summa where Ganell deals with the Schemhamphoras. The first, IL2.s,55 deals with the construction and conse­cration of the Ta bula Semamphoras that Ganell derives from the magical writ­ings of Solomon, more particularly from the tenth chapter on the Schemham­phoras in the Liber vite. The table is a square figure with geometrical patterns (reminiscent of patterned designs in Andalusian Muslim art), with the tetra­grammaton in the center and the names of governing angels in the corners. In the outer borders-geared to the cardinal directions-are the alphabets of four languages of which Ganell sums up the separate letters, adding the Latin equiva­lents in case of the non-Latin languages. In the north there is Chaldean (Cal­daycus Arabicorum ): alif stat pro a Latina; be pro b; te pro t; ce pro c; gim pro g; ha pro h, etc. In the west there is Hebrew: aleph pro a; beth pro b; gimel pro g; daled pro d; he pro e, etc. In the east one finds Greek: alpha pro a; betha pro b; gamma pro g; delta pro d, etc., and in the south there is Latin. 56 These are probably lan­guages known to Ganell, and the tabula is designed to show that power emanates from the divine tetragrammaton into the building blocks oflanguage. Words are empowered by the name YHVH. The second chapter on the Schemhamphoras, 11.2.7,57 deals with different kinds of Schemhamphoras, all designed to rule angels, demons, and nature. Ganell explains the powers, virtues, and meanings of the four letters of the tetra­grammaton and assigns to the divine name two distinct offices: a special one, which is to save people from peril, and a universal one, which is to encapsulate the virtues of all other words in the world (habere omnes virtutes quas omnia alia nomina mundi habent). The Great Schemhamphoras (the semamphoras Danielis), which comprehends all the other Schemhamphoras (et est ille qui est 72 litterarum ineffabile), has a similar function.58 This name is an acrostic con­structed from a list of divine names that Ganell attributes to Tot Grecus. The list opens with the word Ha (not a name) followed by seventy-two names. Making allowances for a few minor graphical variants (y/i and u/v), one will find that the list of initial letters neatly corresponds to the list in the Honorius chapters."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"172 INVOKING ANGELS In the edition of the London Honorius it is very hard to find parallels, except fo r a set of approximately twenty-three names that can be fo und in the \"100 Dei vi\\i nomina.\"59 Ha; 1.

Ye t Ganell also incorporates strictly Jewish materials in one of his Schemhamphoras chapters, notably the one on the permutations of the divine name. These permutations are brought about by writing the names of the letters in full. In the figures that accompany this chapter, one can see the first letter of the tetragrammaton, the yod, surrounded by the three letters that constitute the word yod, which again is encompassed by the names of each of these three let­ters, and so on [•-+;,•-+n\"i1N111']. 1his method, however, does not seem to be relevant fo r the Honorius chapter on the sigillum Dei, so I will refrain from a more detailed discussion.60 The great importance of the tetragrammaton (the Nomen coronatum, as Ganell calls it) has not prevented the divine name from falling victim to un­intentional permutations at the hands of the compiler of the London Honorius. A careful comparison of the LIH with the Summa brings to light two revealing instances. In a conjuration in the second part of the Liber iuratus, there is a line that in the version of the Summa reads: in nomine illius qui joth. he. vau. he. se Moysi nominavit. In the printed edition of the LIH we read: in nomine illius, qui Loke Henaf Hese Moysi nominavit. One can see immediately how a lack of knowl­edge led to a most unfortunate misreading. The second instance is less clumsy: where the LIH reads per hoc nomen Tetragrammaton ioht, he uau, deleth, the text in the Summa has the correct per hoc nomen ineffabile tetragramaton quid est"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 173 joth. he. vau. he. 61 From this we learn that the compiler of the LIH, and not the older Honorius, can be imputed with a lack of knowledge of Hebrew. Building the Heavenly Throne: Part Two of the Liber iuratus The consecration ritual and the sigillum are not the first se ctions that Ganell copied from the Liber iuratus. Even though the consecration ritual is a prerequi­site for the opera Dei that fo llow and also for the conjuration of the planetary, aerial, and terrestrial spirits as described in the second, third, and fo urth parts of the London Honorius, Ganell decided to incorporate later sections fr om the Liber iuratus in an earlier part of his Summa. They can be fo und in the third book, which deals specifically with angel and spirit invocations. In his introduc­tory chapter, Ganell does his best to distinguish these rituals from those of the nigromancers who, in caverna yspanie, have established their own rite and per­suaded Christians to abjure their own fa ith (lex) and ignore the pre-Easter fa sts. This nigromantic rite is not the true magic of Virgil and Solomon but sheer fo lly-the invention of the disciples of Mohammed and of idolatrous Jews, sons of Belial from the tribe of Dan, who made the golden calf and who crucified Christ. Jews and Mohammedans, he adds, will never successfully invoke a good angel, fo r this is the prerogative of orthodox Christians alone. 62 The first ritual with a clear parallel in the LIH that Ganell presents to his or­thodox magicians can be fo und in chapter III.1.2. It is the ritual for the invoca­tion of planetary angels (part two of the LIH). Though the text copied by Ganell dearly relates these angels to the seven planets, Ganell did not copy the division into planetary, aerial, and terrestrial spirits as a structuring device (in the way the London Honorius did), but rather presents the angels of the planets as sp iriti boni and the spirits of the air (later on in III.1.3, operatio 5) as spiriti maligni. For invoking the planetary angels, one should make a ten-foot circle on a clearing in a wood, or on a high tower, without being seen by other people. Within this circle, one should construct another circle (seven fe et across) of stones, three fe et high. In the center, one should write (following the fifth book of Solomon): \"Hoc est sedile contemplacio et visio angelica:' On the periphery, one should write the names of the angels of hours, days, and months (following the pre­scription by Honorius). This more or less corresponds to what one can read in the second part of the LIH, though the additional reference to the fifth book of Solomon may suggest that Ganell introduced some alterations.63 The actual operation (which takes three days) begins by attending Mass and finding a trustworthy priest. Also, the usual prayers from the Liber trium ani­marum should be recited: nos. 13 (in introitu), 9 (post offertorium), 1 and 2 (at the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"174 INVOKING ANGELS altar), 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 (after the Te igitur), 26 (after communion, by the priest), 19 and 20 (by the operans). On his way to church, the operator should recite no. 16, and in church the nos. 22, 14, 23, 21, 32, 33, 34, 29, and 30.64 After the consecration of the host, the priest should recite the prayer Tu, Domine Ihesu Christe, 65 and the operator nos. 17 (on leaving the church) and 15 (on arrival at the circle). This concludes the opus for day one. On the second day, the operator should return after compline and fumigate the circle, reciting prayer 17 and invoking Michael, Myel, Sarypyel, etc. He must then draw two new (concentric) circles one fo ot apart, with the names of the angels of hours, days, and months in between, and pronounce a brief prayer in which the angels on the command of their gover­nor Zebedeye are invoked to descend on the sedes Samaym. A brief description (lacking in the LIH) details that this new two-line circle is nine feet across and should be placed next (iuxta) to the other circle with the seven-foot stone ring. This larger circle is called the sedes Samaym or tronus celestis because there the planetary angels descend on the stones. The other nine-foot circle, in which the invocans stands, is called the tronus vel tribunal Salomonis. 66 The apex of the ritual comes on the third day, when the operator, having bathed, shaved, and dressed himself in white clothes, should stand either inside or outside the circle of the operator (circulus artisti) and recite prayer 31 (from the LTA) and the Oratio Salomonis (Pheton celi et terre conditor) while holding the consecrated sigillum Dei or the Ta bula Semamphoras in his right hand. The LIH gives virtually the same prescriptions, with the difference that the operator does not have an option and is positioned outside the circle with the Signum Domini in his right hand. Then follow extensive ritual invocations, indicated by brief titles in the text, comprising an invocatio angelorum, a sigillum et ligatio, a coniuratio, and a placacio. 67 After performing these invocations three times, thun­der will sound from heaven, angels will descend on the heavenly throne, and the operator can then reveal his wishes and question the angels on a multitude of subjects. The Summa makes a fa ir number of suggestions and lists a whole range of topics, with specifications at the end for the different groups of planetary angels, since their distinct influence on nature gives them specific expertise. For some reason, the compiler of the LIH interprets this grocery list as a table of contents with a list of chapter titles that he positioned at the very beginning of the text, much to the despair of the serious reader and the editor of his book. 68 Why he made this mistake remains a mystery, though it seems probable that the list was on a separate, perhaps loose, sheet of the document that he used. A conspicuous difference between the text of the SSM and the LIH is the absence of the seven paragraphs with detailed descriptions of the names, appearances, and regions of the planetary angels. Only very brieflines with remarks about their influence on"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 175 both human and nonhuman nature remain. Since these paragraphs seem to be such a cogent and sensible part of the text, one is inclined to believe that Ganell left them out because he did not require them as a structuring device for his presentation of the text. But this is by no means certain, and it is possible that a later editor added the information. Ganell rounds off his chapter by providing the complete text of the prayer Pheton celi et terre conditor. His source text obviously presented the full text in part one of the Liber, but since Ganell began by copying part two, he inadver­tently copied the incipit and the tag et cetera; realizing his oversight too late, he added the text at the end. Copying out part one in book IV, he remembered that he had already provided the full text, so now he simply settled for the incipit. The explicit of the prayer in chapter II1.1.2 has the line adapted to the \"visio Dei: ut abluto corpore te visibiliter cum tuis 9 angelorum ordinibus me vivente mea possit anima collaudare:'69 Thunder and Lightning: Part Three of the Liber iuratus Chapter 111.1.3 of the Summa, De invocacione spirituum, is more than sixty pages long and deals with the invocation and conjuration of demons in nine detailed operations.7° This is no business for the faint of heart, and the text contains a number of warnings for the operator to be very careful and not lose courage.71 The fifth operation deals with the seven kings (quos sanctus Honorius sic apel­labit) and occurs in the third part of the LIH. The seven kings are Barchan, Formyone, Yammax, Sarabotres, Harthau, Ababa, and Maymon.72 This operation (which also takes three days) begins on day 14 (following a thirteen-day ritual, as outlined-we may surmise-in LIH, part one) when the operator, attending Mass, should recite prayers 19 and 10 (19 and 20 according to the LIH) from the LTA and the priest should recite the prayer Domine Ihesu Christe, .fili Dei vivi. Leaving church, the operator should recite no. m then, reaching an appropriate spot where he can draw a circle, he should recite no. 15, and, drawing a nine-foot circle (within which are to be drawn two other circles, one foot apart, with angel names in between), he should recite no. 18. Outside this circle (divided into seven segments pointing in seven directions), seven names of the creator should be written either on the ground or on a sheet: Lyaly, Lyalg, Vehem, Yalgal, Narach, Lybarre, and Lybares. This concludes the ritual for the first day.73 On the second day, after the services from matins to compline, the operator must return to the circle, recite prayer 17, fumigate the circle, recite prayers 1 and 2, and delete the seven names. After a renewed fumigation, he should in­voke the spirits of the air from the seven directions of the circle. Then he should"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"176 INVOKING ANGELS kneel facing east, recite the Pheton celi et terre conditor prayer, and ask God to grant him power over the demons. Of the Pheton prayer, only the incipit is given (followed by \"et cetera\"), so that it is impossible to make out whether there should be an adaptation of the ut abluto corpore line. The London Honorius adds that tranquillity and douds will surround the place of the operation. This concludes the second day.74 As in the previous chapter, the climax of the ritual occur s on the third day. The operator should bring a whole set of props, including a wax candle, a censer, wine, a wand, and seven swords, and a company of up to seven associates to the circle. With the sigil in his right hand, he should then pronounce seven excita­tiones (the Ubi est sequences) from the seven directions of the circle (though standing outside the circle) to constrain the demons and force them to obey. To produce the desired effects, the procedure may be repeated up to nine times. These effects are sevenfold and are made fairly explicit: they include thunder, lightning, great winds, silver clouds, and earthquakes. The compiler of the Lon­don Honorius deemed it wise to leave them out, probably for want of a Mediter­ranean imagination or the presence of a volcano. He contents himself with a vague eorum motus insurgere, for which a stiff drink might be sufficient, so that the progress of the ritual need not be compromised. Ganell's Honorius is stricter: if the effects do not show after nine trials, one should cancel the show fo r the day and try again on the next.75 Should the Mediterranean climate (or the local drinking habits) comply, the operator must enter the circle and commence a new sequence of prayers (18, 1 and 2, 25, 27, 28, 31 from the L11\\), fumigations, and invocations comprising an applicatio, excitatio spirituum, oratio, invocatio, adiuratio, ligacio, and placacio. 1he texts of this sequence are virtually the same in the Summa and the LIH.76 As with the previous sequence, this new set of prayers and invocations should also have mind-staggering effects. Fearful apparitions and enticing visions will try to chase or lure the associates from the circle, but the operator should not lose heart and should calm his companions, point at the sigil of God, and chase the bad visions away. The London Honorius contents himself with a terse signa propria, but the Summa elaborates and mentions thunder and lightning, heavy rainfall, sudden snow, devouring lions, and beautiful girls. I gather lions and pretty girls were too rare and bad weather too common in late medieval Britain to make this passage agreeable to adepts of the occult. 77 Once the spirits of the air have been constrained by the conjurations, they can be petitioned. The end of chapter III.1.3 contains a lengthy list of topics and brief notices on the aerial spirits, which the London compiler placed at the beginning of the third part/8 thereby, once again, creating the wrong impression that it is a table of contents. As in the case of the sections on the planetary angels, the absence of the para-"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 177 graphs with detailed descriptions of the aerial spirits also seems to suggest that Ganell, though quoting from them piecemeal, decided to leave them out of his presentation. Let me conclude my description of these two operations for the invocation of planetary and aerial spirits by commenting briefly on Honorius's references to sigils. Hedegard, in the introduction to his edition of the LIH, wondered whether the original Liber had not contained images of the supplementary sigils that the text refers to, namely, the sigillum angelorum, the sigillum aereorum, and the sigillum terreorum. From the Honorius sections of the Summa we learn that the sigillum Dei and the Ta bula Semamphoras (of which there are images in the Summa) are important, if not indispensable, props fo r the operations. Addition­ally, there are several references to sigils of the angels and of the aerial and the terrestrial spirits, not only in the Honorius sections but also elsewhere in the Summa, without-it should be added-images of these sigils. This is not surpris­ing, as these sigils are presented as texts and not as figures.79 Chapter 111.1.3 does contain images of sigils (such as the .figura Amaym) that look like shields, but these are not related to the Honorius rituals.80 A Summary of the Evidence A careful comparison of the Honorius sections in the Summa sacre magice and the text of the Sloane manuscripts brings to light a number of new insights re­garding the Liber iuratus. For the benefit of the reader, I would like to summa­rize my most important findings and conclusions in five points. 1. The Liber iuratus used by Ganell predates the text as contained in the Sloane manuscripts. The London Honorius is an unbalanced and disorganized compo­sition. This is certainly due to a lack of skill or knowledge on the part of one or more of the editors (which can be shown from the errors in the tetragramma­ton), but part of the disorder may also be attributed to the poor condition of one of the source manuscripts (whereby a list of petitions was mistaken fo r a table of contents). The inconsistencies and flaws that I noted in some of the prayers and in the presentation of the sigillum Dei prove that Ganell's copy of the Liber is an older and more reliable source. At the same time, there is a fa ir chance that Ganell's presentation of the material bears the imprint of his own editorial deci­sions and prejudices. Ganell's personal input may explain the absence of the well-ordered and detailed descriptions of the planetary and aerial spirits, but it does not explain the reliance of the Honorius sections on the Liber trium ani­marum and the Schemhamphoras, which are an authentic part of the Honorius text (to which Ganell himself testifies by calling the Honorius ritual an ars nova"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"178 INVOKING ANGELS and which can also be proved from the sequence of seventy-two letters in the London versions). One of the compilers (in the transmission history) of the LIH did not have a Liber trium animarum at his disposal, so that, while copying the prayer numbers, he came up with a new liturgy that he derived from the glossed redaction of the Ars notoria (possibly because a portion of that text was also la­beled an ars nova). If this is true, it is further proof of the poor condition of the source manuscript. 2. Ganell's copy of the Liber iuratus appears to be a cogent and well-structured collection of ritual operations. It begins with a consecration ritual for the opera­tor and the sigillum Dei. Once the sigil and the operator have been ritually puri­fied and prepared, a number of theurgical operations (six in all) can be performed using the prayers and the assistant priest from the consecration rite. One par­ticular line in the prayers, however, needs to be adjusted to the new situation, namely, the ut abluto corpore line (which in the consecration rite is geared to the sigillum and the Schemhamphoras), for which the text provides six alternative formulations. The Liber iuratus of the Sloane manuscripts disrupts this order by opening the text with a description and a brief consecration of the sigillum and then using the consecration rite as a ritual for obtaining the visio Dei (the first of the theurgical operations). This is evident from the use of the adapted ut abluto corpore line and the insertion of the references to the heavenly palace in the London version. It is not clear when this disruption was introduced, but it is possible that it occurred as a reaction to papal condemnations that may, in the London redaction, also have inspired the added origin myth of the council of magicians. 3· Following the organization of the Liber as presented by Ganell in chap­ters IV.1.5 and IV.1.6, one can imagine a hypothetical Urfassung comprising seven parts: a consecration ritual followed by six theurgical operations (a magi­cal parallel to the six days of creation). These six theurgical operations are not represented in Ganell, unless the invocations of the planetary and aerial spirits constitute two of these. In the chapter on the planetary spirits, there is an adap­tation of the ut abluto corpore line that adapts one of the prayers to the visio Dei, but the purpose of the ritual is not specifically the visio Dei but the visio angelica. On the whole, it seems more likely that the six theurgical operations are not writ­ten out in Ganell's Summa because they are intended to be modeled on the con­secration-ritual (which would explain the \"disruption\" in part one of the LIH). The spirit invocation rituals are then separate and additional operations. How many of these separate and additional operations there were in our hy­pothetical source is not entirely dear. The LIH says that there are three classes of angels (celestial, aerial, and terrestrial}, 81 which warrants at least three operations (for which there are matches in the Summa and the LIH). Yet the operation for"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SJGJL OF GOD 17 9 the terrestrial spirits is extremely brief in the LIH and absent, as a separate ritual, from the SSM (at least I was unable to find it). The LIH says that there is a fifth part with expository notes, but some of these, notably on the theurgical opera­tions, go with the description of the sigillum in the SSM and are hence an inte­grated part of the sections to which they apply. That the two spirit operations (planetary spirits and aerial spirits) are well integrated in the structure of book three of the SSM suggests that further research on Ganell's text is ·required to establish whether or not there are additional Honorius sections. 4. Ganell's text does not support the general hypothesis that the LIH is made up of (at least) two different texts (a manual of demonic magic [parts 2-4 of the LIH] and a theurgical treatise [part 1 of the LIH] ). The use of the sigillum Dei and the Ta bula Semamphoras, as well as the \"recycling'' of several prayers and voces magicae, not to mention the constant reference to the Liber trium ani­marum, creates a strong set of links between the consecration ritual (IV.1.5 and IV.1.6) and the spirit invocations (III.1.2 and III.1.3, op. 5). It also integrates these portions of Honorius in the overall structure of the Summa, so that one should keep in mind that Ganell himself may have enhanced this appearance of cohe­sion. No matter what Ganell has added or changed, however, it remains clear that the source texts for Ganell's redaction and the LIH strongly resembled each other. 5· References to Jewish and Islamic magic are enticing features of the Liber iuratus. The claim that only orthodox Christians can be successful magicians is present in both the London version and a chapter of the Summa. There is no reason to believe that Ganell's Honorius source did not share this bias, but there seems to be no direct quotation from this Honorius source to prove this. Refer­ences to Islam are conspicuously absent from the London version, which (in­stead) discredits the efficacy of angel magic operations as performed by Jews. At the same time, the London version shows even stronger traces of Jewish influ­ence than Ganell's version (in the references to the heavenly palaces, which are absent from Ganell's text). The Honorius chapters in the Summa, by contrast, derive material fr om Jewish mystical and kabbalistic sources but display no spe­cific disrespect for Jews as magicians. A distinguishing fe ature of the Honorius chapters in the SSM is rather the anti-Islamic polemics. It is not inconceivable that Ganell's personal influence contributed to this characteristic, but if the \"orig­inal\" Liber iuratus originated in a reconquista context (which is more than likely), a similar attitude might be expected in Ganell's Honorius source. The absence of the references to Islam in the London version, along with the addition of the story of the council of magicians and the foregrounding of the visio Dei in the consecration ritual, constitutes clear evidence that the text was adapted to a new and different context."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"180 INVOKING ANGELS The history of the reception and adaptation of the Liber iuratus did not end with the editors and copyists responsible for the Sloane manuscripts. In the six­teenth century a new chapter was added to the tradition. Conclusion: John Dee and the Honorius Tradition On Saturday, March 10, 1582, two days after Edward Kelley had first introduced himself to John Dee at Mortlake under the name Edward Talbot, the angel Uriel gave instructions through him regarding a foursquare table upon which should be set the sigillum Dei, \"which is already .. perfected in a boke of thyne:' In a marginal note in his diary, commenting on the word \"perfected;' Dee added: \"*Erronice, contra ignorantiam meam, vide post:' Toward Kelley, who had been bent on discrediting the reputation of Barnabas Saul, Dee's previous medium in his angel communications, who had left Dee's household a few days before, John Dee pleaded unfamiliarity with the \"vulgarly accounted magic:' Talbot, who had been introduced as a very learned man by his friend Mr. Clerkson over dinner on Friday evening, had been all too eager to instruct Dee in the magical arts. That very evening he would have been able to take a look at the magical books in Dee's library and present himself the next day as a superior medium, not only offering more drama in the appearance of the angels but also outdoing the knowledge of magic contained in the books of John Dee. 82 The ignorance of Dee and the learning of Kelley are both to be taken with a pinch of salt. If by March 1582 Dee had already studied the Liber iuratus and the chapters in Ganell, he would have noticed, as we did above, the discrepancies between them and would have been aware of the tradition and development of the ritual. While Dee would have learned about the progressive character of magic and would have accepted novel applications of older fo rms, Kelley, for his part, would have been less interested in studying Dee's sources than in deriving from them optically interesting features such as the sigillum. The \"perfected· image may have been the sketchy illustration in what is now Sloane 313, or the completed image in Ganell's Summa. As I argued earlier, the Sloane figure is the most likely candidate for its similarities with Dee's own sigil, but for a proper understanding of its construction Dee would have been well served by Ganell's text. Ye t this knowledge is annulled and brushed aside by Kelley's angels, who have their own novel and quite creative dynamics in building the sigillum Dei. The seventy-two-letter Schemhamphoras in the encompassing circle is made redundant and replaced by a division in fo rty letters that constitute seven angel names composed by going round the circle clockwise and counterclockwise. A host of angels make their appearance, each bearing a letter or sign that has its"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 181 own special place in the sigil. All of this was new to Dee, and, no doubt im­pressed by what we now tend to recognize as Kelley's charismatic and dramatic qualities, he acknowledged his ignorance and deemed the older tradition of the sigil an error. As the later (perhaps the London) Honorius copied the vacuous prayer numbers of the ritual and filled them with a new content derived from the Ars notoria, so Dee and Kelley stripped the sigil of God of its older content and filled it with a new passion fo r the angelic world. Magic has this singular capacity to inspire its practitioners and rise like a phoenix from whatever ashes it has been cast into by historical contingency. Dee was looking not for historical truth but for metaphysical truth. Histori­ans of magic are usually quite content with the fo rmer. The big codex with which Dee could apparently part without regret on his long continental journey is thus of tremendous importance for the scholar. It is a book that will cause several chapters in the history of magic to be rewritten (the Honorius tradition to begin with), and that will make the historian aware of the importance of the Medi­terranean coastal region {the Baleares, southern France, eastern Spain) fo r the development not only of Jewish Kabbalah and the Lullian art,83 or of heresies such as Catharism, but also of Christian magic in the thirteenth and fo urteenth centuries. The Inquisition no doubt eradicated many of the traces of this magi­cal tradition, and it is telling that its remnants have to be looked for in periph­eral and more northern regions. Ganell's efforts in compiling a collection of all the texts known to him in the fo urteenth century present us with new sources for a better assessment of the influence of Jewish and Arabic magic and also raise new questions regarding the dating of magical traditions. I have not speculated on a date of origin fo r the Honorius ritual, basically because I fe el quite content with making it contemporary with the later years of Llull (who died in 1316), which is not very much earlier than the period of com­position scholars have suggested so far. Yet the fact that Ganell has documented an Honorius text (an ars nova) that stands in a longer tradition no longer auto­matically excludes a possible date of origin somewhere in the thirteenth century.

Boudet notes that in 1347 Ganell personally handed over a copy (probably his own) of the Liber iuratus to one Etienne Pepin, who was involved in a sorcery trial (Boudet refers to Edmond Falgairolle, Un envoutement en Gevaudan en limmie 1347 [Nimes: Catelan, 1892), 68-70}. 3· The Latin text is in Kassel, Universitatsbihliothek Kassel/Landesbibliothek und Murhardsche Bibliothek der Stadt Kassel, 4\" astron. 3; the German translation is in Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preus­sischer Kulturbesitz, Germ., fol. 903. In what fo llows, references to the Latin text of the Summa sucre magice (hereafter SSM) fo llow the pagination of the manuscript added by John Dee. References to the German translation (hereafter SSMG) fo llow the conventional foliation of the manuscript. An edition of the text is currently being prepared by Damaris Gehr from Basel. The codex with the Latin text consisted of seventeen quires, four of which (9, 12, 14, 16) are now missing. Since Dee's foliation shows similar lacunae, we may conclude that he was in possession of the complete copy. The German transla­tion is based on the complete text, thus providing material otherwise lost. Yet even th is German trans­lation is defective, notably in the Honorius section, where several pages of the text were not bound into the book, so that there is now a lacuna between fol. 474v and fol. 476r, compensated for by an inserted leaf (fol. 475) in an illegible hand with a \"sketchy» text intended to bridge the evident gap between the two text segments. There is another manuscript containing part of Ganell's Latin text at Halle, Universitats-und Landesbibliothek Sachsen-Anhalt, 14. B. 36 (hereafter Hall e, ULB). The scribe of this manuscript copied a number of sections from Ganell's Summa almost verbatim, including the ritual of the second part of the London Liber iuratus and Ganell's Almandal chapter. SSM, L.3.f.2, line 32-L.3.f.8, line 14, corresponds almost verbatim to Halle, ULB, fols. 226r, line 17-229v, line 33 and contains nearly all of the text of LIH, §§CIII-CXV. The scribe of the Halle manuscript seems to have been primarily concerned with the Liber Razielis, but he incorporated in his compilation a section on the A/mandai. The materials for this he derived directly from the Summa by Ganell, who, in his third book, describes several lengthy \"mandai\" rituals, at least two of which (and perhaps more) he copied from Honorius's Liber iuratus. On the Halle manuscript, see Reimund Leicht, Astrologumena ]udaica: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der astrologischen Literatur der ]uden (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2.oo6), 262-90. With special regards to Dr. Leicht for drawing my attention to the Almandal texts in the Halle manuscript. 4· SSM, V.2.13 (L.s.f.102, line 24); Ganell mentions \"12 annos proximos futuros,\" beginning with 1346. Dee copied that year in the margin as a reminder of when the text was written. In SSM 111.1.3 (I..3.f.39.line 2.6) there is another reference to the year 1346 in a passage in which Ganelllaments the decline in the knowledge of the Ars magica. 5. On Dee and Moritz ofHessen, see Bruce'[ Moran, 'Ihe Alchemical Wo rld of the German Court: Occult Philosophy and Chemical Medicine in the Circle of Moritz of Hessen (1572-1632) (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1991), 92-94. 6. The German translator was evidently unfamiliar with the Liber iuratus. In the table of con­tents, he translated the title of chapter IV.1.5 as \"Das funlftte von der Ehrwerdigen heiligung» (SSMG, fo l. sv), unaware of the fact that honorij is a name rather than an adjective. In the actual chapter itself (SSMG, fo l. 47ov), he corrects himself by translating \"Das funffte Capittell von der heiligung Honorij,\" without correcting the phrase in the table of contents. 7-SSM, 111.1.2-3 contain the text of LIH, parts 2 (§§CIII-CXV) and 3 (§§CXVI-CXXXIII). 8. For instance, Ganell's chapter on the Almat1dal, which survives in the German translation as well as in Halle, ULB, 14. B. 36 (fols. 230r-233v), bears great resemblance to the A/mandai in the Flor­entine manuscript, Biblioteca nazionale centrale di Firenze, II.III.2.14, fols. 74v-78v. Yet the style and wording are completely different. Ganell's use of the Honorius text, on the other hand, is very close to the \"original.\" 9. See, e.g., SSM, L.2.f.2o, lines 28-29: Ita docet Honorius in sua autentica invocatione libri sacri (the reference is to LIH, §CXXXII1.38, p. 141); SSM, L2..f.21,1ine 25 (Honorius in toto suo libra); and L.4.f.49 (dixit Sanctus Honorius in libro jurato)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 185 10. SSM, IV.2.3, L.4.f.38-L.4.f.50. Regarding these prayers he remarks, \"sunt orationes artis nove vel modeme.\" John Dee numbered the prayers of the Ars nova in the margin of the manuscript (nos. 1-51), which testifies to his careful study (and probably also practice) of the ritual. One gets the impres­sion that the Ars nova is some kind of liturgical innovation in occult circles at the time of Ganell or earlier, when traditional magical texts were revised and upgraded. There is a chapter in the Summa (IV.1.4) dealing with thirty prayers of the ars vetus; all of these prayers are to be used for consecration purposes. Compared with these, Honorius, in Ganell's eyes, offers a sacratio moderna (SSM, IV.1.4, l.4.f.15, line 27). \"The term Ars nova is also used for liturgical innovations in the second phase of the development of the Ars notoria; there the An nova L� a collection often prayers contained f n the Flores aurei. See Julien Veronese, \"Les anges dans I' Ars notoria: Revelation, processus visionnaire et angelo­logie;' in Boudet, Brese, and Grevin, \"Les anges et Ia magie au Moyen Age;• 819-22. From SSM, chapter JY.z.3, it is not clear what the title of this Book of Three Souls refers to. One is inclined to believe that these are the three souls of man. If the prayers were modeled on Jewish sources, the souls would be rrefesh, ruilh, and neshamah, of which the third is a higher power that enables man to mystically ap­prehend the Godhead. See Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (New Yo rk: Penguin, 1974), 155. u. Echoes of the very terse fourth part of the LIH can be found in SSM, L.t.f.23, line 42-L.1.£z4, line 3, and L.3.f.59 (notably the text of the sigillum tem of LIH, §CXXXV.13-14, p. 143). Part five of the London text is probably an editorial addition of the compiler. It contains bits and pieces of informa­tion that should have been inserted in the preceding parts in their appropriate places. For a schematic overview of the textual parallels, see the appendix at the end of this chapter. 12. See, e.g., SSM, l.3.f.39, line 44; L.3.f.41, line n; and L.3.f.47, line 3· 13. In the prologue of the Liber iuratus of the Sloane manuscripts, Honorius states that he con­sulted the angel Hocrohel and derived his material from seven volumes of magic to compose ninety­three chapters (LIH, §1.16, p. 61). Hedegard speculates on the meaning of this reference: the number seven might be symbolical. or the I.IH might be a condensed version of one big book or a florilegium from several books. Honorius's ambition to compose a Liber in five parts with ninety-three chapters finds an interesting parallel in Ganell's opus magnum, which consists of five parts and eighty-five chapters. 1he ambitions of the owner or editor of the German version of the Summa went even fur­ther. The initial pages of the table of contents of the original translator of Ganell's book were removed and replaced by three leaves written in a different hand and containing a title page (Arbatel De magia veterum, Von der Magia oder geistlichen Kunst) and a leaf with a Liber prim us, which turns out to be an introduction to magic. All five sections of the book were renumbered (book I became III, and book V became VII), and at the end (SSMG, fol. 8o6v) \"finis 8 libri\" was mistakenly written. A fairly exten­sive magical text added after the Ganell book is therefore labeled part 9: \"Tomus Nonus et Ultimus I Das Neund unnd letzte buch der Magia Naturalis\" (SSMG, fols. 8o7r-892r). Books 2 and 8 are not present. 14. This did not prevent the Liber iuratus from bearing the clear imprint of Jewish traditions; see Katelyn Mesler's chapter in this volume. A reference to Metatron can be found in SSM, L.2.f.22, line 18. See esp. note 62 below on Ganell's anti-Islamic polemic. 15. SSM, L.4.f.23,1ines Sff. 16. A similar passage appears in LIH, §IV. 51, p. 69. 17. A similar passage appears in LIH, §IV.57, p. 70. 18. There is an almost verbatim correspondence with IJH, §LII.l-10, pp. 91-92. 19.

There is an almost verbatim correspondence with LIH, §XCIX.1-4 (of the prayer Et tu, Domine, per annunciacionem; the incipit can be found in §IV.59, p. 70) and §C.1-14, pp. 108-10. Sig­nificant differences are the absence of the reference to the Libcr trium animarum in the London Hono­rius, and the absence of the list of one hundred names (LIII, §Cb-8, p. 112) from Ganell's Honorius. 21.

Induction of visions during sleep is one of the features Kieckhefer identified as linking thr Sworn Book with Jewish cultural practices (\"Devil's Contemplatives,\" 256). Obviously, dream incuba­tion Is not strictly a Jewish practice; sleeping visions are also a central feature of the ritual practice described in the John of Morigny's Liber florum celestis doctrine. The theme of revelations during sleep recurs in the Anacrisis, a work by the Majorcan hermit Pelagius (who died in 148 0); see Gilly, \"Be­tween Paracelsus, Pelagius, and Ganellus,\" 288-89.

In the fifteenth century it was to have belonged to the fa mous Marquis.. writer and magus Don Enrique de Villena. The Duke of Alcala, viceroy of Naples, had it printed on vellum in the seventeenth century; as appears from a letter by a Spanish Jesuit to Athanasius Kircher (cf. Oedipus aegyptiacus, II 2., 479-83). Naturally Kircher seized the opportunity to print an image of this sigil to illustrate his chapter on the Mllgia hieroglyphica, at the same time providing a lengthy commentary:' Joseph H. Peterson incorporated Kircher's text in the second appendix of his John Dee's Five Books of Mystery: Original Sourcebook of Enochian Magic (Boston: Weiser/Red Wheel, 2003). 433-35. The sigil as reprinted by Kircher, it will be noted, is defective. Bruno used the heptagon in a figure of the seven planets in his De rerum principiis. See Giordano Bruno, Opere magiche, ed. S. Bassi. E. Scapparone, and N. Tirinnanzi (Milan: Adelphi Edizioni, 2003), 658. 33· It is interesting to see that Ganell's A/mandai chapter, unfortunately missing from the Kassd manuscript but extant in the Halle copy and also in the German translation, has no A/mandai image. Instead, it provides a description of the image that seems to match very well the Almandal images found in Firenze, Biblioteca nazionale centrale, II.II1.2t4, fol. 74v. 34· LIH, §IV:12, p. 67. The phrase puzzled the editor (see pp. 155-56). 35. Several grammarians have pointed out that \"h\" is not a letter.

There are other clues that the London author was actually describing a sigiUum that he had seen. According to Ganell's text, the words on the third heptagon should read: �ad vos Duynas Gyram Gravy Aysaram Alpha:' In the London text this is: \"Vos Duynas Gyram Gram Aysaram Alpha oo· (§IV:40-41, p. 69). The fo ur strokes of \"uy\" could easily be mistaken for an \"m:' but the point to note here is the \"ad vos\" sequence that the London author interprets as \"oo vos:' The p�rase actually means \"to you\" (after which follow the divine names), which is clear from Ganell's text but not from the figure"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"HONORIUS AND THE SIGIL OF GOD 187 if one traces the sequence clockwise, for then the line begins with \"Vas\" and ends with two rounded pen strokes, which (after Alpha) can easily be interpreted as co. 37. Could this be the tripartite soul of man, comprising the anima vegetativa, the anima sensitiva, and the anima rationalis? Or is there a link with the three souls from the title of the Liber trium animarum? 38. Of these six works of God, the first five are listed at the end of the first part and in the fifth part of the LIH, i.e., in §CII.1 (p. u5) and §CXXXVI.3 (p. 144), respectively. 39.

Luppius did not derive this information from Agrippa, and his use of the material may well testify to the reception of either Ganell's Summa or of one or more of his sources (possibly material as we find it in the Halle manuscript) in Germany. SSM, IL2.7, L.2.f.23, line 28-L.2.f.24, line 6, contains the seven segments of Adam's Schemhamphoras, albeit in slightly different fo rm (and in the sequence 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 2). An expanded version can be fo und in the Schemhamphoras section of the Halle manuscript. According to the incipit (fol. 244r, line 1), this Liber Semiphoras was translated from Hebrew into Latin, which would mean that the materials presented by the Halle manuscript and Ganell's Summa derive immediately from Hebrew sources. The Schemhamphoras of Adam is on fols. 246v, line 10-247r, line 12. The Halle manuscript further contains afigura Semyphoras very similar to the image in the Summa (see fol. 249r) and the Glosae Semiphoras by Sadoch )udaeus (inc. fol. 249v). The translation was commissioned by Alphonse X of Castile; on this manuscript, see Boudet, Entre science et nigromance, 196-97. 47· SSM, L.2.f.24, lines 7-16. As sources of his Schemhamphoras material, Ganell mentions Solo­mon's Liber vite and To� Grecus.

The omission of the fourth secta (the Mohammedans) may be explained from the north­em European context of the Sloane manuscripts. In IILI.1, Ganell does not specifically mention the pagani, but he does include them in other references to the four sectae elsewhere in the Summa. It is unclear whether his denunciation of Jewish and Islamic magic reflect� GaneU's personal beliefs or whether the passage was copied from one of his sources (whether this was a Liber iuratus I cannot prove). The remarks about the \"sons of Belial\" display an aversion that does not seem to match the tone in the preceding chapters on the Sc!Iemhamphoras. However, in the chapter on the Liber trium animarum (SSM IV.3.2), Ganell explains that the magic of a secta is determined by that secta's creed. In all, there are four sectae using four distinct languages (alphabets), namely, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek. All four sectae believe in God and thus have (magical) names to constrain the enemies of God. \"Ideo dixit sanctus Honorius in libro jurato quod fides operatur in unoquoque, sive bona fuit, sive mala. Quia fides male secte vocatur mala, et bone bona\" (L.4.f.49, lines 41-43). The reference is to a line that we know from the LIH: \"Et quia fidem mala habent, opera eorum null a\" (§II1.18, p. 66), but this brief quotation does not make clear which religions precisely Ganell's Honorius source considers good or bad. Ganell's (or perhaps Honorius's?) derision is aimed mainly at Islam (L.4.f.so, lines 4-5: \"nullus fuit maior cacax quam Machometus\"). 63.

Ganell abbreviates the list of twenty-five angel names (L/H, §CXIV.s): \"Michael, Myel, Sarypyel etc.\" Ganell does provide a complete list on the following page (L.3.f-4) comprising not twenty-five but twenty-six names. The angel Sathquyel, who in the LIH belongs both to Saturn and to Jupiter, is in fact a conflation of Satriquyel (Saturn) and Satquyel (Jupiter). Of the London manuscripts, only B (Sloane 313) seems to be aware of the distinction (see Hedegard's note on p. 197). 67. The texts of these prayers in the Summa and the LIH are virtually identical. In the invocatio (SSM, L.).f.4,1ines 11-33 =Halle, ULB, fol. 227V, lines 12-38 = LIH, §CXV.5-13, p. 121), names 1-38 from the list of one hundred divine names are written in full in the Summa; the LIH simply gives the num­bers 1-38.

The SSM adds a couple of lines (L.3.f.29, line 34-L.3.f.JO, line 7) that are not in the LIH and that comment on the circle that apparently can also be used for other operations (these additional lines are most probably a comment added by Ganell him­self).

The ab­breviation suggests that he used the text in previous sections (which is correct; cf.

One of the conjurations contains a list of names from the \"too Dei vivi nomina;· of which Ganell enumerates only the numbers 82-90, and a few lines later, 91-96 (L.3.f.36, lines 8-9 and '1.1).

The line \"quatinus vos Barthan ... et eos spiritus' et cetera\" conceals a ten-line sequence in the SSM, l..J.LJ6,lines '1.1-30. Also, Ganell misses out on occasion: LIH, §CXXX-111.32 (p. 140) is not in the SSM chapter, but this is probably due to a \"saute du meme a meme\" brought about by the recurring phrase fkxis genibus in 32 and 33· 77-Cf.

In his 1998 article \"The Devil's Contemplatives: The Liber iuratus, the Liber visionum, and Christian Ap­propriation of Jewish Occultism;' Richard Kieckhefer first proposed the thesis that there were elements in both works that appeared to attest to an influence from Jewish mysticism. Kieckhefer's central contention was that these works \"draw upon Jewish precedent, not so much for particular techniques but rather fo r fundamental conceptions of spiritual process:'2 With respect to the Liber iuratus, Kieckhefer identified a number of things that seemed to indicate a more specific familiarity with and incorporation of ideas taken from Jewish mysti­cism.3 Additional evidence in support of Kieckhefer's thesis has been adduced by scholars working on the text over the intervening years, most recently in the chapter by Katelyn Mesler in this volume. It is now clear that the text inter­weaves liturgical strands from Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.4 With respect to John of Morigny's Liber jlorum, Kieckhefer's thesis was more speculative; he did not attempt to claim any actual Jewish sources or background fo r the work, noting only that John, like the master of the Sworn Book, somehow I am grateful to the American Philosophical Society and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for the support that allowed me to consult most of the manuscripts of John of Morigny listed in Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter. I would also like to thank Joseph Goering and Karen Kletter for their responses to early drafts of this essay, and the Academy of Jewish-Christian Studies for sponsoring the session in which I first delivered it, at the Forty-first International Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2006. I learned much from these discussions; any er­rors that remain are, of course, my own."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 193 seems to have \"imbibed a mentality that would have been more readily per­ceived as coherent within Jewish culture:'5 Any fu rther evidence of real Jewish influence on this text (or of John of Morigny's perception of Jewishness in the work) would have been difficult for Kieckhefer to assess, since at the time of writ­ing he had access to only one manuscript version of the Liber jlorum, which was a copy of a late, nonauthorial redaction of the prayers from which all autobio­graphical materials had been excised. 6 The only other copy known to us at that time was that in Miinchen, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 276, which is also missing the introductory autobiographical materials and most of the third book. We had only just discovered copies of the full New Compilation text, with these autobiographical elements complete, when Conjuring Spirits went to press, while the discovery of John's first draft, the original Old Compilation, still waited in the wings. I examined a copy of the Old Compilation text fo r the first time in the Bodle­ian Library in the summer of 2004. This version, unlike all others known up to that time, includes instructions fo r the production of a large number of figures intended as meditative fo cal points to go along with the prayers. According to John, these figures are supposed to include one of the fo ur letters of the tetra­grammaton, in Hebrew, in each of the fo ur corners of the page. This directive is canceled in the rewritten version of this part of the text in the New Compilation copy because John learned in a vision that the letters of the divine name were supposed to be replaced by the fo ur nails of the crucifixion. John himself inter­prets this displacement as a caution against Judaizing. I will return to this vision and its exegesis in more detail shortly, but fo r now it is sufficient to note that the issues surrounding the presence and absence of the Hebrew letters in the figures can be shown to be part of a larger movement through which John both explains and justifies the relation between his own Old and New Compilation texts as parallel to that of the Old and New Testa­ments. Throughout John's New Compilation Liber figurarum, themes of divine covenant recur, deriving from an exegetical habit of thought in which the Old contains typological prefigurations of the New, and the New fu lfills the Old. Leaving aside for a moment the questions surrounding John's possible Jewish sources, there is independent value in examining the ideas about Judaism that emerge here, since they may have implications that relate to Kieckhefer's thesis. At the very least, with these new materials in hand, the time is ripe for a reas­sessment of the questions Kieckhefer raised. An idea of Judaism connected to the theme of Christian supersession is also evident in the London version of the Sworn Book, which argues that the rituals of the book may not be brought to effect by pagan or Jewish users, although fo r different reasons. Pagan users are identified as idolaters who have put God aside"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"194 INVOKING ANGELS to make sacrifices to demons; hence they lack the power of faith in the true God; but Jewish users, who do worship the true God (although not in the right way), have the power to command spirits but no longer to get true answers from them? As will be shown, this claim, too, is grounded in an idea of super­session of covenant. The nuances of the restrictions imposed upon Jews here are of interest to us in what they tell us about the attitude of the compiler of the London version of the Sworn Book toward the Jewish ideas and materials he inherited. Because of the persistence of the theme of covenant in both of these early fourteenth-century works of angel magic, it still makes sense to examine the London version of the Sworn Book in conjunction with John of Morigny's text. While there is not yet enough data available to identify with certainty the range of actual Jewish sources that might have been available to either John of Morigny or the master of the Sworn Book, 8 or what forms these might have taken, nevertheless it is evident that both texts adopt certain positions with respect to an idea of Judaism. In both cases this idea has positive as well as negative con­tent. In both cases, too, it is informed by ideas that are equally influenced by theological and patristic traditions about Judaism and ideas that have come through the magical literature. In order to understand the ways in which they may have used or responded to their Jewish sources (or indeed responded to their sources as Jewish, which may be a diff erent matter), then, it makes sense to look at what their idea of Judaism seems to be-something that will necessarily be connected to how they understand themselves as Christian rather than Jewish, New Covenant rather than Old Covenant. In this essay I isolate the moments in both the Liber jlorum and the London version of the Liber iuratus that dwell on the text's relation to Judaism in order to explicate the different ways in which the authors of each text read the divine operations in which they were engaged as part of a larger pattern of salvation history. 1. Ideas of Judaism in John of Morigny's Liber florum John's Liber jlorum celestis doctrine, or portions of it, is witnessed in nineteen known manuscripts, preserving two authorial versions as well as two later re­dactions, and a variety of extracts from John's prayers that have been put to other uses.9 It is the two authorial drafts that concern me here. John's first version, which he calls the \"Old Compilation'' (Antiqua Compila­tio ), was written in the first decade of the fourteenth century and completed by 1311. The second version, from which all the other known forms of the text de­rive and which John calls the \"New Compilation'' (Nova Compilatio ), was begun"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 195 and completed in 1315. Both versions have three main parts: part I, \"The Book of Visions;' which contains the narrative of the visions and events leading up to John's construction of the prayer text; part II, \"The Book of Prayers\" and \"First Procedure;' containing prayers and ritual instructions, respectively, that allow the purification of the soul and the reception ofknowledge from the angels, and a set of separate instructions for their use; and part III, \"The Book of Figures; describing a set of images or figures intended for use with the book of prayers. In the New Compilation, the first three parts of the work remain substantially the same as those of the Old (aside from minor revisions), but the New Compi­lation \"Book of Figures\" is a completely different work from the Old. The Old Compilation also includes some matter at the end of part I.iv, also pertaining to figures, that is missing from the New.10 By John's account, \"The Book of Figures\" of the New Compilation was put together in response to some criticisms of the Old Compilation text from certain unnamed \"barking dogs\" at Sens in 1315.U The \"barking dogs\" complained that the original figures of the Old Compilation looked too much like necromantic figures; there were some theological complaints about the prayer system as wel1.12 John did not believe that the figures of the Old Compilation were in any way theologically questionable; nevertheless, in part as a response to the criticism (so it seems), John decided to revise the parts of the book in which the figures were contained, cutting down an originally much larger number of figures to seven icons of the Virgin, surrounded by symbolic birds and plants, and one image of Christ, with iconography drawn from the apocalypse. A unique copy of the Old Compilation is now known in a Bodleian Library manuscript, Liturg. 160. This copy of the Old Compilation, in fact, contains only two actual figures: on folio 66r, a star-shaped figure that accompanies (and con­tains) a prayer to the Virgin (see fig. 4), and on folio u, a circular figure contain­ing the four letters of the divine name in Latin transliteration (IHWH)13 with other mnemonic letters surrounding them, which are explained by the prayer that goes with this figure (see fig. s). However, the material at the end of part I.i v describes twenty-six images in detail sufficient for their re-creation (twelve fig­ures of the twelve houses, seven planetary figures and seven images of the Vir­gin), and book III includes instructions for lettering on sixty to seventy more, from which we can extrapolate that the original book probably held in the neigh­borhood of ninety figures (more or less, not counting overlap or additional un­lettered figures).14 Other references to the figures suggest that most (but not all) of them contained crosses, and that geometric patterns were present in many of them.15 We know, too, from John's instructions, that every figure was supposed to contain one Hebrew letter of the tetragrammaton placed in each corner of the page. An exemplar copy of the tetragrammaton in Hebrew is included in the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"196 INVOKING ANGELS Fig. 4 Figure from John of Morigny's Old Compilation, Liturg. 160, fo l. 66r, Bodleian Li­brary, University of Oxford"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME Fig. 5 Another figure from Liturg. 160, fo l. 1r, Bodleian Library, University of Oxford"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"198 INVOKING ANGELS Old Compilation text as represented by the Bodleian manuscript. 16 There is also a set of complete Hebrew and Greek alphabets at the end. Many changes were made to the entire operating procedure in the New Com­pilation \"Book of Figures.\" Not only did John cut down the total number of fig­ures radically, but a number of other rules for their operation were simplified As well, in the New Compilation, all Hebrew is dropped from the figures-not because these were evidently a target of criticism by the \"barking dogs\" but rather because, as noted earlier, John was divinely instructed that the fo ur letters of the divine name in the figures should be replaced with the nails of the cruci­fixion. In addition, the letters JHWH drop out of the circular figure with which the Bodleian book opens. In fact, the figure is not represented in the New Com­pilation as such; instead, the operator of the New Compilation is directed to imagine a simple circle in place of the complex pattern of letters (see fig. 5) that once stood there at the introit to the whole work. The New Compilation \"Book of Figures\" contains a description of two vi­sions of particular importance here. In the first of these visions, John is divinely instructed about the new figures; in the second, he receives instruction about a ring dedicated to Mary to be worn during certain operations of the work. The first, and more elaborate, vision begins with a description of John, after spiritual struggles, finding himself in an ecstatic dream flying over many valleys and towns before landing at the entrance to a church. John kneels before the closed doors; an entrance appears and he goes in: And behold! believing that I was, as it were, in Paradise because of the parcel gilding of the church all around, I came before an altar that had been made in honor of the crucified one. And there was an image of the crucified and of Nicodemus, and of another person who was removing the crucified one from the cross, with one nail already pulled out from the right hand. And remaining there, knees bent, I asked if I might confirm the new instructions of this book and the figures that had to be made and the ring. And inclining my left ear to his mouth so that I could hear his answer, behold! suddenly the image of the crucified one was transformed into the likeness and fo rm of a certain elderly man whom I declared and believed to be God the Father.17 John requests confirmation of his work and the divine authorization to make the new figures and the ring, which is given. He then asks advice on what the figures should look like, and God says: \"You will make in the same place in each of them an image of the blessed Mary in the best way you can. This does not relate to an excessive care fo r the pictures or the colors, but to the excessive care"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 199 for the cleansing of heart and conscience from sins and vices with which you ought to paint these images of the glorious Virgin ... on the heart of the con­science, and use for adornment the colors of the virtues and the ornaments of penances, and do it as well as you can:'18 John goes on to gloss these words in a parenthetical comment in the text, seeing the directive to do it \"in the best way you can\" as God's concession to human frailty, since the heart can never be clean enough to hold the Virgin's image. John adds that the same thing should be un­derstood as true of the ring and the book; the ring \"similarly should be sculpted in the metal of the heart and worn on the finger of conscience; as also this book must be written on the parchment of the heart and read in the lettering of conscience-though just the same it should be written out by hand, as is made plain in the penultimate chapter of this book:'19 This passage evokes the complex of biblical references depicting God's new law and covenant as a \"writing on the heart.\" The new law is prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31-34 as a law that will be given to the viscera and written on the heart of God's people; the new law as a writing on the heart is evoked again in the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews 8:10 (\"dando leges meas in mentem eorum, et in corde eorum superscribam eas\"), and similarly as a writing on the mind in Hebrews 10:16 (\"dando leges meas in cordibus eorum, et in mentibus eorum superscribam eas\"). Through this refer­ence to the inscription on the heart, John implicitly conveys how the book, ring, and figures of the New Compilation are symbolic of God's covenant with John and John's successors, those who will use the book after him. God gives further instructions about the images: \"You will make in the same place in each of them one image of the blessed Mary in the best way you can .... And in the corners of the same figures make a figure in each corner in the fo rm of a nail.\" I said to him: \"Lord, you have told me that I can make in each figure one image of the blessed Mary ... and in the corner of each figure, a figure of a nail:' In answer, he said: \"Yes, that's right:' I said to him: '�nd do you thus want me to make there in the corners the name of the Lord, Tetragrammaton ?\" And he said to me: \"Not now:' [Or: \"Not anymore:' (Non iam.)]2° Thus, in the images John is now instructed to make here, the fo ur letters of the divine name are replaced by the fo ur nails associated with the Passion of Christ. In the second, shorter vision of the archangel Michael, which is closely con­tiguous with this, John is instructed in the making of the ring, where, similarly, the important central feature of the design is an image of the Virgin. When John"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"200 INVOKING ANGELS asks if he should write names of God around the image, he is told not to; but he may, if he wishes, put the name of the Virgin on it.21 John explains these two cancellations of the divine name in a later passage: Since it was divinely said to us that the name of the Lord is not to be placed in these figures or in the ring, it must be seen why this was said and instructed. Certainly it was rightly said for this reason: so that we do not seem to be Judaizing in any respect, but that Christ may always be seen in word and deed, confessed true God and man. Because in olden times in the Old Testament, God never took on any shape, and therefore the Jews themselves applied no shape to God, and on that account it was forbidden to them to make images in the Mosaic law. But in place of images, they used the names of that same God, which are ten in the Hebrew speech. :u But because Christ assumed human form, so it is necessary further to con­fess him not only as true God, by his name, but also as true man, by the image of the human form he assumed. And because in these figures [i.e., John's own figures, with Jesus in the Virgin's arms] the form of humanity that the selfsame God assumed is depicted, under which [form]lies hid the selfsame perfect divinity, as we firmly believe, it was not necessary to set thereon the name of God, because it is contained beneath the image.23 In John's thinking, as expressed here, the written letters of the tetragrammaton continue to be associated with the \"selfsame perfect divinity\" of God-it is a form of God in the world, the only form allowed prior to the incarnation. But since the new form of God in the world (the flesh and its image) subsumes the old (the written letters of the name), it is more appropriate for John now, in his \"Book of Figures;' to incorporate that new form that the Old Law expressly pro­hibited. The old form (the written name) is not revoked but is said to be con­tained beneath the image of the human form, the body of Jesus. Interestingly, in this vision, the person of the Trinity who explicates the suppression (or super­session) of the divine name in John's images is the Father, who steps out (as it were) of the skin of the crucified one, depicted in the very process of the removal of the nails that held him there, to authorize the displacement of those letters by these nails. So the God of the Old Testament is envisioned as tucked beneath the skin of the Son, just as the letters of the name also are contained beneath the iconic and symbolic flesh of Jesus. In relation to the exegesis of John's work, the idea of covenant cuts in several directions at once. Most important, it works to justify the historical necessity of all portions of the earlier, now superseded, Old Compilation text. John says that his Old Compilation prefigures the New just as the Old Testament prefigures the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 201 New.24 Elsewhere, he comments that the Old Compilation is not revoked but must be kept and guarded: It must be noted that the visions of this science have one resonance in the literal sense and signify something else mysteriously according to the al­legorical sense. And therefore we do not now revoke the Old Compilation, or only the figures and the forms and instructions fo r the petitions, but not the visions and prophecies; nay, rather we exhort everyone to keep and look after the entire Old Compilation, because in it are the principles of this knowledge, that from which it proceeded, and why and how it was revealed, and what is to come concerning the church is contained in it.25 In essence, John seems to want to enjoin the laying aside of the ceremonialia of his Old Compilation while keeping the moral principles and prophetic content, and to continue to understand the entire book, in both old and new fo rms, as holy. This is consistent not only with the theology of covenant, as he expresses it in his gloss on the vision, but also with John's attitude, expressed elsewhere, toward his own life and work: John reads everything that happens to him as providential and as tending toward a redemptive conclusion, even his pain and suffering, even the mockery he suffers as the Old Compilation is criticized. To what extent does this mean that John was aware of himself as following a Jewish precedent in the Old Compilation text? On the one hand, he clearly understands the name magic by which angels are conjured as a Jewish practice, and he is certainly, at least to some extent, aware of himself as following in this tradition. This is evident from other aspects of lettering on the figures and the inclusion of actual Hebrew letters in the old book, as well as from what he says about Judaizing in connection with this vision. At this point in the text, how­ever, John's worry over Judaizing is part of a larger set of concerns, and I would suggest that it is not solely or even mainly dictated by a perception of himself as in error. 26 It may be important to recall that there is no indication anywhere in the work that a suggestion of Judaizing formed any part of the charge against the work by the \"dogs\" at Sens. We can also see that John has a strong psychological motivation to adapt an old and new covenant model of his work-first, because of his sincere perception that the original \"Book of Figures\" was divinely ap­proved, but also, and at the same time, because he wants to make clear that the ceremonies of the second \"Book of Figures\" are the ones his successors really should be using, even though both versions of the text are divinely countenanced. John sets his own work in the context of the new law in order simultaneously to instruct his followers in which \"Book of Figures\" to use and to identify the ori­gins and goals of both works as holy and dependent upon each other fo r their"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"202 INVOKING ANGELS meaning. He probably did understand himself as following a Jewish precedent in his operations, but probably not in a very much different or worse way than all Christians do in their common reception of the Old Testament. What is at issue for John with the Old Compilation is not the intrinsic holiness of the He­brew inspiration behind his original document but how it should now be read. 2. Ideas of Judaism in the Liber iuratus Thanks to Jan Veenstra's chapter in this volume, which describes the text con­tained in Berengaria Ganell's Summa sacre magice, it is now clear that the Sworn Book existed in two versions, an earlier version probably originating in Spain, which is retained in the Summa sacre magice, and a later version probably re­dacted in a more northerly location and preserved in a handful of British Library manuscripts (referred to herein as the London version). Mesler has discussed the considerations pertinent to the texts' dating in her chapter in this volume; they may be summed up by noting that the current body of evidence increasingly sug­gests that both texts are most probably products of the first half of the fourteenth century. For reasons of cultural context, Veenstra proposes that the earlier Ganell text may be contemporary with the later life of Ramon Uull {d. 1316), though a date in the thirteenth century remains possible. The London version was put to­gether from a sketchy and incomplete copy of the text used by Ganell, and a date in the 1320s or 1330s remains plausible for this redaction. While the provenance of this text's composition remains uncertain, it is clear that it had to pass through France on its way to becoming the version now known in the manuscripts pre­served in the British Library and edited by Hedegard, and that it did not linger long in the making (since it arrives in an English manuscript quite soon after the plausible composition dates). Thus it is likely that the text was put together some­where in France, though England cannot be ruled out. While both versions of this Christian text draw on Islamic and Jewish sources, Veenstra notes that Ganell's version is marked more by a tendency toward anti­Islamic rhetoric, while the later London version is less so, and has to some extent displaced this with anti-Jewish rhetoric. Keeping a broad focus on all we know about both texts, there are good reasons (aside from the ready availability of Hedegard's edition) for treating the London version of the Sworn Book in paral­lel with John of Morigny's Liber florum. The London version was redacted most probably in France, most probably within a decade or so of the year John's book was burned in Paris. Thus, while they are not precisely contemporary composi­tions, their authors inhabited a broadly similar cultural context and exhibited a similar set of preoccupations, including their willingness to confess a relation to"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 203 an idea of magic, their ready access to and use of the glossed Ars notoria, and the particular fo rm of their self-consciousness about their Jewish precedents, which also includes an interest in models of supersession of covenant. Richard Kieckhefer noted in \"The Devil's Contemplatives\" that the Sworn Book states explicitly that Jewish magi cannot attain true visions or true answers from angels. What is of interest is that the passage debarring Jews from attaining true visions concerns supersession: The Jews work with this vision not at all, because through the advent of Christ they lost their gift and cannot be stationed in heaven as the Lord witnesses who says \"who is baptized will not be condemned:'27 And so they work imperfectly with all the angels. And they cannot get an effect through invocations unless they put faith in Christ, because this was said through the Prophet: \"When the king of kings and lord of lords comes, your unction shall cease;' which never would have ceased if they should }tave a true effect through this art, and thus their works are null. And al­though the Jews, inasmuch as they are Jews, are condemned by God, yet they do worship the most high creator, but in undue manner. Neverthe­less, they can coerce spirits to come by the power of holy names of God, but because the Jews are not marked with the sign of the lord, namely, of the cross and of the faith, the spirits are not willing to answer them truly. 28 As in John ofMorigny's work, the use of God-names to command angels is un­derstood to be an original Jewish power; but with the coming of Christ, the Jews lost their gift (donum). This term denotes more than one layer of things but evi­dently here includes both eligibility for divine election (the ability to get into heaven) and the ability perfectly to work with angels (a power contingent on election in the terms of the passage). Now, while the Jews retain the power to command angels, they are nevertheless denied the ability to have a veridical vi­sion from the angelic operation. In essence, Jews have the power, but they lack the insight to use the ceremonies of this text. To further unpack the connection between Judaism and the inability to get true information from angels, we need to look at the context of the second quo­tation, \"your unction shall cease:' ascribed here simply to \"the Prophet:' Dating from sometime in the sixth century, a prophecy in a similar form was widely attributed to the book of Daniel: \"cum venerit sanctum sanctorum, cessabit unctio vestra.\"29 However, although the book of Daniel does contain a messianic prophecy, neither this quotation nor its underlying idea is present there.30 The original (or at least earliest known) source of the quotation appears to have been a pseudo-Augustinian sermon, '1\\.gainst the Jews, Pagans, and Arians:' In that work,"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"204 INVOKING ANGELS the pseudo-Daniel quotation is brought in as part of an extended refutation of Jewish denial from various prophetic passages in the Old Testament, including Isaiah, Baruch, (genuine) Daniel, Deuteronomy, and Psalms (and indeed intro­ducing testimony from Virgil's fourth Eclogue, the Sibylline oracles, heaven, hell, the land, and the sea). The passage incorporating the pseudo-Daniel quotation continues: \"Why with him [now] present, to whom insulting you used to say: 'you of yourself speak testimony, your testimony is not true' (John 8:13), has your unction ceased, except that he himself is the Holy of Holies who has come? ... if, as is true, your unction has ceased, acknowledge that the Holy of Holies has come:'31 With this sermon, the pseudo-Daniel quotation becomes incorporated into the body of Old Testament topoi prophesying the coming of Christ and si­multaneously becomes a topos for the passing oflaw and covenant and salvation­bearing sacraments into the hands of the Christians. Despite the fact that it is not really scriptural, it becomes a source fo r the idea that the Jews themselves are unable to read their own scriptures or indeed to understand the import of the actual evidence of prophetic fulfillment written into them and now carried out by historical events. The master of the Sworn Book has adopted this idea, and indeed has taken it one step further, for according to him, the unction of the Jews never would have ceased if they were able to obtain a true effect from this art: in other words, to paraphrase what appears to be the underlying circular logic, it cannot be pos­sible for a Jew to obtain a true vi sion through the angelic operations of the Sworn Book; if it were, this would me an that an unconverted Jew could be among the elect. In essence, this not only debars the Jew from using the book but also puts the Sworn Book itself on the level of a Christian sacrament (the argument for denying a Jew who hypothetically wished to participate in the Eucharist would be essentially the same: it could not have a true effect for someone who was not a Christian). By corollary, the only way for a Jew to participate in the mystery of the Sworn Book and obtain true answers from angels would be through baptism. When the master of the Sworn Book says that the angels will not answer the Jews truly because they are not \"marked with the sign of the Lord\" (non signantur signo domini), he refers to the character of baptism, the sacrament of Christian initiation that marks the Christian with the invisible and spiritual sign of faith, understood within the context of supersession to replace the visible and literal mark of circumcision. Baptism removes the disabling Jewish blindness, enabling angelic invocations through holy names of God (a practice known to be Jewish, but here, like the Old Testament itself, appropriated fo r Christianity) to reveal true knowledge. The conception of Jews as unable to understand their own history or read their own scriptures is here linked to a broad stereotype ofJewish spiritual blind-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 205 ness. Its outlines are dearly evident already in the pseudo-Augustinian sermon that is the pseudo-Honorius's source, but many different types of texts in the later Middle Ages delineate similar sets of associations within a nonliturgical, non­magical context. Where issues of signs and true reading or seeing emerge, there tend to be associations with Jews; conversely, where Jews and Christians come together, issues of signs, reading, and vision emerge. To offer two examples from quite different genres, Book II of John of Salisbury's Policraticus is -an extended meditation on signs. It contains, after a general discussion of omens, a treatment of the blindness of the Jews to omens and prophecies about the destruction of Je­rusalem, consisting of stories (drawn from Josephus) of various omens, portents, prodigies, and visions forecasting Jews' downfall for their failure to receive Christ. This refutation of the Jews is fo llowed closely by a discussion of dreams, auguries, astrological events, and their significance, again on a more generalleveJ.32 Another compelling but very different kind of instance, dwelling on issues of vision and blindness, is the twelfth-century autobiographical narrative of the Jew­ish apostate Hermann-Judah. Here, as in the John of Salisbury text, visions and omens are represented as forms of spiritual knowledge, parallel to scripture, whose real meaning is not expected to inhere in the literal or material level of the signifier and is unavailable to the unbaptized. However, in this story the paradigms of spiri­tual blindness are intimately tied to transforming incidents in the autobiography. Hermann's conversion to Christianity is framed by the two readings of a vision {the \"false\" Jewish reading and the \"true\" Christian one) that he had at age thir­teen. His conversion, described from the vantage of a time much later in his life, is explained not only through the Christian topos of God's desire to call back a sinner \"that he may be converted and live;' but also simultaneously by the failure of his own Jewish community to grasp the correct sense of this prognostic dream, which was read by the Jewish interpreters as pertaining to material prosperity rather than {as only Christianity understood) heavenly treasure. Hermann also has a notable difficulty in gazing upon a crucifixion icon in the cathedral, where, conditioned by Jewish responses, he experiences both fascination and repulsion. The tension this icon generates in him is eased {in the story) by the theological discourse of Rupert of Deutz, which effects the beginning of his conversion by enabling him to see the spiritual meaning of the visual image of God. 33 If indeed this is the personal history of a real Jewish apostate, then it is possible, as Jeremy Cohen suggests, that Hermann-Judah appropriates a Christian identity and uses the derogatory stereotypes of Jewish blindness that go along with it to cast asper­sions on his family and members of a home community with whom {as the narra­tive suggests on a deeper level) he had not been getting along well to start with.34 Whether or not Hermann's story represents genuine autobiography, it is of interest, however, that a Christian icon, used to frame an essential distinction"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"206 INVOKING ANGELS from aniconic Judaism, comes into play as a turning point in the autobiographic narrative of John of Morigny as well, even though John was dearly not a Jewish convert. John's moment of transition between the Old and New Compilation texts is framed, in the vision where the instructions fo r the New Compilation \"Book of Figures\" are first received, as a transition from a Jewish representation of God to a Christian one. In a sense, John refashions himself at that moment as someone who had once behaved as a Jew in order to represent the transcending of his earlier self(the composer of the Old Compilation) and to redeem the en­tire text as a source of divine knowledge. Looked at another way, at this point in John's autobiography it is not simply a question of converting from the life of the lost sinner to the life of the saved penitent (this seems to be the conversion model fo r Hermann-Judah), but rather a question of conversion from one deeply experienced fo rm of holiness to another, for which the transit between cove­nants is a more fitting model. John is thus able to preserve and indeed enhance an idea of the s�cramental and salvific aspects of his practice while preserving a sense of himself as having undergone a profound conversion experience. So deeply is an idea of Judaism engaged with Christian identity that the paradigms of the Christian understanding of Judaism get attached to, and are used to char­acterize and explain, other things that may not have directly to do with real Jews at all. Let us step back and reconsider the points of comparison and difference be­tween both texts. Both the Liber iuratus and the Liber florum understand the use of the divine name as a specifically Jewish power that needs to be overwritten, in the case of the Liber visionum with the image of Christ's body and the fo ur nails of the Passion, in the case of the Sworn Book with the sacrament of baptism; both authors are trying to establish their own operations firmly on a new cove­nant footing. At the same time, both authors are operating in certain ways quite diffe rently around the notion of supersession: John's first desire is to retain the original sanctity of his own first \"Book of Figures;' despite the fa ct that he is no longer using (or advocating the use of) the old figures or the divine name on the new figures, whereas the master of the Sworn Book simply desires to establish the genuine divine status of the Sworn Book over and against the Jewish and Is­lamic operations he is conscious of plundering. It is unsurprising that the authors of two new theurgic texts of the early fo ur­teenth century, both preoccupied with cleansing of the soul, divine illumination, and their own sacramental status, should also be occupied with supersession. After all, issues of supersession arise in the Christian theological literature wher­ever the sacraments are discussed. It is true that both John of Morigny and the master of the Sworn Book also draw on a corpus of available medieval magic"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"COVENANT AND THE DIVINE NAME 207 texts that, for some time, had been absorbing material from Islamic and Jewish traditions; however, it may be that this is not the only thing-or even the most important thing-that gives these Christian texts their Jewish \"look:' In the opening pages of his Jewish Magic and Superstition, Joshua Trachten­berg mentions in passing another late medieval Christian theurgic text, the Ars notoria (discussed by Julien Veronese in chapter 1 of this volume), which was an important influence on John of Morigny and whose prayers were also adopted, in part, into the London version of the Sworn Book. Trachtenberg argues that it was in the Geonic age, under the influence of Gnosticism, that a truly Jewish magic began to arise for the first time, evolving into a theurgy that \"blossomed luxuriantly in the Germanic lands\" in the later Middle Ages. Describing the basic characteristics of this quintessentially Jewish magic, Trachtenberg notes that \"for all its more or less assimilated foreign elements, and its general similar­ity to the Gnostic-Jewish system imperfectly known to non-Jews as the Ars no­toria, it remained distinctive in its basic emphases:'35 Here Trachtenberg seems to hold up the Ars notoria as a perhaps debased but still more or less accurate schematic model of the kind of thing that real Jewish magic usually looks like when it is at home (even while he confesses that the Ars notoria itself is non­Jewish, and also that the truly \"Jewish\" magic contains some assimilated foreign elements). One cannot help but wonder what it means when a Christian text looks Jewish under this particular concatenation of circumstances. In the concluding chapter of his work on the feminine divine, Mirror of His Beauty, Peter Schafer struggles to explain the parallels he discovers between the Christian veneration of Mary and the bahiric image of the Shekhinah, both de­veloping in Provence in the twelfth century. As a possible alternative to the ex­planation of these parallel ideas through a search for direct religious borrowings (always frustrated by the fact that the response of both religions to each other's practices tend to be voiced in negative and derogatory terms), Schafer suggests thinking in terms of an \"anxiety of influence\" model, drawn from Harold Bloom. In this model we can look for influence not just in acknowledged homage or direct textual borrowings but also in more complicated acts of response and creative interpretation, which Bloom calls \"misprision:· Schafer elaborates on the relation of this model to historical circumstances: \"As in the poetic theory, the recipient actively digests the transmitted tradition, transforms it, and creates something new. Similarly, the act of re-creation is tantamount to 'killing' the transmitted; thus the inevitable feeling of anxiety toward the 'source' that is transformed and recreated, the ambivalence of attraction and repulsion:'36 1 would like to suggest that a similar way of thinking may be applicable here. It is at least useful to ask whether the Jewish look, hinted at by the Ars notoria and still more evidently present in the cognate practices of the Liber florum and"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"208 INVOKING ANGELS the Liber iuratus, may be the result of a tension between Jewish name magic and Christian theurgy that pulls in both directions. The sense expressed by Kieckhe­fer that John of Morigny's work relies on Judaism for a \"fundamental conception of spiritual process\" may go back to a framing of Christian identity as originally deriving from Judaism, and now, once again, needing to overwrite the claims of Judaism. In this light, it may need to be asked whether Jewish theurgy, blossom­ing in the same time period as the Christian texts under discussion, may not simply be an unacknowledged and repudiated source for Christian borrowing but potentially, in some instances, a response to it. It seems clear from the evi­dence provided by these texts, in any case, that Christians define themselves in this period by relation to an idea of Jews whose sacramental ideas and practices remain in competition with Christian ones-practices perhaps the more needing to be repudiated (or transcended, or appropriated and overwritten by Christian signatures) the more they seem likely to be effective.

Lack of a comprehensive survey of magic in manuscript as well as lack of edited texts in both traditions remains a problem. Our knowledge of the Latin magical traditions has been greatly en­hanced with the recent work by Jean-Patrice Boudet, Entre science et nigromance: A.strologie, divination et magie dansl'Occident medievale (Xlle-XVe siecle) (Paris: Publications de Ia Sorbonne, 2006), but work remains to be done, in particular in exploring the crossover between Hebrew and Latin magical traditions. We may speculate that both john and the compiler of the Sworn Book had access to por­tions of the book transmitted in Latin as the Liber Razielis (discussed in Page's chapter in this volume), which contained diagrams like the tabula semamphoras, wh ich made use of the divine name (see the figure reproduced in Veenstra's chapter in this volume). John does mention a Liber Semhemfo ras in a list ofbooks comprising the discipline of geonegia in the Old Compilation \"Book of Figures\" (Bodleian Library, fol. 63r). A Liber Semiforas traveled as a portion of the Latin Liber Raziclis. 9. See appendices for a digest of version and manuscript information. 10.

'Ihe attack on the figures is described in section III.i.1 of our edition (beginning on fol. 71V2 in London, British Library, Additional18027). John defends himself from other charges against the the­ology of the text in III.iii.6 (fol. 86r2ff.). These charges may or may not have been leveled by the same authorities who carped against the figures; John does not specify. They charge, in language derived from Gratian, that John's prayers involve idolatry and demonic pact. In similar language, John replies that he has made no demonic pact but rather that dhine covenant operates in the work."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"214 INVOKING ANGELS 13. Actually spelled, in the figure, I He W Ht. It was a not uncommon medieval Latin practice to read the last letter of the name as heth rather than he. Throughout John's work, wherever they are writ­ten out, the letters are spelled joth he vau heth. A search of the Patrologia Latina yields many instances of similar errors. 14. From internal references, it seems probable that all of the figures were originally contained in two discrete quires, one at the end of section I.iv and one at the end of\"The Book of Figures\" (part III). 15. Discussion of crosses and geometric figures comes in our section lll.n; in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Liturg. 160, this starts at the bottom of fol. 57V and continues on 58r. 16. The second letter of the name is missing a downstroke, making it look more like a da/et than a he. As Mesler comments (note 31 in chapter 3, concerning the dalet error in the London version of the Sworn Book), a Jewish scribe might make such an omission intentionally in order to avoid fully writing out the tetragranirnaton. John dates the composition of\"The Book of Figures\" to 1308; where he may have fo und Jewish scribes in France to help him with his Hebrew so soon after the expulsion of 1306 is a puzzle. However, assuming that this transcription derives from John's exemplar, his initial experi­ments with the divine name may in fact date to an earlier period, when there was still a Jewish com­munity at Chartres. At one point John mentions a quarrel with some Jews, in which the Virgin tells him that he will be victorious (Bodleian Library, Liturg. 160, fol. 66v). 17. \"Et ecce! credens quasi essem in paradyso propter deauracionem ipsius ecclesie in circuitu partelum, veni ante altare quod erat constructum in honore crucifixi.

The Patrologia Latina yields occurrences beginning with Gregory the Great and becoming more frequent as time goes on. For samples, see Gregory the Great's Commentary on 1 Kings (PL 79.461C); a commentary on the Psalms by a pseudo-Bede (PL 93.876A), and, perhaps fo llowing him, one by Walafrid Strabo (PL 113.96oC). There are several occurrences in the works ofHaymo of Hal­berstadt, including his homily on the holy innocents (PL u8.82D), and in Peter Damian, passim, in­cluding his sermon on the Lord's epiphany (PL 144·513C). Later instances become too numerous to itemize. 30. In edited texts where this quotation occurs (such as the pseudo-Augustinian sermon under discussion), the quotation is often attributed, without comment, to Daniel9.2.4, where the coming of the Holy ofHolies is mentioned. However, the vulgate actually reads, \"deleatur iniquitas et adducatur iustitia sempiterna, et impleatur visio et prophetia, et ungatur Sanctus sanctorum\" (quoted from Bi­blia sacra iuxta vulgatam Clementinam, ed. A. Colunga and L. Turrada, 8th ed. [Madrid: Biblioteca de autores Christianos, 1985] ).

A philosopher and physician, Antonio da Montolmo wrote a gloss on a Hermetic opuscule on astrological seals and a treatise called Occult and Manifest Things (De occultis et manifestis). Antonio uses the word \"magic\" in a precise and specific sense; in his usage, a magical work or magic art (opus magicum, ars magica) refers mainly to actions with spirits, whereas actions or procedures based on occult influences or astrology are never called magic (with fe w exceptions, as in chapter 4, §9). In what follows, I try to respect Antonio da Montolmo's own habitual use of the term. I wholeheartedly thank Julien Veronese, who gave me his own transcription of the Latin text of chap­ters 4-6 of De occultis et manifestis (based on my previous incomplete draft), which was very helpful to me; and who did all the identifications of the quotations from the Almada/ (Aimandel) and Cla­vicula Salomonis-manuscripts about which he is very knowledgeable. I am indebted to him for the remarks, analysis, and quotations concerning these texts in the Amsterdam manuscript B.P.H. 114 and the Vatican manuscript, Vat. lat. 3180; see notes on the translation: 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 24, 35, 37, 55, 6o, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73. I am also indebted to him for the information in note 65 on the names of God and Moses. I also wish to thank Claire Fanger, who read the chapter with particular relevance and accuracy: she corrected the English translation, always with an eye to the Latin text, and gave many suggestions to improve the interpretation. I am grateful also to Azelina Jaboulet-Vercherre and Frederic Ferro who kindly re-read my English; to Jean-Patrice Boudet and Jean-Marc Mandosio for their useful suggestions on certain obscure sections of Antonio's text, and to Irene Caiazzo for her specific advice concerning the edition."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"2 20 INVOKING ANGELS 1. Antonio da Montolmo: A Physician, Astrologer, and Magician Few facts are known about Antonio's life. In 1360 he was a lecturer on grammar at the University of Bologna, where he taught medicine and astrology from I387 to 1392. Then we find him teaching philosophy and medicine in Padua in 1393. A year later he was teaching in Mantua. His astrological work De iudiciis nativi­tatum liber praeclarissimus, completed in Mantua, was annotated by Regiomon­tanus and edited in 1540.1 Antonio's two short works on magic have never been published and are ex­tant only in manuscripts. The fifteenth -century Italian manuscript of the Biblio­theque nationale de France, lat. 7337, contains the De occultis et manifestis and the Glosa super ymagines duodecim signorum Hermetis (Gloss on the images of the twelve signs of Hermes). Another manuscript, held in the Bibliotheca Apos­tolica Vaticana, Vat. lat. 4085, contains the Glosa but without an author's name (generally the content of this latter manuscript shares many texts with the for­mer one).2 Although Lynn Thorndike noted Antonio's contribution to the his­tory of Western magic in his History of Magic and Experimental Science, little subsequent scholarship has been dedicated to this magician? Antonio alludes several times to his De occultis et manifestis in his Glosa on the images of the twelve signs of Hermes-the latter being a Hermetic text on twelve medical seals that must be made under the twelve zodiacal signs. This text, which bears several titles, such as Liber fo rmarum (elsewhere I have given it the more descriptive title De duodecim imaginibus Hermetis),4 appeared for the first time, as far as we know, in the Jewish milieu of Montpellier at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The first Christian to cite the text was Arnold of Villa­nova. Arnold also made use of a short text especially dedicated to the seal of the lion (I call it Lion I), which belongs to another tradition but is very often associ­ated with the Liber fo rmarum in manuscripts. Generally, the name of Arnold of Villanova is cited in manuscripts at the place where the section borrowed from Lion I occurs.5 In one of these manuscripts, the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vat. lat. 4082 (Padova, 1401), Antonio da Montolmo's name also occurs: after the text of Lion I (which is inserted in the section dealing with the seal of Leo of the Liber fo rmarum), we read, \"The same is done fo r the diseases of the other limbs in concordance with the fo rm of the planets and according to the process and doctrine of Arnold of Villanova. Antonio da Montolmo astrologer:'6 Antonio seems to be the author of this interpolation. The Liber fo rmarum and Lion I are perhaps among the very few Hermetic talismanic texts deprived of rituals, char­acters, and other signs, whether directly or implicitly addressed to a spirit. I have called this kind of magic with such signs \"addressative magic:' and the Liber fo rmarum is thus a nonaddressative magical text? In the mid-thirteenth century,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTlS ET MANIFESTIS 221 the anonymous author of the Speculum astronomiae coined the notion of \"astro­logical image'' in order to define a talisman (an artificial magical object) that would derive its power not from the spirits but only from the natural power of the stars. Condemning many Hermetic talismanic texts as \"abominable\" and Solomonic texts as \"detestable;' the Magister Speculi managed to save only one nonaddressative text presenting \"images purely astrological,\" the De imaginibus ascribed to 1hebit (i.e., 1habit ibn Qurra). He may also include in this category (but with less certainty) the Opus imaginum of the pseudo-Ptolemy.8 Obviously, the Liber formarum and Lion I, if they had been known by the author of the Specu­lum astronomiae, could have fit within the category of \"astrological image:' And this is an exceptional situation, since almost all image magic texts were indeed addressative; the idea of a \"purely astrological image\" was, like that of \"natural magic;' an intellectual illusion, that of a magic theologically and scientifically acceptable. Nevertheless, Antonio da Montolmo, in his gloss, introduces ad­dressative elements in order to make the Hermetic text more efficient. In doing so, he witnesses a change in the history of Western magic: he foreshadows the mutation of the quattrocento, a century in which, in a kind of\"liberation of the magical word;' the \"author-magician\" appears. 2. The First '1\\uthor-Magician\"? I have suggested elsewhere the idea that in the Middle Ages a magical text could not have a real author.91he reasons for this were both logical and theological. By logical reasons I mean that since the rituals, invocations, and signs in magical texts or recipes were not supposed to be mere human inventions, they needed to be ascribed to traditions based on ancient mythical authorities (Hermes, Solo­mon, Apollonius, Abel) who had received these truths through divine revela­tion. 1hrough this chain of knowledge, the rituals fo und their justification in the divine order itself. Such a situation is suggested, fo r instance, in the prologue of the Liber lunae, where Abel and other ancient sages had their knowledge en­graved in the marble; after the Flood, Hermes Trismegistus fo und these writings in Ebron.1° Certainly, several magical texts full of rituals were ascribed posthu­mously to such medieval authors as Albert the Great and Arnold of Villanova, but these apocryphal attributions were made possible precisely by the fa me of their supposed authors, who had become legendary. 1he theological reasons are even more obvious: no medieval author could assume authorship fo r a text describing magical processes or supporting \"ad­dressative'' magic. 1he Liber iuratus, which advocates a positivized idea of magic against the antimagicallaws of Pope John XXII, bears the name of Honorius of"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"22.2. INVOKING ANGELS Thebes.n That the astrologer Cecco d'Ascoli dared to write many sections deal­ing with astrological nigromancy in his commentary on the Sp here of Sacro­bosco seems to be the main reason for his sentence to the stake by the Florentine Inquisition in 1327. (The Summa sacre magice, written by the Catalan Berengaria Ganell in 1343, seems veryexceptional.)12 But Antonio da Montolmo seems to be one of the very first to overcome this double impossibility. Concerning the logical impossibility, he manages to retain the status of author through his Glosa super ymagines duodecim signorum Her­metis and through his intellectual speculation on magical sources in De occultis et manifestis. Later, another author, Giorgio Anselmi da Parma, assumed the status of author-magician as a compiler of magical sources in his De magia disciplina. By his assuming authorship of a magical text, Antonio foreshadows the great era of magician-philosophers like Marsilio Ficino and Henricus Cornelius Agrippa. Concerning the theological impossibility, Antonio himself seems to go even further than Cecco in his description and theorization of the astrological nigro­mancy, but the context was no longer the same. The quattrocento was a period in which magical discourse became freer than it had been before, especially in and around Florence. Certainly, the author-magicians of the century did not forget the theological risk: thus, as can be seen in the debate on \"astrological images;' their alleged \"natural magic\" seems often to have been mere lip service paid in order to avoid problems with the church. This motivation probably also lies behind the evidently hypocritical non tam probo quam narro (I do not ap­prove as much as I relate), repeated several times by Marsilio Ficino in his De vita when dealing with astrological magic.13 As we will see, Antonio makes many remarks in order to protect himself from theological censure. 3. Occult and Manifest Sources fo r the De occultis et manifestis First, Antonio da Montolmo borrows from standard sources of the arts curricu­lum. Aristotle's Ethics14 gives him a general statement about knowledge; and An­tonio makes use of the Aristotelian treatise On the Soul twice when discussing theories of perception.15 He also borrows from the standard astrology hand­books, sometimes studied in the faculties, Ptolemy's Quadripartitum16 and Al­cabitius ( al-Qabisi)'s De principiis astrologiae.17 Antonio quotes the eighth chap­ter of the Quadripartitum, but his quotation (or the copy made by the copyist) is corrupted. He quotes three sources from Hermetic and Solomonic traditions. The first is the De quindecim stellis, quindecim Iapidibus, quindecim herbis et quindecim imaginibus, ascribed to Hermes, with the commentary attributed to the as-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 223 trologer Messahalla, which was broadly diffused in the Middle Ages. Antonio mentions it, or its commentary by Messahalla, four times.18 This work (possi­bly deriving from a Greek source), which was known to the Latin West through Messahalla's version, explains how to make fifteen talismans using the corre­spondence between a star, a stone, an herb, and a figure. More audacious are the references to three works ascribed to Solomon: the Almadel, the Clavicula, and the De angelica fictione. The Almadel or Almandal is a well-known Solomonic text. The Speculum as­tronomiae condemns it as a \"detestable\" work. As Jean-Patrice Boudet has shown, there are two different Latin versions. The first, translated from the Arabic, is found in a manuscript of Florence (Biblioteca nazionale centrale, II.iii.214). The second, which is found in the other manuscripts, is not a translation but a text written directly in Latin.19 The \"Altitudes\" to which Antonio alludes are clearly borrowed from the second, Christianized version. The Clavicula Salomonis is not known to be extant in any Latin manuscripts earlier than a fifteenth-century codex now held in Amsterdam in the Biblio­theca Philosophica Hermetica (BPH 114). An Italian version dated 1446 is held in a manuscript of the Bibliotheque nationale de France (BnF, ltal. 1524). The Latin version of the text was probably written in the second half of the thir­teenth century. It is mentioned by Pietro d'Abano, and then, for the first time after him, it seems, by Antonio da Montolmo.20 The third and last text attributed to Solomon is a De angelica fictione. 21 A quite similar title, De angelica factione (or Jactura), had been ascribed to Apol­lonius by the astrologer Cecco d�scoli, as we will see. Apollonius, who is often cited by Cecco d�scoli, appears twice in the De occultis et manifestis in locations concerned with the Intelligences. There were texts attributed to the ancient au­thority Apollonius of Tyana or Balenuz. According to Montolmo, Apollonius explained how the Intelligences make use of natural potentialities and astral influences, 22 and that therefore magic performed by means of these Intelligences is a combination of magic and astrology.23 Antonio also mentions a pseudo-Aristotelian text on magic (Magica).24 Many apocryphal texts were ascribed to Aristotle in the Middle Ages, the most fa mous being the Secretum secretorum; however, we have not been able securely to iden­tify the Magica with a known text. Nevertheless, Antonio twice quotes this book in locations concerned with the suitable times and places to put questions to spirits and the need to keep the magical art secret. Note that Cecco d�scoli had attributed an Ars magica to Apollonius. 25 Other names belonging to the legend­ary magical tradition-Virgil and Moses-are mentioned as well.26 Antonio refers to the characters used by \"King Charles\" against his enemies. 27 This is probably an allusion to an experimentum found in the same manuscript,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"224 INVOKING ANGELS BnF, lat. 7337, as well as Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vat. lat. 4085. The experi­mentum states that the astrologer Thomas de Pizan (the father of Christine) made an astrological talisman in order to repel the English from the kingdom of France at the time of King Charles V. This experiment is obviously based on the De imaginibus of Thebit, in particular on the section dedicated to the image for ridding a place of scorpions (the scorpions have been replaced by the English, but the experiment is otherwise similar). In fact, this tale is the first in a series of three experiments: there fo llows an experiment ascribed to Bartolomeo di San­gibene, a Venetian working for Duke Leopold, and then a final experiment writ­ten in the first person (\"Practica mea\"). I have hypothesized that the anonymous author who tells the last experiment could be Antonio da Montolmo himself, and that the whole series of experiments could thus be added to the list of his works.28 The reference to King Charles's magical operation in the De manifestis et occultis shows that Antonio was aware of it. At the end of Thomas de Pizan's experiment there is a list of planetary symbols and angelic names-hence ad­dressative signs-that are added to the rather nonaddressative process that was borrowed from Thebit's image, just as Antonio himself adds addressative pro­cesses to the Liber fo rmarum of Hermes. 4· Sacrobosco and Cecco dJ\\.scoli Lynn Thorndike rightly pointed out the closeness between Antonio da Mon­tolmo and Cecco di\\scoli; he wrote that Antonio \"went even farther than Cecco in the direction of astronomical necromancy and magical invocation of spirits:' But, Thorndike says, 'i\\ntonio seems not to cite Cecco in his work:' even though Cecco's commentary on the Sphere of Sacrobosco \"is found in the same manu­script\" (BnF, lat. 7337) as De occultis et manifestis.29 In the second chapter, Antonio da Montolmo seems to come very close to Cecco di\\scoli's approach to nigromantical astrology. At the end of this chapter, he mentions an \"author\" who wrote a chapter de ortu et occasu cronico. This is obviously Johannes de Sacrobosco (John of Holywood or Halifax), the famous author of the Sphere, the standard handbook on cosmology in the arts curriculum since the thirteenth century.30 In the third chapter of this book, Sacrobosco gives three meanings fo r the word ortus (the rising): cosmicus, cronicus, and eliacus. The \"chronic rising'' is also called \"temporal\" (temporalis), and it means the rising of a zodiacal sign or a star at night. The name comes from the fact that the \"time of the astrologers\" (tempus mathematicorum) begins as the sun is setting. Antonio argues that Sacrobosco's text has been corrupted; instead of mathematicorum we should read magicorum, i.e., of the magicians, since the magicians operate at night. This passage comes just after a section in which he describes what \"magi-"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 225 cians are accustomed to say\" and gives several quotations, and his reference to magici here may point to Cecco d'Ascoli.31 But this possible reference to Cecco d'Ascoli is veiled and distorted (like Cecco's own references to many of his sources). Indeed, as I have tried to show elsewhere, Cecco's commentary on the Sphere is an intellectual palimpsest; behind the cosmological/astrological com­mentary there is an astro-nigromantical treatise. One of the processes Cecco uses to introduce the nigromantical sections consists of attributing several meanings to Sacrobosco's technical terms. In this way he imitates the section in which Sacro­bosco himself gives three meanings for the word ortus. In Cecco's view, such terms as colurus, zenith, arcus, clima, and oppositio have at least two meanings: the first, cosmological, astronomical, or astrological, and the second, nigromantical.32 Antonio, in turn, imagines three meanings fo r the term \"horoscope;' fo r in astrology, '1\\.ries is in the horoscope\" obviously means \"Aries is in the ascen­dant:' But in chiromancy, the science of divination from the hands, \"horoscope\" means a \"certain sign\" in the hand. And finally, in the \"magical arts\" it means the \"first decan of Cancer;' which is called by the magicians the \"heart of the North'' (in their view, Cancer is one of the main zodiacal signs). This section seems to borrow heavily from Cecco's commentary. In the section commenting on the meanings of ortus, Cecco describes the ortus figurationis as an expression he claims to have derived from an unknown Liber de motu diurno, ascribed to al-Kind.i. This ortus figurationis would refer to the \"science of images;' the art of making talismans, and Cecco gives an example (allegedly taken from a Liber de mineralibus constellatis): \"if someone wants to make an image in which he seeks an answer from a spirit, the heart of the North has to be ascendant, i.e., Cancer, which is the ascendant of the nigromancers:' Moreover, later in his commentary, Cecco gives three meanings for the \"arcs\" (arcus), an astrological one, a nigromantical one, and a chiromantical one. The astrological meaning (allegedly taken from Al-Kindi's De motu diurno) makes the distinction between the northern arc (from the exaltation of the sun to its setting) and the southern arc (from its setting to the end of the sign of Pisces). The nigromantic meaning (allegedly taken from Solomon's De umbris idearum) tells us about northern spirits called arcus septentrionales: they live in the North, they are of a very noble nature, and they give answers when they are invoked. The chiromantical meaning (as understood, says Cecco, by Abliton in his Chiro­mantia) is finally given: an arc is a line in the hand that signifies future events. Thus Cecco's chiromantic interpretation of arcus actually seems to be the source of Antonio's chiromantical interpretation of horoscopes. 33 Another clue is given in Antonio's mention of a De angelica fictione (On the angelic fiction) that he ascribes to Solomon. Cecco quotes a similar title, De angelica Ja ctura or fa cti one, many times in his commentary on the Sphere and in his commentary on Alcabitius as well, but this was attributed to Apollonius. This"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"226 INVOKING ANGELS work Cecco mentions belongs to the long list of unknown and mysterious works he cites, which makes Antonio's use of Cecco's work even more obvious. Moreover, Antonio's general conception of magic seems close to Cecco's. Like Cecco, the great audacity of their magical writings notwithstanding, Antonio remains within the theologically orthodox framework that makes the distinc­tion between the superlunar world, where the divine grace spreads with an ab­solute monopoly, and the sublunar world, where the demons can act. Therefore he points out that the celestial Intelligences or spirits or angels that are compelled through the divine power are not the good angels but the fallen ones. They must not be confused with the Intelligences that move the planetary spheres, as these were regarded as belonging to the order of Virtues by such an orthodox theolo­gian as Thomas Aquinas34 (Cecco, speaking similarly, alludes to the Powers). Cecco also emphasizes that these Intelligences are angels \"expelled from the heavens:' hence demoniac spirits outside \"the order of grace:'35 Antonio thus seems indebted to Cecco fo r the basic ideas in his astrological nigromancy, grounded in a consistent connection between the spirits and the stars (as in his explanation of the importance of the crossroads, etc.). Beyond a possible community of sources (especially Solomonic sources), it seems quite obvious that Antonio da Montolmo knew Cecco's work. Certainly the death sentence of the audacious astrologer in 1327 may have been sufficient reason for Antonio not to quote him by name. 5· Summary of the De occultis et manifestis In his introduction, Antonio explains that his book will deal with the Intelli­gences following a four-part plan: first, a theoretical part; second, a part tack­ling the occult operations of the Intelligences (i.e., through talismanic images, phylacteries, etc.); third, a part dealing with the manifest operations of the Intel­ligences (the forms in which they appear to virgin people); and fourth, a part dealing with operations concerning people who are not virgins; and perhaps some following practical parts. But in fact Antonio does not follow this plan. Chapter 1, the longest chapter, explains that just as there are four parts in the heavens corresponding to the cardinal signs, so there are four orders of Intelli­gences. This is why exorcisms must be performed at a crossroads of four roads. ·Then, following the Scholastic method, Antonio poses four questions. The first question is: Why do these Intelligences remain under their own car­dinal signs? The answer is that they make use of the influences of these signs. They are opposed to one another just as the stellar influences of these signs are opposed, and when these Intelligences from different quadrants are invoked together"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 227 there is din and rage. Two explanations are given for this: first, they have oppo­site offices, so they fight each other; and second, they do not like to be compelled by humans through divine power. Then Antonio explains that the southern In­telligences, which stand under Capricorn, whose domicile is Saturn, like fetid suffumigations, whereas the other Intelligences like sweet -smelling ones. When these Intelligences are summoned to perform good operations, ·they require sweet-smelling suffumigations, whereas fo r evil actions fe tid suffumigations are needed. Antonio gives several explanations, astrological and theological, for this. The second question is: Why can some people see these spirits while others cannot? The reason is that the Intelligences know how to produce appearances that play with the rules of optics; thus different perceptions may be available to different people, according to their constitutions and abilities. The third question is: Why do these Intelligences appear to virgins rather than to impure persons? Since these Intelligences are fallen angels, they cannot be called virgin; but since their nature is pure, their purity is consonant with the virginity of the summoner. Another reason is given: that sexual intercourse pro­duces a generation of beings endowed with souls, and the Intelligences are jeal­ous of these souls, which have the same dignity that they do. For these reasons, the Intelligences also do not willingly appear to bastards, fo r their birth results from an even more impure act. The fo urth question is: Why do they prefer to appear in materials like water, or dense, clean, transparent bodies like crystals? It is because these materials and bodies allow a more perfect reflection and the Intelligences can thus appear more easily in these media than in the air. Chapter 2 deals with the times when the practices of invocation must be per­fo rmed. The astrological figure in the heavens must be appropriate fo r the purpose sought. Antonio gives a few examples, and he also gives the phases of the moon appropriate fo r the different Intelligences. He stresses the importance of Cancer fo r magical operations and ends the chapter by giving theological reasons why the Intelligences prefer to appear in the first hour of the night. Chapter 3 deals with \"what does and what does not suit the Intelligences and [with] the various influxes of the fo ur signs:' Here Antonio presents the twelve Altitudes (the orders of Intelligences standing under the twelve zodiacal signs) and describes how they react to one another according to the aspects of their respective signs. The operator must also take into account the triplicities of signs and the phases of the moon. Antonio notes that fo r each newborn child, the prince of the Altitude of the child's ascendant sign appoints one of his subjects, whose power is proportional to the social status of this child. This, Antonio sug­gests, is consonant with the idea that every man has an evil opposing angel (just as he has a guardian angel)."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"22 8 INVOKING ANGELS In chapter 4, Antonio discusses the working of images (i.e., talismans) and phylacteries (brevia-rolls filled with magical inscriptions that are enclosed in a small portable object, like the Jewish mezuzah). The ancient sages used such images, he says, to fulfill their wilL and he gives the example of a talismanic image made under the significant celestial points to overcome another person. The rule is astrological: the significant planet of the man whose aim is to overcome another must be in a dominant location over the planet significant for the man who is to be overcome. The \"significant planet\" here may be the planet of nativity (i.e., the horoscope of birth) or the planet of the interrogation (i.e., the horoscope of the moment when the question is asked). Antonio proceeds to make a threefold distinction: images, rings, and phylac­teries can be astrological, magical, or both astrological and magical. The first cat­egory (which is consonant with the purely \"astrological image\" of the Magister Speculi) is based on the correspondence between terrestrial aim and astral sig­nification. Antonio gives details about an image made by a servant to get a better position from a prelate. He then poses three questions: first, how a heavenly qual­ity can induce an inclination in someone to do something; second, why the wax of which the image is made must be clean and virgin; and third, why the aforesaid image would induce such an inclination in this prelate more than in another man. Antonio answers the first question by referring to the astral virtual quality that is instilled in the limbs of any creature when it is born; he compares the ac­tion of the heavens here to that of a traveler who puts good-smelling things in a new wooden bottle in order to impregnate it with the quality of the good smell From this he infers that the newly made image also derives such a quality from the heavens. To the second question, Antonio answers that the wax must be virgin, new, and clean in order not to be impregnated with previous and extra­neous qualities. He answers the third question by explaining that the image is put near the prelate, who is therefore influenced by the nearness of the quality with which the image is endowed; moreover, the will of the operator also directs the influence to the prelate. In this way Antonio also stresses that it is better when the man making the request casts the image or ring himself, for his own confidence is important in the success of the operation, inasmuch as it is through his confidence that his complexion spreads its influence toward the matter of the image. Here Antonio combines the two existing theories of natural magic: >the theory of occult properties based on astrological influence, and the theory of confidence and imagination (drawn from Galen, Avicenna, and maybe al­Kindi).36 From these theories of imagination, Antonio affirms the common be­lief that it is dangerous to meet unfortunate people in the morning. Antonio next undertakes a discussion of the second category of images, rings, and phylacteries, namely, those of a magical nature. He notes first that these"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"DR OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 229 magical processes seem \"rather remote from sensory faculties\" -a remark that apparently alludes to the \"occult\" side of the operations. These operations are performed through rituals like incantations, exorcisms, and suffumigations. Although this passage is not very dear, Antonio seems to describe two types of magical processes: in the first, the Intelligence is compelled by the magician (implicitly through the divine power of God, though this is not _stated); in the second, the Intelligence willingly carries out the required operation because the magician honors it through these rituals (in this case, the Intelligence is explicitly not compelled by God). In this latter kind of operation, the old wives or sorcer­esses are particularly efficient because of their strength of will, which is more powerful than the mere uttering of words of the invocation. A puzzling note at the end of this passage that \"only the will can damn or save\" may refer (in connec­tion with an earlier passage about the motivations of spirits, chapter 1.9) to the idea that the Intelligences are more likely to cooperate with an operator animated with a strong evil will because it is easier to lead such a soul into damnation. Antonio goes on to describe the third way of operating, which is both magi­cal and astrological and is regarded as the most efficient because it combines the natural power of the stellar influences and the intentional power of the Intelli­gences: the Intelligences make use of these astrological influences in order to carry out the operation for which they are compelled through exorcisms. Here, the natural and the spiritual cooperate. Chapter 5 deals with the offices and locations of the Intelligences of the plan­ets. Referring to the ancients, Antonio presents the different and distinctive of­fices of the Intelligences standing under their respective planets: for instance, the saturnine Intelligences have the power to cause melancholic diseases, but also treacheries, etc. He points out that these are not the same as the Intelligences that move the planetary orbs (which most theologians regarded as good angels within the divine grace) but are outside the divine grace, hence located under the lunar orb-a fundamental idea that Antonio may have borrowed from Cecco d/\\.scoli.J? Within this framework, ancient pagan religion is viewed as the cult of these Intelligences (Le., certainly evil Intelligences) acting under each planet. What Antonio describes here is nigromancy, that is, the attempt to obtain the help of angels outside the order of grace, i.e., evil ones. But he says that \"some­one\" maintains that, in the Almadel ascribed to Solomon, the angels involved in the operations are from the Dionysian order of Powers and suggests that these would be the twelve zodiacal Altitudes. This idea suggests, without elaborating, the possibility of another way of magic, i.e., theurgy-an idea that seems rather unorthodox-and moreover an astrological theurgy (since he has already ex­plained that these Altitude-Powers are supposed to act in tandem with the ap­propriate astral influences)."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"230 INVOKING ANGELS Then Antonio treats the meteorological conditions required for such opera­tions. The weather has to be quiet and clear so that the Intelligence, which acts through nature, can cause shapes to appear more easily. Antonio implicitly con­fesses to doing such experiments, or witnessing them, when he writes, \"I figured out through experiment that when the weather is rainy they can also produce appearances, but not so easily:' The locations for such invocations must be secret, because the Intelligences do not like to show they are compelled by the divine power, and also because our senses are more able to be moved by the operations of these Intelligences when we are in seclusion. Chapter 6 explains the reasoning behind the acts, signs, and objects of magi­cal operations. In this chapter we find discussion of the standard requirements fo r Solomonic magic. First, Antonio lists the required conditions: an efficient opera­tor must be born under an appropriate constellation, be learned, eloquent, etc., and also must be a good Catholic, for the operator is supposed to act through the divine power. Circles are an essential element in Solomonic magic (and nigro­mancy): the summoner operates within a circle in order to protect himself against the spirits invoked. Antonio explains that the choice of such a geometri­cal figure is justified by the fact that the circle is the divine figure that embraces the whole; hence it is the most perfect figure. Moreover, it is called \"the name of God\" and therefore has a protective effect against the evil spirits invoked during these operations. Antonio ends his treatise by discussing such distinctive elements of Solomonic magic as the characters that are to be inscribed, the pentacles, the ritual of purification before performing the operation, and the suffumigations. 6. Some Theoretical Features of the Treatise Antonio da Montolmo's treatise is entitled De occultis et manifestis or Liber in­telligentiarum for reasons he gives in the prooemium (§3), where he makes the distinction between the \"occult\" and the \"manifest\" operations of the lntelli­gences.38 In the first category he includes such operations as images, phylacteries, and so on; in the second he includes the way the Intelligences appear to virgin persons. Thus, in manifest operations, the Intelligences appear to the summoner in an explicit way, whereas in images and phylacteries their actions remain hid­den from·human perception. Such a distinction is reminiscent of Thomas Aqui­-nas's concerning nigromantical and astrological images: both derive their power from demons, but the nigromantical images involve explicit and deliberate invo­cations (expressae invocationes) and hence are based on an explicit or deliberate pact (expressa pact) with demons, whereas the images \"which they call astro­logical\" are based on tacit or implicit pacts with demons.39 Later (3.1), Antonio"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"DE OCCUL1'IS ET MANIFESTIS 231 uses this distinction between occult and manifest to make the distinction between two kinds of enmity between two Altitudes whose respective signs are astrologi­cally opposed, according to a square or an opposite aspect, respectively. But the real purpose of the De occultis et manifestis is to give theoretical ex­planations, in particular astrological ones, fo r processes taken from nigromanti­cal and Solomonic treatises. The model he builds is very complicated and very imaginative. Antonio tries to find a kind of general rationality iri practical pro­cesses whose reasons are certainly not those that he suggests. In his Sp eculum astronomiae, the anonymous author had defined three kinds of images, two nigromantical (the ''abominable\" or Hermetic images and the Solomonic or \"detestable\" images), and one the purely \"astrological images:· An­tonio divides talismanic images, phylacteries, and so on into a more practical and logical threefold typology: first, magical (or operating through spirits); second, astrological; and third, magical and astrological at the same time. Purely magical operations, based on the invocations of demons, rely also on the inten­tion and will of the operator, and because of the strength of their will, old wives are often particularly good at it. Astrological images are those grounded only in astrology without any invocation, just like those defined in the Sp eculum astro­nomiae (a work Antonio does not mention but that he obviously knows). Finally, there is the astrological-magical way to make images and other operations, which, Antonio suggests, seems the most efficient. He himself has made use of this kind of magic, he tells us. 40 And if he is the writer of the three exp erimenta mentioned above, then he is clearly advising the use of the names of Intelligences in the making of images. Note that this threefold typology was also promoted by a later magician, Giorgio Anselmi da Parma, and even later by the cautious physician Jerome To rrella, who rejected any addressative processes.41 Thus the De occultis et manifestis is, above all, a theoretical treatise that aims at giving an astrological explanation for a nigromancy based on the summoning of Intelligences. In his treatises, Antonio presents three kinds of Intelligences. First, he dis­cusses the Intelligences that stand under the four cardinal signs, i.e., Aries (east), Libra (west), Capricorn (south), and Cancer (north). Under these fo ur parts of the heavens there are four orders of Intelligences. Thus, under the eastern part there is Oriens, the first Intelligence of the eastern order. Antonio does not give the names of the three other first Intelligences of their respective cardinal orders, but we can learn them from the Solomonic sources: these are Amaymon, Pay­non, and Egym.42 But the eastern Intelligences are nobler than the others. Each of the cardinal signs is associated with the two other signs of its triplicity: fiery signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), airy signs (Libra, Gemini, Aquarius), earthy signs (Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus), and watery signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces). The Intelligences of these fo ur orders are clearly evil, for their specific offices are"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"232 INVOKING ANGELS sinful: lust, greed, and so on. Fornifer (a spirit mentioned in 1.5) may belong to one of these orders of Intelligences: this demon makes use of the influences of Venus in order to incline human beings toward lust. The second kind oflntelligences are those that belong to the orders called Alti­tudes. These Intelligences are mentioned in the Almadel, which, as we have seen, Antonio cites. But with respect to them he mentions another source: the De angelica fictione, which Cecco d'Ascoli also quoted. These Intelligences are called \"angels;' but this does not necessarily signify good angels, since this term also is applied once to the evil Intelligences of the cardinal signs. There are twelve Alti­tudines, and each of them is located under one of the twelve zodiacal signs-hence, under the heavens, just like all the evil Intelligences; but Antonio does not say clearly whether these Intelligences are really evil. There are three eastern, three western, three southern, and three northern Altitudes. Implicitly referring to an underlying common tradition, Antonio asserts that when a child is born, just as there is a specific guardian angel present, so there is an opposing evil angel sent by the prince of the Altitude. For this reason, these Altitudes might seem to be orders of evil Intelligences; but later in his treatise (5.3), Antonio writes that \"some people maintain\" that the Altitudes are to be identified with the order of good angels called the order of Powers in the Dionysian hierarchy. Note that the source to which Antonio refers here is the \"Almadel ascribed to Solomon.\" In his Glosa, he somewhat tentatively suggests that, for faithful people who might be afraid to invoke evil Intelligences, these are safe to work \\>\\.ith, noting that the Powers have the protection of humankind from evil spirits as their particular office.43 To a third kind oflntelligences belong those of the planets. They perform their operations according to the different influences and nature of their respective planets. Thus, under Mars, the Martian Intelligence rules wars, fights, and enmi­ties; and under Venus, the respective Intelligence causes love and amorous de­lights. But Antonio dearly emphasizes that these planetary Intelligences are not the Intelligences or angels that move the planetary orbs in the heavens; they are \"deprived of the divine grace:' These Intelligences were actually the pagan gods worshipped by the ancients. Antonio also faces the problem of evil. For example, the eastern Intelligences are noble by nature, but they are also evil (in other words, demons). Cecco d'Ascoli had also stressed the noble nature of certain Intelligences-they inher­ited their nobility from the time when they lived beside God in the heavens, before their fa ll.'14 Antonio must also resolve other paradoxical situations, such as the fact that some evil Intelligences are attracted by sweet-smelling suffumi­gations or by virginity, which seem to belong to divine grace, hence the compli­cated explanations, both logical and astrological.45 Thus, like Cecco d'Ascoli, Antonio da Montolmo seems to respect, in theory, the division of the sphere between, on the one hand, a superlunar space, where"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 233 divine grace spreads itself and where there are only good angels, such as the Powers and the angels that move the orbs, and, on the other hand, a sublunar world, where orders of demons (with a hierarchy of princes and subjects) rule the sinful operations of the magicians according to the astrological influences that they receive and of which they make use. Like Cecco, Antonio tries to fr ame an astrologica interpretatio of nigromancy. The main problem he must solve concerns the gap between the superlunarand sublunar worlds. How can the evil Intelligences, which inhabit the sublunar world, be connected with the world of the stars? The issue, the articulation of the astrological configurations in the heavens and the actions of demons, is based on the idea that the demons dwell beneath these astrological places and act ac­cording to the influences of these planets and constellations: they use the stellar influences to perform the operations the magicians require. Perhaps the most significant section of the work is p, where Antonio explains that the relations between the orders of Intelligences called Altitudes are ruled by the aspects of their respective signs. When the aspect is benevolent (trine, sextile), the corre­sponding Altitudines are fr iends. When there is a square aspect, the respective Altitudines are opposed, but in a hidden or occult way. When the aspect is op­posite, the corresponding Altitudines are contrary in a manifest way. But the as­trologica interpretatio goes further: thus, referring to astrology, Antonio explains why some suffumigations used in the invocations have to be sweet -smelling and other ones fe tid. For example, in order to summon the Intelligences located under Capricorn, the magician has to make fe tid suffumigations with sulfur and asafoetida because Capricorn is a melancholic sign, domicile of Saturn, a planet that emits fe tid rays. The hand that annotates the text46 writes, at the beginning of chapter 3, \"What­ever has been said in the introduction about the signs, you have to understand it about the Altitudes in all respects:' And later in chapters: \"Whatever has been said in the introduction, in fa ct you may understand the same about the corre­sponding Intelligences.\" Although Antonio da Montolmo, like Cecco d'Ascoli, may seem audacious and unorthodox, he tries, as we have seen, to give a theoretical basis, more or less compatible with the Christian fr amework, for practical texts or recipes he has seen. In fact, the operative magical texts he is trying to explain are not built upon such a theoretical platform of requirements and rules as the one he syn­thesizes to support them. The Hermetic texts are based on invocations of astral spirits, possibly coming (at least partially) fr om the pagan cults of the Sabeans of Harran (as David Pingree has suggested)Y The Solomonic texts, which be­long to the Judeo-Christian tradition, are generally based on the invocations of demons that have to be compelled (although sometimes they involved a theurgy based on good angels).48 Unlike Hermetic magic, Solomonic magic does not view"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"2.34 INVOKING ANGELS astrology as an essential requirement; nevertheless, Solomonic sources are the primary material that Cecco and Antonio use in building their \"astrological nigromancy.\" So the primary challenge of these two authors is to synthesize the astrological magic with the much less astrological Solomonic sources, which, despite their sometimes frightening and sinful content, were more in tune with the Christian demonological framework. Within these pa rameters, Antonio's as­trologica interpretatio, or logical reflections on evil and good rituals, are his own, with obvious influence from Cecco. 7· The Present Edition This edition of the De occultis et manifestis is based on the only known extant manuscript (BnF, lat. 7337), where it fills nine double-column pages with mod­ern page numbering (pp. 1-9). The manuscript contains magical and astrologi­cal texts.49 The numerous mistakes and misunderstood words dearly show that it is not an autograph. The copyist, probably a fifteenth-century Italian, was not a very clever Latinist, and he obviously misread many passages. As a result, the editor's job has been a difficult one. Some sections are unintelligible or contra­dictory, and sometimes I had to try to imagine what the original text might have said in order to suggest a possible meaning. Such reconstructions are sometimes highly hypothetical; but the critical footnotes may help the reader to find better solutions if he can. I have tried to respect the orthographical peculiarities of the text, except when the forms led to misunderstanding or when the correct form appeared at least once. The medieval form e instead of the diphthong ae has been respected. A hand (fifteenth-sixteenth-century?) wrote few notes in the margins, some­times giving the general topics undertaken in the text-for example, p. 2a (on 1.7 ): Electio horarum conformis; p. 2b (on 1.8): suffumigia. On p. 4b, in the superior margin at the beginning of chapter 3, there is the remark \"Quecumque in intro­ductorio dicuntur de signis, eadem tu intelligas de altitudinibus per om<n>ia''; and in the inferior margin, \"Tempus proportionate ad omnia opera et si a loco planetarurn omnium et eorum qualitatibus maxime tamen sumuntur per motum et situs et qualitates Solis et Lune.\" On p. sa (on 3.4), we read, \"Lune qualitates in quadric\"; on p. 7b, in the superior margin at the beginning of chapter 5, \"Que­cumque de planetis in introductorio dicuntur, eadem tamen de intelligentiis eis proportionalibus intelligas\"; on p. 8a, in the superior margin (concerning s.s}, \"Tempus proportionate intelligentiis planetarum et signorum clarum, quietum, serenum''; in the right margin (concerning s.s), \"Tempus quoad suas qualitates et quoad horam''; below, in the same margin (concerning 5.6), \"Secreta loca"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 235 tempora et persone''; in the inferior margin (concerning 5.6), \"Locus proportio­nalis planetis et signis aut eorum intelligentiis secretus mundus quietus odorif­erus si ad bonum:' A few corrections are made in the Latin text, probably by the same hand. A later, modern hand wrote the title of the work twice, first at the beginning of the codex, Antonii de Monte Ulmi de occultis et manifestis artium; and on p. 1a, in the superior margin, Antonii de Monte Ulmis [sic!], De occultis et manifestis Artium. 50 As we will see, \"artium\" does not pertain to the title. The word de­pends on the qualification of the author, who is \"artium et medicine doctoris,\" i.e., doctor of arts and medicine. NOTES 1.

What indeed do we know? What do we know about nature in this world, since an absolutely certain truth is impossible for us? And anyone who seems to know many things in this age <is> like a blind man who walks with the assistance of a cane but guides other blind men who are harnessed with him. Hence, the physician orders medical recipes, the lawyer gives advice, the rhetori­cian persuades, the notary writes abbreviated notes, the merchant stands as a guarantor; everybody in this world leads his life, though ends it pretty miserably. Thus everybody ignores where he comes from and who he is and where he is going. But even if we seem to live fo llowing a kind of path of servitude, we may strive to be assimilated with the Prime Mover, which thus teaches <us> to contemplate something among the knowable things. For the person who devotes himself to speculation really seems to love God, as it appears in the fa ther of philosophy Aristotle's tenth book of Ethics. 2 And he teaches <us> to speculate on knowable things among noble topics, since he asserts that it is better to know very little about noble things than a lot about base ones.3 [2.] And indeed the Intelligences themselves are noble substances created with knowledge and nobility. Therefore, it is rightly advisable to contemplate them very often in accordance with the harmony and course of nature, because if human nature as such is not able to know so clearly, but only in a confused way, we must contemplate them, so that, becoming more perfect and endowed with greater knowledge, we may have another life. [3] Therefore I decided to hand on the universal rules, as is shown in the theoreti­cal part. In the second part, the occult operations of the Intelligences, such as images, phylacteries (brevibus),4 and other similar things, are to be dealt with. In the third part, the manifest operations of those <Intelligences> are to be dealt with, as far as they appear to virginity [i.e., to virgin people], etc. In the fo urth and last part, the operations concerning people who are outside virginity [i.e., who are not virgins] will be dealt with. Once the theoretical part is written, I shall com­pose an introduction to the fo llowing parts.

First, why, since these Intelligences can act indifferently, are they established (as someone has said) under the four cardi­nal signs and constellations? Second, how is it that when, for instance, two or three or several of us are standing equally near <to them>, with equally good sense organs, with the full attention of our minds and a medium so well disposed, one of us will perceive their natures and will see many forms of evidence for them, but another will neither hear nor see anything? That seems contrary to what is said by the Philosopher in his second book On the soul,9 because a suitable me­dium and the good condition of the organs, at an appropriate distance, with the attention of the soul, and when the quantity of the object is suitable, actually causes a sensation. Third, why does this appear rather to virgins and people who have not recently been polluted than to corrupted and impure persons? Fourth, why do these <Intelligences> appear more in water and in dense, clean, and trans­parent bodies than in bodies not so dense? [5] To the first question, I answer that the disposition of the heavens is required in the operations of these Intelligences. The reason for this is that the knowledgeable and very wise and very first Intelligence, thanks to its knowledge and skill at using the sacred influxes of the heavens, inclines our ensouled bodies sometimes to good and sometimes to evil. Hence, in order to deceive mankind more easily, the <very first Intelligence> set in order some of its own princes,10 who possess for that purpose a property similar to the property and influx of some part of the heavens: <thus> after this quality has been brought down from the heavenly re­gion into created things, they incline created beings, and are able more easily to deceive created beings with the like operation-as Fornifer,Uwhose office is lust under the signs and stars of Venus.

The second cause is perfectly consonant with our fa ith: I believe that it displeases them to be constrained by divine power and, indeed, by us, for they realize that they could have been divine beings if they were living in the divine hierarchies,15 and now they seem to act as if they were con­strained by their own servants.

The reason fo r this is that Capricorn is a melancholic sign, [planetary] house of Saturn, and it domi­nates in the southern part, as has been said, and Saturn with this sign produces a fe tid ray, and thus the suffumigation of Saturn is fe tid; and these <intelligences standing under Capricorn> take delight in fe tid houses and therefore are located in the southern parts. Such Intelligences require Saturnine suffumigations like sulfur and asafoetida. I say these things by reason of the influxes of Capricorn under which the princes of this sign operate.18 And that is why when the impure southern spirits are constrained to be enclosed into phials or crystal vessels or into other places, they have to be kept in fe tid places like dung, etc. But this is not the case for other Intelligences, since the eastern Intelligences, because of the no­bility of their signs, take delight in cleanliness and are kept in lustrous places and in red silk, etc. From this one can infer by corollary that when exorcists <operate> under some <celestial> point and ascendant that are appropriate to that order of angels, they observe the ascendant and the disposition <of the heavens>; <when> most things are dominant over another order, they also change themselves in a manner concordant to that other order, and so on for others.

Thus, each Intelligence by reason of honor requires sweet­smelling fumigations (but by reason of celestial influx it is something different), and the same can be said about the different clothes. But why do these Intelligences take delight in suffumigation although they do not have sense organs? A cause consonant with our faith might be that, since they can seduce mankind to per­form a sacrifice for them, these Intelligences are delighted and more willingly come because this sin greatly displeases the Creator.20 For it is said: You must not wor­ship an alien god21 nor sacrifice to him. But an astrological cause might be, as the great Apollonarius or Apollonius said,22 that these Intelligences do not act except through a mediating natural disposition and celestial influx. Therefore they re­quire honors, places, and times that are proportionate to their <celestial> influxes under the heavens. And the suffumigations are changed according to the different influxes. But the fetid suffumigation seems to be unjustified, if the so-called astro­logical cause and the cause consonant with our faith are dismissed. I answer that it is displeasing to them as a replacement for the honor they wish to receive; thus, when a bad suffumigation is performed, they are more powerfully and more will­ingly moved to evildoing by the displeasure they feel, because they are constrained at first in order that a more serious punishment may be imposed later upon the exorcist: after the suffumigation has displeased the Intelligence into evildoing, it wishes to please the man who constrained it, in order to lead him toward a more serious punishment.

Because virginity is a kind of purity, the angels must be called pure and not virgin; but because of the likeness between the purity they have and virgins, they appear to them more quickly than to others. And likewise children can do that better than adults.24 But why are such Intelligences more likely to appear to those who have not recently been polluted than to those who have recently been polluted? The reason is the secondary cause whereby people are unpolluted or not recently polluted. The end pursued through lust displeases <the Intelligences>, since thereby generations of bodies are produced, and-according to faith-generations of souls, upon whom, if they are well produced, is bestowed the rank of their own dignity. Therefore they fe el very jealous of us. But since the main reason is that they are themselves pure, this dirty act that is contrary to virginity and purity absolutely displeases them, and therefore generally in magical operations the practitioners reject this dirty act and advise that it not be committed. It is not the same for other practices, because as far as the absence <of these dirty acts> goes, they are not so detestable, because purity is the main characteristic of angels.

Solomon explains about these Altitudes in his so-called On angelic fiction [De angelica fictione]. 36 [2] Also note that when the sun comes into a sign, any Altitude of angels that is located under it is strengthened as to its angelic operations and office of angels; and then someone who is about to operate observes the coming of the sun into the sign of this Altitude if he wishes to obtain the help of the aforesaid Altitude; and he must dispose the moon in a sign that is in a trine or sextile aspect with the sun, so that the Intelligences that are under the sign where the moon is bring help and favor to the Intelligences and to the prince of the Altitude of the sign where <the sun> is. [3] Note that there are three Altitudes of Intelligences that have the same influx, namely, three eastern, three western, three southern, and three other northern ones,37 just as <there is a> triplicity of signs. The eastern Altitudes are powerful when the sun is in one of the signs included between sunrise and midday, espe­cially at the day, hour, and season of the year that is the time of the sun, because this eastern time is consonant with the eastern signs. But the southern and the other Altitudes are powerful at the time that is consonant with their own signs."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"262 INVOKING ANGELS [4] Nota etiam quod hec Altitudines, scilicet occidentis et orientis, potestatem habent cum Luna crescit; quia orientales lntelligentie, ex quo placatores solum reputant Lunam crescere requiri pro sufficienti tempore, quia sufficit spiritibus bassis orientalibus, quorum aliqui sunt parvorum officiorum et quasi ignoran­tes quia non possunt nee sciunt nisi quasdam illusiones et res truffaticas quas­dam.

This is why the waxing of the moon during a suitable time is sufficient. The cause for that is, as Ptolemy says in his Quadripartitum, in the first treatise; in chapter 8: Indeed, the moon, from the new moon to full moon heats; and from the new moon to the first quarter it moistens; from the full moon to the <last> quarter, it dries; and from the full moon to its combustion, it cools. 38 On this account, since the moon is a planetary body nearer to us and its operations are more manifest to us, when it is waxing, it is suited to the eastern spirits; but when it is waning, its influx is suited to the cold Intelligences. [s] Also note that it is usually said: \"when the moon is in an even number with the sun'' -for they say that the moon is in an even number with the sun when the number of days since its combustion is even. Evenness and oddness do not change or vary according to this celestial influx.

And from this also it is inferred that, since the angels operate under such influxes, therefore, when somebody is born, the prince of the Altitude of the as­cendant sign disposes to the newborn child one of his subjects who has greater or lesser operating power according to the greater or lesser social status of the child; this is consonant with our faith, which asserts and says that each newborn child has his own opposing angel.40"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"264 INVOKING ANGELS Capitulum quartum: De causis ymaginum ac brevium et similium [1] <S>apientes antiqui usi sunt diversis ymaginibus, aliquibus ad superandum alios, aliquibus ad amorem, etc. Ad superandum alios faciunt ymaginem consi­derando quando planeta dominus nativitatis sue vel interrogationis-cum talis planeta fortunatus-elevatus fuerit super alium planetam, alteri infortunatum; tunc talis planeta elevatus influit radium suum in suo subiecto, vincente et su­biiciente60 radium alterius planete supra elevato.

And there are many doubts and errors here, so may the hearer pardon me if I digress to a slight extent. [2] You will note that there are three kinds of images, rings, phylacteries, or other things used in these operations, because there is a type that is astrological, a type that is magical, and a type that is both astrological and magicalY The astrological work is that which is made in astrology, when the matter is well disposed for the effect you seek to work under certain constellations. For example, an image is made for acquiring a better position from some prelate in this way: the lord of the ascendant of the prelate's nativity or the significator of the interrogation is put in a bodily conjunction43 or in trine or sextile aspect with the lord of the servant's nativity or with the significator of his complexion, and the prelate's significator is put in a perfect conjunction with these points.44 I shall not give here the significa­tion of the servant's significator in a good place on his astrological chart,45 and I shall not give the other required conditions either.

To the first question, I answer that each created being receives into its very delicate limbs, at the moment of its birth, a virtual quality of the heavens, bequeathed by the rul­ing Power of Mars, which proceeds especially from the planet ruling at that time, and is absorbed into these limbs at th eir origin and remains latent in this being until its death. For the influx of the heavens is very powerful, and i( is received in the subject thus newly denuded so that it may receive the thing from nature. Therefore, if this quality is balanced and good, it induces an inclination to the good, and if it is bad, it induces an inclination to evil. [4] An example concerning a traveler: When a traveler buys a new wooden bottle, first he puts good-smelling things in it so that the quality of smell will be fixed in the wood; and because the bottle is new and deprived of another strong smell, this smell is therefore more strongly received by this bottle when it is new. Whence there is no doubt for the philosopher that this celestial disposition, which has been fixed in the limbs of the newborn child, continuously and proportionally disposes him in such a way that the agent (which you have prompted to act) has a greater subtlety and a better balance for such a subject, because the disposition of the subject is facilitated to receptivity. And hence, when a planet is unfortunate, it sends an unbalanced ray into such a subject. Therefore, because the influx of the planet has remained in an image of this kind-because it was predominant at its nativity-it is amicably and proportionally conjoined to, and modified by, the influx of the planet predominant in the nativity of the servant; and I say this in regard to an image or ring of this kind. For which reason, if the servant carries such an image with him in the presence of the prelate and speaks with him or puts it at the place where the prelate is staying, especially if the prelate touches or sees it, this celestial quality that is in the wax is actually multiplied and received in the complexion of the prelate, because the complexion of the prelate is altered and modified by this quality. Therefore, such a prelate is inclined to love of such a man, because his complexion has been mixed and assimilated to the celestial in­flux of his servant as far as this virtual quality is concerned."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"268 INVOKING ANGELS [5] Nota etiam quod ille qui facit ymaginem cum forti voluntate commovetur eius complexio et sanguis et spiritus eius, et multiplicatur ab extra per poros cutis et alia loca, et redpitur a tali materia sic permixta, et est plus determinata ad istum servitorem quam ad alium propter individuate medium sue complexio­nis, quod sic est in tali viro quod non in alio.

And so, the third doubtful case ha� been resolved (6] From this I infer by corollary that if an astrologer, at the request of someone, wants to make a ring or an image, it is better if the man at whose request it is made casts the ring or the image with a powerful confidence so that the particular con­fidence of his own complexion is received into the material. And you can figure out why it is said over the image: \"1, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, make an image for this person, etc:': because on account of the powerful expression of his voice, the man is more intensely moved, and his complexion is powerfully altered, and his powerful quality is multiplied outside of him, and so consequently this quality is more intensely received into the material.46 And if the man who makes the image could perform the conjuration as strongly when he was silent, the effect of the image would turn out just as well as with him speaking. It is otherwise for magical images. From what has been said you can infer by corollary that astro­logical images operate through the multiplication of the quality that is in them and do so through the drawing near of touch, or sight, or any other sense. [7] Also note that these diverse types of complexions are given names among cre­ated beings, and some individuals are rather strong, and others rather weak. Thus, the individuals who are strong in terms of the balance of their complexions re­ceive the impression of a strong complexion of spirits in a material of this kind, such that its power appears strongly, as is made plain by some individuals who make an incantation against quartan fever; they cure it very quickly with certain words, <but> it will be possible fo r a cure to occur otherwise by vain processes."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"270 INVOKING ANGELS [8] Hoc patet experimento: Quando talis incantator propter fortem confiden­tiam movetur, eius complexio et spiritus et ipsius species representata in com­plexione infirmi representat qualitatem virtualiter contrariam ipsi melancolie talis extranee.

And just as similar strong qualities are fo und, so in some individuals can be fo und created qualities that are hostile and contrary to the balance and proportions of a human's individual complexion. And if one such created being hates another, and when he sees him is moved to enmity, then with only a glance or a touch he can infect the other or make him sick, because he can place a virtual quality in his complexion that is contrary to it and unbalance it. And therefore I will not deny that, because of a strong enmity, he could make him sick. 47 [9) From this I infer that the common people rightly say: \"This morning I met an unfortunate man or my enemy, so this day will not be good for me:' because that quality was newly encountered in the morning, since at that time the man is, for the most part, free of other human qualities, and maybe those of fo rtunate men or his own friends.

But sometimes the Intelligence is compelled to do what the operator wants ac­cording to the effect that he seeks, and <the operator> makes an image <that is suitable> to this <aim> and he writes the names of the Intelligences on it, and he makes suffumigations and he gives honor <to them> and he invokes <them> benevolently and kindly, and <the Intelligence> is not constrained by the divine power; thus such an Intelligence, because of the honor and prayers that are made for it, is moved to obtain the sought-for thing.

Thus, under the planet Saturn there is the Intelligence that has the power to cause melancholic diseases in the soul, <as well as> the wasting of the bo dy, treacheries, foul actions, and deceptions. Under Mars there fs the Intel­ligence that contains wars, fights, and enmities. Under Jupiter there is the Intelli­gence that ruled every form of good for the ancients. Thus, in ancient times Jupi­ter was called the father of gods, and sacrifices were made to him in preference to all the other gods. And you will say the same about the Intelligence of Venus, which is the cause for love and delights, and about the Intelligence of Mercury, which is the cause of all subtleties of skill and eloquence, and so on for the other planetary Intelligences. [2] And do not think that I am talking of the Intelligences appropriate for plane­tary orbs, for I am actually talking of the Intelligences deprived of the divine grace. 52 From this it is inferred that the ancients did not worship the bodies of the planets, but they actually worshipped the aforesaid Intelligences, which gave them answers, and that is why you will find invocations and prayers according to the seven planets53 in some books of magic, i.e., according to the Intelligences of these. [3] Also note that it seems to me hardly believable that, just as these Intelligences operate under the celestial influxes, similarly the Intelligences and angels estab­lished and ordered in grace can act to contain and repel the offices and operations of evil angels while acting under the af oresaid influxes, because they can more easily be persuasive to humankind when it is properly disposed. And these good angels belong to the order that is called Powers; and someone54 wants to maintain that these are the good angels that operate in the Almadel ascribed to Solomon, and <this book> established twelve of them as Altitudes, just as there are twelve celestial signs. 55 Thus the operator must cautiously observe <astrological configu­rations> and operate especially according to the hours and experiments appropri­ate for the planets."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"278 INVOKING ANGELS [4] Gratia exempli: Amor in hoc proposito potest esse duplex, scilicet amor honestus, qui est inter bonos, et amor concupiscentie.

And the reason fo r this is that Intelligences operate only naturally when they produce their appear­ances; they actually change the air with the light and with diverse applications of this light, and so they produce the different colors that appear to us in the air. Therefore if the air were neither light nor pure, then they would have neither due light nor clean air in order to be able the better to appear; but in rainy and windy air they do it with great difficulty, because the wind changes the air and alters the figures assumed by the spirits; therefore this is hardly done when the weather is rainy and the air is neither pure nor suitable nor light, which is why these Intel­ligences cannot easily produce due appearances, although I figured out through experiment that when the weather is rainy they can also produce appearances, but not so easily. 57 Therefore the weather must be appropriate for the operation, clear and quiet."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"280 INVOKING ANGELS [ 6] Reperitur etiam locus in quo tempore de bent convocari vel extra eo rum experimenta committi.no Qui111locus debet esse secretus, quia ipsis displicet sic palam virtute divina constringi, 112 et etiam commodius possunt nostros sensus movere non impeditos a representatione multorum sensibilium.

Then the names of God the Most High are inscribed with an intense devotion and a blessed suffumigation; with litanies, psalms, and perfect prayers, the encircled space is blessed, and by these <rituals> all the aerial Powers are terrorized and they do not seem to approach the aforesaid place. Hence the exorcist marks the circle with very great devotion and with a contrite mind, after confession has been made.64 Characters are-signs ascribed to creatures, and some are found to be good and some evil. The good characters were given by blessed God himself to his worthy servants, as to King Charles against his enemies65 and also the names <given> to Moses,66 and to many others who worked wonders in the world. But the evil characters were discovered by the spirits themselves, 67 and they are the signs of those who want the creatures to operate in their honor. And when the characters are suffumigated and inscribed with a suitable ink and on a suitable paper,68 and with a benevolent prayer ad­dressed to them, the <spirits> take it as an honor and they try hard to carry out what is written in the phylactery. And, by contrast, if someone inscribes the char­acters of a spirit on an unsuitable paper, with an unsuitable ink, and with an un­suitable suffumigation, but with intense constraint, the exorcist inflicts pain and shame on the spirits. [5] Also note that pentacles for this purpose have been discovered and were given through divine power; and on them were inscribed the most high and most be­nevolent names of God69 -and inscribed by a Catholic writer with intense devo­tion, due prayers, and solemnities, as it has been demonstrated elsewhere. Thus the pentacle is carried in perfect devotion and perfect protection; and it may be shown to the spirits: they tremble just at the memory of the exorcism by divine power.70 [6] Also note that fo r preparing these arts the protection must be strong, with suffumigations, baths, papers [within phylacteries], invocations, and other simi­lar things, inasmuch as the suffumigations with which the circle must be fumi­gated, and with which even the exorcist and his associates are suffumigated, must be blessed, consecrated by a Catholic word with due prayers and processes, and the same with the bath and the paper; and all these things are for the protection of the exorcists. 71 But the suffumigations that are performed for the sacrifice made to the spirits ought not to be exorcized in this way, since it would tend to put these spirits to flight more than to honor them, by reason that they are divinely conse­crated.72 But the suffumigations, the papers, and other things addressed to those <spirits> must be exorcized in their own names73 with benevolence and a prayer addressed to them."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"286 INVOKING ANGELS [7] Nota etiam quod in operationibus magicis que sunt per placationem et vir­tutem spirituum, debet fieri cum orationibus benivolis ad ipsos, nee cum con­strictione virtute divina fiant, quia null atenus exocizator consequeretur.

Here ends this treatise. NOTES 1. In this and the fo llowing two instances, the text gives inscibilibus. It is difficult to make a definite decision as to whether we should read inscibilibus or in scibilibus. The verb speculor (like contemplari, a few lines down) can imply seeking after a knowledge that is not direct, that is, grounded partially on hypothesis or on a very high thought (just as with the modern verb \"to speculate\"). If the correct read­ing were inscibilibus, Antonio would mean that among the \"unknowable\" things, lowly creatures cannot speculate except on a very small number of them. This reading seems more interesting in the way it alludes to one possible sense of\"occult\" in the title of the work, \"On occult and manifest things.\" If we read the text this way, however, the last instance of inscibilibus would become grammatically problematic, since the text gives speculari inscibilibus, which would make necessary an emendation to speculari <de> inscibilibus. Avoiding this emendation is the only reason to choose in scibilibus instead of inscibilibus, but it is not a compulsory one. 2.

The Clavicula Salomonis, l.6, Amsterdam, Bibliotheca PhUosophica Hermetica (here­after BPH), 114, p. 104, explains that Oriens was witnessed in the byzantine tradition of the Hygroman­tia Salomonis. In the Christianized version of A/mandai (or A/made/), Oriens is not mentioned among the eastern Intelligences (Thaor, Corona, and Hermon); see note 10 below.

But in his commentary on Alcabitius, concerning the moon's nodes (the Dragon's Head and Tail ), Cecco gives his young students (iuvenes) the astrological mean­ing, and the older students (maiores) the magical one: the importance of the intersection of circles as the places under which occult operations are produced: \"Vos autem maiores, debetis intelligere quod in ista intersecatione circulorum multe sunt operationes occulte que ignote sunt particulari nature, ut dicit Astafon in libro De mineralibus constellatis, ubi ad licteram sic dicit: '0 quanta est virtus quam habet intersectio circulorum, que ignota est particulari nature:\" Scriptum super librum de principiis astrologie, in Il commento inedito di Cecco d'Ascoli all'Alchabizzo, ed. Giuseppe Boffito (Florence: Leo S. Olschki, 1905), 16. 9· Aristotle De anima II.7, 41.9a-b, for example. 10. In the Christianized version of Almadel or Almandal, there are twelve Altitudines or Intelli­gences, distributed according to the four cardinal points, and each of them has authority over its own princes (see, fo r example, Vat. lat. 3180, fols. 47V-5u). On Almadet see the Introduction. u. The name Fornifer obviously derives from the word fo rnicatio (as J.-P. Boudet suggests) and the verb fe ro-hence, the demon that induces lust. This name of the fallen angel is not mentioned among the names of demons in Boudet, \"Les Who's Who demonologiques:' 12. Cf. Albert the Great, Scripta super quattuor libros sententiarum, Il.vii.9, in Alberti Magni, Opera omnia, 21 vols. (Lyon: Petrus )ammy, 1651), 15:87. 13. The term exorcisator appears many times in the Clavicula Salomonis and De quatuor anulis, referring to the master who wishes to compel the demons (in De quatuor anulis the word artifex is also used). Moreover, the practice of turning toward the cardinal points while saying exorcisms and con­jurations or performing other operations is an essential requirement in the Clavicula Salomonis and De quatuor anulis. 14. Cf. Cecco d'Ascoli, In spheram mundi enarratio, chapter 3, p. 403, BnF, lat. 7337, p. 36b. When tackling the demons of the elements, Cecco writes that the demons of the earth produce horrendous screams at night. See We ill-Parot, \"I demoni della Sfera.» But note that these kinds of horrendous and noisy demonic apparitions are also mentioned, for instance, in the Clavicula Salomonis, 11.22. (BPH, 114, pp. 136-37). 15. \"Unde Hipparcus dicit in libro de ordine intelligentiarum quod principes quidam demonum tenent quatuor partes sub celo. Nam expulsi de celo aerem occupant et quatuor elementa, nam equi­noctia et solsititia tenent in similitudinem primi thronf' Cecco, In sp heram mundi enarratio, 391. 16. Cecco explains several times that certain Intelligences, although evil, have a noble nature; thus the Intelligences of the four cardinal signs ( Oriens, Amaymon, Paymon, and Egim) have a noble na­ture, and this is why they like sacrifices. Ibid., 404. 17. May be an allusion to his Glasa super ymagines duodecim signorum Hermetis; see note 54 below (but note that several times the Glosa refers to the De occultis et manifestis, which therefore would seem to have been written first, though there are cross-references in both treatises; see Introduction).

I.e., the moon must be in conjunction or in \"application\" with one of the fiery signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), while this fiery sign \"receives\" the moon in a place within the zodiac, which is \"an essential dignity\" of the moon (domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term, decan); for a definition of \"recep­tion,\" see Jean-Patrice Boudet, Le recueil des plus celebres astrologues de Simon de Phares, 2 vols.

The astrologers, and especially the astrologer-magicians, are accustomed to speaking in an active way: when they \"put\" a planet in a specific astrological place, this means that they are waiting until the moment when this planet will be in such a place. This active verb expresses the astrologer's power to modify the course of things by his own actions. Cf. The bit, De imaginibus, in \"Ihe Astro nomi­cal Wo rks of 1habit ibn Qurra, ed. Francis J.

This distribution is found in Almadel, Vat. lat. 3180. 38. This section is obviously a misreading of Ptolemy's Liber quadripartiti, 1.8 (Venice: Boneto Locatelli, 1493), fol. 14rb, which actually says, \"Luna namque a sua prima corniculatione usque ad suam primam dicothomitatem humectat; et inde usque ad plenilunium c:alefacit; et inde usque ad dicothomitatem secundam desiccat; deinde usque quo occultetur et in directo Solis existat infrigidat:' 39.

This is a new formulation of the tripartite typology of images (or talismans) given in the Specu­lum astronomiae, chapter n, ed. and trans. Paola Zambelli, Stefano Caroti, Michela Pereira, and Ste­fano Zamponi (Pisa: Domus Galileana, 1977), reprinted with an English translation by Charles Burnett, Kristen Lippincott, David Pingree, and Paola Zambelli, The Speculum a.�tronomiae and Its Enigma: Astrology. Theology, and Science in Albertus Magnus and His Contemporaries, ed. Paola Zambelli et al. (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1992), 240, which makes the distinction between the \"abominable\" (or Hermetic) nigromantical images, the \"detestable\" (or Solomonic) nigromantical images, and the purely \"astro­logical images.\" See Introduction. (On the distinction between Hermetic and Solomonic images, see David Pingree, \"Learned Magic in the Time of Frederick II,\" Micrologus 2 [1994]: 39-56.) In the fifteenth century, authors such as Giorgio Anselmi da Parma, in his De magica disciplina (Firenze, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 44, Cod. 35, fols. u8v-n9r), and Jerome Torrella, in his Opus praeclarum de imaginibus a.�trologicis, ed. Nicolas Weill-Parot (I-1orence: Edizioni SISMEL del Galluzzo, 2008), 117-18, present a typology very similar to that of Antonio da Monto!mo. See Weill-Parot, \"A stral MagiC:' 43. A bodily conjunction is an astrological conjunction between two planets of zero degrees ex­actly, i.e., with no additional degree. 44. Making of astrological talismans in this way is close to what Thebit describes in De imaginibus, §VI, 188-90: \"Imago ad indinandum regem ad aliquem virorum.\" 45. The Latin text of this sentence seems quite obscure; the meaning that I suggest is highly hypothetical. 46. Note that the Magister Speculi, whose conception of purely \"astrological images\" is based entirely on a single text-the De imaginibus, ascribed to Thebit-that was clearly deprived of any \"addressative\" elements (rituals, invocations, inscriptions of characters, and other signs), faces the problem that within this text there are words said during the casting of the image against scorpions: \"haec est imago destructionis scorpionum a loco ilia quamdiu fuerit in eo imago servata.» Speculum"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"DE OCCULTIS ET MANIFESTIS 291 astronomiae, chapter 16, p. 270; cf.

Note that Cecco d'Ascoli, in his commentary on Alcabitius (Boffito, Commento inedito di Cecco, 43), associ­ates the image against flies in Pseudo-Ptolemy's Opus imaginum with the legend of Virgil concerning a talisman with a similar aim. so.

Hames In Florence, in November 1486, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola published his nine hundred Conclusiones cabalisticae, which he intended to defend publicly before the pope in Rome. As is well known, these Conclusiones were a series of propositions gathered from eclectic sources, such as the ancient Greek philoso­phers and their medieval commentators, and what Pico referred to as the prisca theologia, in which he included the Hermetica, Orphic and Chaldaean teachings, and also the Kabbalah. Pico hoped to show the harmony existing between all these different sources and how they served to illuminate the Christian faith. In the section dealing with what he referred to as the ancient Kabbalah, Pico sug­gested that the ars combinandi (combinatorial art) was identical to something he referred to as the alphabetaria revolutio (revolution ofletters), the latter being the highest level of speculative Kabbalah. In his Apologia, written in 1487 as a response to the papal commission ap­pointed to examine his Conclusiones, Pico explained that \"that which is called hohmat ha-zeruf [revolution or combination of letters] is a combinatory art and it is a method for gaining knowledge, and it is similar to that which we refer to as the ars Raymundi, although it proceeds in a very different manner:'1 Thus, the count of Mirandola became the first figure to suggest a similarity between the Kabbalah of the messianic pretender and founder of the school of ecstatic Kabbalah, Abraham Abulafia, and the Art of the medieval Christian philosopher, mystic, and missionary Ramon Llull. Some twelve years earlier, however, in July or August 1474 in Senigallia, a town on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, a translation into Hebrew was completed of the Ars brevis, a very popular work by Llull. Within a couple of years this translation had been copied a number of times, and from the colophon of one of these copies, it appears that this work was rated very highly by its Jewish readers as an aid for achieving mystical experience.2 Any interest shown by the adher-"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 295 ents of one faith in the texts of another is important for shedding light on com­mon intellectual interests and contacts, and this translation is of especially great significance in that there appears to have been in Italy in the fifteenth century a circle of Jewish scholars willingly engaging with a Christian effort in order to achieve divine illumination. Of even greater significance is that one of the schol­ars involved in this translation, Yohanan Alemanno, would become Pico della Mirandola's teacher, and that this translation would apply Abulafian ideas to the Lullian Art, creating the very symbiosis that would fascinate Pico a dozen years later. In a previous article, I situated this translation in the context of fifteenth­century humanism. Here, I would like to situate it in the slightly different con­text of the intercultural and interreligious ideas and practices revealed by other essays in this volume. A commonality may be seen on the one hand between Llull's own ideas and those of the Hebrew translator, and on the other between the interreligious view of truth characteristic of Lullism itself, and the kinds of syncretism involved in early fourteenth-century works like the Liber visionum of John of Morigny, and the Liber iuratus, as noted in chapters by Fanger, Mesler, and Veenstra in this volume.3 However, what is fascinating about this text is how, when translated from Latin into Hebrew, when it passes from Christianity to Judaism, it takes on new meanings very different from those intended by the original author. In the Middle Ages, the liberal arts were a means to an end for the study of philosophy, theology, law, or medicine; however, the quest for knowledge was also a goal of ritual texts, both Jewish and Christian. The search fo r knowledge as conveying a universal truth becomes increasingly a preoccupation of later fo urteenth-and fifteenth-century writers. In this period there was also an in­creasing emphasis on natural knowledge and intercultural knowledge as perti­nent to both personal salvation and the conversion of others. The intercultural interests of some thinkers provided resources whose lasting influence on West­ern culture is still being gauged and that became still more prominent in Renais­sance writings. In 1486, for example, Pico commissioned Flavius Mithridates (a converted Jew from Sicily) to translate a large library of the Jewish mystical works then available from Hebrew into Latin. These translations were clearly important to Pico, influencing seventy-two of his nine hundred conclusions, which pertained to or were argued from kabbalistic sources.4 Once translated into Latin, these texts were available to later Christian esoteric writers who also sought unified theories of knowledge and incorporated kabbalistic teachings into their work. It seems that it was in this context also that Jewish scholars discovered the works of Ramon Llull and undertook a Hebrew version of his Ars brevis."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"296 INVOKING ANGELS The renewed interest in Llull and his thought, particularly in Padua from the end of the fourteenth century, was part and parcel of the renewed deployment of these universalizing tendencies. Llull's Art provided a way to redefine man's relationship to God and creation. The Art, which placed man firmly within a dynamic conception of reality, was the framework with which Llull was certain he would be able to convince unbelievers of the truth of Christianity. The Art was also the basis for excursions into almost all the medieval fields of knowledge to show how everything was reducible to the most simple and general principle­God. In other words, the Art was a language whose grammar and syntax were the dynamic structure of creation, true knowledge of which revealed the inter­nal and eternal structure of the divine. Using general principles, conditions, and rules acceptable to all three monotheistic faiths, the artist would discover the inherent nature of the supreme being. According to Llull, the religion revealed to be truly compatible with this divinely inspired Art was Christianity. In other words, it is not that the other faiths were based on false premises but that they did not understand the language of reality totally. The disputation based on the framework of the Art would allow members of each faith to explore their own religious doctrines and those of the other fa iths and, by asking the right ques­tions, to reach the necessary conclusions. The first exposition of the \"form and method\" of the Art was the Ars compen­diosa inveniendi veritatem, or the Brief Art of Finding Truth, probably written in 1274. Prior to this, Llull had written the Libre de contemplaci6 en Deu, a mam­moth encyclopedic work in which Llull surveyed the whole of being, sensible and intelligible, human and divine, visible and invisible, and in which logical exposition was intermingled with ecstatic outcries of joy and happiness. In this work are to be found the seeds of all his later thought, but without the organi­zation and terminology th at provide the framework for disputation.5 The di­vine revelation on Mount Randa provided Llull with the tools for organizing his broad-ranging ideas into a coherent structure. This structure would be continu­ally redacted, refined, and improved upon over the next forty years, with the last redaction being the Ars generalis ultima, written 1305-8, along with its shorter and popular companion, the Ars brevis, completed in Pisa in 1308.6 Llull was well aware that questions regarding the nature of the divine and God's relation with creation were taxing the minds of his religious contemporaries. He fe lt certain that if Muslims and Jews could be convinced that the divine essence must be internally and eternally triune and that the incarnation was necessary, then they would have to admit the truth of Christianity and convert. Thus Llull based his Art on the fundamental belief of all three monotheistic faiths that there exists one God who is the cause of all th ings and who created the world. In the first stage, referred to as the \"quaternary phase;' the Art revolves around the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 297 figure A, a circle with a series of sixteen letters representing the divine attributes equally spaced around the circumference. Whether called dignitates, sefirot, or hadras, Llull proposed that all discussion start from these most general princi­ples, believed by all to exist in God in concordance and without any contrariety. Given that the world is created in the image of God, and playing on the Neo­platonic maxim bonum est diffusivum sui (good is diffusive of itself), Llull sug­gested that creation is a likeness of these perfect divine dignities. Each of the dignities has its effect in the world in accordance with the individual creature's capacity to receive the likeness of God and the degree of the creature's concor­dance with the dignities? Hence, all of being reflects the divine structure, and by demonstrating the structure of being, one will have knowledge of the divine. However, in the major revision and supposed simplification of the Art that started in 1290 with the Ars inventiva veritatis and culminated in the Ars brevis, referred to as the \"ternary phase'' of the Art, this figure took on a new fo rm that made it more general and applicable to all areas of knowledge. The components of the \"first figure,\" as Llull calls it, are referred to as \"principles\" rather than dignities, and God is no longer the central fo cus of this figure but becomes one of the nine subjects of the Art, which can be examined using the principles of this figure. Thus the principles of this figure can now be used to examine every­thing fr om the most general, perfect, and sublime being, i.e., God, to the most particular aspects of the creation.8 In this way Llull allowed the practitioner of the Art to explore the whole of creation using the combinatorial method, which, through asking questions, fo llowing the basic rules, and using the general prin­ciples, allows conclusions to be reached about the nature of God and the par­ticulars of creation. Using what Llull refers to as \"necessary reason;' which is the fo rm of the Art, it is possible to descend from the most general principle, God, to the most par­ticular, or to ascend from the most particular to that most general principle. Thus nature or creation becomes a scala, a ladder of being, by which man could ascend from sense to rational knowledge and from rational knowledge to the discovery of \"the supreme being in whom all the divine names coincide or fa ll together:'9 Whereas in the quaternary phase of the Art the other figures of the Art, and particularly figure T, allow the intellect to examine multifarious prop­ositions, affirming or negating them using the different elements of creation as metaphors or analogies, in the \"ternary phase\" the concepts of figure T are ar­chetypal fo rms from which can be derived the status of the question or issue being considered in relation to other things, or within a single being as well. What emerges, however, is that the intellect re alizes that the dynamic activity of the principles in creation can only be understood in a triune structure, and what is true of creation must be true of God. The mature fo rm of this thought is"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"298 INVOKING ANGELS referred to as the theory of the correlatives of action. Thus, even if this is not spelled out in detail in the Ars brevis (because Llull wanted it to be general and acceptable to members of all faiths), it is there implicitly and is the conclusion reached if one uses the Art properly}0 In addition, Llull's understanding of the incarnation was appealing because he viewed the incarnation as necessary, willed by God in order to achieve total concord with creation-in contrast to medieval thought, which held that the incarnation was necessary only because of man's flawed nature. Christ-in whom human and divine nature are conjoined-is, according to Llull, the bond hold­ing creation together. By knowing his own intrinsic dynamism and by turning away from all external contingent activity, man will be able to attain the highest degree of contemplation. In other words, Llull's thought supported man's poten­tial to ascend the ladder ofbeing and, through Christ, to bridge the gulf between finite and infinite.U This natural theology was attractive to many thinkers of the fifteenth century, especially in Padua, a university town otherwise known as a center of Scholastic Aristotelianism and Averroism. Nicholas of Cusa spent six years at Padua (1417-23) and adopted many of Llull's conceptions and ideas, incorporating them into his broader Platonic and Neoplatonic speculationsP During the 1450s, Lullism made great strides in the city, thanks to the support of the local bishop, Fantini Dandolo (1448-59). Dandolo gave patronage to Lullists such as Joan Bolons of Barcelona, who completed a lecture on the Ars generalis in his house and who was in touch with Nicholas of Cusa.D The library of the Ve netian doctor Nicho­las Pol and the work of the Franciscan Joan Ros from Valencia are indications of the considerable amount of Lullian activity in Padua.14 In addition, there are impressive collections of Llull's works in the Marciana in Venice, and in Padua itself, dating to the fo urteenth century.15 It was probably in Padua that the celebrated Jewish Renaissance scholar Yo­hanan Alemanno (1435-1503!1504) came across Llull'sArs brevis, though it seems that none of the extant Latin manuscripts are the source of the Hebrew transla­tion.16 Alemanno was a nomadic scholar of a Neoplatonic bent who is best known as one ofPico della Mirandola's teachers in Jewish matters (along with Elijah del Medigo and the convert Flavius Mithridates, mentioned above)F Alemanno spent a number of years during the 1460s in Padua studying medicine, among other things, and was awarded his doctoral degree there by Judah Messer Leon in 14 70.18 Alemanno, whose writings indicate his broad intellectual interests and syncretism, would have fo und much to interest him in Padua beyond the study of medicine. His notebook. which consists of materials he copied, translated, and commented on over a thirty-year period, deals with a variety of subjects,"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 299 among them moral and political philosophy, Kabbalah, and magic.19 It is the conception of man's potential to ascend to and descend from the divine via na­ture or creation that probably attracted Alemanno and other Jewish thinkers to Llull in general, and to the Ars brevis in particular. 20 Let us leave Alemanno and Padua for a moment and turn to the colophon of the Hebrew translation, which is of great interest as it gives us some indication of the importance attached by this circle to Llull's Ars brevis. To thank, praise, and honor the blessed and exalted Lord who has helped me to finish this famous wisdom. Raimundus completed [hishlim] this book in the town ofSenigallia in the month of Ab, in the year 5234 [July­August 1474]. This time, as well, I will give thanks to God, who held my right hand, and who aided me with his support, and in his benevolence made me successful, and who helped me with his aid and support to ascend Hor ha-Har (Num. 20:23-29; Deut. 32:50), mountain upon mountain, until at­taining the peak of thirteen mountains. And in them I found very sharp brambles (Prov. 24:31), thorns {Song of Sol. 2:2), and briars {Judg. 8:7, 17), and holes, pits, and caves and deep wells down to the bottomless hell (Deut. 32:22). And fortified hewn rocks going above the vault [firmament] of heaven (rakia ha-shamayim-Gen. 1:14, 15, 17, 20, perhaps also Ezek. 1:22, 23) and beyond to the strong tower (migdal oz).21 I will thank and bow down [to him] who led me through all this and I arrived at the fruit of my labor, I took the trouble and I found [him]. And I completed the copying of this work-short in quantity but great in quality-today, Friday, of the weekly portion \"and behold a ladder po­sitioned on the ground and its top reaches to the heavens\" (Gen. 28:12), 8 of Kislev in the year 5235 [November 28, 1474], a full hundred years after its composition. And I was on the shores of the Adriatic Sea in the town of Senigallia, which is on the River Niola. Signed by the youngest of the dis­ciples of the French doctors, Pinhas Tzvi, son of Nethanel from Vaison called Abin Abat ibn Tura Hafetz Hazak. 22 I copied this book of Raimundus at the side of my teacher, the scholar, guide for the perplexed, Maestro Pinhas the doctor, may God protect and preserve him, here in Senigallia in the month oflyar, in the year 236 [May 7-12, 1476], the weekly portion \"for it is a day of atonement\" (Lev. 23:28). May the Lord, blessed be he in his mercy, give me and my seed to the end of days the merit to study it. In strength, the copyist Joseph, the son of Nehemiah Foah ofblessed memory.23"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"300 INVOKING ANGELS As the colophon indicates, this manuscript is a copy made by Joseph Foah, the disciple of one Pinhas Tzvi. Tzvi himself copied this work in November 1474 from a translation made in Senigallia in the March of Ancona, in July or August of the same year. Pinhas Tzvi was probably a disciple of Alemanno, having studied with him in Mantua, and other works copied by Pinhas and his disciple Joseph, dealing with astrology, astronomy, the making of astrolabes, and logic extant in other manuscripts, attest to a close relationship.24 In his aforemen­tioned notebooks, Alemanno compiled a system of education based on seven­year cycles, and for each of the cycles he recommended the subjects and some of the books to be perused. In each cycle, the material to be studied goes hand in hand with the intellectual and spiritual attainment of the student, the aim being to attain divine revelation at the age ofthirty-five.25 In the second of these seven­year cycles, Alemanno recommends studying astrology and astronomy, men­tioning the works copied in these manuscripts, and also recommends learning how to use an astrolabe. These, together with other things, are considered neces­sary preparation for the study of philosophy. Pinhas, who copied the original translation of the Ars brevis within months of its being carried out, perceived the work as an important tool fo r ascending into the divine presence. His terminology conjures up images of mystical specu­lation and ecstasy using biblical motif.o;. The theme of ascending to the divine is reiterated a number of times: the allusion to God aiding the ascent into the di­vine world, the mountain imagery, and the verse from the weekly Torah portion (Gen. 28:12), which Pinhas chose, not by chance, to indicate when he completed the copying. Even Joseph, the scribe and disciple of Pinhas, indicates through his choice of a verse from the weekly portion of the law (Lev. 23:28) the mystical applications of this work. In the Jewish liturgical year, man is never as close to God as he is on the Day of Atonement, when the gates of repentance open to one and all. Joseph purposefully chose a verse from the middle of the weekly portion rather than the beginning, as was common procedure, because it complemented the possibilities inherent in the work. Looking more closely at what Pinhas wrote, the imagery indicates a desire fo r spiritual death through mors osculi, or the divine kiss of death.26 The ascent of Hor ha-Har, the mountain on whose peak, according to the Torah and as later interpreted by the rabbis, Aaron died by the kiss of God (the thirteen peaks that are ascended corresponding to the thirteen parts of the Ars brevis), the use of terminology from the Song of Songs, and the ladder of ascent and descent from Jacob's dream all point to the desire to achieve that divine kiss.27 The use of sefirotic imagery to describe the ascent beyond the \"vault of heaven -rakia ha-shamayim\" (which is ascribed to the tenth sefirah-Malchut) to the"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 301 \"strong tower-migdal oz\" (which refers to the sixth sefirah-Tiferet) also points toward that desire. The wish to receive the divine kiss and its implication as the perfect cleaving to God, which, however, can take place only after death, is a central motif in the writings ofYohanan Alemanno. In The Ascent of Solomon-his introduction to the commentary on Song of Songs-Alemanno claims that the song was written by King Solomon to guide others toward the levels of perfection and felicity that he achieved. Commenting on the second verse of the song- \"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth\" -Alemanno writes that this refers to \"all of [Solo­mon's] desire to be attached [to God], and on this he built this the song in its entirety:'28 This work, which was written under the auspices of Pico della Mi­randola in Florence in 1488, is important, because, Alemanno writes, \"I have, for twenty years, delayed writing this book about the Song of Songs. The most important reason fo r this delay was that I had not satisfactorily explained how the literal sense of the biblical book conformed to its profound sense:'29 Twenty years means that Alemanno was pondering these matters while he was in Padua, at the time that he probably first came across the Ars brevis, and while it was being translated into Hebrew in Senigallia. There is good reason to suggest that Alemanno's understanding of Llull's view of man and his ability to comprehend Llull's Art helped him fo rmulate his ideas as they appear in this commentary on the Song of Songs. The whole of Alemanno's Ascent is aimed at showing that Solomon was wise in all aspects of human knowledge and endeavor. Solomon knew all the secrets of the Egyptians; he knew the sciences of divination, augury, alchemy, and magic as well as political theory, natural sciences, and music. He was the perfect human being, in that he achieved the ultimate attachment to God while still alive. Since Alemanno portrays Solomon as possessor of all the branches of knowledge with which his contemporaries were concerned, Solomon is clearly the Jewish answer to the claims made by Marsilio Ficino and others for Hermes, Zoroaster, Plato, and Aristotle. 30 At the same time, the fa ct that Solomon does not appear in these lists of canonical authors' names among the Christian philosophers may be com­plicated by the frequent attribution of so many known works of ritual magic to Solomon in the medieval period. Thus Alemanno may have been helpful in turn to the Christian writers who knew him by offering another mystical and kab­balistic context for Solomon's knowledge, playing to both Jewish and Christian traditions of Solomon the magician, but perhaps allowing some detachment from its less savory medieval associations.31 According to the Heshek Shlomo (The Desire of Solomon), Alemanno's com­mentary on the Song of Songs, there are two types of divine kiss, one of which"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"302 INVOKING ANGELS can be achieved while body and soul are conjoined, while the second is achiev­able only after or at the time of physical death. The first is like death, in that the soul cleaves with passionate love and desire to the divine, but because of bodily limitations this cleaving is only temporary. The second is that which Moses, Aaron, and Miriam experienced through the act of death by divine kiss, an eter­nal cleaving to God.32 There are seven levels of mystical love and three progres­sive stages for receiving the divine kiss, which prepare the person to move from the material world into the spiritual world. They start with the sefirah Malchut. Malchut, or kingship, the tenth in the hierarchy of the st:firot-the revealed ema­nations of the godhead according to kabbalistic theosophy-receives the divine influx from all the other nine sefirot and is linearly connected with Keter, the first sefirah, Tiferet, the sixth, and Ye sod, the ninth sefirah. According to Ale­manna, Tiferet (glory) is the most central of the sefirot in that it receives from both above and below, and in that, therefore, the goal of the lover is to cleave to this sefirah. Most true lovers of the divine, like the forefathers and the prophets, only managed, while alive, to enter the \"Gate of Heaven:' as Alemanno refers to it, to be attached to the last of the sefirot, Malchut. 33 Even though this attachment is not permanent and lasting, it allows the lover to draw down spiritual forces for the performance of astral magic, such as foretelling the future and the prepa­ration of talismans. According to Alemanno, however, two persons achieved the second and higher level of divine kiss while still alive, Moses and Solomon. Aleman no shows that Moses, by speaking face to face to God on Sinai, experienced and remained permanently in a state of ecstatic death, cleaving to the sefirah of Tiferet even while alive. 34 Solomon, who received his knowledge from both Enoch and Moses, was, with his great wisdom and spiritual abilities, also able to cleave to Tiferet. With Solomon, however, the divine kiss took place twice, and only the second occasion was permanent, continuing after death. It was on this second occasion of receiving the kiss of God that Solomon composed the Song of Songs. Solo­mon represents, fo r Alemanno, the human who received both kisses of God (one while alive and another at death), and thus he represents a man of knowl­edge, virtue, and dignity, a pinnacle for emulation. But Solomon is also the supreme magician, as becomes clear from his const ruction of the temple in Je­rusalem. Solomon sought to make the temple a microcosm (olam katan) that imitated the macrocosm (olam gadol) and thereby to draw down the shekinah, the divine presence. As God created the macrocosm in seven days, Solomon brought forth his microcosm in seven years.35 This magical aspect becomes clear in Alemanno's comparison of Solomon with Moses. Moses is considered perfect, in contrast with Solomon, who sinned, for example, in seeking the impure knowledge of the alien gods of his wives."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 3 0 3 However, Alemanno writes, \"doubtless Moses knew better than anyone how the observance of the commandments in the Torah and the avoidance of the prohibitions of the Torah would benefit the Israelite people .... Among the na­tions, however, Balaam resembled him [Solomon] in the cognate knowledge of spiritual forces available to the gentiles. It was in this knowledge that Solomon surpassed Moses .... Solomon tried to understand the customs and cults of the nations. In contrast, Moses sought only to preserve his powers of receiving in­fluence through Tiferet, the commandments of the Torah.\"36 Solomon is, therefore, the exemplum to be followed by Jews wishing to attach themselves to the divine, in the same manner that Christ is the archetype for Christians. Thus, while Llull and his quattrocento fo llowers in Padua emphasized the place of Christ at the center of creation, expressing the union between the divine and human natures, Solomon fulfills this purpose for Alemanno and his circle.37 Moreover, Solomon's example justifies turning to external sources in order to enhance and aid the ascent to the divine. 38 His knowledge (like Ale­manna's) is interculturally derived. To Alemanno and his circle, however, this level of achievement also implies inducing the descent of spiritual fo rces or the divine overflow fo r magical pur­poses.39 For Alemanno, the highest levels of man's development are achieved through the study first of sefirotic or theosophical Kabbalah, then of ecstatic or Abulafian Kabbalah and magical works.40 These allow the adept to cleave to God and also to perform magical feats through drawing down the divine influx. In his study curriculum, Alemanno enumerates a number of books on magic to be studied during the cycle of seven years devoted to the most advanced studies from age twenty-eightto thirty-five. During these years, writes Alemanno, \" [man] should be less concerned with material matters and should weaken his external powers while strengthening his internal powers and figures, to imagine the spir­itual world whose beginnings are the abstract material forms:'41 This is reminis­cent of Llull's use of figures in the Ars brevis, whose purpose is to lead the intel­lect up from the particular to the general, and if Alemanno was studying Llull while in Padua, this would fit the time scale in his life fo r the study of works with magical potential.42 Indeed, most of the magical works Alemanno recommends are not of Jewish origin but are of prime importance because, in his view, they have preserved, unlike most Jewish magical works, the true magic whose source is Solomon.43 Here we are presented with a further reason for the importance ofLlull's work for Alemanno, in that the Ars brevis also has magical potential that allows the artist not only to ascend but also to harness and draw down the divine presence. According to the structure of the Ars brevis, by following \"general principles and conditions,\" and by understanding the alphabet and the manipulation of the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"304 INVOKING ANGELS fo ur figures, man's intellect has a ladder for ascent from particulars of creation and the physical world to the completely general, which is the perfection of the divine dignities in God. The manipulation of the figures through the combi­nation of letters allows the intellect to ascend to the greatest good but also to descend to particular goods. But here we find a significant divergence from the original intention of the use of the letters in Llull's Art, and something that can be understood only when we understand that Alemanno and his circle read the Ars brevis through an Abulafian prism. Abraham Abulafia, an important kabbalist and contemporary of Llull, was born in late 1239, which corresponded to the year 5000 in the Hebrew calendar, the start of the sixth millennium-a year of apocalyptic expectation in some Jew­ish circles-and, according to him, the year of the renewal of prophecy. Awak­ened by the spirit of the Lord when he was twenty years old, Abulafia set out to find the mythical Sambation River, where he presumably hoped to find the lost ten tribes. Growing up in a world worried by the onslaught of the Mongols, and possibly considering them connected to the lost tribes, this voyage to the Holy Land clearly had apocalyptic undertones. Unable to proceed beyond Acre be­cause of the battle of En Jalut between the Mamluks and the Mongols, which effectively ended the Mongol threat to the West, anyway, Abulafia returned to Greece, southern Italy, and then Catalonia, where he studied and taught Mai­monides's Guide fo r the Perplexed and acquired an extensive knowledge of se­firotic Kabbalah and the teachings of the Ashkenazi pietists. Following a revela­tion in late 1270, and on the basis of his earlier studies, Abulafia started to develop his teachings based on Sefe r Ye tzirah, a mystical understanding of the Guide and a particular (re)reading of the scriptures. Toward the end of 1276, Abulafia re­ceived a further vision that inspired him to believe that he was the expected messiah. This was the backdrop for his extensive messianic and apocalyptic ac­tivity and writings in the fo llowing years. Intensive preparation and further vi­sions led to Abulafia's attempt to preach to Pope Nicholas III in 1280. Abulafia's messianic activity continued till late 1285, when another revelation caused him to see things in a different light. Although the apocalyptic elements remain in the buildup toward 1290, which he strongly believed was the year of redemption, his messianic claims, while present, are more subdued and seem to indicate a realization that his messianic potential would come to fruition only at the end of times. Abu1afia fa ced considerable opposition to his prophetic and messianic claims from within the Jewish world, spearheaded by a campaign led by the Catalan rabbinic authority Solomon ibn Adret, and wrote a number of vituper­ative letters defending his claims. It is perhaps no coincidence that Abulafia bowed off the historical stage in late 1290 or early 1291, although what exactly happened to him remains a mystery.44"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 305 Abulafia's kabbalistic teachings, which developed out of his apocalyptic­messianic context, took on a life of their own. For Abulafia, the Torah is the names of God, and the letters themselves have mystical and magical potential. Through the combination of and meditation on the letters, one can not only attain \"deve­kut (a cleaving to the divine) and the kiss\" but also harness and bring down the divine influx from the sefirotic world.45 Alemanno and his circle, and subse­quently also Pico della Mirandola, read Abulafia's understanding of the power of the letters into Llulls's ars combinatoria as it appears in the Ars brevis. In the Ars brevis we find the following statement about the purpose of the letter notation: \"we have employed an alphabet in this Art so that it can be used to make figures, as well as to mix principles and rules for the purpose of inves­tigating the truth. For, as a result of any one Jetter having many meanings, the intellect becomes more general in its reception of the things signified, as well as acquiring knowledge:' The letters are signifiers and have no special inherent meaning in themselves; they are just tools to help the artist progress toward knowledge, to help the intellect become more general. And therefore, Llull con­tinues, \"this alphabet must be learned by heart, for otherwise the artist will not be able to make proper use of this Art:' The Hebrew translation, however, reads as follows: \"The alphabet that we have employed in this work is that with which we can make figures and know all the mixtures. And its combinations [harkaba­an Abulafian term}, in both the principles and the rules, are to investigate the truth that is in one letter; we will receive many significations, and great under­standing, to receive many and great teachings and to acquire wisdom. And one needs to know this alphabet in one's heart and in one's mind, and on the joints of one's fingers. For without this, the scholar will be unable to proceed in this work:'46 The difference is dear. For the students of the Hebrew Ars brevis, the knowledge of the combination of the letters of the alphabet itself is what gives wisdom; the letters are not just signifiers fo r other terms in the figures; they are significations themselves that allow the scholar to achieve true knowledge. The translator invokes Abulafia's method of proceeding from the actual writing of the letters, to visualizing them, and then to knowing them as divine emanations. 47 This understanding of Llull's work places the emphasis both on man's ascent to the divine and on the drawing down of the divine influx through the powers inherent in the combinations of the letters. 48 The letters, rather than just being a short method of referring to the terms ofLiull's Art, become magical in their own right. This use of the Art is reflected in Alemanno's discussion of the ultimate good at the end of his Song of Solomon's Ascent. Man is the center of creation, the place of meeting between the physical and the spiritual. He is a microcosm, the reason for creation, and contains within himself everything in perfection. The attainment of the ultimate good is the desire of the soul, which it can achieve"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"306 INVOKING ANGELS by ascending the seven spiritual stages that are parallel to seven stages in the material world. Each rung, in both the physical and the spiritual realms, is sub­ordinate to the next one on the ladder and contains a degree of goodness that exists in totality and perfection on the seventh and highest level of the spiritual realm. In other words, as in the Ars brevis, where perfect goodness is to be found on the highest rung of the ladder though its imprint is on every one of the rungs to a lesser degree, so too for Alemanno. The last two stages are in the sefirotic world, Malchut being the sixth and Tiferet the seventh and ultimate, which is the complete and total unity. Only Moses and Solomon were able to attain the level of Tiferet and, fr om there, to access and cleave to the divine influx. However, with the right preparation (a large part of which is the correct performance of the commandments and rituals) the soul can, writes Alemanno, \"receive and cleave to the pure and spiritual powers which descend from the sefirotic world:'49 Thus, for Alemanno and his disciples in Senigallia, Llull's work, \"short in quantity but great in quality;' incorporated elements of the prisca theologia as known to Solomon. This is probably what attracted Alemanno to Llull's works and teachings in Padua and occasioned the translation of the Ars brevis into Hebrew. The centrality of man in Llull's system, the emphasis on man's ability to ascend through nature to the divine world, as well as the magical potential inherent in the letter combinations of the work, are surely what rendered Llull's work so useful to this Jewish circle's syncretistic approach of seeking support for ancient Jewish wisdom in Christian sources. Pico's division of Kabbalah into two disciplines, that of the sefirot and that of the shemot (divine names), has puzzled scholars, as Pico sees the sefirot as part of practical Kabbalah, whereas the knowledge of the divine names is attributed to speculative Kabbalah. The opposite would seem to make more sense and is more commensurate with Jewish divisions of Kabbalah, where knowledge of the divine names is part and parcel of ecstatic Kabbalah and sefirotic Kabbalah is more speculative. Pico also writes, \"I divide the speculative part of the Cabala [the science of the names] four ways .... The first science is what I call the alpha­betariae revolutionis (that of revolution of the alphabet).\"50 However, this divi­sion, along with the comment in the Apologia with which this chapter opened, makes perfect sense when seen in light of the Hebrew translation of the Ars brevis and its bringing together of the Abulafian fo cus on the divine names and the Lullian Ars. While it is probable that Pico only met Alemanno in person in 1488, it is possible that Alemanno, who was so central to Fico's knowledge of Kabbalah, and to his equation of it with magic through his circle's translation of the Ars brevis, was also instrumental in Pico's conjoining of Llull's ars combi­nandi with Abulafia's Kabbalah. 51"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"NOTES BETWEEN ANCONA AND FLORENCE 307 1.

In \"Jewish Magic with a Christian Text; I suggested that the manuscript used by the translator was Vaticano ( Citta del), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Chigi A IV: 105, from the fifteenth century. This manuscript came into the hands of one Johannes de Ulma, who was at Padua and got a doctorate at the university in 1444. This supposition was supported by the fact that the Hebrew translation seemed to follow the Latin of the manuscripts in this stemma, and that this manuscript is the only one of this group that has figures (like the Hebrew manuscript) and can be placed in Padua. Further de­tailed study of the Hebrew manuscript, however, particularly the layout of the alphabet in the first section of the Ars brevis, suggests that a manuscript now in Wolfenbiittel, Herzog August Bibliothek (Cod. 4180) was a possible source. The Ars brevis is to be found on fols. 239r-25ov. The manuscript has different scribes, but on fo l. 21ov, ai: the end of the Ta ula general, there is the following: \"Scriptum est hoc opus per me Iohannem a. D. 1445 incompleto, in meridie diei s. Poli[carpi?],\" and on fol. 283r, at the end of the Disputatio quinque hominum sapientium: \"Scriptum a. D. 1442 in sabbato, scilicet in die Michaelis archangeli:' It is thus possible that this is the same Johannes who purchased a manuscript containing the Ars brevis in Padua, and who copied the work, along with other Lullian works in this manuscript, which is dearly a compilation put together at a later date. Yet there is a further complica­tion. Some of the readings in the Hebrew translation are closer to manuscripts such as Oxford, Corpus Christi, 247, also from the fifteenth century, e.g., in the second triangle of figure T (fol. 2r), where the Hebrew has an additional sentence-\"In the first letter, there are three species which are cause, quan­tity and time\" -found only in this and two other manuscripts. But the setting out of the alphabet in these manuscripts does not match the Hebrew text. For an analysis of the manuscript tradition of the Ars brevis, see Raimundi Lulli opera latina XII, ed. Aloisius Madre, CCCM 38 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1984),176-81; fo r a description of the manuscripts, see x-xliii. Even if Alemanno did not see the manu­script in Padua, the colophon of the Hebrew translation demonstrates his importance for the group of scholars studying the Ars brevis.

In the Heshek Shlomo, he talks about the \"new spirit-ruah hadashah\" in the man trying to cleave to the divine.

Wo!fSon The Christian Kabbalah expounded by Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522) has been the subject of an impressive number of scholarly studies.1 In this chapter, I inves­tigate an aspect of his intellectual and spiritual-one might say inspirational­project that has not, in my judgment, received adequate attention, to wit, his appropriation and reinscription of the theurgical explication of ritual, a central component of the Jewish esoteric tradition fr om its inception. 2 Beyond the par­ticular case of Reuchlin, an analysis of this theme may shed light on a some­what neglected dimension of the attraction ofkabbalistic tradition for Christian thinkers, philosophers, and theologians in the Renaissance, a powerful force that continued to reverberate and inform the cultural-literary history of the West until today. 3 To cast my argument in bold relief, let me begin by mentioning Moshe !del's suggestion that the \"basic change that the theosophical Kabbalah underwent in the Christian presentation is the obliteration of the theurgical nature of this mystical lore:' Whereas the \"core of the theosophical Jewish Kabbalah'' is predi­cated on the preswned affinity between human activity-or, to be more precise, the perfo rmance of commandments on the part of the Jews-and the nature of the divine world, Christian Kabbalah \"is not so much a way to experience reality and to explain the meaning ofhwnan action ... but much more a kind of gnosis­a collection of concepts explaining the map of the divine world:'4 Given Chris­tian antipathy to Jewish ritual through the ages, this is surely a reasonable and defensible claim, but the matter nonetheless demands careful scrutiny, if for no other reason then at least on account of the fa ct that theurgy was understood to be an integral part of ancient Hermeticism,5 a teaching/practice, a path, con­gruent with kabbalistic lore in the syncretistic minds of Renaissance Christian kabbalists. 6"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 313 In support of this point, it should be recalled that, according to the taxonomy of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494), articulated in the first of the seventy-one Conclusiones cabalisticae, in great measure indebted to the dis­tinction used by the thirteenth-century kabbalist Abraham Abulafia between qabbalat ha-se.firot and qabbalat ha-shemot,7 Jewish esoteric wisdom-in Pico's terminology the \"science of Kabbalah\" (scientiam Cabale)-comprises two parts, speculative and practical, the doctrine of the ten luminous emanations and the art of combining letters that make up the names of God.8 Commenting on this, Chaim Wirszubski wisely remarked that it is not surprising \"that Pico related practical Kabala to metaphysics and theology: the connection between theurgy and theology is almost as old as Neoplatonism itself, not excluding Christian Neoplatonism:'9 Pentagram and the Mystery of Incarnation The influence of Pico's linking magia naturalis and Kabbalah10 is patently dis­cernible in Reuchlin.U Indeed, in Reuchlin's first philosophical work, De verbo miri.fico, published in 1494, a trialogue between the Epicurean Sidonius, the Jew Baruchias, and the Christian Capnion, he offers a prisca theologia predicated on the assumption that the secrets cultivated by Jews relate to the inner power of divine names, a power that derives from the unique status of Hebrew as the ori­gin of all languages.12 In the opening letter of the treatise, Reuchlin declares that his task is \"to elucidate the occult property of names; and so from these, and from such numerous and great names, the occasion of our finally choosing one supreme, wonder-working and blessed name may the more easily present it­self:'13 The \"wonder-working word\" alluded to in the title is not the tetragram­maton, the shem ha-mefo rash, as Jewish kabbalists unanimously would presume, but the pentagrammaton, the four letters of the name, YHWH, with the shin inserted in the middle, vocalized as Ye hoshua, the mystical name of Jesus. To be sure, Baruchias ascribes extraordinary power to the tetragrammaton, the most potent of divine names disclosed by God to Moses; this name, which Sidonius compares to the Pythagorean tetractys, 14 contains the vitality of all things, the divine beneficence that bestows light on the variegated life forms of our world; hence one who learns how to utter it in prayer can perform miraculous things that supersede the natural order. In effect, recitation of the name-with proper mystical intent-affords one the opportunity to emulate God, who alone was the \"founder and teacher of this impossible pronunciation\" (\"idem quoque impos­sibilis pronunciationis institutor et praeceptor est\"). The revelation of the name YHWH to Moses thus endowed humanity with the capacity to become divine.15"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"314 INVOKING ANGELS It is, however, the name YHSWH, discussed at length in the third book, that discloses the unique standpoint of Christian Kabbalah. Apparently inspired by Pico's reflections in the fourteenth and fifteenth theses of the Conclusiones caba­listicae on the name of Jesus (nomen Iesu) and the name of Messiah (nomen messiae),16 the former described as revealed and the latter as concealed,17 Reuch­lin notes that by adding shin to YHWH, the ineffable is rendered audible. Inas­much as this letter signifies the Son of God, 18 it may be further adduced that the pentagrammaton instructs one about the mystery of incarnation; the liturgical utterance of the ineffable name-a paradoxical and absurd gesture, indeed, the impossible gesture, the gesture of impossibility-points to the miracle of tran­substantiation of the word made flesh, the ultimate mystery of faith, the secret of the (non)phenomenalizable phenomenon of the secret.l9 The onomastic dis­tinction is rendered typologically, in line with a long trajectory of Christo logical exegesis: YHWH is linked to the covenant of Moses and YHSWH to the new covenant. 20 The critical point for the purposes of this study is to note that Reuch­lin, already in his early work, closely following the approach of Pico, affirmed an intricate connection between Kabbalah and a theurgical conception of the di­vine name. Precisely this knowledge privileged the Jewish mystical tradition as the most sublime articulation of occult philosophy,21 combining contemplation and magic, a synthesis that made it possible for Reuchlin (and, by implication, other Christian believers) to embrace the ritual efficacy of Kabbalah even while upholding the long-standing rejection of rabbinic law on the part of the church as an effective means for atonement and deliverance.22 Theurgy, Salvation, and the Art of Kabbalah Reuchlin elaborates the theurgical aspect of Kabbalah in his more mature trea­tise De arte cabalistica. A passage in the concluding section of the first book is especially noteworthy: Reuchlin remarks that the kabbalist's \"intimate friend­ship with the angels\" affords him the opportunity to learn about the divine names in order to perform miracles. On account of these wondrous deeds, \"spiteful cynics\" have wrongly called kabbalists \"sly magicians:'23 Reuchlin is quick to point out, however, that the \"skills of Kabbalah tend to work for the good of m�m. while the poison of false magic leads to their downfall. The one employs the names of ghosts and evil spirits, the other uses the names of light and the blessed angels:'24 The discussion ends abruptly, as the Jewish interlocutor does not want to betray his \"kabbalistic creed\" by unearthing matters on Sabbath pertaining to Sabbatai, that is, Saturn, the \"highest secret mystery:'25"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 3 15 The reference to gnosis about Saturn imparting the \"highest secret mystery;' and the connection Reuchlin makes between it and Sabbath, are surely deserv­ing of explication, 26 but what is especially important to point out fo r the limited scope of my analysis is the centrality of the theurgical dimension in Reuchlin's understanding of the art of Kabbalah. In spite of his unwavering rejection of the nomian approach to salvation of the soul, in the aforementioned passage Reuch­lin is careful to portray the Jewish exponent of the mystical knowledge as one who would not dishonor the Sabbath by explicating occult matters. This is all the more surprising given the emphasis Reuchlin places on the theurgical effi­cacy of the divine names as a vital component of Kabbalah. As he puts it quite early on in the trialogue, cleverly transforming an older motif attested in Jewish mystical sources regarding the transmission of esoteric knowledge to Adam from the angel Raziel,27 the \"first Kabbalah\" (prima Cabala), the \"highest and most holy revelation\" that \"encapsulates all the principles of Kabbalah, all the traditions concerning the divine, knowledge of heaven, visions of the prophets, and meditations of the blessed;' is contained in Raziel's \"announcement of pri­mordial salvation\" {primordialis salutis nuncia) to notify Adam that the trans­gression of eating from the Tree of Knowledge would be rectified by the fruit of the Tree of Life's being bestowed upon humankind by the \"man of peace;' whose name contains the letters YHWH, an obvious allusion to Jesus, whose name in Hebrew can be spelled as YHSWH, a theme to which I have already referred.28 In another passage, Reuchlin relates to th is tradition more explicitly when he notes that the proper name of the Messiah consists of the \"four holy letters by which, as with marks and symbols, the ineffable is represented, together with the consonant shin, the way the ineffable is named. (In Kabbalah it is common to explain shin by Notaricon as standing for shem yhwh niqra,29 that is, 'The inef­fable is called YHWH:)\"30 I shall return to the Christological implications of this characterization of Kabbalah as a doctrine of salvation that reverses the import of original sin, but suffice it to say at this juncture that, in Reuchlin's mind, Kabbalah is connected essentially to gnosis of the pentagram, which has both contemplative and theur­gical dimensions; that is, knowledge of the name is the means by which the soul separates from the body and becomes angelic, an angelification that in turn fa­cilitates the performance of miracles that exceed the empirical confines of na­ture; the ultimate goal of Kabbalah is to provide a path that leads to liberation from the imprisonment of the soul in corporeal materiality, which thereby occa­sions the allegorical/spiritual realization of the mystery of incarnation.

They believe that they have much the best pronunciation of the Name of the Tetragrammaton in the name of YHSWH, the true Messiah:'31 Theurgy, for Reuchlin, is expressive of an incarnational eschatology whose mean­ing is explicable only on the basis of knowledge of the mysteries of the law cul­tivated by kabbalists.32 In the remainder of this study, I explore the complex reinscription of the theurgical orientation, inextricably bound to the notion of the mysteries of the law (sitrei torah), in a system of thought that is on the face of it unambiguously hostile to the law and the ceremonial dimension of Judaism. The particular van­tage point from which I examine this theme in Reuchlin's thinking is his adapta­tion of a fundamental tenet of kabbalists regarding the nexus between language and secrecy. Prophetic Visualization and Contemplative Ascesis In De arte cabalistica, Reuchlin presents Simon ben Eleazar (identified as a mem­ber of the family of Simeon ben Yobai, the master of the imaginary fraternity depicted in zoharic literature)33 as the Jewish sage who imparts the ancient wis­dom of Kabbalah to his fe llow disputants, Philolaus the Pythagorean philosopher and Marranus the Muslim. In Reuchlin's view, the ultimate importance of Judaism lies in its preservation of the archaic wisdom that contains the theological truths of Christianity. In this matter Reuchlin adopts the hermeneutical axiom formu­lated by Pica, his mentor in matters of Jewish esotericism: the main theological tenets of Christianity are to be found in kabbalistic lore and thus, as a matter of polemical stratagem, the theological error of the Jews can be demonstrated from their own literary legacy.34 Following Pico, moreover, as well as other late fifteenth­century Florentine Platonists, such as Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), Reuchlin's reconstruction is predicated on the view that the source of the \"Italian philoso­phy of the Christian religion'' is Pythagoras, whose thought, in turn, originated in Kabbalah. 35 In De verbo mirifico, Reuchlin had already spoken of Pythagoricam Cabalam, the \"Pythagorean Kabbalah:'36 Elaborating on this theme in a letter to Pope Leo X in 1517, the same year De arte cabalistica was published, he wrote: I believed that you would hardly be displeased if I should make public the doctrines which Pythagoras and the noble Pythagoreans are said to have"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 317 held ....

Reuchlin's approach, which fits into the general frame­work of Renaissance Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, can be traced more spe­cifically to Pico, who thus began the forty-seventh of his Conclusiones cabalisti­cae, \"Just as man and the inferior priest sacrifices to God the souls of irrational animals, so Michael the superior priest sacrifices the souls of rational animals:'42 Drawing on the depiction of the archangel Michael as the celestial high priest attested in ancient Jewish mysticism, Pico contrasts the sacrifice of animals in the earthly temple to the sacrifice of human beings in the heavenly temple. Need­less to say, the sacrifice of humans is not meant to be taken literally; it is rather a symbolic expression of a spiritual death occasioned by the contemplative retreat from the mundane. Explicating the matter in more detail in the eleventh of the Conclusiones cabalisticae, Pico writes, \"The way in which the rational souls are sacrificed by the archangel to God, which is not explained by the Cabalists, only occurs through the separation of the soul from the body, not of the body from the soul except accidentally, as happens in the death of the kiss, of which it is written: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints (Ps. 116:15).\"43 The reader is told explicitly that the sacrifice of the rational souls refers to the disconnection of the soul from the body, which is also characterized poetically as death by the kiss, 44 another theme well attested in kabbalistic literature in­eluding texts that probably influenced Pico.45 For Reuchlin as well, Kabbalah is essentially about the detachment of the soul from the body, dying to the world through the kiss, which is eternal life. I have already touched on Reuchiin's approach to Kabbalah as a \"contempla­tive art:' but it would be worthwhile to cite some more texts to get a better sense of the nexus between esotericism and soteriology in his thinking: \"God has given to men who walk upon the earth nothing they could more desire than this contemplative art, and that kabbalists more than others possess robust intellects and fe rtile minds; and that nothing admits more of the search for salvation in this world, and everlasting life in the next.\"46 \"Kabbalah is a matter of divine revelation handed down to further the contemplation of the distinct Forms and of God, contemplation bringing salvation: Kabbalah is the receiving of this through symbols.\"47 In a third passage, Kabbalah is said to be based on the no­tion of \"hUm.an salvation'' that is not susceptible to either rational investigation or verification by sense perception.48 Significantly, in that context, Reuchlin uses (without specifying his source explicitly) the exegesis of the verse \"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver\" (Prov. 25:11), found in the intro­duction to The Guide of the Perplexed by Maimonides to edify the nature of the parabolic intent of scripture: the silver relates to the outer or literal meaning and"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 319 the gold to the inner or symbolic. 49 What is most noteworthy is that gold is as­sociated in Reuchlin with Kabbalah proper (Cabala) and silver with \"kabbalistic art\" (arte cabalistica), which comprises the \"complicated rules and human skills\" in which the esoteric teaching is wrapped. This distinction is followed by Reuch­lin's referring to another Maimonidean idea cited in Hebrew as a dictum of the kabbalists: \"The account of creation is the natural science and the account of the chariot is divine science:'50 In Reuchlin's mind, the literal sense, the kabbal­istic art, is correlated with physics since it deals with the material world, and the symbolic sense, the secrets of Kabbalah, with metaphysics or matters that per­tain to the intelligible realm. 51 In the continuation of this discussion, Reuchlin distinguishes Talmudists and kabbalists on grounds that while both acknowledge that there are two worlds, the sensible and the intelligible, Talmudists focus their attention exclusively on the former and kabbalists on the latter.52 Rabbis, we are told, are preoccupied with \"God the creator, the First Cause,\" and not with \"God himself, immanent and absolute;' the object of kabbalistic speculation. \"It is a safe generalization;' concludes Reuchlin, \"that, as befits the contrasting lives of action and contem­plation, using the same passages of Holy Scripture the Talmudists will extract the message of a slave's fear, while the Kabbalist will extract one of a son's love:'53 Reuchlin acknowledges that kabbalists \"keep the Law devoutly;' but he insists that they \"are more inclined towards contemplation;' and thus they are called anshei ha-iyy un mi-ba'alei ha-torah, \"men of speculation from the masters of Torah:' Talmudists are like slaves engaged in matters of this world, which is com­pared to night, and hence the pietistic quality suitable for them is fear; kabbal­ists, by contrast, seek to be removed from the social-political arena in order to achieve the \"stillness and tranquility of spirit\" appropriate to free men in the world to come, which is the true day, and thus for them the motivating factor is love. 54 Reuchlin uses another Maimonidean notion to express this distinction, again citing a Hebrew dictum without mentioning the name of its author: kawwanat kelal ha-torah shenei devarim we-hem tiqqun ha-nefesh we-tiqqun ha-guf, \"the intention of the entire Law aims at two perfections, the perfection of the soul and the perfection of the body:'55 The mystical significance of the first letter of Torah, beit, is to demarcate the two perfections, physical and psychic, that cor­respond to the levels of meaning in the text, exoteric and esoteric, which in turn correspond to the two realms of being in the world, sensible and intelligible. 56 Just as Ezekiel beheld the \"vision of the glory\" (similitudo gloriae) from the \"wheel within the wheel\" (Ezek. 1:17), the one enlightened in esoteric lore discerns the spirit through the veil of the letter. The task of the kabbalist, which confirms the Christian ideal of ascetic piety, is to focus mentally on the inner meaning of scripture so that he may attain a vision of the divine, the ultimate felicity of the"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"320 INVOKING ANGELS souP7 \"But the man who controls the thoughts in his heart to such an extent that he can expel affairs of the flesh and meditate on spiritual matters enshrined in the Law (spiritualia legis meditetur), that man, I say, is blessed, for he will see God with a pure heart:•ss By indulging in this \"higher speculation,\" kabbalists \"transcend creation and the creatures\" and stand thereby \"in the sole emanation of the Deity.\"59 We may conclude, therefore, that in Reuchlin's thinking, the archaic Jewish gnosis is concerned, first and foremost, with soteriology. In Reuchlin's own words, 'After the prophets, this expectation of the coming of the Messiah bring­ing salvation, and all the practice of Kabbalah which is centered directly on the enduring deliverance of the Messiah, circles round it and leads back to it.\"60 The \"happy kabbalist:' Reuchlin writes in another passage, \"following the path of re­ceived truth that is Kabbalah, breaks out of the shadows, leaps into the circle of lamplight, from here moves on to daylight, and from the clear light of day comes understanding to illumine (within the limits of human ability) that truth of being:' The mind of the kabbalist, accordingly, is often \"in a state of unutterable delight, rejoicing in spirit, in the depths of inner silence, driving away from it­self humdrum earthly matters ... carried away to the heavenly and the invisible that lies beyond all human sense. Then, though yet a guest of the body, he be­comes a fellow of the angels, a sojourner in the home above the heavens: his frequent intercourse may be recognized as being in heaven. When he travels to the higher regions, he does so in the company of angels, he often sees the soul of the Messiah:'61 Reuchlin has astutely understood the intricate weave of prophetic visualiza­tion and eschatological salvation that had long characterized the mystical ideal proffered by kabbalists. Indeed, as various scholars have pointed out, in part criticizing Scholem's surmise that messianism and mysticism do not merge until the sixteenth century, when kabbalists responded to the crisis of the expulsion ofJews from the Iberian peninsula, a messianic impulse is evident from the very beginnings of Kabbalah as a historical phenomenon, as it can be traced through literary sources shaped within discernible cultural contours. 62 I concur with this view, and thus there is a solid textual basis to argue that Reuchlin's messianic interpretation of kabbalistic symbolism is not contrived or imposed from with­out. Moreover, the emphasis he places on Kabbalah as an ascetic discipline that leads to a: vision of God is well attested in kabbalistic texts.63 Reuchlin percep­tively cites the remark of Nabmanides, albeit generically as a statement of the kabbalists, that \"prior to apprehending the vision the soul must depart from oneself\" (ki terem she-yasig li-re'iyyah tiparet nafsho mealav),64 to drive home the point that envisioning God is dependent on the separation of the soul from the body, a simulation of death that is brought about through contemplative prac-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 321 tices. As one may deduce from other comments of Nabmanides, he believed it possible for enlightened kabbalists to undergo this experience-which he refers to in one critical passage as the vision on the part of the \"pure souls\" of the glory incarnate in the angelic garment that assumes the shape of an anthropos65-while in the body, an experience that he links to the biblical injunction to cleave to God, a spiritual conjunction that entails the transformation of the carnal flesh into an astral body, a refurbishment of the divine image with which Adam was created.66 This would be consistent with Reuchlin's comment (spoken through Marranus) that Simon taught that Kabbalah \"leads to the height of blessedness and the greatest happiness:· which is identified as \"salvation:· the \"restoration of the human race after the first fali:'67 It is not necessary to belabor the fact that this fo rmulation is indebted to the long-standing Christological interpretation of the Genesis narrative of Adam, Eve, and the Garden of Eden. Yet if we look beyond the immediate, reflex reaction it occasions in those who wish to draw clear boundaries between the two liturgical communities, and thereby ignore the disarray of the particulars that render suspect our taxonomic classifications, then it is not incorrect to say kabbalists have affirmed a view that bears strong similarities to the portrayal of the messianic moment as a rectification and re­turn to the primal state. Kabbalist Critique of Rabbinic Ritualism In spite of being well anchored in Jewish texts, the tone of Reuchlin's pronounce­ments at times bears a distinctively polemical tenor that represents a perspective at odds with the tradition. 68 This dimension of Reuchlin would seem to confirm the observation of Cyril O'Regan that a \"Kabbalistic genealogy\" sustained by the Christian appropriation of Jewish esotericism is essentially an \"anti-Jewish discourse;' a tendency already evident in Renaissance Christian kabbalism but exacerbated in the \"post-Renaissance and post-Reformation field of narrative:'69 Nevertheless, it seems to me the matter is a bit more complex. In the first in­stance, Christian kabbalists do not completely reject the theurgical dimension, and thus I would have to disagree with O'Regan's assessment (based on an un­critical acceptance ofldel's interpretation) that the Christological presentation of the occult wisdom of Kabbalah divorced the theosophical and theurgical, leading supposedly to an overemphasis on the speculative over the practical, an orienta­tion reflected in Scholem's approach to Kabbalah as a religious phenomenon.70 This is not the place to evaluate the accuracy of Idel's portrayal of Scholem, an undertaking that is obviously necessary before one can accept the theoreti­cal basis for O'Regan's historiographical reconstruction. For my purposes, it is"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"322 INVOKING ANGELS sufficient to emphasize that the matter of ritual and theurgic efficacy is not com­pletely obliterated by Christian proponents of an esoteric Jewish gnosis. More­over, Scholem was not wrong in intuiting that kabbalists from the thirteenth century proffered a mystical hermeneutic to interpret Torah in its narratological and ritualistic facets. As I have suggested in my own studies, this hermeneutic displays a paradox in both domains. That is, the narratological meaning is to be discerned in the hearing of the ineffable and the ritualistic in the intent to fulfill the law by its surpassing. In contrast to Scholem, I have called this decidedly Pauline understanding ofkabbalism \"hypernomian\" rather than \"antinomian?'71 As a final piece of evidence, consider Reuchlin's distinction between Talmud­ists who \"attempt to make the liberation of the royal Messiah relate to our physi­cal captivity\" and kabbalists who \"believe that the Messiah will come to free the wretched men of the human race from the chains of the original breach of jus­tice, to let their sins fa ll, to save the souls of those who loyally serve God, souls our father Adam shut out of eternal life until the Messiah makes amends ... for he comes to wipe out the guilt of the human race, and to open up the road to virtue:'72 I would not deny, as a number of scholars have noted, that in Jewish kabbalistic texts we can find a portrait of a messianic figure whose primary role is to convert human nature, effecting the reparation (tiqqun) that restores the pristine condition prior to the sin of Adam and Eve.73 I also readily admit that some kabbalists (Abulafia is perhaps the most striking example) have affirmed a more spiritualized understanding of messianic redemption, with a primary fo cus on attaining a mental state that is effectively a withdrawal from mundane mat­ters rather than the establishment of a different sociopolitical order.74 Neverthe­less, what is troubling in Reuchlin's formulation is the unequivocal distinction between the two facets of the Jewish messianic ideal, spiritual and political, which are preserved in some fashion even by kabbalists inclined more to the fo rmer than to the latter. Notwithstanding the critical marking of Kabbalah as the ground wherein the wellsprings of Christian piety and dogma are to be sought, Reuchlin expresses his enmity toward Judaism as an independent religion that has worn out its usage, persisting in its ritual tenacity even while transmitting the gnosis that leads to its own transcendence and undoing. The crucial remark-which reca­pitulates many of the most hideous stereotypes of the Jew advanced in medieval Christian sources, both textual and visual-is placed in the mouth ofMarranus in a literary setting wherein he reflects on Simon's interrupting a particularly intense discussion on account of the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath: And his words have inspired me to meditate on these difficult matters, to the point where I can conceive of nothing I would rather do.

Believe me, I wanted to hear more so much that I would have stayed up all night to watch that man's face and listen to him talking. If only this wretched Sabbath had not intervened this evening.75 In a second passage, Reuchlin attempts to clarify the Jewish practice of Sab­bath observance in response to the comment of Philolaus that the Pythagoreans count every day a holy Sabbath, when they are able to lay aside mundane mat­ters and engage in \"joyous meditation:' Reuchlin explains the halakhic ritual by referring to the kabbalistic interpretation of Sabbath (based, in part, on a pas­sage from Sha'arei Orah, the treatise on the se.firot composed in the last decade of the thirteenth century by the Spanish kabbalist Joseph Gikatilla) as a sym­bolic reference to the world to come (an older idea attested in rabbinic literature that was embellished in medieval forms of religiosity),76 which he explicates in a decidedly Christological sense: This then is the Sabbath of the Kabbalists, to be kept holy for all time. In it we follow the will not of the flesh but of the spirit, we contemplate the di­vine, giving no attention to what stands against God, for to all the nations he stands for Law, Law that springs from his very nature. As for you, the law of Moses was not brought to you, and Jewish practices do not oblige you to revere this number ... I shall extort no number from you. I ask only calm and peace of mind, in surrender to God and the divine alone. Such a state is achieved above aU in allegorical investigations of the kind we car­ried out in discussion between us as you so much wanted.77 This text demands an analysis that lies beyond the scope of this essay. Suffice it to note that Reuchlin has grasped the symbolic intent of the kabbalistic under­standing of ritual, and the unbridgeable chasm separating Jew and non-Jew that ensues from this orientation. In the end, however, he must make room for the Christological turn, the swerve on the path, as it were, and thus he assures Phi­lolaus that he need not keep the Jewish Sabbath, for ultimately what really mat­ters is the allegorical significance of the ritual that points to attaining peace of mind and surrender to God, states that are attainable without the agency of halakhic practice.

This characterization is not fanciful on Reuchlin's part, as it reflects an attitude well attested in compositions written by Jewish kabbalists since the emergence of Christian Kabbalah from the late fifteenth century.78 What is strik­ing about the passage from De arte cabalistica is that Simon expresses hesitation by stating that his religious obligation prevents him from \"exposing hidden, sacred mysteries to outsiders with no initiation into Jewish rites:'79 Since the secretive matters are often withheld from Jews themselves, being found \"only in a few scattered books, cloaked in obscurity and disguised in riddles;· it is obvi­ously necessary to conceal them from those who have no familiarity with the practical side of Judaism. The \"burning desire\" of Philolaus and Marranus \"to examine the highest matters\" offsets the rabbinic admonitions against disclos­ing secrets, though Simon will still be cautious and demonstrate restraint \"in the most difficult of the precepts;· for in exposing the mysteries the \"barriers have been taken down;' and the \"sun's light is shed on all without distinction:'80 Here Reuchlin articulates the tension between the rabbinic propensity to conceal eso­teric matters from unworthy recipients and the yearning of Christians to gain access to the inner dimension ofJewish tradition. What is especially noteworthy is Reuchlin's recognition that from the perspective of Jewish kabbalists there is no sense in severing law and spirit. In the end, he may vehemently reject law, his view based on the Pauline animosity toward Pharasaic nomianism, but, at the very least, he acknowledges that this would be antithetical to the kabbalists' own way of being. Reuchlin is accurate in noting that the kabbalists infused traditional rituals with cosmic significance by interpreting them symbolically as referring to the pleroma of divine potencies. However, his statement that the symbolic exposi­tion of the law in isolation from fulfilling it \"lifts the mind to higher things\" and \"raises it toward the divine\"81 is an obvious departure from the kabbalists he cites, who have always tried to uphold the literal application together with the symbolical interpretation. The privileging of the contemplative over the corpo­real in a manner that would obliterate the latter smacks of an overspiritualizing st ance that accords with the Christian predilection with regard to the fleshly law of the Jews. The bias is hardly veiled in Reuchlin's observation that \"speculation leads to a Kabbalistic sort of understanding of the Law that imbues our minds with spiritual meditation and shapes them as if into its own likeness. This, we reckon, is the meditation on the Law that was handed down to Moses from the mouth of God after the Law had been given to Moses in the fire and the stone tablets had been broken and repaired:'82 In this passage, Reuchlin has reinter­preted the account of the Sinaitic origin of Kabbalah given by Nabmanides, for whom the revelation consisted of the written and oral To rah, the latter identified more specifically as the oral tradition that engenders decoding the text as com-"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 325 posed of divine names.83 For Reuchlin, the oral tradition given to Moses con­sisted of the spiritual sense that transcends the literal, a point accentuated by the fact that the oral tradition, which is apprehended by the exegete proficient in the art of Kabbalah transmitted in an unbroken chain of authority, is given to Moses only after the law has been revealed from the fire and the stone tablets broken. From a second passage it is clear that, according to Reuchlin's understanding, Nabmanides was articulating an originary sense of formlessness of the primor­dial Torah, a chaotic disarray of the letters.84 The scrambled nature of this text, coupled with the lack of vocalization, allows for multiple readings that are de­termined by the various forms ofkabbalistic exegesis, including letter transpo­sition and numerology.85 Departing from his source, however, Reuchlin under­stands the construction of the scriptural text through the different hermeneutical modes as a response to the breaking of the original Torah, which comprised moral laws and ceremonial rites. Needless to say, this is a crucial reversal of the kabbalistic teaching proffered by Nabmanides, for whom the oral Torah, or the Torah scripted upon the fo rearm of God in black fire on white fire, is the pri­mordial text (an uninterrupted sequence of divine names) that precedes the writ­ten Torah, conventionally divided into narrative and law. One cannot imagine Nabmanides, or fo r that matter any kabbalist articulating the Judaic perspective, describing the Torah in its mystical valence as reparation of the shattered tablets of the covenant. Alphabetical Kabbalah in a Christological Key As I have already noted, Reuchlin depicts Pythagoreanism in much the same light, as a \"symbolic philosophy\" that leads to the salvation of humanity, con­strued as escaping from the corporeal world.86 There is, however, one issue that distinguishes Kabbalah and the ancient Italian philosophy: the theurgic efficacy accorded the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and in particular the divine names that derive from the tetragrammaton. In one passage Reuchlin speaks tellingly of the \"alphabetical Kabbalah\" (alphabeticaria hec Cabala) through which \"are laid open the greatest mysteries of the divine\" (arcana diuinorum maxima).87 To be sure, for Reuchlin, the distinction I have made is not viable, for he earnestly be­lieved that the \"alphabetical numerical mode\"88 of Hebrew promulgated by kab­balists is affirmed as well in ancient Pythagorean thought. Thus he observes that the \"higher speculation'' elucidated by kabbalists, which is focused chiefly on the alphabet, occasions a return to childhood that he identifies as the \"Pythagorean rebirth:'89 One should also recall that in De verbo miri.fico Reuchlin expresses the view that the power of the names, the essence of the ancient Hebraic wisdom,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"326 INVOKING ANGELS was transmitted to the Greek philosophers Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato, and hence we can retrieve \"Mosaic vestiges'' in their thought.90 In spite of his sincere intentions, however, from a critical standpoint we can and must distinguish the perspective that is unique to the kabbalists. Reuchlin himself, in consonance with Pico,91 maintains that the theurgical efficacy of the divine names stems from the assumption that Hebrew is the \"fount of all lan­guages;' compared to which all other languages are impoverished. Even though a comparable link between the linguistic and mathematical is found in the phil­osophical ruminations of the school ofPythagoras, Reuchlin extols the suprem­acy of Hebrew by concluding that there is \"no other language in the world whose letters so perfectly show any number:'92 The dependence ofkabbalistic praxis on Hebrew is so intricate that \"only with great difficulty\" can it \"be translated into the speech of other nations:'93 The assumption regarding the unique status of Hebrew fostered by Kabbalah underlies the desire and demand on the part of Reuchlin and other Christian kabbalists to study the language of the Jews. The indelible link between linguistic mastery and esoteric knowledge is made ex­plicit in a letter Reuchlin wrote in 1508: \"I assure you that not one of the Latins can expound the Old Testament unless he first becomes proficient in the lan­guage in which it was written. For the mediator between God and man was language, as we read in the Pentateuch; but not any language, only Hebrew, through which God wished his secrets to be made known to man�\"94 Reuchlin's literary vita illustrates the extent to which he remained true to his belief that knowledge of Hebrew is foundational for Christian faith. In 1506 he published De rudimentis hebraica, a Hebrew grammar; in 1512, In septem psalm as poeniten­tiales, a translation of the seven penitential psalms and a commentary; and, in 1518, De accentibus et orthographia linguae hebraicae, a treatise on accents, pro­nunciation, and synagogue music. I concur, therefore, with the observation that Reuchlin's \"study of Hebrew was almost as much a religious exercise as a schol­arly preoccupation:'95 The distinctive rank accorded Hebrew supplied Reuchlin with the ultimate argument in his 1510 legal opinion written to advocate against Christians' con­fiscation and destruction ofJewish books.96 Reuchlin uses a similar line of rea­soning in the dedication of De accentibus, addressed to Cardinal Adrian, noting that the importance of learning Hebrew was \"to give youth, bent upon studying languages, a leader under whose banner they would be able to fight, if need be, with those ferocious and rabid dogs who hated all good arts; against the disease and pestilence of everything old; against the burners of books who thirsted for the destruction and extermination of the most ancient monuments. As an old man he might cease to teach elements of grammar, but his zeal fo r the spread of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 327 the study of Hebrew makes him forget all objections:'97 G. Lloyd Jones has ar­ticulated the widely accepted view that Reuchlin's interest in the Jewish mystical tradition \"was a driving force behind his determination to master Hebrew and safeguard the existence of Hebraic literature:'98 Reuchlin's defense of safeguard­ing Jewish books cannot be isolated from his acceptance of the widespread kab­balistic presumption that Hebrew is the matrix through which all things are created. The inherent theurgical potency of the letters-a cornerstone of Jewish esotericism-and the kabbalistic understanding of language as the locus of se­crecy captivated Reuchlin's imagination. Particularly important is the third book of De arte cabalistica, which includes lengthy discussions (buttressed by transla­tions of primary texts) of the different names of God and angels. Special signifi­cance is accorded the tetragrammaton, the name that signifies the ineffable, invisible, and unknowable essence of God, the source of all creation, the alef that is the beginning that emerges from the \"infinite sea of Nothingness:' Just as there is no end to the divine substance, there can be no terminus to the myster­ies of the tetragrammaton. This, according to Reuchlin, is the true intent of the traditional idiom shem ha-mefo rash, that is, the name \"that explains the essence of God:'99 Knowledge of the name empowers one with wisdom that is theosophi­cal and theurgical. The inability to separate these two dimensions is made especially clear in Reuchlin's comments on the seventy-two-letter name, which, according to the tradition, is derived exegetically from Exodus 14:19-21 (216 consonants divided into seventy-two triplets). In Reuchlin's presentation, the seventy-two names are \"one symbolic name;' which points to the \"good, great God\" through \"many varied angelic methods:' Kabbalists \"greatly worship and venerate these names\" because through them they \"work unutterably wonderful miracles:'100 To sub­stantiate the point textually, Reuchlin quotes from the fourteenth-century Ital­ian kabbalist Menabem Recanati, who wrote in his commentary to the afore­mentioned biblical verses, \"The letters flutter above in the essence of the chariot and they are appointed to carry out every matter, and their efficacy is known to kabbalists.\"101 Recanati's words are a commentary on a passage in an earlier midrashic work, the Letters of Rabbi Akiva, cited by Reuchlin himself, that por­trays the emergence of the seventy-two-letter name from before the throne of glory in crowns of fire. The theological danger is to believe that the angelic fo rces are the causal agents in the universe, a belief that would amount to superstition at best and idolatry at worst; what is acceptable, indeed the mystical truth, is that the angels are the names by which God exercises his providential care. The singular contribution of Kabbalah is to recognize the onomastic nature of the"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"328 INVOKING ANGELS angels. In virtue of the knowledge of the angelic hosts, masters of Kabbalah ac­cess the tetragrammaton, \"the name through which a man can effect miracles, by acting as a fe llow-worker and as a delegate fr om God:'102 Precisely on account of the potency of the names bestowed upon one who acquires knowledge of them, Reuchlin envisions the theurgical activity in con­templative terms. This is illustrated, for instance, in his comment that by means of the relevant verses in Psalms that yield the seventy-two names, the kabbalists \"lift their minds as high as they can go towards God and, surrounded by such great praise, courageously ascend from angel to angel, always reaching from one to the next into the sublime. The angels help them in their task so that they leave secular care behind and are carried as far as they are able to God, like light fe ath­ers wafted up by the lightest of breaths to the sublime regions ofheaven.\"103 The mental ascent culminates in an apprehension of the one name, the tetragram­maton, which comprises the other names. Reuchlin affirms another standard kabbalistic principle, indebted particularly to the formulation of Gikatilla: To rah in its mystical essence relates to the sefirot, which correspond to the names that all emanate from the fo ur-letter name. Insofar as the Torah equals the name, and the name comprises all the other letters of the Hebrew alphabet, it fo llows that each of the letters is transposed mystically into a divine name.104 It is this thea­sophie assumption that underlies Reuchlin's assertion that \"the holy letters ... bring us to admiration of divine matters and then bind us fa st to them in love:'105 For all the aversion Reuchlin shows in relation to Jewish ritual, his unwavering commitment to Kabbalah leads him to enunciate a quintessentially Jewish pro­clivity whereby Torah study becomes the preeminent means by which one is conjoined to God. Thus, as Simon reminds his partners in trialogue, indubitably reflecting the viewpoint adopted by Reuchlin, the combinations of the twenty­two letters of the Hebrew alphabet delineated in Sefe r Ye tsirah \"should not be understood in any boorish or uneducated way, fo r every one of them is the Spirit .... We must contemplate them spiritually with great joy for they have not been handed down to us for denigration or mockery but for us to embrace the mysteries of Scripture with pious faith. By trusting in the letters we shall find it easier to speculate on higher things:'106 Just as the word of God was disclosed to Moses through a cloud, so one can discern the secrets hidden in the letters. In­deed, the spirit cannot be seen except through the body of the text, for the mys­tery of the name is cloaked in the garment of the letter. The magical impact of the science ofletter permutation and the manipulation of cosmic forces based thereon are inevitable consequences of the kabbalistic assumption regarding the ontological standing of Hebrew as the \"basis of the world and of the Law.\"107 Reuchlin thus approvingly records accounts about cre­ating a golem108 and the writing of amulets by means of divine names.109 Never-"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"I.ANGUAGE, SECRECY, AND THE MYSTERIES OF LAW 329 theless, the ultimate significance of this wisdom lies in the spiritual value it has for the adept, making possible the exegetical comprehension of the secrets of the revealed word of God. \"We shall proceed through the combinations of the twenty-two alphabets until with careful, prudent and unflagging diligence we reach the highest and first alphabet. We need to run through each combination carefully until the voice of God becomes clear and the text of Sacred Scripture is opened up and offered to us:'110 To the extent that the true being of reality c�nsists of the combinations of letters, which are expressive of the one name that is the essence of God, the \"highest and first alphabet;' it fo llows that fo cusing on the linguistic underpinning of all that exists assists in the redemption from the phys­ical world. \"Consideration of all created things leads back, within the bounds of human capability, to understanding of the one Creator. That understanding is our salvation and eternal life. Thus we pass from God, through his Name, back to God. He himself is his own Name of the four letters, which is blessed always to eternity.\"lll Reuchlin apprehended that the Christian doctrine of incarnation finds its ideational basis in the confluence of anthropomorphic and linguistic symbolism that has informed the mythopoeic comportment ofkabbalists through the gen­erations.112 Notably, toward the end of the trialogue, the figure of Marranus draws an analogy between the efficacy of the name of Jesus in Christian faith and the theurgical potency of the tetragrammaton in kabbalistic speculation. I have al­ready referred to this critical passage, but let me reiterate here that for Reuchlin the main point is not only that the name of Jesus assumes a parallel function to YHWH, but also that Christians have a decided advantage over Jews inasmuch as they possess the true name of the Messiah, the pentagram, which renders the ineffable name pronounceable. In what may be call ed a rhetorically brilliant stroke, Reuchlin has his Jewish character, Simon, respond to Marranus, \"Per­haps you are right, but why should you have to use words?\" Why, the reader is impelled to ask, should there be a question about using words when the theme being discussed is the effectiveness of words? The comment, it seems, is meant to suggest that the most recondite secret, the secret of the secret, the secret that there is a secret, must remain unspoken. From the perspective of the Jew, this is the situation of the secrets cultivated by Christian kabbalists. Thus, Simon con­tinues in his response: At any rate, the better Kabbalist sages tried to liken this figure of the Cross to the tree of the bronze serpent set up in the desert, though they did so silently and secretly. This they did through Gematria, that is, numerical equality, for tselem, meaning \"Cross,\" and ets, meaning \"Tree;' both have letters symbolizing one-hundred-and-fifty. So passing from one to another,"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"33 0 INVOKING ANGELS from cross to tree and tree to cross, is easy. But I put a finger to my lips, Time is brief, my good fr iends, and I am restricted from saying all I might wish.113 One cannot miss the irony here: the detailed discourse on the art of Kabbalah through the prism of the power of Hebrew, a discussion that occupies most of the third book of the trialogue, ostensibly organized around Gikatilla's threefold division of exegetical techniques-numerology (gematria), acrostics (notariqon), and transpositions (temurah)-terminates with an appeal to silence. This si­lence, however, is not related to the apophatic tendency prevalent in the history of Christian mysticism (due in great measure to the influence of Neoplatonism, transmitted especially through the works of Dionysius the Areopagite)114 to deny the ability of language to depict ultimate reality or truth, but rather to the political need to conceal esoteric matters on account of their potentially dangerous implications. Eventually Simon provides a numerical proof fo r the Christolo�cal claim, a proof that is dependent on language inasmuch as the nu­merology is inherently linked to the letters. Perhaps even more apposite is the explication that Reuchlin cites from Sefer Iggeret ha-Sodot, the Ep istula secreto­rum by the converted Jew, Paulus de Heredia, us of the twelve-letter name of God as av ben we-rua/:1 ha-qodesh, that is, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and the fo rty­two-letter name as av elohim ben elohim rua/:lha-qodesh elohim sheloshah be-e/:lad e}Jad bi-sheloshah, that is, \"God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, three in one and one in three:'116 The secret names of God are thus interpreted as encoding the mystery of the Trinity. We may conclude, therefore, that the reticence that Reuchlin attributes to Simon to speak of the affinity between Kabbalah and Christianity does not un­dermine the nexus between language and secrecy so central to Jewish mysti­cism. On the contrary, as I have intimated, the emphasis on the inherent value of language in Jewish esotericism culminates in the tradition about the penta­gram in Christian Kabbalah, the name by which the nameless is called. When faced with this ultimate secret, the Jew has no choice but to remain silent. From the Christian's standpoint, the Jew's refusal to speak attests more vociferously to the secrecy of what could have been spoken in speaking the unspoken. NOTES 1.

For a different approach to Pico, based on the surmise that he used Kabbalah, first and fo remost, to support his own philosophy and thus should not be read as a Chris­tian kabbalist, see Alexander Thumfart, \"Readings on Cabbala: Giovanni Pica della Mirandola,\" in jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century: Proceedings of the Sixth EAJS Congress, To ledo, July 1998, eel Judit Targarona Borras and Angel S:ienz-Badillos, l vols. (l..e iden: Brill, 1999), 2:83-90. 10. The point is epitomized in the fifteenth of the twenty-six Conclusiones magicae, 9>15, in Pica's 900 Theses: \"No magical operation can be of any efficacy unless it has annexed to it a work of Cabala, explicit or implicit\" (Syncretism in the West, 499). For Pico, though Kabbalah and magic are linked together, the former occupies a higher grade in the spiritual hierarchy. See, for instance, Conclusiones magicae, 9> 18: \"The nature of that which is the horizon of temporal eternity is next to the magus, but above him, and proper to it is the Cabala\" (ibid., 501). To grasp this aphorism, we must bear in mind the two preceding conclusions: according to the former, the horizon of the \"eternal time\" (temporis aeternalis) is beneath magic, whereas, according to the latter, magic is proper to the horizon of time and eternity (temporis et aeternitatis). The spiritual efficacy of Kabbalah is linked to the highest rung, the horizon of \"temporal eternity\" (aeternitatis temporalis). See Conc/usiones magicae, 9>26: \"Just as through the influence of the first agent, if that influence is individual and immediate, something is achieved that is not attained through the mediation of causes, so through a work of Cabala, if it is the pure and immediate Cabala, something is achieved to which no magic attains\" (503). Also significant is another aphorism from this section, 9>7: \"The works of Christ could not have been performed through either the way of magic or the way of Cabala\" (497).

For a somewhat different approach to this question reflected in the distinction between the \"real Ca­bala'' based on God's language embedded in the Book of Nature and the \"vulgar Cabala\" expressed in Hebrew and the Jewish tradition, see Deborah E.

Wirszubski rejects the notion that Pico himself had knowledge of the penta­gram (218). A close reading of the relevant texts in Pico seems to bear out this conclusion.

In making a distinction between the hidden and the revealed name, Pico calls to mind an important theme not only in kabbalistic gnosis, especially prominent in zoharic passages (for select references, see Wolfson, Abraham Abula.fia, 30nn66-67), but also a motif in ancient Christian gnosis, as is attested, for instance, by the hymn in Phil. 2:9-10, Gospel of Philip 54:5-13 and 56:3-15, critical edition and translation in Nag Hammadi Codex II. 2-il ed.

Attridge (Leiden: Brill, 1985),110-11. For another possible allusion to the secret name, see Rev. 19:12-13. It is likely, as scholars have noted, that the tradition regarding the investiture of the name represents an older Jewish esoteric motif that was appropriated by early follow­ers of Jesus and used to demarcate onomanologically his transfiguration into Christ.

My use of this terminus technicus, traceable to Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, accords with the suggestion of Charles Zika, \"Reuchlin and Erasmus: Humanism and Occult Philosophy,\" Journal of Religious History 9 (1977): 2.16, that the expression refers to a \"science concerned with the operations of wonders through the agency of non-rational powers-whether through powers operating in the elemental world as occult virtue, in the celestial world as astral fo rces, or in the supercelestial divine world as divine and angelic beings. Occult philosophy is not only a science of non-rational powers, therefore, but also a science of their 'operation: In other words, it relates either explicitly or implicitly to magia or magic, although this magic may be elemental, astral, demonic, or angelic.\" See Zika, \"Re­uchlin's De verba miri.fico,\" 107.

The surmise that the blending of mysticism and magic in Christian sources from the late Middle Ages and especially in the Renaissance is due to the influence of Kabbalah is proffered by Richard Kieckhefer, \"The Devil's Contemplatives: The Liber iuratus, the Liber visionum, and Christian Appropriation of Jewish Occultism;' in Conjuring Spirits: Te xts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic, ed.

In De verbo mirifico, Baruchias and Sidonius both express skepticism about Capnion's ability to perform miracles by uttering divine names. Those who claim such powers are deemed charlatans motivated by avarice. Hence, there is a need to distinguish miracles performed on the basis of ancient tradition and contemporary magical practice.

It was probably something of a turning point in his life. In the next few years he would put before Elizabeth I his proposal for a new academy and begin in earnest his preparations for seeking the Northwest Passage. A seventeen­year-old protege of the Gilberts, John Davis (1550-1605), joined him. Under the guidance of the Gilbert household (including Humphrey's younger stepbrother, Walter Raleigh), Davis was about to embark on a path that would lead him to become one of the great navigators of his age and namesake for the Davis Strait in the Canadian North. Probably also present was Adrian Gilbert, Humphrey's younger brother and Davis's lifelong associate. They came together one day in February and, employing a show stone and crystals, conjured demons and sought the assistance of angels and the dead. Humphrey, the \"master:' read the prayers requesting aid from the divine, conjured the demons, and directed the opera­tions. A variety of visions appeared in the stones, which Davis, as skryer, reported and which they recorded in detail. Some of what the spirits told him suggest that he was seeking information about his own future, but his principal goal was to seek information about performing magic from the world's greatest magicians. To this end, he conjured and bound Azazel, the demon in charge of spirits of the dead, and forced him to bring them Adam, Job, Solomon, Roger Bacon, and Cor­nelius Agrippa. The great magi appeared and consented to help, their numbers supplemented by the unsolicited appearances of Saint Luke and John the Baptist. Humphrey Gilbert and John Davis were certainly colorful characters: en­terprising, audacious, single-minded, self-promoting men whose violent and Research for this article was supported by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. I am also particularly indebted to Claire Fanger, Larry Stewart, and Rory Rapple for their kind advice and assistance."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"342 INVOKING ANGELS dramatic deaths-Davis at the hands of pirates off the coast of Borneo and Gil­bert off the Azores in the wreck of a ship he had been advised to leave-were apt conclusions to lives of inveterate risk taking. But one would have no reason to suspect that they had such involved interests in ritual magic were it not for a record of their activities in the British Library manuscript I discuss here, along with a few circumstantial dues, such as their association with John Dee and his skryers. If fo olhardy and opportunistic, they were of sound mind and built sig­nificant careers in the complex world of Elizabethan politics and business. Natu­rally, such a situation needs no defense or explanation; a belief in the efficacy of ritual magic could hardly be considered unusual in the mid-sixteenth century or its practice sociopathic. On another level, however, their interest in ritual magic appears more puzzling. If Gilbert and Davis do not deserve a place in traditional histories of science, which tend to emphasize great discoveries, they certainly merit inclusion in more recent studies of the social and intellectual context in which modern science was born.1 They made their careers by promoting the investigation of the natural world as a useful and important element in state building. Through his abilities, technical innovations, and publication in the area of navigation, John Davis would come to be what Eric Ash has called an expert mediator, synthesizing practical and experientially derived knowledge with theoretical approaches.2 Gilbert's proposal for a new academy in London reveals an almost Baconian approach to learning, inquiry, and experimentation. In addition to being practical, skeptical, anti-Scholastic, experimental in orientation, and hostile to esoteric language, he also advocated breaking down traditional boundaries among professions and between theory and practice, seeking a fruitful engagement between the theo­retically inclined and those of a more practical bent. Following most accounts of the period, one would expect men of such \"protoscientific\" interests to be attracted to the sort of magical literature concerned with natural causation, the structure of the natural world, and the mathematization of reality. Yet the stan­dard fare of natural magic, astrological image magic, \"astral magic; secrets, mag­ical recipes and experiments, and discourses on natural magic seem to have been of little personal interest to Gilbert and Davis.3 Instead they chose medieval ritual magic, particularly necromancy, a tradition regarded by most historians as a disappearing, superstitious, and utterly unscientific remnant of the Middle Ages.4 This leads to two possible conclusions. Either their interest in this sort of magic was unusual, atavistic, or simply discontinuous with their scientific dispositions-a perfectly reasonable possibility-or ritual magic was not as out­moded and irrelevant to the history of science as we have thought. It will come as no surprise to readers of this volume that I wish to explore the latter possibility. Gilbert's proposal fo r a new academy epitomizes many of the ideas regarded as seminal to the scientific revolution. A closer comparison of his"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 343 proposal with his magical operations and the traditions from which they drew reveals numerous ways in which medieval ritual magic and the intellectual cul­ture that surrounded it conform to the intellectual predispositions and episte­mological assumptions of the early scientific revolution. In fact, such strong commonalities may be fo und between them that this sort of magic should be regarded as a quite natural choice for the sixteenth-century man of science. In turn, this should lead us to reevaluate our assumptions not only about sixteenth­century magic and science but also about magic and science in general. Humphrey Gilbert's Operations and Medieval Ritual Magic The operations I have described are recorded in two related manuscripts bound together in a volume with a variety of other magical works, namely, London, British Library, Additional 36674.5 The first contains a work of necromantic magic and the second a record of the visions attained through its operations, or operations very similar to them. The latter identifies the skryer as John Davis and the master as \"H.G:' Paleographic and circumstantial evidence makes clear that the text was a joint effort of Adrian and Humphrey Gilbert, that the first text was probably written by Adrian, and that the second was probably a draft pre­pared by a secretary based on notes taken during the operations. 6 They began recording visions on February 24 and continued into April. The magical in­structions, begun on March 22, were evidently written contemporaneously with the operations. A great similarity to medieval traditions (discussed in more de­tail below) suggests that they probably had one or more necromantic manu­scripts at their disposal, which they employed as the basis for their operations. They also incorporated prayers and techniques derived from the visions? How heavily the original text or texts may have been edited is unclear, but it seems quite possible that the absence of obviously Catholic elements was due to their editorial efforts. The sources, techniques, goals, and language of these operations are in almost every respect medieval, and most of the differences resulted from relatively su­perficial revisions by their Protestant and secular scribes. After carefully noting that the work was begun at S:oo A.M., the sun in Aries, the text lists a short set of rules fo r operation, including wearing clean clothes, keeping promises, being good to the poor \"where he seeth need;' and avoidance of swearing and drunken company.8 Such rules are commonly fo und in the early fo lios of ritual magic works. The Practica nigromanciae attributed to Roger Bacon specifies clean doth­ing among the rules, and the Liber iuratus gives a strong emphasis to keeping good company.9 Almsgiving is an instruction found in the Ars notoria's Opus ope­rum and in John of Morigny's work. Medieval ritual texts uniformly emphasize"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"344 INVOKING ANGELS good behavior and moral purity, something assured by seeking confession prior to operation.10 They give greater emphasis to sexual purity as inherently pow­erful, something attributable to Catholic traditions in general, but particularly to the emphasis on chastity or sexual self-control in the clerical and university settings where this magic was commonly practiced.11 It seems likely that a Prot­estant scribe (possibly the Gilberts themselves) removed these more stringent requirements and that the relaxed rules reflect conceptions of sexuality and marriage in Protestant thought and/ or the decidedly secular milieu in which many sixteenth-century magicians (and certainly Gilbert and Davis) moved. As I discuss in detail below, the acquisition of information, learning, or wisdom was a fundamental goal of medieval ritual magic, even necromancy.12 The ritual procedures described in the instructions and recorded as having been performed in the vision accounts are similarly drawn directly fr om medi­eval ritual magic. As was the usual practice in necromantic works, the operators employ a combination of angelic and demonic magic, and assume that, while they can command demons, they may only request the aid of God, the angels, and the dead_B They work, for the most part, during the day and are attentive to the hours and the general astrological conditions.14 They employ crystals or other reflecting surfaces for skrying and endeavor both to trap demons in crys­tals and to provide crystals for good spirits to enter voluntarily.15 They require that a skryer be used to see the visions, but not that he be a virgin child, as was common in medieval texts.16 The demon Azazel, whom they conjure, has a long history, beginning with a brief mention in Leviticus, extending through Jewish traditions, and reappearing in Christian Kabbalah in the late fifteenth century. The somewhat more surprising notion that this demon could facilitate access to spirits of the dead might conceivably be Jewish in origin but was certainly immediately derived from Latin necromantic traditions. Similar operations in­volving Azazel survive in several other fifteenth-and sixteenth-century British manuscriptsP Following the instructions for conjuring the dead, the text gives instructions for conjuring the \"Four Kings;' the demons governing the four climes of the world, \"Oriens, Amaimon, Paymon, and LEgin:' Operations for the four kings are very common in medieval necromantic works and commonly employ mirrors or crystals.18 The instruction section of the manuscript concludes with all-purpose conjurations for any spirit. Similar open- ended operations may also be found in necromantic manuals. Aside from the lack of any obviously Catholic formulae, such as Ave Marias, and a reduced emphasis on ascetic practices and moral purity in the period leading up to the operations, the instructions are in­distinguishable fr om those in medieval works.19 The extensive accounts of the visions set this text apart fr om most magical manuscripts. The following passage gives a good impression of them."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 34 5 Seene by H.G. and Jo.: on pe 14 daye of marche anno domini 1567 at the sonns sett, or a little after, I knowe not perfectlye, it was aboute 7 of the cloke.

It seems more likely that the skryer saw and reported visions in which he and the others were participants, though it is possible that the others may occasion­ally have seen things too. Dee's records of his \"actions\" contain similar ambi­guities in the visionary record, where Dee is always an active and imaginative participant in the proceedings, though his notes make it clear that he seldom saw anything. If they are subject to occasional lapses (such as the failure to record the hour, in this instance), and if their record keeping is not as thorough as Dee's, never­theless the Gilberts certainly make an effort to be systematic. They commonly record the time and general astrological conditions. The tremendous attention to detail makes clear that they were concerned to preserve accurate and detailed accounts of what the skryer had reported. That they returned to the text and corrected various details reinforces the impression that they wished the vision accounts to be as accurate as possible.21 Given this concern with detail and ac­curacy, it may well be that the Gilberts' description of the visions as if visible to all was a literary device meant to lend the process credibility and to emphasize that at least two of the men present participated in crafting the reports. This passage illustrates an important way in which Gilbert's operations were not typical of medieval manuals, one that cannot be attributed to changes in reli­gious sensibilities. If medieval magical operators made extensive, detailed notes during their operations, none, to my knowledge, survives. Accounts of visions attained through magical processes may be found in literary works (usually an­timagical) or in instructions for ritual magic operations that tell the operator what should result. More extensive accounts of visions by magical practitioners are less common. The notable exception, John of Morigny's Liber visionum, is a highly polished account clearly reconstructed fr om memories of the visions rather than detailed notes taken at the time. Unlike John's work, but more like the records of John Dee's actions, the visionary records in Additional 36674 ap­pear to be relatively undigested. One might speculate that medieval examples have simply been destroyed or lost, but one would still have to account for why these texts did not survive. The most plausible explanation is that prior to the second half of the sixteenth century, such notes were not considered worth keep­ing. In either case, the extensive note taking of the Gilberts and John Dee, their desire.to preserve the notes, and their efforts to assure their accuracy and sense of immediacy seem to represent a new attitude toward the raw data of the visions. A more detailed examination of the goals and methods involved reveals a simi­lar mix of tradition and innovation. Gilbert's principal goal of deriving knowl­edge manifests itself immediately at the start of the instructions, where the reader is advised to begin with a short general prayer for wisdom."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 3 47 This prayer is to be sayde when and before you deale with any spiritt; This was reuealed by kinge Solomon, Anno domini 1567, die 20 Februarij circa 9. 10. 0 god of Aungelles, god of Archaungells; god of Patriarches, god of Prophetts, god of vs sinners; 0 lord be my help, that this my worke may proceed in good tyme, to thy glorie, 0 god; and to learninge, and noe Art else, glorifie the in all workes.

Amen, lord, Amen with your Pater noster. 22 Such prayers are fundamental elements in ritual magic works like the Ars noto­ria, where they employ similar kinds of formulae and rhetorical strategies. 23 The injunction that this prayer should be said at the start of all spirit operations frames the entire set of instructions as a search for knowledge, and, at least in these pages, this appears to be sincere: the search for secrets, wisdom, or learn­ing predominates throughout the operations. Precisely how the Gilberts and others thought this knowledge was to be transferred, however, is less clear. The request for knowledge in this passage and the attribution of the prayer to Solomon moved Gabriel Harvey, the seven­teenth-century owner and annotator of the manuscript, to note its evident like­ness to the Ars notoria. 24 A passage in which Solomon tells Gilbert that he will be taught \"all the arts\" suggests this work above all others. That Solomon also advises him that he must read when told to do so may be a reference to the ex­ercise of reading required in the performance of the Ars notoria. 25 The request for a \"hiddenn worke\" in the passage quoted above, however, seems to reflect the story of the Liber Razielis, in which secret knowledge is passed to Adam from the angel Raziel, either figuratively or physically in the form of a book.26 That Gilbert is pr omised such a book and that Davis retrieves it from the \"House of Solomon\" in a vision seems to reflect this tradition. 27 Jo. sawe a greate woods, having a greate howse in the middle of yt: with a little house by it most strongly buylded; hauving an Iron dore, with 9 key­holes. these being written vn the dore thes caracts following [numerous sigils ].

At the same time, certain kinds of information were actually transmitted to them, and consistent features may be discerned in both the n�ture of that knowl­edge and how they used it. The great care taken to record the visions suggests that all the small visual details, such as the sigils on the door, might potentially be important sources of information, and perhaps that many of the more incom­prehensible ones, such as the activities of the strange multicolored animals, might need to be decoded or understood at a later date. More important, the spirits in­structed them directly in the proper performance of magic, sometimes even when they had not been asked, and although they certainly referred to conjuring man­uals and perhaps also to the works of Cornelius Agrippa fo r information, they appear to have regarded these sources as secondary to the visions. On March 22, between two and three in the afternoon, Humphrey (probably with great relish) was cursing and condemning Bleath, a particularly recalcitrant minor demon. There came of hymselfe the Euangelist Luke into a christall stone that lay on the bourd. And willed me to leaue using the names of God, to such wicked and rebellious spirits offering hymself to doe all things for me, and to teach me, howe to haue althings done by the angles, without such curs­ings, and coniuring by the word and names of god ....

This intervention by Saint Luke in this passage is a more direct and effortless transition from demonic binding to something more like angelic invocation, its very fluidity suggestive, perhaps, of a �issolving conceptual boundary between angelic and demonic practices. More important, the advice Luke offers runs counter not only to the approach they had already recorded in their book of instructions but also to traditional necromancy as a whole. Rather than the standard method of conjuring, which mimicked exor­cism by invoking holy names and drawing upon the power God promised to good Christians, Luke suggests a temporary but novel arrangement in which he, a spirit of the dead, an elect soul, will control demons on the operator's behalf. As in the case of John of Morigny, visionary experience supersedes traditional and textual authority. It should not be surprising that the Gilberts were willing to take the word of a saint on how to perform magic over what they found in their conjuring manuals, though other examples reveal that this was not an iso­lated instance but part of a purposeful, if not systematic, approach. They did not regard magic as the performance of various experiments, unrelated except for the similarity of their form, but rather as a progressive program of learning, a cumulative process in which information and experience were amassed over time. Such a progression is implicit in the demand that one begin with lower spirits and work up to more difficult ones. \"Bleath, should a younge beginner first call; although to call Assasel yt is the most noble Arte; whose charact fol­lowethe:'32 But the best evidence of their approach to acquiring knowledge lies in the way they assembled the manuscripts we are considering. The Gilberts' careful dating of their visions allows us to reconstruct the com­plex relationship between their operations and the magical manual they were writing, or at least some of it. We know that their operations were probably based on some late medieval conjuring manual that they, or some prior scribe, had adjusted according to Protestant and secular sensibilities. It is also possible, if not likely, that they had tried this kind of thing before. While it is true that Humphrey was blustery enough to fancy himself an expert relatively quickly, the confident tone of the text suggests he had been at it longer than a few weeks. He and Davis began their recorded operations in late February, and on February 20 Solomon dictated a new prayer for them to employ at the start of their oper­ations. Presumably they used this prayer from that point on, since, as we have seen, they accorded it such an important place in their magical manual when they began to write it on March 22 at 8:oo A.M. How much they managed to write before that afternoon is unclear, but by 2:oo P. M. Humphrey was engaged"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"350 INVOKING ANGELS in his operation to conjure the four kings. Shortly after this, Saint Luke appeared, offering the correction and assistance just discussed and promising to teach a new method of operation. Luke fulfilled this promise eight days later, with in­structions for a show stone in which Bleath would not have been able to disobey. The beste and moste excellente waye and Arte is, as well for Aungells, as for Inferiours and other Spyritts, to haue these names of god wryttenn in your stone, as followethe.

Nota: Noe spyritt cann disobay that is called into the stone thus graued; and the makinge therof wast discovered by Luke onn Easter time, beinge in Anno Domini 1567.33 This passage falls on the last folio of the manual, and operations employing . the names of God to control recalcitrant demons appear on the previous folio. Precisely how the new equipment Luke provided was meant to alter the opera­tions is unclear. He certainly did not mean that they should cease employing demons or ghosts, which would have entailed rejecting all the methods they had recorded to that point; rather, Luke \"willed [them] to leaue using the names of God, to such wicked and rebellious spirits:' So it seems likely that they assumed that this addition would make certain operations of the manual unnecessary, but that in other respects it remained appropriate. Gilbert and his associates sought to acquire knowledge in a purposeful, even systematic manner, understanding that it would be a cumulative process. They began with ritual magic manuals in hand, and given that such texts were com­mon, it is quite possible that they had one of the many circulating manuscripts of ritual magic attributed to Solomon or Roger Bacon, or a printed volume by Cornelius Agrippa. If they did not enter into the operations under the assump­tion that their books might need correction, they certainly assumed that true magical knowledge had to be derived from practice and from direct engagement with the numinous rather than from books. In part, they assumed that one had to build up experience in order to practice the art effectively; in part, the prac­tice of the art itself made new information available. They carefully recorded their visions, noting intricate details, evidently assuming that their descriptions might ultimately yield further knowledge. The spirits also instructed them. No doubt they understood that Solomon's promise to assist Gilbert in \"making\" books would be fulfilled in such a fashion-and they certainly did make a new"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 35 1 book. More crucially, the new revealed elements superseded the old and became key elements in the new manual, and at the very least their experiences facilitated a critical dialogue with whatever base text they originally employed. So, despite being based on the texts and traditions of medieval ritual magic, this manuscript differed from them. Protestant attitudes (or the desire not to appear Catholic) probably motivated the Gilberts or some prior scribe to strip out Catholic elements and to remove the requirement of virginity for a skryer and of ascetic practices for the master. The Gilberts added new techniques, prayers, and magical characters to whatever original text or texts they had, and for all we know they may have made a wide range of other undocumented changes based on instructions from the spirits. That they made careful records of the visions seems to constitute a significant change to the medieval traditions of ritual magic, but they do not appear to have affected its processes or intellec­tual culture in a dramatic way. In fact, these changes themselves reflect another significant area of continuity with medieval ritual magic. This continuity can best be understood in the broader context of medieval learned magic. Let me intro­duce this discussion, then, with a brief description of the other major tradition of illicit learned magic prior to 1500. Astrological image magic is represented by hundreds of manuscript witnesses prior to 1500, and the form of those manuscripts is consistent and distinctive. Magical talismans, rings, and other objects bearing some sort of engraved astro­logical symbol had received enough approval from Scholastic writers as a poten­tially nondemonic form of magic to grant this type of magic a kind of associate status within Scholastic natural philosophy. Important works of natural phi­losophy, such as the Speculum astronomiae, regarded some forms of astrological image magic as natural and nondemonic; and philosophers of the stature of Albert the Great had no quarrel with this idea. In part as a result of this, these texts demonstrate a measure of stability in transmission and interpretation. While Thomas Aquinas and others following him were more stringent in their assess­ment of the legitimacy of image magic, these early positive evaluations were enough to keep a debate continuously alive in Scholastic circles from the twelfth through the sixteenth centuries.34 As this debate hinged upon obscure details in the Scholastic model of physical causation, proponents of astrological image magic, eager to find ways to demonstrate its legitimacy, tended to employ Scho­lastic arguments. Opponents and those who had not made up their minds also depended upon the literature of natural philosophy for clarity and guidance. This situation is reflected in the manuscripts and codices and the libraries that con­tained them. Almost uniformly prior to 1500, scribes, collectors, and catalogu­ers treat astrological image magic as part of the library of natural philosophy and naturalia. The principles of Scholastic natural philosophy and the opinions"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"352 INVOKING ANGELS of Scholastic authorities also played a major role in helping scribes to choose appropriate texts to copy. Texts that were conformable to Scholastic prescrip­tions oflegitimacy were copied at a much higher rate than those deemed illegiti­mate, many of which do not survive at ali.35 Works of astrological image magic, by their very nature, also demand a par­ticular kind of treatment by their interpreters and scribes, and this makes them similar to Scholastic scientific works in another sense. According to the argu­ments of the Arabic commentator al-Kindi, the figure in an astrological talisman or ring (as opposed to the stuff of which it was made) had to have an ontological connection with the astrological influences upon which it drew. This assump­tion was implicit in many of the magical texts themselves; it also formed the core question in the Scholastic debate: does the shape of a physical object have or transmit occult properties? Thus, for Latin readers who believed this was pos­sible, the image depicted or described in the text might reflect a cosmological secret: if the image was accurate, the magic would work, and the text would contain a valuable demonstration of powerful linkages between the heavens and the earth. If it was not accurate, if it did not correctly depict the ontological stellar configuration, it was useless. Truth thus potentially resided in the actual depicted figures or characters in the text itself, and their usefulness depended upon their accuracy. More significantly, if an appropriate figure was not em­ployed, the operator ran the risk of invoking the aid of demons. Perhaps for this reason, or perhaps because they were treated like other works of natural phi­losophy, their transmission tended to be relatively stable and the contents did not vary a great deal. The intellectual culture surrounding this sort of magic is thus arguably similar to Scholastic culture in its emphasis on the authority of transmitted texts. The culture surrounding ritual magic and its written traditions could not be more different. Subject to perennial rewriting, editing, and reformulation, ritual magic was perhaps the most mercurial of all medieval magical traditions. The multiplicity of its textual traditions was both the cause and also the result of the fact that in significant ways it stood outside the mainstream. Although Scholas­tic arguments certainly played a role in the rejection of ritual magic practices, no Scholastic authority ever provided a shred of hope that they might be legitimate. They fall entirely in the realm of what Weill-Parot has termed \"addressative\" practices-by all standard Augustinian and Thomistic definitions, they are non­natural. 36 It is thus understandable that texts of ritual magic travel with works of naturalia far less often. Astrological image magic texts differ from ritual magic texts in a crucial structural way as well. The purpose of ritual magic texts is gen­erally intermediary: they do not tend to record truths about the world but rather to represent ritual practices by which contact with spirits may be facilitated in"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 353 order to attain truths about the world. Like all liturgies, ritual magic is highly subject to local need and local change. Finally, the authors of ritual magic texts were keenly aware that the magical library contained false or misleading textsY If works like the Liber Razielis tended to represent themselves as divinely re­vealed, they were still less the containers of truth than the divinely sanctioned means to discover it. Truth had to be discerned in practice and in encounters with the numinous, particularly angels, and the particular knowledge that might be derived would differ from person to person.38 A fifteenth-century necroman­cer's manual records necromantic processes in which emphasis is given to ques­tions rather than answers. When the spiryt is apperyd: What is thy name? Under what state and what dynite [i.e., dignity] hast thaw? What is thy powyr and thy offyse? Undyr what planet and sygn art thow. Of what parte arte thow of the world? Of which element art thow? Whych is thy monyth? What is thy day and thyn owyr? What is thyne howre, day or nyght? Whych is thy winde? What be they caretes that thaw abyst to? Whych is thy mansion and thy day? Which is thy sterre? Which is thy stone? Which is thy erbe? What is thyne offyse to do. What is thy metale? What is thyne Aungellys name that thaw moste obeyst to. And in what lykenes aperyst thow? How many commyst thow wythall?39 Similarly, the commonly occurring conjurations for any spirit suggest that users developed magical processes in response to whatever circumstances might arise in their operations, or using whatever new knowledge they might have gained through their practices. For example, it appears that Trithemius probably em­ployed angel magic to fill in the gaps as he wrote his Chronicle. 40 Truths were thus derived directly from experience of the numinous, from instruction by it, or from interrogating it, and this process of discovery both enabled and depended on a dynamic relationship with the texts, which were continuously being adapted to suit new needs. Even where ritual texts are handed on in recognizable forms and variants (e.g., in the case of the Ars notoria), practitioners appear to have understood ritual magic as a program of progressive, cumulative, and practical knowledge acquisition. It was understood that one had to learn how to perform ritual magic. The prologue to the Liber sacer requires that the understanding of the text be passed on in a kind of magical apprenticeship process, a holy brotherhood in which the master selects appropriate followers who ultimately may be given the right to take up his position and pass the knowledge on to others.41 John of Morigny talks explicitly about how he had to learn how to make the Ars notoria"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"354 INVOKING ANGELS work. 42 Part of this process may have been a kind of conditioning that made the practitioner more disposed or attentive to whatever psychological mechanisms the magic drew upon, such as dreams or trance states. But this learning process was also understood as practical and cumulative. For example, John appears to take it for granted that the natural result of having developed expertise in nec­romantic magic was to write a book on the subject.43 In part, the process also involved the development of critical skills in dealing with visionary experiences. When John of Morigny began practicing magic, he was unable to tell the differ­ence between holy and unholy presences, and he emphasized the need to re­quest assistance through prayer.44 Eventually, however, he was able to produce a detailed discussion of the ways in which one could do this.45 In summary, its practitioners did not regard ritual magic as part of the dis­course of Scholastic natural philosophy. Ritual magicians understood truth to be derived not fr om knowledge preserved in authoritative works but from expe­rience, practice, or interrogation of spirits. They understood this knowledge to be cumulatively amassed by the practitioner rather than to inhere in a preexisting set of authoritative pronouncements. They understood their relationship with their texts to be dynamic and susceptible to alteration or elucidation in the spiri­tual encounter. And finally, although their ritual processes were in part designed to overcome the deficiencies of the natural senses, nevertheless they were almost entirely dependent upon the senses for the acquisition of knowledge. These habits of mind may be witnessed in Gilbert's operations. Aside from some imagery that suggests an interest in alchemy, these operations display no interest in astrological image magic, other kinds of natural magic, or any of the Scholastic theories and debates associated with them. Gilbert and his associates did not regard the received traditions of magic as authoritative but employed them in a dynamic and interactive manner. Their advice that \"the master must also haue 1 or 2 good bookes to call by, as after you shall here fyende\" makes clear that one had to be discerning about the texts one chose; but they also evi­dently regarded their base text as something that might need to be corrected or more substantially transformed. They did not hesitate to make modifications where they saw fit. Some of these modifications were minor and were motivated by their own religious sensibilities. Some were considerable, involving the in­corporation of new operations or equipment prepared under the direction of the spirits. Perhaps more radically than their medieval forebears, the Gilberts under­stood their visions not only as a proof and tangible effect of the legitimacy of their operations but as experiences that were potentially an important source of raw data. Their attention to the intimate and seemingly inconsequential de­tails of the visions, and their efforts accurately to record them in an undigested"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 355 form, attest to their focus on experientially derived knowledge. The way they edited their texts, and their advice that the operator must work progressively, starting with lower demons and working upward, demonstrate that they re­garded knowledge of magic to be acquired cumulatively. In the end, they con­tributed to the ongoing transformations of medieval ritual magic by assembling and collecting their information in a new magical text. Magic and Science: Humphrey Gilbert's Academy In a 1994 book review, Brian Vickers criticized the tendency to regard Ficino and Pico as the epitome of Renaissance magic when the vast majority of con­temporary learned magic did not look at all like their \"intellectualist\" works.46 While there may be other problems with Vickers's theoretical frame, he was quite right to emphasize that practitioners of learned magic in the sixteenth century rarely looked like what readers of Frances Yates's works might be led to believe. The overwhelming majority of sixteenth-century manuscripts of high magic contain medieval works of ritual magic or reformulations of them. At the same time, the major medieval tradition of natural magic, often assumed to have been central to Renaissance magic (that is, astrological image magic), appears to have been in declineY Humphrey Gilbert's practices exemplify this trend, and we can use his example to answer Vickers's challenge, although perhaps in a way he would not have anticipated. As a practitioner of magic, Gilbert has no place in the traditional accounts of the relationship between magic and science in the Renaissance. Almost without exception, from the foundational work of Lynn Thorndike, through the chime­rical edifice of Frances Yates, to more recent work by Charles Webster, Deborah Harkness, John Henry, Stephen McKnight, Brian Copenhaver, and others, a focus upon natural philosophy and natural magic has precluded direct consid­eration of ritual magic. Most scholars continue to assume that the magical tra­ditions that Thorndike referred to as \"superstitious\" and that Yates derided as the \"old dirty\" magic of the Middle Ages declined and were superseded in the sixteenth century by a purified Renaissance magic, a form of magic emphasizing mathematics, focusing on the natural world and occult causation, or exhibiting \"science-friendly\" mythic structures.48 As a result, they have tended to focus almost entirely upon natural philosophy, natural magic, so-called Hermetic tra­ditions, astrological image magic, and kabbalism, particularly where they em­phasize number or geometry. If Humphrey cared about any of these things, they do not appear in his magical practices, which are very much in the tradition of the \"old dirty magic:' In fact, his magical genealogy (which does not even include"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"356 INVOKING ANGELS Hermes) makes dear that he and his companions understood Renaissance magic, at least as represented by Cornelius Agrippa and themselves, to belong to a tra­dition extending back through medieval ritual magic to the Old Testament pa­triarchs. Like his magic, Gilbert's proposal for a new academy was by no means revolutionary, but as an expression of common attitudes and approaches crucial to the development of modern science, it suggests a number of ways in which we may reorient our approach. The striking commonalities between his scientific and magical projects suggest that he conceived of them and approached them in very similar terms. Elizabeth's new academy was to be dedicated to the education of young no­blemen under the wardship of the Crown, but it was also to be open to others. In many ways, Gilbert's proposal simply reiterates standard humanist ideas (ar­guably elements in the development of modern science itself); he emphasizes worldly skills, advocates training the whole person, and rejects Scholasticism and Scholastic pedagogy. In other ways, his proposed academy moves beyond them. It would fund investigation of the natural world for practical purposes by combining theoretical and practical skills. One of its \"mathematicians\" was to be essentially a cosmographer with a heavy emphasis on navigation, and the other a military engineer with a large gunpowder budget for monthly practical demonstrations of ballistics. 49 Similarly, the physician would be required to sup­plement his traditional theoretical training by acquiring and practicing the skills of the apothecary and surgeon. This destruction of the traditional boundaries of professional practice also would include experimental and collaborative work. This phisition shall continuall practize togeather with the naturall phi­losophor, by the fire and otherwise, to search and try owt the secreats of nature, as many waies as they possiblie may. And shalbe sworne once euery yeare to deliuer into the Treasorer his office, faire, and plaine written in parchment, without Equiuocations or Enigmaticall phrases, vnder their handles, all those their proofes and trialles made within the forepassed yeare, Togeather with the true event of thinges, and all other necessary accidentes the way of their working, and the event thereof, t he better to follow the good, and avoyd the evill, which in time must of force bring great thinges to light, yf in Awcomistrie there be any such thinges hidden. 5° Far from the esoteric tendencies commonly attributed to enthusiasts of the occult, Gilbert does not appear sympathetic to the so-called Renaissance epis­teme but rather proposes to strip natural magic and alchemy of their poetic and philosophical language and place them in the cold light of practical experiment, close observation, and disinterested description. 51 Gilbert's proposal rejects tra-"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 357 ditional Scholastic pedagogy, Scholastic method, the old division of disciplines, and esoteric language; it promotes a critical dialogue with ancient sources; it sets experientially derived knowledge over authority as the standard for judging the received traditions; it sees the search for knowledge less as an engagement with a body of knowledge than as the assembling of the collection of known truths; it seeks to attain critical distance through careful observation and description of experimental processes; and it gives primacy to practical results. Iri all of these respects, Gilbert belongs firmly in the tradition of British thinkers leading up to Francis Bacon and reflects the shifts in thought crucial to the scientific revo­lution.52 Since he probably presented it to Elizabeth in I570, if Gilbert was not at work on his proposal when he was engaged in his magical operations, he cer­tainly undertook it very soon afterward. The practices and intellectual traditions of medieval ritual magic and Gil­bert's reformulations of them are very much in line with what we see in the proposal and with what makes it \"scientific\" in the modern sense. Peter Dear has suggested that one of the crucial differences between Scholastic natural philoso­phy and modern science is that the fo rmer considered itself a \"body of knowl­edge\" to be acquired, while the latter considered itself more of a \"research enter­prise.\"53 The \"research enterprise\" of Gilbert's ritual magic is remarkably similar to what we find in his more \"scientific\" endeavors. Ritual magic was as much an experientially fo cused methodology as a written tradition, was suspicious of received texts, and required knowledge to be established in a critical dialogue between received knowledge and experience, a dialogue in which the element of experience was primary. If ritual magic operators' circumspect attitude toward received traditions was still accompanied by the belief that men of the past, such as Adam and Solomon, had had privileged access to knowledge of the world, this was little different from Francis Bacon, who expressed similar ideas. Beyond this, ritual magic (again, unlike many forms of natural magic) was not fo und in Scholastic books, understood as a part of Scholastic discourse, or promoted by writers using warmed-over Scholastic arguments, so it may well have been at­tractive to those with anti-Scholastic sentiments. In short, medieval ritual magic texts had much to offer to the practical, experientially oriented, anti-Scholastic, independent-minded Humphrey Gilbert. It almost goes without saying that in many other crucial respects Gilbert's magic was not like modern science, and I don't wish to elide the differences be­tween his demon conjuring and Boyle's air pump. 54 At the same time, the mech­anistic models and systematic approaches of Bacon, Descartes, Boyle, and others had not yet been formulated, so it would be anachronistic to hold Gilbert's mag­ical exercises to their standards. Insofar as Gilbert's proposal for a new academy may be taken as representative of important new intellectual and social currents"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"358 INVOKING ANGELS that contributed to the rise of science, the medieval ritual magic he practiced may also be understood not only as amenable to them but even as \"scientific\" in its own right. At the very least, Humphrey Gilbert's story illustrates that the al­most universally held assumption that the \"old magic\" was in decline, uniformly represented \"regressive\" tendencies, or was incompatible with the new trends in science cannot be sustained. In fact, in many respects the forms of magic com­monly granted a kind of associate status in accounts of the scientific revolution would have been wrested from their theoretical settings and dismembered in Gilbert's academy, while ritual magic as a practice and method survived more or less intact in his hands, arguably becoming more scientific through an increased emphasis on description. In this sense, the learned magic of Gilbert, and later of Dee, need not, and in fact cannot, be squeezed into the narrow confines of natu­ral magic or of a putatively purified \"Renaissance magic:' and it cannot be un­derstood without reference to medieval traditions. In fact, in numerous ways ritual magic can be considered more \"scientific\" than natural magic traditions such as astrological image magic, whose associations with the increasingly anti­quated approaches of Scholastic thought remained strong. When the day was over and the conjurations had drawn to a close, Gilbert may well have decided that his magical operations led down a blind alley. Had he lived to see them, he might well have preferred the approaches of Boyle and his associates. But we will know a good deal more about sixteenth-century magic and science if we can understand why Humphrey Gilbert was inclined to walk among the spirits with his crystals, conjurations, and pen. Appendix: The Manuscript and the Question of Attribution The manuscript falls into two parts, the first containing instructions for opera­tions and the second, the record of visions attained (fols. 47r-57V and 58r-62v, respectively). In the second section, the master of the operation is identified as H. G. and the skryer as John Davis. Without question, Davis was not one of the scribes and, despite a cataloguer's identification, neither was Simon Forman.55 Gabriel Harvey's suggestion that the second might be the work of Thomas Smith seems very unlikely. 56 The manuscript does, however, provide as solid a link with the Gilbert household as paleography can afford. Adrian Gilbert is a credible candidate for the scribe of the first section. 57 The hand of the second section cannot be positively identified as Humphrey Gilbert's, but the possibility cannot be rejected either. It seems more likely, however, that the manuscript was writ­ten by a secretary, something that would have been in keeping with Humphrey's habits. The vast majority of his surviving correspondence and works were not"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"RITUAL INVOCATION AND EARLY MODERN SCIENCE 3 5 9 written in his own hand. Such a scenario is borne out by the corrections to the second portion, which were probably made by the scribe of the first section. In addition, many of the errors suggest that the second section was copied, per­haps from more informal notes, in preparation for a final, formal copy. Many of the errors are difficult to account for except as misreadings in copying. We find, for example, \"shyll\" expunged and \"hill\" written in (59v) and \"a loud streake of golde\" corrected to \"a longe streake of gold\" (6ov). More tellingly, accidental duplication of words also recurs, such as the duplication of \"apereth\" (6ov) and \"help\" (6or). In short, the paleographic evidence tends to favor attribution to the Gilbert household and certainly cannot be used to reject this thesis. Circumstantial evidence for this attribution, however, is powerful. Humphrey Gilbert was in England at the time these operations are said to have taken place. His known brutality in arms matches the character ofH.G., who takes great rel­ish in cursing and abusing demons in the operations and whose engagements with them are presented entirely in military terms, something not typical in nec­romantic literature. He rides into armies of demons, cutting them down with his sword. As noted in the first paragraph, the operations took place at a time when Humphrey was undertaking important new directions in his life; the concern for the future reflected in the manuscript appears to bear this out. 58 The descrip­tions of the skryer also correspond well with the John Davis who would become the navigator. Davis, the son of a local family and protege of the Gilbert house­hold, would certainly have been familiar to the household and was of an age when he could have been expected to be living there for long periods of time. At seventeen, John Davis would have been older than the boys traditionally used in medieval skrying, but the old requirement of virginity and sexual purity appears to have become less crucial in sixteenth-century operations, perhaps under the influence of Protestantism, but also potentially due to a declericalization of ritual magic. The descriptions of the skryer in the visions suggest a youth rather than a prepubescent boy.59 As discussed below, both Davis and Adrian Gilbert were heavily involved in magical operations, and Adrian with alchemy. 60 So each of the known figures corresponds well with what appears in the manuscript. Perhaps most convincing of all, Humphrey, Adrian, and John were evidently part of a circle of practitioners associated with John Dee, whose magical opera­tions and note taking greatly resemble theirs. Their interaction with Dee cer­tainly involved questions of navigation, exploration, cartography, metallurgy, mining, and the associated business interests, and nothing in the records of Humphrey's visits suggests that the topics of discussion involved magic. 61 John and Adrian's dealings with Dee, however, had as much if not more to do with magic. In his diary Dee notes that in 1583 he reconciled some difference he had with them, occasioned by William Emery. He also notes Davis's dislike for the"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"360 INVOKING ANGELS skryer. Adrian was also evidently fa miliar enough with Dee's household to have mediated a conflict between Dee's wife and his skryer, Edward Kelly, and was involved in some of Dee's early operations with Kelly. 62 1heir evident fa miliarity with Dee's circle of magical practitioners appears to have been even more long­standing than the diary suggests. A note by John Dee dated 1568 indicates that he had determined, through magic, and with the assistance of William Emery, the date of John Davis's birth.63 It would have been very unlikely that he came to know the Devon teenager unless through the Gilbert household, and the fa ct that he could not just ask for the information makes clear that Davis was not in the environs of Mortlake. That Dee inquired about Davis shortly after the operations recorded in Additional 36674 suggests that Dee was aware of them and of Davis's role. In fa ct, one wonders whether the conflict between Davis and Emery was a matter of professional competition between two skryers. In summary, although no individual piece of evidence incontrovertibly con­nects Additional 36674 with the Gilbert household, the overwhelming weight of circumstantial evidence leads me to attribute it to John Davis, Adrian Gilbert, and Humphrey Gilbert. That Humphrey does not appear to have been involved in Dee's magical operations at the time of his first recorded visits to Mortlake may suggest that his interest in them had waned by that time. It is nonetheless interesting that Gilbert's posthumous portrait, which now hangs in his ancestral home at Compton, includes a stylized combination of the astrological sigils for Mercury and Mars (remarkably suited to the martial and mercurial Humphrey), which looks a great deal like the hieroglyphic monad of John Dee. Even to the end of his life, he was evidently fashioning himself as a man of esoteric interests. NOTES 1. This shift in orientation is very widespread, so I can cite only a small fraction of the literature salient to the present discussion. The social organization of science has been the subject of numerous studies. See Jantes E. McClellan III, Science Reorganized: Scientific Societies in the Eighteenth Century (New Yo rk: Columbia University Press, 1985); and Michael Hunter, Establishing the New Science: 1he Experience of the Early Royal Society (Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, 1989). The social uses and con­struction of science or scientific truth have been ex;antined in a variety of ways. Steven Shapin has argued that since it was rarely possible to verify experimental results, their presentation had to draw upon social constructs of honor and dependability. See Shapin, A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994). Eric H. Ash discusses the development of the role of the \"expert mediator\" in the sixteenth century and how it laid the groundwork for Bacon's conception of himself and of the role of the experimental scientist. See Ash, Power, Knowledge, and Expertise in Elizabethan England (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2.004). Anthony Grafton and others have discussed the context and influence of humanism. See Anthony Grafton and Nancy G. Siraisi, Natural Pa rticulars: Na ture and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999). Numerous studies have concerned themselves with the ways in which experience was valorized, understood, and warranted.

The interest in alchemy and ritual magic evident in a considerable number of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century scribes and manuscript collectors, as well as well-known figures like Adrian Gilbert, John Dee, and Simon Fore­man, was not common before 1500. I plan to explore the significance ofthis change in a future article. 4· Charles We bster epitomizes this view, arguing that \"popular operative magic:• or \"magic as the performance of rituals aimed at controlling fo rces held responsible for the succession of events,\" slowly fell into abeyance among the intellectual elite, but that the idea that \"the magus might unlock the potential of occult qualities through exploiting natural magic\" persisted through the seventeenth century. His subsequent discussion focuses almost entirely on the relationship between natural magic and medicine. He is to be commended, however, for insisting that dualities such as \"hermetic\" vs. \"scientific\" are anachronistic. Charles Webster,l'rom Pa racelsus to Newton: Magic and the Making of Modem Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), 11-12. John Henry expresses a simi­lar perspective: \"Magic is not a monolithic subject and it is important to stress that major aspects of the history of magic seem to play no role in the rise of modern science, for example, demonic magic, chiromancy, and Kabbalah. The crucial aspects of the magical tradition for the historian of science were those encompassed by the term Natural Magic, which embraced all those arts which relied upon natural lore; for example, astrology and alchemy:· John Henry, \"Magic and Science in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century,\" in Companion to the History of Modern Science, ed. Robert C. Olby (Lon­don: Routledge, 1990 ), 586. This perspective is reflected in most general considerations of the subject.

The most common method for magically acquiring learning and wisdom was the Ars notoria, discussed at length elsewhere in this volume. 'Ihe conjuring manual edited and analf2ed by Richard Kieckhefer also contains a necromantic analogue to the Ars notoria in which demons rather than an­gels are invoked.

INVOKING ANGELS 13. For example, although the vast majority of the instructions are given over to conjurations, threats, and commands for demons like Azazel, the spirits of the dead consent to help. They also ap­pear to consent to being \"bound\" in some way, although the specifics of this arrangement are not clear. London, British Library, Additional 36674. fo l. 59V. For a typical combination of demonic and angelic operations, see Bodleian, Rawlinson D. 252. 14. It was commonly assumed that one could not conjure under cloudy conditions, and although conjuring at night was possible, it appears that working during the day was generally considered pref­erable. A roughly contemporary conjuring manual puts it like this: \"Habe aerem clarum et non nubi­losum quia sol magna habet influentia in spiritibus et appetetunt in radiis solaribus apparere et oper­ari:' London, British Library, Sloane 3318, fo l. 2v. See also London, British Library, Sloan 3853, fol. 1ov. 1he appearance of clouds demanded that the operations be abandoned. See Bodleian, Rawlinson D. 252, fo ls. 30V-31r. Certainly, clear atmospheric conditions were necessary for crystallomantic opera­tions. \"Tunc in loco secreto et honesto aere sereno.\" Rawlinson D. 252, fol. 114v. 15. The notion that one could trap or somehow contain a spirit in a crystal occurs in numerous texts. See, for example, Bodleian, Rawlinson D. 252, fo ls. 42v-44v, and Va ticano ( Citta del), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Pal. lat. 1375, fo ls. 269v-270r. The fo urteenth-century catalogue of the books of John Erghome of the Austin Friars at York includes a tract on enclosing a spirit in a mirror. See K. W. Humphreys, ed., The Friars' Libmries (London: British Library, 1990 ), 87-88. 16. Medieval necromantic operations using various skrying surfaces commonly required virgin boys and sometimes girls. On virginity as a requirement in such texts, see Claire Fanger, \"Virgin Ter­ritory: Purity and Divine Knowledge in Late Medieval Catoptromantic Texts,\" Aries 5. no. 2 (2005): 200-225. Anecdotal evidence of this practice may be fo und in the writings of John of Salisbury, who recounts being employed for this purpose as a boy. John of Salisbury, Frivolities of Courtiers and Foot­prints of Philosophers, trans. Joseph B. Pike (London: Oxford University Press, 1938), 146-47. An ex­periment for seeing spirits with a boy skryer appears in the fifteenth-century commonplace book of Robert Reynes. See The Commonplace Book of Rober! Reynes of Acle; An Edition of Ta nner MS 407. ed. Cameron Louis (London: Garland, 1980), 169, quoted in Kieckhefer, Forbidden Rites, 97· Extensive and numerous operations using various skrying devices and young boys or girls occur in Bodleian, Rawl­inson D. 252; see, for example, fo ls. 1r-29V. The notion that certain spiritual capacities were afforded by chastity appears to have motivated this, so it is not surprising that older skryers became common after the Reformation. John Dec's skryers were uniformly adult males, with the exception of a brief period when he attempted to employ his son Arthur. See Deborah E. Harkness, John Dees Conversations with Angels: Cabala, Alchemy. and the End of Nature (Cambridge: Cambridge University PreS6, 1999), 16-26. 17. Although the name appears to have Babylonian roots, the story of Azazel derives from Leviti­cus 16:7-28. Agrippa tells us that kabbalist sources identify A7.azel as king of the south, one of the four kings of the cardinal directions (Cornelius Agrippa, De occulta philasoplria libri tres, ed. Vittoria Per­rone Compagni [Leiden: Brill, 1992], II1.24). Azazel is one of the fa llen angels in Jewish traditions. Although \"fastened to the mountain of darkness\" and willing to teach witchcraft to those who seek his help, Azazel does not appear to have any particular association with spirits of the dead. See Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 7 vols. (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1909), 1:126, 148-52; 5:123, 152, 171, 3n, and 416. Pico, drawing on kabbalist sources, describes Azazel as one who devours those practicing bad magic, but otherwise the demon appears to have no singular con­nection with spirits of the dead in general. On Pico's discussion, see Brian P. Copenhaver, \"Number, Shape, and Meaning in Pico's Christian Cabala: The Upright Tsade, the Closed Mem, and the Gaping Jaws of Azazel; in Grafton and Siraisi, Natural Particulars, 46-47, 72. Although not connected explic­itl y with the dead, Azazel appears in more extensive narratives in the book of Enoch, 9-11, 13, and 54-55, and 69-70. Whatever the earlier sources for this tradition may have been, the Gilberts' immedi­ate sources for this operation were undoubtedly late medieval British necromantic manuals. Rituals fo r speaking with the dead occur in a variety of necromantic sources and appear as early as the fif­teenth century. See Oxford, Bodleian Library, Ballard 66, fo ls. 33-39 (s.xvii); London, British Library, Sloane 3884, fo ls. 47-56 (s.xvi); and Bodleian, Rawlinson D. 252 (s.xv.), fo ls. 66v-68r. Rawlinson D. 152 conjures \"A sacel.\" Interestingly, it is fo llowed by another operation for \"Azoel,\" which may be the same as \"A osal,\" the other spirit mentioned in the Gilbert manual (fol. sov). Ginzberg identifies Azza7.el and Azzael as one and the same. Legends of the Jews, 5:151. 18. For the record of Humphrey Gilbert performing this operation, see fol. 62r.

Agrippa also lists these fo ur names as princes of the devils in De occulta philosophia, II.7 and IIL24. 19. Any medieval work of necromantic magic always mentioned Mary at one point or another. Her complete absence from this manuscript is thus notable. On the other hand, the text reflects the slow and initially superficial nature of the changes in this period. The intervention ofJohn the Baptist and Saint Luke certainly suggests continuities with Catholic invocation of the saints and belief in inter­cession. On the notion that Protestantism brought about a decline of magic, see Keith Vivian Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (New Yo rk: Scribner, 1971). Eamon Duffy is largely silent about Thomas's arguments, although he explicitly criticizes Thomas for his assumption that the sacraments \"were credited with an inexorable and compelling power\" only at a popular level. Duffy, The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, c. 1400-c. 1580 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), 277. Duffy argues instead that much of what Thomas calls superstition or magic was a legitimate fo rm of religious devotion practiced by all levels of English society. For Duffy's discussion of these fo rms of devotion in Protestant England, see 379-593. Robert Scribner's recent work includes useful critiques of Thomas. See Robert W. Scribner, \"The Reformation, Popular Magic, and the 'Disenchantment of the Wo rld:\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History 23, no. 3 (1993): 475-94; and \"Magic and the Formation of Protestant Popular Culture in Germany,\" in Religion and Culture in Germany (1400-18oo), ed.

For example, a prayer extracted from the Solomonic Ars notoria in British Library, Sloane 3853 adopts a similar rhetorical strategy by emphasizing that the magician understood his work to be part of God's greater purposes. \"Et tu, qui es deus meus, qui in principio creasti celum et terram et omnia ex nichilo, qui in spiritu tuo omnia reformas, comple, instaura, sana animam meam, ut glorificem te per omnia opera cogitationum mearum et verborum meorum.

So they tend to support themselves on religious and biblical authority, rather than the author­ity of natural philosophy; for example, the Bible recounts how Christians could cast out demons in Christ's name and non-Christians could not. Similarly, being an orthodox Christian was an essential element in performing successful ritual magic. The Liber sacer tells of how the Jews cannot perform magic. Liber iuratus, III.2o (Hedegard, 66). A late medieval necromancer's manual provides the Apos­tles' and Athanasian Creeds to help the operator remain orthodox. Bodleian, Rawlinson D. 252., fo ls. 8u-82v. The dependence of ritual magic on Christian rites is self-evident. This is quite different from the use of intention as an element in image magic, which is commonly divorced from the moral and religious condition of the practitioner. For the term \"addressative,\" see notes to the opening pages of Weill-Parot's chapter in this volume. 37. 1hat a magical figure might be secretly demonic or that a magical text presented itself as astro­logically based when it was really necromantic certainly concerned Scholastic readers of astrological image magic but was not an explicit concern of the authors. The Liber sacer recounts that its author had produced it by extracting the flowers of wisdom from seven volumes of magic for the good magi­cians. It also recounts that \"others» were given empty husks. \"Qui consulente angelo Hocrohel nomine 7 volumina artis magice deffioravit nobis florem accipiens et aliis cortices dimittendo'' (Liber iuratus, !.16). It is not clear whether this means that Honorius intentionally wrote false magical works to de­ceive the ignorant, that he found fa lse and empty portions of the original volumes that he somehow left behind, or simply that by removing crucial sections he left behind works denuded of their wisdom. But there is no doubt that the author undentood the magical library to be polluted by these \"husks:' John of Morigny, the victim of such a false text, discovered that when he used prayers in the Ars noto­ria he was unknowingly invoking demons rather than angels (Liber visionum, 19, \"Prologue;' trans. and ed. Fanger and Watson, 181). Curiously, the \"false» nature of this text was not a barrier to the discovery of truth through it. 38. 1hc Liber Razielis gives a long list of the Old Testament patriarchs who employed it. Each of them is said to have derived something different from the volume. Miinchen, Bayerische Staatsbiblio­thek, Clm 51, fol. mv. For an interesting parallel to this process, see the discussion of astrological prognostication in Madagascar by M. Bloch. Bloch argues that the presence of stable astrological texts did not serve to stabilize interpretive systems but actually increased their diversity. M.

The Liber iuratus Honorii describes a small group of scholars and disciples knitted together by a master. They swear mutual loyalty and protection.

Astrological image magic declined sharply after 1500 as an independent genre and in manu­script copies made by specialists. This cannot be attributed simply to the availability of printed texts, since the copying of ritual magic texts increased despite the presence of printed works. See Klaassen, \"Medieval Ritual Magic,» 48. On the \"old dirty� magic, see Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tra dition (Chi­cago: University of Chicago Press, 1964), So-81. The many studies of Brian Copenhaver are exemplary. On the subject of magic and science, see his \"Natural Magic, Hermeticism, and Occultism in Early Modern Science,� in Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, ed. David C. Lindberg and Robert S. Westman (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990); \"Scholastic Philosophy and Renaissance Magic\"; and \"A Tale of Two Fishes: Magical Objects in Natural History from Antiquity Through the Scientific Revolution;' Journal of the History of Ideas 52, no. 3 (1991). Harkness's first-rate study of Dee, John Dee's Conversations with Angels, connects Dee's angel magic with his natural philosophy but seeks to distinguish it from the ritual magic traditions in general. Surprisingly, she cites British Library, Ad­ditional 36674 but does not make any mention of the close affinities with the practices of John Dee. Stephen McKnight seeks to demonstrate the influence of mythologies of\"pseudo-science\" on science, but he concentrates entirely upon Hermetic and Neoplatonic mythologies and seems to regard Solo­monic myths as belonging to that tradition. See his \"Science, the Prisci ·nieologia, and Modern Epochal Consciousness,� in Science, Pseudo-Science, and Utopianism in Early Modern Thought, ed. Stephen A. McKnight (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1992), 88-117. Charles Webster argues for a decline in ritual magic and the persistence of natural magic through the seventeenth century, and John Henry discounts any possible connection between the new science and ritual magic.

More crucially, practitioners do not display the preoccupations with method or \"rules of engagement\" characteristic of seventeenth-century scientists. Ritual magic also did not focus solely on the natural world, nor does it seem to have encouraged a mechanical view of nature. Seventeenth-century science would also ultimately reject ritual magic in the strongest terms. 55. A note of the first folio of the first section notes that in 1868 Mr. McKray of the Bodleian Li­brary identified the hand of the first section as that of Simon Forman, the well-known late sixteenth­century doctor, astrologer, and magician. However, assuming the date is correct, he would have been only seventeen in 1576, and in any event this is certainly not Forman's distinctive hand. See fo l. 47r.

On October 12, 1566, he was sent back from military service in Ireland with dispatches for Queen Elizabeth. As his biographer William Gosling notes, \"no clear purpose seems to have moti­vated Sir Henry Sidney to order his return to England. Neither the dispatches nor the news he carried were of such paramount importance as to require a messenger of his calibre; and we are therefore obliged to conclude that he had obtained leave of absence from the army to return to England for some private purposes of his own, and that Sidney merely took advantage of his departure to send dispatches to the Queen.\" Gosling goes on to suggest that he took leave to petition Elizabeth for as­sistance in an expedition to find the Northwest Passage. This project dominated his energies over the ensuing decades. William Gilbert Gosling, The Life of Sir Humphrey Gilbert: England's First Empire Builder (London: Constable, 1911), 39-40. 59. For example, Solomon requires that the skryer be dressed like the master, in a black coat and cloak. See fo l. 6or.

Adrian's \"chemical\" interests were well known, and he was supported by Mary Sidney as an instructor in the art.

In the margin of a table of star positions, he scribbled a note, dated May l2, 1568, that he had learned the exact time and date ofJohn Davis's birth \"by magic\" at Mortlake, with the help of William Emery. Although it is unclear what the fo rm of their magic might have been, the fact that Emery later worked as Dee's skryer suggests that it was probably a crystal-gazing operation.
