Turner translates a Latinversion published by Agrippa fifty years earlier. While many earlier Latin versionsare referenced by scholars – some from as early as the 13th century – no one has as yettaken the time to produce an updated English rendition of the work, or to fully com-pare Agrippa’s version with the earlier versions. The foundation and essence of the practices described in the Ars Notoria lies inthe figures or “notes” that give it its title. These consist partly of realistic illustrations,partly of sigils and signs similar to other grimoires of the day, and partly of text,which winds into and around the graphical elements. When used as objects ofcontemplation (or in a more active use of visual imagination) the notes are said toplace the user’s mind in a state in which it is granted complete knowledge or skill inone of the seven Liberal Arts. Unfortunately, Turner’s translation did not includethese figures. Photographs of several notes can be found in Visual Art in Two Manuscripts ofthe Ars Notoria, by Michael Camille, published in Conjuring Spirits: Texts and Tradi-tions of Medieval Ritual Magic, edited by Claire Fanger, published by the Pennsylva-nia State University Press. According to Dr. Fanger, there are at least threestylistically distinct sets of notes to be found among the Latin manuscripts of theNotoria. No one set is considered definitive.The text instructs the practioner to “look into” or “inspect” the note with whichhe is working several times a day, and to recite certain prayers and magickal namesduring a portion of those occasions. The specific prayers and names are integratedinto the visual portion of the note in some instances, and it is not known whetherthese integrated prayers are among the many translated by Turner. What is actually meant by “inspect” is obscure. The Latin word, inspicio, hasessentially the same range of meanings as the modern English word; none of themare informative in the context. But the text mentions several times that visions are apart of the process of use, without explaining exactly how they are involved; and thesection quoted below suggests that something more than close examination isintended.And know this; that if thou hast not the books in thy hands, or the faculty oflooking into them is not given to thee; the effe\u0001 of this work will not be thelesse therefore: but the Orations are twice then to be pronounced, wherethey were to be but once: And as to the knowledge of a vision, and the othervirtues which these Holy Orations have; thou maist prove and try them,when and how thou wilt.So it would seem that a specific skill or ability is involved, a “faculty of inspec-tion”. Perhaps this was simply the ability to memorize the image and visualize it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"iiwhile reciting the orations. The monk John of Morigny, who practiced the Ars Noto-ria to some effect, later used such visualization in his own system of religious magic.Such techniques were generally known at the time, from various systems for improv-ing the memory. Or possibly the technique was similar to those used by modernmagicians to obtain a vision related to a specific symbol, by using it as a “gate” in theimagination, and entering into an astral world that embodies the meaning of thesymbol. In any case, the author of the Notoria seems confident that one can get bywithout such skill if necessary; the Prayers alone, said with sufficient fervor and rep-etition, will produce the same results.The book is divided into three sections. The first of these deals with what theauthor calls “generals”; these are abilities of broad application – memory, eloquence,understanding and perseverance – which need to be developed before the practitionerworks to obtain the particular skills of one of the Liberal Arts. These latter he refersto as the “specials”. The section mixes commentary with prayers that are to be used toobtain the abilities, in a manner that is somewhat difficult to follow. (It should benoted that only an abbreviated form of some prayers is given. )The second section deals with the “specials”, giving prayers in sequence for eachof the Liberal Arts, in the order in which they were customarily taught. The Notesall relate to this section of the book; each prayer is accompanied by instructions onthe use of the proper note, and some small amount of commentary.The third section presents some prayers that were allegedly given to Solomon ata different time than those of the previous sections. However, most of these prayersare those already referenced in Part I, save that they are given here in full. The focusof this section is again on the “generals”, though the technique described varies insome respect from those previously given. Dr. Fanger and others have speculated thatthis section was a variant of Part I, which perhaps had originally been circulated sep-arately, and later incorporated in the Ars Notoria for its greater detail.None of these sections are clearly distinguished in the text, which can lead to agreat deal of confusion as instructions in one section seem to conflict with those inanother. The start of each section has therefore been marked by a footnote.The text of this edition was transcribed directly from a photocopy of Turner’sfirst edition, published in 1657. Even by the standards of the time, the book was not agreat example of the typographer’s art; it was cheaply printed, and was clearly typesetby three different people, each with their own notions of what constituted good textlayout, and of what constituted proper spelling of English. For the overall layout ofthis edition, I have selected elements from each of their styles, but use them consis-tently throughout the text. The punctuation, and the spelling, capitalization andemphasis of individual words have been left as in the original. The exception is that Ihave not followed the 17th-century practice of substituting the letter “f” for “s”,believing that doing so would greatly reduce the readability of the text. The errorsthat have crept into recent printed editions (particularly the edition issued by the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"iiiHolmes Publishing Group) are not present, although no doubt there are new errorsof my own devising. Several elided passages have been restored. Two additional articles present in the 1657 edition are not included here. Thefirst of these, A Certain Magnetick Experiment, describes a device for long-distancecommunication based on an imaginary property of magnetized iron. The second, AnAstrological Catechisme, is a translation of a Latin document by Leovitius, partiallyrewritten by Turner. It presents a series of questions and answers concerning astrol-ogy and its practice.Benjamin RoweJune 30, 1999"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Ars Notoria:THENOTORY ARTOFSOLOMONShewing theCABALISTICAL KEYMagical OperationsThe liberal SciencesDivine Revelation, andThe Art of Memory.Written originally in Latine, and now Englished by Robert TurnerLondon, Printed by F.

In the first place there-fore, we shall declare certain Precepts of the Spiritual Sciences; that all things whichwe intend to speak of, may be attained to in order. Wonder not therefore, at what youshall hear and see in this subsequent Treatise, and that you shall find an Example ofsuch inestimable Learning.Some things which follow, which we will deliver to thee as Essayes of wonderfulEffe\u0001s, and have extra\u0001ed them out of the most Ancient Books of the Hebrews;which, where thou seest them, (although they are forgotten, and worn out of anyhumane Language) nevertheless esteem them as Miracles: For I do truly admire thegreat Power and Efficacy of Words in the Works of Nature.Of what Efficacy Words are.There is so great Virtue, Power and Efficacy in certain Names and Words of God,that when you read those very Words, it shall immediately increase and help yourEloquence, so that you shall be made Eloquent of Speech by them, and at lengthattain to the Effe\u0001s of the powerful Sacred Names of God; but from whence thepower hereof doth proceed, shall be fully demonstrated to you in the followingChapters of Prayers: And those which follow next to our hand, we shall lay it open.An Explanation of the Notary Art.This Art is divided into two parts: the first containeth general Rules, the second spe-cial Rules. We come first to the special Rules, that is, First, to a threefold, and thento a fourfold Division: And in the third place we come to speak of Theologie; whichSciences thou shalt attain to, by the Operations of these Orations, if thou pronouncethem as it is written: therefore there are certain Notes of the Notary Art, which aremanifest to us; the Virtue whereof Humane Reason cannot apprehend. The firstNote hath his signification taken from the Hebrew; which though the expressionthereof be comprehended in a very few words; nevertheless, in the expression of theMystery, they do not lose their Vertue: That may be called their Vertue, which dothhappen and proceed from their pronunciation, which ought to be greatly admired at."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"7The first Precept.Hely, Scemath Amazaz, Hemel, Sathusteon, hheli Tamazam, &cet. which Solomon enti-tled, His First Revelation; and that to be without any Interpretation: It being a Sci-ence of so Transcendent a purity, that it hath its Original out of the depth andprofundity of the Chaldee, Hebrew, and Grecian Languages; and therefore cannotpossible by any means be explicated fully in the poor Thread-bare Scheme of ourLanguage. And of what nature the Efficacy of the aforesaid words are, Solomon him-self doth describe in his Eleventh Book, Helisoe, of the Mighty Glory of the Creator:But the Friend and Successor of Solomon, that is, Apollonius, with some few others, towhom that Science hath been manifested, have explained the same, and defined it tobe most Holy, Divine, Deep, and Profound Mysteries; and not to be disclosed norpronounced, without great Faith and reverence.A Spiritual Mandate of the precedent Oration.Before any one is to reade or pronounce any Orations of this Art, to bring them toEffe\u0001, let them always first reverently and devoutly rehearse the Prayer in the begin-ning. If any one will search the Scriptures, or would understand, or eloquently pro-nounce any part of Scripture, let him pronounce the words of the following Figure,to wit, Hely Scemath, in the morning betimes of that day, wherein thou wilt begin anywork. And in the Name of the Lord our God, let him diligently pronounce theScripture proposed, with this Prayer which follows, which is, Theos Megale; And ismystically distorted, and miraculously and properly framed out of the Hebrew, Greek,and Chaldee Tongues, and it extendeth itself briefly into every Language, in whatbeginning soever they are declared. The second part of the Oration of the secondChapter, is taken out of the Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldee; and the following Expos-tion thereof ought to be pronounced first, which is a Latine Oration: The third Ora-tion of the three Chapters, always in the beginning of every faculty, is first to berehearsed.The Oration is, Theos Megthe, in tu yma Eurel, &cet..This sheweth, how the foregoing Prayer is expounded: But although this is aparticular and brief Expostion of this Oration; yet do not think, that all words arethus expounded.The Exposition of this Oration.Oh God, the Light of the World, Father of Immense Eternity, Giver of all Wisdomand Knowledge, and of all Spiritual Grace: most Holy and Inestimable Dispenser,knowing all things before they are made; who makest Light and Darkness: Stretchforth thy Hand, and touch my Mouth, and make my tongue as a sharp sword, toshew forth these words with eloquence; Make my Tongue as an Arrow ele\u0001ed todeclare thy Wonders, and to pronounce them memorably: Send forth thy holy"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8Spirit, O Lord, into my Heart and Soul, to understand and retain them, and tomeditate on them in my Conscience: By the Oath of thy Heart, that is, By theRight-hand of thy holy Knowledge, and mercifully inspire thy Grace into me; Teachand instru\u0001 me; Establish the coming in and going out of my Senses, and let thyPrecepts teach and corre\u0001 me until the end; and let the Counsel of the most Highassist me, through thy infinite Wisdom and Mercy. Amen.The words of these Orations cannot wholly be Expounded.Neither think, that all words of the preceding Oration can be translated into the Lat-ine Tongue: for some words of that Oration contain in themselves a greater Sense ofMystical Profundity, of the Authority of Solomon; and having reference to his Writ-ings, we acknowledge; That these Orations cannot be expounded nor understood, byhumane sense: For it is necessary, That all Orations, and distin\u0001 particulars ofAstronomy, Astrology, and the Notory Art, be spoken and pronounced in their duetime and season; and the Operations of them to be made according to the dispositionof the Times.Of the Triumphal Figures, how Sparingly they are to be pronounced,and honestly and devoutly Spoken.There are also certain Figures or Orations which Solomon in Chaldeack called, Hely;that is, Triumphal Orations of the Liberal Arts, and sudden excellent Efficacies ofVertues; and they are the Introdu\u0001ion to the Notory Art. Wherefore Solomon made aspecial beginning of them, that they are to be pronounced at certain determinatetimes of the Moon; and not to be undertaken, without consideration of the end.Which also Magister Apollonius hath fully and perfe\u0001ly taught, saying, Whosoeverwill pronounce these words, let him do it in a determinate appointed time, and setaside all other occasions, and he shall profit in all Sciences in one Moneth, and attainto them in an extraordinary wonderful manner.The Expositions of the Lunations of the Notary Art.These are the Expositions of the Lunation, and the Introdu\u0001ion of the Notory Art,to wit, in the fourth and the eighth day of the Moon; and in the twelfth, sixteenth,four and twentieth, eight and twentieth, and thirteenth they ought to be put inoperation. From whence Solomon saith, That to those times, we give the expositivetimes of the Moon; of the fourth day of the Moon, which are written by the fourAngels; and in the fourth day of the Moon is manifested to us; and are four timesrepeated and explained by the Angel, the Messenger of these Orations; and are alsorevealed and delivered to us that require them from the Angel, four times of theyear, to shew the Eloquence and Fulness of the four Languages, Greek, Hebrew,Chaldee and Latine; and God hath determined the Power of the Faculties ofHumane Understanding, to the four Parts of the Earth; and also the four Vertues of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"9Humanities, Understanding, Memory, Eloquence, and the Faculty of Ruling thosethree. And these things are to be used as we have before spoken.He sheweth how the precedent Oration is the Beginning and Foundation of the whole Art.That is the first Figure of the Notory Art, which is manifestly sited upon a Quadran-gle Note: And this is Angelical Wisdom, understood of few in Astronomy; but in theGlass of Astrology, it is called, The Ring of Philosophy; and in the Notory Art it iswritten, To be the Foundation of the whole Science. But it is to be rehearsed fourtimes a day, beginning in the morning once, about the third hour once, once in theninth hour, and once in the evening.The precedent Oration ought to be spoken secretly; and let him that speaks itbe alone, and pronounce it with a low voyce, so that he scarcely hear himself. Andthis is the condition hereof, that if necessity urge one to do any great works, he shallsay it twice in the morning, and about the ninth hour twice; and let him fast the firstday wherein he rehearseth it, and let him chastly and devoutly. And this is the Ora-tion which he shall say:This is the Oration of the four Tongues, Chaldee, Greek, Hebrew and Latine,evidently expounded, which is called, The Splendor or Speculum of Wisdom. In allholy Lunations, these Orations ought to be read, once in the morning, once aboutthe third hour, and once in the evening.The Oration.Assaylemath, Assay, Lemath, Azzabue.The second part of the precedent Orations, which is to be said only once.Azzaylemath, Lemath, Azacgessenio.The third part of the precedent Oration, which is to be spoken together with the other.Lemath, Sabanche, Ellithy, Aygezo.This Oration hath no Exposition in the Latine.This is a holy Prayer, without danger of any sin, which Solomon saith, is inexplicableby humane sense. And he addeth, and saith, That the Explication thereof is moreprolixious, than can be considered of or apprehended by Man; excepting also thosesecrets, which is not lawful, neither is it given to Man to utter: Therefore he leaveththis Oration without Exposition, because no Man could attain to the perfe\u0001ionthereof: and it was left so spiritual, because the Angel that declared it to Solomon, laidan inexcusable prohibition upon it, saying, See that thou do not presume to give toany other, not to expound anything out of this Oration, neither thy self, nor anyoneby thee, nor anyone after thee: For it is a holy and Sacramental Mystery, that byexpressing the words thereof, God heareth thy Prayer, and increaseth thy Memory,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10Understanding, Eloquence, and establisheth them all in thee.

Apollonius ter-meth it, The Light of the Soul, and the Speculum of Wisdom: And, I suppose, thesaid Oration may be called, The Image of Eternal Life; the Vertue and Efficacywhereof is so great, that is understood or apprehended of by very few or none.Therefore having essayed some Petitions, Signs and Precepts, we give them asan entrance to those things thereof we intended to speak; of which they are part, thatwe have spoken of before. Nevertheless, before we come to speak of them, somethings are necessary to be declared, whereby we may more clearly and plainly setforth our intended History: For, as we have said before, there are certain Exceptionsof the Notory Art; some whereof are dark and obscure, and others plain and mani-fest.For the Notory Art hath a Book in Astronomy, whereof it is the Beginning andMistriss; and the Vertue thereof is such, that all Arts are taught and derived from her.And we are further to know, that the Notory Art doth in a wonderful manner con-tain and comprehend within it self, all Arts, and the Knowledge of all Learning, asSolomon witnesseth: Therefore it is called, The Notary Art, because in certain briefNotes, it teacheth and comprehendeth the Knowledge of all Arts: for so Solomon alsosaith in his Treatise Lemegeton, that is, in his Treatise of Spiritual and Secret Experi-ments.Here he Sheweth, in what manner these Notes differ in Art, and the Reason thereof;for a Note is a certain knowledge, by the Oration and Figure before set down.But of the Orations and Figures, mention shall be made in their due place, and howthe Notes are called in the Notory Art. Now he maketh mention of that Oration,which is called, The Queen of Tongues: for amongst these Orations, there is moreexcellent than the rest, which King Solomon would therefore have be called, TheQueen of Tongues because it takes away, as it were, with a certain Secret covering theImpediments of the Tongue, and giveth it a marvellous Faculty of Eloquence.Wherefore before we proceed further, take a little Essay of that Oration: For this isan Oration which in the Scriptures we are taught to have alwayes in our mouthes; butit is taken out of the Chaldean Language: which, although it be short, is of a wonder-ful Vertue; that when you reade that Scripture, with the Oration before-mentioned,you cannot keep silent those things, which the Tongue and Understand suggest, andadminister to thee."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"11The Oration which follows, is a certain Invocation of the Angels of God, and itprovoketh Eloquence, and ought to be said in the beginning of the Scripture, and inthe beginning of the Moneth.The Oration.Lameth, Leynach, Semach, Belmay, (these Orations have not proper Lunations, as theCommentator saith upon the Gloss.)

If you doubt of the Virginity of anyone, say this Oration inyour mind, and it shall be revealed to you whether she be a Virgin or Corrupt.Here follows an efficacious Preface of an Oration, shewing what Vertue and Efficacy you may thereby prove every day.Of this Oration Solomon saith, That by it a new knowledge of Physick is to berevealed from God: Upon which, he hath laid this command, and calleth it, TheMiraculous and Efficacious Foundation of the Physical Science; and that it con-taineth in it the quantity and quality of the whole Physical Art and Science: whereinthere is contained, rather a miraculous and specious, then fearful or terrible Miracle,which as often-soever as thou readest the same, regard not the paucity of words, butpraise the Vertue of so great a Mystery: For, Solomon himself speaking of the subtiltyof the Notory Art, wonderfully extolls the Divine Help; to wit, Because we have pro-posed a great thing, that is to say, so many and so great Mysteries of Nature, con-tained under so specious brevity, that I suppose them to be as a general Problem to beproposed in the ordination of so subtle and excellent a work; that the mind of theReader or Hearer may be the more confirmed and fixed here-upon.Here he sheweth how every Note of every Art ought to exercise his own office; and that the Notes of one Art profit not to the knowledge of another Art, and we are to know, that all Figures have their proper Orations.We come now, according to our strength, to divide the families of the Notory Art,and leaving that part which is natural, we come to the greater parts of the Art: forSolomon, a great composer, and the greatest Master of the Notory Art, comprehen-deth divers Arts under the Notion thereof. Therefore he calleth this a Notory Art,because it should be the Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences; which comprehendethin itself all Arts and Sciences, Liberal and Mechanick: And those things which inother Arts are full of long and tedious locutions, filling up great prolixious Volumesof Books, wearying out the Student, through the length of time to attain them: Inthis Art are comprehended very briefly in a few words or writings, so that it discov-ereth those things which are hard and difficult making the ingenious learned in avery short time, by the wonderful and unheard-of Vertue of the words. Therefore we, to whom such a faculty of the knowledge of the Scripture of Sci-ences is granted, have wholly received this great gift, and inestimable benefit, fromthe overflowing grace of the most high Creator.

The same Oration is also to be said, when you would clearly andplainly understand and expound any Science or great Mystery, that is on a suddenproposed to you, which you never heard of before: say also the same Oration at suchtime, when any thing of great consequence is importuned of you, which at presentyou have not the faculty of expounding.

There isan example of this Oration in the Book called, The Flower of Heavenly Learning: forherein Solomon glorifieth God, because by this he inspired into him the knowledge ofTheologie, and dignified him with the Divine Mysteries of his Omnipotent Powerand Greatness: which Solomon beholding in his night-sacrifice, bestowed upon himby the Lord his God, he conveniently gathered the greater Mysteries together in thisNotory Art, which were holy, and worthy, and reverend Mysteries. These things andMysteries of Theologie the erring Gentiles have not all lost, which Solomon calleth,The Signe of the holy Mystery of God revealed by his Angel before; and that whichis contained in them, is the fullness of our dignity and humane Salvation.The first of these Orations which we call Spiritual, the virtue where of teacheth Divinity, and preserveth the memory thereof.These are Orations also, which are of great vertue and efficacy to our Salvation: Thefirst whereof is Spiritual, and teacheth Divinity; and also Perseverance in the Mem-ory thereof: Therefore Solomon commandeth it to be called, The Signe of the Graceof God; for, as Ecclesiastes saith, This is the Spiritual Grace of God, that hath given meknowledge to treat of all Plants, from the Cedar of Lebanon, to the Hyssop that groweth onthe wall.The Election of time, in what Lunation these Orations ought to be said.The first Oration ought to be said once in the first Lunation; in the third, threetimes; in the sixth, six times; in the ninth, nine times; in the twelfth, twelve times; inthe seventeenth, seventeen times; and in the eighteenth, as many times; in the twentysixth, as many; in the twenty ninth, as many; and so many in the thirty ninth: for thisOration is of so great vertue and efficacy, that in the very day thou shalt say the same,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16as if it were determined by the Father, it shall increase thy knowledge in the Scienceof Divinity.But if otherwise that thou art ignorant, and it hath been seen by thy Compan-ions, thy Superiors or Inferiors, though unto others thou shalt seem to have knowl-edge; enter into the study of Divinity, and hear the Le\u0001ures by the space of somemonths, casting off all doubt from thee, of them who shall see thee, to know suchthings: and in that day wherein thou wouldst say it, live chastly, and say it in themorning.Solomon testifieth, That an Angel delivered the following Oration in Thunder,who standeth always in the Presence of the Lord, to whom he is not dreadful. TheMystery hereof is holy, and of great efficacy: neither ought this Oration to be saidabove once, because it moveth the heavenly Spirits to perform any great work.Of this Oration he saith, That so great is the Mystery thereof, that it moveththe Coelestial Spirits to perform any work which the Divine Power permitteth. Italso giveth the vertue of its Mystery, that it exalteth the tongue and body of him thatspeaketh it, with so great inspiration, as is some new and great Mystery were sud-denly revealed to his understanding.Here followeth the beginning of this Oration, wherein is so great Virtue and efficacy, as we have said, it being said with great devotion.Achacham, Yhel, Chelychem, Agzyraztor, Yegor, &c.This is the beginning of the Oration, the parts whereof are four: But there issomething to be said of the beginning by itself, and the four parts severally; and thenbetween the beginning and these Orations, which are four, we shall make this com-petent division.For this is that which is to be spoken of the beginning severally: And this Ora-tion is to be divided into four parts; and the first part thereof is to be said, that is, thebeginning, before any other part of the Oration is to be completed. These GreekNames following are to be pronounced. This is the division of these Orations,Heilma, Helma, Hmena, &c. Oh God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit,Confirm this Oration, and my Understanding and Memory, to receive, understand,and retain the knowledge of all good Scriptures; and give me perseverance of mindetherein.This is the beginning of that Oration, which, as we have said before, ought tobe said according to the Prolations and Constitutions thereof; and ought to berepeated, because of the forgetfulness of our Memory, and according to the exerciseof our wit, and according to the san\u0001ity of our life; there being contained in it sogreat a Mystery, and such efficacious Vertue.There followeth another subtle Oration, wherein is contained a SacramentalMystery, and wherein every perfe\u0001 Science is wonderfully compleated: For herebyGod would have us to know, what things are Celestial, and what are Terrene; andwhat heavenly things the Celestial effe\u0001eth, and what earthly things the Terrene:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"17because the Lord hath said, My eyes have seen the imperfe\u0001, and in thy book everyday shall be formed and written, and no Man in them, &c. So it is in the Precepts ofGod: for we are not able to write all things, how the Sun hath the same course as atfirst, that our order may be confirmed; for all writings whatsover, which is not fromGod, is not to be read; for God himself would have all things to be divided: and thisis how these are to be used, before the second part, which containeth so glorious andexcellent Consecrations of Orations, and defineth the Consecrated part to have nopower in the Heavens, and in no wise can be defined by humane Tongues.This is the beginning of the second part of that Oration spoken of before, which is of great virtue.Aglaros, Theomiros, Thomitos, &c.This is the second part of the precedent Oration, of which some singular thingis to bespoken. Whereof if thou sayest this Oration, commemorating the first partthereof, say the Oration following, and thou shalt perceive the precepts which aretherein.Oh God of all things, who art my God, who in the beginning hast created all thingsout of nothing, and hast reformed all things by the Holy Spirit; complete and restore myconscience, and heal my understanding, that I may glorify thee in all my works, thoughtsand words. And after thou hast said this Oration, make a little respite the space of half an hour, and then say the third part of the Oration, which follows: Megal, Legal, Chariotos, &c.Having said this third part of the Oration, then meditate with thy self about the Scriptures thou desirest to know; and then say this Oration.Oh thou that art the Truth, Light, and Way, of all Creatures; Oh Just God, viv-ify me, and confirm my understanding, and restore my knowledge and conscienceunto me, as thou didst unto King Solomon, Amen.Commemorating the parts according to that which is laid down, add the Ora-tion following: the other Orations being said, say the fourth part of the Oration,which is this, Amasiel, Danyihayr, &c. Then the parts being commemorated as is directed, add also the following Oration.I speak these things in thy presence, Oh Lord my God, before whose face all thingsare naked and open, that I, being washed from the error of infidelity, thy all-quickingSpirit may assist me, and take away all incredulity from me."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18How the Latine Orations are not expounded by the words of the Orations.We are therefore to know, that the whole Oration remaineth unexpounded; becausethe words thereof are of so great subtilty, adorned with the Hebrew and ChaldeanTongue, with the subtile and wonderful Elocution of God: that the Office of the freeExposition thereof, cannot possibly be transferred upon me. The Latine words whichare subjoyned to the parts of the Oration aforesaid, are such words as have beentranslated out of the Chaldean Tongue: for they are not the whole Oration; but ascertain Heads of every Oration pertaining thereunto.Here he speaketh of the efficacy of all these.For this Oration is such a Mystery, as King Solomon himself witnesseth, that a Ser-vant of his house having found this book by chance, and being too much overcomewith Wine in the company of a Woman, he presumtuously read it; but before he hadfinished a part thereof, he was stricked dumb, blind and lame, and his Memory takenfrom him; so he continued to the day of his death: and in the hour of his death, hespoke and said, that four Angels which he had offended in presumtuous reading sosacred a mystery, were the daily keepers and affli\u0001ers, one of his Memory, another ofhis speech, a third of his sight, and the fourth of his hearing.By which Testimony this Oration is so much commended by the same KingSolomon, and great is the Mystery thereof: we do greatly require and charge everyone, that will say or read it, that he do it not presumptuously; for in presumption issin; Wherefore let this Oration be said, according as is dire\u0001ed.We therefore hold it convenient and necessary, to speak something of the gen-eral precepts of art, and of the knowledge of all arts; and of the several precepts ofevery singular art: but because we have touched something of the course of theMoon, it is necessary that we shew what her course signifies. The Moon passeththrough 12 Signs in one Moneth; and the Sun through 12 Signs in a year; and in thesame term and time, the Spirit inspireth, fru\u0001ifieth and illustrateth them; whence itis said, that the Sun and the Moon run their course: it is understood the coursewhich first they had. But because this is wanting in the Hebrew, we thought good toomit it in the Latine, having spoken sufficiently of the preceding Oration, and thethree parts thereof.In this Chapter he sheweth the efficacy of the subsequent Oration,it being special to obtain Eloquence.This Holy Oration which followeth, is a certain special Oration, to obtain Elo-quence; whereas all others have virtue and efficacy in other things, this containeththis certain special mystery in it self: and whereas one of the generals is shewing in itself, certain general precepts, common to all arts; for so God instituted the Soul inthe Body, saying; This I give to you, that ye may keep and observe the Law of theLord; And these are they that stand in the presence of God alwayes, and see theirSavior face to face night and day: So of this Oration, I say, This is that most glorious,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"19mystical and intelligible Oration, containing such mysteries in it, which the mind,conscience and tongue succeedeth. This is such a mystery, that a man shall keep itaccording to his will, who foreseeth all things in his sight that are made; for the mys-tery of this Oration is glorious and Sacramental: let no man presume to say any ofthis Oration after too much drinking or Luxury; nor fasting, without great reverenceand discretion. Whence Solomon saith; Let no man presume to treat anything of thisOration, but in certain determinate and appointed times, unless he make mention ofthis Oration before some great President, for some weighty business; for which thisOration is of wonderful excellent virtue.The goodness of this Oration, and the attaining to the effe\u0001s thereof, it is readin that Psalm wherein it is said, Follow me, and I will make you Fishers of Men, ashe said and did.We know that it is not of our power, that this Oration is of so great Virtue, andsuch a mystery as sometimes also the Lord said to his Disciples, This we are not ableto know: for this Oration is such a mystery, that it containeth in it the great Name ofGod; which many have lied in saying they knew it; for Jesus himself performed manyMiracles in the Temple by it: But many have lyed about what he did, and have hidand abandoned the truth thereof; so that none have declared the same before it cameto passe: but we suppose have spoken something about or concerning it.In this Chapter he setteth down the time and manner how this Oration is to be pronounced.For this Oration is one of the generals, and the first of particulars, containing both init self; having a special virtue and faculty, to gain Eloquence in it self: therefore it isnecessary to be understood what time, ordination, and what dayes it is to be said andpublished.It may always be rehearsed in every 14 Lunary as above said; but the ordinationof the time for every day, wherein it is to be said, is especially in the morning betimes,before a man is defiled; and then all Orations are chiefly to be said. And this Orationmust be then pronounced totally together, without any division. And although thereare divisions therein, the Oration is not divided in itself; but only the Divine andGlorious Names are written severally, and are divided into parts, according to the ter-minations of every great and Glorious name; and it is to be said together as a mostexcellent name, but not as one Word, because of the fragility of our nature; Neither isit needful to know the Elements of syllables, posited in this Oration; they are not tobe known; neither let anyone presumptuously speak them; neither let him do anything by way of temptation, concerning this Oration, which ought not to be done:Elmot, Sehel, Hemech, Zaba, &c.No Man that is impedited or corrupted with any crime ought to presume to say this Oration.This is a thing agreed unto amongst the wise men of this World, that these things, aswe have said before, be pronounced with great reverence and industry: it may be said"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20every day, wherein thou art not hindered by some criminal sin; and in that daywherein thou art impedited by some criminal sin, thou maist remember it in thyheart; and if thou dost desire to be made Eloquent, repeat it three times.

I beseech thee, Oh my God, to grant me the inestima-ble Wisdom of the Life of thy holy Angels. Oh God the Holy Spirit, incomprehen-sible, in whose presence stand the Holy quires of Angels; I pray and beseech thee, bythy Holy and Glorious Name, and by the sight of thy Angels, and the HeavenlyPrincipalities, to give thy grace unto me, to be present with me, and to give unto mepower to persevere in the Memory of thy Wisdom, who livest and reignest eternallyone eternal God, through all worlds of worlds; in whose sight are all Celestial Vir-tues, now and alwayes, and everywhere, Amen.This Oration being thus finished, there must of necessity some Mystery beadded; so that you are to be silent a while after the Latine Oration is ended: and aftera little taciturnity, that is, a little space of silence, begin to say this Oration followingseriously: Semet, Lamen, &c.This (saith Solomon) is the Oration of Orations, and a special experiment,whereby all things, whether generals or particulars, are known fully, efficaciously andperfe\u0001ly, and are kept in the Memory. But when thou hast by this Oration attainedthe Eloquence thou desirest, be sparing thereof, and do not rashly declare thosethings which thy Tongue suggests and administers to thee; for this is the end of allgeneral Precepts, which are given to obtain Memory, Eloquence, and understanding,All those things which are before delivered, of general precepts, are given as signshow the faculty of attaining to the understanding of the general precepts may be had,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"21which also Solomon calleth Spirituals; and those singular arts have singular virtuesand powers.Having now given a sufficient definition of general precepts; and the Orationsare laid down, and the Authority of the Orations unto what they are designed; It isnow necessary to set down what is to be done, concerning the singular Orations;because we are now to treat of the several and particular arts, that we may follow theexample which our builder and Master hath laid before us; for Solomon saith, beforewe proceed to the singular Notes and Orations of Arts before noted, there ought tobe said a Preludium, which is a beginning or Prologue.How every several Art hath its proper note.1Before we proceed to the singular precepts of several Arts, it is necessary to discoverhow every several Art hath a several Note.Of the Liberal Sciences and other things, which may be had by that Art.The Liberal Arts are seaven, and seaven exceptives, and seaven Mechanicks. Theseaven exceptives are comprehended under the seaven liberal: It is manifest what theseaven Liberal Arts are, of which we shall first treat. The Mechanicks are these,which are adulterately called Hydromancy, Pyromancy, Nigromancy, Chiromancy, Geo-mancy, Geonegia, which is comprehended under Astronomy and Neogia.Hydromancy is a science of divining by the Water; whereby the Masters thereofjudged by the standing or running of the Water. Pyromancy is an Experiment ofdivining by the flaming of the fire; which the ancient Philosophers esteemed of greatefficacy. Nigromancy is a Sacrifice of dead Animals, whereby the Ancients supposedto know many great Experiments without sin, and to attain to great knowledge: fromwhence Solomon commandeth that they might read seaven Books of that Art withoutsin; And that two he accompted Sacriledge, and that they could not read two Booksof that Art without sin. But having spoken enough hereof, we proceed to the rest.Of the Liberal Sciences and other things which may be had thereby.There are seaven Liberal Arts, which everyone may learn without sin. For Philoso-phy is great, containing profound Mysteries in itself: These Arts are wonderfullyknown.He declareth what Notes the three first Liberal Arts have.For Grammar hath three Notes only, Dialects two, and Rhetorick four, and every onewith open and distin\u0001 Orations. But wherefore Grammar hath three, Dialects two,and Rhetorick four; that we know King Solomon himself testifieth and affirmeth; forhe saith, And as I was admiring and revolving in my heart and mind, which way,from whom and from whence was this Science, an Angel brought one Book, wherein1. This section begins part II of the manuscript, concerned with the acquisition of the skills pertaining to the specific Liberal Arts."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22was written the Figures and Orations, and delivered unto me the Notes and Orationsof all Arts, plainly and openly, and told me of them all as much as was necessary:And he explained unto me, as to a Child are taught by certain Elements; sometedious Arts in a great space of time, how that I should have these Arts in a shortspace of time: Saying unto me, So shalt thou be promoted to every science by theincrease of these Virtues. And when I asked him, Lord, whence and how comeththis? The Angel answered, This is a great Sacrament of the Lord, and of his Will:this writing is by the power of the Holy Ghost, which inspireth, fru\u0001ifieth andincreaseth all knowledge; And again the Angel said, Look Upon these Notes andOrations, at the appointed and determinate times, and observe the times asappointed of God, and no otherwise. When he had thus said he shewed to KingSolomon a Book wherein was written, at what times all these always were to be pro-nounced and published, and plainly demonstrated it according to the Vision of God:Which things I have heard and seen, did operate in them all, according to the Wordof the Lord by the Angel: And so Solomon declareth, it came to pass unto him: Butwe that come after him, ought to imitate his Authority, as much as we are able toobserve those things he hath left unto us.Here Solomon sheweth how the Angel told him distinctly, wherefore the Grammar hath three Figures.Behold wherefore the Grammatical Art hath only three Notes in the Book ofSolomon; Gemeliath, that is, in the Book of the Art of God, which we read is the Artof all other Sciences, and of all other Arts; For Solomon saith, When did I inquireeverything singularly of the Angel of God, with fear, saying, Lord, from whence shallthis come to passe to me, that I may fully and perfe\u0001ly know this Art? Why do somany Notes appertain to such an Art, and so many to such an Art, and are ascribedto several determinate Orations, to have the efficacy thereof? The Angel is thus saidto answer: The Grammatical Art is called a liberal Art, and hath three things neces-sary thereunto; Ordination of words and times; and in them, of Adjun\u0001s or Figures;Simple, compound and various; and a various declination of the parts to the parts, ora relation from the parts, and a Congruent and ordinate division. This is the reason,why there is three Notes in the Art of Grammar: And so it pleased the Divine Wis-dom, that as there should be a full knowledge of declining by one; by another, thatthere should be had a convenient Ordination of all the parts; by the third, thereshould be had a continual and convenient Division of all the parts, simple and com-pound.The Reason why the Dialectical Art hath two Figures onely.Dialect, which is called the form of Arts, and a Do\u0001rinal speech, hath two thingsnecessary thereunto, to wit, Eloquence of Arguing, and Prudence to answer; There-fore the greatness of the Divine Providence and Piety, hath appointed two Notes toit; that by the first, we may have Eloquence to Argue and Dispute; and by the sec-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"23ond, industry to answer without ambiguity: Wherefore there are ascribed to Gram-mar three Notes, and to Dialect two Notes.The Reason why Rhetorick hath four Figures.Let us see wherefore Rhetorick hath four Notes. For there are four things necessarytherein; as the Angel of the Lord said unto Solomon; to wit, a continual and flourish-ing adornment of locution, An ordinate, competent and discreet judgement, a Testi-mony of Causes or Offices, of Chances & Losses, a composed disposition of buyingand selling; An Eloquence of the matters of that Art, with a demonstrative under-standing. Therefore the greatness of God hath appointed to the Art of Rhetorick fourNotes, with their Holy and Glorious Orations; as they were reverently sent by theHand of God; that every Note in that Art aforesaid, might have a several faculty,That the first Note in that Art, might give a continual locution, a competent and flo-rishing adornment thereof: The second, to discern Judgements, just and unjust, ordi-nate and inordinate, true and false: The third, competently to discover offices andcauses: and the fourth giveth understanding and Eloquence in all the operations inthis Art, without prolixity. See therefore how in Grammar, Logick, and Rhetorick,the several Notes are disposed in the several Arts.But of all the other Arts and their Notes, we shall speak in their due place andtime, as we find them disposed in the book of the same Solomon.At what times and hours the Notes of these three Liberal Arts are to be looked into.Now we proceed to shew at what time, and how the Notes of these Arts are to belooked into, and the Orations to be said, to attain to these Arts. If thou art altogetherignorant of the Grammatical Art, and wouldst have the knowledge thereof: if it beappointed thee of God to do this work of works, and have a firm understanding inthis Art of Arts; then know that thou maist not presume to do otherwise than thisbook commandeth thee; for this book of his shall be thy Master, And this Art of histhy Mistress.How the Grammatical Notes are to be looked into in the first Moon.For in this manner, the Grammatical Notes are to be looked into, and the Orationsto be said.In the dayes when the Moon is in her prime, the first Note is to be looked into12 times, and the Oration thereof repeated 24 times with Holy reverence; making alittle space between, let the Oration be twice repeated at the inspe\u0001ion of everyNote, and chiefly abstain from sins: do this from the first day of the Moon to the 14,and from the 14 to the 17. The first and second Notes are to be looked into 20 times,and the Oration to be repeated 30 times, on the 15 and 17 dayes, using some intervalbetween them, All the three Notes are then everyday to be looked into 12 times, andthe Orations are to be repeated 20 times: and thus of the Notes of the Art of Gram-mar.

This is the Grammatical precept.Of the Logical Notes.The Diale\u0001ical Notes may be used every day, except only in those dayes before toldof: The Rhetorical every day, except only three dayes of the Moneth, to wit, \u0004. 11. 17.and 19. And they are forbidden on these dayes, as Solomon testifies, the Notes of allArts, except the Notes of this Art are offered. These precepts are generally to beobserved.How the Logical Notes are to be inspected, and the Orations thereof said.Know, that the Diale\u0001ical Notes are four times to be looked into, and the Orationsthereof in that day are 20 times to be repeated, making some respite, and having thebooks of that Art before your Eyes; and so likewise the books of Rhetorick, when theNotes thereof are inspe\u0001ed, as is appointed. This sufficeth for the knowledge of the 3Arts.How we must beware of offences.Before we proceed to begin the first Note of the Art of Grammar, something is to betryed before, that we may have the knowledge of the 1, 2 and 3 Notes. And you oughtfirst to know, in what the Notes of the Grammatical, Logical, or Rhetorical Art areto be inspe\u0001ed, it being necessary that your greatest intentions be to keep from alloffences.How the Notes ought to be inspected, at certain elected times.This is a special and manifest knowledge, wherewith the Notes of the GrammaticalArt are known: how they are to be published, at what times, and with what distin-\u0001ion, is duly and competently manifest; it is spoken already of the publishing andinspe\u0001ion of the Notes and Orations: now we shall digress a little to speak some-thing of the times, it being in part done already.How diverse Months are to be sought out in the inspection of the Notes.We have spoken already of the tearms of this Art, wherein the Orations are to beread, and the Notes to be looked into: it remaineth to declare how the Lunations of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"25these Orations are to be inspe\u0001ed and found out. But see that you mistake not: yet Ihave already noted the Lunations, wherein the Notes ought to be looked into, andthe Orations rehearsed: But there are some Months, wherein the Lunation is moreprofitable than others: if thou wouldst operate in Theology or Astronomy, do it in afiery sign; if Grammar or Logick, in \u0005 or \u0006: if Musick or Physick, in \u0007 or \u0003; ifRhetorick, Philosophy, Arithmetick or Geometry, in \u0005 or \b: for Mathematicks, in\u0007 or \u0005: so they are well placed, and free from evil; for all Heavenly Potestates andChorus of Angels, do rejoyce in their Lunations, and determinate dayes.Here is made mention of the Notes of all Arts.I, Apollonius, following the power of Solomon, having disposed my self to keep hisworks and observations, as it is spoken in the three Notes of Grammar, so will Iobserve the times as they are to be observed: But the Orations thereof are not writ-ten, but are more fully demonstrated in the following work; for what is written ofthose three Notes, are not Orations, but Definitions of those Notes, written by theGreek, Hebrew, and Chaldean, and other things which are apprehended by us: Forthose writings which are not understood in Latine ought not to be pronounced, buton those dayes which are appointed by King Solomon, and in those dayes wherein theNotes are inspe\u0001ed, but on those dayes those Holy writings are always to berepeated: and the Latine, on those dayes wherein the Notes are not inspe\u0001ed. TheNotes of the Logical Art are two: and at what times they are to be published isalready shewn in part: more shall hereafter be said of them: now we come first to therest. The Latine writings may be published, according to the Antiquity of theHebrews, except on those dayes we have spoken of: for Solomon saith, See that thouperform all those precepts as they are given: But of the rest that follow, it is to bedone otherwise: for when thou seest the first Note of Logick, repeat in thy heart thesign in the first Note, and so in the Notes of all Arts, except those whereof a defini-tion shall be given.Definitions of several Arts, and the Notes thereof.We will give also Definitions of several Arts, as it is in the Book of Solomon; Geome-try hath one Note, Arithmetick a Note and a half; Philosophy, with the Arts and Sci-ences contained therein, hath 7 Species; Theology and Astronomy, with the Sciencesin them contained, hath 7 Notes, but they are great and dangerous; not great in thepronunciation, but have great efficacy: Musick hath one Note, and Physick oneNote; but they are all to be published and rehearsed in their appointed dayes: Butknow, that in every day wherein you beholdest the Notes of Theology, Philosophy, orof any Arts contained in them, that thou neither laugh nor play, nor sport; becauseKing Solomon, when he saw the forms of these Notes, having overdrunk himself,God was angry with him, and spoke unto him by his Angel, saying, Because thouhast despised my sacrament, and Polluted and derided my Holy things; I will takeaway part of thy Kingdome, and I will shorten the dayes of thy Children.

And when the Angel of the Lordappeareth to thee, keep and conceal the words and writings he revealeth to thee; andobserve them to pra\u0001ice and operate in them, observing all things with great rever-ence, and pronounce them at the appointed dayes and hours, as before is dire\u0001ed;and afterwards say; Sapienter die illo; Age, & caste vivas. But if thou dost anythinguncertain, there is danger; as thou wilt have experience from the other Notes andOrations of them, but consider that which is most wonderful in those Orations; forthese words are ineffable Names, and are spiritually to be pronounced before theineffable Note, Hosel, Jesel, Anchiator, Aratol, Hasiatol, Gemor, Gesameor. Those are theOrations which ought to be pronounced after the inspe\u0001ion of all the Arts, and afterthe Note of Theology."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"33This is the fulfilling of the whole work; but what is necessary for an experimentof the work, we will more plainly declare. In the beginning of the knowledge of allArts there is given almost the perfe\u0001 Do\u0001rine of operating: I say almost, becausesome flourishing institutions hereof remain, whereof this is the first beginning.How the Precepts are to be observed in the operation of all Arts.Observe the 4 \u0004 in every operation of Theology. Exhibit that operation with effi-cacy every 4 \u0004 quartram lunam; and diligently look into the books and writings ofthose Arts; if thou doubt of any of the Chapters, they are to be pronounced, as istaught of the superior Chapters; but know this, that these Holy Words of Orations,we appoint to be said before the bed of the sick, for an experiment of life or death.And this thou maist do often, if thou wil to perate nothing else in the whole body ofArt: And know this; that if thou hast not the books in thy hands, or the faculty oflooking into them is not given to thee; the effe\u0001 of this work will not be the lessetherefore: but the Orations are twice then to be pronounced, where they were to bebut once: And as to the knowledge of a vision, and the other virtues which theseHoly Orations have; thou maist prove and try them, when and how thou wilt.These Precepts are specially to be observed.But when thou would'st operate in Theology, observe only those dayes which areappointed; but all times are convenient for those Notes and Orations, for which thereis a competent time given; but in the pronounciation of the three liberal Arts, or inthe inspe\u0001ion of their Notes, perhaps thou maist pretermit some day appointed, ifthou observe the rest; or if thou transgress two dayes, leave not off the work, for itloseth not its effe\u0001 for this, for the Moon is more to be observed in the greater num-bers than the dayes or hours. For Solomon saith, If thou miss a day or two, fear not,but operate on the general Chapters. This is enough to say of them: but by no meansforget any of the words which are to be said in the beginning of the reading to attainto Arts; for there is great virtue in them. And thou maist frequently use the HolyWords of the visions: but if thou wouldst operate in the whole body of the PhysicalArt, the first Chapters are first to be repeated as before are defined. And in Theology,thou must operate only by thy self: Often repeat the Orations, and look into theNotes of Theology: this produceth great effe\u0001s. It is necessary that thou have theNote of the 24 Angels always in Memory; and faithfully keep those things, which theAngel reveales to thee in the vision.The Experiment of the precedent work, is the beginning of the following Orations, which Solomon calleth Artem Novam.1These Orations may be said before all Arts generally, and before Notes specially; andthey may be pronounced without any other Chapters, if thou wouldst operate in any1.
