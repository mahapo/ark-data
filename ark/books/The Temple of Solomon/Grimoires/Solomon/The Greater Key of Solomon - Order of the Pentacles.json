The First Pentacle of Saturn. – This Pentacle is of great value andutility for striking terror into the Spirits. Wherefore, upon its being shown to themthey submit, and kneeling upon the earth before it, they obey.Editor’s Note.– The Hebrew Letters within the square are the four great Names ofGod which are written with four letters:– YHVH, Yod, He, Vau, He; ADNI, Adonai;IIAI, Yiai (this Name has the same Numerical value in Hebrew as the Name EL); andAHIH, Eheieh.

It will beseen at a glance that it is a square of five, giving twenty-five letters, which, added tothe unity, gives twenty-Six, the numerical value of IHVH. The Hebrew versicle sur-rounding it is taken from Psalm lxxii 8, \"His dominion shall be also from the one seato the other, and from the flood unto the world’s end.

It servethfor assured visions. Jacob being armed with this Pentacle beheld the ladder whichreached unto heaven.Editor’s Note.– The Hebrew letters within the Pentacle are taken from the five lastwords of the versicle which surrounds it, each of which contains five letters. Theseare, then, recombined so as to form certain Mystical Names. The versicle is takenfrom Ezekiel i. 1:– \"As I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, the heavenswere opened, and I saw visions of Elohim.\" In my opinion the versicle should onlyconsist of the five last words thereof, when the anachronism of Jacob using a Pentaclewith a sentence from Ezekiel will not longer exist.Figure 23.

Around it is the sentence, John i. 4:– \"In Him was life, and thelife was the light of man.\" This may be adduced as an argument of the greater antiq-uity of the first few mystical verses of the Gospel of St. John.Figure 27. The Third Pentacle of Mars. – It is of great value for exciting war,wrath, discord, and hostility; also for resisting enemies, and striking terror into rebel-lious Spirits; the Names of God the All Powerful are therein expressly marked.Editor’s Note.– The Letters of the Names Eloah and Shaddai.

On either side is the Name \"El Shaddai.\" Around iswritten in Latin:– \"Behold His face and form by Whom all things were made, andWhom all creatures obey.\"Figure 33.
