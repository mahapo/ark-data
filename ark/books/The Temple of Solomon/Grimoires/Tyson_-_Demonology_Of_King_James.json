When his mother was forced to abdicate her throne by Queen Elizabeth, James was proclaimed King James the Sixth of Scotland on July 24, 1567. For the first twelve years of his life he was not permitted to participate in state affairs, but was kept for his own security in Sterling Castle, safe from the constantly bickering Scottish factions. Physically he was weak and sickly, a misfortune of health that played a significant part in his tendency in later life to achieve his purposes by manipulation and deceit rather than the bold exercise of power. For the first six or seven years of his life he was unable to stand up or walk without aid. As a young man he developed a love for horseback riding, but it was necessary that he be tied on to his horse due to the weakness in his legs, and once when he fell into a body of water while out riding he nearly drowned because he was unable to help himself. Throughout his life he preferred to walk leaning on the shoulder of an attendant. Weakness of body was in part compensated for by keenness of intellect. When Sir Henry Killigrew saw the boy in 1574 he was im­pressed by the skill of eight -year-old James in translating Latin and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION French texts. From an early age he was trained by his guardians in the Protestant faith, and developed an aversion for Catholicism, al­though this did not prevent him from sending a letter to the pope in 1584, hinting that he might be persuaded to change his faith if it for­warded his political goals. James was always ready to imply friend­ship and favor, provided there was no actual necessity of ever giving them. There seems little doubt that James was a coward . He fought against this tendency throughout his life, but it was his nature and he could never overcome it. In 1582 he was kidnapped by a faction of Scottish nobles during the Raid of Ruthven. Although he was then old enough to shave, he was so terrified of his captors that he cried like a child. Sir Thomas Lyon, one of the men keeping him hostage, gruffly told the young king it were better 'bairns [children] should greet [cry] than bearded men.\" James parted from his cap­tors in 1583 and began to rule his kingdom, but always remained timid. The Marquis de Fontenay, French ambassador to the Scottish court during the early part of his reign, spoke of James as cowed by the violence around him. When in 1587 his mother was executed by order of Elizabeth, he made little effort to prevent it. His personal appearance and manners were not attractive. He had a tendency to bluster and make promises he had no intention of ever fulfilling. He talked too much in a very thick Scottish ac­cent, and was pedantic and put on airs of scholarship that he did not merit. In dress he was slovenly and unclean. His physical caresses and frequent gifts to male favorites in his court gave rise to gossip that he was homosexual. All these tendencies were strongly despised by the English people when he ascended to the throne of England in 1603 at the death of Elizabeth, but they swallowed their distaste and welcomed him in a practical spirit, as the only alternative to bitter civil war. In 1589 James married Anne, second daughter of Frederick the Second, king of Denmark. This union between the Protestant mon-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 arch and the Protestant pri ncess grea tly alarmed the Catholic fac­tions in England and Scotland, who saw their hope for a restoration of the papacy slipping away. Until this marriage, James had done his best to maintain a cordial relationship with both the Vatican and the royal family of Spain, but this choice of a bride left no question about his religious leanings. Perhaps the only romantic and coura­geous action James ever took was to sail out to meet Anne after her ship was driven by storm into the port of Oslo in Norway. It was there that James enjoyed his first night of connubial bliss with his fifteen-year-old bride. The trials of the North Berwick witches (who received this title because they were supposed to congregate in the kirk, or church, at North Berwick near Edinburgh in the dead of night to meet with the Devil and concoct their plots) took place mainly between the years 1590 and 1592, although the fallout of the affair dragged on for years. It marked a major turning point in the thinking of the young king. The charges against the accused included numerous attempts by magic on his life, and even one effort to kill the queen while she was on her voyage from Denmark to England. Previously James had only faced plots by the rebellious Scottish nobles that endangered his life by physical means, but now he found himself and his new bride threat­ened by the supernatural. James keenly interested himself in the trials, and was a direct par­ticipant in much of the questioning. He mentioned in his Tolbooth speech of 1591 (see Appendix C) that the proceedings against the ac­cused witches occupied him for a full nine months, and it would not be excessive to say that he was the prime mover in the whole affair. Undoubtedly he observed the torture of the accused, and heard the confessions wrung from their own agonized mouths. He was grati­fied to learn from Agnes Sampson that the Devil considered him to be his chief opponent, and it was for this reason that Satan hated him and wished to bring about his death. She testified that when the witches asked Satan why he hated the king so much, the Devil"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 INTRODUCTION replied: \"By reason the king is the greatest enemie hee hath in the world.\" By this extraordinary statement the Devil cast James into the role of an avenging knight of the Christian fai th. James was fond of mak­ing reference to the warrior mounted upon a white horse (Revela­tion 19: 11-16) who is prophesied to descend to Earth to punish the wicked in the latter days, which James believed to already have ar­rived. As an intensely religious man, and as the leader of his nation in matters military, spiritual, and judicial, it would have been difficult for James to decline the role of Satan's chief adversary. He accepted i t as a challenge and spent the better part of the next four decades trying to do it honor. Since this mythic figure upon his white horse is so central to the view James held of his own crusade against witchcraft, it is worth quoting the relevant verses from the King James Bible version of the text: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righ­teousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself: And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Can there be any doubt that James saw in the brave knight on the white horse with \" many crowns\" a reflection of himself? Or that the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 sharp sword that proceeds from his mouth was for james the book Demonology and the 1604 Witchcraft Statute of England? He viewed himself as a general in the army of Christ, \"clothed in fine linen, white and clean. \" It must have struck James as significant, in light of this biblical passage, that the accused North Berwick witches sought to bring about his death by procuring a piece of linen that he had soiled, so as to use his bodily excretions in their magic against him. James was a strong believer in the supernatural and the power of magic, but he ascribed all working of magic to the Devil. He did not recognize what Cornelius Agrippa called \"natural magic,\" or what was sometimes termed \"white magic, \" as a lawful activity. The ef­ficacy of herbs and stones was either an inherent part of their com­position, and so a matter of medicine and science, or it was infused into them by the power of Satan in order to deceive those who used them for healing or other purposes. For James, there was no such thing as occult forces that could be used for benevolent purposes. On the one hand there was the power of God, which had ceased to produce prophecies or miracles since the time of Christ, and on the other hand there was the power of Satan, which waxed stronger in the modern age than at any other time in history due to the immi­nence of the end of the world, and was responsible for all marvelous effects that were other than natural. The supernatural must have terrified him at least as much as the political intimidations used by his Scottish nobles. In an effort to know his spiritual enemies as well as he knew his temporal foes, he made an extensive study of the available literature on the subjects of magic, witchcraft, and demons. It is tempting to assume that his reading was wider than it was deep. Summers wrote disparagingly about the degre e of learning he displayed in his treatise on witch­craft: \" In many passages King james has borrowed from the Conti­nental demonologists, whom he read with more diligence than acu­men. For all his zeal and dexterous learning one feels that there is something just a little superficial in his grasp of the more scholarly"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 INTRODUCTION writers and theologians\" (Summers, Geography of Wi tchcraft, page 224). In the king's defense, he had been present during the actual ques­tioning of the accused North Berwick witches, and had heard their testimony, so James' knowledge of the subject was not entirely the­oretical, as was the knowledge of his critic Summers. In any case, James was hardly about to instruct his readers in the finer points of practical necromancy and witchcraft, regardless of how much theoretical knowledge he might himself possess. The purpose of his book, which arose as a direct visceral reaction to the North Ber­wick trials and the supposed plots against his life by magic, was to increase the persecution of witches in Scotland and England. Every­thing in the work is tailored to achieve this end. Shortly after assuming the English throne in 1603, James ordered a new edition of his book published in London so that he could ex­tend his crusade against witchcraft into England. A Dutch transla­tion was published in 1604, and Latin editions came off the presses in Hanover in 1604 and 1607. A year after his coronation, James suc­ceeded in getting the 1563 witchcraft statute that had been enforced during most of the long reign of Elizabeth abolished, and a new statute erected in its place that contains harsher and broader punish­ments for witches and practitioners of magic. So keen was James on this matter that his reinterpretation of the witchcraft laws went to the House of Lords for consideration only eight days after the first sitting of parliament of his reign as the English king, and passed on first reading. The main difference between the law of Elizabeth and that of James concerned what should be the focus of the punishment. Under Elizabeth, those who practiced witchcraft and sorcery were subject to the most severe punishment only if they were found to have used these arts to commit murder or other injuries. It was the crimes in which witchcraft had been employed that were the pri­mary object of punishment, not the practice of witchcraft itself,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 which was of secondary concern. James wanted the practice of any form of magic punished severely, regardless of whether it was used to commit injuries to others, because he held all such practice to be trafficking with the Devil, whom he believed to be the source of the efficacy for all magic. Under the law of Elizabeth, anyone who bewitched another without causing his death was subject to a penalty of one year in prison; the law of James made the same crime punishable by hang­ing. Minor infractions, such as using divination to locate stolen prop­erty, making love potions, or damaging property such as laming a cow or causing hail to flatten a crop in the field were still punishable by a year in prison and a term in the pillory, as they had been under the old law. James caused it to become a felony to invoke any evil spirit, or to have any dealings with an evil spirit. This meant that to keep a familiar spirit in the form of a cat, dog, rabbit, or other pet was punishable by death . The Devil was thought to mark those with whom he made a pact. To be found to have a witch mark anywhere on the body was also enough evidence of consultation with an evil spirit to be punishable by death, hence the vigorous questioning by the courts about familiars, and the intensity of the search for the witch mark. The statute of James made it a crime punishable by hanging to: 1) invoke, consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed, or re­ward any evil spirit for any purpose 2) take any dead body, or any part of a dead body, for use in any witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment 3) practice any form of witchcraft, enchantment, charm, or sor­cery in which any person is killed, destroyed, wasted, con­sumed, pined, or lamed in the body, or any part of the body 4) aid, abet, or counsel others in any of the above acts The statute also made it a crime punishable by one year in prison to use witchcraft, enchantment, charms, or sorcery to:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 INTRODUCTION 1) locate any treasure of gold or silver in the earth or other hid-ing places 2) locate any lost or stolen goods or things 3) intend to provoke any person to unlawful love 4) destroy, waste, or impair any chattel or goods of another person 5) attempt without success to hurt or destroy any person in the body All of the offences punishable by a year in prison on the first of­fence were felonies on the second commission, and punishable by hanging. On the matter of capital punishment for witchcraft, in England it was hanging, the same as for other more common felonies such as murder. In Scotland, witchcraft was punished by burning, but the custom was to strangle the condemned witch at the stake before lighting the fire, and in this way to lessen the suffering of the witch. This was done as an act of mercy when the witch confessed to her supposed crimes, and did not recant the confession once the torture used to extract the confession had been halted. If the witch retracted the confession, the mercy of strangulation might be withdrawn and she might be burned alive, though this barbarity was uncommon. In practice, the English courts carried on much as they had before the passage of the witch statute of James in meting out the death penalty. It was usually only given to those who had been convicted of causing the death of another person with witchcraft or necro­mancy. For example, even though it was a capital offence under the new law to dig up a corpse for use in magic, no one was ever put to death for this crime. There were exceptions. In 1645 seven women were hanged at Chelmsford for entertaining evil spirits, which is to say, for keeping familiars. What the law did accomplish was the more frequent and vigorous prosecution of accusations of witchcraft in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 England, and later in America. The Salem witch trials were carried out under the statute of James, which was not abolished until 1 736. During the early part of his reign as English monarch, James was as rabid in his prosecution of witchcraft as he had been while living in Scotland, but as the years passed, his fervor began to wane. He was able to prove to his satisfaction that several of those who had accused others of witchcraft had been lying. In 160 5 James paid three hundred pounds to the Reverend Sam­uel Harsnett to question a fourteen-year-old girl, Anne Gunter, who had accused three woman in Abingdon of witchcraft. The girl ad­mitted under the sharp questioning of Harsnett that she had only been pretending to fall into fits, and had falsely accused the women. While traveling north in 1618, James stopped at Leicester when six women were due to be hanged as witches on the evidence of a twelve-year-old boy, John Smith, who claimed that his convulsions were caused by their bewitchment of him. Nine other women had already been executed on the lad's testimony. James examined the boy and determined to his satisfaction that his fits we re nothing but fraud. The women were freed, and Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke, who had presided over their trial, was disgraced. In 1621 James questioned yet another youthful accuser, a girl of the town of Westham in Essex (now a part of greater London) named Katherine Malpas, who pretended to be subject to fits of de­monic possession, and accused two women of bewitching her. Since James had personally witnessed cases of possession, he was difficult to fool. A woman was made to confess that she had taught the girl to simulate the fits so that she could charge money of those who came to watch her convulsions. This and similar evidence of deception both enraged James and shook his confidence in his beliefs. It is asserted by some historians that James went so far in his later years as to completely repudiate the reality of witchcraft. Robbins quoted Thomas Fuller as assert­ing in his Church History of Britain that James \"grew first diffident"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"IO INTRODUCTION of, and then flatly to deny, the workings of witches and devils as but falsehoods and delusions\" (Robbins, Encyclopedia of Wi tchcraft and Demonology, page 279). This seems unlikely in view of the strength of these convictions, particularly since the intensity of his religious faith never wavered. Whether his own attitude changed or not, dur­ing his last nine years as king it is recorded that only five convicted witches were executed. Viewed as a whole, the prosecution of witches under his rule, though more vigorous than it had been during the reign of Eliza­beth, was not so severe as might appear from the tenor of his book and his statute. Montague Summers observed that there are only fifty cases of witches having been executed in England during the entire reign of King James. Summers wrote: \"It would appear that the popular ideas concerning the holocausts in the reign of James the I are anything but historically exact, and instead of shuddering at the large numbers who perished, we may well be surprised that the executions in England were so few\" (Geography of Wi tchcraft , page 132). Only fifty executions in England, yet many more women were tried, and even those who did not suffer imprisonment as a result of a guilty verdict had to face the humiliation of having their bod­ies shaved of all hair and a search made of their private parts for the witch mark, the censure and condemnation of their family, friends, and neighbors, and worst of all the protracted ordeal of torture used on them in an effort to extract a confession. It is probable that the number of executions would have been much higher had James been able to freely work his will during the early part of his reign, but his personal crusade against witchcraft was in part inhibited by the conservative nature of English common law, which is slow to change its way of doing things, and perhaps also by the common sense of many of the judges. One more incident must be related of James before we leave his life and proceed to a closer examinatio n of the North Berwick affair."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION II Margaret Murray related in God of the Witches that as James lay on his deathbed, an attempt was made in his bedchamber by his atten­dants to lessen his pain by transferring it into the body of an animal. A young pig was for this purpose dressed in the clothing of a human baby. One of the ladies of the court played the part of its mother, and the Duchess of Buckingham assumed the role of midwife. A gentleman who was dressed in the robes of a bishop read the ser­vice of baptism, while the Duke of Buckingham and other nobles played the part of the pig's godfathers. The pig was baptized, and then chased out of the room. It may be assumed that James was in a very bad state at that point, perhaps not even conscious of his surroundings. Yet if he did retain any of his mental faculties, what must he have thought of the performance of what was clearly a blasphemous ritual of witchcraft for his personal benefit? Was he inwardly horrified by what his con­cerned attendants were doing in their effort to lessen his suffering, or was he hypocritical enough to justify it in some way in his own mind, eve n though it was opposed to everything he had ever writ­ten or said concerning witchcraft? History has not recorded his last thoughts, only the incredible irony of the performance of a magic ritual over the deathbed of a man who all his life was steadfast in his loathing and rejection of anything remotely connected with the art of magic. THE NORTH BERWICK WITCHES The incidents that formed the basis for the North Berwick witch trials, which are partially detailed in the tract News From Scotland, may have been instigated, insofar as they have any factual basis, by the determination of James to wed Anne of Denmark. Among the charges against the witches is that they tried to sink the ship carrying James t o Denmark to meet with his future bride, and also the ship bringing Anne to England. Two of the items filed against john Fian, one of the supposed leaders of the plot, read as follows:"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 INTRODUCTION (7) ITEM, for the raising of winds at the King's passing to Denmark, and for the sending of a letter to Marian Linkup in Leith, to that effect, bidding her to meet him and the rest on the sea within five days; where Satan delivering a cat out of his hand to Robert Grierson, and gave the word to \"Cast the same in the sea, hola!\" And there after, being mounted in a ship and drunk like unto others, where Satan said, \" You shall sink the ship;\" like as they thought that did. (8) ITEM, for assembling himself with Satan, at the King's re­turning from Denmark, where Satan promised to raise a mist, and cast the King's Majesty in England: and for performing thereof, he took a thing like to a soot -ball, which appeared to the said John like a wisp, and cast the same in the sea; which caused a vapor and a reek to rise. A charge against Agnes Sampson accused her of sending a letter to another witch ordering her to \"warne the rest of the sisteris, to raise the wind this day, att eleavin houris, to stay the Quenis cuming in Scot­land.\" At the same time that women and men we re being accused in Scotland of trying to prevent the union of James and Anne, similar accusations were being made in Denmark. The spy of Lord Burghley in Copenhagen wrote to him in a letter dated July 23, 1590, that the admiral Peter Munk in Denmark \"hathe caused five or six witches to be taken in Coupnahaven, upon suspicion that by their witche craft they had staied the Queen of Scottes voiage into Scotland, and sought to have staied likewise the King's retorne. \" A woman named Anna Koldings was interrogated, and under the fear of greater tor­tures was compelled to give the names of five other women, one of them being the wife of the burgomaster of Copenhagen. Eventually all were induced to confess to raising a storm to sink Anne's ship, and of having sent demons to climb the keel of the vessel and pull it under the waves."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 It is a curious coincidence that the same storm that held back Queen Anne from initially sailing to Scotland also sank a ferry trav­eling between Burntisland and Leith with Lady Mary Melville of Garvock aboard. Burntisland is just west of Kinghorn on the oppo­site side of the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh. Lady Mary was the wife of Sir Andrew Melville, the master of the household affairs of King James, and was traveling to meet Anne upon her arrival in Scot­land. Concerning this tragedy of September, 1589, Sir James Melville wrote in his Memoirs, \"She, being willing to mak diligence, wald not stay for the storm, to sail the ferry; when the vehement storm drave a ship upon the said boat, and drownit the gentlewoman and all the persons except twa. \" Why this sudden furor to prevent the king from bringing his new bride back to Scotland? Margaret Murray, Montague Summers, and others have speculated that the purported attempts by the accused witches to kill James and Anne were motivated by the royal ambi­tions of Francis Stewart, the Earl of Bothwell. His title descended through his mother Jane Hepburn, who was the sister of the for­mer Earl of Bothwell that had married Mary, Queen of Scots, but his claim to the throne was from his father, Lord John Stewart, the illegitimate son of James the Fifth of Scotland. For so long as James remained without an heir, Bothwell could make a plausible claim for the Scottish crown at his death, but once James married and had children, that claim was void. There is some evidence to support this theory of Bothwell's involve ment with the North Berwick witches. In her confession, Agnes Sampson revealed that she had constructed a wax image of James, saying: \"This is Kingjames the sext, ordonit to be consumed at the instance of a noble man Francis Erie Bodowell.\" Murray and Summers both believed that Bothwell played the part of the Devil at the sabbat meetings of the witches, and it is true that in later years during his exile in Italy, Bothwell kept the reputation of being a pow­erful magician."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 INTRODUCTION This fanciful theory depends on a rather startling presupposi­tion-that prior to the exposure o f the plots of the witches, Both­well was the active head of a large coven of witches accustomed to meet at the North Berwick Kirk and elsewhere in the dead of night, where he dressed up in costume and played the part of Satan. If such nocturnal meetings took place, they must have been executed with a mastery of stealth and guile since this considerable undertaking of manpower and resources passed unnoticed in the small, closely knit communities near the church, where the members of the coven lived. James despised Bothwell for his pretensions to the succession. In a speech to the Scottish parliament in 1592 he denounced Bothwell and said of him that he was 'but a bastard and could claim no title to the crown\" (Margaret Murray, Wi tch-cult in We stern Europe, page 56). Murray pointed out that this was not accurate-Bothwell's father was a bastard, but Bothwell himself had been b orn o f a legal mar­riage; and in any case, Bothwell's father had been granted a letter of legitimacy by Mary, Queen of Scots. Though he felt contempt for this upstart, James was deathly afraid of him. When Bothwell came to Holyrood Castle in July of 1593 seeking a pardon from the king for the crimes he stood ac­cused of, he was admitted directly and without warning into the king's bedchamber by a lady of the court, where he caught James in the middle of dressing. The terrified James tried to run and hide in his wife's bedchamber, but the men who accompanied Bothwell blocked his path of escape and locked the door to prevent him from leaving before Bothwell had his say. James asked them their purpose: \"Came they to seek his life? Let them take it-they would not get his soul\" (Murray, Wi tch-cult in Western Europe, page 59). If James consid­ered Bothwell as the leader of the witches who conspired to bring about his death and a powerful necromancer in league with Satan against him, little wonder the sudden apparition of Bothwell in his bedchamber gave James a nasty turn."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION IS The whole business of the North Berwick witches started inno­cently enough with the uncanny healing abilities of a maidservant named Gilly Duncan. Although she had never been a healer before, she began to go to those who were sick or infirm to try to help them. Her neighbors took notice of this admirable charity when her efforts suddenly began to succeed with astonishing frequency. Rather than praise Duncan for her good works and count themselves fortunate to know her, they began to murmur behind her back that she must be accomplishing the miraculous cures with means that were other than natural. Duncan had the misfortune to work for David Seaton, the dep­uty-bailiff of the town. He decided to question his maid as to where she had acquired the skill to work such amazing cures, and why she was in the habit lately of stealing out of his house to sleep elsewhere every other night. It is impossible not to speculate about the per­sonal motives that prompted Seaton to question Duncan. Did he have some affection for her that was not returned, and did he take this excuse to ferret out information about his imagined rival? Or was Seaton upset with her because he thought her night wanderings were bringing scandal upon his household? Whatever his original suspicions, her stubborn silence enraged him. He had her held down and applied a set of thumbscrews to her fingers in an effort to compel her to speak. When she still did not answer to his satisfaction, he bound her head and wrung it with a rope, a popular form of torture in the sixteenth century. Duncan still refused to say what Seaton wanted her to say, so he decided to probe her for a witch mark, which was considered to be a sure sign of a witch. A witch mark is a small mole or other skin blemish insensi­tive to pain that is supposedly impressed on to the body of a witch at the time of her initiation into the craft by Satan himself. The way of locating it was to take a long, thick needle and thrust it deeply and successively into all moles, scars, or other marks on the skin, presumably with the unfortunate individual blindfolded, until one"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 INTRODUCTION was located that did not produce a shriek of pain. He found what he was looking for in the front of her throat, and this apparent evidence broke her will and induced her to confess that she was a witch, and that all her cures had been the work of Satan. Duncan was cast into prison, where she shortly began to name the names of her supposed accomplices in witchcraft. They were not all of low station in life. Agnes Sampson, the key figure among the women accused who was known locally as the Wise Wife of Nether-Keith, was a mature, educated woman said to be grave in her manner and settled in her answers to her inquisitors. Effie Mc­Calyan was the daughter of Lord Cliftonhall, and a woman of some social stature. John Fian was a schoolmaster. Barbara Napier was de­scribed as a woman of good family. These four appear to have been the leaders in the affair, or at least were nominated as its leaders by James and the magistrates, and were not in a position to decline the elevation. As more individuals were implicated and questioned, two threads emerged. One was the standard fantastic tale of malicious acts of magic worked at the behest of the Devil against ordinary townsfolk in the region around Edinburgh. The other was the plot to assas­sinate James and his wife. It is impossible to know how much truth is contained in either thread of the confessions. Although the inter­rogations of the accused have provided boundless matter for specu­lation, it will probably never be definitively proven either that there was any witchcraft going on or that there was ever a witch plot to kill James. Since the confessions were extracted under torture , or threat of torture , not a word of them can be trusted. It may be useful to gain some notion of how local was the affair of the North Berwick witches. Most of the communities involved were on the same side of the Firth of Forth as Edinburgh and were within walking distance of each other. The town of Tranent where the unfortunate Gilly Duncan was tortured by her master was about eight or nine miles from Edinburgh. Leith was only a mile or two"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION I7 away. Saltpans, where John Fian taught school, also sometimes called Saltpreston, was where Prestonpans is today, and some five or six miles from the city. The notorious North Berwick Kirk occupied a headland around twenty miles from Edinburgh . All these places are on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. Kinghorn and Burn­tisland, from where the ferryboat sailed that was supposed to have been sunk by the witches, with a loss of sixty lives, are both located opposite Leith across the Firth . The whole affair might be said to have occurred in the backyard of the king, which may be one reason he took so active an interest. The heart of the testimony concerned a sabbat meeting that took place in 1590 on Halloween at around midnight at the North Berwick Kirk. Here the witches, drunk and merry after riding down the Firth on their sieves and dancing on the green outside the church to the sound of a Jew's harp played by Gilly Duncan, entered the church to convene with the Devil, who stood in the pulpit dressed in a black hat and black gown, surrounded by burning black candles. In Melville's Memoirs he is described as terrible in appearance, with a nose like the beak of an eagle, great burning eyes, hairy hands and legs , with claws upon his hands and feet like those of a griffon. In a low voice the Devil called the roll, naming each witch by his or her witch name, with the exception of one named Robert Grier­son, who was quite annoyed when the Devil addressed him by his real name, since it had been agreed that they use only nicknames, his being \"Rob the Rower.\" The Devil asked the witches what evil they had worked in his name, and after hearing their deeds, they discussed their efforts to bewitch a wax image of Kingjames to bring about his death. The Devil instructed them to dig up four corpses, two outside the church in the graveyard and two that had been buried inside the building in vaults. From the corpses they removed the joints of the fi ngers, toes, and knees, and divided the parts up between them. The Devil told them to let the joints dry, then powder them and use the powder in works of evil magic. At one point during the evening they"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"I8 INTRODUCTION all kissed the Devil's bared buttocks as a homage to him. His skin was described as being cold and as hard as iron. The account of this Halloween meeting, contained in the some­what disordered confessions of the accused, has provided the pro­totype for countless subsequent descriptions of the witches' sabbat. Many of its elements are mentioned in earlier confessions of those accused of witchcraft in different European nations, but the North Berwick Kirk sabbat is perhaps the most complete and well-rounded of the descriptions. The judicial proceedings began in 1590 and extended for three years to the trial of the Earl of Bothwell in August 1593. There is some evidence that they dragged on even longer than this. In all some seventy persons were implicated. Margaret Murray wrote that thirty-nine persons were involved in the affair, a number she per­ceived as significant because it is three times thirteen, and thirteen is sometimes supposed to be the number of members in a witch coven. Murray also wrote that only four were ever tried (Witch-cult in We stern Europe, page 50). Neither of these numbers is accurate. There were various gradations of involvement. Not all those ac­cused were arrested, and not all those arrested were convicted. The exact numbers of persons arrested in the affair remain unknown, but the initial round of arrests took place in the months of Novem­ber and December in 1590, and the trials began in 1591. The execution of justice was capricious. A few of the accused fled to England, and the king instructed the same David Seaton who had started the whole affair to follow after them and recapture them. At least one woman was i dentified and imprisoned in Eng­land, causing james to go to great lengths to have her extradited to Scotland, where she was tortured and gave the names of more sup­posed accomplices. John Pian also escaped for a brief time, and tried to hide himself near his home in Saltpans, but was recaptured and was executed on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in january 1591, after the most terrible tortures that James c ould conceive to use upon him."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 Fian was killed in the usual way, by strangulation at the stake, im­mediately before his body was burned. John Grierson, who had his name spoken aloud at the Halloween sabbat, died in prison. Agnes Sampson, who undoubtedly was a witch in the more conventional sense of one who predicts the future and makes magic charms, was strangled and then burned to ashes on Castle Hill. Barbara Napier may or may not have been a witch, but she cer­tainly led a charmed life. When her stake was prepared for her ex­ecution o n May 11, 159 1, and the townspeople had assembled to watch her be strangled and burned, her friends made the claim that she was pregnant, and her execution was delayed until this could be demonstrated to be either true or false. Her jury had refused to find her guilty of treason against the king, on grounds of insufficient evi­dence, which enraged James and led him to declare her verdict an \"assize of error. \" He called for a new trial against her, and started legal proceedings against the jury members themselves. His strident address to the jury has been preserved, and is known as his Tolbooth speech, because it occurred at the Tolbooth building in Edinburgh where the law courts were located (see Appendix C). There is no re­cord of Barbara Napier ever having been executed, so it may be that after the elapse of time the wrath of the king cooled, or her friends were able to provide reasons for him to mitigate his persecution of this woman. When Effie McCalyan discovered that her six lawyers were no help in her defense, she also tried the pregnancy ploy, but with less success than Barbara Napier. McCalyan was due to be burned alive on june 19, 159 1, but when she declared that she was with child , her execution was delayed. She could not have been very convinc­ing, since she was executed on June 25, only a week after making her plea. There may have been a last-minute mitigation in the severity of her punishment, since contemporary records show that McCalyan was not burned alive, but was strangled first in the usual manner for executing witches. Just before being strangled, McCalyan made a"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 INTRODUCTION statement to the spectators declaring that she was innocent of all the crimes charge d against her. There can be little doubt, in view of the persecution of Bothwell by James, that the king firmly believed Bothwell to be the leader in the North Berwick affair. On April17, 1591, Bothwell confronted the king and his council and demanded to know what james intended to charge him with. Robert Bowes wrote of the meeting to Lord Burghley, \"The King answered, with practice to have taken his life. Bothwell asked if he would lay any other matter than that only. The King said it sufficed, and willed him to clear himself thereof.\" In May of 1591 the king began to actively work to have Bothwell tried for witchcraft and high treason. On May 9, Bothwell was held in Ed­inburgh Castle for \"conspyringe the King's death by sorcerye.\" On June 25 a proclamation was issued against Bothwell accusing him of \"consultatioun with nygromancris, witcheis, and utheris wickit and ungodlie prsonis, bayth without and within this cuntre for bereving of his Hienes lyff.\" The king was unable to muster enough support to have Both­well, who was a powerful man, put on trial, so he sent Bothwell out of Scotland. In June he wrote to john Maitland: \" Sen theire can na present tryall be hadd of the Erl Bothuell, I thinke best he praepaire him self to depairt uithin threttie or fourtie dayes, his absence to be na neirairhande nor Germanie or Italie.\" His fear of Bothwell's power of magic probably played a part in this decision, although i t may also have had political motives. In the spring of 1592 Bothwell sent a letter to the ministry de­fending himself against the rumors and charges gathering over his head like a thundercloud, but the king was not to be denied. The next year, in August, Bothwell was finally tried. Most of the evi­dence against him came from the accusations of a minor courtier and would-be necromancer named Richard Graham. When the de­fense was able to demonstrate that Graham had never accused Both­well of anything until after threatened with torture and execution"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 for witchcraft, and that he was promised his release and continuing protection if he spoke against his master, Graham's testimony was discredited. This, coupled with the testimony of many accused of witchcraft in the North Berw ick affair that they knew nothing of Bothwell other than his reputation as a man of noble character, pro­cured Bothwell's acquittal. The North Berwick affair exerted a profound influence in shap­ing laws against witchcraft, and the attitudes of the general popu­lation of Scotland, England, and New England toward witches and magic, for more than a century. Its influence was not finally lifted until the repeal of the witch statute of james in 1736. It is impos­sible to understand the character of james the First without know­ing how deeply shaken he was by the supposed magical plots on his life at the time of his marriage. His reaction to the alleged statement by the Devil in the North Berwi ck church that james was his great­est foe was to cast himself into the role of the white knight of God who dispensed the wrath of heave n against the wicked, using as his weapon the power of the word. SE PARATING TRUTH FROM FICTION Although it is not possible to know with any exactitude how much of the testimony extracted under torture, or threat of torture, from those accused in the North Berwick affair was true and how much a mere fabrication to forestall further suffering, there is enough infor­mation available to construct a plausible scenario explaining the principal motives and main events surrounding the trials. In 158 9 James married Anne of Denmark by proxy. Hence when she sailed to Scotland she was already queen, though the marriage had not been consummated. On the way the Danish fleet encoun­tered a terrible storm that sprang a plank on Anne's own ship, so that it began to take on water. The Danish admiral guiding Anne to her new home, Peter Munk, put in at Oslo, Norway, for repairs. This was the same storm that sank the ferryboat carrying Lady Mary"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 INTRODUCTION Melville across the Firth of Forth from Burntisland to Leith to meet with the Queen and present her with jewels and other gifts. James must have regarded this storm with suspicion even as he made the impetuous decision to sail to Oslo and remain with his new bride over the winter. His voyage was uneventful, and his wed­ding night successful, but Peter Munk, a superstitious man who had already in his own mind attributed the storm to the malicious magic of witches in Denmark, must have filled the imagination of James w ith frightening conjectures. He and Anne would have ample op­portunity to discuss the prevalence of witchcraft in her homeland on the long and snowy nights that James spent in Denmark with his wife. James himself may have been instrumental in initiating the great witchhunt that took place in Copenhagen in the summer of 1590, although by that time he was back in Edinburgh with Anne. Their return voyage was hindered by the same sort of unnatu­ral weather that had prevented Anne' s initial coming into Scotland. Even though the ships that accompanied James and Anne sailed as a fleet, his ship was the only one that encountered contrary winds. They also ran into dense fog, but with the help of the English navy, they were safely guided into port without tragedy. Whatever suspi­cions had been aroused in the mind of the King by the first storm, and by the superstitious opinions of Admiral Munk, were confirmed by this foul wind and treacherous mist. Magic was afoot, and was being worked against him specifically to prevent his union with Anne. Who would have a reason to want him to remain without a wife? Someone who desired that he should not engender a child and suc­cessor. It would not have taken james long to narrow the list of can­didates. Among the nobility of Scotland, no one held him in lower regard than the heroic warrior of the Border Marches, Francis, Earl of Bothwell. James viewed Bothwell with contempt because of his dubious birth and lack of refinement and learning. He probably also envied Bothwell for his courage. Bothwell, for his part, regarded"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 23 james as a sniveling cleric with pretensions of scholarship and an ar­rogant air of superiority that was unfounded on any virtue in his nature . The two men truly despised each other. It is quite possible that Bothwell had a reputation as a necromancer, whether merited or not, and this would only have served to confirm the suspicions of james . These suspicions might never have born fruit had not the deputy­bailiff of Tranent, David Seaton, decided to torture his maid about her nocturnal disappearances and her suddenly acquired skill as a healer. It is significant that among those first named by Gilly Dun­can in her confession was Agnes Sampson, the renowned midwife and healer known as the Wise Wife of Nether-Keith. Sampson was indeed a witch. This is persuasively indicated by the content of the numerous accusations made against her. However, she was not a witch by the definition of james, who believed that all witches had made a pact with Satan to work evil , and who met with the Devil periodically for carnal unions. She was, as her rustic title indicates, a wise woman, one who employed spoken prayers and natural ma­terials for use in midwifery, healing, divination, and such relatively innocuous activities as the manufacture and sale of love charms. It is not unre asonable to speculate that Gilly Duncan's sudden skill in healing had been acquired through her friendship with Agnes Sampson. Perhaps on some of the nights Duncan spent away from the residence of her master, she was studying the art of witchcraft from the elder Sampson. She must have been a gifted pupil, to judge by her success in healing her neighbors, but it was inevitable that the appearance of this gift, where none had been noticed to exist before, should give rise to rumors and gossip about her doings at night. If Gilly Duncan was an apprentice to magic, Agnes Sampson was its mistress. She was the first of the accused in the North Berwick affair to be extensively questioned, and the list of accusations against her is longer and more varied than against any other. The accusa­tions also differ in quality. The majority of the crimes Sampson was"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 INTRODUCTION charged with involved healing the sick or divining information of a harmless or personal nature on behalf of her clients. These charges have an air of plausibility that is lacking in the wild charges that con­cern conventions with the Devil and sailing over the sea in sieves. Sampson was a professional witch. She made her living not only as a midwife but as a healer and prognosticator. The testimony sur­rounding her activities shows that she was a shrewd judge of human nature , able to play upon the superstitions and fears of her clients to force them to pay their bills and to increase the fame of her powers of witchcraft. James became interested in the Sampson interrogation late in 1590. We can only speculate about what may have attracted his at­tention to the case. Probably Sampson was asked if she had been responsible for the storms that hindered the union between the King and Queen, which must still have been a topic of conversation only a few months after the second storm. By this point, Sampson' s will had been broken. The humiliation of having her entire body shave d and probed with a sharp instrument more like a dagger than a pin, the probing having been concentrated in her genitals and other se­cret places of the body, must have overwhelmed her natural dignity. Coupled with the ordeal of the witches' bridle she was made to wear to prevent her uttering charms, and the deprival of her sleep, these indignities rendered her willing to say anything at all in the hope of shortening her ordeal. Sampson was a clever woman and vain about her abilities. When at one point James jumped up in fury and declared that she was a liar, Sampson took him aside and convinced him of her power by telling him secret matters he had whispered to his wife on their wed­ding night in Oslo. James was astounded, and from then onward had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused. What Sampson did was nothing that would have been beyond the ability of any competent fortuneteller adept in the art of reading facial expressions, and who knew how to present information acquired long ago through ordi-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 25 nary channels as occult revelations. It is even possible that she did indeed possess some degree of psychic ability. Why she did it is obvi­ous-as long as the King thought she was lying, he would continue to have her tortured. Once he believed that she was telling the truth, the torture would stop. Much of the underlying structure of the events attributed to the accused in the North Berwick affair was supplied by Agnes Sampson, who as a true witch was able to provide details about magic prac­tices, such as the use of joints, or knucklebones, from corpses, and the casting into the sea of a cat to cause a storm. She probably had not employed either of these methods herself, but she would have had knowledge of them. James, having read deeply in the works of the Continental demonologists such as Weyer and the occult writ­ers such as Agrippa, was perfectly capable of supplying any material that was lacking that concerned the association and allegiance of the accused to the Devil . The confession of Agnes Sampson was the evidence James had been looking for that the storm that had almost taken the life of his wife, and the contrary wind that had delayed his voyage home, were the work of the Devil. As God's anointed upon the Earth, and as the living embodiment of the brave knight of Revelation, mounted upon the white horse, robed in white linen stained with the blood of the wicked, wearing many crowns, who used as his weapon the power of the word, James saw it as not only his duty, but his destiny, to confront Satan and triumph over him. That is why he involved himself personally in the interrogations and tortures of the accused. When he suggested to Sampson that her magic was directed against him, she was eager to agree as a way of stopping her torture. As Agnes Sampson continued to name names, and more sus­pected witches were questioned, at some point the focus moved beyond the small rural region around Saltpans and Tranent and en­larged to embrace Edinburgh. In the beginning only those of lower social standing were implicated. However, Sampson in her capacity"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 INTRODUCTION of midwife and healer had moved in higher circles, and had become acquainted with those of wealth and title. That she ever knew Both­well is doubtful, but she testified that Bothwell had asked her to di­vine how long james should reign, and what would happen after his death; and that he had induced her to send her familiar spirit to kill the king, but that it had failed. One of those arrested of higher social standing was Barbara Na­pier, a personal friend of the Earl of Bothwell. She wrote to him in April 1591, telling him to stand fast, that his enemies were conspir­ing against him, so it is clear that Napier was asked leading ques­tions about his involvement in the affair, though she refused to im­plicate Bothwell. The letter came open during transit, and was read by many, and its contents found their way back to the King, who was left in no doubt concerning a connection between the accused witches and Bothwell. Near the end of 1590 a courtier of limited importance named Richard Graham was taken into custody. Graham practiced some form of magic, though it would be the height of charity to call him a necromancer. Bothwell had felt sorry for the man, because Gra­ham had been excommunicated, and had given him shelter. Both­well only saw him a few times. He testified at his trial in 1593 that once, in an attempt to impress him, Graham had shown him \"a sticke with nickes in yt all wrapped about with lange haire eyther of a man or a woman, and said yt was an enchanted stick.\" This may have been a rune staff, and the nicks carved into its sides may have been runes, though it is impossible to know either the details of the stick' s appearance or its intended function. Another time Graham tried to sell Bothwell a ring with a familiar spirit inside it. Bothwell paid scant attention to Graham, his stick, or his ring. Graham simply was not important enough to occupy the attention of the Earl. When he was taken in the North Berwick affair, having been im­plicated by the confession of those already arrested, Graham was confronted with a simple choice. He could accuse Bothwell of being"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 27 the leader of the witches, and the instigator of their magical attacks against the King, whereupon he would be released and given physi­cal protection for the rest of his life-which he would need, since Bothwell had a great many friends-or Graham could remain silent and suffer unimaginably agonizing tortures until his execution on Castle Hill. At Bothwell's trial several defense witnesses testified that Graham had told them \"tht he must eyther accuse the Erle Both­well falselye , or els endure such tormentes as no man were able to abyde.\" Graham's own brother testified that Graham had \"protested to him that he was forced to accuse the Erle Bothwell for feare of maymynge with the bootes and other tortures.\" It is easy to see why Bothwell was acquitted. Yet these testimo­nies had no effect on James, who continued to believe that Bothwell was his enemy, had tried to murder him numerous times by magic, and was a great necromancer. James was convinced that the more vigorously he persecuted those he viewed as the servants of the Devil, the less power the Devil would have to harm him or anything that was his. This included not only his wife and household but the entire nation of Scotland. By using the utmost severity against the accused witches, James was defending his realm against the power of Satan. John Fian, who figures so prominently in the tract News From Scotland, seems to have had very little to do with anything. There is no plausible evidence that he knew magic, or had ever practiced magic. He was simply an easy target, a well-known young man who through his work as a teacher came into contact with a large num­ber of local people, and through his strong sexual appetites had car­nal knowledge of a great many women, some of whom were mar­ried. In the sixteenth century anyone who could read and write, and who had much to do with books written in Latin or Greek, was apt to be suspected by the uneducated people around him of possessing forbidden knowledge."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 INTRODUCTION The only two accused in the affair who can be demonstrated to have had both knowledge and practice of magic are Agnes Samp­son and Richard Graham. Sampson's magic, though extensive, was confined mostly to good works. The testimony that she used her arts to cause harm and death, having been extracted by torture , is worthless. Graham was a dabbler trying to impress his betters with his arcane kn owledge. Gilly Duncan and Bothwell may or may not have had some slight acquaintance with magic. In my opinion, no significant evidence exists to show that there ever was a plot to kill Kingjames, or that there was any form of organized witchcraft in the North Berwick area. The only devil in the affair wore the crown of Scotland. DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENTS OF DEMONOLOGY Demonology is in the form of a dialogue between two men, Philomathes and Epistemon. They meet and begin to talk about the \"strange news\" that i s the only subject of conversation lately, the doings of witches. Philomathes is a bit skeptical about the real­ity of witches and witchcraft, but Epistemon, who is obviously the alter ego of King James himself, uses his powers of logical argu­ment and his depth of learning t o convince his friend that witchcraft does exist, and that every form it takes is a serious crime because all witchcraft involves dealings with the Devil. Many of his examples are drawn from the Bible. In Book One of the work, after arguing that there is indeed such a thing as witchcraft, and that i ts practice is sin, Philomathes divides the arts of magic into two branches, one that he calls magic or nec­romancy, and the other sorcery or witchcraft. Magicians or necro­mancers are those who are allured to this sin by a curiosity after obscure and deep learning; sorcerers or witches are motivated by either a thirst for revenge against others or a desire for gain. Episte­mon ultimately rejects what he calls the vulgar distinction between"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 29 these two types of occult practices, although there is much to be said for the brevity and clarity of the popular definitions: \"Sure ly, the difference the vulgar put between them is very merry, and in a man­ner true; for they say, that the witches are servants only, and slaves to the Devil; but the necromancers are his masters and commanders.\" Epistemon divides the occult arts into what he terms the Devil's school and the Devil's rudiments. The first is the study of the ma­gicians and necromancers, who are often men of great learning. It involves complex circles, conjurations, numerous types of spiritual beings, and divine words of power. The second, the rudiments, is the study of the unlearned sorcerers and witches, and involves the manipulation of common words, herbs, and stones for the making of what Epistemon terms \"unlawful charms\" that operate without natural causes. Philomathes, the skeptic, objects that many of the practices that fall under these definitions have always been regarded as lawful and harmless, such as the practice of astrology. Epistemon divides astrol­ogy proper into two branches, the observation of the natural effects of the heavenly bodies on the seasons and the weather, which he re­gards as not strictly unlawful when used in moderation, and the use of such observations to foretell the future, which is always unlaw­ful in his opinion, even though such practices are widely condoned. From this unlawful type of astrology spring many other pernicious forms of divination, such as palm reading and numerology, all of which he condemns on the grounds that foretelling the future by the planets and stars is forbidden in the Bible. The study of necromancy is said not in itself to be an offense, although it is perilous, but the use of magic circles and conjurations is always unlawful, in the opinion of Epistemon, since no one can be a student in a school without being subject to the master of that school, and the master of the school of magic is the Devil. Although the magician may start out using magic circles and words of power to bind the Devil and his servants, Epistemon asserts that he quickly"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 INTRODUCTION moves toward the making of a pact with Satan. Philomathes is a bit skeptical as to why a magician should give up the circles and other aspects of his art that allow him to rule and control demons, and instead voluntarily subject himself to the Devil' s authority by means of a contract. The answer of Epistemon seems a bit weak on this point. He asserts that the conjuration of spirits by means of a magic circle is long and arduous, and that if the magician has omitted or spoiled even one detail in the process, he will immediately be seized by the Devil and carried away to hell, whereas if he enters into a pact with Satan, he can summon familiar spirits easily and safely to do his bidding for the term of the contract. The two enter into a discussion of what the pact with the Devil entails, and what benefits it provides, and of the different types of fallen angels. Epistemon denies that there are elemental spirits on the grounds that the fallen angels did not fall by gradations of weight, to be differentiated into the various elemental layers, but fell all together according to their nature , and wander the world as God's hangmen, ready to execute his wrath upon the wicked. He also denies the complex hierarchies of fallen spirits such as are printed in the grimoires, on the grounds that the order of heaven was broken when these angels fell into hell; and in any case, we can­not know what their hellish hierarchies may be because God would not permit this information to be conveyed by demons. The Devil is not to be trusted. Some of his revelations are true, the better to beguile humanity, but the rest are false. Concerning the black pact itself, Epistemon states that it is ei­ther written out in the magician's own blood or is signified by a mark which the Devil makes somewhere on the body of the magi­cian. Unlike the witch's mark, the magician's mark is not necessar­ily visible. Philomathes asks why it is that whereas witches are universally condemned and persecuted, many states not only allow magicians to live untroubled, but rejoice in demonstrations of their skill. He"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 31 offers two possible justifications: fi rst, that it is the long-held custom, and second, that Moses was himself a magician. Epistemon counters with the argument that an evil custom should never be considered a good law. As to Moses working magic, he doubts that was ever the case, but suggests that if Moses did study or even practice the magic of Egypt, he did so before he was called upon by God. He asserts that magicians should be punished with exactly the same severity as witches. In Book Two of the work, Philomathes raises three objections to the existence of witchcraft. The first, which has a bearing on the lan­guage of the Kingjames version of the Bible, is that many scholars believe that the references to magic in the Bible refer to magicians and necromancers only, not to witches. The second is that those who believe themselves to practice witchcraft are mentally ill and self-deluded. The third objection is that if witches really possessed all the powers that are claimed for them, there would be no godly person left alive on the face of the Earth. Epistemon agrees that many referred to in the Bible who used magic were necromancers and magicians, but asserts that others were witches, according to the vulgar definition of a witch being one controlled or ruled by the Devil. As to the objection that witches are afflicted with melancholy madness, he argues that they exhibit none of the symptoms of melancholy. The answer to the third ob­jection is that the Devil himself is bridled by God in the amount of harm he can work, so naturally his chosen instruments are similarly limited. Epistemon defines the term \"sorcery,\" that it signifies the casting of a lot, and divides sorcerers into two types according to their sta­tion in life. The rich are motivated to practice sorcery by a desire for revenge against others, while the poor practice it in the hope that it will lead to the acquisition of money or goods. The Devil comes to the sorcerer or witch while they brood in sol­itude, either as a disembodied voice or in the form of a man, and he"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 INTRODUCTION asks them what is troubling them. Then the Devil offers to remove all their difficulties if they follow his advice and do all he requires o f them. So much for the first meeting. At the second encounter the Devil persuades the candidate to pledge service to him, then reveals himself to the witch, compels the witch to renounce God, and gives the witch a mark on some hidden part of the body where it will not be easily noticed. The mark remains unhealed and extremely painful until the time of the third meeting, when the Devil heals it as a dem­onstration of his power. Forever thereafter it remains completely in­sensible to pain. At the third meeting the Devil also begins to teach the new witch the art of witchcraft. Philomathes inquires what are the practices of the witch, and Epistemon divides them into two classes: actions pertaining to them­selves, and actions pertaining to others. The first consists mainly of meeting in groups to worship Satan. The main form of adoration in­volves kissing the Devil on the buttocks. Epistemon lists some of the supposed powers of witches employed in getting to these meetings, such as flying through the air, making themselves invisible, trans­forming into small beasts so that they can find their way through the smallest crack into a sealed house, and causing their souls to leave their bodies while they lie in a trance. Flying, Epistemon believes, is possible when the Devil carries the witch, but the agency of a great wind could not be used for a longer time than the witches could hold their breath, or they would suffo­cate. Invisibility is also possible in his view, by the Devil thickening the air to conceal the witch from sight. He offers the opinion that the transformation of witches into small animals to pass through tiny cracks is implausible, but says the Devil can simulate the appear­ance of this change. He also rejects the concept of the soul leaving the body, since surely this only occurs after death, and it is not in the Devil's power to restore the dead to life. Philomathes asks what the actions of witches are directed against others. Epistemon answers that witches first gather in churches, and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 33 at these gatherings propose their intended evil doings to the Devil, who approves them and also instructs the witches on the meth­ods. His friend interrupts him, asking why there are twenty female witches for every male witch. Epistemon's response is the stock an­swer of the demonologists-women are inherently weaker than men, and ever since the Serpent deceived Eve, he has been more at home tricking women than men. The ways of witches for working evil are examined by Episte­mon. They are pictures of wax or clay bearing the name of the in­tended victim that are roasted over a fire, occult poisons that receive their active virtues from the Devil, spells that cause love or hate, the spreading of diseases, the raising of tempests, the inducing of mad­ness, the causing of spirits to haunt persons or houses, and the caus­ing of individuals to become possessed. Philomathes wonders whether God would permit such misfor­tunes to befall men and women who believe in him, and Epistemon assures him that witches can afflict both the godly and the wicked. Is it ever lawful to seek out a witch for a cure to a disease that has been caused by witchcraft? Never lawful, Epistemon assures his friend; the only lawful remedy is prayer. If all men are subject to the evil effects of witchcraft, Philomathes asks how any man can be brave enough to punish them. His friend rather stiffly replies that we should not refrain from virtue merely because the way may be perilous; and in any case, no one is more protected against witchcraft than those who zealously prosecute witches. The magistrate who sits in judgment over a witch is pro­tected from her malice in proportion to the degree of his severity toward her-the more lenient he is, the more he is in danger. On the contrary, if the magistrate applies the just laws of God in a rigorous way to the examination and punishment of witches, God will pro­tect him. In response to the question, does the Devil visit witches while they languish in prisons, Epistemon says that Satan only visits the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 INTRODUCTION unrepentant witch, in order to give false hope, but he never comes to the witch who has repented and rejected him. When he does visit a prison, the Devil comes to apprentice witches in the form they pre­viously agreed that he would adopt when coming to them, but to master witches he comes in any form he pleases or deems best for his purposes, which he can easily do since his body is composed of air. How can he be felt by witches if his body is of air, Philomathes wonders. Epistemon admits that there is not much on this matter contained in the confessions of witches, but he believe s it is done ei­ther by the Devil animating and possessing a corpse, or by deluding the witches' sense of touch. As to whether others can see the Devil when he comes to witches in prison, Epistemon says sometimes yes, sometimes no. The talk shifts to why spirits and ghosts were com­monly seen when Scotland was Catholic, but are very rare now that it is Protestant; yet at the same time, witches we re rare in past times, but are now become common. Epistemon puts it down to the gross ignorance of the papists, which caused God to punish them with night terrors, whereas in the present the error is one of arrogance, punished by God with an abounding of witchcraft. Book Three opens with a consideration of the four main sorts of spirits: spirits that haunt houses or deserted places, spirits that fol­low and trouble individuals, spirits that enter into and possess indi­viduals, and the spirits commonly known as fairies. Yet all these four types are really only one type, asserts Epistemon, who take on vari­ous shapes and perform various offices to more efficiently plague mankind. Epistemon explains that the first type received different names from the ancients depending on their works. Those that haunted houses were called lemures, or specters, but if they appeared in the form of a dead man to his friends, they were termed \"shades of the dead.\" They haunt deserted places rather than large gatherings because God will not permit the Devil to dishonor the societies of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 35 Christians, and besides, men are more apt to be frightened in lonely places. When they haunt an inhabited house, it is a sure sign that those who live there are ignorant of God's laws, or are wicked. Philomathes wants to know how such a spirit can enter a house the doors and windows of which are sealed. Epistemon is not en­tirely convincing in his answer. If the spirit possesses the body of a dead person, it can easily open a door or window without any great noise, he says, but does not explain how the spirit bypasses locks or bolts. Philomathes wonders if God would allow a spirit to desecrate a body. It is no desecration, says Epistemon, because the soul is ab­sent. The Devil can as easily cause the disinterment for his purposes of the body of a godly man as one who is ungodly. What is the best way to banish a spirit from a house? Two ways, says Epistemon, prayer to God and the amending of a life of sin. In response to Philomathes' query about the spirits that appear to impersonate the newly dead to his friends, Epistemon says they are called \"wraiths\" in English, and were very common among the pagan nations, where they were believed to be good spirits sent to forewarn them of the death of their friend or teach them the way of his end, but all this was only the deception of the Devil. What about werewolves, asks Philomathes. Are they not a form of this kind of spirit? His learned friend agrees that this was the opinion of the Greeks, but for his own part, he believes them nothing more than men afflicted with a melancholy humor that has unhinged their reason and made them run wild. The next two types of spirits are those who either trouble men by following them or by possessing their bodies. This only happens to those of the worst sort who are guilty of serious offenses, as a punishment of God; or to the best sort of persons, as a test of their faith. Why should the Devil bother doing God's work for him in this way, Philomathes wonders, and his friend replies that the Devil has two goals: the lives and the souls of those he persecutes in this manner."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 INTRODUCTION Considering the spirits that follow after men, Philomathes ob­serves that there are two sorts, those who trouble the individuals they associate with, and another kind that does them good service and warns them against future dangers. He asks whether the second sort are what is known as guardian angels. Epistemon retorts that the pagan belief that everyone has a good angel and an evil angel is a gross error, but that in Christian times the Devil attempts the same sort of fiction by sending spirits that a re known as brownies into houses to do necessary work, in order to make the inhabitants believe that they are good spirits. But what possible reason could the Devil, who is only interested in doing evil, have for sending spirits to do good? Is it not reason enough, demands Epistemon, to deceive the ignorant into believing the Devil to be their friend? Another type of following spirit is treated, those called incubi or succubi, who have sex with women or men. Philomathes wants to know if they exist, and if there is any difference of sex among spirits. Epistemon replies that this sort of spirit operates either by stealing the sperm of dead men and injecting it into women, which caused many nuns to be burnt, or else by animating a corpse. Either way, the sperm used by the Devil is always icy cold. Epistemon denies that spirits have any inherent sexual differentiation, since the division of the sexes is confined to living things , or that such spirits can en­gender monsters. The seed of a dead man cannot impregnate, being also dead, and if the seed of a living man is stolen and used, over­looking for the moment the fact that it would cool down and be­come infertile in transit, the child engendered will be normal, since the seed is normal. However, the Devil can make a woman who is not pregnant get a swollen belly, and appear to be pregnant, and on such occasions the midwife may pretend that she has given birth to something monstrous. Philomathes raises the interesting question as to why incubi and succubi are more common in northern lands, such as Lapland, Fin­land, or the islands of Orkney and Shetland. His learned friend sets"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 37 this down to the greater ignorance of their populations. Do any give their willing consent to the lovemaking of this class of following spirit? Some witches do, Epistemon admits, and they are to be pun­ished and detested, but as for those women who suffer this indignity unwillingly, they are only to be pitied and prayed for. Philomathes wonders if what is called \"the mare\" is this type of sexual spirit, but he is answered that the mare is only a kind of natu­ral sickness caused by thick phlegm lying over the heart, and giving the impression that a weight is holding the body down while at the same time sapping the body of its strength to move. Two matters interest Philomathes concerning the class of pos­sessing spirits: how can the possessed be distinguished from the in­s ane, and how can the priests of the Catholic church, being heretics, cast these spirits out? There are various ways to tell a person pos­sessed from one who is insane, Epistemon tells him. The possessed fear the cross and the name of God, have unnatural strength and agility, and have the power to speak in languages they never learned, which they do in a hollow voice that seems to emanate from the breast rather than the mouth. As for how the priests can cure the possessed, usually the cure is not permanent but only temporary, and when it is permanent, as it sometimes is, the cure proceeds not from any virtue of the priests but from the virtue of Christ, when the priests follow his instructions for exorcism, which are fasting, prayer, and that the action be done in his name. Progressing to the last class of spirits, the fairies, Epistemon de­clares that stories about them were much more common under the papists, but that for his part, he does not believe in their existence, except on occasions when they are mere deceptions of the Devil. Philomathes objects that many men have gone to their deaths swear­ing that they were transported by the fairies into a hill, where they met the fairy queen and receive d from her a magic stone that they were able to produce in evidence. His friend responds that in the s ame way the Devil can make men believe that their soul can leave"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38 INTRODUCTION their body, so can he deceive them into thinking they have visited fairyland while they lie senseless in a trance, and can convey a com­mon stone into their hand. And when they see those they know among the fairies, and take this for an omen of the imminent deaths of those persons, it is only another trick of the Devil. Philomathes wonders if fairies only appear to witches, or can appear to others also? To both, says Epistemon. They come to oth­ers either to frighten them or to impersonate a cleaner sort of spirit than they really are, but to witches they serve as a way of persuading gullible magistrates that they ought to be punished with less severity. The first group should be pitied, but those who use these spirits for divination deserve an even more severe punishment than the aver­age witch, because they are less honest. The two discuss briefly the question of the multitude of names of spirits. Epistemon dismisses this as just another knavery of the Devil, used for the purpose of deception. As they approach the end of their conversation, they consider the matter of suitable punishment for magicians and witches. Epis­temon states flatly that they should be put to death. In what way, he is asked. Commonly it is done by fire, but any form of execution accepted by the laws of the nation will serve as well. Should any sex, age, or rank be exempted from this punishment? None at all, says Epistemon. Not even children, asks Philomathes. Yes, but only because they are not yet capable of reason. All the rest, those who consult, or trust in, or turn a blind eye to, or entertain, or incite to magic are just as guilty as those who practice it, and should be put to death. May the prince or chief magistrate spare the life of one guilty of witchcraft? He may delay the punishment, says Epistemon, if he has good reason for doing so, but must not shirk to apply it in the end. Philomathes observes that judges ought to beware condemning any unless they are sure the accused is guilty, and his friend agrees that no one should be condemned on the testimony of only one"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 39 man of poor reputation. How much weight is to be given to the multiple confessions of the guilty in finding against the accused? Epistemon gives his opinion that since in cases of treason defamed persons may act as witnesses, their testimony should also be suffi­cient in cases of witchcraft, which is treason against God; for who but witches can prove the doings of witches? What if witches accuse others of having been present at their imaginary conventions, while their physical bodies lie in trance, Philomathes wants to know. In the view of Epistemon, such persons are not a hair the less guilty, since the Devil would never dare to bor­row their image to place at the witches' convention without their consent. And consent in these matters is death under the law. Think­ing to score debating points with his learned friend, Philomathes quickly answers, then Samuel must have been a witch, since the Devil borrowed his shape to appear before Saul. But his friend is ready for this argument-Samuel was already dead at the time and for this reason could not be slandered by the Devil. God never per­mits innocent persons to be slandered in this way, says Epistemon, and as proof of this, those who are carried away by the fairies never see the shade of anyone in the fairy court who is not involved in some way with witchcraft. Indeed, those whom witches accuse, even when witchcraft cannot be actually proved against them, al­ways turn out to be of evil life and reputation. There are two methods for determining a witch, according to Epistemon. One is to find the witch mark and test that it is insensi­tive to pain. The other is the floating of the accused person on the water. Those who have renounced the sacred water of baptism and refused its benefits are themselves rejected by water, which will not receive them into its depths; indeed, they cannot even shed tears no matter how much you threaten or torture them, despite the fact that women cry dissembling tears like crocodiles at the lightest of occasions."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40 INTRODUCTION The two friends, having exhausted their topic, say goodbye to each other. Philomathes offers the hope with his final words that God will purge Scotland of the scourge of witchcraft, which was never before so common as it is now. Epistemon offers his last snip­pet of erudition by observing that the reasons for it are manifest. On the one hand, the great wickedness of the people has procured this punishment of God; while on the other hand, the approa ching end of the world causes Satan to be all the more anxious to work as much evil as he can before his power is ended. And so ends the discourse. NOTE ON THE ORIGINAL TEXTS This new edition of Demonology by James the Sixth of Scotland, who would later go on to become James the First of England, is designed to make this historically important book on witchcraft and magic fully accessible to the modern reader. The original text was penned during the late Elizabethan Age. Its spelling is archaic, and its para­graphing and sentence construction irrational, rendering a complete comprehension of the material an ordeal. Understanding is further inhibited by the many obsolete Scottish terms that pepper the book. These terms would not have been immediately familiar even to educated individuals in the south of England in the same decade in which the work was written, and to the average reader of today they are incomprehensible. While modernizing the work, I endeavored wherever possible to retain the words and prose structure used by James. Where it was nec­essary to substitute a modern equivalent in place of an archaic Scottish word, I tried to not only find the closest synonym but the word that best preserved the sound and connotation of the original. Biblical refer­ences that appear as abbreviated marginal glosses in the original have been expanded and inserted into the body of the text in parentheses. In the few instances where words have been interjected into the text to clarifY its meaning, they are enclosed in square brackets. Those who"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 4I wish to compare the modernized version with the original, or who need the original text fo r purposes of reference or quotation, will fm d it in Appendix A. Once the difficulty in comprehending the text itself is sur­mounted, there is still the problem of the numerous obscure refer­ences to magic and witchcraft made by James throughout the work. The explanatory notes that appear at the end of each chapter will help the reader to understand not only what James wrote but what he meant. Woodcuts from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries have been inserted were applicable to further clarify topics mentioned by James. The modernized text of Demonology is based on the 1924 Bodley Head reprint of the original 1597 edition of the work. The Bodley Head reprint also contains the full text of a 1592 edition of the tract News From Scotland and reproductions of its woodcuts. The title pages of the original editions of Demonology and News From Scotland included with the present work, along with the woodcut illustrations of News From Scotland, were derived from the Bodley Head edition. News From Scotland has long accompanied Demonology, and for good reason. The events it details were the impulse that triggered the lifelong battle waged by James against witchcraft, and inspired him to write Demonology. James regarded witchcraft as a personal threat because he believed that his death had been plotted by the accused men and women involved in the New Berwick witch affair, described in the tract. He looked upon Satan as a personal fo e. In the testimonies of these supposed witches, spoken in the presence of the King, the Devil was reported to have identified James as his greatest enemy. The authorship of News From Scotland is not know, but it may have been based on an account of the North Berwick affair written by James Carmichael, the Minister of Haddington. Sir James Mel­ville recorded in his Memoirs that Carmichael had written \" the his­tory whereof, with their whole depositions.\" The work itself was"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 INTRODUCTION written in England rather than Scotland, to judge by the language and other internal evidence. William Wright, the publisher, is un­likely to have been the author, but probably edited the work exten­sively. Although 1591 appears on the title pages of early editions, that date refers to the execution of John Fian. The work has been dated at 1592, though the document upon which it was based was probably written in the latter half of 1591. Copies of the first edition are extremely rare-only a handful sur­vive. Two other editions, also undated, were published shortly after the first printing of the work, probably in 1592, with slight variations in the format of the title page. The original contained two wood­cuts. One of the other early editions duplicated the first of these il­lustrations at the start of the work. The 1924 Bodley Head reprint was based on this edition with the duplicate woodcut, and contains two other woodcuts that obviously were not created for the work itself but were added for decorative purposes. The early editions are in black letter, except for the section To the Reader and the concluding section, which are in Roman typeface. News From Scotland is here treated as a natural companion to De­monology. Its text has been similarly modernized, and its matter illu­minated by a complete set of notes that provide information about the larger context of the North Berwick witch trials not covered in the tract. The original text appears in Appendix B for purposes of comparison with the modernized version and quotation. Appendix C is occupied by a modernized version of the full text of the infamous witch act, or witchcraft statute, of 1604, passed by the English parliament shortly after the ascension of James to the throne of England. Also in this appendix is a modernized version of the Tolbooth Speech, which James uttered in 1591 after overturning the acquittal by an Edinburgh jury of one of the accused witches he believed had plotted to kill him with magic. Both documents convey very clearly the attitude of the king toward witchcraft and its legal prosecution."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 43 Modernization of the texts, coupled with the explanatory notes, introductory essay, and additional period illustrations, make these unique documents of the witch persecutions in Scotland fully ac­cessible to all readers, especially to modern Wiccans and pagans, for whom the doings during the reigns of James are not mere historical abstractions but matters of direct interest and concern."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE PREFACE to the Reader The fearful abounding at this time, in this country, of these detest­able slaves of the Devil, the witches or enchanters, has move d me (beloved reader) to dispatch in the post, this following treatise of mine, not in any way (as I protest) to serve for a show of my learn­ing and ingenuity, but only (moved by conscience) to press thereby, so far as I can, to resolve the doubting hearts of many both that such assaults of Satan are most certainly practiced, and that the instru­ments thereof merit most severely to be punished, against the dam­nable opinions of two principally i n our age. Whereof, the one called Scot, 1 an Englishman, is not ashamed in public print to deny that there can be such a thing as witchcraft, and so maintains the old error of the Sadducees in denying spirits. The other called Wierus,Z a German physician, sets out a public apology for all these craftsfolk/ whereby, procuring for their impunity, he plainly betrays himself to have been one of that profession. And to make this treatise more pleasant and easy, I have put it in the form of a dialogue, which I have divided into three books: the first speaking of magic in general and necromancy in particular, the second of sorcery and witchcraft, 4 the third containing a discourse of all these kinds of spirits and specters that appear and trouble per­sons, together with a conclusion of the whole work. 45"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"4 6 DEMONOLOGY: PREFACE My intention in this labor is only to prove two things, as I have already said: the one, that such devilish arts have been and are; the other, what exact trial and severe punishment they merit. And there­fore I reason what kind of things are possible to be performed in these arts, and by what natural causes they may be: not that I touch every particular thing of the Devil's power, for they are infinite, but only, to speak scholastically (since this cannot be spoken in our lan­guage), I reason upon genus, leaving species and diffirentia to be com­prehended therein. 5 As, for example, speaking of the power of magicians in the first book, sixth chapter, I say that they can suddenly cause to be brought unto them all kinds of dainty dishes by their familiar spirit, since as a thief he delights to steal, and as a spirit he can subtly and suddenly enough transport the same. Now, under this genus may be compre­hended all particulars, depending thereupon, such as bringing wine out of a wall (as we have heard of to have been practiced) and such things, which particulars are sufficiently proved by reasons of the general. And similarly, in the second book of witchcraft in particular, the fifth chapter, I say and prove by diverse arguments that witches can, by the power of their Master, cure or cast on diseases. Now, by these same reasons that prove their power by the Devil of diseases in general, is as well proved their power in particular, as of weak­ening the nature of some men to make them unable for women, 6 and making it to abound in others more than the ordinary course of nature would permit, and such like in all other particular sicknesses. But one thing I will pray you to observe in all these places where I reason upon the Devil's power, which is the different ends and scopes that God as the first cause, and the Devil as his instrument and second cause, shoots at in all these actions of the Devil (as God's hangman): for where the Devil's intention in them is ever to kill ei­ther the soul or the body, or both of them, that he is so permitted to deal with, God by the contrary draws ever out of that evil, glory to himself, either by the wreck of the wicked in his justice, or by the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: PREFACE 47 trial of the patient and amendment of the faithful, being wakened up with that rod of correction.

Weyer, whose last name is sometimes spelled \"Wi­erus,\" annoyed James in a number of ways-by revealing practical details of ceremonial magic, by defending the reputation of his teacher Cornelius Agrippa, who was widely regarded as a sor­cerer, and by denying the powers of witchcraft, as shown by his quotation from the Decretum of Gratian: This very phenomenon is confirmed by the Decretum: \"Cer­tain silly women who are devoted to Satan and who have been seduced by demonic illusions believe that they also commit other unspeakable deeds, such as tearing young children away from their mother's milk and roasting and eating them, or en­tering into homes through chimneys and windows and disturb­ing the inhabitants in various ways. But all of these things and others like them happen to them only in fa ntasy.

Here, he was punning on \"craft\" in the sense of slyness and deceit. Note 4: james regarded magic as synonymous with necromancy, and sorcery as synonymous with witchcraft. The best definition of the distinction between these two branches of the occult arts that James can find is what he refers to as \"the difference vulgar put betwixt them\" (Bk. I, Ch. III): that magicians and necroman­cers are the Devil's masters, but sorcerers and witches are the Devil's servants. He did not accept this definition, believing as he did that all who work any form of magic will eventually fall under the power of Satan, but he could not present a more concise or meaningful alternative. If we leave the Devil out of the mix, the distinction is very similar to what we today call high magic and low magic. High magic involves elaborate rituals, circles, pentacles, divine names, and words of power; whereas low magic is more concerned with intuitive healing, scrying, and the occult properties of natural things such as herbs and stones. High magic tends to be some­what intellectual and abstract, low magic to be immediate and intuitive. High magic has its roots in the wisdom teachings of Egypt and Greece; low magic has arisen largely from the indig­enous practices of northern Europeans. Neither branch of Western occultism can be said to exist in a pure form in modern times, and even four centuries ago, witches probably derived at least some of their methods from the grimoires of high magic, especially when they were led and instructed by educated individuals. Those who could read and write were more likely to study high magic because its methods"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"50 DEMONOLOGY: PREFACE were available in manuscripts and printed texts; the uneducated were inclined to seek to acquire the folk wisdom of divinations and charms directly, by observing and imitating the practices of their elders. In the sixteenth century, the division between magi­cians and witches was based largely on social class, since stand­ing in society determined the level of education, or lack of it. As Charles Leland put it, \"it was only the aristocracy who consulted Cornelius Agrippa, and could afford Ia haute magie\" (Leland, Gypsy Sorcery and Fo rtune Telling, page xxxiii). Note 5: James was making the point that he has based his argument on general principles that comprehend specific instances. Note 6: The Malleus Maleficarum lists five ways that a man may be rendered unable to copulate by the Devil, enumerated by Peter of Palude: first, by physically preventing a man from approach­ing a woman; second, by freezing his desire with \" secret things of which he best knows the power;\" third , by making the woman appear loath some; fourth, by directly preventing erection of the penis; fifth, by preventing the emission of semen (Kramer and Sprenger, Malleus Maleficarum, page 55). Witches were also sup­posed to have the power to take away the male genitals entirely so that only a smooth patch of skin remained between the legs, though it is argued in the Malleus Maleficarum that this is only a type of glamour (ibid., page 58).

He had children tortured to extract confes­sions, and was reluctant to admit even the possibility that anyone accused of witchcraft might be innocent. His book on witchcraft, De la demonomanie des sorciers, more commonly known in English as Demonomania, published in 1580, may have offended the puri­tanical sensibilities of James with its explicit sexual references­for example, Bodin wrote that the Devil sexually seduces girls as young as the age of six.

Epistemon I shall with good will do the best I can. But I think it the more dif­ficult, since you deny the thing itself in general, for as it is said in the logic schools, contra negantem principia non est disputandum.2 Always for that part, that witchcraft and witches have been, and are, the former part is clearly proved by the Scriptures, and the last by daily experience and confessions. Philomathes I know you will produce as evidence Saul's Pythoness,3 but that, as appears, will not make much for you. Epistemon Not only that place [in Scripture], but diverse others. But I marvel why that should not make much for me? Philomathes The reasons are these: first, you may consider that Saul, being trou­bled in spirit and having fasted long before, as the text testifies (I Samuel 28), and being come to a woman that was reputed to have such knowledge, and that to inquire so important news, he having so guilty a conscience for his heinous offences, and especially, for that same unlawful curiosity and horrible defection, that the woman cry­ing out upon the sudden in great admiration for the uncouth sight that she alleged to have seen, discovering him to be the king, though disguised, and denied by him before, it was no wonder, I say, that his"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK 57 senses being thus distracted, he could not perceive her fe igning of her voice, he being himself in another chamber and seeing nothing. Next, what could be, or was, raised? The spirit of Samuel? Pro­fane and against all theology. The Devil in his likeness? As unappar­ent, that either God would permit him to come in the shape of his saints (for then could neve r the prophets in those days have been sure what spirit spoke to them in their visions), or then that he could foretell what was to come thereafter; for prophecy proceeds only of God, and the Devil hath no knowledge of things to come. Epistemon Yet if you will mark the words of the text, you will find clearly that Saul saw that apparition; for, giving you that Saul was in another chamber at the making of the circles and conjurations needful for that purpose (as none of that craft will permit any others to behold at that time), yet it is evident by the text that how soon that once that unclean spirit was fully risen, she called in upon Saul. For it is said in the text, that Saul knew him to be Samuel, which could not have been by the hearing tell only of an old man with a mantle, since there were many more old men dead in Israel than Samu el, and the common dress of that whole country was mantles. As to the next, that it was not the spirit of Samuel, I grant, in the proving whereof you need not insist, since all Christians of whatso­ever religion4 agree upon that, and none but either mere ignorants or necromancers or witches doubt thereof. And that the Devil is per­mitted at some times to put himself in the likeness of the saints, it is plain in the Scriptures, where it is said that Satan can transform himself into an angel of light (II Corinthians 11: 14). Neither could that cause any inconvenience with the visions of the prophets, since it is most certain that God will not permit him so to deceive his own, but only such as first willfully deceive themselves by running unto him, whom God then suffers to fall into their own snares, and justly permits them to be deluded with great efficacy of deceit, because they would not believe the truth (as Paul says)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"58 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK And as to the Devil's foretelling of things to come, it is true that he knows not all things future, but yet that he knows part, the tragic event of this history declares it (which the wit of woman could never have forespoken5); not that he hath any prescience which is only proper to God, or yet knows anything by looking upon God, as in a mirror (as the good angels do), he being forever debarred from the favorable presence and countenance of his creator, but only by one of these two means: either, as being worldly wise, and taught by continual experience ever since the creation, he judges by the like ­lihood of things to come according to the like that has passed be­fore, and the natural causes in respect of the vicissitude of all things worldly; or else, by God's employing of him in a turn, and so fore­seen thereof, as appears to have been in this, whereof we find the very like in Micaiah's prophetic discourse to King Ahab (I Kings 22). But to prove this my first proposition, that there can be such a thing as witchcraft and witches, there are many more places in the Scriptures than this (as I said before). As first, in the law of God it is plainly prohibited (Exodus 22);6 but certain it is that the law of God speaks nothing in vain, neither doth it lay curses or enjoin punish ­ments upon shadows, condemning that to be ill which is not in es­sence, or being, as we call it. Secondly, it is plain, where wicked Pha­raoh's wise men imitated any number of Moses' miracles (Exodus 7-8) to harden the tyrant's heart thereby. Thirdly, said not Samuel to Saul (I Samuel 15) that disobedience is as the sin of witchcraft?7 To compare to a thing that were not, it were too too absurd. Fourthly, was not Simon Magus (Acts 8) a man of their craft? And fifthly, what was she that had the spirit of Python?

Note 2: 'There is no disputing a negative premise.\" Note 3: The Python was an enormous serpentine dragon that guarded the oracle of Gaia at Delphi, on the slope of Mount Par­nassus. The god Apollo slew the Python and took over the oracle, making it his own. The oracle was a woman who was known as the Pythoness. She sat above a fissure of rising gases upon a tripod or three-legged seat, her body positioned so that the steam from the fissure rose between her legs and was presumed to enter her womb. Whether as a result of breathing this vapor, or from some natural inclination of her nature, she fell into pro­phetic trances during which she uttered future events in the form of enigmatic verses. The term \"Pythoness\" came to be applied generally to any woman who uttered oracular information, and is synonymous with \"prophetess.\" To have a spirit of Pytho, or spirit of Python, is to be possessed by a familiar spirit that speaks oracular information. Note 4: Catholic or Protestant. Note 5: \"To forespeak\" has two meanings, \"to prophesy\" and \"to bewitch.\" Here, James employs the term in the first sense. Note 6: In the Kingjames Bible, Exodus 22:18 reads: \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" There has been considerable debate among modern Wiccans and pagans as to what the word \"witch\" actually represents in the original Hebrew text. In the Knox trans­lation of the Bible, which is considered to be one of the most ac­curate, the verse reads \"Sorcerers must not be allowed to live.\" However, Knox has added the footnote, \"In the Hebrew the word is feminine, 'witch.\"' The Hebrew word in question is MKShPH,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"60 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK a feminine form of the word MKShP, which Gesenius translates as \"enchanter\" or \"magician.\" The Hebrew word is based upon KShP, \"to use enchantment\" -to use magical songs, to mutter. Hence the best translation would seem to be \"enchantress.\" In Isaiah 8: 19 reference is made to \"wizards that peep and that mutter. \" This quaintly worded description concerns the two ways in which those who used magic were supposed to work evil on their neighbors. The first way is through the use of the evil eye, which is sometimes referred to as \"overlooking.\" The sec­ond supposed manner of projecting evil was through verses or charms spoken quietly under the breath, which James refers to later in his book as \"forespeaking.\" \"To enchant\" is to do magic through the use of spoken or sung words. The Vulgate uses maleficus in place of \"witch,\" which is to say, one who does wickedness. It appears in the title of the most no­torious of all the books on witch persecution, the Malleus Malefi ­carum, or Hammer of Wi tches. The Latin term malefi cia was some­times employed for noxious creatures such as serpents. Since the Latin is only an interpretation of the Hebrew and Greek verses, it is not relevant in attempting to determine what the Hebrew orig­inal actually means, but it exerted a profound influence on the interpretation of the verse over the centuries. The word \" witch\" in the KingJames Bible has often been presumed, unjustly, to be a mistranslation of the words \"poisoner\" or \"murderer. \" King James recognized no distinction between a sorcer­ess and a witch. Both terms held for him a connotation of one who works magic for evil. For him, the translation of MKShPH as \"witch\" seemed perfectly appropriate, particularly since he believed that female witches outnumbered their male counter­parts by a ratio of twenty to one.

Since the sev­enteenth century, all astrology is judicial astrology in this broad sense. James was distinguishing judicial astrology from natural astrology, which in the sixteenth century was the observation of the movements of the stars and planets in order to predict natural events such as solar and lunar eclipses, and to establish the dates of the equinoxes, solstices, and holy days such as Easter. We now class natural astrology as a part of astronomy. Note 6: Divine names play a central role in Western high magic. Drawn from the Old Testament, they embody both the power and the authority of God.

During the Renaissance the previously secret teachings of the system of Jewish mysticism and magic known as the Kabbalah became known to Europeans, and began to be employed by magi­cians. Cornelius Agrippa wrote extensively about the uses of the Hebrew names of God in the third book of his Occult Philosophy.

All ways, as I may, I shall shortly satisfy you in that kind of conjurations which are contained in such books which I call the Devil's school.

For it is he only, the father of all lies, who having first of all prescribed that form of doing, feigning himself to be commanded and restrained thereby, will be loath to pass the bounds of these in­junctions; as well thereby to make them glory in the empiring over him (as I said before), as likewise to make himself so to be trusted in these little things, that he may have the better commodity thereafter, to deceive them in the end with a trick once and for all, I mean the everlasting perdition of their soul and body. Then, laying this ground, as I have said, these conjurations must have few or more in number of the persons, conjurers (always pass­ing the singular number)2 according to the quality of the circle, and form of apparition. Two principal things cannot well in that errand be wanted: holy water (whereby the Devil mocks the Papists) and some present of a living thing unto him.3 There are likewise cer­tain seasons, days, and hours, that they observe in this purpose.4 These things being all ready, and prepared, circles are made trian­gular, quadrangular, round, double, or single, according to the form of apparition that they crave.5 But to speak of the diverse forms of the circles, of the innumerable characters and crosses that are within and without, and throughout the same, of the diverse forms of ap­paritions that that crafty spirit deludes them with, and of all such particulars in that action, I remit it to overmany that have busied their heads in describing of the same, as being but curious, and alto­gether unprofitable.

If this be not now a just cause to make them weary of these forms of conju­ration, I leave it to you to judge upon; considering the longness of the labor, the precise keeping of days and hours (as I have said), the terribleness of apparition, and the present peril that they stand in, in missing the least circumstance or freit that they ought to observe. And on the other part, the Devil is glad to move them to a plain and square dealing with him, as I said before. NOTES ON BOOK I, CHAPTER V Note 1: This is an important point. Someone like Cornelius Agrippa or John Dee could publicly proclaim themselves well versed in the techniques of necromancy or natural magic, and could even pub­lish books on the subject, without placing themselves at risk of legal prosecution, provided they could prove that they had never put their knowledge into practice. A danger always existed for those who studied magic that their friends or neighbors would accuse them of actually working it. When John Dee was accused of being a magician during the reign of James the First, he was eager to force a trial so that he could prove his innocence and regain his reputation. On June 5, 1604, just four days before the witchcraft statute of James was passed into law by the English Parliament, Dee sent James ape­tition in which he demanded that the king should \"cause your Highnesse said servant to be tryed and cleared of that horrible and damnab le, and to him most grievous and dammageable sclaunder, generally, and for these many yeares last past, in this kingdom raysed and continued, by report and Print against him,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK 85 namely that he is or hath bin a conjurer or caller or invocator of divels\" (Smith,john Dee: 1527-1 608, page 293). In 1592 Dee had been called in print \" the conjuror of the Queen's Privy Council.\" This still rankled with Dee, but presum­ably more recent gossip had impelled his petition to James. Dee's audacity is quite breathtaking, since his own records of the com­munications he had years before conducted with a hierarchy of spirits identifying themselves as the angels who had instructed Enoch in a system of heavenly magic were evidence enough to have had him hanged a thousands times. However, Dee's hand­written transcripts of the angelic communications were kept carefully hidden by Dee, and did not come to light until after his death. Dee's petition was ignored. It may be that James saw noth­ing to be gained by putting on public trial one of the favorites of Queen Elizabeth. Dee lived out the last years of his life widely regarded as a magician, which, indeed, he was, and thoroughly detested by James, who remained convinced that the gossip about Dee was true. James refused to give Dee any financial aid when he was in dire need, and there is no question that he would have liked nothing better than to have watched Dee hanged as a witch. Perhaps he respected Dee's legal knowledge and oratorical skills enough to suspect that an accusation of witchcraft might fail against him, or perhaps Dee had a friend or two left. In any event, no formal accusation was ever made against him. Note 2: It is sometimes specified in the grimoires that the magician should have an assistant or assistants, though there is no obvious reason for this directive. Note 3: james meant the blood sacrifice of a beast. Animal sacri­fice is mentioned in some of the grimoires, either dire ctly or in­directly. For example, in the most celebrated of all the grimoires, the Key of Solomon, the directions concerning animal sacrifice read:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK In many operations it is necessary to make some sort of sac­rifice unto the Demons, and in various ways. Sometimes white animals are sacrificed to the good Spirits, and black to the evil. Such sacrifices consist of the blood and sometimes of the flesh. They who sacrifice animals, or whatsoever kind they be, should select those which are virgin, as being more agreeable unto the Spirits, and rendering them more obedient. When blood is to be sacrificed it should be drawn also from virgin quadrupeds or birds, but before offering the oblation, say: May this Sacrifice which we find it proper to offer unto ye, noble and lofty Beings, be agreeable and pleasing unto your de­sires; be ye ready to obey us, and ye shall receive greater ones. (Mathers, The Key of Solomon the King, page 119). Note 4: This was known as the observation of times, and was ex­pressly forbidden in the Old Testament. In Leviticus is written: \"Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood; neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times\" (Leviticus 19:26). In Deuter­onomy we read: \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch .... For these nations, which thou shalt possess, har­kened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God has not suffered thee to do so\" (Deuteronomy 18:10, 14). Operations in ritual magic were believed only to beef­fective when done under auspicious aspects of the stars and plan­ets, and in the hours dedicated to spirits helpful to the work. It was generally held that if rituals were performed at the wrong time, they would fail."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK 87 Figure 4 Note 5: Evil spirits considered dangerous to deal with were called forth to visible appearance into a triangle, while the magician and his assistants stood within the protective circle, or circles.

It is to be made at 2 feet distance from the Magical Circle and it is 3 feet across. Note that this triangle is to be placed toward that quarter whereunto the Spirit belongeth. And the base of the triangle is to be nearest unto the Circle, the apex pointing in the direction of the quarter of the Spirit. Ob­serve thou also the Moon in thy working\" (Mathers, Goetia, pages 71-72).

The spirit is induced to come into being within the triangle through the point at the apex of this vortex. These matters were not spelled out in the texts of the grimoires, but were details transmitted from teacher to student, as indeed they still are today. The refer­ence in the Goetia to observing the Moon in the working is an example of the observation of times. The waning phase of the Moon is most appropriate for the evocation of evil spirits. Note 6: The fanciful tale is told of the student of Cornelius Agrippa who, one day when his master was away from home, took out Agrippa's book of conjuration and summoned a demon. The demon demanded of the student why he had been summoned, and when the terrified youth was too overcome with dread to respond, the demon immediately killed him. Upon returning home, Agrippa was confronted with his corpse, which the magi­cian was forced to spirit away by magic lest he be implicated in the student's death. I t need hardly be added that this story has not one shred of truth in it. However, it does illustrate the belief that to step outside the magic circle during evocation, or to make an error in the words spoken or procedures enacted, was to risk death at the hands of the thing called.

The quality of these forms and effects is less or greater, accord­ing to the skill and art of the magician. 1 For as to the forms, to some of the baser sort of them he obliges himself to appear at their call­ing upon him, by such a proper name which he shows unto them, 2 either in the likeness of a dog, a cat, an ape, or suchlike other beast; or else to answer by a voice only. The effects are to answer to such"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK demands, as concerns curing of diseases, their own particular house­work, or such other base things as they require of him. But to the most curious sort, in the forms he will oblige himself to enter in a dead body, and there out of, to give such answers of the event of battles, of matters concerning the estate of common­wealths, and such like other great questions;3 yea, to some he will be a continual attender, in the form of a page;4 he will permit himself to be conjured, for the space of so many years, either in a table5 or a ring, 6 or suchlike thing, which they may easily carry about with them. He gives them power to sell such wares to others, whereof some will be dearer, and some better cheaper, according to the lying or true speaking of the spirit that is conjured therein. Not but that in very deed, all devils must be liars, but so they abuse the simplicity of these wretches, that become their scholars, that they make them believe that at the fall of Lucifer, some spir­its fell in the air, some in the fire, some in the water, some in the land; in which elements they still remain. 7 Whereupon they build, that such as fell in the fire, or in the air, are truer than they who fell in the water or in the land; which is all but mere gossips, and forged by the author of all deceit. For they fell not by weight, as a solid substance, to stick in any one part; but the principal part of their fall, consisting in quality, by the falling from the grace of God wherein they were created, they continued still thereafter, and shall do until the latter day, in wandering through the world, as God's hangmen, to execute such turns as he employs them in. And when any of them are not occupied in that, return they must to their prison in hell (as it is plain in the miracle that Christ wrought at Gennesaret (Matthew 8)), therein at the latter day to be all enclosed forever. And as they deceive their scholars in this, so do they in imprint­ing in them the opinion that there are so many princes, dukes, and kings among them, every one commanding fewer or more legions, and empiring in diverse arts, and quarters of the earth.8 For though that I will not deny that there be a form of order among the angels"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK 9I in heaven, and consequently, was among them before their fall, yet either that they brook the same since then, or that God will permit us to know by damned devils such heavenly mysteries of his, which he would not reveal to us neither by Scripture nor prophets, I think no Christian will once think it. But to the contrary, of all such mys­teries as he hath closed up with his seal of secrecy, it becomes us to be contented with a humble ignorance, they being things not neces­sary for our salvation. But to return to the purpose, as these forms wherein Satan obliges himself to the greatest of the magicians are wonderful cu­rious, so are the effects correspondent unto the same. For he will oblige himself to teach them arts and sciences, which he may easily do, being so learned a knave as he is; to carry them news from any part of the world, which the agility of a spirit may easily perform; to reveal to them the secrets of any persons, so being they be once spoken: for the thought, none knows but God, except so far as you may guess by their countenance, as one who is doubtlessly learned enough in the physiognomy. Yea, he will make his scholars to creep in credit with princes, by foretelling them many great things, part true, part false, for if all were false he would lose credit at all hands; but always doubtsome, as his oracles were. For no man doubts but he is a thief, and his agility (as I spoke before) makes him to come [with] such speed. Likewise, he will guard his scholars with fair armies of horsemen and footmen in appearance, castles and forts: which are all but impres­sions in the air, easily gathered by a spirit drawing so near to that sub­stance himself. As in like manner he will learn them many jugglery9 tricks at cards, dice, and suchlike, to deceive men's senses thereby; and in such innumerable false practices, which are proven by overmany in this age, as they who are acquainted with that Italian called Scoto, yet living, can report. And yet are all these things but deluding of the senses, and nowise true in substance, as were the false miracles wrought by King Pharaoh's magicians, for counterfeiting Moses's. For"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK this is the difference between God's miracles and the Devil's: God is a creator, what he makes appear in miracle, it is so in effect, as Mo­ses's rod being cast down, was no doubt turned into a natural serpent; whereas the Devil (as God's ape) counterfeiting that by his magicians, made their wands to appear so, only to men's outward senses, as shown in effect by their being devoured by the other. For it is no won­der that the Devil may delude our senses, since we see by common proof, that simple jugglers will make a hundred things seem both to our eyes and ears otherwise than they are. Now as to the magician's part of the contract, it is in a word that thing which, I said before, the Devil hunts for in all men. Philomathes Surely you have said much to me in this art, if all that you have said be as true as wonderful. Epistemon For the truth in these actions, it will be easily confirmed to any that pleases to take pains upon the reading of diverse authentic histo­ries, and the inquiring of daily experiences. And as for the truth of their possibility, that they may be, and in what manner, I trust I have alleged nothing whereunto I have not joined such probable reasons, as I leave to your discretion, to weigh and consider. One word only I omitted, concerning the form of making of this contract, which is either written with the magician's own blood, 1 0 or else being agreed upon (in terms) his school master touches him in some part, though peradventure no mark remains, as it does with all witches. 11 NOTES TO BOOK I, CHAPTER VI Note 1: Spirits of greater power and authority assume shapes that are more refined and complex, whereas spirits of lesser power take on the shapes of simpler and lower forms of life.

The more skilled the magician, the more potent the spirits he is able to summon and employ, and the more refined and complete their manifestation. Francis Barrett commented in a footnote concerning the forms of the spirits of Saturday: \"Those spirits who appear in a kingly form have a much higher dignity than them who take an inferior shape; and those who appear i n a human shape, exceed in authority and power them that come as animals; and again, these latter surpass in dignity them who appear as trees or in­struments, and the like: so that you are to judge of the power, government, and authority of spirits by their assuming a more noble and dignified apparition\" (Barrett, The Magus, Bk II, Part III, page 127). Figure 5"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"94 DEMONOLOGY: THE FIRST BOOK Note 2: The first act of a magician after making contact with a spirit is to demand of the spirit its true name, by which it may be sum­moned and controlled. Lower spirits are reluctant to divulge their names, but may be compelled to do so by the authority of the names of God or the names of the angels that rule over them. This is why the purity of the magician is so often stressed in the grimoires. In order to use a name of God or a name of an angel to command a lower spirit that has been evoked, it is necessary for the magi cian to invoke that aspect of God, or that angel, into himself, so that he becomes the vessel of God or the angel. Only then can he speak with the power and authority of the holy name to command the lower spirit to reveal its true identity. Once the name of the lower spirit is known, it can be effectively used to command the spirit to appear and do whatever work the magi­cian requires of it. Note 3: This is the primary activity of necromancy. john Dee's crys­tal scryer, the alchemist Edward Kelley, is reputed to have exhumed the corpse of a pauper from his grave in the churchyard of Wal­ton-le-Dale, near Preston in Lancashire , with the help of a friend named Peter Waring. This was done at the request of a young man of wealth and social position, who wished Kelley to animate the corpse with necromantic magic and compel it to reveal the young man's term of life and future prospects. The success or failure of the effort has not been recorded, but in my opinion the story itself is very likely true. This instance of graverobbing took place before Kelley entered into Dee's employ, and it is probable that Dee never knew anything about it. Contrary to some reports, Dee was not present at the time, since he and Kelley had yet to meet. Dee met Kelley in the spring of 1582. Kelley's experiment in necromancy may have occurred around 1580.

Note 4: The Devil was supposed to appoint a demon to act as a fa­miliar to a magician with whom he had signed a pact. The most famous example is that of Mephistopheles, the familiar serving demon of the magician Faust. The relationship between Faust and his familiar is examined in the play The Tragical History of Doc­tor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe, and the play Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Note 5: The summoning of spirits into tables played a key part in the spiritualist movement of the nineteenth century. Spirits of the dead were supposed to enter into the table around which the me­dium and her clients were seated, then to respond to questions ei­ther with a series of raps from within the table, or by moving, lift­ing, or tipping the table so that its legs banged alternately against the floor. Note 6: Magicians commonly possessed rings containing familiar spirits. For example, the Greek sage Apollonius of Tyana was presented as a gift a set of seven rings containing spirits by the leader of the Brahmans of India. His biographer Philostratus wrote: \"And Damis says that Iarchas gave seven rings to Apollo­nius named after the seven stars, and that Apollonius wore each of these in turn on the day of the week which bore its name\" (Philostratus, Life of Apollonius, Bk III, Ch. XLI). A ring has the advantage of being always on the person of the magician, allow­ing instant access to the familiar spirit when its services may be required. Note 7: James refers to the elemental spirits of Paracelsus, the Sala­manders of Fire, the Sylphs of Air, the Undines of Water, and the Gnomes of Earth.

The notion that spirits are divided into the elements is quite old. It occurs in the Key of Solomon, but in a less orderly form than that established by Paracelsus: For when thou shalt have conjured any Spirits in any art or experiment, they will not come when the air is troubled or agi­tated by winds, seeing that Spirits have neither flesh nor bones, and are created of different substances. Some are created from Water. Others from Wind, unto which they are like. Some from Earth. Some from Clouds. Others from Solar Vapours. Others from the keenness and strength of Fire; and when they are invoked or summoned, they come always with great noise, and with the terrible nature of fire. (Mathers, Key of Solo­mon the King, page 82). Note 8: The seventy-two infernal demons of the Goetia are each given a rank and a certain number of legions of spirits under their command. For example, the demon Foras is called a mighty Presi­dent, and said to rule twenty-nine legions of spirits; Asmoday is said to be a great King, and to rule seventy-two legions. These seventy-two demons are in turn ruled by four demon kings, each presiding over one of the four quarters of the world: Amaymon rules the east, Corson the west, Zimimay the north, Goap the south (Mathers, The Goetia, page 67).

Grandier was accused by the nuns at the Ursuline convent at Loudun of causing them to become possessed by demons. He was tortured by Capuchin monks, but refused to confess, and was burned alive on August 18, 1634, \"together with all compacts and magical apparatus used by him\" (Robbins, Encyclopedia of Wi tchcraft and Demonology, page 315). Apparently some of his de­m onic contracts escaped the fire . Another document of Urbain Grandier is written in mirror script, and shows the highly distinc­tive signatures of six demons: Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan, Elimi, Leviathan, and Astaroth. Each signature is completely different in style from all the others. Leviathan used a particularly heavy hand with his pen, which is perhaps to be expected (Seligmann, The History of Magic, page 242).

As to the other reason, which seems to be of greater weight, if it were formed in a syllogism, it behooves to be in many terms and full of fallacies (to speak in terms of logic). For first, that that general proposition affirming Moses to be taught in all the sciences of the Egyptians, should [give cause to] conclude that he was taught in magic, I see no necessity. For we must understand that the spirit of God there , speaking of sciences, understands them that are lawful; for except they be lawful, they are but abusively called sciences, and are but ignorances indeed: nam homo pictus, non est homo.2 Secondly, giving that he had been taught in it, there is great dif­ference between knowledge and practicing of a thing (as I said be­fore), for God knows all things, being always good; and of our sin and our infirmity proceeds our ignorance. Thirdly, giving that he had both studied and practiced the same (which is no less than monstrous to be believed by any Christian), yet we know well enough that before that ever the spirit of God began to call Moses, he was fled out of Egypt, being forty years of age, due to the slaughter of an Egyptian; and in his good father Jethro's land, first called at the fiery bush, having remained there another forty years in exile: so that suppose he had been the wickedest man in the world before, he then became a changed and regenerate man, and very little of the old Moses remained in him.

For first, whereas the Scripture seems to prove witchcraft to be, by diverse examples, and specially by sundry of the same which you have alleged, it is thought by some that these places speak of magi­cians and necromancers only, and not of witches.

Thirdly, if witches have such power of witching of folks to death (as they say they have), there had been none left alive long since in the world but they; at least, no good or godly person of whatsoever estate could have escaped their devilry. Epistemon Your three reasons, as I take, are grounded the first of them upon Scripture; the second affirmative upon physic; and the third upon the certain proof of existence. As to your first, it is most true, indeed, that all these wise men of Pharaoh were magicians of art; as likewise it appears well that the Pythoness with whom Saul consulted was of that same profes­sion; and so was Simon Magus. But you omitted to speak of the law of God wherein are all magicians, diviners, enchanters, sorcerers, witches, and whatsoever of that kind that consult with the Devil, plainly prohibited, and alike threatened against. 2 And besides that, she who had the spirit of the Python in the Acts, whose spirit was put to silence by the apostle (Acts 16), could be no other thing but a very sorcerer or witch, if you admit the vulgar distinction to be in a manner true, whereof I spoke in the beginning of our conference. For that spirit whereby she acquired such gain to her master was not at her raising or commanding, as she pleased to appoint, but spoke by her tongue, as well publicly as privately; whereby she seemed to draw nearer to the sort of demoniacs or possessed, if that conjunc­tion between them had not been of her own consent, as it appeared by her not being tormented therewith, and by her acquiring of such gain to her masters (as I have already said).3"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK !07 As to your second reason, grounded upon physic, in attributing their confessions of apprehensions to a natural melancholic humor, any that please medically to consider upon the natural humor of melancholy, according to all the physicians that ever wrote there­upon, they shall find that that will be over-short a cloak to cove r their knavery with. For as the humor of melancholy in the self is black, heavy, and earthy, so are the symptoms there of, in any persons that are subject thereunto, leanness, paleness, desire of solitude, and if they come to the highest degree thereof, mere folly and mania. Whereas, by the contrary, a great number of them that ever have been convicted or confessors of witchcraft, as may be presently seen by many that have at this time confessed, they are by the contrary, I say, some of them rich and worldly wise, some of them fat or cor­pulent in their bodies, and most part of them altogether given over to the pleasures of the flesh, continual haunting of company, and all kinds of merriness, both lawful and unlawful, which are things directly contrary to the symptoms of melancholy whereof I spoke . 4 And further experience daily proves how loath they are to confess without torture, which witnesses their guiltiness; whereby the con­trary, the melancholies, never spare to betray themselves by their continual discourses, feeding thereby their humor in that which they think no crime. As to your third reason, it scarcely merits an answer. For if the Devil, their master, were not bridled, as the Scriptures teach us, sup­pose there were no men nor women to be his instruments, he could find ways enough without any help of others to wreck all mankind; whereunto he employs his whole study, and goes about like a roar­ing lion (as Peter says) to that effect (I Peter 5).

NOTES TO BOOK II, CHAPTER I Note 1: Refer to Acts 8:9-24. The name \"Simon Magus\" might be translated \"Simon the Magician,\" since magus is a Persian word that signifies \"magician.\" lrenaeus described a pre-Gnostic sect called the Simonians that supposedly traced its beginning to the teachings of Simon Magus. Simon was denounced by the Church fathers as the founder of Gnosticism, the source of all Gnostic doctrines, and the father of all heresy (Barnstone, The Other Bible, page 603). Saint Clement of Alexandria related the fable that when Simon was acting as court magician to Nero at Rome, Saint Peter went to confront him. To demonstrate his power, Simon flew out a window, whereupon Peter muttered a fervent prayer, and Simon dropped to the ground, breaking both his legs, and shortly thereafter died of his injuries. If the story has any truth, it might be speculated that Simon was a stage magician, that he flew out the window on wires, and that while suspended high above the ground, something mal­functioned with his apparatus. It is difficult to see how the prayer spoken by Paul at the time differs in any significant way in its in­tention from the malevolent forespeaking of a sorcerer resulting in death, so strongly condemned by James. Note 2: The condemnation in Deuteronomy 18:10-11 against all forms of occult practice is quite sweeping, and reads a bit like the all-inclusive language of James's own witchcraft statute of 1 604. Prohibited are those who use divination, those who observe times (astrologers), enchanters, witches, charmers, consulters with fa­miliar spirits, wizards, and necromancers.

It might be assumed that she was merely possessed, something that was believed to happen to many innocent individuals, we re it not that her prophecies brought great profit to her masters, and were it not that she obviously had consented to act as host for the spirit. The implied conclusion of James is that the spirit was her familiar. Note 4: Ancient medicine recognized four humors, or subtle fluids, flowing through the body. These humors took their prevailing nature from the elements with which they corresponded. Choler was hot and dry, like the element Fire . The humor of blood was moist and hot, like Air. Phlegm was cold and moist, like Water. Melancholy was dry and cold, like Earth. When the humors of the body were in balance, the result was physical and mental health . An imbalance of the humors resulted in disease. The primary pursuit of physicians was to restore the balance of the humors-hence, the practice of bleeding, which was designed to allow a superabundant humor to flow out of the body and restore a natural equipoise between the four. Imbal­ance in the humors not only produced sickness but eccentric and socially unacceptable behavior, and served as a source of amuse­ment for the English playwrights of the late sixteenth centu ry, as the titles of the comic plays by Ben Jonson, Every Man in his Humour (1598) and Every Man out of his Humour (1599), suggest. Shakespeare made extensive use of the theory of humors in the exaggeration of his characters, as did other Elizabethan and jaco­bean playwrights such as Marlowe and Webster. An ordinary excess of the cold and dry humor of melancholy results in what we call depression. It makes us sour, withdrawn, sullen, brooding, sluggish, and sad.

James referred to this sec­ond type of melancholy as the \"highest degree thereof.\" James was correct in asserting that witchcraft, as it is de­scribed in the testimonies of accused witches, does not corre­spond with common melancholy. Witches frequently testified that they gathered together, sang, danced, drank, made love, and otherwise enjoyed themselves in a manner quite out of keeping with the low form of melancholy, which results in withdrawal from society and inertia of mind and body. Whether witchcraft corresponds with heroic melancholy is a more interesting matter to consider. Some accused witches exhibited delusions of gran­deur, related wild and unrealistic plans, and reported fantastic vi­sions that are in harmony with the higher form of melancholy. However, since not all witches were the same, there is no reason to suppose that they all suffered from the same affliction.

But this far, which I have yet said, I not only take it to be true in their opinions, but even so to be in deed. For the form that he used in counterfeiting God among the pagans makes me so to think: as God spoke by his oracles, spoke he not so by his? As God had as well bloody sacrifices, as others without blood, had not he the like? As God had churches sanctified to his service, with altars, priests, sacri­fices, ceremonies, and prayers, had he not the like polluted to his ser­vice? As God gave responses by Urim and Thummim,2 gave he not his responses by the entrails of beasts,3 by the singing of fowls, and by their actions in the air?4 As God by visions, dreams, and ecstasies revealed what was to come, and what was his will unto his servants, used he not the like means to forewarn his slaves of things to come? Yea, even as God loved cleanness, hated vice and impuri ty, and ap­pointed punishments therefore, used he not the like (though falsely I grant, and but in eschewing the less inconvenient to drew them upon a greater); yet dissembled he not, I say, so far as to appoint his priests to keep their bodies clean and undefiled5 before their ask­ing responses of him? And feigned he not God, to be a protector of every virtue, and a just revenger of the contrary? This reason then moves me, that as he is that same Devil, and as crafty now as he was then, so will he not spare openly in these actions that I have spoken of concerning the witches' persons. But further, witches oftentimes confess not only his convening in the church with them, but his occupying of the pulpit; yea, their form of adoration, to be the kissing of his hinder parts.6 Which, though it seem ridiculous, yet may it likewise be true, seeing we read that in Calicut/ he appearing in form of a goat-buck, had publicly that dishonest homage done unto him by every one of the people.

This is an obvious error. I have returned this section of text to Epistemon. Note 2: Urim and Thummim were two mysterious objects carried by the high priest of Israel within the sacred breastplate bear­ing the twelve stones of the tribes (see Leviticus 8:8). They were used as an instrument of divination on important matters. When Joshua was publicly chosen to succeed Moses as leader of Israel, he was confirmed by the oracle of Urim (Numbers 27:21). The Hebrew word AVRIM means \"lights\"; the word ThMIM means \"truth. \" Both are plural fo rms. Philo Judaeus believed these ob­jects were two small images, the first representing revelation and the second truth. However, the biblical commentator Rashi states unequivocally that they were \" the writing of the Divine Name,\" that is, the fo ur Hebrew letters of Tetragrammaton. In my book Tetragrammaton I speculate that the oracle con­sisted of two disks, one of gold (Urim) and the other of silver (Thummim).

The manner of using the oracle is not known, but one of the disks may have indicated a yes and the other a no, when blindly drawn from within the breastplate; or the letters may have been used to spell out one of the twelve pos­sible permutations of the letters of the Name, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK 119 Note 3: Divination by the inspection of the still-warm entrails of a sacrificed beast was the method favored by the Etruscans, and was later adopted by the Romans as their preferred method of of­ficial divination.

Epistemon There is the thing which I esteem their senses to be deluded in, and though they lie not in confessing of it, because they think it to be true, yet not to be so in substance or effect: for they say that by diverse means they may convene, either to the adoring of their Mas­ter, or to the putting into practice any service of his committed unto their charge. One way is natural, which is natural riding, going, or sailing, at what hour their Master comes and advises them; and this way may be easily believed. Another way is somewhat more strange, and yet is it possible to be true: which is, by being carried by the force of the spirit which is their conductor, either above the earth or above the sea, swiftly to the place where they are to meet; which I am persuaded to be likewise possible, in respect that Habbacuc was carried by the angel in that form to the den where Daniel lay (Apoc­ryp ha of Bel and the Dragon)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"122 DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK So, think I, the Devil will be ready to imitate God as well in that, as in other things : which is much more possible to him to do, being a spirit, than to a mighty wind, being but a natural event, to trans­port from one place to another a solid body, as is commonly and daily seen in practice. But in this violent form they cannot be carried but a short bounds, agreeing with the space that they may retain their breath: for if it were longer, their breath could not remain un­extinguished, their bodies being carried in such a violent and forcible manner. As, by example: if one fall off a small height, his life is but in peril, according to the hard or soft landing; but if one fall from a high and steep rock, his breath will be forcibly banished from the body before he can win to the earth, as it oft seen by experience. 1 And in this transporting, they say to themselves that they are invisible to any other, except among themselves; which may also be possible in my opinion. For if the Devil may form what kind of impressions he pleases in the air, as I have said before, speaking of magic, why may he not far easier thicken and obscure so the air that is next above them by contracting is close together, that the beams of any other man's eyes cannot pierce through the same to see them?2 But the third way of their coming to their conventions is that wherein I think them deluded: for some of them say that being transformed into the likeness of a little beast or fowl, they will come and pierce through whatsoever house or church, though all ordinary passages be closed, by whatsoever opening the air may enter in at. And some say that their bodies lying still, as in ecstasy, their spir­its will be ravished out of their bodies, 3 and carried to such places. And for verifying thereof, will give evident tokens, as well by wit­nesses that have seen their bodies lying senseless in the meantime, as by naming persons with whom they met, and giving tokens what purpose was amongst them, whom otherwise they could not have known: for this form of journeying, they affirm to use the most when they are transported from one country to another."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Philomathes DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK 123 Sure ly, I long to hear your own opinion of this, for they are like old wives' tattles about the fire . Epistemon4 The reasons that move me to think that these are mere illusions are these. First, for them that are transformed in likeness of beasts or fowls, can enter through so narrow passages, although I may easily believe that the Devil could by his workmanship upon the air make them appear to be in such forms, either to themselves or to others, yet how can he contract a solid body within so little room? I think it is directly contrary to itself, for to be made so little, and yet not diminished; to be so tightly drawn together, and yet feel no pain. I think it is so contrary to the quality of a natural body, and so like to the little transubstantial God in the Papists' Mass, that I can never believe it. So to have a quantity, is so proper to a solid body, that as all philosophers conclude, it cannot be any more without one, than a spirit can have one. For when Peter came out of the prison, and the doors all locked (Acts 12), it was not by any contracting of his body in so little room, but by the giving place of the door, though unspied by the jailers. And yet is there no comparison when this is done, between the power of God, and of the Devil. As to their form of ecstasy and spiritual transporting, it is cer­tain the soul's going out of the body is the only definition of natural death: and who are once dead, God forbid we should think that it should lie in the power of all the devils in hell to restore them to their life again (although he can put his own spirit in a dead body, which the necromancers commonly practice, as you have heard), for that is the office properly belonging to God. And besides that, the s oul once parted from the body cannot wander any longer in the world, but to the one resting place must it go immediately, abid­ing the conjunction of the body again at the Latter Day. And what Christ or the prophets did miraculously in this case, it cannot, in any Christian man' s opinion, be made common with the Devil. As for"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"124 DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK any tokens that they give for proving of this, it is very possible to the Devil's craft to persuade them to these means. For he being a spirit, may he not so ravish their thoughts, and dull their senses, that their body lying as dead, he may appear to their spirits as it were in a dream, and (as the poets write of Morpheus5) represent such forms of persons, of places, and other circumstances, as he pleases to de­lude them with? Yea, that he may deceive them with the greater efficacy, may he not at that same instant, by fellow angels of his, delude such other persons so in that same fashion, whom with he makes them to be­lieve that they met: that all their reports and tokens, though sepa­rately examined, may every one agree with another. And that what­soever actions, either in hurting men or beasts, or whatsoever other thing that they falsely imagine at that time to have done, may by himself or his minions at that same time be done indeed. So as, if they would give for a token of their being ravished at, the death of such a person within so short space thereafter whom they believe to have poisoned or witched at that instant, might he not at that same hour have smitten that same person by the permission of God, to the further deceiving of them, and to move others to believe them? And this is surely the likeliest way, and most according to reason, which my judgement can find out in this, and whatsoever other un­natural points of their confession. And by these means shall we sail surely between Charybdis and Scylla,6 in eschewing the not believing of them altogether on the one part, lest that draw us to the error that there are no witches; and on the other part in believing of it, make us to eschew the falling into innumerable absurdities, both monstrously against all theology divine, and philosophy humane."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK 125 NOTES TO BOOK II, CHAPTER IV Note 1: Since the impact with the ground after a fall from a high place would cause death, it is difficult to know how James could assert that someone falling from a high place dies through loss of breath before striking the earth.

What can be the cause that there are twenty women given to that craft, where there is one man? Epistem.on The reason is easy, for as that sex is frailer than man is, so is it easier to be entrapped in these gross snares of the Devil, as was overwell proved to be true by the Serpent's deceiving of Eve at the beginning, which makes him the friendlier with that sex since then. Philomathes Return now where you left. Epistemon To some others at these times he teaches how to make pictures of wax or clay, 2 that by the roasting thereof, the persons that they bear the name of may be continua lly melted or dried away by continual sickness. To some he gives such stones or powders as will help to cure or cast on diseases. And to some he teaches kinds of uncouth poisons, which mediciners understand not (for he is far more cun­ning than man in the knowledge of all the occult properties of nature). Not that any of these means which he teaches them (except the poisons, which are composed of things natural) can of themselves help any thing to these turns, that they are employed in, but only being God's ape, as well in that, as in all other things.

And as to the effects of these two former parts, to wit, the con­sultations and the outward means, they are so wonderful as I dare not allege any of them, without joining a sufficient reason of the possibility thereof. For leaving all the small trifles among wives, and to speak of the principal points of their craft (for the common trifles thereof, they can do without converting well enough by themselves), these principal points, I say, are these. They can make men or women to love or hate [each] other, which may be very possible to the Devil to effect, seeing he being a subtle spirit, knows well enough how to persuade the corrupted af­fection of them whom God will permit him so to deal with. They can lay the sickness of one upon another, which likewise is very possible unto him: for since by God's permission, he laid sick­ness uponjob,1 why may he not far easier lay it upon any other? For as an old physician, he knows well enough what humor dominates most in any of us, and as a spirit he can subtly waken up the same, making it peccant or to abound, as he thinks meet for troubling us, when God will so permit him.

They can make folks to become frantic or maniac, which likewise is very possible to their Master to do, since they are but natural sick­nesses. And so he lays on these kinds, as well as any others. They can make spirits either to follow and trouble persons, or haunt certain houses, and affright oftentimes the inhabitants; as hath been known to be done by our witches at this time.5 And likewise they can make some to be possessed with spirits, and so to become very demoniacs: and this last sort is very possible likewise to the Devil their Master to do, since he may easily send his own angels to trouble in what form he pleases, any whom God will permit him to so use.

It was charged against John Pian at his trial of December 20, 1590, that at the command of the Devil he had dismembered the bodies of the dead, and especially unbaptised children. At the January 27, 1591, trial against Agnes Sampson she was accused of having fastened to the four legs of a cat four joints from a dead man, and of then having thrown the cat into the sea for the pur­pose of sinking a ship (the cat swam back to shore , and presum­ably was uninjured, apart from the assault on its dignity). She was also charged with having each night put the powder or \"mwildis\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE SECOND BOOK 133 of pulverized joints from corpses under the bed of Effie McCa­lyan, beginning ten days before she gave birth, for the purpose of reducing her labor pains.

This is perhaps the most characteristic of all forms of magic associated with witchcraft down through the centuries. Anything done to the image affects the subject of the image in a similar way. For ex­ample, a pin thrust into the head would induce a headache. Wax figures were \"roasted\" or melted over a fire to cause a wasting disease in their subjects-as the figure of wax dripped away, so did the vitality of the person it depicted. For the image, which was sometimes called a poppet, to be effective, it was necessary that the link with the person it represented be strong. Hence, such figures were embedded with the hair, nail clippings, or other waste products of the body secretly gathered from their subjects, baptized in the name of that person and inscribed with the name, and dressed in a scrap of clothing worn or used by the subject. The image might be made of almost any material. Indeed, onions were used for this purpose in England, wrapped with a strip of paper upon which the name of the intended victim was written, and affixed with pins, then inserted into a kitchen chimney to be constantly subjected to the heat and smoke of the fire (Elworthy, The Evil Eye, page 55).

And yet were these unlawful arts far rarer at that time, and never were so much heard of, nor so rife as they are now. Philomathes What should be the cause of that? Epistemon The diverse nature of our sins procures at the justice of God diverse sorts of punishments answering thereunto. And therefore as in the time of the Papistry, our fathers erring grossly and through igno­rance, that mist of errors overshadowed the Devil to walk the more familiarly among them, and as it were by childish and frightening terrors, to mock and accuse their childish errors. By the contrary, we now being sound of religion, and in our life rebelling to our profes­sion [of faith], God justly by that sin of rebellion, as Samuel calls it, accuses our life [for] so willfully fighting against our profession.4 Philomathes Since you are entered now to speak of the appearing of spirits, I would be glad to hear your opinion in that matter. For many deny that any such spirits can appear in these days, as I have said. Epistemon Doubtlessly, who denies the power of the Devil would likewise deny the power of God, if they could for shame. For since the Devil is the very contrary opposite to God, there can be no better way to know God, than by the contrary : as by the one's power (though a creature), to admire the power of the great Creator; by the false­hood of the one, to consider the truth of the other; by the injustice of the one, to consider the justice of the other; and by the cruelty of the one, to consider the mercifulness of the other.

Usually the word is applied to the first four books of the New Testament.

Philomathes I pray you now then go forward in telling what you think fabulous, or may be trusted in that case. Epistemon That kind of the Devil's conversing in the earth, may be divided in four different kinds, whereby he frightens and troubles the bodies of men; for of the abusing of the soul, I have spoken already. The first is, where spirits trouble some houses or solitary places. The second, where spirits follow upon certain persons, and at diverse hours trou­ble them. The third, when they enter within them and possess them. The fourth is these kinds of spirits that are called vulgarly the fairies. Of the three former kinds, you heard already how they may artifi­cially be made by witchcraft to trouble folk. Now it rests to speak of their natural coming, as it were , when not raised by witchcraft. But generally I must forewarn you of one thing before I enter into this purpose: that is, that although in my discoursing of them, I divided them into diverse kinds, you must notwithstanding thereof note my p hrase of speaking in that; for doubtlessly they are in effect, 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK but all one kind of spirits, who for abusing the more of mankind take on these sundry shapes, and use diverse forms of outward ac­tion, as if some were of nature better than others. Now I return to my purpose. As to the first kind of these spirits, they were called by the an­cients by diverse names, according as their actions were . For if they we re spirits that haunted some houses, by appearing in diverse and horrible forms, and making great din, they were called lemures1 or spectra.2 If they appeared in likeness of any deceased to some friends of his, they were called umbrae mortuorum.3 And so innumerable styl­ings they got, according to their actions, as I have said already. As we see by experience, how many stylings they have given them in our language in the like manner. Of the appearing of these spirits, we are certified by the Scriptures, where the prophet Isaiah, chapters 13 and 34, threatening the destruction of Babylon and Edam (Isaiah 13; Jeremiah 50), declares that it shall not only be wrecked, but shall become so great a solitude, as it shall be the habitation of owlettes, 4 and of ZIIM and IIM,5 which are the proper Hebrew names for these spirits. The cause why they haunt solitary places, it is by reason that they may frighten and shake the more the faith of such as them alone frequenting such places. For our nature is s uch, as in company we are not so soon moved to any such kind of fear, as being solitary, which the Devil knowing well enough, he will not therefore assail us but when we are weak. And besides that, God will not permit him so to dishonor the societies and companies of Christians, as in public times and places to walk visibly among them. On the other part, when he troubles certain houses that are dwelt in, it is a sure token either of gross ignorance, or of some gross and slanderous s ins among the inhabitants thereof, which God by that extraordinary rod punishes."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Philomathes DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 151 But by what way or passage can these spirits enter in these houses, seeing they allege that they will enter, door or window being shut? Epistemon They will choose the passage for their entrance, according to the form that they are in at that time. For if they have assumed a dead body, whereinto they lodge themselves, they can easily enough open without din any door or window, and enter thereat. And if they enter as a spirit only, any place where the air may come in at is large enough an entry for them: for as I said before, a spirit can occupy no quantity. Philomathes And will God then permit these wicked spirits to trouble the rest of a dead body, before the resurrection there of? Or if he will so, I think it should be of the reprobate only. Epistemon What more is the rest troubled of a dead body, when the Devil car­ries it out of the grave to serve his turn for a space, than when the witches take it up and disjoint it, or when swine root up the graves? The rest, of them that the Scripture speaks of, is not meant by a local remaining continually in one place, but by their resting from their travails and miseries of this world, until their latter conjunction again with the soul, at that time to receive full glory in both. And that the Devil may use as well the ministry of the bodies of the faithful in these cases, as of the unfaithful, there is no inconve­nience; for his hauntings with their bodies after they are dead can nowise defile them, in respect of the soul's absence. And for any dis­honor it can be unto them, by what reason can it be greater than the hanging, beheading, or many such shameful deaths that good men will suffer?

Philomathes Yet there are some that affirm to have haunted such places, where these spirits are alleged to be, and could never hear nor see anything. Epistemon I think well: for that is only reserved to the secret knowledge of God, whom he will permit to see such things and whom not. Philomathes But where these spirits haunt and trouble any houses, what is the best way to banish them? Epistemon By two means may only the remedy of such thing be procured. The one is ardent prayer to God, both of these persons that are troubled with them, and of that church whereof they are. The other is the purging of themselves by amendment of life from such sins, as have procured that extraordinary plague. Philomathes And what means then these kinds of spirits, when they appear as the shade of a person newly dead, or to die, to his friends? Epistemon When they appear upon that occasion, they are called wraiths in our language. Among the pagans the Devil used that much, to make them believe that it was some good spirit that appeared to them then, either to forewarn them of the death of their friend, or else to discover unto them the will of the deceased, or what was the way of his slaughter, as is written in the book of the Histories Prodigious.

For he dare not so delude any that know that neither can the spirit of the deceased return to his friend, or ye t an angel use such forms. Philomathes And are not our werewolves one sort of these spirits also, that haunt and trouble some houses or dwelling places? Epistemon There has indeed been an old opinion of such like things; for by the Greeks they were called lukanthropoi, which signifies man-wolves.6 But to tell you simply my opinion in this, if any such thing has been, I take it to have proceeded but of a natural superabundance of mel­ancholy, which as we read, that it has made some think themselves pitchers, and some horses, and some one kind of beast or other. So suppose I that it has so vitiated the imagination and memory of some, as per Iucida interualla/ it has so highly occupied them, that they have thought themselves very wolves indeed at times, and so have counterfeited their actions in going on their hands and feet, pressing to devour women and children, fighting and snatching with all the town dogs, and in using suchlike other brutish actions, and so to become beasts by a strong apprehension, as Nebuchadnezzar was seven years (Daniel4).8 But as to their having and hiding of their hard and shelly sloughs, I take that to be but learned by uncertain report, the author of all lies. NOTES TO BOOK III, CHAPTER I Note 1: Lemures, or ghosts of the dead, were sometimes divided into two classes by the Romans-lares , the ghosts of good men, and larvae, the ghosts of evil men.

By night they fly, and they seek the children unprotected by the nurse, and pollute their bodies, dragged from their cradles. With their beaks they are said to tear the entrails of the sucklings, and they have their maws distended with the blood which they have swallowed\" (Ovid, Fasti, page 216). This is evidently the same sort of winged night spirit that was fabled to visit Jewish children and stop their breath . It was identified by Kabbalists with Lilith, originally a Bab­ylonian demoness who was elevated by Jewish Kabbalists to the rank of queen of hell. Both spirits may have their o rigin in the phenomenon known as crib death, or sudden infant death syn­drome. A small percentage of very young children, for no appar­ent reason, simply stop breathing in the middle of the night and die. Note 5: The spirits called in Hebrew ZIIM and liM are mentioned in the notes of the King James Bible. Both are translated simply as \"wild beasts,\" the ZIIM as the \" wild beasts of the desert\" (Isaiah 13:21) and liM as the \"wild beasts of the islands\" (Isaiah 13:22). Gesenius identifies TziiM (CJ���) as \"dwellers in the desert,\" in this case wild animals such as the jackal and ostrich, although the term was also applied to desert nomads (Gesenius, Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon, page 708). Note 6: The word \"lycanthrope\" is from the Greek ADKav9pwnocr -ADKOCJ: a wolf; avepwnocr: a man. Summers quotes Richard Rowlands, who in 1605 wrote on the topic: \"The were-wolves are certaine sorcerers, who hauing annoynted their bodyes, with an oyntment which they make by the instinct of the deuil; and put­ting on a certaine inchanted gridel, do not only vnto the view of others seeme as wolues, but to their own thinking haue both the shape and nature of wolues, so long as they weare the said girdel."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 155 Figure 10 And they do dispose themselues as very wolues, in wurrying and killing, and moste of humaine creatures\" (Summers, The We re­wolf, page 3) . The account of the murders committed by Peter Stumpp in Germany, who was executed for his crimes in 1589, shows that the belief in werewolves was still very much alive at the time the North Berwick witches were supposed to be seeking the deaths of James and Anne, and that it was inextricably mingled with a belief in the power of sorcery and malice of the Devil. A year after Stumpp's execution, a tract was published in London detail­ing his activities. Contained in it is the following account of how Stumpp, called in the tract Stubbe Peeter, became a werewolf: The Devil, who saw him a fit instrument to perform mis­chief as a wicked fiend pleased with the desire of wrong and destruction, gave unto him a girdle which, being put around him, he was straight transformed into the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like unto brands of fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK and mighty paws.

Epistemon As to the next two kinds, that is, either these that outwardly trouble and follow some persons, or else inwardly possess them: I will con­join them in one, because as well the causes are alike in the persons they are permitted to trouble, as also the ways whereby they may be remedied and cured. Philomathes What kind of persons are they that are used to being so troubled? Epistemon Two kinds especially: either such as being guilty of grievous offences, God punishes by that horrible kind of scourge, or else being persons of the best nature peradventure , that you shall find in all the country about them, God permits them to be troubled in that sort, for the trial of their patience, and wakening up of their zeal, for admonishing of the beholders not to trust overmuch in themselves, 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK since they are made of no better stuff, and peradventure blotted with no smaller sins (as Christ said, speaking of them upon whom the tower in Siloam fell (Luke 13)); and for giving likewise to the spectators, matter to praise God, that they meriting no better, are yet spared from being corrected in that fearful form. Philomathes These are good reasons for the part of God, which apparently moves him so to permit the Devil to trouble such persons. But since the Devil has ever a contrary respect in all the actions that God employs him in, which is, I pray you, the end and mark he shoots at in this turn? Epistemon It is to obtain one of two things thereby, if he may. The one is the tinsel of their life, by inducing them to such perilous places at such times as he either follows or possesses them, which may procure the same: and such like, so far as God will permit him, by tormenting them to weaken their bodies, and cast them into incurable diseases. The other thing that he wishes to obtain by troubling of them, is the tinsel of their soul, by enticing them to mistrust and blaspheme God, either for the intolerableness of their torments, as he assayed to have done with job (Job 10), or else for his promising unto them to leave the troubling of them, in case they would so do, as is known by experience at this same time by the confession of a young one that was so troubled. Philomathes Since you have spoken now of both these kinds of spirits, compre­hending them in one, I must now go back again in casting some questions of every one of these kinds in particular. And first for these that follow certain persons, you know that there are two sorts of them: one sort that troubles and torments the persons that they haunt with, and another sort that are serviceable unto them in all"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 159 kinds of their necessities, and omit neve r to forewarn them of any sudden peril that they are to be in. And so in this case, I would under­stand whether both these sorts be but wicked and damned spirits, or if the last sort be rather angels (as should appear by their actions) sent by God to assist such as he specially favors. For it is written in the Scriptures, that God sends legions of angels to guard and watch over his elect (Genesis 32; I Kings 6; Psalms 34). Epistemon I know well enough wherefrom that error which you allege has pro­ceeded: for it was the ignorant pagans that were the fountain there of. Who for that they knew not God, they forged in their own imagina­tions, every man to be still accompanied with two spirits, whereof they called the one genius bonus, the other genius malus.1 The Greeks called them endaimona and kakodaimona, whereof the former they said, persuaded him to all the good he did, the other enticed him to all the evil. But praised be God we that are Christians, and walk not among the Cimmerian2 conjectures of man, know well enough that it is the good spirit of God only, who is the fountain of all goodness, that persuades us to the thinking or doing of any good; and that it is our corrupted flesh and Satan that entice us to the contrary. And yet the Devil for confirming in the heads of ignorant Christians, that error first maintained among the pagans, he bides among the first kind of spirits that I speak of, appeared in time of Papistry and blind­ness, and haunted diverse houses, without doing any evil, but doing as it were necessary tasks up and down the house: and this spirit they called brownie3 in our language, who appeared like a rough man; yea, some were so blinded, as to believe that their house was all the more prosperous, as they called it, that such spirits resorted there.

Where now the church being established, and the white horse5 whereof I spoke before, having made his con­quest, the law and prophets are thought sufficient to serve us, or make us inexcusable, as Christ says in his parable of Lazarus and the rich man (Luke 16).

It is from this ancient pagan belief that we get the Christian fable that everyone has a angel on their right shoulder and a devil on their left shoulder, forever whispering suggestions into their ears.

And what is the reason wherefo re these kinds of spirits haunt most the northern and barbarous parts of the world. Philomathes The next question that I would speak, is likewise concerning this first of these two kinds of spirits that you have conjoined, and it is this: you know how it is commonly written and reported, that among the rest of the sorts of spirits that follow certain persons, there is one more monstrous than all the rest, in respect as it is alleged they have intercourse naturally with them whom they trouble and haunt with? And therefore I would know in two things your opinion herein: first, if such a thing can be; and next, if it be, whether there be a differ­ence of sexes among these spirits, or not. Epistemon That abominable kind of the Devil's abusing of men or women was called of old incubi and succubi, according to the difference of the sexes that they had congress with. 1 By two means this great kind of abuse might possibly be performed. The one, when the Devil only as a spirit, and stealing out the sperm of a dead body, abuses them that way, they not clearly seeing any shape or feeling any thing, but that which he so conveys in that part: as we read of a monastery of nuns"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"164 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK which were burnt for their being that way abused. The other means it when h e borrows a dead body and so visibly, and as it seems unto them naturally, as a man copulates with them. But it is to be noted, that in whatsoever way he uses it, that sperm seems intolerably cold to the person abused. For if he steals out the nature of a living person, it cannot be so quickly carried, but it will both lose the strength and heat by the way, which it could never have had for lack of agitation, which in the time of procreation is the pro­curer and wakener up of these two natural qualities. And if he oc­cupying the dead body as his lodging, expel the same out thereof in the due time, it must likewise be cold by the participation with the qualities of the dead body whereout of it comes. And whereas you inquire if these spirits be divided in sexes or not, I think the rules of philosophy may easily resolve a man of the contrary: for it is a sure principle of that art, that nothing can be di­vided in sexes, except such living bodies as must have a natural seed to generate by. But we know spirits have no seed proper to them­selves, nor yet can they engender one with another. Philomathes How is it then that they say various monsters have been gotten by that way? Epistemon These tales are nothing but aniles fa bulae.2 For that they have no semen of their own, I have shown you already. And that the cold semen of a dead body can work nothing in generation, it is more than plain, as being already dead of itself as well as the rest of the body is, wanting the natural heat, and such other natural operations, as are necessary for working that effect. And in case such a thing were possible (which were all utterly against all rules of nature), it would breed no monster, but only such a natural offspring as would have come between that man or woman and that other abused per­son, in case they both being alive had had ado with [each] other."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 165 For the Devil's part therein is but the naked carrying or expelling of that substance, and so it could not participate with no quality of the same. Indeed, it is possible to the craft of the Devil to make a woman's belly to swel l after he hath that way abused her, which he may do either by stirring up her own humor, or by herbs, as we see beggars daily do;1 and when the time of her delivery should come to make her labor with great anguish, l ike unto that natural course, and then subtly to slip into the midwife's hands sticks, stones, or some monstrous child brought from some other place. But this is more reported and guessed at by others, than believed by me. Philomathes But what is the cause that this kind of abuse is thought to be most common in such wild parts of the world, as Lapland and Finland,4 or in our north isles of Orkney and Shetland? Epistemon Because where the Devil finds greatest ignorance and barbarity, there assails he most grossly, as I gave you the reason wherefore there were more witches of womenkind than men. Philomathes Can any be so unhappy as to give their willing consent to the Devil's vile abusing them in this form? Epistemon Yea, some of the witches have confessed that he has persuaded them to give their willing consent thereunto, that he may thereby have them tangled the deeper in his snares; but as the other compelled sort is to be pitied and prayed for, so is this most highly to be pun­ished and detested.

It was be­lieved by many demonologists that this appearance of gender was not an essential part of the nature of these spirits, but that they could change from male to female at will, depending on the sex of the person with whom they intended to have intercourse. How spirits copulated with humans, whether they stole human semen to inject into the womb during these unions, and whether it was possible that such lovemaking could result in pregnancy, were all topics of hot debate. However, there was general agreement that the incidence of willing sexual union with spirits had increased in recent times. But the theory that modern witches are tainted with this sort of diabolical filthiness is not substantiated only in our opin­ion, since the expert testimony of the witches themselves has made all these things credible; and that they do not now, as in times past, subject themselves unwillingly, but willingly em­brace this most foul and miserable servitude. For how many women have we left to be punished by secular law in various di­oceses, especially in Constance and the town of Ratisbon, who have been for many years addicted to these abominations, some from their twentieth and some from their twelfth or thirteenth year, and always with a total or partial abnegation of the Faith?"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 167 All the inhabitants of these places are witnesses of it.

Sometimes there is a sensation of the weight shifting, as though whatever causes it we re moving around. This sensation of weight is accompanied by an inability to move the limbs that must be consciously and willfully thrown off.

Epistemon As to your first question, there are diverse symptoms whereby that heavy trouble may be discerned from a natural sickness, and spe­cially three, omitting the diverse vain signs that the Papists attribute unto it, such as the raging at holy water, their fleeing aback from the cross, their not abiding the hearing of God named, and innumerable such like vain things that were alike tiresome and worthless to recite. But to come to these three symptoms then, whereof I spoke , I ac­count the one of them to be the incredible strength of the possessed"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"170 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK creature , which will far exceed the strength of six of the stoutest and strongest of any other men that are not so troubled.' The next is the rising up so far of the patient's breast and belly, with such an un­natural stirring and vehement agitation with them, and such an iron hardness of his sinews so stiffly bended out, that it were not pos­sible to prick out, as it were , the skin o f any other person so far: so mightily works the Devil in all the members and senses of his body, he being locally within the same; although of his soul and affections thereof, he has no more power than over any other man's. The last is the speaking of different languages, which the patient is known by them that we re acquainted with him never to have learned, and that with an uncouth and hollow voice, and all the time of his speaking, a greater motion being in his breast than in his mouth.2 But from this last symptom is excepted such as are altogether, in the time of their possessing, bereft of all their senses, being possessed with a dumb and blind spirit, whereof Christ relieved one, in the twelfth chapter of Matthew. And as to your next demand, it is first to be doubted if the Papists or any not professing the only true religion, can relieve any of that trouble. And next, in case they can, upon what respects it is possible unto them. As to the former, upon two reasons it is grounded. First, that it is known so many of them to be counterfeit, which deception the clergy invents for confirming of their rotten religion. The next is, that by experience we find that few who are possessed indeed are fully cured by them: but rather the Devil is content to release the bodily hurting of them, for a short space, thereby to obtain the per­petual hurt of the souls of so many that by these false miracles may be induced or confirmed in the profession of that erroneous reli­gion: even as I told you before that he does in the false cures, or cast­ing off of diseases by witches. As to the other part of the argument, in case they can, which rather (with reverence of the learned thinking otherwise) I am in­duced to believe, by reason o f the faithful report that men sound of"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK 171 religion have made according to their sight thereof, I think if so be, I say these may be the respects whereupon the Papists may have that power. Christ gave a commission and power to his apostles to cast out devils, which they accordingly thereunto put into execution. The rules he had them observe in that action were fasting and prayer, and the action itself [was] to be done in his name. This power of theirs proceeded not, then, of any virtue in them, but only in him who directed them. As was clearly proved by judas, his having as great power in that commission as any of the rest. It is easy, then, to be understood that the casting out of devils is by the virtue of fasting and prayer, and invoking of the name of God, even though many imperfections be in the person that is the instrument, as Christ him­self teaches us of the power that false prophets shall have to cast out devils (Matthew 7). It is no wonder, then, these respects of this ac­tion being considered, that it may be possible to the Papists, though erring in various points of religion, to accomplish this, if they use the right form prescribed by Christ herein. For what the worse is that action, that they err in other things , more than their baptism is the worse that they err in the other sacrament, and have added many vain freits to the baptism itself. Philomathes Surely it is no little wonder that God should permit the bodies of any of the faithful to be so dishonored, as to be a dwelling place to that unclean spirit. Epistemon There is it which I told right now, would prove and strengthen my argument of the Devil's entering in the dead bodies of the faithful. For if he is permitted to enter in their living bodies, even when they are joined with the soul, how much more will God permit him to enter in their dead carcasses, which is no more man, but the filthy and corruptible case of man.

NOTES ON BOOK III, CHAPTER I V Note 1: James was himself the witness of a case of possession on Christmas Eve, 1590, during the interrogation of John Fian. It is described in News From Scotland. Fian confessed to having be­witched a man so that for one hour every day he fell into a raving fit. It seems likely that Pian was aware of this man's bizarre men­tal illness, which was probably well-known in the area where he lived, and in an attempt to avoid more torture , Fian confessed to having caused the fits through witchcraft. james had the man brought before him in the King's chamber, and watched the possession happen. Suddenly the man gave a screech and began to bend his body and caper about and spring up so that his head touched the ceiling of the room. Those with James who were watching this Christmas entertainment tried to hold the man down, but he was too strong for them. More at­tendants had to be called in so that he could be tied up until his fit passed. When he came to his senses, James asked him what awareness he retained of his actio ns, and the man told him that he had been asleep. Note 2: In Greek and Roman times, those from whom issued the voices of spirits were known as belly-speakers, or ventriloquists (venter: \"belly,\"' loquor: \"to speak\"). They were characterized in this way because the voices of the spirits did not seem to come from the mouths of the possessed individuals, but from their abdom­inal regions.

Epistemon That fourth kind of spirits, which by the pagans was called Diana and her wandering court, 1 and among us was called the fairies (as I told you), or our Good Neighbours/ was one of the sorts of illu­sions that was rifest in the time of Papistry. For although it was held odious to prophesy by the Devil , yet whom this kind of spirits car­ried away and informed, they were thought to be luckiest and of best life. To speak of the many vain prattles founded upon that illu­sion, how there was a king and queen of fairy, of such a jolly court and train as they had, how they had a tithe and duty, as it were, of all goods, how they naturally rode and went, ate and drank, and did all other actions like natural men and women, I think it more like Virgil's Campi Elysii, 3 than anything that ought to be believed by Christians, except in general, that as I spoke various times before, the Devil deludes the senses of many simple creatures, in making them believe that they saw and heard such things as were nothing so indeed. 173"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Philomathes 174 DEMONOLOGY: THE THIRD BOOK But how can it be then, that many witches have gone to death with that confession, that they have been transported with the fairies to such a hill, 4 which opening, they went in, and there saw a fairy queen, who being now lighter, gave them a stone5 that had various virtues, which at different times has been produced in judgement? Epistemon I say that, even as I said before of that imaginary ravishing of the spirit forth of the body. For may not the Devil present to their fan­tasy, their senses being dulled, and as it were asleep, such hills and houses within them, such glistening courts and trains, and what­soeve r such like wherewith he pleases to delude them? And in the meantime, their bodies b eing senseless, to convey into their hands any stone or such like thing, which he makes them to imagine to have received in such a place. Philomathes But what say you to their foretelling the death of various persons, whom they allege to have seen in these places? That is a sooth-dream (as they say) since they see it walking. Epistemon I think that either they have not been sharply enough examined, that gave so blunt a reason for their prophecy, or otherwise, I think it likewise as possible that the Devil may prophesy to them when he deceives their imaginations in that sort, as well as when he plainly speaks unto them at other times; for their prophesying is but a kind of vision, as it were , wherein he commonly counterfeits God among the pagans, as I told you before.

But as the one sort, for being perforce troubled with them ought to be pitied, so ought the other sort (who may be discerned by their taking upon them to prophesy by them), that sort I say, ought as severely to be punished as any other witches, and rather the more , in that they go dissemblingly to work. Philomathes And what makes the spirits have so different names from others? Epistemon Even the knavery of that same Devil, who as he deludes the necro­mancers with innumerable feigned names for him and his angels, as in particular making Satan, Beelzebub, and Lucifer to be three different spirits, where we find the two former but different names given to the prince of all the rebelling angels by the Scripture . As by Christ, the prince of all the devils is called Beelzebub in that place which I alleged against the power of any heretics to cast out devils. By john in the Revelation, the old tempter is called Satan, the prince of all the evil angels. And last, to wit, Lucifer is but by allegory taken from the Day Star7 (so named in diverse places of the Scripture s) because of his excellence (I mean the prince of them) in his creation before his fall . Even so I say he deceives the witches by attributing to himself diverse names, as if every different shape that he transforms himself into were a different kind of spirit.

For because the ground of this conference of ours proceeded of your inquiring at me at our meeting, if there were such a thing as witches or spirits, and if they had any power, I therefore have framed my whole discourse only to prove that such things are and may be, by such number of examples as I show to be possible by reason, and keep myself from dipping any further in playing the part of a dic­tionary, to tell whatever I have read or heard in that purpose, which both would exceed faith, and rather would seem to teach such unlawful arts, not to disallow and condemn them, as it is the duty of all Christians to do. NOTES ON BOOK III, CHAPTER V Note 1: Summers quotes from the work De ecclesiasticis disciplinis of the Abbot Regina of Priim, written in 906: This too must by no means be passed over that certain ut­terly abandoned women, turning aside to fo llow Satan, being seduced by the illusions and phantasmical shows of demons firmly believe and openly profess that in the dead of night they ride upon certain beasts along with the pagan goddess Diana and a countless horde of women, and that in those silent hours they fly over vast tracts of country and obey her as their mis­tress, whilst on certain other nights they are summoned to do her homage and pay her service (Summers, The History of Wi tchcraft and Demonology, page 121). Note 2: Fairies were sometimes referred to as \"the good folk\" as a form of avertive magic, to propitiate them and turn aside their wrath. It is exactly the same impulse of human nature that caused the Greeks to refer to the Furies, who originally were named the Erinyes (Angry Ones) as the Eumenides (Gracious Ones).

The fairies were thought to dwell in the depths of these hills in hidden cav­erns and passageways. Those who climbed the hill might chance to see the fairies dancing in a ring on the grass. If they inadver­tently offended the good people, for example by refusing an offer of hospitality, they might find themselves suddenly swept under the hill and unable to escape. Entire palaces were said to be be­neath these hills.

Philomathes Whether may the prince, then, or supreme magistrate, spare or overlook any that are guilty of that craft, upon some great respects known to him? Epistemon The prince or magistrate for further trials' cause, may delay the pun­ishing of them such a certain space as he thinks convenient: but in the end, to spare the life, and not to strike when God b ids strike, and so severely punish in so odious a fault and treason against God, it is not only unlawful, but doubtless no less sin in that magistrate than it was in Saul's sparing of Agag (I Samuel15).

Epistemon Judges ought indeed to beware whom they condemn, for it is as great a crime (as Solomon says) to condemn the innocent, as to let the guilty escape free (Proverbs 17); neither ought the report of any one infamous person be admitted for a sufficient proof, which can stand of no law. Philomathes And what may a number then of guilty persons' confessions work against one that is accused? Epistemon The assize must serve fo r interpreter of our law in that respect. But in my opinion, since in a matter of treason against the prince, chil­dren or wives or never so defamed persons may of our law serve for sufficient witnesses and proofs, I think surely that by a far greater re ason, such witnesses may be sufficient in matters of high treason against God. For who but witches can be proofs, and so witnesses, of the doings of witches? Philomathes Indeed, I trust they will be loath to prosecute any honest man upon their counsel. But what if they accuse folk to have been present at their imaginary conventions in the spirit, when their bodies lie sense­less, as you have said?

Philomathes Then Samuel was a witch: fo r the Devil resembled his shape, and played his person, in giving response to Saul. Epistemon Samuel was dead as well before that, and so none could slander him with meddling in that unlawful art. For the cause why, as I take it, that God will not permit Satan to use the shapes or similitudes of any innocent person at such unlawful times, is that God will not permit that any innocent person shall be slandered with that vile defection. 2 For then the Devil would find ways anew to calumniate the best. And this we have in proof by them that are carried with the fa iries, who neve r see the shades of any in that court, but of them that thereafter are tried fo r having been brethren and sisters of that craft. And this was likewise proved by the confession of a young lass, troubled with spirits, laid on her by witchcraft. That although she saw the shapes of diverse men and women troubling her, and named the persons whom these shades represented, yet never one of them was fo und to be innocent, but all clearly tried to be most guilty, and the most part of them confessed the same. And besides that, I think it has been seldom heard tell of, that any whom persons guilty of that crime accused, as having known them to be their companions by eyesight, and not by hearsay, but such as were so accused of witchcraft could not be clearly tried upon them, were at the least publicly known to be of a very evil life and reputation: so jealous is God I say, of the fa me of them that are in­nocent in such causes. And besides that, there are two other good helps that may be used fo r their trial. The one is the fi nding of their mark, and the trying of the insensibleness thereof.

And to conclude then, since I am to take my leave of you, I pray God to purge this country of these devilish practices: fo r they were never so rife in these parts, as they are now. Epistemon I pray God that so be, too. But the causes are over manifest, that makes them to be so rife. For the great wickedness of the people on the one part, procures this horrible defection, whereby God justly punishes sin, by a greater iniquity; and on the other part, the con­summation of the world, and our deliverance drawing near, makes Satan to rage the more in his instruments, knowing his kingdom to be so near an end (Revelation 2).

Within the town of Tranent2 in the kingdom of Scotland, there dwells one David Seaton,3 who being deputy-bailiff in the said town, had a maid servant called Gilly Duncan, who used secretly to be ab­sent and to lie forth of her master's house every other night.

Whereupon, her master began to grow very inquisitive, and ex­amined her which way and by what means she was able to perform matters of so great importance. Whereat, she gave no answer. Nev­ertheless, her master, to the intent that he might the better try and find out the truth of the same, did with the help of others, torment her with the torture of the pilliwinks4 upon her fingers, which is a grievous torture, and binding or wrenching her head with a cord or rope,5 which is a most cruel torment also. Yet would she not confess anything. Whereupon they, suspecting that she had been marked by the Devil (as commonly witches are), made dilligent search about her, and found the Enemy's mark to be in her forecrag, or forepart of her throat.

And foreasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft and witches in Scotland, it has lately been found that the Devil does gen­erally mark them with a private mark, by reason the witches have confessed themselves, that the Devil does lick them with his tongue in some private part of their body, before he does receive them to be his servants, which mark commonly is given them under the hair in some part of their body, whereby it may not easily be found out"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 193 or seen, although they be searched. And generally, so long as the mark is not seen to those which search them, so long the parties that have the mark will never confess anything. Therefore by special commandment this Agnes Sampson had all her hair shaved off, in each part of her body, and her head thrawn with a rope according to the custom of that country, being a pain most grievous, which she continued almost an hour, during which time she would not confess anything until the Devil's mark was found upon her privates. Then she immediately confessed whatsoever was demanded of her, and testified those persons aforesaid to be notorious witches. Item, the said Agnes Sampson was afterwards brought again be­fore the King's Majesty and his Council, and being examined of the meetings and detestable dealings of these witches, she confessed that upon the night of All Hallows' Eve last, she was accompanied as well with the persons aforesaid, as also with a great many other witches, to the number of two hundred, 11 and that all they together went by sea each one in a riddle or sieve, 12 and went in the same very substantially with flaggons of wine, making merry and drinking by the way in the same riddles or sieves, to the kirk13 of North Berwick in Lothian, and that after they had landed, took hands on the land and danced this reel, or short dance, singing all with one voice. Comer go ye before, comer go ye, If ye will not go before, comer let me. At which time she confessed, that this Gilly Duncan did go before them playing this reel or dance upon a small trump, called a Jew's trump, 14 until they entered into the kirk of North Berwick.1 5 These confessions made the King in a wonderful admiration, and [he] sent for the said Gilly Duncan, who upon the like trump did play the said dance before the King's Majesty, who in respect of the strangeness of these matters took great delight to be present at their examinations."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"194 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND Item, the said Agnes Sampson confessed that the Devil being then at North Berwick Kirk, attending their coming in the habit or likeness of a man, 16 and seeing that they tarried overlong, he at their coming enjoined them all to a pennance, which was, that they should kiss his buttocks, in sign of duty to him: which being put over the pulpit bar, everyone did as he had enjoined them. And hav­ing made his ungodly exhortations, wherein he did greatly inveigh against the King of Scotland, he received their oaths for their good and true service towards him, and departed. Which done, they re­turned to sea, and so home again. At which time the witches demanded of the Devil why he did bear such hatred to the King, who answered, by reason the King is the greatest enemy he hath in the world: all which their confessions and depositions are still extant upon record. Item, the said Agnes Sampson confessed before the King's Maj­esty various things which were so miraculous and strange, as that his Majesty said they were all extreme liars, whereat she answered, she would not wish his Majesty to suppose her words to be false, but rather to believe them, in that she would discover such matter unto him as his Majesty should not any way doubt of. And thereupon taking his Majesty a little aside, she declared unto him the very words which passed between the King's Majesty and his Queen at Oslo in Norway the first night of their marriage, 17 with their answer each to other. Whereat the King's Majesty won­dered greatly, and swore by the living God, that he believed that all the devils in hell could not have discovered the same, acknowledging her words to be most true, and therefore gave the more credit to the rest which is before declared. Touching this Agnes Sampson, she is the same woman who by the Devil's persuasion should have intended and put in execution the King Majesty's death, in this manner. She confessed that she took a black toad, and did hang the same up by the heels three days, and collected and gathered the venom"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 195 as it dropped and fell from it into an oyster shell, and kept the same venom close covered, until she should obtain any part or piece of fouled linen cloth, that had appertained to the King's Majesty, as shirt, handkerchief, napkin, or any other thing, which she practiced to obtain by means of one john Kers, who being attendant in his Majesty's chamber, desired him for old acquaintance between them, to help her to one or a piece of such a cloth as is aforesaid. Which thing the said john Kers denied to help her to, saying he could not help her to it. And the said Agnes Sampson, by her dispositions since her apprehension, said that if she had obtained any one piece of linen cloth which the King had worn and fouled, she had bewitched him to death, and put him to such extraordinary pains, as if he had been lying upon sharp thorns and ends of needles. Moreover, she confessed that at the time when his Majesty was in Denmark, she being accompanied with the parties before specially named, took a cat and christened it, 1 8 and afterward bound to each part of that cat, the chiefest parts19 of a dead man, and several joints of his body,20 and that in the night following, the said cat was conveyed into the midst of the sea by all these witches sailing in their riddles or sieves as is aforesaid, and so left the said cat right before the town of Leith in Scotland. This done, there did arise such a tempest in the sea, as a greater hath not been seen, which tempest was the cause of the perishing of a boat or vessel coming over from the town of Burntis­land to the town of Leith, wherein were many jewels and rich gifts, which should have been presented to the new Queen of Scotland, at her Majesty's coming to Leith. Again it is confessed, that the said christened cat was the cause that the King's Majesty's ship at his coming forth from Denmark had a contrary wind to the rest of his ships, then being in his company, which thing was most strange and true, as the King's Majesty acknowledged, for when the rest of the ships had a fair and good wind, then was the wind contrary and altogether against his Majesty."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"196 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND And further the said witch declared, that his Majesty had never come safely from the sea, if his faith had not prevailed above their intentions. Moreover, the said witches being demanded how the Devil would use them when he was in their company, they confessed that when the Devil did receive them for his servants, and that they had vowed themselves unto him, then he would carnally use them, albeit to their little pleasure , in respect of his cold nature :21 and would do the like at various other times. As touching the aforesaid Doctor Fian, alias John Cunningham, the examination of his acts since his apprehension declares the great subtlety of the Devil, and therefore makes things to appear the more miraculous: for being apprehended by the accusation of the said Gilly Duncan aforesaid, who confessed he was their Register,22 and that there was not one man suffered to come to the Devil's re adings but only he,23 the said doctor was taken and imprisoned, and used with the accustomed pain provided for those offenses, inflicted upon the rest as is aforesaid. First, by wringing of his head with a rope, whereat he would confess nothing. Secondly, he was persuaded by fair means to confess his follies, but that would prevail as little. Lastly, he was put to the most severe and cruel pain in the world, called the boots, 24 which after he had received three strokes, being enquired if he would confess his damnable acts and wicked life, his tongue would not serve him to speak, in respect whereof the rest of the witches willed to search his tongue, under which was found two pins thrust up into the head, whereupon the witches did chant, now is the charm stinted, and showed that those charmed pins were the cause he could not confess anything. Then he was immediately released of the boots, brought before the King, his confession was taken, and his own hand willingly set thereunto, which contained as follows."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"NEWS I'IWM SCOTLAND 197 Figure 16 First, that at the general meetings of those witches, he was al­ways present; that he was clerk to all those that were in subjection to the Devil's service, bearing the name of witches; that always he did take their oaths for their true service to the Devil; and that he wrote fo r them such matters as the Devil still pleased to command him. Item, he confessed that by his witchcraft he did bewitch a gentle­man dwelling near to the Saltpans, where the said doctor kept school, only for being enamoured of a gentlewoman whom he loved himself, by means of which his sorcery, witchcraft, and devilish practices, he caused the said gentleman that once in twenty-four hours he fe ll into a lunacy and madness, and so continued one whole hour together. And for the proving of the same, he caused the gentleman to be brought before the King's Majesty, which was upon the twenty-fourth day of December last2' And being in his Majesty's chamber, suddenly he gave a great screech and fe ll into a madness, sometimes bending himself, and sometimes capering so directly up, that his head did touch the ceil­ing of the chamber, to the great admiration of his Majesty and others"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"198 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND then present, so that all the gentlemen in the chamber were not able to hold him, until they called in more help, who together bound him hand and foot. And suffering the said gentleman to lie still until his fury was past, he within an hour came again to himself; when being demanded of the King's Majesty what he saw or did all that while, an­swered that he had been in a sound sleep. Item, the said doctor did also confess that he had used means at various times to obtain his purpose and wicked intent of the same gentlewoman, and seeing himself disappointed of his intention, he determined by all ways he might to obtain the same, trusting by conjuring, witchcraft, and sorcery to obtain it in this manner. It happened this gentlewoman being unmarried, had a brother who went to school with the said doctor, who calling his scholar to him, demanded if he did lie with his sister, who answered he did. By means whereof he thought to obtain his purpose, and therefore se­cretly promised to teach him without stripes, so he would obtain for him three hairs of his sister's privates, at such time as he should spy best occasion for it. Which the youth promised faithfully to perform, and vowed speedily to put it in practice, taking a piece of conjured paper of his master to wrap them in when he had gotten them. And thereupon the boy practiced nightly to obtain his master's purpose, especially when his sister was asleep. But God, who knoweth the secrets of all hearts, and revealeth all wicked and ungodly practices, would not suffer the intents of this devilish doctor to come to that purpose which he supposed it would, and therefore to declare that he was heavily offended with his wicked intent, did so work by the gentlewoman's own means, that in the end the same was discovered and brought to light. For she being one night asleep, and her brother in bed with her, sud­denly cried out to her mother, declaring that her brother would not suffer her to sleep, whereupon her mother having a quick capacity, did vehemently suspect Doctor Pian's intention, by reason she was a witch of herself, and therefore presently arose, and was very inquisi­tive of the boy to understand his intent, and the better to know the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 199 same, did beat him with many stripes, whereby he discovered the truth unto her. The mother therefore being well practiced in witchcraft, did think it most convenient to meet with the doctor in his own art, and thereupon took the paper from the boy, wherein he should have put the same hairs, and went to a young heifer which never had born calf nor gone to the bull, and with a pair of shears, clipped off three hairs from the udder of the cow, and wrapped them in the same paper, which she again delivered to the boy, then willing him to give the same to his said master, which he immediately did. The schoolmaster so soon as he had received them, thinking them indeed to be the maid's hairs, went straight and wrought his art upon them. But the doctor had no sooner done his intent to them, but presently the heifer or cow whose hairs they were in­deed, came unto the door of the church wherein the school master was, into which the heifer went, and made towards the schoolmas­ter, leaping and dancing upon him, and following him forth of the church and to what place soeve r he went, to the great admiration of all the townsmen of Saltpans, and many others who did behold the same. 26 The report whereof made all men imagine that he did work it by the Devil, without whom it could never have been so sufficiently ef­fected. And thereupon, the name of the said Doctor Fian (who was but a very young man) began to grow so common among the people of Scotland, that he was secretly nominated for a notable conjurer. All which although in the beginning he denied, and would not confess, yet having felt the pain of the boots (and the charm stinted, as aforesaid), he confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, without producing any witnesses to justify the same, and thereupon before the King' s Majesty he subscribed the said confessions with his own hand, which for truth remain upon record in Scotland. After that the depositions and examinations of the said Doctor Fian, alias Cunningham, we re taken, as already is declared, with his"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"200 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND Figure 17 own hand willingly set thereunto, he was by the master of the prison committed to ward, and appointed to a chamber by himself, where fo resaking his wicked ways, acknowledging his most ungodly life, showing that he h ad too much fo llowed the allurements and entice­ments of Satan, and fo ndly practiced his conclusions by conjuring, witchcraft, enchantment, sorcery, and such like, he re nounced the Devil and all his wicked works, vowed to lead the life of a Christian, and seemed newly connected towards God. The morrow after upon conference h ad with him, he granted that the Devil had appeared unto him in the night before , appar­eled all in black, with a white wand in his hand, and that the Devil demanded of him if he would continue his fa ithful service, accord­ing to his fi rst oath and promise made to that effect. Whom (as he then said) he utterly renounced to his fa ce, and said unto him in this manner, avoid Satan, avoid, fo r I have listened too much unto you,"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 201 and by the same you have undone me, in respect whereof I utterly foresake you. To whom the Devil answered, that once before you die you shall be mine. And with that (as he said) the Devil broke the white wand, and immediately vanished forth of his sight. Thus all the day this Doctor Fian continued very solitary, and seemed to have care of his own soul, and would call upon God, showing himself penitent for his wicked life. Nevertheless the same night he found such means, that he stole the key of the prison door and chamber in the which he was, which in the night he opened and fled away to the salt pans, where he was always resident, and first apprehended. Of whose sudden departure , when the King's Maj­esty had intelligence, he presently commanded diligent inquiry to be made for his apprehension, and for the better effecting there of, he sent public proclaimations into all parts of his land to the same effect. By means of whose hot and hard pursuit, he was again taken and brought to prison, and then being called before the King's High­ness, he was reexamined as well touching his departure, as also touching all that had before happened. But this doctor, notwithstanding that his own confession ap­peared remaining in the record under his own handwriting, and the same thereunto fixed in the presence of the King's Majesty and sev­eral of his Council, yet did he utterly deny the same. Whereupon the King' s Majesty perceiving his stubborn willful­ness, conceived and imagined that in the time of his absence he had entered into new conference and league with the Devil his Master, and that he had been again newly marked, for the which he was nar­rowly searched, but it could not in any way be found. Yet for more trial of him to make him confess, he was commanded to have a most strange torment, which was done in the manner following. His nails upon all his fingers were riven and pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish a turkas, which in England we call a pair of pincers, and under every nail there was thrust in two needles over even up to the heads. At all which torments notwithstanding"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"202 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND the doctor never shrank any wit, neither would he then confess it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted upon him. Then was he with all convenient speed, by commandment, con­veyed again to the torment of the boots, wherein he continued a long time, and did abide so many blows in them, that his legs were crushed and beaten together as small as might be, and the bones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spurted forth in great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable forever. And notwithstanding all these grievous pains and cruel torments, he would not confess anything, so deeply had the Devil entered into his heart, that he utterly denied all that which he had before avouched, and would say nothing thereupon but this, that what he had done and said before, was only done and said for fear of pains which he had endured. Upon great consideration therefore taken by the King' s Majesty and his Council, as well for the due execution of justice upon such detestable malefactors, as also for example's sake, to remain a terror to all others hereafter, that shall attempt to deal in the like wicked and ungodly actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, conjuration, and such like, the said Doctor Fian was soon after araigned, condemned, and adjudged by the law to die, and then to be burned according to the law of that land, provided in that behalf. Whereupon he was put into a cart, and being first strangled, he was immediately put into a great fire, being ready provided for that purpose, and there burned in the Castle Hill of Edinburgh on a Saturday in the end of January last past, 1591. The rest of the witches which are not yet executed, remain in prison till further trial, and knowledge of his Majesty's pleasure . This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps give some occasion of doubt to such as shall happen to read the same, and thereby conjecture that the King's Majesty would not hazard himself in the presence of such notorious witches, lest thereby might have ensured great danger to his per­son and the general state of the land, which thing in truth might well have"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 203 been feared. But to answer generally to such, let this suffice: that first it is well-known that the King is the child and servant of God, and they but ser­vants to the Devil; he is the Lord's annointed, and they but vessels of God's wrath; he is a true Christian, and trusts in God, they worse than infidels, fo r they only trust in the Devil, who daily serves them, till he has brought them to utter destruction. But hereby it seems that his Highness carried a magnanimous and un­daunted mind, not frightened with their enchantments, but resolute in this, that so long as God is with him, he ftars not who is against him. And truly the whole scope of this treatise does so plainly lay open the wonderful provi­dence of the Almighty, that if he had not been defended by his omnipotence and power, his Highness had never returned alive in his voyage from Den­mark, so that there is no doubt but God would as well defend him on the land as on the sea, where they pretended their damnable practice.

All were tortured, tried, and sentenced to death in 1591. By the ex­traordianry efforts of her family and friends, Barbara Napier avoided the fire. Agnes Sampson was strangled at the stake and her body burned on Castle Hill in Edinburgh, the usual manner and place of execution for convicted witches. Effie McCalyan was sentenced to be burned alive, perhaps because she refused t o im­plicate the Earl of Bothwell, but at the end she was afforded the mercy of strangulation before being consumed by the fire. john Fian faced unimaginably severe tortures, which he withstood as bravely as any man could have done, and maintaining his inno­cence to the end was executed by strangulation and burning. Not one of the witches was burned alive . Other key figures were Gilly Duncan, Richard Graham, Rob­ert Grierson, and Francis, Earl of Bothwell. Gilly Duncan was tried but does not appear to have been executed. Her life may have been spared in return for her accusations of witchcraft against her friends and neighbors, and her publi c repentence. Robert Grierson died in prison on April 15, 1591, probably as a result of the severity of his torture , although it is possible he took his own life. Richard Graham was executed in the usual fashion on February 29, 1592, on Castle Hill. Bothwell was tried on Au­gust 10, 1593, but was acquitted by a jury of his peers. However, he found it prudent to change his residence from Scotland to Italy. Lesser figures executed included Marion Ersche, Margaret Downey, Christian Todd, Begie Todd, Gilbert McGillis, john Mc­Gillis (Gilbert's son), john Gordon (known as Graymeal), Kather­ine Gray, Isabel Grierson, and Meg Dun.

A number of the accused managed to escape and flee to England, causing james to send the deputy-baliff of Tranent, David Seaton, who knew them all by sight, in pursuit. At least one of these witches was returned to Scotland by the English au­thorities for additional torture , and named additional names. Some of the names of those accused of witchcraft in the con­fessions of the witches, extracted from them by torture , are Mar­ion Linkup, Michael Clark, John Sibbet, Janet Duncan, George Matt, Meg Stillcart, Agnes Stratton, john Cooper, Bessie Gwlene, Archie Henill's wife (unnamed), Sir Robert Bowes (the English ambassador), David Nesbitt, and Arran Lord Farneyer. The spellings of the names of those involved in the affair are hopelessly corrupt in the documents of the period, and undoubt­edly there are instances when the same individual is mentioned under two different names as a result of this confusion. The most prominent instance in News From Scotland is where Agnes Sampson is referred to in several places as Agnes Tompson. I have corrected this duplication where it is unambiguous, and have at­tempted to modernize the names when a modern equivalent is"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"206 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND obvious. Margaret Thomson and Bessie Thomson may be the same person. The total numbers of persons executed, imprisoned, or tor­tured in the North Berwick affair are not known with certainty. According to the testimony of some of the accused, the num­ber of witches supposed to be present at their conventions, or sabbats, ranged from around seventy to two hundred, but those actually named were fewer in number. Margaret Murray, act­ing under the questonable assumption that there was organized witchcraft going on, put the number of witches at thirty-nine, or three covens of thirteen. This number seems arbitrary and is inaccurate, and in any case groups of witches did not always con­tain thirteen members. An examination of the names shows that family members were often accused together, husband and wife, sister and sister, mother and daughter, father and son. The scale of the human tragedy is considerably larger than what is con­firmed in the printed records. Note 2: David Seaton was not only instrumental in initiating the North Berwick witch affair, which he did when he questioned his maid, but must have been involved throughout the entire process of identifying and arresting the accused. We can make this sur­mise because, after a number of the accused fled to England at the beginning of Feburary, 1591, James was willing to pay Seaton to hunt them down and bring them back. The King prepared let­ters of introduction for Seaton to the English nobles Sir John Fos­ter, Sir Henry Woddrington, and Sir John Selby, instructing them to give Seaton every possible help in apprehending and confining the fugitives until they could be safely conveyed back to Scotland for trial. Seaton was also mentioned in the testimony of Agnes Sampson, who confessed that she had tried and failed to end Seaton's life with witchcraft. John Pian was accused of opening locks by magic in Seaton's house at Tranent, and also at the house of Seaton's mother."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 207 Note 3: Tranent is a small town about ten miles east of Edinburgh. Note 4: The pilliwinks was an instrument of torture similar to the thumbscrews, with which pressure was applied to the ends of the fingers by means of a screw to cause pain. Those who endured this type of torture reported that the blood would spurt from under the fingernails. By subjecting his maid to torture, Seaton was acting completely outside the authority of the law. However, at the end of the sixteenth century, it was common for the master of a household to physically discipline not only the members of his own family, but his servants as well. Seaton may have justified his actions on these grounds, although he greatly overstepped the bounds of custom. Note 5: This torture, called \"thrawing\" in the Scottish dialect, in­volved tightening a binding around the head by twisting a stic k through it, in a manner similar to that of a tourniquet. In this way strong pressure could be applied to the skull. Note 6: 'Agnes Tompson\" may merely be a misreading of the name 'Agnes Sampson.\" Note 7: Saltpans, sometimes referred to as the salt pans or Saltpres­ton, seems to be the place presently known as Prestonpans, lo­cated in East Lothian on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, about two miles northwest of Tranent. Note 8: Euphemia, or Effie, McCalyan, the daughter of Lord Clif­tonhall, was arraigned on June 9, 1591. She was the wife of Pat­rick Moscrop, a wealthy man, and was defended at her trial by six lawyers, but James was determined to see her dead, and dismissed the foreman of the jury in order to procure a verdict of guilty. Her trial lasted from June 9 to June 13, a much longer period than the usual trial of the time, thanks to the exhaustive efforts of her lawyers, who \"pleaded so subtillie for her, that the assise could not be resolved befo�e the lYh of June.\" She was condemned to be burned alive, an extreme sentence usually only given to witches"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"208 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND who refused to confess, or who confessed and then recanted their confession. Effie maintained her innocence throughout her ordeal. James himself took an active part in directing her torture. He wrote to John Maitland, who was overseeing the interrogation: \"Let Effie McCalyan see the stoop two or three days, and upon the sudden stay her in hope of a confession.\" The stoop was the wooden post to which the condemned was bound. It had to be set in the ground at each execution by a woodwright, who was paid ten shillings for the job. It seems that James hoped that by showing her the stake that would be used at her burning, she would break down and confess. The Earl of Bothwell and his supporters were quite nervous that she would accuse Bothwell, who was her friend, and hoped that her execution would proceed swiftly, as a way of closing her mouth. This does not necessar­ily imply any guilt on Bothwell's part, merely a concern that a woman would not be able to withstand torture as well as a man, and might say anything to relieve the pain. As it happened, they need not have worried, since she endured her ordeal with great courage and loyalty to Bothwell. Accounts of her execution indicate that she was strangled before being burned on Castle Hill on June 25, 1591, though no reason is given as to why the severity of her sentence was miti­gated. In her statement to the crowd at her execution, she \"tooke it upon her conscience that she was innocent of all the crymes laid to her charge.\" The long delay between her sentencing and death was the result of an assertion by Effie, after the verdict was read against her, that she was pregnant. Since the unborn child of a convicted criminal was considered to be innocent, execution of a pregnant woman was delayed until after the birth of the baby. Note 9: Barbara Napier, the sister-in-law of the Laird of Carschog­gill, was convicted by a jury on May 8, 1591, for consulting with witches, specifically Richard Graham and Agnes Sampson. The"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 209 other more serious charges against her, chief among them that she had attempted to kill the King with a \"picture of wax,\" that she had caused a ferryboat to sink between Leith and Kinghorn, resulting in the loss of sixty lives, and that she was responsible for the death of the Earl of Angus, were dismissed by the jury. The partial acquittal was accomplished by packing the jury box with her friends. The English ambassador Sir Robert Bowes wrote in a letter to Lord Burghley: \"By the counsel assigned to her, and by her challenges and shifts, she both put off the gentlemen returned to have been of her assize, in whose places others of this town­where she has many kinsfolk and friends of good credit-were received, and also continued the matter in debate until two of the clock in this morning, before the jury or assize-as they term it­could be chosen and charged.\" Although they found her guilty of consultation with witches, no judgement was pronounced against her. As Bowes put it, she was at \"the King's pleasure .\" Obviously the king was not pleased. She was sentenced to be strangled and burned on Castle Hill on May 11, but on that day, when the stake had been erected and piled all around with flammable materials ready for the torch, and the townsfolk had gathered to watch the show, her friends announced that she c ould not be put to death because she was pregnant. James was beside himself with rage. He instructed John Mai­tland: \"Try by the mediciners whether Barbara Napier be with child or not. Take no delaying answer. If you find she be not, to the fire with her presently, and cause bowel her publically.\" To bowel someone (Bowes spelled it 'bouell\") is to disembowel that person. James wanted her strangled at the stake , and her belly cut open to prove to the crowd that she had not been with child. He was determined not to allow this clever and able woman whom, as he believed, had made an attempt on not only his own life,"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"210 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND but the life of his young queen, to escape the fire through legal trickery. While Barbara's pregnancy was being examined, her friends were working hard in the background on her behalf. Because the act of Parliament against simple consultation with a witch had not actually been put into execution, it was decided that a death sentence was too harsh a punishment for her cri me. James be­came convinced that her acquittal of the more serious charges, including the charge of high treason for attempting to end his life, was a plot against him intended to frustrate his will in the matter. He was particularly upset that the men he had hand­picked to be a part of the trial had been excluded through legal maneuvering. Clerics in Edinburgh began to criticize his lack of action publically from the pulpit. On May 26, James had the jury members charged with an assize of error. Bowes wrote to Burghley, \"The assize of error to reverse the verdict given in favor of Barbara Napier is pro­claimed. The assizers are commanded to be here two days before their appearance in court, that the King may speak with them. Thus to reverse the verdict is lawful, but a great novelty, not hith­erto practised.\" The speech James delivered to the jury on June 7, 1591, is his famous Tolbooth speech, the relevent portions of which are reproduced in Appendix C. James caused the court to be reassembled and ordered that Barbara Napier be strangled, burned, and her property forfeited to him. The original jury was then itself tried on the charge of acquitting a witch. Although it would have seemed that Barbara Napier's fate was sealed by the extraordinary machinations of the King against her, there is no record of her execution. After a passage of time, her prosecution was quietly dropped without ever being re­solved. This is difficult to explain. Perhaps she actually was preg­nant, having had the foresight to put herself in this condition just prior to her trial.

James may have allowed himself to be persuaded by his advisors that he was walking on thin ice, legally, and that it would be prudent to allow the matter to fa de away. However it happened, her \"many kinsfolk and friends of good credit\" pre­vailed in her behalf, and she was the only one of the fo ur princi­pals in the North Berwick affair who was not burned. Note 10: Agnes Sampson, known locally as the Wise Wife of Keith, was described by a contemporary as being \"a woman not of the base and ignorant sort of witches, but matron-like, grave and settled in her answers, which were a ll to some purpose\" (Spot­tiswoode, History of the Church of Scotland, Vol. II, pages 411-412). Her skills as both a midwife and a healer were held in high regard in Edinburgh and the surrounding towns. There can be little ques­tion that she relied upon magic practices and the occult virtues of herbs and stones for her cures. Many of the charges against her in­volved accurate diagnoses of diseases, and cures by occult means. One technique she used was to take the disease of the sick person onto herself, then, after suffering with it until the morning, cast it off onto a dog or cat. She was also an accomplished seer. She kept a large black dog named Elva that may have served as the host fo r her fa mil­iar spirit, and used the dog fo r purposes of divination. A certain amount of theatrics must have been employed to impre ss on­lookers. She would ask the dog questions, and the dog would an­swer her. The dog was summoned with the magic word \"hola,\" which appears in several places in the North Berwick testimonies. It was her practice to diagnose whether or not an individual would recover from sickness by reciting a prayer. If she stopped speaking once before the prayer was done, it was a sign that the sick person was bewitched, but if she stopped twice, it was a sure sign that the person would die. Sometimes when asked to come and heal, she would refuse after saying the prayer, on"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"212 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND the grounds that there was nothing she could do, the person was going to die in any case. When first accused of witchcraft, she denied all charges. Her torture was extreme. All the hair was shaved off from every part of her body, and she was pricked for the witch mark, a not only painful but humiliating experience. The mark was found on her vulva. A witch's bridle was placed on her head, an instrument of iron that pressed four sharp spikes into her mouth to prevent her from muttering or chanting magic charms. She was \"thrawed\" like Gilly Duncan and John Fian, and deprived of sleep fo r a pro­longed period. Finally, her proud spirit broke and she began to implicate others, and to offer fantastic details of evil works and plots against the king. The list of charges made against her at her trial of January 27, 1591, is longer than that of any other accused. Robert Bowes wrote to Lord Burghley that of the one hundred and two charges that were brought against her, she confessed to fifty-eight. The sentence read against her was that she \"be taken to the Castle of Edinburgh, and there bound to a stake and stran­gled until she was dead, and thereafter her body to be burned to ashes.\" The records do not show a date of execution, but it was probably no more than a few days following her conviction. At the stake she apologized for causing the death of the Earl of Douglas with a small fi gure of yellow wax. Note 11: There was a belief that witches travelled across the sea using sieves fo r boats. A riddle is a coarse-screened sieve fo r sepa­rating chaff from grain. The witches related that while they were crossing the sea, and making merry with wine, they could see the Devil going before them over the waves, looking in the dis­tance somewhat like a large rolling haystack (Scot, Demonology and Wi tchcraft, page 302). Agnes Sampson confessed that they went across the water in a boat shaped like a chimney, and that the Devil resembed a hayrick. It is tempting to think that when asked about these matters by her interrogators, she responded with the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 213 most absurd things that popped into her head, with the expecta­tion that they were so silly they would not be believed. Instead they were solemnly pronounced against her at her trial. Note 12: The transcript of the questioning of Agnes Sampson puts the number in the church on All Hallow's Eve at around ninety women and six men, not two hundred women. According to Bar­bara Napier, there were \"seven score\" present, or around 140 per­sons. Note 13: \"Kirk\" is a Scottish term for a church. Note 14: \"Jew's trump\" was the earlier name for the instrument known as the \"Jew's harp.\" It consists of a metal frame with a flex­ible steel tongue. The frame is held between the teeth while the steel tongue is struck with the finger, and the twanging tone i s varied by enlarging or diminishing the cavity of the mouth. Note 15: The great sabbat meeting at North Berwick Kirk is one of the most notorious in all the records of the witch trials. It is sup­posed to have happened on Hall oween in the year 1590, and if it was indeed a real event, probably took place around midnight­in her testimony concerning a previous solitary meeting with the Devil at the North Berwick Kirk, Agnes Sampson stated that it occured at eleven o'clock. North Berwick is located on a headland on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, and the towns of Tranent, Edinburgh, and Leith are ranged to the west along the same side of this body of water, although Tranent is somewhat inland. Saltpans, presently known as Prestonpans, is located about two miles from Tranent on the coast. On that memorable night the witches stood or sat in their sieves and were borne, some of them as much as fifteen miles, over the sea along the southern shore of the Firth of Forth in an easterly direction, laughing, call­ing out to each other, and drinking wine, while the Devil in the form of a tumbling vortex went before them on top of the waves to lead the way."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"214 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND When they landed next to the church, they all held hands and danced a reel on the green, singing \"Comer, go you before, comer go you, if you will not go before, comer let me,\" as Gilly Duncan played on her Jew's harp to provide the music. Barbara Napier led the dance up and down the longest dimension of the kirkyard. The six male witches whirled themselves around nine times widdershins, or counterclockwise, with, according to the testimony of Agnes Sampson, John Pian leading the ring, his face covered or muffled with cloth. The far more numerous female witches twirled about six times in the same direction, widder­shins. In magic, turning widdershins is usually done for works of evil. Doctor Pian blew his breath into the keyhole of the lock on the front doors of the church, causing the lock to spring open. The church was illuminated inside with black candles that burned with a strange blue light. In the pulpit the Devil awaited them, dressed in the clothing of an ordinary man. He was de­scribed as a 'black man\" by Doctor Pian, although this may have meant only that he was clothed all in black garments. If this ex­traordinary meeting ever took place, it is likely that the man play­ing the part of the Devil had his face obscured in some manner, as did John Pian, to conceal his identity. The Devil was exceed­ingly annoyed at their late arrival, and ordered as a penance and a sign of their continuing loyalty that they kiss his buttocks, which he exposed by dropping his hose and extending his ass ove r the rail of the pulpit. One by one the witches filed up and kissed his backside before seating themselves for the meeting. The purpose of the gathering was to work black magic against King james and cause his death. This was to be done using a wax image of the king that had previously been given to the Devil by Agnes Sampson for the Devil to bewitch. How­ever, the Devil had neglected to bring the prepared image with him, which caused a good deal of irritation among his congrega­tion. I will quote from the partial transcript of the accusations"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 2!5 against Barbara Napier presented by Margaret A. Murray. I have modernized the text, since the original is quite difficult to read because of the archaic spelling. And the Devil stood up in the pulpit like a great black man, having a black book in his hand, and called on every one of them, desiring them all to be good servants to him, and he should be a good master to them. Robert Grierson and john Fian stood on his left hand; and the said Robert found great fault with the Devil and cried out, that all witches were worried greatly here, because his Highness' picture was not given them, as was promised: the said Effie McCalyan remembered and bid the said Robert Grierson to inquire fo r the picture, meaning his Majesty's picture, which should have been roasted. Robert Grierson said these words: \"Where is the thing you promised?\" Meaning the picture of wax, devised fo r roasting and undoing his Highness' person, which Agnes Sampson gave to him; and Robert cried to \"have the turn done\"; yet his Highness' name was not named, until they that were women named him; crav­ing in plain terms his Highness' picture. But he answered, \"It should be gotten the next meeting; and he would hold the next assembly fo r that cause the sooner: it was not ready at that time.\" Robert Grierson answered, \"You promised to us, and fa lse it was.\" And four fo rthright women were very earnest and insistent to have it. And the said Barbara and Effie McCalyan got then a promise of the Devil, that his Highness' picture should be gotten to them two, and that right soon: and this matter of his Highness' picture was the cause of that assembly. (Murray, Wi tch-cult in Wes tern Europe, page 55) Much of the account of the meeting at North Berwick Kirk, and probably the whole of it, is fantasy. However, there is a plau­sibility about the homely details of the event that makes it dif­ficult not to suspect that it may have had some basis in reality. It is scarcely to be believed that the witches would have stood up in the church and berated the Devil for being late with the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"216 NEWS FROM SCOTLAND king's portrait, but that they might treat a man representing the Devil in this way, who was dressed in a black costume with his face masked or darkened with burnt cork, especially if they were drunk on wine, is more likely. Note 16: The Devil of the witches' sabbat is so often described as a man, who is sometimes masked, rather than as some sort of fan­tastic monster, that Margaret Murray offered the opinion that he was always a human being: \"The evidence of the witches makes it abundantly clear that the so-called Devil was a human being, generally a man, occasionally a woman\" (Murray, Wi tch-cult in Western Europe, page 31). Montague Summers identified the devil personage in the kirk as Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, who wished to kill James in order to open his own claim to the throne. Bothwell was men­tioned by name in the testimony of Agnes Sampson, who de­clared that she had constructed a wax figure of the king to be melted and consumed in the fire \"at the instance of a noble man Francis Erle Bodowell\" (Summers, Geography of Wi tchcraft, page 223). Summers pointed out that when Bothwell was living in Naples in 1610, he had the reputation of an accomplished necro­mancer. It was also the conviction of Margaret Murray that the devil of North Berwick Kirk was the Earl of Bothwell. She made this identification on the assumption that where there is a plot to murder, there must be motive, and Bothwell had the best reason of anyone to wish to see James dead. This sort of speculation is entertaining but should not be given too much weight since it is unsupported by any hard evi­dence. We have no way of knowing if there ever was a collec­tive meeting of witches presided over by a man wearing a devil's costume, much less that the man was Bothwell. It cannot be em­phasized too often that the testimony extracted under torture is worthless, and no other evidence exists for Bothwell as the leader of the North Berwick witches."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"NEWS FROM SCOTLAND 217 Note 17: james and Anne romantically came together in Oslo after Anne's ship sprang a leak on the voyage to Scotland and was driven into the Norwegian port by bad weather, and James sailed north to meet her.

Presumably it was christened in the name of Kingjames. Note 19: The \"chiefest parts\" of a man are probably his genitals. They symbolize the life force or vitality. Note 20: The knucklebones from the fingers or toes of a corpse. Knucklebones have a long history in magic as an instrument of divination. They are cast in a way similar to dice. Note 21: The explanation james might give for the coldness of the Devil' s member is that the Devil caused a corpse to be animated for the purpose of intercourse with the witches. If the witches' conventions actually occurred, and the lover in the kirk was a man rather than a demon, the coldness might be explained in a more natural way as the result of the employment of a dildo to penetrate the witches, something that would likely be required due to the sheer number of witches that must be coupled with. Note 22: john Fian was said to have acted as the clerk or recorder at the witch gatherings. Being a schoolteacher, he was the natural choice for this office. One of the woodcuts accompanying News From Scotland shows Fian seated at a desk with a pen in his left hand (the sinister side of the body), writing upon a sheet of paper, or perhaps into a records book.

This worde Magie in the Persian toung, importes as muche as to be ane contemplator or Interpretour of Divine and heavenlie sciences: which being first vsed amongs the Chaldees, through their ignorance of the true divinitie, was esteemed and reputed amongst them, as a principall vertue: And therefore , was named vnjustlie with an honorable stile, which name the Greekes imitated, generally importing all these kindes of vnlawfull artes. And this word Nec­romancie is a Greek word, compounded of NEKpwv & IJ.UV\"tEta, which is to say, the Prophecie by the dead. This last name is given, to this black & vnlawfull science by the figure Synedoche, because it is a principal part of that art, to serue them selues with dead carcages in their diuinations. PHI.

Yea, they may be: but it is onelie secundum quid: For it is not by anie power that they can haue over him, but ex pacto allanerlie: whereby he oblices himself in some trifles to them, that he may on the other part obteine the fruition of their body & soule, which is the onlie thing he huntes for.

Which, at the first face appearing lawfull vnto them, in respect the ground therof seemeth to proceed of natu­rall causes onelie: they are so allure d thereby, that finding their prac­tize to prooue true in sundry things, they studie to know the cause thereof: and so mounting from degree to degree, vpon the slipperie and vncertaine scale of curiositie; they are at last entised, that where"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 231 lawfull artes or sciences failes, to satisfie their restles mindes, even to seeke to that black and vnlawfull science of Magie.

Ye must first remember to laye the ground, that I tould you before: which is, that i t is no power inherent in the circles, or in the holines of the names of God blasphemou­slie vsed: nor in whatsoeuer rites or ceremonies at that time vsed, that either can raise any infernall spirit, or yet limitat him perforce within or without these circles. For it is he onelie, the father of all lyes, who hauing first of all prescribed that forme of doing, fein­ing himselfe to he commanded & restreined thereby, wil be loath to passe the boundes of these injunctiones; aswell thereby to make them glory in the impiring ouer him (as I saide before:) As likewise to make himselfe so to be trusted in these little thinges, that he may haue the better commoditie thereafter, to deceiue them in the end"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"236 APPENDIX A with a tricke once for all; I meane the euerlasting perdition of their soul & body. Then laying this ground, as I haue said, these conju­rationes must haue few or mo in number of the persones conjur­ers (alwaies passing the singuler number) according to the qualitie of the circle, and forme of apparition. Two principall thinges can­not well in that errand be wanted: holie-water (whereby the Deuill mockes the Papistes) and some present of a liuing thing vnto him. There ar likewise certaine seasons, dayes and houres, that they ob­serue in this purpose: These things being all readie, and prepared, circles are made triangular, quadrangular, round, double or single, according to the forme of apparition that they craue. But to speake of the diuerse formes of the circles, of the innumerable characters and crosses that are within and without, and out-through the same, of the diuers formes of apparitiones, that that craftie spirit illudes them with, and of all such particulars in that action, I remit it to ouer-manie that haue busied their heades in describing of the same; as being but curious, and altogether vnprofitable.

If this be not now a just cause to make them wearie of these formes of conjuration, I leaue it to you to judge vpon; considering the long-somenesse of the labour, the precise keeping of dayes and houres (as I haue said) The terrible­nesse of apparition, and the present perrell that they stande in, in missing the least circumstance or freite, that they ought to obserue: And on the other parte, the Deuil is glad to mooue them to a plaine and square dealing with him as I said before."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 237 CHAP.

But goe forwarde now I pray you to these turnes, fra they become once deacons in this craft. EPI. From time that they once plainelie begin to contract with him: The effect of their contract consistes in two thinges; in formes and effectes, as I be gan to tell alreadie, were it not yee interrupted me (for although the contract be mutuall; I speake first of that part, wherein the Deuill oblishes himselfe to them) by formes, I meane in what shape or fashion he shall come vnto them, when they call vpon him. And by effectes, I vnderstand, in what special sorts of se­ruices he bindes himselfe to be subject vnto them. The qualitie of these formes and effectes, is lesse or greater, according to the skil and art of the Magician. For as to the formes, to some of the baser sorte of them he oblishes him selfe to appeare at their calling vpon him, by such a proper name which he shewes vnto them, either in likenes of a dog, a Catte, an Ape, or such-like other beast; or else to answere by a voyce onlie. The effects are to answere to such de­mands, as concernes curing of disseases, their own particular me­nagery: or such other base things as they require of him. But to the most curious sorte, in the formes he will oblish himselfe , to enter in a dead bodie, and there out of to giue such answers, of the euent of battels, of maters concerning the estate of commonwelths, and such like other great questions: yea, to some he will be a continu­all attender, in forme of a Page: He will permit himselfe to be con­jured, for the space of so many yeres, ether in a tablet or a ring, or such like thing, which they may easely carrie about with them: He"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"238 APPENDIX A giues them power to sel such wares to others , whereof some will bee dearer, and some better cheape; according to the lying or true speaking of the Spirit that is conjured therein. Not but that in verie deede, all Devils must be lyars; but so they abuse the simplicitie of these wretches, that becomes their schollers, that they make them beleeue, that at the fall of Luciftr, some Spirites fell in the aire , some in the fire, some in the water, some in the lande: In which Elemen­tes they still remaine. Whereupon they build, that such as fell in the fire, or in the aire, are truer then they, who fell in the water or in the land, which is al but meare trattles, & forged be the author of al deceit . For they fel not be weight, as a solide substance, to stick in any one parte: But the principall part of their fal, consisting in qualitie, by the falling from the grace of God wherein they were created, they continued still thereafter, and shal do while the latter daie, in wandring through the worlde, as Gods hang-men, to execute such turnes as he employes them in.

For though that I will not denie that there be a forme of ardour amongst the Angels in Heauen, and consequentlie, was amongst them before their fall; yet, either that they bruike the same sensine; or that God will permit vs to know by damned Deuils, such heauenlie mysteries of his, which he would not reueale to vs neither by Scripture nor Prophets, I thinke no Christiane will once thinke it.

As Moyses rod being casten downe, was no doubt turned in a natural Serpent: where as the Deuill (as Gods Ape) counterfetting that by his Magicians, maid their wandes to appeare so, onelie to mennes outward senses: as kythed in effect by their being deuoured by the other.

I say, they sauour of the panne them selues, or at least little better, And yet I would be glad to heare their reasons. PHI. There are two principallie, that euer I heard vsed; beside that which is founded vpon the comon Prouerb (that the Necroman­cers commands the Deuill, which ye haue already refuted) The one is grounded vpon a receiued custome: The other vpon an authoritie,"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 24 1 which some thinkes infallible. Vpon custome, we see that diuerse Christian Princes and Magistrates seuere punishers of Witches, will not onelie ouer-see Magicians to liue within their dominions; but euen some-times delight to see them prooue some of their prac­ticques. The other reason is, that Moyses being brought vp (as it is expreslie said in the Scriptures) in all the sciences of the AEgyptians; whereof no doubt, this was one of the principalles. And he notwith­standing of this arte, pleasing God, as he did, consequentlie that art professed by so godlie a man, coulde not be vnlawfull. EPI. As to the first of your reasones, grounded vpon custome: I saie, an euill custome can neuer be accepted for a good law, for the ouer great ignorance of the worde in some Princes and Magistrates, and the contempt thereof in others, moues them to sinne heavelie against their office in that poynt. As to the other reasone, which seemes to be of greater weight, if it were formed in a Syllogisme; it behooued to be in manie termes, and full o f fallacies (to speake in termes o f Logicque) for first, that that generall proposition; affirm­ing Moyses to be taught in all the sciences of the AEgyptians, should conclude that he was taught in Magie, I see no necessity. For we must vnderstand that the spirit of God there , speaking of sciences, vnder­standes them that are lawfull; for except they be lawfull, they are but abusiue called sciences, & are but ignorances indeede: Nam homo pictus, non es t homo. Secondlie, giuing that he had bene taught in it, there is great difference, betwixt knowledge and practising of a thing (as I said before) For God knoweth all thinges, being alwaies good, and of our sinne & our infirmitie proceedeth our ignorance. Third­lie, giuing that he had both studied and practised the same (which is more nor monstruous to be beleeued by any Christian) yet we know well inough, that before that euer the spirite o f God began to call Moyses, he was fled out of AEgypt, being fourtie yeares of age, for the slaughter of an AEgyptian, and in his good-father Iethroes lande, first called at the firie bushe, hauing remained there other fourtie yeares in exile: so that suppose he had beene the wickeddest man in the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"242 APPENDIX A worlde before, he then became a changed and regenerat man, and very litle of olde Moyses remained in him.

Whose reasons I wil shortely alleage vnto you, that ye may satisfie me as well in that, as ye haue done in the rest. For first, whereas the Scripture seemes to prooue Witchcraft to be, by diuerse examples, and speciallie by sundrie of the same, which ye haue alleaged, it is thought by some, that these places speakes of Magicians and Necromancers onlie, & not of Witches. As in special, these wise men of Pharaohs, that counter­feited Moyses miracles, were Magicians say they, & not Witches: As likewise that Pythonisse that Saul consulted with: And so was Simon Magus in the new Testament, as that very stile importes. Second­lie, where ye would oppone the dailie practicque, & confession of so manie, that is thought likewise to be but verie melancholicque"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"244 APPENDIX A imaginations of simple rauing creatures. Thirdly, if Witches had such power of Witching of folkes to death, (as they say they haue) there had bene none left aliue long sence in the world, but they: at the least, no good or godlie person o f whatsoeuer estate, coulde haue escaped their deuilrie. EPI. Your three reasons as I take, ar grounded the first of them negative vpon the Scripture : The second affirmative vpon Physicke : And the thirde vpon the certaine proofe of experience. As to your first, it is most true indeede, that all these wise men of Pharaoh were Magicians of art: As likewise it appeares wei that the Pythonisse, with whom Saul consulted, was of that same profession: & so was Simon Magus. But yee omitted to speake of the Lawe of God, wherein are all Magicians, Diuines, Enchanters, Sorcerers, Witches, & whatsouer of that kinde that consultes with the Deuill, plainelie prohibited, and alike threatned against. And besides that, she who had the Spirite of Python, in the Actes [marginal gloss: Act. 16.], whose Spirite was put to silence by the Apostle, coulde be no other thing but a verie Sor­cerer or Witch, if ye admit the vulgare distinction, to be in a maner true, whereof I spake in the beginning of our conference. For that spirit whereby she conquested such gaine to her Master, was not at her raising or commanding, as she pleased to appoynt, but spake by her toung, aswel publicklie, as priuatelie: Whereby she seemed to draw nearer to the sort of Demoniakes or possessed, if that conjunc­tion betwixt them, had not bene of her owne consent: as it appeared by her, not being tormented therewith: And by her conquesting of such gaine to her masters (as I haue alreadie said.) As to your sec­ond reason grounded vpon Physick, in attributing their confessiones or apprehensiones, to a naturall melancholicque humour: Anie that pleases Physicallie to consider vpon the naturall humour of melan­cholie, according to all the Physicians, that euer writ thereupon, they sall finde that that will be ouer short a cloak to couer their knauery with: For as the humor o f Melancholie in the selfe is blacke, heauie and terrene, so are the symptomes thereof, in any persons that are"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 245 subject therevnto, leannes, palenes, desire of solitude: and if they come to the highest degree therof, mere folie and Manie: where as by the contrarie, a great nomber of them that euer haue bene con­vict or confessors of Witchcraft, as may be presently scene by manie that haue at this time confessed: they are by the contrarie, I say, some of them rich and worldly-wise, some of them fatte or corpu ­lent in their bodies, and most part of them altogether giuen ouer to the pleasures of the flesh, continual haunting of companie, and all kind of me rrines, both lawfull and vnlawfull, which are thinge s di­rectly contrary to the symptomes of Melancholie, whereof I spake , and further experience daylie proues how loath they are to confesse without torture, which witnesseth their guiltines, where by the con­trary, the Melancholicques neuer spares to bewray themselues, by their continuall discourses, feeding therby their humor in that which they thinke no crime.

EPI. This word of Sorcerie is a Latine worde, which is taken from casting of the lot, & therefore he that vseth it, is called Sortiarius a sorte. As to the word of Wi tchcraft , it is nothing but a proper name giuen in our language. The cause wherefore they were called sor­tiarij , proceeded of their practicques seeming to come of lot or chance: Such as the turning of the riddle: the knowing of the forme of prayers, or such like tokens: If a person diseased woulde liue or dye. And in generall, that name was giuen them for vsing of such charmes, and freites, as that Crafte teacheth them. Manie poynts of their craft and practicques are common betuixt the Magicians and them: for they serue both one Master, althought in diuerse fash­ions. And as I deuided the Necromancers, into two sorts, learned and vnlearned; so must I denie them in other two, riche and of better accompt, poore and o f basser degree. These two degrees now of persones, that practises this craft, answers to the passions in them, which (I told you before) the Deuil vsed as meanes to intyse them to his seruice, for such of them as are in great miserie and pouertie, he allures to follow him, by promising vnto them greate riches, and worldlie commoditie. Such as though riche, yet burnes in a desperat desire of reuenge, hee allures them by promises, to get their turne satisfied to their hartes contentment. It is to be noted nowe, that that olde and craftie enemie of ours, assailes none, though touched with any of these two extremities, except he first finde an entresse reddy for him, either by the great ignorance of the person he deales with, ioyned with an euilllife, or else by their carelesnes and con­tempt of God: And fi nding them in an vtter despair, for one of these two former causes that I haue spoken of; he prepares the way by feeding them craftely in their humour, and filling them further and further with despaire, while he finde the time proper to discouer himself vnto them. At which time, either vpon their walking solita­rie in the fieldes, or else lying pansing in their bed; but alwaies with-"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 247 out the company of any other, he either by a voyce, or in likenesse of a man inquires of them, what troubles them: and promiseth them, a suddaine and certaine waie of remedie, vpon condition on the other parte, that they follow his advise; and do such thinges as he wil require of them: Their mindes being prepared before hand, as I haue alreadie spoken, they easelie agreed vnto that demande of his: And syne settes an other tryist, where they may meete againe. At which time, before he proceede any further with them, he first per­swades them to addict themselues to his seruice: which being easely obteined, he then discouers what he is vnto them: makes them to renunce their God and Baptisme directlie, and giues them his marke vpon some secreit place of their bodie, which remaines soare vn­healed, while his next meeting with them, and thereafter euer insen­sible, how soeuer it be nipped or pricked by any, as is dailie proued, to giue them a proofe thereby, that as in that doing, hee could hurte and heale them; so all their ill and well doing thereafter, must de­pende vpon him. And besides that, the intollerable dolour that they feele in that place, where he hath marked them, serues to waken them, and not to let them rest, while their next meeting againe: fear­ing least otherwaies they might either forget him, being as new Pren­tises, and not well inough founded yet, in that fiendlie follie: or else remembring of that horrible promise they made him, at their last meeting, they might skunner at the same, and preasse to call it back. At their thirde meeting, he makes a shew to be carefull, to performe his promises, either by teaching them waies howe to get themselues reuenged, if they be of that sort: Or els by teaching them lessons, how by moste vilde and vnlawfull meanes, they may obtaine gaine, and worldlie commoditie, if they be of the other sorte.

It restes then that ye discourse vpon their practises, fra they be passed Pren­tises: for I would faine heare what is possible to them to performe in verie deede. Although they serue a common Master with the Nec­romancers, (as I haue before saide) yet serue they him in an other forme. For as the meanes are diuerse, which allures them to these vnlawfull artes of seruing of the Deuill; so by diuerse waies vse they their practises, answering to these meanes, which first the Oeuill, vsed as instrumentes in them; though al tending to one end: To wit, the enlargeing of Sathans tyrannie, and crossing of the propaga­tion of the Kingdome of CHRI ST, so farre as lyeth in the possibili­tie, either of the one or other sorte, or of the Deuill their Master. For where the Magicians, as allured by curiositie, in the most parte of their practises, seekes principallie the satisfying of the same, and to winne to themselues a popular honoure and estimation: These Witches on the other parte, being intised ether for the desire of reuenge, or of worldly riches, their whole practises are either to hurte men and their gudes, or what they possesse, for satisfying of their cruell mindes in the former, or else by the wracke in quhat­soeuer sorte, of anie whome God will permitte them to haue power off, to satisfie their greedie desire in the last poynt.

To the effect that they may performe such seruices of their false Master, as he employes them in, the deuill as Gods Ape, coun­terfeites in his seruantes this seruice & forme of adoration, that God prescribed and made his seruantes to practise. For as the seruants of GOD, publicklie vses to conveene for seruing of him, so makes he them in great numbers to conveene (though publickly they dare not) for his seruice. As none conueenes to the adoration and worshipping of God, except they be marked with his seale, the Sacrament of Bap­tisme: So none serues Sathan, and conueenes to the adoring of him, that are not marked with that marke, wherof I alredy spake . As the Minister sent by God, teacheth plainely at the time of their publick conuentions, how to serue him in spirit & truth: so that vncleane spirite, in his owne person teacheth his Disciples, at the time of their conueening, how to worke all kinde of mischiefe: And craues compt of all their horrible and detestable proceedinges passed, for aduance­ment of his seruice. Yea, that he may the more viuelie counterfeit and scorne God, he oft times makes his slaues to conveene in these ver­rie places, which are destinat and ordeined for the conveening of the servantes of God (I meane by Churches) But this farre, which I haue yet said, I not onelie take it to be true in their opiniones, but euen so to be indeede. For the forme that he vsed in counterfeiting God amongst the Gentiles, makes me so to thinke: As God spake by his Or­acles, spake he not so by his? As GOD had aswell bloudie Sacrifices, as others without bloud, had not he the like? As God had Churches sanctified to his seruice, with Altars, Priests, Sacrifices, Ceremonies and Prayers; had he not the like polluted to his seruice? As God gaue responses by Vrim and Thummim, gaue he not his responses by the in­tralls of beastes, by the singing of Fowles, and by their actiones in the aire?

And this way may be easelie b eleued: an other way is some-what more strange: and yet is it possible to be true: which is by being carryed by the force of the Spirite which is their conducter, either aboue the earth or aboue the Sea swiftlie, to the place where they are to meet: which I am perswaded to be likewaies possible, in respect that as Habakkuk was carryed by the Angell in that forme, to the denne where Danielllaie; [marginal gloss: Apocrypha of Bel and the Dragon.] so thinke I, the Deuill will be reddie to imitate God, as well in that as in other thinges: which is much more possible to him to doe, being a Spirite, then to a mighty winde, being but a naturall meteore, to transporte from one place to an other a solide bodie, as is commonlie and dailie seene in practise: But in this violent forme they cannot be carryed, but a shone boundes, agreeing with the space that they may reteine their breath: for if it were longer, their breath could not remaine vnextinguished, their bodie being carryed in such a violent & forceable maner, as be example: If one fall off an small height, his life is but in perrell, according to the harde or soft lighting: But if one fall from an high and stay rocke , his breath wilbe forceablie banished from the bodie, before he can win to the earth, as is oft seen by experience. And in this transporting they say them­selues, that they are inuisible to anie other, except amongst themse­lues; which may also be possible in my opinion. For if the deuil may forme what kinde of impressiones he pleases in the aire, as I haue said before, speaking of Magie, why may he not far easilier thicken & obscure so the air, that is next about them by contracting it strait together, that the beames of any other mans eyes, cannot pearce thorow the same, to see them?

And for verefying therof, wil giue euident tokens, aswel by witnesses that haue seene their body lying senseles in the meane time, as by naming persones, whomwith they mette, and giuing tokens quhat purpose was amongst them, whome otherwaies they could not haue knowen: for this forme of journeing, they affirme to vse most, when they are transported from one Countrie to another. PHI. Surelie I long to heare your owne opinion of this: For they are like old wiues trattles about the fire. EPI. The reasons that moues me to thinke that these are meere illusiones, ar these. First for them that are transformed in l i kenes of beastes or foules, can enter through so narrow passages, although I may easelie beleeue that the Deuill coulde by his woorkemanshippe vpon the aire, make them appeare to be in such formes, either to themselues or to others: Yet how he can contract a solide bodie within so little roome, I thinke it is directlie contrarie to it selfe, for to be made so little, and yet not diminished: To be so straitlie drawen to­gether, and yet feele no paine; I thinke it is so contrarie to the qualitie of a naturall bodie, and so like to the li ttle transubstantiat god in the Papistes Masse, that I can neuer beleeue it. So to haue a quantitie, is so proper to a solide bodie, that as all Philosophers concludes, it can­not be any more without one, then a spirite can haue one. For when PETER came out of the prison, and the doores all locked: [marginal gloss: Act. 12.] It was not by any contracting of his bodie in so little roome: but by the giuing place of the dore, though vn-espyed by the Gaylors. And yet is there no comparison, when this is done, betuixt the power of God, and of the Deuill. As to their forme of extasie and spiritu­all transporting, it is certaine the soules going out of the bodie, is the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 253 onely difinition of naturall death: and who are once dead, God forbid wee should thinke that it should lie in the power of all the Deuils in Hell, to restore them to their life againe: Although he can put his owne spirite in a dead bodie, which the Necromancers commonlie practise, as yee haue harde. For that is the office properly belonging to God; and besides that, the soule once parting from the bodie, cannot wander anie longer in the worlde, but to the owne resting place must it goe immediatlie, abiding the conjunction of the bodie againe, at the lat­ter daie. And what CHRIST or the Prophets did miraculouslie in this case, it cannot in no Christian mans opinion be maid common with the Deuill. As for anie tokens that they giue for proouing of this, it is verie possible to the Deuils craft, to perswade them to these meanes. For he being a spirite, may hee: not so rauishe their thoughtes, and dull their sences, that their bodie lying as dead, hee may object to their spirites as it were in a dreame, & (as the Poets write of Morpheus) rep­resente such formes of persones, of places, and other circumstances, as he pleases to illude them with? Yea, that he maie deceiue them with the greater efficacie, may hee not at that same instant, by fel­low angelles of his, illude such other persones so in that same fashion, whome with he makes them to beleeue that they mette; that all their reportes and tokens, though seuerallie examined, may euerie one agree with an other. And that whatsoeuer actiones, either in hurting men or beasts: or whatsoeuer other thing that they falselie imagine, at that time to haue done, may by himselfe or his marrowes, at that same time be done indeede; so as if they would giue for a token of their being rauished at the death of such a person within so shorte space thereafter, whom they beleeue to haue poysoned, or witched at that instante, might hee not at that same houre , haue smitten that same person by the permission of GOD, to the farther deceiuing of them, and to mooue others to beleeue them? And this is surelie the likeliest way, and most according to reason, which my judgement can fi nde out in this, and whatsoeuer vther vnnaturall poyntes of their confes­sion.

But before yee goe further, permit mee I pray you to inter­rupt you one worde, which yee haue put mee in memorie of, by speaking of Women. What can be the cause that there are twentie women giuen to that craft, where ther is one man? EPI. The reason is easie, for as that sexe is frailer then man is, so is it easier to be intrapped in these grosse snares of the Deuill, as was ouer well proued to be true, by the Serpents deceiuing of Eua at the beginning, whi ch makes him the homelier with that sexe sensine.

To some others at these times hee teacheth, how to make Pictures of waxe or clay: That by the rosting thereof, the persones; that they beare the name of, may be continuallie melted or dryed awaie by continuall sicknesse. To some hee giues such stones or poulders, as will helpe to cure or cast on diseases: And to some he teacheth kindes of vncouthe poysons, which Mediciners vnder­standes not (for he is farre cunningner then man in the knowledge of all the occult proprieties of nature) not that anie of these meanes which hee teacheth them (except the poysons which are composed of thinges naturall) can of them selues helpe any thing to these turnes, that they are employed in, but onelie being Gods Ape, as well in that, as in all other thinges. Even as God by his Sacramentes which are earthlie of themselues workes a heavenlie effect, though no waies by any cooperation in them: And as CHRIST by clay & spettle wrought together, opened the eies of the blynd man, [marginal gloss: John. 9.] sup­pose there was no vertue in that which he outwardlie applyed, so the Deuill will haue his out-warde meanes to be shewes as it were of his doing, which hath no part of cooperation in his turnes with him, how farre that euer the ignorantes be abused in the contrarie. And as to the effectes of these two former partes, to wit, the consul­tationes and the outward meanes, they are so wounderfull as I dare not allege anie of them, without ioyning a sufficient reason of th e possibilitie thereof. For leauing all the small trifles among wiues, and to speake of the principall poyntes of their craft. For the common"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"256 APPENDIX A trifles thereof, they can do without conuerting well inough by them­selues: These principall poyntes I say are these: They can make men or women to laue or hate other, which may be verie possible to the Deuil to effectuat, seing he being a subtile spirite, knowes well in­ough how to perswade the corrupted affection of them whom God will permit him so to deale with: They can lay the siknesse of one vpon an other, which likewise is verie possible vnto him: For since by Gods permission, he layed siknesse vpon lOB, why may he not farre easilier lay it vpon any other: For as an old practisian, he knowes well inough what humor domines most in anie of vs, and as a spir­ite hee can subtillie walken vp the same, making it peccant, or to abounde, as he thinkes meete for troubling of vs, when God will so permit him. And for the taking off of it, no doubt he will be glad to reliue such of present paine, as he may thinke by these meanes to perswade to bee catched in his euerlasting snares and fetters. They can be-witch and take the life of men or women, by rosting of the Pictures, as I spake of before, which likewise is verie possible to their Master to performe, for although, (as I saide before) that instrumente of waxe haue no vertue in that turne doing, yet may hee not verie well euen by that same measure that his conjured slaues meltes that waxe at the fire, may he not I say at these same times, subtilie as a spirite so weaken and scatter the spirites of life of the patient, as may make him on th' one part, for faintnesse to sweate out the humour of his bodie: And on the other parte, for the not concurrence of these spirites, which causes his digestion, so debilitat his stomak, that his humour radicall continually, sweating out on the one parte, and no new good suck being put in the place thereof, for lack of digestion on the other, hee at last shall vanish awaie, euen as his picture will doe at the fire. And that knauish and cunning woorkeman, by troubling him onely at some times, makes a proportion so neare betuixt the woork­ing of the one and the other, that both shall ende as it were at one time.

They can make folkes to becom phrenticque or Ma­niacque, which likewise is very possible to their master to do, sence they are but naturall sicknesses: and so he may lay on these kindes, aswell as anie others. They can make spirites either to follow and trouble persones, or haunt certaine houses, and affraie oftentimes the inhabitantes: as hath bene knowen to be done by our Witches at this time. And likewise they can make some to be possessed with spirites, & so to becom verie D.emoniacques: and this last sorte is verie pos­sible likewise to the Deuill their Master to do, since he may easilie send his owne angells to trouble in what forme he pleases, any whom God wil permit him so to vse.

The other of them is become communer and more vsed sensine, I meane by their vnlawfull artes, whereupon our whole purpose hath bene. This we finde by experience in this Ile to be true. For as we know, moe Ghostes and spirites were seene, nor tongue can tell, in the time of blinde Papistrie in these Countries, where now by the contrarie, a man shall scarcely all his time here once of such things. And yet were these vnlawfull artes farre rarer at that time: and neuer were so much harde of, nor so rife as they are now. PHI. What should be the cause of that? EPI. The diuerse nature of our sinnes procures at the Justice of God, diuerse sortes of p unishments answering thereunto. And therefore as in the time of Papistrie, our fathers erring grosselie, & through ignorance, that mist of errours ouershaddowed the Deuill to walke the more familiarlie amongst them: And as it were by bar­nelie and affraying terroures, to mocke and accuse their barnelie er­roures. By the contrarie, we now being sounde of Religion, and in our life rebelling to our profession, God iustlie by that sinne of rebel­lion, as Samuel calleth it, accuseth our life so wilfullie fighting against our profession.

I Pray you now then go forward in telling what ye thinke fabulous, or may be trowed in that case. EPI. That kinde of the Deuils conuersing in the earth, may be diuided in foure different kindes, whereby he affrayeth and troubleth the bodies of men: Fo r of the abusing of the soule, I haue spoken alreadie. The first is, where spirites troubles some houses or solitarie places: The second, where spirites followes vpon certaine persones, and at diuers houres troubles them: The thirde, when they enter within them and possesse them: The fourth is these kinde of spirites that are called vulgarlie the Fayrie. Of the three former kindes, ye harde alreadie, how they may artificiallie be made by Witch-craft to trouble folke: Now it restes to speake of their naturall comming as it were, and not raysed by Witch-craft. But generally I must for-warne you of one thing before I enter in this purpose: that i s, that although in my discourseing of them, I deuyde them in diuers kindes, yee must notwithstanding there of note my Phrase of speaking in that: For doubtleslie they are in effect, but all one kinde of spirites, who for abusing the more of mankinde, takes on these sundrie shapes,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 265 and vses diuerse formes of out-ward actiones, as if some were of na­ture better then other. Nowe I returne to my purpose: As to the first kinde of these spirites, that were called by the auncients by diuers names, according as their actions were. For if they were spirites that haunted some houses, by appearing in diuers and horrible formes, and making greate dinne: they were called Lemures or Spectra. If they appeared in likenesse of anie defunct to some friends of his, they wer called vmbr.x mortuorum: And so innumerable stiles they got, ac­cording to their actiones, as I haue said alreadie. As we see by experi­ence, how manie stiles they haue given them in our language in the like maner: Of the appearing of these spirites, wee are certified by the Scriptures, where the Prophet ESAY 13. and 34. cap. [marginal gloss: Easy. 13 Jere. 50] threatning the destruction of Babell and Edam: declares, that it shal not onlie be wracked, but shall become so gre­ate a solitude, as it shall be the habitackle of Howlettes, and of ZIIM and liM, which are the proper Hebrewe names for these Spirites. The cause whie they haunte solitari e places, it is by reason, that they may affraie and brangle the more the faith of suche as them alone hauntes such places. For our nature is such, as in companies wee are not so soone mooued to anie such kinde of feare, as being solitare, which the Deuill knowing well inough, hee will not therefore assaile vs but when we are weake : And besides that, GOD will not permit him so to dishonour the societies and companies of Christians, as in publicke times and places to walke visiblie amongst them. On the other parte, when he troubles certaine houses that are dwelt in, it is a sure token either of grosse ignorance, or of some grosse and slan­derous sinnes amongst the inhabitantes thereof: which God by that extraordinarie rod punishes. PHI. But by what way or passage can these Spirites enter in these houses, seeing they alledge that they will enter, Doore and Window being steiked? EPI. They will choose the passage for their entresse, according to the forme that they are in at that time. For if they haue assumed"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"266 APPENDIX A a deade bodie, whereinto they lodge themselues, they can easely inough open without dinne anie Doore or Window, and enter in thereat. And if they enter as a spirite onelie, anie place where the aire may come in at, is large inough an entrie for them: For as I said before, a spirite can occupie no quantitie. PHI. And will God then permit these wicked spirites to trouble the reste of a dead bodie, before the resurrection thereof? Or if he will so, I thinke it should be of the reprobate onely. EPI. What more is the reste troubled of a dead bodie, when the Deuill carryes it out of the Graue to serue his turne for a space, nor when the Witches takes it vp and joyntes it, or when as Swine wortes vppe the graues? The rest of them that the Scripture speakes of, i s not meaned by a locall remaining continuallie in one place, but by their resting from their trauelles and miseries of this worlde, while their latter conjunction againe with the soule at that time to receaue full glorie in both. And that the Deuill may vse aswell the ministrie of the bodies of the faithfull in these cases, as of the vn­faithfull, there is no inconvenient; for his haunting with their bod­ies after they are deade, can no-waies defyle them: In respect of the soules absence. And for anie dishonour it can be vnto them, by what reason can it be greater, then the hanging, heading, or many such shameful deaths, that good men will suffer? for there i s nothing in the bodies of the faithfull, more worthie of honour, or freer from corruption by nature , nor in these of the vnfaithful, while time they be purged and glorified in the latter daie, as is dailie seene by the vilde diseases and corruptions, that the bodies of the faythfull are subject vnto, as yee will see clearelie proued, when I speake of the possessed and 0C£moniacques.

Yet there are sundrie that affirmes to haue haunted such places, where these spirites are alleaged to be: And coulde neuer heare nor see anie thing."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 267 EPI. I thinke well: For that is onelie reserued to the secreete knowledge of God, whom he wil permit to see such thinges, and whome not. PHI. But where these spirites hauntes and troubles anie houses, what is the best waie to banishe them? EPI. By two meanes may onelie the remeid of such things be procured: The one is ardent praye r to God, both of these persones that are troubled with them, and of that Church whereof they are . The other is the purging of themselues by amende ment of life from such sinnes, as haue procured that extraordinarie plague. PHI. And what meanes then these kindes of spirites, when they appeare in the shaddow of a person newlie dead, or to die, to his friendes? EPI. When they appeare vpon that occasion, they are called Wraithes in our language. Amongst the Gentiles the Deuill vsed that much, to make them beleeue that it was some good spirite that ap­peared to them then, ether to forewarne them of the death of their friend; or else to discouer vnto them, the will of the defunct, or what was the way of his slauchter, as is written in the booke of the histories Prodigious. And this way hee easelie decciued the Gentiles, because they knew not God: And to that same effect is it, that he now appeares in that maner to some ignorant Christians. For he dare not so illude anie that knoweth that, neither can the spirite of the defunct returne to his friend, or yet an Angell vse such formes. PHI. And are not our war-woolfes one sorte of these spirits also, that hauntes and troubles some houses or dwelling places? EPI. There bath indeede bene an old opinion of such like thinges; For by the Greekes they were called AUKavSpconot which signifi­eth men-woolfes. But to tell you simplie my opinion in this, if anie such thing hath bene, I take it to haue proceeded but of a naturall super-abundance of Melancholie, which as wee reade, that it hath made some thinke themselues Pitchers, and some horses, and some one kinde o f beast or other: So suppose I that it hath so viciat the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"268 APPENDIX A imagination and memorie of some, as per lucida interualla, it hath so highlie occupyed them, that they haue thought themselues ver­rie Woolfes indeede at these times: and so haue counterfeited their actiones in goeing on their handes and feete, preassing to deuoure women and barnes, fighting and snatching with all the towne dogges, and in v sing such like other bruitish actiones, and so to be­come beastes by a strong apprehension, as Nebucad-netzar was seuen yeares: [marginal gloss: Dan. 4.] but as to their hauing and hyding of their hard & schellie sloughes, I take that to be but eiked, by vncer­taine report, the author of alllyes.

That since all Prophecies and visiones are nowe ceased, all spirites that appeares in these fo rmes are euill. PHILO MATHES. COme forward now to the reste of these kindes of spirites. EPI. As to the next two kindes, that is, either these that outward­lie troubles and followes some persones, or else inwardlie possesses them: I will conjoyne them in one, because aswel the causes ar alike in the persons that they are permitted to trouble: as also the waies whereby they may be remedied and cured. PHI. What kinde of persones are they that vses to be so trou­bled? EPI. Two kindes in speciall: Either such as being guiltie of greeu­ous offences, God punishes by that horrible kinde of scourdge, or else being persones of the beste nature peraduenture , that ye e shall finde in all the Countrie about them, GOD permittes them to be troubled in that sort, for the tryall of their patience, and wakening vp of their zeale, for admonishing of the beholders, not to truste"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 269 ouer much in themselues, since they are made of no better stuffe, and peraduenture blotted with no smaller sinnes (as CHRIST saide, speaking of them vppon whome the Towre in Siloam fell:) [marginal gloss: Luc.13.] And for giuing likewise to the spectatators, matter to prayse GOD, that they meriting no better, are yet spared from being corrected in that fearefull forme. PHI. These are good reasones for the parte of GOD, which appa­rantlie mooues him so to permit the Deuill to trouble such persones. But since the Deuil hath euer a contrarie respecte in all the actiones that GOD employes him in: which is I pray you the end and mark he shoots at in this turne? EPI. It is to obtaine one of two thinges thereby, if he may: The one is the tinsell of their life, by inducing them to such perrilous places at such time as he either followes or possesses them, which may procure the same: And such like, so farre as GOD will permit him, by tormenting them to weaken their bodie, and caste them in incurable diseases. The other thinge that hee preases to obteine by troubling of them, is the tinsell of their Soule, by intising them to mistruste and blaspheme God: Either for the intollerablenesse of their tormentes, as he assayed to haue done with lOB; [marginal gloss: Iob.l.] or else for his promising vnto them to leaue the trou­bling of them, incase they would so do, as is knowen by experi­ence at this same time by the confession of a young one that was so troubled. PHI. Since ye haue spoken now of both these kindes of spir­ites comprehending them in one: I must nowe goe backe againe in speering some questions of euerie one of these kindes in speciall. And first for these that followes certaine persones, yee know that there are two sortes o f them: One sorte that troubles and tormentes the persones that they haunt with: An other sort that are seruice­able vnto them in all kinde of their necessaries, and omittes neuer to forwarne them of anie suddaine perrell that they are to be in. And so in this case, I would vnderstande whither both these sortes be but"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"270 APPENDIX A wicked and damned spirites: Or if the last sorte be rather Angells, (as should appeare by their actiones) sent by God to assist such as he speciallie fauoures. For i t is written in the Scriptures, that God sendes Legions of Angells to guarde and watch ouer his elect. [marginal gloss: Gen.32. 1Kin.6 Psal.34.] EPI. I know well inough where fra that errour which ye alleage hath proceeded: For it was the ignorant Gentiles that were the foun­taine thereof. Who for that they knew not God, they forged in their owne imaginationes, euery man to be still accompanied with two spirites, whereof they called the one genius bonus, the other genius malus: the Greekes called them Evoaq.tova & KaKooaq.wva: wherof the former they saide, perswaded him to all the good he did: the other entised him to all the euill. But praised be God we that are christians, & walks not amongst the Cymmerian conjectures of man, knowes well inough, that i t is the good spirite of God onely, who is the fountain of all goodnes, that perswads vs to the thinking or doing of any good: and that it is our corrupted fleshe and Sathan, that intiseth vs to the contrarie. And yet the Deuill for confirming in the heades of ignoraunt Christians, that errour first mainteined among the Gentiles, he whiles among the first kinde of spirits that I speak of, appeared in time of Papistrie and blindnesse, and haunted diuers houses, without doing any euill, but doing as it were necessa­rie turnes vp and down the house: and this spirit they called Brownie in our language, who appeared like a rough-man: yea, some were so blinded, as to beleeue that their house was all the sonsier, as they called it, that such spirites resorted there. PHI. But since the Deuils intention in all his actions, is euer to do euill, what euill was there in that forme of doing, since their actions outwardly were good. EPI. Was it not euill inough to deceiue simple ignorantes, in making them to take him for an Angell of light, and so to account of Gods enemie, as of their particular friend: where by the contra­rie, all we that are Christians, ought assuredly to know that since the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 271 comming of Christ in the flesh, and establishing of his Church by the Apostles, all miracles, visions, prophecies, & appearances of Angels or good spirites are ceased.

CHAP III. ARGV. The description of a particular sort of that kind of fo llowing spirites, called Incubi and Succubi: And what is the reason wherefo re these kindes of spirites hauntes most the Northerne and barbarous partes of the world. PHILOMATHES. THE next question that I would speere , is likewise concerning this first of these two kindes of spirites that ye haue conjoyned: and it is this; ye knowe how it is commonly written and reported, that amongst the re st of the sortes of spirites that followes certaine per­sons, there is one more monstrous nor al the rest: in respect as it is alleaged, they converse naturally with them whom they trouble and hauntes with: and therefore I would knowe in two thinges your opinion herein: First if suche a thing can be: and next if it be: whether there be a difference of sexes amongst these spirites or not. EPI. That abhominable kinde of the Deuils abusing of men or women, was called of old, Incubi and Succubi, according to the dif­fe rence of the sexes that they conuersed with. By two meanes this great kinde of abuse might possibly be performed: The one, when the Deuill onelie as a spirite, and stealing out the sperme of a dead bodie, abuses them that way, they not graithlie seeing anie shape or feeling anie thing, but that which he so conuayes in that part: As"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"272 APPENDIX A we reade of a Monasterie of Nunnes which were burnt for their being that way abused. The other meane is when he borrowes a dead bodie and so visiblie, and as it seemes vnto them naturallie as a man converses with them. But it is to be noted, that in whatsoeuer way he vseth it, that sperme seemes intollerably cold to the person abused. For if he steale out the nature of a quick person, it cannot be so quicklie carryed, but it will both tine the strength and heate by the way, which it could neuer haue had for lacke of agitation, which in the time of procreation is the procurer & wakener vp of these two natural qualities. And if he occupying the dead bodie as his lodging expell the same out thereof in the dewe time, it must likewise be colde by the participation with the qualities of the dead bodie whereout of it comes. And whereas yee inquire if these spir­ites be diuided in sexes or not, I thinke the rules of Philosophie may easelie resolue a man of the contrarie: For it is a sure principle of that arte, that nothing can be diuided in sexes, except such liuing bodies as must haue a naturall seede to genere by. But we know spir­ites hath no seede proper to themselues, nor yet can they gender one with an other. PHI. How is it then that they say sundrie monsters haue bene gotten by that way. EPI. These tales are nothing but A niles fa bulce. For that they haue no nature of their owne, I haue shewed you alreadie. And that the cold nature of a dead bodie, can woorke nothing in generation, it is more nor plaine, as being already dead of it selfe as well as the rest of the bodie is, wanting the naturall heate, and such other naturall operation, as is necessarie for woorking that effect, and incase such a thing were possible (which were all utterly against all the rules of na­ture) it would bread no monster, but onely such a naturall of-spring, as would haue cummed betuixt that man or woman and that other abused person, in-case they both being aliue had had a doe with other. For the Deuilles parte therein, is but the naked carrying or expelling of that substance: And so it coulde not participate with no"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 273 qualitie of the same. Indeede, it is possible to the craft of the Deuill to make a womans bellie to swel after he hath that way abused her, which he may do, either by steiring vp her own humor, or by her­bes, as we see beggars daily doe. And when the time of her deliuery should come to make her thoil great doloures, like vnto that naturall course, and then subtillie to slippe in the Mid-wiues handes, stockes, stones, or some monstruous barne brought from some other place, but this is more reported and gessed at by others, nor beleeued by me. PHI. But what is the cause that this kinde of abuse is thought to be most common in such wild partes of the worlde, as Lap-land, and Fin-land, or in our North lies of Orknay and Schet-land. EPI. Because where the Deuill findes greatest ignorance and bar­baritie, there assayles he grosseliest, as I gaue you the reason where­fore there was moe Witches of women kinde nor men. PHI. Can anie be so vnhappie as to giue their willing consent to the Deuilles vilde abusing them in this forme. EPI. Yea, some of the Witches haue confessed, that he hath per­swaded them to giue their willing consent thereunto, that he may thereby haue them feltred the sikarer in his snares; But as the other compelled sorte is to be pittied and prayed for, so is this most highlie to be punished and detested. PHI. It is not the thing which we cal the Mare, which takes fol­kes sleeping in their bedds, a kinde of these spirites, whereof ye are speaking? EPI.

WEL, I haue told you now all my doubts, and ye haue satisfied me therein, concerning the first of these two kindes of spirites that ye haue conjoyned. Now I am to inquire onely two thinges at you con­cerning the last kinde, I meane the O<emoniackes. The first is, whereby shal these possessed folks be discerned fra them that ar trubled with a natural Phrensie or Manie. The next is, how can it be that they can be remedied by the Papistes Church, whome wee counting as Hereticques, it should appeare that one Deuil should not cast out an other, for then would his kingdome be diuided in it selft, as CHRIST said. [marginal gloss: Mat. 12 Mark. 3] EPI. As to your first question; there are diuers symptomes, whereby that heauie trouble may be discerned from a naturall sicke­nesse, and speciallie three, omitting the diuers vaine signes that the Papistes attributes vnto it: Such as the raging at holie water, their fleeing a back from the Cro ce, their not abiding the hearing of God named, and innumerable such like vaine thinges that were alike fash­ious and feckles to recite. But to come to these three symptomes then, whereof I spake, I account the one of them to be the incred­ible strength of the possessed creature , which will farre exceede the strength of six of the wightest and wodest of any other men that are not so troubled. The next is the boldning vp so far of the patients breast and bellie, with such an vnnaturall sturring and vehement agi­tation within them: And such an ironie hardnes of his sinnowes so stiffelie bended out, that it were not possible to prick out as it were the skinne of anie other person so far: so mightely works the Deuil in all the members and senses of his body, he being locallie within the same, suppose of his Soule and affectiones thereof, hee haue no"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 275 more power then of any other mans. The last is, the speaking of sundrie languages, which the patient is knowen by them that were acquainte with him neuer to haue learned, and that with an vncouth and hollowe voice, and al the time of his speaking, a greater mo­tion being in his breast then in his mouth . But fra this last symptome is excepted such, as are altogether in the time of their possessing bereft of al their senses being possessed with a dumme and blynde spirite, whereof Christ releiued one, in the 12. Of Mathew. And as to your next demande, it is first to be doubted if the Papistes or anie not professing the the onelie true Religion, can relieue anie of that trouble. And next, in-case they can, vpon what respectes it is pos­sible vnto them. As to the former vpon two reasons, it is grounded: first that it is knowen so manie of them to bee counterfite, which wyle the Clergie inuentes for confirming of their rotten Religion. The next is, that by experience we finde that few, who are possessed indeede, are fullie cured by them: but rather the Deuill is content to release the bodelie hurting of them, for a shorte space, thereby to obteine the perpetual hurt of the soules of so many that by these false miracles may be induced or confirmed in the profession of that erroneous Religion: euen as I told you before that he doth in the false cures, or casting off of diseases by Witches. As to the other part of the argument in-case they can, which rather (with reuerence of the learned thinking otherwaies) I am induced to beleeue, by reason of the faithfull report that men sound of religion, haue made ac­cording to their sight thereof, I think if so be, I say these may be the respectes, whereupon the Papistes may haue that power. CHRIST gaue a commission and power to his Apostles to cast out Deuilles, which they according thereunto put in execution: The rules he had them obserue in that action, was fasting and praier: & the action it selfe to be done in his name. This powe r of theirs proceeded not then of anie vertue in them, but onely in him who directed them. As was clearly proued by Iudas his hauing as greate power in that com­mission, as anie of the reste. It is easie then to be vnderstand that the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"276 APPENDIX A casting out of Deuilles, is by the vertue of fasting and prayer, and in-calling of the name of God, suppose manie imperfectiones be in the person that is the instrumente, as CHRIST him selfe teacheth vs [marginal gloss: Mat. 7.] of the power that false Prophets sall haue to caste out Devils. It is no wounder then, these respects of this ac­tion being considered, that it may be possible to the Papistes, though erring in sundrie points of Religion to accomplish this, if they vse the right forme prescribed by CHRIST herein. For what the worse is that action that they erre in other thinges, more then their Baptisme is the worse that they erre in the other Sacrament, and haue eiked many vaine freittes to the Baptisme it selfe. PHI. Surelie it is no little wonder that God should permit the bodies of anie of the faithfull to be so dishonoured, as to be a dwell­ing place to that vncleane spirite. EPI. There is it which I told right now, would prooue and strengthen my argument of the deuils entring in the dead bodies of the faithfull. For if he is permitted to enter in their liuing bod­ies, euen when they are ioyned with the soule: how much more will God permit him to enter in their dead carions, which is no more man, but the filthie and corruptible caise of man. For as CHRIST sayth, It is not any thing that enters within man that defiles him, but onely that which proceedes and commeth out of him. [marginal gloss: Mark. 7.] CHAP. V. ARGV.

That fourth kinde of spirites, which by the Gentiles was called Diana, and her wandring Court, and amongst vs was called"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 277 the Phairie (as I tould you) or our good neighboures, was one of the sortes of illusiones that was rifest in the time of Papistrie: for although it was holden odious to Prophesie by the deuill, yet whome these kinde of Spirites carryed awaie, and informed, they were thought to be sonsiest and of best life. To speake of the many vaine trattles founded vpon that illusion: How there was a King and Queene of Phairie, of such a iolly court & train as they had, how they had a teynd, & dutie, as it were, of all goods: how they natu­rallie rode and went, eate and drank, and did all other actiones like naturall men and women: I thinke it liker VIRGILS Campi Elysij, nor anie thing that ought to be beleeued by Christians, except in gener­al!, that as I spake sundrie times before, the deuil illuded the senses of sundry simple creatures, in making them beleeue that they saw and harde such thinges as were nothing so indeed. PHI. But how can it be then, that sundrie Witches haue gone to death with that confession, that they haue ben transported with the Phairie to such a hill, which opening, they went in, and there saw a faire Queene, who being now lighter, gaue them a stone that had sundrie vertues, which at sundrie times hath bene produced in judgement? EPI. I say that, euen as I said before of that imaginar rauishing of the spirite foorth of the bodie. For may not the deuil object to their fantasie, their senses being dulled, and as it were a sleepe, such hilles & houses within them, such glistering courts and traines, and what­soeuer such like wherewith he pleaseth to delude them. And in the meane time their bodies being senselesse, to conuay in their hande any stone or such like thing, which he makes them to imagine to haue receiued in such a place. PHI. But what say ye to their fore-telling the death of sundrie persones, whome they alleage to haue seene in these places? That is, a sooth-dreame (as they say) since they see it walking. EPI. I thinke that either they haue not bene sharply inough exam­ined, that gaue so blunt a reason for their Prophesie, or otherwaies,"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"278 APPENDIX A I thinke it likewise as possible that the Deuill may prophesie to them when he deceiues their imaginationes in that sorte, as well as when he plainely speakes vnto them at other times for their prophesying, is but by a kinde of vision, as it were, wherein he commonly coun­terfeits God among the Ethnicks, as I told you before. PHI. I would know now whether these kindes of spirites may only appeare to Witches, or if they may also appeare to anie other. EPI. They may do to both, to the innocent sort, either to affraie them, or to seeme to be a better sorte of folkes nor vncleane spirites are, and to the Witches, to be a cullour of safetie for them, that ig­norant Magistrates may not punish them for it, as I told euen now. But as the one sorte, for being perforce troubled with them ought to be pittied, so ought the other sorte (who may bee discerned by their taking vppon them to Prophesie by them,) That sorte I say, ought as seuerely to be punished as any other Witches, and rather the more, that that they goe dissemblingly to woorke. PHI. And what makes the spirites haue so different names from others. EPI. Euen the knauerie of that same deuil; who as hee illudes the Necromancers with innumerable feyned names for him and his angels, as in special, making Sathan, Beelzebub, & Lucife r, to be three sundry spirites, where we finde the two former, but diuers names giuen to the Prince of all the rebelling angels by the Scripture . As by CHRIST, the Prince of all the Deuilles is called, Beelzebub in that place, which I alleaged against the power of any hereticques to cast out Deuils. By JOHN in the Reuelation, the old tempter is called, Sathan the Prince of all the euill angels. And the last, to wit, Lucifer, is but by allegorie taken from the day Starre (so named in diuers places of the Scriptures) because of his excellencie (I meane the Prince of them) in his creation before his fall. Euen so I say he deceaues the Witches, by attributing to himselfe diuers names: as if euery diuers shape that he trans formes himselfe in, were a diuers kinde of spirit."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 279 PHI. But I haue hard many moe strange tales of this Phairie, nor ye haue yet told me. EPI. As well I do in that, as I did in all the rest of my discourse. For because the ground of this conference of ours, proceeded of your speering at me at our meeting, if there was such a thing as Witches or spirites: And if they had any power: I therefore haue framed my whole discours, only to proue that such things are and may be, by such number of examples as I show to be possible by reason: & keepes me from dipping any further in playing the part of a Dictionarie, to tell what euer I haue read or harde in that purpose, which both would exceede fayth, and rather would seeme to teach such vnlawfull artes, nor to disallow and condemne them, as it is the duetie of all Christians to do. CHAP. VI. ARGV. Of the tryall and punishment of Wi tches. What sorte of accusation ought to be admitted against them. What is the cause of the increasing so fa r of their number in this age. PHILOMATHES. THEN To make an ende of our conference, since I see it drawes late, what forme of punishment thinke ye merites these Magicians and Witches? For I see that ye account them to be all alike guiltie? EPI. They ought to be put to death according to the Law of God, the ciuill and imperial law, and municipalllaw of all Christian na­tions. PHI. But what kinde of death I pray you? EPI. It is commonly vsed by fire, but that is an indifferent thing to be vsed in euery cuntrie, according to the Law or custome thereof. PHI. But ought no sexe, age nor ranck to be exempted?"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"280 APPENDIX A EPI. None at al (being so vsed by the lawful Magistrate) for it is the highest poynt of Idolatrie, wherein no exception is admitted by the law of God. PHI. Then bairnes may not be spared? EPI. Yea, not a haire the lesse of my conclusion. For they are not that capable of reason as to practise such thinges. And for any being in company and not reueiling thereof, their Jesse and ignorant age will no doubt excuse them. PHI. I see ye condemne them all that are of the counsell of such craftes. EPI. No doubt, for as I said, speaking of Magie, the consulters, trusters in, ouer-seers, interteiners or sturrers vp of these craftes­folkes, are equallie guiltie with themselues that are the practisers. PHI. Whether may the Prince then, or supreame Magistrate, spare or ouer-see any that are guiltie of that craft? vpon som great respects knowen to him? EPI. The Prince or Magistrate for further tryals cause, may con­tinue the punishing of them such a certaine space as he thinkes conuenient: But in the end to spare the life, and not to strike when God bids strike, and so seuerelie punish in so odious a fault & trea­son against God, it is not only vnlawful, but doubtlesse no Jesse sinne in that Magistrate, nor it was in SAYLES sparing of AGAG [marginal gloss: I. Sam. 15.]. And so comparable to the sin of Witch­craft it selfe, as SAMVELL alleaged at that time. PHI. Surely then, I think since this crime ought to be so seuerely punished. Judges ought to beware to condemne any, but such as they are sure are guiltie, neither should the clattering reporte of a earling serue in so weightie a case. EPI. Judges ought indeede to beware whome they condemne: For it is as great a crime (as SALOMON sayeth,) To condemne the in­nocent, as to let the guiltie escape free; [marginal gloss: Pro. 17.] neither ought the report of any one infamous person, be admitted for a suf­ficient proofe, which can stand of no law."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A 281 PHI. And what may a number then of guilty persons confessions, woork against one that is accused? EPI. The assise must serue for interpretour of our law i n that respect. But in my opinion, since in a mater of treason against the Prince, barnes or wiues, or neuer so diffamed persons, may of our law serue for sufficient witnesses and proofes. I thinke surely that by a far greater reason, such witnesses may be sufficient in matters of high treason against God: For who but Witches can be prooues, and so witnesses of the doings of Witches. PHI. Indeed, I trow they wil be loath to put any honest man vpon their counsell. But what if they accuse folke to haue bene pres­ent at their Imaginar conuentiones in the spirite, when their bodies !yes sencelesse, as ye haue said. EPI. I think they are not a haire the Jesse guiltie: For the Deuill durst neuer haue borrowed their shaddow or similitude to that turne, if their consent had not bene at it: And the consent in these turnes is death of the law. PHI. Then SAMVEL was a Witch: For the Deuill resembled his shape, and played his person in giuing response to SAVLE. EPI. SAMVEL was dead aswell before that; and so none coulde slander him with medli ng in that vnlawfull arte. For the cause why, as I take it, that God w ill not permit Sathan to vse the shapes or simil itudes of any innocent persones at such vnlawful times, is that God wil not permit that any innocent persons shalbe slandered with that vile defection: for then the deuil would find waies anew, to ca­lumniate the best. And this we haue in proofe by them that are car­ryed with the Phairie, who neuer see the shaddowes of any in that courte, but of them that thereafter are tryed to haue bene breth­ren and sisters of that craft. And this was likewise proued by the confession of a young Lasse, troubled with spirites, !aide on her by Witchcraft. That although shee saw the shapes of diuerse men & women troubling her, and naming the persons whom these shad­dawes represents: yet neuer one of them are found to be innocent,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"282 APPENDIX A but al clearely tried to be most guilty, & the most part of them con­fessing the same. And besides that, I think it hath ben seldome harde tell of, that any whome persones guiltie of that crime accused, as hauing knowen them to be their marrowes by eye-sight, and not by hear-say, but such as were so accused of Witch-craft, could not be clearely tryed vpon them, were at the least publickly knowen to be of a very euillife & reputation: so iealous is God I say, of the fame of them that are innocent in such causes. And besides that, there are two other good helpes that may be vsed for their trial: the one is the fi nding of their marke , and the trying the insensiblenes thereof. The other is their fleeting on the water: for as in a secret murther, if the deade carcase be at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it wil gush out of bloud, as if the blud wer crying to the heauen for reuenge of the murtherer. God hauing appoynted that secret super­naturall signe, for tryall of that secrete vnnaturall crime, so it ap­peares that God hath appoynted (for a super-naturall signe of the monstruous impietie of the Witches) that the water shal refuse to receiue them in her bosom, that haue shaken off them the sacred Water of Baptisme, and wilfullie refused the benefite there of: No not so much as their eyes are able to shed teares (thretten and tor­ture them as ye please) while first they repent (God not permitting them to dissemble their obstinacie in so horrible a crime) albeit the women kinde especially, be able other-waies to shed te ares at euery light occasion when they will, yea, although it were dissemblingly like the Crocodiles.

Well, wee haue made this conference to last as long as Iea­sure would permit: And to conclude then, since I am to take my leaue of you, I pray God to purge this Cuntrie of these diuellishe practises: for they were neuer so rife in these partes, as they are now.

The history of the civil witchcraft laws in England began with the statute of 1542, passed under the reign of King Henry VIII. This statute was found to be unenforceable and was repealed in 1547. In 1563 Eliz­abeth brought the witchcraft laws back onto the books in a form somewhat more severe than had existed so briefly under the rule of her father. However, they were not severe enough for James, who, if he had been allowed free action in drafting the new statute, would probably have made every act of magic or witchcraft punishable by death.

According to its editor, G. B. Harrison, these works are \"reprinted line for line and page for page\" from the original 16th century texts. The Bodley Head edition was published jointly by John Lane the Bodley Head Ltd., London, and by E. P. Dut­ton and Company, New York. All of the woodcuts used to illustrate this book were selected from the same historical period during which the book was writ­ten, as nearly as this was possible. Where necessary for clarity I have cleaned and enhanced the images, but their contents have not been altered. Illustrations 1, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 are to be found in the 1924 Bodley Head edition of King James the First Daemonologie, pub­lished by John Lane the Bodley Head Ltd., London, and E. P. Dutton, New York, in 1924. Illustrations 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 are to be found in Picture Book of Devils, Demons and Witchcraft by Ernst and Johanna Leh­ner, published by Dover Publications in 1971. Illustration 2 is to be found in the first volume (p. 597) of Hein­rich Cornelius Agrippa's two volume collection of works, Opera omnia, which bears no date but was first published around the year 1600. This Latin work was reproduced in facsimile in two volumes by Georg Olms Verlag of Hildesheim and New York in 1970. Illustration 4 is found on p. 244 of the Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot, first published 1584. The 1972 Dover Publications edi­tion is a reprint of the 1930 edition of John Rodker, London. Illustration 12 is from Olaus Magnus's Historia de gentibus sep­tentrionalibus, 15 55. It is reproduced on the second unnumbered plate following page 200 of A Treasury of Witchcraft by Harry E. Wedeck, published in 1961 by Philosophical Library, New York. 328"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Illustration 19 is found on page 131 of the second volume of Charles Mackay ' s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in its Third Edition in 1856 by G. Routledge & Co., London. Mackay derived it fr om page 26 of the fi rst volume of the Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere by Charles Knight, published in 8 volumes in 1839. Knight's version is a redrawing of a woodcut in the Praxis criminis p ersequendi by Mil­laeus, published at Paris in 1541. This woodcut appears as the fifth plate fo llowing page 128 of Daniel P. Mannix's The History of Tor­ture, published in 1964 by Dell Publishing Company, New York. Illustration 20 forms the title p age of the first edition of Newes from Scotland, published in 1592 (not 1591 even though this date appears on the page). It is to be fo und on the Internet at the Web site of Edward H. Thompson (http: I /homepages.tesco. net/ �eandcthomp/newes.htm), and on several other Internet sites."}]
