Shall we divulge the things not to be divulged? Shall we pronounce the things not to be pronounced?\" -Julian, Hymn to the Mother of the Gods Introduction This is the second volume of the series of Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magic. Like the first volume, and also the earlier Source Works of Mediaeval and Renaissance Magic series published by Askin Publishers in the mid seventies, it seeks to push back the frontiers of understanding about the actual techniques of ceremonial magic, and to clear away many misconceptions which have built up around magic in general over the last few hundred years, particularly since its deflection from its mainstream course late in the 19th century and its New Age accretions of the late 20th century. Our interest and emphasis is upon practice, technique, and results. If it doesn't work then it is not worth pursuing, but if it does work then it is worth pursuing thoroughly. The practice of magic, which is thousands of years old, deserves every bit as scrupulous research as the practice of physics or chemistry began to receive just 400 years ago. Our first volume provided a complete transcription of John Dee's most important Book of Invocations or Calls, kept by him in Latin in his most secret drawer, which was not opened till 54 years after his death, and which was subsequently translated into English, expanded tenfold, copied, re-copied, and then used by most of the important English angel magicians of the 17th-19th centuries. This, our second volume, is concerned with no less than three very important magical texts. Their importance can partly be judged by the number of times they were copied and recopied, and because they formed a key part of the core texts used by a magical group which formed round Dr Thomas Rudd, a 17th century angel magician and geometer of considerable skill. The Three Main Texts The manuscript items transcribed in this volume are: 1. Janua Magica Reserata, literally the 'Keys to the Gateway of Magic.' The prime source of this text is Sloane MS 3825. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic The first reaction of any modern reader to the first part of this book will be one of boredom at the mass of pious sentiment and the discussions on the nature of man's soul. In the days when this was written, such a preliminary would have been considered perfectly natural, but also it may have been a piece of insurance, as interest in magic (even angel magic) could easily get one into trouble with the ecclesiastical authorities. However persevere, and gradually the writer turns from piousness to practical advice. In the section entitled the 8th 'Beneficial Aphorisms' the writer lists the spiritual creatures that can be constrained to serve the magician as \"all creatures, both Divine, Super-celestial, Olympic, Terrestrial, Sub-terrestrial, Airy, Watery, & infernal, visible and invisible, to yield due obedience, with all readiness & submission unto us.» Most importantly, he warns the magician never to mix together experiments concerned with different types of spiritual creature. The 18th Aphorism outlines the doctrine of the 'chain of command' which functions via correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm, explaining that the inferior interacts with the superior as, \"those inferiors (as herbs, stones, metals &c) have their power subservient to the Heavens, the Heavens from the Intelligences, and the Intelligences from God, in whom all things persist in the greatest power; as in the Little world [of] Man [the microcosm], there is not a member for which hath no Correspondence with some Intelligence, Element, plant, &c; and in some measure & numeration, in the Archetype [the macrocosm].\" Aristotle used the word 'Intelligences' almost as a synonym for 'angel', and saw them as regulating the sphere or orbs of Heaven. The section 'Of Angels & Spirits' gets more practical. I would recommend you begin to read this book at this point, if it is at all likely that you may find the three prior sections a little too heavy going for your taste. This section begins with an explanation of the bodies of angels which are said to be mostly drawn from the Element of Air with a small admixture of Fire. Each angel has a specific rulers hip in space and time, and each angel is assigned to a specific position in the hierarchy of the Nine Orders of angels or planetary spheres, a theme that is taken up later in the Invocations. In the section 'A Brief Summary' the detailed division of the heavens and orbs amongst both angels and 'spirits of darkness' draws on the concept of the angels of the four quarters and Kings, Keepers, Seniors and watchmen of the watchtowers, and subservient angels, a hierarchy similar to that used by Dr. John Dee, and learned from the Angel Ave. In the section 'Observations upon the Foregoing' the 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic author considers the position of one's Evil Angel and how it may be a counterpoise to the Guardian Angel. The next section 'Of the Nine, or Orders of Celestial Angels' begins with a very concentrated summary of the correspondences of the Tree of Life, and a table showing the Kabbalistic correspondences of each of the ten Sephiroth, with godname, order of angels (Hebrew and English), governing angel or Intelligence, presiding angel, planetary or celestial spheres, and the orders of evil or powers of the Infernal World listed as a counterbalance to the foregoing. Sigils are given for each of the angels of the nine Orbs. In this section we have left the spelling of the Sephiroth and angels as it appears in the manuscript rather than changing it to the more currently accepted spelling. There are a lot of differences between variant manuscripts and so this section is peppered with footnotes, but its essence lies in the table printed at the front of the section. The concept of Nine Choirs or grades of angels and of Guardian angels has deep roots going back to pre-Christian times. We can trace the transmission of this knowledge from Aristotle's 'Intelligences'to neo-Platonists like Porphyry through Iamblichus of Chalcis (c.245-c.325 AD), founder of the Syrian school of neo-Platonists, who wrote the important magical and mystical text On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians to Proclus (c.410-485 AD) who wrote on it in De Magica and Elements of Theology. His work was used in turn by pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (c.500 AD) whose Celestial Hierarchies dealt with the angelic hierarchies in great detail, and established that there were Nine Hierarchies. His work was later translated in the 9th century by the Irishman John Scotus Erigena and commented on in his principal work De Divisione Naturae. From there the hierarchy of angels entered the theology taught at the new Universities of the day, and more practically became part of the emerging grimoires, with a matching hierarchy of demons. The present section on 'The Celestial Hierarchies' concentrates upon the different orders of angels from Seraphim down to the least angel, including the doctrine that individual countries have angels appointed to rule their destiny, a concept that was outlined Agrippa and which fascinated Dr. John Dee who expanded it in his Liber Scientiae, Auxilii, et Victoriae Terrestris. The Section 'Names of the Celestial Angels or Sacred Intelligences, set over & Governing the Seven Planets' is replete with many tables showing the relationship of angels, planets, various hierarchies, Olympic spirit, Element, zodiacal sign, planet, direction or function. The first table shows the all important relationship between the seven planets and the seven main angels. The several sets of 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic correspondences between the angels and the 12 zodiacal signs are complemented by the angelic names for each of the 28 Mansions of the Moon. The 72 angels of the Shemhamphoras are also given, and these have a very practical significance which will be explained in the next Volume of this series. The section following 'Of the Hierarchies or Orders of Evil Spirits' gives the equivalent and balancing details of the nine Orders of evil angels or demons, giving their particular order, functions, and degree. It concludes with the names of the four governors of the four quarters, the Demon Princes, Oriens, Paymon, Egin, and Amaymon, who we will meet again in the third Part of this Volume where they are used as names of compulsion in invocations. The hierarchy includes a strange but interesting mixture of old gods like Apollyon, Abaddon and Beelzebub, various Biblical orders of fallen angels (such as Revengers, Tempters, Ensnarers, Deceivers) and spirits like Meririm, prince of the aerial powers. Most importantly it lists the four Demon Princes, Oriens, Paymon, Egin, and Amaymon. In the section 'Of Angels Good and Bad Their Degrees and Offices' we look at a classical views of demons from Thomas Aquinas to Psellus. This section goes into detail over the different kinds of angels and demons. There are two very interesting anecdotes here. The first is a detailed description of the precise technique for using 'water' in weather magic. The second is a strange story about a boy apparently abducted by demons as the result of a curse, who was returned the following morning in a very sorry state. The qualities of the spirits of each of the four Elements, or Elementals, and finally the spirits or demons who reside in Hell, charged with the task of tormenting the damned, are outlined. 'Of Incubi and Succubi' draws interesting parallels between them and the Satyrs and Fauns. The section following on the 'Power and Authority that Necromancers and Witches Have over the Devil' begins with a rehearsal of the differences between lawful Natural Magic and Demonic Magic. Natural Magic here includes such things as magic wrought by the burial of certain images. The second kind of magic is associated with the magicians of Pharaoh and Simon Magus. Even Christ's miracles are mentioned as a form of magic utilising a particular demon, in this case Beelzebub. A short section on poltergeists or 'domes tical' spirits follows which associates this phenomenon with hobgoblins and fairy folk like 'Robin Goodfellow'. Using Latin titles, the section 'Of the Orders of Wicked Demons' looks at the categorisation of demons into nine Orders or 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Hierarchies. One of the most interesting passages in this section states: \"Other divines say that no Demons were created wicked but were cast down from the Heavens from the Orders of good Angels, for their prevarication, as all Hebrew divines, Assyrian, Arabian and Egyptian do confirm. Phererides the Syrian describes the fall of Demons, and Ophin, that is a Serpent Demoniac, that was the head of the rebellious army.\" This is a key passage and confirms the identity of demons as simply fallen angels, essentially the same kind of creature as angels. The last sentence may be a reference to the serpent related Nephilim.l In this section, for the first and only time Diabolos is mentioned. It should be noted that it is Diabolos alone who should have been translated as 'the Devil' in the Bible, which is quite a different word from 'demon'. Diabolos is strangely listed as one of the eighth Order. It is hard to see why the supreme adversary should be so demoted. 'Of the Bodies of Demons' quotes various, mostly Biblical authorities, on the nature of the bodies of both angels and demons. The prevalent opinion was that their bodies were made of the Elements of air and fire. An interesting sidelight is thrown upon the relationship between angels and demons, where the Book of Tobit is quoted as showing how the angel Raphael was able to control the demon Asmodeus. The last section, 'Some further Considerations ... of this Subject touching Spirits' goes deeper into the nature of demonic and angelic bodies, considerations which are important when looking to manifest either of these to visible appearance. This section also contains a more complete list of the different type of spiritual creatures and where traditionally they may be found, including Fairies, Hobgoblins, Elfs, Naiads, Potamides, Nymphs, Oreads, Hamedes, Dryads, Hamadryads, Satyrs, Sylvani, Napta, Agapta, Dodona, Palea, Feniliae, Gnomi, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders. The Gnomes were particularly significant as being supposed to be in command of or aware of buried treasure. 2. Dr Rudd's Nine Hierarchies of Angels with their Invocations to Visible Appearance with the Nine Great Celestial Keys, or Angelical Invocations. This Part is a core magical text, concerned from the beginning with practical considerations. This Part is preceded by two separate Introductions, which cover similar ground. The first Introduction 1 See Andrew Collins From the Ashes of Angels: The Forbidden Legacy of a Fallen Race, Signet, 1997 for speculation on the fallen 'sons of God'. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic very clearly explains what happens just before the materialisation of a spirit or angel, indeed the description is like the opening o~ many of Dr John Dee's actions with spirits: \"the sign of their appearance, most seemeth like a Veil or Curtain of some beautiful Colour, hanging in or about the stone, or Glass, as a bright Cloud, or other pretty kind of Hieroglyphical show, both strange & yet very Delightful to behold.» This is followed by very clear instructions as to what sort of skrying stone should be used and how it should be mounted. I think that this is probably the clearest description anywhere in print of the precise type and mounting of a shew stone or glass spirit receptacle. These instructions would have been taken for granted by Dr John Dee, and were copied out two hundred years later by Frederick Hockley. It also clearly shows that the stone should be lit by either two wax candles either side or an oil lamp behind. The main content follows with a 'Key' or Invocation for the main angels of each of the Nine Hierarchies of angels. Each Key is followed by a 'Replication', an invocation to be used if the first Key has not quite done the job. This section reiterates the advice that invocations for just one type of spiritual creature at a time should be undertaken, and that in no way should you mix up actions Celestial, Elemental & Infernal operations. An important part of this Introduction explains how to tell Benevolent Angels, & other Elemental spirits or powers of Light, from those that are Infernal or spirits of Darkness. This hinges primarily upon appearance, so that spirits of the latter category will betray some form of ugliness or grossness of body, deportment or speech, whilst the former type will be courteous, friendly and 'well favoured' or good looking. This may seem superficial, but the Introduction goes on to show how you can check these initial impressions with specific questions and challenges which cause intruding spirits to vanish, leaving just those spiritual creatures specifically called. Detailed instruction as to how to detect and deal with unwanted intrusions is given. The Second Introduction gives much the same instructions, and it is followed by 'A Prayer to be said before the moving & Calling forth any of the Celestial Intelligences, to Visible appearance' and a list of which angels are set over each of the nine planetary orbs. 3. The Demon Princes This section is not so much about the conjuration of the four Demon Princes as conjuration by the Demon Princes, using their names to 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic enforce the obedience of lesser servitor spirits. Many of the spirits named in these conjurations are unique, or at least not commonly found in other magical texts, except the Heptameron. Using these Invocations Specific speeches of welcome to the spirits are included in Part 2, and the form for interacting with the spiritual creatures so invoked is specified in considerable detail. Phrases such as \"the true servants & worshippers of the same your God\" show very clearly a continuity of method, and echoes a phrase found in Dee's Enochian. In fact it is highly significant that methods, and even specific wording used successfully to invoke spirits, remains constant and unchanged over centuries, as used by Trithemius circa 1500, by Dr John Dee circa 1600, by Dr Rudd and Peter Smart circa 1700, by Francis Barrett circa 1800 and by Frederick Hockley, and the early Golden Dawn founders circa 1900. This clearly shows an unbroken line of transmission of this magical technique. Some of this material is coloured by the Christian piousness of those who worked it, and invokes the name of Jesus. This piousness (which is now so unfashionable) was not incompatible with their vocation as magicians, in fact they looked to their faith as an additional protection against the darker spirits who may sometimes manifest even when not called. In these godless times fewer of us have the protection of a strong faith, and so this may seem strange, antiquated, and even unpalatable. These difficulties should however be overlooked, just as you might for example decide to overlook the quirkiness and eccentricity of someone today wearing a chain mail jerkin under his jacket for protection whilst visiting the dodgier parts of a city. In both cases such a precaution may well have been timely. Few if any of these practitioners found any incompatibility between their faith and their dealing with these spiritual creatures, particularly angels. In fact the very first illustration in Sloane MS 3825 makes this point beautifully, as it shows the ideal form of seals for the three persons of the Christian trinity, God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, undoubtedly used for protection. It is probable that these form six double-sided lamens. Reading left to right the first two on the top ['Ow are the front and reverse on a lamen inscribed with Adonai or Lord from the Hebrew Bible. The pair below this also invoke the name Adonai together with Agla, Edonel, Deonel, and Agbel on the everse of a hexagram and hexagon containing the Chi-Rho of Christ strange on a lamen dedicated to the Father) surrounded by a Latin uote commemorating Jehovah. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Of the next pair of lamens dedicated the the Son, the upper one shows a picture of the Son with Tetragrammaton irregularly placed round a pentagram and interlaced with 'Jesus'. The lower lamen shows the 'Lion of the Tribe of Judah' with the old Latin square formula 'Sator Tenet Opera Rotas' on its reverse. If anything in this manuscription does, this shows that the underlying magic is Hebraic or Classical, with a thin veneer of Christianity overlaid. The last pair of lamens represent the Holy Ghost graphically represented by the dove and the star, with a rather less inspired lower lamen echoing the whole Trinity. All too frequently in this era of instant gratification, material is passed over because it is considered too difficult. Although the language of this manuscript transcription might by some be considered too pious and ponderous, it is well worthwhile examining this material in full, for it contains the real magical tradition, as it was practiced from the 16th to the 19th century. Although many invocatory passages may seem long, barely pausing for breath, it is their very length and seeming repetitiveness which is important to the technique. We have not broken down some invocatory sentences that sometimes run on for two pages, divided only by semi-colons and commas, because the point of the invocation is not to analyse their meaning, but to declaim the words to build up the right amount of magical tension to encourage the spiritual creature to manifest, in the Glass Receptacle or Crystal Stone. It is not sufficient to simply read out a paragraph or two. To be effective you should take your time and initially be prepared for hours of work. You should not rush or gabble the passages as some modern practitioners do, or be embarrassed by any verbal errors, but take your time and enjoy speaking these elegant and sonorous invocations. Remember that repetition is to be encouraged. Later after the first manifestation, when you have achieved the knack, and your first visible appearance, results will come much faster. Another interesting aspect of the language in the 17th century, is that there is an increase not just in repetition but also in precision, with the spirit being carefully instructed exactly how to: \"Appear in fair and decent form, & in no wise hurtful Dreadful, Terrible, or Affrightful unto us, or this place, or to any other person or place whatsoever, but in all humility & Serenity, Visibly to the Sight of our Eyes\" No longer is it sufficient to simply conjure the spiritual creature, but now the magician must: 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic \"Exorcise, Conjure, Command, Constrain, & Call forth & move\" This additional precision in the language specifying what is required may well be attributable to the profession of many of the angel magicians of the period, that of lawyer or solicitor. There is another more important reason for this increase in precision, and that is that spirits (and maybe even the angels) have a reputation for tricksy answers, which can be interpreted in a number of ways. By being precise they have less scope for this unsettling tendency. You only have to think of Shakespeare's Macbeth which was written in the years between Dr. John Dee's death in 1604 and 1610 when the play was first performed, contemporary with the composition of these invocations. In the play the predictions of the witches (or are they spirits?) come precisely true to the letter, but not in the way that Macbeth understood them. By misinterpreting their predictions, and taking things into his own hands, Macbeth ruins his own future. In this context it is interesting that one of the first theatre-goers to see Macbeth performed at the Globe, on April 20th 1610, was Dr Simon Forman (1552-1611) who, as we indicated in Volume 1, was another of the line of angel magicians actually using these conj'y.rations. He said of the play2: \"ther was to be observed, frrste, howe Mackbeth and Banck03, two noble men of Scotland, ridinge thorowe a wod, thes stode before them three women feiries or nimphes 4, and saluted Mackbeth, sayinge three tyms unto him, HallIe, Mackbeth, King of Codons; for thou shall be a Kinge, but shall beget no kinds, etc. Then said Bancko, what all to Mackbeth, and nothing to me? Yes, said the nymphes, hallie to thee, Bancko, thou shall beget kinges, yet be no kinge; and so they departed and cam to the coutre of Scotland to Dunkin, King of Scotes and yt was in the days of Edward the Confessor. And Dunkin had them both kindly wellcom, and made Mackbeth forthwith Prince of Northumberland, and sent him hom[eJ to his own castel, and appointed Mackbeth to provide for him, for he would SUp6 with him the next day at night, and did soe. . And Mackbeth contrived to kill Dunkin and throwe the persuasion of his wife did that night murder the kinge in his own castell, beinge his 2 The spelling is Forman's not Shakespeare's. 3 Banquo. 4 It is interesting that Forman (who was viewing the play rather than reading it) saw the witches as fairies or even nymphs, but certainly not as witches or human. This shows how even then, soon after James I ascension to the throne of England, spiritual creatures were still seen as a continuum, not as black and white, good and evil. S Cawdor. 6 Dine. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic guest; and ther were many prodigies7 seen that night and the day before. And when Mackbeth had murdered the kinge, the blod on his handes could not be washed off by any means, nor from his wives hands, which handed the bluddi8 daggers in hiding them, which by means they became both much amazed and affronted. The murder being knowne, Dunkin's two sonns fled, the one to England, the [other to] Walles, to save themselves. They beinge fled, they were supposed guilty of the murder of their father, which was nothing so. Then was Mackbeth crowned kingse; and then he, for feare of Bancko, his old companion, that he should beget kinges but be no kinge himself, he contrived the death of Bancko, and caused him to be murdered on his way as he rode. The next night, beinge at supper with his noble men whom he had to bid to a feaste, to the which also Bancko should have com[e], he began to speak of noble Bancko, and to wish that he werre] ther[e]. And as he did thus, standing up to drink a carouse9 to him, the ghoste of Bancko came and sate down in his cheier behind him. 10 And he, turning about to sit down again, sawe the ghoste of Bancko, which [af]fronted him so, that he fell into a greate passion of fear and fury, utteringe many words about his murder, by which, when they h[e]ard that Bancko was murdered, they suspected Mackbeth. Then Mack Dovell fled to England to the kinges sonn, and soon they raised an army and cam to Scotland, and at Dunstonanyse 12 overthrue Mackbeth. In the meantime, whille Macdove was in England, Mackbeth slew Mackdove's wife and children ... \" The key to the plot is that the prophecies by the 'feiries' were true to the letter. More precisely worded questioning of the 'feiries' by Macbeth might have avoided all that bloodshed, but then of course Shakespeare would not have had such a dramatic play. And so it is that traditionally the wording of invocations and the questions addressed to spiritual creatures should be very precise in their language, so as to leave little room for ambiguity. Another point that is worth considering is that spiritual creatures (be they spirits, angels or demons) usually need a bit of coaxing, and a long drawn out invocation is often more effective than a quick and demanding one. The tone should be one of firm respect, not the hectoring and ordering that is the common interpretation of some grimoires. In Dr Rudd's Nine Celestial Keys, each invocation is 7 Prodigies or strange happenings were often associated with both political upheaval and the action of spiritual creatures. 8 Bloody. 9 Toast. 10 The ghost having been invoked by Macbeth's words. 11 Macduff misheard by Forman as'Macdove'. 12 Dunsinane. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic followed by a 'Replication' which enables the invocant to proceed if the main invocation has not succeeded in producing manifestation. The location of the invocation needs careful planning. Invocation in a quiet natural place far from human habitation, or in a room set aside just for this purpose will usually be more effective and rapid, whilst invocation in a room used for other purposes, in a crowded city will usually take longer and be considerably more arduous. You can draw a parallel between invocation and the difficulties of coaxing a wild animal into a room filled with unfamiliar smells in a city filled with unfamiliar noises, as opposed to doing it in a place not nearly so congested. So select a suitable spot, take your time, pronounce every word clearly, and do not be in a hurry for results. In due course the material in this book will no doubt be boiled down by later writers to a thin gruel, an instant magical fix, which will no doubt sell many more copies. But by publishing this source material here in full, we are satisfied that there will always be the possibility for practitioners to go back to the original working manuscripts of practicing magicians of the period to examine their full instructions and invocations. As a rule of thumb in magic, one should always use the full technique, and avoid omitting any of its constituent parts, until you know exactly how and why each piece works. The Hierarchy of Spiritual Creatures One of the results of the work we have been doing for the last three years has been a clearer picture of the Renaissance perception of the hierarchy of spiritual creatures. Magicians of this period did not make the same distinctions as are commonly used in modern magic, and would be as likely to work with fairies as they would be with angels, demons or Planetary spirits. The whole body of invocatory or evocatory magic was part of a unified corpus of magical practice, and within this practice was a whole range of spiritual creatures. This is demonstrated by the same invocatory style being used to summon archangels, demons, Enochian governors, planetary spirits or Olympic spirits. We came across some fascinating contextual material in manuscript. These documents set the Enochian system clearly within the context of the 9 Orders of Angels, although they also included various other orders of angels13 and spiritual creatures, giving a coherent hierarchy which makes for a clearer picture for working with such grimoires. 13 John Dee had a penchant for sevenfold classifications, hence the name of one of most important productions, De Heptarchia Mystica. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Interestingly, within the grimoires the nine orders of angels have different names to those used in Qabalah, resulting in some confusion, as e.g. The Seraphim in the grimoires correspond to the Chaioth haQadosh of the Qabalah, whereas the Seraphim of the Qabalah correspond to the order of Potestates or Powers in the grimoires. These differences are listed below, with the Qabalistic names for the orders of Angels bracketed behind the grimoire names. In this volume, there is a lot made of the hierarchy, and this is important as any particular spiritual creature should be called in the name of his superior, so it pays the invocant to know who that is. At the top of the Heavens are the 18 fiery regions -the Superior and Celestial Heavens wherein reside the 7 Great Archangels who dwell directly in the presence of the divine. Although this list differs from one authority to another, the usual is Metatron, Raziel, Tzaphkiel, Tzadkiel, Michael, Raphael and Gabriel. Under these are the 9 Orders of Angels: The Superior Hierarchy 1. Seraphim (Chaioth haQadosh) under MetatronjMethratton 2. Cherubim (Auphanim) under Raziel 3. Thrones (Aralim) under TzaphkieljCassiel, who also rules the Olympic Spirit Aratron, the Planetary Spirit Zazel and the Planetary Intelligence Agiel The Middle Hierarchy 4.

Virtues (Malachim) under Michael, who also rules the Olympic Spirit Och, the Planetary Spirit Sorath and the Planetary Intelligence Nakhiel The Inferior Hierarchy 7.

Below the 18 fiery heavens are the 30 Airy or Inferior regions of the Heavens (the Aethyrs), wherein reside the 91 Aerial Princes, who rule over the 4 Angelic Rulers of the Watchtowers, each ruling 6 Seniors, each ruling 16 Angels, each ruling countless spirits Below all these angelic regions are the infernal spirits. These are ruled by the three Kings of the infernal hierarchy - Lucifer, Beelzebub and Sathan. Sathan rules the four Kings of the Air, better known as the four Demon Princes, each of whom has a subordinate demon bishop and numerous lesser demons. The demon princes are: Oriens in the East, under whom is the Demon Bishop Theltryon Amaymon in the South, under whom is the Demon Bishop Boytheon Paymon in the West, under whom is the Demon Bishop Sperion Egyn in the North, under whom is the Demon Bishop Mayerion Under each of the Bishops are many named demons, such as Vas sago , Belial and others, and under them numberless other demons and spirits. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic An interesting observation made in the The Nine Celestial Keys, indicates that as a rule the magician would call spiritual creatures appropriate to the work in hand, rather than always going for the \"big guns\" as it were: \"To conclude Dr. Rudd's Doctrine of the Nine Hierarchies of Angels and the better to understand him, that although the glorious Methratton and Raziel may be invocated for some great signal and weighty matters [such as] to prevent ruin of states and kingdoms and persons in great authority, yet it is the opinion of Dr. Dee and Dr. Rudd, and Iamblichus that ancient magician, that it is rarely practiced since the Olympic powers are sufficient to be invocated and advised with.\" Who Used these Techniques? Dr Thomas Rudd (1583 -1656) Dr Rudd knew Dr John Dee and was interested in the same things from alchemy to angel magic and the geometry of Euclid. It appears that Rudd carried on Dee's experiments in angel magic much further and formed the focus of a group of 17th century angel magicians. In the last Volume we sketched the line of transmission of this knowledge, and to this line we should add Francis Barrett'the hot air balloonist. Francis Barrett (c.1774-c.1802 or 1765-1825) Barrett is mostly remembered for his publication of The Magus, a rather beautifully printed book that was first published in 1801. The Magus consists mainly of selections taken from Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy and the Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy including the Heptameron by Peter De Abano. It has been suggested that Barrett was probably a pupil of Ebenezer Sibly (1751-1800). Barrett lived at the time of the publication of the Magus near Sibly at 99 Norton14 Street, Marylebone, London, and advertised in the book that he took pupils in the magical arts. Although his death date appears not to have been recorded, one of his pupils, Dr Parkins of Lincolnshire refers to him as the 'late Mr F. Barrett' in a manuscript dating from 1802, so it would seem that his penchant for hot air and hydrogen ballooning brought about his early demise soon after the publication of the MaguslS. 14 Now called Bolsover Street. 15 There is some difficulty in establishing Barrett's dates: the first dates above are deduced from manuscript sources, while the second are given by the Rosicrucian Swinburne Clymer. 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic John Denley (1764-1842) According to Frederick Hockley, Denley gave much of the information to Barrett for his book The Magus. Denley was a bookseller specialising in magic and occult books and manuscripts in Catherine Stree, Covent Garden, London 16, and is the link between Francis Barrett and Frederick Hockley. Outside of the great libraries like the British Museum and the Bodleian, Denley's shop contained probably one of the largest collections of occult books and manuscripts in England at that time. It is interesting to note that it was in Denley's bookshop that Lord Bulwer-Lytton claimed to have met the mysterious Brother of the Rosy Cross who gave him the cypher MSS which he used for writing his famous novel Zanoni. Bulwer-Lytton's Rosicrucian novel appears to be quite autobiographical. For instance, when Glyndon asks Zanoni (his Rosicrucian Master) why he decided to teach him the mysteries of Alchemy, Zanoni answered that he knew that one of Glyndon'S ancestors belonged to the Fraternity, and therefore, according to the rules of the brotherhood, it was his duty to instruct him. In fact, this story could well be that of Lord Bulwer-Lytton's family, because one of his ancestors, John Bulwer, was indeed an alchemist in the 16th Century and allegedly belonged to a Rosy Cross Fellowship. Frederick Hockley (1808-1885) One of the angel magicians who worked these methods in the direct line of transmission was Frederick Hockley. Although we touched upon Hockley in the previous volume, it is worth adding a few more interesting points, as Hockley was a much more seminal figure in the history of magic than he is usually given credit. He was lucky to have very early access to significant magical sources as he worked initially for the occult bookseller John Denley. Here he had access to many magical manuscripts. In fact he was paid by Denley to copy some of these manuscripts, which Denley then in turn sold. A handwritten copy of at least one of the manuscripts here transcribed was amongst Hockley's manuscript collection at his death. Hockley spent almost his whole life in the investigation and use of angel magic and crystal skrying. Although he did venture into the then popular practice of spiritualism (or more correctly 'spiritism 1 he always returned to traditional methods for conjuring angels into his crystals. 16 Denley may also have had premises at 10 Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic His first experiment with skrying with crystal and magic mirror was in 1824 at the tender age of 16. Hockley's main interests were communicating with spiritual creatures, be they angels, spirits or even the deceased, in any way possible. He assiduously pursued these interests via skrying and even spiritualism. He was also interested in alchemy, which he certainly undertook seriously in the laboratory, and later in life he became involved with Freemasonry. These interests overlapped in his friendships with a number of the founders of the Golden Dawn, and his membership of the SRIA. Hockley used female skryers in the same tradition as the skryers Dr John Dee used. He filled 30 volumes with transmissions and answers by the spirits to over 12,000 of his questions. Quite a few of these records are still extant. The importance of Hockley in the context of the manuscripts transcribed in this book is that it is certainly known that Hockley copied and utilised both Dr Rudd's calls of the Nine Hierarchies of Angels, and Dr Dee's Calls and Celestial Invocations of the Table of Enoch, linking him and nineteenth century magical procedure directly with two of the most important angel magicians of the 16t h and 17th century respectively. Hockley was also important in the onwards transmission of these magical techniques. Although they were later estranged, one of Hockley's most important pupils was Kenneth R H MacKenzie. MacKenzie regarded Hockley as his master in magical matters, and MacKenzie was in turn very influential with the founders of the Golden Dawn. Hockley's fine collection of manuscripts and printed books, many of which are unobtainable nowadays, were acquired and then resold in 1887 by George Redway, of York Street, Covent Garden in London, just around the corner from where Hockley had acquired his first magical manuscripts at the tender age of 16, an interesting twist of fate. Many of his books, and probably some of his manuscripts, were acquired by founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn like Westcott. Defining Magic The first volume in this series raised considerable controversy in the occult and pagan community, so let us just recap on the main points made there. Please consult that Volume for the detailed arguments behind each of the following rather bald statements: a) Traditional magic was predominantly concerned with the invocation of all types of spiritual creatures such as angels, demons, and spirits. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic b) The origin of these methods is in the grimoires, which show little demarcation between invocation and evocation. The early grimoires treated of angels and demons interchangeably, and either or both might come from the same calling. There is a continuum of spiritual creatures from archangels through angels, elementals, to demons. c) The line of transmission of practical magical methods was through a succession of scholar-magicians, not via the village cunning-man and witch tradition (which uses a different approach), or via secret societies like the Illuminati, Rosicrucianism or Freemasonry (with the single exception of the Golden Dawn). d) Practitioners of ceremonial and angel magic tended to be of one particular social class, with a disproportionate number of jurists and lords, in other words drawn from the Establishment of the day. In tracing this line of scholar-magicians we have discovered that in every age some of the most prominent players were major members of the establishment, politicians, lords, legislators, and even royalty. In short, serious magic was not the pursuit of the dispossessed, the wacky, or the downright crazy. It was, and is, a pursuit worthy of the most intelligent men or women of every age. e) The spiritual creatures invoked are not subjective, nor are they part of the psychological makeup of the invoker. This is a fallacy introduced by Aleister Crowley's comments in 'his' edition of the grimoire the Goetia.17 Demons are not, repeat not, psychological and definitely not anatomical 'portions of the human brain' as Crowley categorically stated in his introduction. In this introduction Crowley writes a tongue in cheek exposition of magic that has confused many generations of students ever since. It was not till the publication of the excellent edition of the Lemegeton by Joseph Peterson in 2001 that Crowley's partial and defective edition has been finally eclipsed. Hopefully his introduction will now also cease to influence current thinking about evocation. Although we have the greatest respect for Crowley's intellectual rigour and pioneering spirit, the introduction penned by Crowley in that book has effectively put back research into evocation by more than 75 years, by introducing the beguiling but deceptive notion that demons are purely subjective. This has reduced evocation from its position as 17 In fact Crowley had very little to do with the transcription of the text of the Goetia. This was done entirely by 5 L MacGregor Mathers. This fact can be easily verified by reading Crowley's introduction, where he speaks of the translation of the Goetia. If he had bothered to look at the relevant manuscripts, he would know that they are in fact in English, not a foreign language. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic a prime magical technique to a second-rate form of psychotherapy. In fact one pair of psychotherapists 18 wrote in 1975: \"Down through the ages the power and wonder of practitioners of magic have been recorded ... These people of power, wrapped in a cloak of secrecy, presented a striking contradiction to the common ways of dealing with the world. The spells and incantations they wove were feared... Whenever these people of power publicly performed their wonders, they would both shatter the concepts of reality of that time and place and present themselves as having something that was beyond learning.\" So far so good, but then this pair of psychotherapists go on to claim that magic is just psychotherapy, specifically just their very own recently devised brand of psychotherapy: \"In modern time, the mantle of the wizard is most often placed upon those dynamic practitioners of psychotherapy who exceed the skill of other therapists by leaps and bounds, and whose work is so amazing to watch that it moves us with powerful emotions, disbelief, and utter confusion. \" Such arrogation of the ancient and honourable term 'magic' to a recent and probably transient psychological practice moves us to disbelief, and undoubtedly many readers to utter confusion. Demons cannot be dealt with via the theories of psychotherapy, a supposed 'science' that is yet to be rigorously proved, which is but a hundred years old, or in the case of the above example just a few decades old. Demons may now be as rare as wolves or bears in the streets of a modern metropolis, but they are real nevertheless. The parallel is deliberate, because it emphasises the fact that both were much more common in the past, and that in the twenty-first century your chances of encountering one is much greater outside of heavily populated urban metropolises. Another thing that is certain is that these creatures are certainly not just 'parts of the human brain' as Crowley would have you believe. f) Christianity, particularly in the person of King James I and his English authorised version of the Bible, blurred the distinction between different kinds of spiritual creatures, and introduced dualism into magic. The Biblical distinction between the Devil and demons became blurred in 1611 when the King James Version of the Bible was published. It chose to translate many very different words (such as satyr, faun, and many other words) simply as 'devil' without regard to their very different meanings. Diabolos, which is the one term 18 Richard Sandler and John Grinder The Structure of Magic I, S&B Books, Palo Alto, 1975. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic that should have been so translated was the supreme spiritual adversary of the god of the Jews and worthy of being called the Devil, but 'demon', and many other words referring to a range of spiritual creatures, who had none of the stature or qualities of Diabolos, did not deserve to be translated by the same English word. These first two points are very well put in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, a recently published work of fiction by Susanna Clarke, which deals with the resurrection of real magical practice in England: \"Magicians are chiefly interested in the usefulness of these supernatural beings; they wish to know under what circumstances and by what means angels, demons and fairies can be brought to lend their aid in magical practices. For their purposes it is almost ,irrelevant that the first class of beings is divinely good, the second infernally wicked and the third morally suspect. Priests on the other hand are scarcely interested in anything else. \"19 Magic and Religion This brings us to the relationship between religion (not just Christianity) and magic. Magic is not religion, nor is religion magic. Whatever anthropologists might say, the roles of magician and priest where very clearly demarked in almost all ancient societies. In the later half of the 20th century, maybe because the role of the priest in society had declined, there has arisen an even greater blurring of the distinction. Religion seeks to pray, implore or submit to a god.20 Magic does not deal with god, but seeks to constrain, bind, and command various lesser spiritual creatures. Although priests have in the past used magic, usually as an adjunct to their duties, it is only very recently that magicians have sought to define their art as a religion. Aleister Crowley again comes to mind as the prime example of someone who attempted to make the fruits of his magic into a religion. In the later half of the 20th century general regard for Christianity, particularly in Protestant countries like the UK, has declined. Regular ,Church of England attendees in the UK for example have dropped from 40% of the population just after World War II to less than 6% at the last census, and currently rather less. We therefore no longer feel it is necessary to rebel, with Crowley, against Christianity. Just as we no longer need to keep pushing the boundaries of the sexual revolution. Much of what he hoped to 19 Page 483. 20 Throughout this book please read 'god or goddess' whenever the term 'god' is used. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic achieve has been achieved via social change rather than religious revolution. In 1904 Crowley received through the mediation or channelling of his wife Rose, a book which he called Liber Al Legis, the Book of the Law. Instead of taking it as a private revelation, Crowley attempted to promote this book as the core of a new religion designed to replace Christianity. It is far from our intention to limit anyone's choice of religion, but we would like to make the observation that the acceptance of the Law of Thelema is not a necessary condition for the learning or practice of magic. In fact in some ways it is a hindrance and a distraction. Had Crowley lived after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, or had not been brought up on the harsh theological diet of the Exclusive Order of the Plymouth Brethren, he may not have felt the same urge to propagate a religion designed to rival Christianity, a belief system which has derogatorily come to be referred to as Crowleyanity. Crowley no doubt was a very important seed force in the overthrow of Victorian sexual and drug restriction, both during his heyday and again in the 1960s, and for that we can all be grateful to him. But we don't need to follow his religion in the working of magic, anymore than we need to take up mountain climbing or latakia smoking in order to achieve the same ends. A second attempt to portray magic as religion has come about in the late 20th century as part of the New Age movement, where 'shamanic' behaviour has merged religion, ecstatic drumming, dancing, drug ingestion, and magic. Most prominent amongst these New Age 'shamans' is Carlos Casteneda.21 His work is an important contribution to the interface between drug-induced states and spiritual creatures, and how one can facilitate communication with the other. Leaving aside how much Casteneda (c.1925-1998) made up as an imaginative anthropologist, and how much he was actually taught by a Yaqui Sorcerer in the Sonoran Desert, his work has in fact blurred the lines between (shamanic) religion and magic, and offers little in the way of systematic concrete technique. Like Leary he tried to put psychedelic drugs into a religious setting. Unlike Leary he also tried to add magic to the mix. The Gods In the previous Volume we introduced the phrase 'spiritual creature' to cover a vast range of entities from archangel and angel through elemental and fairy, to daimon and demon and spirit. In the course of this discussion we also mentioned the gods of other traditions. 21 See Skinner & Drury Search for Abraxas, Spearman, London 1972, pp. 83-6. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic We need to look at these in more detail, specifically the New Age attitude which treats the gods of other communities as potential objects of invocation as well as of devotion. This practice probably stems from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where founders like S L MacGregor Mathers introduced the gods of the ancient Egyptians and of Samothrace and Babylon into the otherwise predominately Masonic rituals of the Order 22. Before this the practice of magic and the Classical interest in foreign gods were quite distinct pursuits. Obviously the planets were a long time part of magic, but where for example, Venus was part of a ritual, it was the Venusian qualities of the planet rather than the Roman goddess herself which were being invoked. You have to remember that at the turn of the century, when the Golden Dawn was flourishing, all well educated people had a reasonable grasp of the Classics which formed part of European civilisation, and could have rattled off the attributes of most of the Greek and Roman gods without too much difficulty. Many, like Aleister Crowley, MacGregor Mathers, and Wynn Westcott would have had a reasonable grasp of Latin, and a smattering of Classical Greek. As such the Greek and Roman gods were part of their cultural experience. In the Victorian period these gods were part and parcel of the ·culture of every European country, for the Romans had, until the first Christian Emperor Constantine I (324-337 AD) spread their culture and that of their predecessors the Greeks across the whole continent, leaving behind significant quantities of architecture and literature. Nowadays, unfortunately, the Classics are no longer taught at school, having been largely replaced by science, technology, social and business studies, so that people are no longer brought up with these gods as part of their everyday knowledge. These gods have become in many ways alien to anyone with a modern education. For Americans, the gap is even wider, as they have not grown up in an atmosphere or a city where images of the old gods still form part of the architecture, decoration and statutory of their surroundings. One could not, for example, grow up in modern Rome without some appreciation of the classical gods, even if one were a devout atheist. One of the most exciting features of the late nineteenth century was the discovery and excavation of much of the world of ancient Egypt, Chaldea and Babylonia. A quick glance at the many books written by Sir Wallis Budge, who was certainly involved in one way or another with the Golden Dawn, will show how these ancient 22 There is of course a precedent for this in the French inspired Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic civilisations and their gods erupted into the popular consciousness during the period from the time of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt to the First World War (1800-1914). It is not surprising then that Mathers, with the help of Wallis Budge and Florence Farr, chose to insert these 'new', emotive, and powerful godforms into the rituals of the Golden Dawn. These ancient Egyptian gods were inserted into the practice of magic in much the same way as the modern interest in mathematical chaos theory has led to the generation by Pete Carroll of a school of chaos magic. Both additions are cultural products of their own period, and not part of the underlying traditions of magic. Of course, if it works then by all means use it. But does it work because of these additions, or in spite of them? The gods of Greece and Rome are no longer part of Western education and therefore no longer part of its culture, and the gods of Egypt and Babylonia never really were. Can we consider these gods of other cultures in the same class as the many spiritual creatures of our own culture. Can we just 'use' these gods in the same way as we might use an elemental? The Christian church's original view of ancient gods of other cultures was that they were little more than demons. This is a view derived from the Old Testament where competitor gods were downgraded in the popular imagination by the reigning religion, as a way of dealing with them. Today however we don't have the same politico-religious objectives, so can we look at these gods objectively? Should we behave like the church and demote them to the status of demon, or should they be accorded the same respect as they were when they had large congregations of their own. This is where the essential difference between religion and magic comes in. Gods belonging to other cultures should still be treated as gods. Initiation Passive and Active Initiation used to be a practical proof of ability, not a passive conferment of a grade. Magical is above all a practical art. In Chinese Taoist magic, and in Western magic before the 19th century, progression came from doing, from the novice successfully using an invocation or binding a specific spirit. It is instructive to look at the classic Taoist approach to magic which still prevails today:23 23 Kristofer Schipper and Wang Hsiu-huei Progressive and Regressive Time Cycles in Taoist Ritua~ 1986, p. 194. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic \"The Taoist system of grading (ke) was based on the concept of merit (gong or gongfu)... This acquisition of merit resulted in turn in an increase in power ... and an upgrading in status. The consecrated way of obtaining merit was through the accomplishment of ritual. Indeed the larger the cycle [of ritual], the greater the merit and its upgrading power.\" Why are we looking at Eastern magic here? The key is the ongoing and still live tradition of Taoist magic, which has unbroken lineages stretching back many generations. Such a practitioner has to do the ritual and prove he has command of the technique and of the associated spiritual creatures. He must demonstrate his power and ability to handle them before being upgraded to a higher grade. The same principle applies in gongfu (or perhaps more recognisably, 'kung fu 1, where it is necessary to defeat or at least match an opponent of a certain grade before being upgraded. The same term 'gongfu'is incidentally used in both magic and martial arts circles. In Taoist magic and the martial arts, grading is not a passive benediction or passing on of a 'blessing' as it is in the more passive meditative arts, nor was it in the past in Western magic. In 19th century Europe however the idea of magic initiation was watered down from it being a real trial and test of skill (in which the candidate had to work hard at mastering a technique) to the simple conferring of initiation by the higher ranking members of the Order. This benediction occurred as the climax to an appropriately enacted symbolic drama, built along Freemasonic lines, during which the candidate is led round blindfolded and prompted with a series of pre-scripted answers. In many cases this is effective psychologically but not necessarily magically. On the other hand, if such Orders reverted to the old system of the candidate having to prove him/herself through practical work, or a successfully complete quest, then many more postulants would end up with real magical ability rather than just the ability to pass theory exams and smoothly playact a symbolic drama. Many graduates of such a system do indeed privately feel a bit let down at the end of their initiations. Even where some psychological elevation occurs, the particularly British practice of going for a meal or 'down the pub' with the other celebrants immediately afterwards effectively discharges much of the momentum and energy built up. This is again an import from Freemasonry, where the convivial meal afterwards was part of the fraternal process. A more useful procedure after a successful invocation is the private and detailed recording of results, particularly of the spirit seal or signature, which will enable the spirit to be called with much less effort next time. 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Keys to t:p.e Gateway of Magic With the introduction of the Freemasonic initiation format, the symbolic and mystical approach has prevailed over the magical and practical approach. We are not objecting to the passing on of moksha or baraka or illumination if the meditative path is the chosen one. But such transmission is not the way of magic, Eastern or Western, where the candidate has instead to prove his ability to command and control a certain 'register' or 'directory' of spirits. The 'register' of spirits is a common concept in Taoist magic where the power of the postulant is judged by the number and type of registers of spirits to which he has access and of which he has command. The Western equivalent of a register is a list like the 72 demons of the Goetia, although that particular grimoire does not give, in the currently printed editions, the words and identities that govern and command each of these spiritS.24 24 The next Volume in this series will provide that information. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic The Manuscripts Content & Provenance The full details of the manuscript items here transcribed with their folio numbers are as follows.

So we can see that the line of transmission is very similar to the manuscripts transcribed in Volume 1, and they were used by both Jekyll (1663-1738) and Sloane (1660-1753) as well as probably being accessed by his fellow angel magician Baron Somers of Evesham (1651-1716). Our main transcription source is Sloane MS 3825, the earliest of our sources, and probably, from the handwriting, dating from the early to mid 17th century.

Sloane MS 3824 is only of minor interest from the point of view of this Volume, as we have only used another copy of the Tenth Key. The Demon Prince invocations are included in Sloane MS 3821. Strangely, in this volume another unrelated item has been bound into the middle of these invocations. The Demon Prince invocations also occur without such a break in Rawlinson MS D .1363. We originally intended to simply publish a transcription of the whole of Harley MS 6482, but decided that it would be much more useful to group similar items together, rather than simply grouping them according to the sometimes haphazard binder's collation order. We have published items drawn from the same magical technique together, rather than simply grouping them according to the way they had been bound by Sir Hans Sloane's manuscript bookbinders. We have therefore chosen to just transcribe those items which relate to specific types of angel magic. Other items in these manuscripts outlining other techniques, such as those relating to the Olympic Spirits or the Shemhamphorash formulae will be included in their proper place in future Volumes in this series. Adam McLean in his introduction to the excellent A Treatise on Angel Magic summed up the nature of this manuscript \"It is also my view that this Treatise was intended as a compilation of the traditions of Angel Magic of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, for the use of a group of practicing occultists centred around Dr. Rudd. Hopefully further historical research might help to identify this group and their means of working.» 25 Harley MS 6482 is also transcribed in Adam McLean's A Treatise on Angel Magic, where the relevant printed pages are 24-28 and 173-211. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic We concur with Adam's conclusions, and part of the purpose of this series is to provide the original working documents and show the methods used to summon both angels and demons. This research is ongoing, but the initial line of transmission or lineage of these techniques from one scholar magician to another from before Dr John Dee to the founders of the Golden Dawn is already firmly established. By the end of the series, key manuscripts will have been transcribed and printed in their entirety, but the material will have been grouped in Volumes according to the techniques used, as the original 16th and 17th century magicians would have understood them. Apart from the incredible similarity in style between the invocations of the Archangels and Orders of Angels displayed in the material presented here in Sloane MS 3628, Sloane MS 3825 and Harley MS 6482, and that of Sloane MSS 307 & 3821,26 published in the first Volume of the series, there are other links that demonstrates the continuity and coherence of this material as a single body of work on angel magic: for example the latter part of Sloane MS 3825, which is lost midway through the Invocation of Agiel, is identical to the material in ff.205-225 of Sloane MS 3821 :27 The Tenth Key, the single piece that is written in a different hand, a later addition, is also to be found amongst miscellaneous pieces in Sloane MS 3824. This manuscript also contains material on Treasure Spirits following exactly the same style of invocatory formula as all of this material. The copy of this piece in Sloane MS 3825 also looks very rushed, the handwriting suggesting the copyist was in a great hurry, and this is also borne out by the absence of red ink and punctuation in the text. Curiously the version of the Tenth Key that is found in Sloane MS 3824 (ff.81-83b) is of greater length and more akin to the Nine Celestial Keys in Sloane MS 3825. However here also the handwriting looks hurried and there is an absence of punctuation, though red ink is used to mark out key words in the text. Therefore we deduce that the original Rudd work contained only Nine Keys, but some later scribe, unfamiliar with the long running tradition of the Nine Hierarchies has decided that the 10th Sephirah, Malkuth, also needed a Key of its own. For completeness we have included this. 26 See Volume 1 in the preSent series, The Practical Angel Magic of John Dee's Enochian Tables by Stephen Skinner & David Rankine.

For this reason the material from both manuscripts is presented in full where there are different illustrations or major textual differences that cannot easily be explained in footnotes. The Prayer and the Nine Celestial Keys are also reproduced in the front of Sloane MS 3628, without the 'Replications' given in the other sources, suggesting a later provenance for that manuscript. The main content of that manuscript is the fourth of five magical diaries of one of the main angel magicians of the 17th century, covering the period Apri11686 -December 1688. In the context of this current Volume, Rawlinson MS D.1363 is of minor importance. It is clearly written, probably in the late 17th century, and is obviously a magician's fair copy. In it (ff. 20-22v) the copyist has copied a part. of the Magick of Arbatel,28 the Demon Princes (ff. 26-35) here printed as Part 3 of this Volume, and a prayer to Enoch (ff.38-40) already printed in Volume 1 of the present series. In each case these extracts are obviously copied from earlier sources. The value of Rawlinson MS D.1363 lies in its clear hand, which provides for a check on some words, rather than as a source text.29 Although this may all sound a bit complex, the main manuscript used in the compilation of this book was British Library Sloane MS 3825, catalogued as Janua Magica Reserata, literally the 'The Keys to the Gateway of Magic' and we hope that, for our readers, this book will prove to be so. 28 Published in full in Agrippa, H.

It is interesting to speculate, and it is just speculation, that these may have been the names of skryers employed by the owner of the manuscript, or of others in his group. Other names associated with this manuscript include Jene Sandifoord, John Simmonds and Mary Lee. These names may provide future clues to the fascinating history of these manuscripts. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Notes on Style used in the Transcription Abbreviations Some abbreviations have been expanded for convenience of reading. Where the abbreviation \"E. W. N. & S.\" appears in the text for example, it has been expanded to \"East, West, North & South\". The abbreviation \"C.S. or G.R.\" has been expanded to \"Crystal Stone or Glass Receptacle\". This expression is a common expression in many of the manuscripts of angel magic and can be seen fully expanded in for example the Art Theurgia Goetia30 where is says \"you may call these spirits into a Crystal stone or Glass Receptacle, [this] being an Ancient & usual way of Receiving & binding of spirits, This Crystal Stone must be four Inches Diameter set on a Table of Art\". Likewise \"C.G.\" has been expanded to \"Crystal Glass\". This usage also clearly shows the influence of the techniques of Goetic magic on angelic magic. The term \"Essce\" has been expanded to its full form of \"Essence\". However \"&\", which is used frequently through the manuscript has been maintained, as has \"&c\" for \"etcetera\". Style Capitalisation and punctuation vary considerably from manuscript to manuscript, even from the same period. Capitalisation in some manuscripts is applied to all significant nouns, in others such as Harley MS 6482 the usage is closer to modern usage. We have used the earlier manuscript in each case resulting in more initial capitalisations than the modern reader is accustomed to. Paragraph structure was kept to the original form in Volume 1, resulting in some very long paragraphs. In this volume we decided to silently insert some paragraph breaks in the interests of easier reading, where this does not affect the meaning or the flow. In general the spelling of the manuscript has been rationalised to modern English, without interfering with the meaning. For example words like \"soe\" and \"doe\" have been transcribed as \"so\" and \"do\", \"crelestial\" as \"celestial\", and \"Angell\" as \"Angel\". 30 See The Lesser Key of S%m on, Joseph H. Peterson (editor), p65 -\"you may call these spirits into a Crystal Stone or Glass Receptacle, [this] being an Ancient & usual way or Receiving & binding of spirits, This Crystal Stone must be four Inches Diameter set on a Table of Art\". 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic The grammar of the manuscript is reproduced faithfully, and no attempt has been made to render it into a modern English form, the text being sufficiently clear in its original form as not to warrant such alteration.

An Idea is a form above Bodies, souls or minds, & it is but one simple, pure, Immutable, Indivisible, Incorporeal and Eternal: Now the nature of all Ideas is the same. Ideas is first placed in God himself, by way of Cause, & they are distinguished amongst them selves, by some relative considerations only, lest whatsoever is in the world should be but one thing without any variety, & that they agree in Essence, lest God should be a compound substance. Secondly Ideas is placed in the very intelligible it self (that is) in the Soul of the world, differing the one from the other by absolute forms: But not that all the Ideas in God are but one form, but in the Soul of the world, they are many. They are Likewise placed in the minds of all other things, whether they be joined to the body, or separated from the body; by a certain participation, & by degrees are distinguished more & more.

Therefore those things in which, there is loss of the Ideas of the matter (vis) such things which have a greater resemblance of things separated, have more powerful virtues in operation, being like to the operation of a separated Idea. By all which we may plainly see, that the Situation of Celestial, is the Cause of all those excellent virtues that are inferior species. As God is the Beginning, & Ending of all virtues, and the marvellous Disposer of all things; So we must know that he gives the soul of the Ideas to his servants, the Blessed Intelligences, who as faithful officers signal things entrusted to them, with an Ideal Virtue; the Heavens & stars as Instruments, disposing the matter in the man while for receiving those fonns which reside in Divine Majesty, & to be conveyed by stars, and the Giver of fonns distributes those by the ministry of his Intelligences, which he has set as Rulers & Controllers over his works, to whom such power is entrusted in things committed to them, that so the virtues & operations of all things, as herbs, metals, stones &c: may come from the governing Intelligences immediately, from the first Idea, & next from the Configurations of the Heavens, disposing, & lastly from the compass of the Elements dispersed, answering to the celestial Influences, by which the Elements themselves are disposed & ordered. 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Now these Kinds of operations are performed in those inferior things, by express forms, in the Heavens by disposing virtues, in the Intelligences by mediating Rules, and in the Original cause by ideas & Exemplary forms.

The Difference of the Degrees of spirits is rehearsed by Gaudentius Merula181 taking the same out of Psellius182 who maketh Six kinds or degrees of spirits between heaven and hell. The first are those that remained in the highest Region of the Air, he calleth Angels of fire because they are near unto that region and perchance within it. The second kind, saith he, is from the middle region of the air downwards towards the earth. The third on the Earth itself. The fourth in the waters. The fifth in the Caves and hollow vaults of the earth. The sixth in the very dungeon and abysme of hell. In such sort, that they are as it were interlinked one with another, but all these spirits have duties and offices of divers sorts. For the chiefest grief and pain of the first which were those that had least offended, seeing themselves so near Heaven, is the Contemplation: that through their wickedness they have left so great a beatitude (though this be general to them all), and those are nothing so harmful as the others are. 179 From this section 'Of Angels Good and Bad Their Degrees and Officers' onwards this text is to be found in Harley MS 6482 ft. 40-61v.

An example to this purpose I find in Malleus Malleficarum 183: the Commissioners having apprehended certain sorcerers, willed one of them to show that she could do, assuring her life on condition that from hence forward, she should no more offend in the like. Whereupon, going out of. the fields in presence of the Commissioners and others, she made a pit in the ground with her hands making her water into the same, which being done she stirred around the urine with one of her fingers, out of the which by little and little after she had made certain characters and mumbled a few words, there arose a vapour which ascending upwards like a smoke, began to thicken of itself in the midst of the Region of the air, gathering and making there a black fearful cloud, which cast out so many thunders and lightnings that it seemed to be a thing hellish and Infernal. The woman remaining all this while still, asked the Commissioners where they would have that cloud to discharge a great quantity of stones, they pointing her to a certain place where it could do no hurt at all, the cloud of a sudden began to move itself with a great furious blustering of winds and in short space coming over the place appointed, discharged a great number of stones like a violent shower directly within the compass thereof. And in this sort may the witches and Necromancers184 make many such like things through the help of these spirits.

A strange chance happened to a boy in the city of Astorges.185A man of good quality and learning there had two sons, the one being about twelve or thirteen years old had by some fault so offended his mother that in a rage she cursed him with detestable Maledictions betaking him to the Devils of Hell, and wishing that they would fetch him out of her presence. This was about ten at night, being very dark; the foolish woman continued her curses so long, till at last the boy, through fear went out into a little court behind the house, out of which he suddenly vanished, and though they diligently searched round the house they could by no means find him, at which they exceedingly wondered, for both the doors of the house were locked, and round the house they searched but could find no way for his going out. About two hours after, they heard in a chamber above their heads a very great noise, and withall the young boy groaning with extreme anguish and grief. They presently going up and opening the chamber door which they found also fast locked, they perceived the silly boy grovelling on the ground in a most pitiful manner, for besides his garments rent to pieces, his face and hands and in a manner his whole body scratched and grated as if he had been drawn through briars and thorns, and he was so disfigured and dismayed, that he came not all that night to himself. In the meantime, his parents caused him to be dressed and cured, omitting nothing to the recovery of his health. The next day, after his senses were somewhat comforted, and he began to recover his judgement, they asked him by what means this accident had happened to him. To whom he made answer, that as he stood in the court there came unto him certain men of exceeding great stature, grim in countenance and in gesture loathsome and horrible, who presently without speaking any word hoisted him up into the air and carried him away with such swiftness, that it was not possible to his seeming for any bird in the world to fly so fast; and at last lighting down amongst certain mountains full of bushes 185 Interestingly the Greek word 'Astorges' means 'without natural familial love'. 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic and briars, they trailed him through the thickest parts of them from one side to another, with intention to kill, he had at last the grace and memory to commend himself unto God beseeching Him to help and assist him at which very instant they turned back with him through the air, and put him in a little window which was there in the chamber, where when they had left him they vanished away. The boy lived many years after but remained ever after deaf and dull conceited, never recovering his former quickness and vivacity of spirit, taking continually exceeding grief when any man talked to him of this matter. The fourth kind of Spirits are those which are in the water as well the Seas as floods, rivers and lakes. These never cease to raise damps and storms persecuting those which sail, putting them in great dangers through violent and raging tempests, procuring to destroy and drown the ships also through the aid of monstrous rocks and shallows which are in the sea. Overturning the boats that are in the rivers, and causing those that swim to entangle themselves in sedges or woods, or bringing them into some pits or holes where they cannot get out, and by all means possible persecute and molest them so far as the limitation of their power extendeth. The fifth kind of Spirits are those which are in the caves and vaults of the Earth, where they lie in wait to entrap those that dig in mines and wells and other works underground, whose death and destruction they covet and procure as much as they may. These cause the motions and tremblings of the earth through the aid of the Winds which are there enclosed, whereby whole cities are often in danger to be swallowed up, especially those which are built near the Sea. Whole mountains are hereby thrown down, infinite people destroyed; sometimes the sea hereby breaketh into the land wasting and destroying whatever it findeth before it.

This man uttered many of the Devil's secrets, of which this of ye Incubi and Succubi was one, and many others that for their fllthiness and abomination are not to be spoken of; but according to his confession, all the Devils do not use this execrable offence, but those only who are near unto us, and do form their bodies of a gross substance, as of water or earth.

The Art of Necromancy was used in old time by faithful and unfaithful and in our days by divers. This Art may be exercised in two sorts. The first is Natural, which may be wrought through things, whose virtue and property is natural to do them, as herbs, plants and stones, and other things as the planets and heavenly influences, and this Art is lawful and may be used and practiced of those that can attain to this knowledge of their hidden properties. Aquinas, in his book, \"De Ente et Essentia\", alleged that Abel the son of Adam made a book of all the virtues and properties of the planets foreknowing that the world should perish through the general flood, he enclosed so cunningly in a stone that the waters could not come to corrupt the same, whereby it might be preserved and known to all people. This stone was found by Hermes Trismegistus, who breaking it, and finding the book therein enclosed, profited wonderfully by applying the contents thereof to his use; which Book, coming afterwards into the hand of St. Thomas, he did therewith many great experiences, one was, that being sick and troubled with the noise of beasts and carriages that passed through the street, remedied that trouble by making an Image as the book proscribed him, which being buried in the street none of all the beasts had the power to pass thereby, but coming thither stayed or went backwards, nor could any man be constrained to do the contrary. He also telleth of a certain friend of his, who by the same book, made an Image, and putting it into a fountain, it caused all such vessels as touched the water thereof to break presently, which came by observation of certain hours and points in working of those Images, of which they took great account and heed, to the end that the planets might the better use their influence in working those things which seemed supernatural. The use of all this is so lawful that nothing can be said to the contrary. The other kind of Necromancy or Art of Magic, is that which is used and practised through the help and favour of the Devil, which hath been long time exercised in the world. Of this the Holy Scriptures testify, speaking of the Magicians of Pharaoh, who contended with Moses and Aaron, as in the New Testament in the Acts making mention of Simon Magus rebuked by St. Peter, and besides you must understand that the Devils may be forced and constrained by 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic the good Angels, and this is because of the Grace which the one lost, and\" the other as yet retains. None can use or exercise this Art of Necromancy unless he fIrst make a secret Agreement or express Covenant with the Devil, and such Devils with whom they deal in those Covenants are not of the common sort but of a higher and superior condition, for amongst themselves they do observe their orders and degrees of superiority, as Franciscus de Victoria asserts, and this is for the better use of their wickedness, and so saith Aquinas. Some Devils are preferred as principals to command the rest, and the inferior Devils are subject unto those, which are of mighty force to execute their wickedness. And therefore the Jews said unto Christ, that he wrought his Miracles in the name of Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils, so that the Necromancer and Magicians that are confederated with the Princes and Captains of the Infernal army, have always the lesser and inferior Devils in a readiness at Commandment to do their will and pleasure, being thereunto constrained by those of the higher dignity and condition. It is the opinion of St. Augustine and Aquinas that the Devils are not kept bound and enclosed in rings, boxes or Vials. The Devils may make them believe so with whom they deal, for they are where and in what place, and when they list themselves, and how far soever they be off, yet at such time as they are called, or their presence required, they come in at that instant to make answer to those which holding them for familiars, and thinking surely that they carry them always present with them, demand or ask anything of them, who are greatly abused and deceived in presuming that they are able to hold them forcibly at their Commandment, because it proceedeth not through the words of the Necromancer, but through the might and authority of the higher Spirits and Devils which as Captains govern and Command them.

And the Prince of these Demons is Beelzebub, that is an old God, he said I shall ascend above the height of the clouds and be like the Most High. 2 Spiritus Mendaciorum Mter these follow the spirits of Lying, of which kind was he that was a lying spirit in the mouths of Ahab's prophets. And their Prince is that spirit Python, from whom Apollo Pythius was called, and that pythonic woman with Samuel, and that other woman in the Gospels that had a python in her belly. This kind of Demon deceives by their Oracles, divinations and predictions. 3 Vasa Iniquitatis In the third Order are the Vessels of Iniquity, which are called the Vessels of Anger. These are the inventors of mischief and of all wicked Arts. Plato mentions one of these wicked Demons that was called Theutus who taught plays, dice and cards; from these proceed all wickedness, malice and deformity. In Genesis, Jacob called Symeon and Levi \"Vessels of Iniquity\", in their dwellings with the Psalmist ''Vessels of Death\", Isaiah called them \"Vessels of Fury\", and Jeremiah \"Vessels of Anger\", and Ezekiel \"Vessels of Killing and destruction\".

And their Prince is called Merizim. This is a South Demon, a raging and furious Demon in the South whom Paul calls in the Ephesians, a Prince of the power of the air and a spirit which works in the Children of Disobedience. 7 Furiae The seventh Mansion the Furies hold -the Sowers of Mischief and discord, wars, and destruction, whose Prince in the Apocalypse is called in Greek Apollyon, in Hebrew Abaddon, that is, destroying and laying waste. 8 Criminatores In the eighth place stand the Criminators or Accusers, whose Prince is Astaroth, that is, an Explorator in Greek. He is called Diabolos, that is a Criminator or Calumniator, who in the Apocalypse is called an Accuser of the Brethren day and night before the face of God. 9 Tentatores Maligenii The last place hold the Tempters, who we call the bad Genii and their Prince is Mammon, who is interpreted Covetousness. But these bad Demons do unanimously infect this lower world, and therefore are called Diaboli.

Other divines say that no Demons were created wicked but were cast down from the Heavens from the Orders of good Angels, for their prevarication, as all Hebrew divines, Assyrian, Arabian and Egyptian do confmn. Phererides the Syrian describes the fall of Demons, and Ophin, that is a Serpent Demoniac, that was the head of the rebellious army.

Many of the lapsed Angels may hope to be saved, and bring this argument out of the Gospel, that Christ heard the prayers of Demons and suffered them to go into the herd of swine. Psalm 72[:9], \"the Ethiopians shall fall down before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust\" 187, but according to the Hebrews, verily it runs thus. \"Before him the inhabitants of solitude shall bend their knees, that is, the aerial spirits shall worship him as the Cabalists do assert, and his enemies shall lick the dust\"188, which they expound of Zazel and his army, of whom it is read in Genesis189 -\"Thou shalt eat dust all their days of thy life.\" Hence the Cabalists think that some demons may be saved, and it was the opinion of Origen. 186 Origen of Alexandria (185 -254 AD). 187 Quote marks added. 188 Quote marks added. 189 Said of the Serpent in Genesis3:14. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Keys to the Gateway of Magic Of the Bodies of Demons There are great differences among Divines and Philosophers. Aquinas affirms that all the Angels as well as wicked demons are incorporeal, but sometimes they assume bodies which they presently put off. Dionysius in his Divine Names affirms that the Angels are without bodies. [St. J Augustine upon Genesis sayeth that Demons are said to be airy as well as fiery animals, neither are they loosed by death because there prevails in them the Element to act rather than to suffer, and further sayeth that all Angels from the beginning of their Creation had aerial bodies formed from the pure and more superior part of the air fit for action not passion, and these bodies were preserved after confirmation by the good Angels, but by the bad Angels were changed into the quality of grosser air that they might suffer by fire. The great Basil doth not only attribute bodies to Demons but also to pure Angels, as certain small aerial and pure spirits, And Gregory Nazianzene190 agrees to this, also Apuleius that all demons have bodies as you may read of Socrates' Daemon. Psellus the Platonic and Christian held that demons by nature could not be without a body, as bodies of shadow and subject to passion, as if smitten should be more sorrowful, and if burnt should turn to ashes, which was proved true in Tuscia. According to the mixture of the Elements among themselves, so are the different kinds of the bodies of demons, which will require a large discourse if all objections to the contrary are answered. Divines are of the opinion that all wicked demons are of that nature that they equally hate God as well as man, but divine providence hath ordered good demons more pure and near to us to watch over us and daily help us, and that they may drive away and bind those bad demons that they may not hurt us as they would do. You may read in Tobit of Raphael that bound Asmodeus a Demon in the desert of the Upper Egypt191. 190 st Gregory Nazianzene (circa 325-390 AD). 191 Angels often know what it is that will bind the demon over which they have been given dominion. The angel Raphael, for example, instructed Tobiah to place fish liver and heart on the embers of burning incense.

remember. He wrote, with Francis King, the classic Techniques of High Magic in 1976. He followed that with Oracle of Geomancy and Terrestrial Astrology which has become the standard work on Western divinatory geomancy. Books on Nostradamus and Millennium Prophecies followed in highly illustrated editions. He also edited editions of Aleister Crowley's Magical Diaries and Astrology. In the 1970s Stephen was responsible for stimulat-ing interest in John Dee and Enochian magic by publishing the first reprint of Casaubon's True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers between Dr John Dee and some Spirits ... and Dr Donald Laycock's key reference book on the angelic language The Complete Enochian Dictionary. Stephen is also the author of eight books on feng shui, including the first one written in English in the 20th century and now lives near Singapore, where he pursues researches and experimentation in classical magical techniques. David Rankine has been practising magic for the last 25 years and writing about it for the last 17 years. During that time he has been involved with Golden Dawn, Qabalistic and Thelemic groups, and gives regular talks and workshops around Europe. He has also written Becoming Magick, Magick Without Peers, and Crystal Healing and Folklore, as well as being a major contributor to the Enhancing Your Mind, Body, Spirit partwork series.
