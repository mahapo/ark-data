[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Enchiridion of Pope Leo III Translated from original French Sources by Sarah Kane French 2004 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"  "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 1 With the Wise Cabalists It is only after assiduous research that we have been able to improve and supplement The Enchiridion of Pope Leo III. All the editions of this work, which were able to be gathered from Parma, Mainz, Rome, Lyon, and Frankfurt, and others, enabled us to place things in an order and exactitude not seen until now. The editions all vary, to some degree, and it is because of these various changes, or because one finds an analogy with the author, that it has been called Papillons, (in French, The Butterflies.) A separate note from your illustrious editor: I have never heard of the Enchiridion called Papillons before. The closest I have heard is one of the many versions of The Black Pullet, or The Treasure of the Old Man of the Pyramids, which has been called The Green Butterfly, as well as Red Magic, The Hen with the Golden Eggs, and the Queen of Hairy Flies. However, according to the edition I had access to, the Enchiridion also maintained a Butterfly reference. One finds in the various editions the seven psalms appropriate to this work, which we have removed, adding in the place of those psalms, the names and characters of the same spirits to which they are referent, pulled from the Cabala. (In my editing, I have put those psalms back, while retaining these authors’ work.) Charlemagne, to whom this work is devoted, like a precious treasure, was the first who knew, by experience, the surprising and marvelous effects, if the Orisons herein are spoken with veneration, with the face towards the rising sun. He carried with him all the figures in this book, in gold, upon his person. Earlier versions of this work refer to Charlemagne carrying ones made from the flowering ash tree. Either way, who can say. The person who benefits carries them upon himself at the appropriate times. To know these, consult the Magical Calender in the Occult Philosophy of Agrippa. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 2 The Beginning, according to the Gospel of John In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was as God, and the Word was God, and it began with God. All things have been made by Him, nothing has been made without Him. There is life in Him, and His life, (the Grace of God), was the Light of man. This light shone in the darkness, and the darkness could not surround it. There was a man, named John, sent by God, who was to witness and give testimony of the light, so all would believe. And still, while he gave testimony of the light, and was, himself, the light, the true light, which lights any man in the world, and it was in the world, and the world was made by Him, the world did not know. It came on it’s own heritage, and the people did not receive it. (Your humble editor translates further. God sent John, to give testimony and teach. Although God had created the world, and all in it, all people and creatures in the world had free will, and many refused to believe.) It gives capacity to be made children of God, all who believe in it, and believe on it’s behalf, which are of His blood, will not be tempted by desires of the flesh, nor the will of man, but be of God, (being regenerated by the Sacrament, and the Grace of Jesus Christ.) And the Word was made flesh, and has lived among us. And we saw His Glory, as the only Son of the Father. He was filled with Grace and Truth. Let us return, with Grace, to God. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 3 Psalm 6 O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me, for thy mercies’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? I am weary with my groaning: all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly. Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me....etc. David wrote this Psalm to ask God for victory over his son, Absalom, and forgiveness for his sins. In it’s devotion, it comforts the sinner, and removes sadness for having offended God, and it converts it into joy and love. Saint Cassiadore says that those who say this Psalm three times will change the unwillingness of an iniquitous Judge, and hinders being condemned wrongfully. It is good against all work and torments of the spirit, saying it seven times when one needs, naming, each time, the name of it’s Intelligence, then “I request Isu, Lord of Safety, by virtue of you Holy names, and this Psalm, that you deliver me from N’s torments, or from what delivery from evil may please you.” It is good against evils of the eyes, if said seven times during three days of continuation, and to name the Intelligence, and all the time, write the character on a leaf of lettuce, with which you touch the eye. The name of the Intelligence is Hael, and his character is: "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 4 Psalm 31 In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for a house of defense to save me. For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me Pull me out of the net the have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength. Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the Lord. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities. And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. I was a reproach among mine enemies, but especially among my neighbors, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel. For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from they that persecute me. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake. Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Blessed be the Lord; for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong city. For I have said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud door. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord. Beati quorum remissae sunt.....etc. It is used to know that God has forgiven our sins, and counters the bites of dogs and snakes, and particularly the verse, in chamo et freno, etc..... It is still good for those which have hidden crimes, and fear to be discovered. If they say it three times, everyday, with the name of the Intelligence, which is necessary to write on one’s chest, with it’s character. For clarification, say the Psalm three times. Write the name of the Intelligence. Never speak it. The Intelligence’s name is Hunel. The character is: "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 5 Psalm 37 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evidence shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous. The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth. For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he shall fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. I have been young, but now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell forevermore. For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved forever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein forever. The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. The Lord shall not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble. And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 6 Domine, ne in furore tuo argos me.....etc. Saint Jerome and Saint Augustine ensure that devotion with this Psalm obtains remission of one’s sins, and makes one exempt from pain and sorrow through it’s merit. It renders evil null and void, if one writes it on a silver blade with a punch, when Mars is in good aspect with the Moon. The name and character of the Intelligence must be written along with the character and Intelligence of Tuesday, and it must be said to the patient in the morning and evening, for seven days straight. He should carry the aforementioned blade near his neck all during that time. The Intelligence’s name is Ramiach, and the character is:  "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 7 Psalm 50 The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifice or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds: For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fullness whereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High: And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. But unto the wicked God saith, what hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth. Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against they brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God. Misere mei, Deus, secundum magnam.....etc. David, having taken Bethsabee (Bathsheba?), after the death of her husband, Urie (Uriah?), and the prophet, Nathan, having taken it again, as sun, in the Second Book of Kings, Chapter 12, knowing his sin, then made this Psalm, which has the virtue to give contrition, by the command of God. (A note from your gentle editor: I read 2 Kings Chapter 12, and there was nothing of this.) Saint Jerome says it will give remission of our sins, if one says it everyday. Saint Augustine says our sins will be forgiven and we will ascend to Heaven. That makes this Psalm admirable. Saint Ambrose calls it the glorious and useful Psalm, for the health of body and heart, saying it everyday counters temptations, if one says it three times a day, if one marks the Intelligence and character over one’s heart with linseed oil. The name of the Intelligence is Jendsel. The character is: "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 8 Psalm 101 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it whall not cleave to me. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord. Domine, exaudi orationem meam.....etc. David made this Psalm because the people of Israel, which were to be delivered by the arrival of Jesus Christ, as it is written in the Second Book of Macabees. This Psalm must be the seventh of the Penitential Psalms, with reason. Saint Jerome ensures that whoever says it, devotedly, everyday, will be marvelously consoled and healed of all afflictions. To make design of a woman who cannot be with child, it is necessary to write, with devotion, on white taffeta, the Intelligence and character, with the blood of a dove, and the woman must carry it always, hung around the neck. And when she lies with her husband, she must not fail to turn it behind her, to hang between her shoulder blades, so it lays along her spine. The name of the Intelligence is Silti or Silli, and this is the character: "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 9 Psalm 125 They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. As for such that turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel. De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine.....etc. One sang this Psalm with the second degree, whom the Church of God requests without delay, for the sinners, in order to erase the spots of their crimes. Saint Jerome says that David was converted by virtue, as well as the holy apostle, Paul, and the population, by God’s deliverance. Saint Augustine calls this Orison truly penitent, because it is useful for any death, other than gradual. It is good against storms and against temptation, and the same Saint says that this prayer has always been answered by God, when it has been said with devotion. It is used to have a revelation, in a dream, if one writes the Intelligence and character on three sheets of cedar, that are then put under the head on the bedside of the bed, and while entering there, the Psalm is said three times, and three times is said, “I request Hassar from you, that you show me, clearly, this night, the response I wish to know.” The name of the Intelligence is Stilu, and the character is:  "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 10 Psalm 142 I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. I looked upon my right hand, and behold, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. Domine, exaudi orationem meam.....etc. “To be used as instruction,” God says. He tells David that he would never be in His kingdom had he not made this Psalm, which is called the Tearful Misfortune, or Watery Orison, of David, by virtue of which he had all that he had been asked, because the Holy Spirit led in all actions. It’s virtue leads us by the Spirit of God, in all places, glorious, and filled with spiritual and temporal goods. Saint Jerome says that it gets the safety of body and soul of all other Psalms. It is penitential, and of great virtue. It is good for travelers, by sea and ground, and for those who seek to carry loads and dignity. If they are good people, the Holy Spirit will show them the way they must look, and keep the days the way they have said. Saint Jerome says to have it experiment with several others. It is good for those who wish to withdraw from the world, marry, or succeed in all things, because the Holy Spirit will lead them, by virtue of this Psalm. It is useful for prisoners to examine some of what is described in Psalm 141, as well. Note, that it is not necessary to persuade irreligious people, incredulous mockers, the grandiose, the miserly, the liars, and other sinners, or to envelope them in the darkness of ignorance, and in all human passions. They can eat of the fruit of the Divine Tree, because if one is curious enough to experiment, to satisfy their curiosity, it’s pleasure, it’s revenge, it’s avarice, it’s vanity, and other passions, that it succeed not with the intensity of it’s desires, it should not allot some of this to the Holy Work, but only make itself unworthy, by it’s crimes, because of the admirable grace and particular reserve for people who are good, and full of charity, piety, humility, and all other Divine Virtues. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 11 The Enchiridion of Pope Leo III A rare gift and correspondence from His Serenity, in the Vatican, to the Holy Emporer, Charlemagne, Holy Pope Leo, having rejoined and put together, with prayer and orison, and with the proper words and precepts of our Holy Mother Church, sent this to Charlemagne, saying: “if you believe firmly, without question, each day you will recite, with devotion, the following Orison, with respect, either in the house, or in war, or upon the sea, or any place you are, none of your enemies will have advantage over you. You will be invincible, and delivered of nastiness, illnesses, infirmities, and adversities. In the name of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, thus it is.” In favor and memory of King Charles, it was made in gold letters, which he always wore on himself, with great care, and with respect and devotion. Thus, no mortal can express the virtues of this Orison. If men knew the excellence and virtue of it, they would recite it each day with great devotion, and would never leave it, or give up on it. Moreso, those that have recited it, and then have given up on God, while their needs and necessities were met, they did not achieve their goals, and died unfortunately. The undeniable experiment made known, the few who recite it each day, with devotion, and who carry it on themselves with honor and respect, without any alteration of their bodies, and who have glory and praises for the All-Powerful God, for the glorious Virgin Mary, the Mother, and for all the Heavenly Court, will be preserved of iron, water, fire, and sudden death. The Devil will not have any capacity on him, nor will he die without confession. His enemies will have no advantage over him, that is to say, while sleeping, or in any place, either in or out of the way. He will never be overcome, nor be made captive. It is marvelous against tempests, the lightning and thunder. If one recites it over blessed water or earth, then sprinkles it, in the shape of a cross, at once the thunder and storms cease. If one is on the sea, and one recites it three times, the will have no trouble, nor accidents, nor storms that day. If one recite it three times over a person possessed by a malignant spirit, and by the light of a blessed candle, they will instantly be delivered. If a woman is in peril during the course of the work, recite three times, and by the light of a blessed candle, and she will be delivered. If someone wants to leave and go on a journey, he should recite it three times before leaving, or in front of himself, and carry it on himself on the voyage, and he will be delivered of any accident or sin. If he comes upon someone dying of a disease, he will be safe. This Orison is worthy of faith, and has been approved by several Popes. Here begins the mysterious orisons of Pope Leo III. ---------------------------------------- "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 12 Orison against all kinds of charms, enchantments, spells, characters (sigils and talismans), visions, illusions, possessions, obsessions, preventions, malefices of marriage, and all that can come to us by malefices of wizards or by incursions of devils, and also against all kinds of misfortunes that can be given to horses, mares, oxen, ewes, and such other species of animals.

Because the command I make you now is not mine, but that which has been at the center of Our Heavenly Father, in order to annihilate and destroy your malefices, which he did by his suffering on the tree of the Cross. He has given us the capacity to, thus, order you, by His glory, for utilization by the faithful ones. Thus, we defend against you, according to the capacities we received from Our Savior, Jesus Christ, and on His behalf, to approach this creature.

I heard talk of your renown, and the great wonders you perform, and the healings you make without remedies and safe herbs; that your word is enough to return sight to the blind man, to enable the lame to walk again, to cleanse lepers, and to drive out unclean spirits. You return health to those at a distance, and you resurrect the dead. Word of this has caused me to believe that you are the Son of God. That you can do these great things, has engaged me to write to you to request that you come to my country and return health to me, as I have a disease which will not leave.

To discover a thief Separately write on a piece of paper, all the names of those who are in the house, masters, servants, and others. Throw the tickets into clear water, in a full bronze pot, then over it, say, “I entreat you, Onazarde, Arogani, Labilafs, Parandamo, Azigola, Maractatam, Siranday, Eptaleton, Lamboured, make known to me the thief.” Then, if the thief’s name is in the pot, it will float on the water. If two or more do, then they are accomplices."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 53 Against Hemorrhoids It is necessary to push back, with the middle finger of the right hand, saying, each time, “Broka, broket, that God made me. I do not have them anymore, from Jesus. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Thus, it is.” Against the flow of blood Call, “Anna peririt Mariam, Elizabeth peririt, Joannem. Maria autem Christum. In nomine Jesu cesset sanguis ab hoc famulo vel ab hoc famula.” For a horse, angry or hurt, and very active Call, “Pater noster, etc..... until in coelo et in terra. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.” For the canker that arrives with beasts White canker, black canker, red canker, canker of all kinds, I command you, not to be on this head, in the same way the devil is to the priest, when he says the holy mass. Against diseases and wounds I know a sergeant of a village who says this Orison over all patients and wounded who present themselves to him and request him to say it. “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Holy Anna, whose child was the Virgin Mary, Virgin Mary, whose child was Jesus Christ. God, bless and heal this poor creature, N, of relapse, wounds, broken, and of obstacles, and of any kind of wound there is. In the honor of God, the Virgin Mary, Holy Come, and Holy Damian. Amen.” Then do three Pater and three Ave. One must consider this Orison eloquent and spiritual, that it has healed almost everyone, and has brought several people to the faith. For the evil of the eyes Saint John was passing by and there were three virgins on his way, and he said to them, ‘what are you doing here?’ They answered, ‘we are healing spots in the eyes.’ O healing virgins, heal the eyes of N. Make the sign of the cross while blowing in the eye. If spots continue, inflammation, scratches, migraines, and spider bites, I order you not to have power on these eyes, as the Jews had Passover over the body of Our Savior, Jesus Christ. One makes the sign of the cross while blowing in the eye. Order the patient to say three Pater and three Ave, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 54 For pain in the teeth Write these words and carry them around the neck, “Falcesque Stragiles dentate dentium dolarum persanate.” Divination by screen When one determines that one needs to know something secret, place the screen on two points of something like scissors. Two people, using the middle finger of the left hand, placed under the handles of the scissors, or where the screen is fastened. One supports it in the air, and the other states what they want to know, saying, “O sifter, you will turn if it is such and such thing,” then say, “Dies Mies Jeschet Benedoedet, Dowina Enitamau.” If the person named is guilty, the screen shakes and falls. If not, start again with another name. For a burn Our Holy Father goes away, and on his way, he finds a child, who shouts, “Father, who has this child? He is burning.” Take three, from the center of the slag, and spit three times, and the fire will go out. For decaying evil (probably like leprosy) Blow on the right corner of the decaying wound, and say these words, “Gaspar fert myrrham, thus, Melchior, Baltazar aurum.” The pain should be relieved immediately. To heal radically, three iron nails the length of the small finger are hidden where they will not fall. On each should be the name of the patient. Against foxes Call three times in the week, “in the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy Spirit, + all foxes, I command you, in the name of the very Holy One, and as Our Holy Lady was pregnant, you do not kill my birds or herd. That is to say, roosters, cocks, hens, and chickens, neither to eat them, their nests, nor break their eggs, or make any evil, etc.” Against wolves Call three times in the week, “in the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy Spirit, + all wolves, I command you, in the name of the very Holy One, and as Our Holy Lady was pregnant, you do not kill my birds or herd. That is to say, bulls, cows, calves, male and female sheep or goats, or all manner of birds. You will not frighten or cause terror, etc.” To be hard Write on two tickets, with your blood, what follows. “Ranuc + Malin + Fora consummatum est, in te confedo, Satana, +” Swallow one, and carry the other around your neck.
