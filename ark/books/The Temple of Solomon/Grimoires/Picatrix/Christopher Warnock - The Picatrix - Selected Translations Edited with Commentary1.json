Attributedto the Arabic author Al-Majriti, the Picatrixwas composed, according to the Arabictranslation that follows, between AD 954and 959. It was compiled, according to the preamble, from 200 previous works of magic,astrology and philosophy. Composed in Andalusia, Islamic Spain, it was translated intoCastilian and then Latin 1256 at the court of Alphonso the Wise of Castile. he Picatrix differs from other medieval and Renaissance grimoires or books ofmagic in being much more philosophical in orientation. Typical grimoires like theGreater and Lesser Keys of Solomon are almost entirely focused on practice, while Picatrixspends a great deal of time delving into the philosophical background behind magic. Picatrixalso stands apart in its heavy reliance on astrology, both as a means of timing the creation ofastrological talismans and as a universal method of classification. ur first translation from the Arabic Picatrix focuses on the relationship betweenthe One and the multiplicity of existent beings. Knowledge of this relationship,says Picatrix, is the key to magic.

They know not where to turn or evenwhat exactly they seek. Their lives are spent in searching for something that cannot be attain- because the wise have veiled it to shield the world from disaster (by the glory of this world,may God not let it happen!). Therefor they painted new images in the temples of Egypt.These new images were meant to stimulate the spirit, using secret signs and veiled formswhich would only be understood among the wise. Read between the lines, and dare tocompete with the wise, and thus the secrets are revealed. I have thus decided to make thisarea better known, to show the method of the art called “simija”; and to reveal the essentialsecrets of magic, just as we have previously done for the art of alchemy. divide this book in four parts. Each part contains several sections. The first part hasseven sections, one for each of the planets. The first section deals with the rank ofhonor of philosophy. I also discuss here of the constellations of the Heavens, and theirspecific configurations which are appropriate at the time of making particular talismans. Ialso discuss about the fixed stars and how they shine on the planets. I mention some thingswhich the wise, in their stinginess, have kept secret.he second section is about the Heavenly configurations and explains theirinfluences, both open and secret, which the wise have dimly expressed.Furthermore, it gives examples of the magic of this world (which is called the world ofgeneration and corruption) as derived from the world of the quintessence. This section laysout the basis of Plato's concept of the unity of form and matter.he third section discusss about the relationship of the stars to the three kingdoms ofmatter because only these are able to receive the influences of the heavens in theworld of generation and corruption.

I also discuss about the ways they blend with each other to accomplish thedesired effects for magic. This may be by the action of either elementary or physical warmth(either burning incense or putting cooked food or drink into the stomach). he fourth section is about the magic of the Kurds, Nabataeans, and Abyssinians. Itgives examples of various acts of magic - and I will fulfill this plan as it must bedone, without being miserly or hiding anything. And I ask to succeed in this enterprise,because it is in his hands. And with His protection I will begin.Chapter 1now, o my brother-- Allah enlightenedyour mind--: Philosophy is the noblest giftand the best remuneration. Philosophy gives theknowledge of First causes, on which the immediatecauses of existent things are based. This isaccomplished by reaching a true understanding of the essence of things, by realizing whatthey are and how they are; that they (with all their variations) lead, one after the other, toOne existence. This is the reason for all existent things, First causes as well as immediatecauses.nd this One is the true beginning, and its existence is not based on the existence ofany other thing. It is whole in itself and needn't win existence from anything else. Itis even impossible for it to win existence from another. It is also a priori impossible that it isTKA"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6in a body or is a body itself. Its existence is a different kind of existence. It has nothing incommon with any other existence. Something may appear similar but this is only in name,not in essence. It can only be one and that is the true One, that which unifies all existentthings. Because of this we can say that all existing things are one. It is the first reality. It giveseverything else reality. And its reality is whole in itself and needn't win reality from anythingelse. No one can imagine a greater completeness, nor could such exist. By philosophy onecan distinguish the separate ranks of existent things. Some are at the beginning, some in themiddle, and some at the end. The latter ones have motive, but don't motivate things belowthem. The ones in the middle find motivation above and also motivate things below them.But the first only motivate things below them. They aren't motivated by anything above. This is the essence of philosophy. What do you think now, O disciple, about a thingwhich is the way to itself? May Allah honor you: philosophy is big and wide. It is your title tohonor, and duty, to search for it. It illuminates the intellect and the soul through the light ofeternal beauty. If you search for it and grasp its essence and motivation, if you let go of thechanging & perishing world, you will be filled with desire to lift yourself up to the higherworld - the place of beginning and returning, from which you come, and where you alwayshave your place - so that Allah may comfort you and let you realize the cause of the world,and what the world causes. This is the basis on which the First Cause allowed causation toappear; the search for the highest is the connection between both. They will be realized asevident.ighty Allah is the cause of the world and the world is caused by him. Allahwants to make men his servants, so that they realize him and declare hisexistence.

And he protects andnourishes them; and they should thank him and prize him. He damns who he wills. Hedelights who he wills. Who he favors he keeps near him in endless happiness. Philosophy has three essential qualities. It is growing and not falling apart. It shines andnever darkens. And it reveals itself to be looked at, and never goes away. It has threeteaching powers: it pushes away evil, it ennobles, and it withdraws from whomever rejects it. Know now that the Arts couldn't exist without philosophy. That justifies calling the wiseconclusions. Conclusions are the final result of the logicians, the quintessence. The statutesof the two Arts were made to attract people to study the Science. None get to that exceptthe wise, who have mastered all the levels of philosophy already. At the end all becomesequivalent. I have offered you a wonderful secret. I hope that you understand it.Chapter 2now: here, this practice is called magic.Magic usually means all words or actionsthat bewitch the mind, and bring souls under theirspell. This is not easy to understand, and it's hiddenfrom the simpleminded. Magic is a divine power,affecting by original causes - which is basic to its understanding. There is also a practicalmagic. Its subject is the influence of spirit on spirit. We find this in the Nirendsch and theK"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8Phantasmagoria. The subject of the talismanic art is the influence of spirit on body. And thesubject of Alchemy is the influence of body on body. can say regarding the meaning of talismans [tilasm, tlsm] that it is the reverse of itsname [musalat, mslt - that which has power over another]. By its substances of powerand might the talisman affects and overwhelms its subject. The affect results from therelations between numbers, from the secrets of the sphere (which are manifested in certainbodies at certain times), and from incense burned for strength and to attract the pneuma thatbelongs to the talisman. It works like the second conclusion, called elixir, which has theability to change the bodies themselves by overwhelming them. It is an effective leavenwhich changes things from their original form. It acts as powerfully as poison. It canpenetrate any body similar to itself. Know that the elixir is a substance that changes intoitself everything it comes in contact with which is harmonious with it. But what is notharmonious with it will not be changed in this way. It is also said that these qualities makethe elixir different from all other natural bodies, which influence each other by their polarity.This is how it changes one individual into another by the power within it. Know, o brother,this leaven is an elixir which consists of earth, air, water, & fire. Whatever the leaven getsinto becomes the leaven, which then changes its own form. Its quality of porousness andability to fall apart easily make for an efficient digestion and conversion into nutrition.he elixir of Alchemy works the same way. It quickly changes the body into itself,radically altering its nature, purifying it, giving it spirit, soul, & solidity. It won't rotor develop a patina. This is supposedly the secret of the ancients. The word, al-iksir, means“capable of destroying all the powers that want to change it”. Al-iksir overwhelms them,making their substance into its own. They become alike. The animal, plant, & mineralIT"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"9kingdoms must be represented in the elixir because, as the ancients say, it represents a world,and the three kingdoms united make up the world. One leads another and supports it in itsgrowth. The plant can't exist by itself; the same for the animal, it needs the plant and otherthings. And the mineral needs cooking and fieriness, and the moistness of quicksilver, to becompleted. This is a secret that doesn't appear in “The Rank of the Philosopher”.ut I come back to our subject and say: magic is divided into two parts, theoreticaland practical. The theoretical part deals with the position of the fixed stars. Theirlocations, the way their rays fall upon the planets and the constellations in the sky, areimportant in determining their effect. In this context we must regard all ancient elections andtalismans. Know further: the nature of an election is such that one uses a talisman. The bestmethod of theoretical magic is speech. This is noted in the phrase of the Prophet, “Truly,some speech is magic.” And the great Plato means the same when he says in his book ofAphorisms, “The same way bad words can turn a friend into an enemy, an enemy canbecome a friend by good words.” Is that not magic?ractical magic involves knowledge of the three kingdoms, and the planetary powerswhich permeate them. These powers are called virtues. This name is given them bypeople who realize that they exist, but don't understand their cause or their true nature. It isnot necessary here to reveal the ancient secret. Further, the operation of practical magicinvolves the mixing of one kingdom with another. The warmth of the elements may beattained this way. This balances the incomplete powers with complete powers. A naturalwarmth may be attained as well. For both of these, both the animal & the human soul areneeded.BP"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10he art which is called Nirendsch is the most beautiful of magic. And know mybrother, some magic is useful, some is just an artistic performance. In thecategory of useful magic we find what is described by the sages of the eon of the Moon, andhinted at in the word of Allah, “Take four birds...”. Therefore this magic is useful. Under thecategory of magic as art performance we find the practices done in the eon of Saturn and inthe eon of Venus. The ancient Greeks gave Nirendsch and the transformation of tangiblethings the title, targih, literally “to make overweight”. Talismans they gave the title, syllogism,i.e., “pulling down the upper spirits”. All together they are called magic. The sagesdeveloped this science only through knowledge of the orb of the Heavens. The mostnecessary things to know about it are: understanding of the sphere of Allah's seat (called histhrone) and of the surrounding spheres; the zodiac signs, their locations in the sky, and theirother attributes; how the special characteristics of the twelve signs reflect the things of thisworld; the dignities of the planets in the Zodiac, and similarly connected things;understanding of the natures of the seven planets, the two nodes, their locations in the sky,and how their characteristic indices result in the world; also, understanding of the planetsand their interrelationships; the basic characteristics of the stargazer's art; and the dominantrulerships among the seven planets; the levels of rank among the seven planets; thecalculation of the omens and their location in the Zodiac.he summary above shows what knowledge is most necessary in the science of theorb of the Heavens. This science is to be found in books by specialists. The firstsage is referring to this knowledge when he says: “I am the one who was lifted above theseven spheres.” The expression, “lifted above the seven spheres”, means gaining a scientific T T"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"11understanding by the power of the mind. The same is taught in the word of Allah: \"We liftedhim to a high place.\"[al-Quran, Sura 19.]Chapter 3now, o reader, the sky is spherical. Its body iscompletely round; and every thing in the skyis also round, under every circumstance and at all times.Some people have said that sometime circumstances inthe sky will change its form; but such is impossiblebecause the form of the sky follows the form of its cause.he soul, also, has a spherical form; it has this form because it is the first thing,sufficient to itself. No evil existed yet; thus, the soul has perfect form. And theperfect form is the circle. It consists of one line because it is the One First Cause, and this isa mysterious thing. The Heaven itself is an actual creature. The degrees of it are only setthrough convention. We begin with the conventional grades; we then continue to theessential part. Usually the way of learning this goes the opposite direction. Learning aboutthe degrees leads to learning about the movements of the Heavens. It is not possible forsomething of the world of generation and corruption to be in any place in the Heavens, orvice versa, without recourse to violent action. As said before, the sphere of Heaven isperfectly regular in all directions. The circle is made of one curved line. In its center is apoint. All lines radiating from this point to the circumference have the same length. TheseKT"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"12lines are the paths of the rays of the stars to the world of the center. The operation oftalismans is based on this effect. That is the description or definition upon which peoplehave agreed. The Heavens are a sphere encompassing the whole world. Beyond the sphereit is neither full nor empty - there is no space. But the ether is at rest - we are pointed at it.Inside of it is the sphere of the fixed stars, except for its center. The center of the sphere offixed stars is next to the center of the Earth (as it is explained in the teaching of learning).he nature of the Heavens is unity. And the movements of all things that havenatures follow that of the Heavens and its warmth. These things are the accidentalresult of the Heavens (which motivate the generation of this world). The first division of thesky is into 360 degrees. 360 is also the number of the symbols of the degrees. The inneressence of the judgements of omens is based on them because the judgements aredetermined by the constellations. But some disagreed with that and said the sky doesn't haveany importance at all; all importance lies in the ether in the upper world (the world of starsand warmth). They go on to say that the symbols of the degrees are nothing but picturesformed by the constellations (groups of stars). But other people say that the essence of thescience of the stars (that is, the reason for the creation of things) is based on the symbols ofthe degrees.o determine the effect of a degree one must know the character of the planetaryinfluence upon earthly things. This must be known, for example, whenever a planetreaches any degree with a fixed star in it. Saturn moves the cold and dry existences; Jupiter,the hot and moist; Mars, the hot and dry. Venus moves existences of low heat and strongmoistness; Mercury, low heat and strong dryness. The Moon moves the cold and moistexistences. The same principle holds for the fixed stars.

Thispoint is difficult and full of obscurity, according to the ancient wise men. The obscurity oftheir speech is such that they camouflage the outside and cover the inside. This is called“igmad” (from “agmada” which means ‘obscure talking’); this you should know.Chapter 4ver since talismans were first needed it has beennecessary to know of the constellations, onwhich the art and effect of talismans are based. Andhere I will give you basic rules about theseconstellations, and this astronomical foundation oftalismans, on which you can build.ne who makes a talisman has to know how to use the Ephemeris. And further,one must believe strongly that what one is doing is right. There can be no doubtsor uncertainties in one's operation so that the effect of one's “rational soul” may be strongand the will of the World's “rational soul” may reach this world of generation and corruptionand cause the desired result.nd I will give you a firm rule for the planet closest to our Earth: you should notperform any operation unless the Moon is in a fortunate position for it.

This is the behavior of a loser, as he is too weak to resist. This actionmanifests if strength and weakness are in confrontation with each other. This action, ornature, is necessary when creating a talisman because not every material takes everyinfluence. This is a basic rule agreed by the wise. If the nature is appropriate and thereforethe material is able to receive, then it will receive, and then union will occur which results inthe desired effect.

Know this, andunderstand it clearly. It is my hope, as I write this, to discover what our predecessors keptsecret. Allah, the Sublime, will only allow those he favors to have access to these secrets. COMMENTARY his translation from the Arabic Picatrix beginswith a discussion of the One, in the Christian andIslamic traditions equated with God and/or Allahrespectively. We can see this as the Arabic text switchesfrom discussing the One to discussing Allah in Book I,Chapter 1 and attributes desires and even personality toAllah. However, as the Picatrix makes clear the One isnot a being, but rather that which underlies being. In discussing the attributes of the One,the Picatrix is not merely spinning superlatives, saying that God, and of course, our tribal orperson god, is very, very large and very powerful, but rather attempting to point the readerto a philosophical and in fact, experiential breakthrough. The One is not a person or apersonality, it is probably better conceptualized as the Tao. Picatrix then emphasizes thereliance of all things on the One and the value of the search for knowledge. Thisphilosophical approach, rooted in this view of reality as dependent on the One and thusdespite the appearance of multiplicity and an seeming infinity of disconnected things is, infact, unified and in the end, united in the One. The search for connections and the returnof the many to the One will be the basis of the astrology and magic propounded in Picatrix. T"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"24n Book I, chapter 2 Picatrix discusses three kinds of magic, magic or illusionary magic,which Picatrix says is the “the influence of spirit on spirit.” Then astrologicaltalismans which Picatrix says involve the action of “spirit on body.” And finally alchemy,which Picatrix says is the, “the influence of body on body.” This is a very interesting anduseful classification of magic. First of all, magic or the creation of illusion operates by theaction of the spirit of the magician on the spirits of his subjects. This means that stagemagic or even card tricks are properly considered as real magic since they involve theproduction of illusions nevertheless the subjects see and experience as real events. This alsotakes in what I refer to as mass media magic, which is exemplified in the Renaissance byGiordano Bruno. Coulianu, in his Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, says of this form of magicthat, we would tend to say that the two other practitioners of Bruno’s magic, theactual magician and prophet have now vanished. More probably, however, theyhave simply camouflaged in sober and legal guises...Nowadays the magicianbusies himself with public relations, propaganda, market research, sociologicalstudies, publicity, information, counterinformation and misinformation,censorship, espionage and even cryptology...1econdly Picatrix discusses talismanic magic and says that it is the action of spirit onbody. This is also a very incisive way to explain astrological magic because thecreation of talismans involves searching throughout the material world for disparate, butspiritually connected items, making use of the spiritual unity of all things. This is one waythat spirit exists in body, through the reliance of material things on their souls or spiritualessences, themselves dependent on the Platonic Ideas or Archetypes, often seen in theMiddle Ages and Renaissance as angels or archangels.

Finally, Picatrix says that alchemy is the action of body on body. ThePhilosphical Elixir, the Philospher’s Stone acts by transmuting impure matter to thequintessence, matter purified. These systematic classification of esoteric arts in an almostsyllogistic manner is typical of Picatrix’s approach and extremely useful both inunderstanding and applying these various esoteric arts. n chapter three Picatrix takes what might be termed a “scientific” approach, though ascience that encompasses the spiritual. He discusses the nature of the Heavens, whichproceeding from the perfect one, must themselves be perfect and thus circular or sphericalin shape. Talismans, says Picatrix, work through this unity within the spherical perfection ofthe Cosmos through straight lines, similar to the spiritual rays described by the medievalIslamic philosopher Al-Kindi in his On the Stellar Rays. Picatrix then discusses the variouselemental influences of the planets, those that are fiery, Mars & the Sun, producing heat anddryness, those that are airy, Jupiter, producing heat and moisture, those that are wet, theMoon & Venus, producing cold and moisture and those that are earthy, Saturn and Mercury,producing cold and dryness. This medieval and Renaissance “scientific” astrology was nevermaterialistic, in the sense of excluding the spiritual, but its emphasis was also on impersonalforces. It coexisted with and supplemented the more esoteric view of the spiritual and spiritsas personalities. Picatrix, in the sophistication of its philosophical approach, takes in both“scientific” astrology and the more overt emphasis on spirits. These approaches are notreally contradictory, and the “scientific” approach cannot be seen, without significantdistortion, as some sort of forerunner to modern materialistic science.

Early on the measurement of the Mansions throughobservation of particular fixed stars was replaced with a Tropical set of Mansions, orientedto the Tropical Zodiac of the seasons.

On the eastern gate he placed the form of anEagle; on the western gate, the form of a Bull; on the southern gate, the form of a Lion, andon the northern gate, the form of a Dog.

First an image for the talisman isgiven and then often the materials to be used and finally the astrological conditions underwhich the talisman must be created or the image inscribed or engraved. We have alreadynoted the dependence of all material things on the One, mediated through the rays or spiritsof the stars, which themselves depend on the Platonic Ideas or Archetypes, perfectexemplars of every thing and every relationship. Thus using materials ruled by a particularplanet, in other words materials that contain the energy of the planet, now scatteredthroughout the material world, makes sense as a method of concentrating that energy.Alternatively we can consider the things ruled by the planet as things that it loves and isattracted to. The concentration of these things impels the spirit of the planet to manifestitself within them. he proper selection of astrological conditions is also a key part of astrological magic.To charge a talisman with the energy of a planet, that planet must itself be strongTWT"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"33and well placed. Typically in Picatrix we are advised that the planet should be rising and thatit should be in either its sign or exaltation. Also typical of planetary elections is the frequentadmonition to make the talisman in the hour of the planet. This just scratches the surface ofthe astrological knowledge necessary to elect, that is, to pick an astrological auspicious timefor a particular talisman. Mastery of traditional (pre-1700) electional astrology is aprerequisite to the proper application of the instructions given in Picatrix. If you do notknow what modern astrology is or are not aware of the differences between traditional andmodern, then ipso facto you are a modern astrologer. Be cautious for modern astrology, forall its virtues, will lead you astray. Find a teacher and learn the traditional method, withoutmodern inclusions. he third factor in the creation of planetary talismans are the images prescribed byour sources. Originally these talismans were often made as statuettes, so statuettewould be made in the form of the image. However, inscribing or engraving the images onpendants or rings, currently the most popular method, was also widespread in medieval andRenaissance practice. On one hand, there is a tendency for moderns to become obsessedwith the material form and appearance of talismans to the exclusion of astrological timing.“Talismans” available on the Internet are generally nothing more than factory massproduced base metal jewelry with various designs. While the design alone is not sufficientfor much magical charge, it would also be a mistake to ignore the importance of these forms,though our emphasis must change from a material to a spiritual perspective. When we consider the Renaissance view of the Cosmos as being composed of three worlds,the World of Divine Ideas & Archetypes, often seen as Archangels, the Celestial World andthe Material World, it is important to realize that the Celestial World is not necessarily thatT"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"34of the material planets and stars. In Renaissance and medieval thought the planets and starswere made of a different matter than things in the sub-lunary sphere. Modern science iscertainly correct in disputing this and maintaining that the matter of stars is the same asmatter on Earth. However, we should remember that these ideas of stellar matter camefrom the traditional “scientific” viewpoint, which existed along with a more esoteric, spiritualapproach whose focus had always been on the Archangels or Souls of the planets and stars,rather than their material bodies. This approach is not as affected by the modern scientificview of stellar matter. For this esoteric approach, the Celestial World is perhaps betterunderstood as the Alam al-Mithal, the Imaginal World. Not imaginary, and not created bythe individual ego, but rather the intermediate world of dreams and visions, where thearchetypes and spirits take on form and material things lose their weight and spatial qualities. The images that Picatrix describes to us are therefore the products of this Celestial Worldand presumably perceived by sages in dream, vision and direct transmission from spirits inritual and invocation. In reading the image descriptions, some are very odd, some strangelyfamiliar and all have that otherworldly quality of Celestial visions. e are privileged to have Nigel Jackson’s renditions of these images. As a mageand artist Nigel works daily with the Imaginal World. He sees himself, not inthe modern artistic mold as the rebel genius, individually creating “art” through his ego self,but rather in the more traditional model of the vessel of manifestation for forms and imagesthat pre-exist him and have their origin and subsistence outside of him. For us these imagesare windows into the realms of the various spirits they depict and doorways for themanifestation of these spirits.

Here we see a very broad application ofthe principles of astrological magic. As we have seen talismans could consist of statues andstatuettes as well as pendants and rings. But here Picatrix describes an entire cityconstructed on astrological talismanic principles. From the four gates of the citycorresponding to the fixed signs of the Zodiac; Scorpio, whose higher qualities aresometimes depicted as an eagle, Leo, the Lion, Taurus, the Bull and Aquarius, here depictedas a dog; to the temple of the Sun and the 7 changing colors on the tower at the center ofthe city, astrological planning and magical power pervade the city of Hermes. This point usto a larger interior and exterior design through astrological principles, to magical landscaping,architecture and even city planning. The principles that allow us to create small personaltalismans are equally applicable to the creation of sacred space on a very large scale. Thepervasive modern condition of detachment and meaninglessness, as well as the massdestruction of the environment all potentially have their antidote in recognizing the spiritualordering of the Cosmos.

This level of sophistication was attained by the HarranianSabians, pagan followers of Hermes Trismegistus who survived into the medieval period andtransmitted much of their esoteric knowledge to the advanced Islamic civilization of theMiddle East. We have seen that in making planetary talismans we seek to elect a time whenthe particular planet is strong, to get the basic energy of the planet. House based talismansare much more complex and mysterious. A planet and thus a planetary talisman always hasthe same basic effect for everyone. Houses, however, are divisions of local space and varydepending on the time of day and location. These house rulers are like cast members of aplay with various roles to play which they change among themselves depending on the time,date and location. A planet when acting as a house ruler is often very different from its basicnature. Jupiter, for example, the Greater Benefic, when he is the ruler of the 8th house, thehouse of death, kills just as effectively as the Malefics, Saturn and Mars. Still, his basic naturestill comes into play because Jupiter ruling the 8th house gives a death by natural causes,rather than by violent means2. house talisman very emphatically reminds us, as Picatrix states in Book I, Chapter2, that the creation of a talisman involves the action of spirit on body. TheRenaissance mage Cornelius Agrippa says,But know this that such images work nothing, unless they be so vivified thateither a naturall or Celestiall, or Heroicall, or animasticall, or demoniacal, orangelicall vertue be in them, or assistant to them. But who can give a soul to animage, or make a stone to live, or mettal, or wood, or wax? and who can raise   2 John Gadbury, Doctrine of Nativities (London, 1658) at 144.IA"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"47out of stones children unto Abraham?

Its body being what weconsider the talisman, a pendant, ring or statuette, and its soul being infused into it throughthe appropriate planetary house rulers. n terms of electional instructions Picatrix gives us many specific and interestingexamples of magical technique. One is to make two talismans for a particular purposeand to connect the talismans by making the Ascendant of the talisman for the person to beaffected same sign or even degree of sign of the appropriate house cusp of the othertalisman. To make a talisman for love, the 7th house of the 1st talisman becomes the 1st ofthe 2nd talisman; they are connected by love. To make a talisman for friendship, the 11thhouse of the 1st talisman becomes the Ascendant of the 2nd talisman; they are connected byfriendship. Another way to connect the talisman to the person the mage seeks to affect is tomake the Ascendant of the talisman the same as the Ascendant of the person to be affected.Picatrix also advises us to make the talisman in the form and image of the person to beaffected, in other words to use their picture on a flat talisman or to make a statuette thatlooks like them. Finally Picatrix also advises that dual talismans be bound together. All ofthese are what moderns call sympathetic magic, but philosophically they are understandablewhen we consider the unity of the Cosmos and everything within it remembering thateverything is not equally or as powerfully connected to everything else. Instead, things of asimilar form, since form descends from the Archetypes, the Divine Ideas or Archangelic   3 Cornelius Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, Book II, Chapter 50.I"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48Realm, into the Celestial World and from thence to material things.

We have already alluded to the process of ensoulment which proceedsby enticing the spirit of the desired astrological factor to infuse the talisman with its energyor in an alternative formulation to inhabit the talisman. Consecration proceeds best themore factors that contain the energy of the planet, or contain the Divine Idea or Archetypemanifested through the planet, are assembled. This includes the materials used in makingthe talisman and its design as well as appropriate clothing, incense and even the attitude andactions appropriate to the planet. The Renaissance philosopher and astrological mageMarsilio Ficino says, ...let no man wonder that [the World] Soul can be allured as it were by materialforms, since she herself has created baits of this kind suitable to herself, to beallured thereby, and she always and willingly dwells in them. There is nothing tobe found in this whole living world so deformed that Soul does not attend it,that a gift of the Soul is not in it.4 Thus the astrological mage collects materials and things that are ruled by the planet or otherastrological factor.

Then in ritual and invocation the Spirit of the planet, fixed star, Mansionof the Moon or other astrological factor is called upon and communicated with, furtherincreasing the connection to the Divine Idea or Archetype. Thus the incense and othermaterials listed in the ritual preparation translation section are key to the success of thecreation of the talisman. Even the actions and dress of the mage contribute to the processof attracting the appropriate spirit and ensouling the talisman, infusing the talisman with thespiritual power of the desired Angelic Archetype.        4 Marsilio Ficino, Three Books on Life, Bk.

Having chosen the proper time and materials we now callupon the appropriate spirit to infuse and ensoul the talisman. We have already discussedhow the spirit is enticed to dwell in the talisman by the choice of appropriate materials ruledby it, containing the same Divine Archetype or Platonic Idea that it contains. Invocation,however, can also be seen as a dual process in which the spirit is called upon to dwell in thematerial realm and the mage raises themselves up into the realm of the spirit. While traditional astrologers did think of the geocentric “Earth centered” astronomy as aaccurate model of physical astronomy, our current views of the heliocentric structure of theSolar System do not alter the geocentric model of the spiritual Cosmos. We are not, ofcourse, invoking the physical body, the material aspect of the planets, but their spirits orsouls, often seen in traditional sources as angels and archangels or intelligences. To bringourselves into their spheres is not to physical go into outer space, but a journey into theimaginal realm. This middle realm, known in Islamic mysticism as the Alam al Mithal, wasthe intermediate between the Divine World of Archetypes and the Material World, wherethe Divine Ideas took on form and the material things lost their materiality and became onlyform. This is the world of visions, dreams and of magic which we are never out of contactwith on a deep level, but usually are unconscious of.

Instead theritual is in a very devotional form in which the spirit is described, usually in praise, but theritual does not shrink from accurately setting forth the less admirable qualities of the planets.There are not infrequent allusions to the Lord of the Highest Edifice and to a divinity at alevel higher than and more powerful than the planets and requests and even commands aremade in the name of this entity, but nevertheless the whole tone of the Picatrix invocations isvery different from most grimoires. For the most part this is due to the type of entities thatare being invoked since the astrological spirits are of a higher and purer sphere. Whatevertheir negative qualities and the malefic magic that can be done through their power, these arenot in essence, evil or malignant spirits. The protective circle is not necessary so long as theproper respect is paid. A formal contract of X for Y typical of Goetic magic is not used withthe astrological spirits. Instead, paying respect particularly through candles, incense andofferings are rewarded by the spirits. My sense of the astrological spirits is of very powerfulbeings who can be approached and who will bestow their blessings on those who are faithfuland respectful.

This is the true prayer ofthe planets that the Roman wise men were accustomed to make during the year, specificallyfor Jupiter. COMMENTARY any of the Picatrix rituals follow traditional pagan practice and involve animalsacrifice, so this Jupiter ritual is an interesting variation, more conducive tomodern sensibilities. This Jovial feast ritual is attributed to the Roman wise men which isappropriate given the prominence of Jupiter in Roman religion. The election itself is alsointeresting, using the planetary day of Jupiter, Thursday, but then placing the Sun in the signsof Jupiter, which makes this an annual ritual tied to the seasons, rather than somethinghappening over a longer period every 12 years or so, as Jupiter passes through his signs. TM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"70The selection of incense is typical Jovial as is the use of tin, the metal of Jupiter for theincense burner. But it is the preparation of the Jovial feast that is particularly interesting.Marsilio Ficino, in his Three Books on Life notes that foods with palpable and subtle sweettastes belong to Jupiter,In this class belong the essential nature of sweet almond, the pine nut, the hazel-nut, the pistachio-nut, of starch, licorice, raisins, yolk of egg, of the meat of thebarnyard chicken, of pheasants, peacocks, of partridges and of similaranimals...likewise that of fragrant, sparkling wine, somewhat sweet andastringent, or of the most glistening white sugar and the whitest wheatflour...This is in truth the substance and sweetness peculiar to Jupiter, which isabove all truly useful for creating and restoring the spirit.5The use of these Jovial foods along with repeated invocations of Jupiter substitute verynicely for animal sacrifice. The completion of the ritual with a feast of friends is similarlyJovial in nature and seems a perfect example of a Jupiter ruled event. Despite the prevalence of animal sacrifice, and there can be no doubt that the death of aliving and sentient being is a source of power, this is one area in which modern sensibilitiesdo seem to be more advanced than many traditional ones. I cannot feel that it is appropriatefor me to benefit from inflicting pain and death on another living being. And indeed giventhe Hermetic/Neoplatonic view of the connection of all things through their creation by theOne and the transmigration of souls we have a traditional philosophical basis for valuing andindeed treasuring the existence of all living beings. In hurting and killing another I am, in avery real sense, inflicting pain upon myself. Thus while animal sacrifice is a part oftraditional practice, it is not integral and its purposes, to contact and honor the gods andspirits can be accomplished through other means while staying within the framework oftraditional philosophy.

Thesame showed their disciples all the science and the philosophical subtilities on the outside ofthe operations concerning the spirits of the Perfect Nature. They indeed called the spirits ofthis Perfect Nature by the four following names: Meegius, Betzahuech, Vacdez,Nufeneguediz, four elements which are the names of this spirit of the above-mentionedPerfect Nature.nd when these sages had need of this Perfect Nature, they called upon these fournames, names which signify the puissance of the Perfect Nature.Hermes in addition said “When I wanted to understand and draw the arcana of the work ofthe world and of its qualities, I placed myself above a cave-mouth very deep and obscure,whence was released a violent wind; I could not see there because of the darkness. Andwhen I carried a flaming candle into it, at once the wind extinguished it. Then a beautifulman, of imperious authority, appeared to me in dream: he spoke to me as follows: ‘Take thelit candle and place it in a glass lantern so that the violence of the wind does not extinguishit.

I asked him by which name one called him. And he: ‘I am called and named’, hereplied to me ‘by the four aforesaid names, and, when you call me by them, I will answeryou.’ again asked him at which moment to call him and what to do to invoke.

He says then ‘When you have realise the aforesaid operationin the manner preceding, you will see me’”his operation is revealed in the book called ‘Astimiquem’.

The ceremony of invocation indicates that if successfully performedthe Perfect Nature of the mage appears to them in a personified form. But what is thisPerfect Nature? Our first clue comes from the Latin term itself, natura completa, which can betranslated as Perfect or perfected nature or as completed, filled or complete nature. Picatrixsays that Perfect Nature consists first of the power of understanding of a wise man which isnot innate but is infused into him through a process of descent from what Picatrix callsspirits on high. This is reminiscent of the Platonic Ideas which were often personified asarchangels or Intelligences. Perfect Nature, however, also has an ascending phase whichconsists of the spirit of understanding of the mage bound together with the spirit of theplanet ruling in his natal chart. What this process appears to entail, therefore, is a unity ofdescent and ascent and a mirroring both of the unity of the One. Perfect Nature appears asa classic process of embodying within the mage the unity of Macrocosm and the Microcosm.This unification brings first and foremost wisdom, but also knowledge and the ability to domagical works. Agrippa also speaks of this process and refers to it as the dignification,...but now we will declare a mysticall and secret matter, necessary for every onewho desireth to practize this art, which is both the beginning, perfection and keyof all Magicall operations, and it is the dignifying of men to this so sublimevertue and power...Therefore it is meet that we who endeavor to attain to sogreat a height should especially meditate of two things; first how we shouldleave carnall affections, fraile sense, and materiall passions. Secondly, by whatway and means we may ascend to an intellect pure & conjoyned with the powersof the gods, without which we shall never happily ascend to the scrutiny ofsecret things, and to the power of wonderfull workings, or miracles.6What is particularly interesting about Picatrix’s discussion of Perfect Nature is that the ascentto the One is not performed through the same route for everyone, but differs depending onthe ruler of the natal chart, in traditional astrological terminology referred to as the Almuten"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"77or Almutem Figuris. Thus there are seven basic paths to the One for each of the seventraditional planets. he medieval astrologer Abraham Ibn Ezra gives a method for determining theAlmuten Figuris. First the four Hylegical places are found in the chart. These arethe degree of the Sun, the Moon, the Ascendant, the Part of Fortune and the PrenatalSyzygy, the Full or New Moon immediately previous to birth. Usually the normal essentialdignity almuten calculation the dignity points for all planets over these five Hylegical placesare added up. Then the planetary day ruler is given 7 points and the planetary hour ruler isgiven 6 points. Each planet in the chart is then given points for the house it occupies, with12 points for the 1st house, 11 for the 10th, 10 for the 7th, 9 for the 4th, 8 for the 11th, 7 for the5th, 6 for the 2nd, 5 for the 9th, 4 for the 8th, 3 for the 3rd, 2 for the 12th and 1 for the 8th. All ofthese points, for the five Hylegical places, the planetary day and hour and the houses areadded and the planet with the highest point score is the Almuten Figuris. It is this planetthat the mage must seek to unite with in order to achieve their Perfect Nature. Thusthrough finding the Almuten Figuris and through the invocation set forth in Picatrix which ispart of the dignification which Agrippa explains, the mage becomes a mirror of theascending and descending motion of the Cosmos and a mirror of the One, capable of worksof magic.        6 Cornelius Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, Bk III, ch 3.T"}]
