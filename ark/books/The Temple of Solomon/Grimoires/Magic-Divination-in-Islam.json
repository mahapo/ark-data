In Goldziher's time it was possible for scholars to work with the whole of the field and practically all of its available sources, but more recently the in-''''easing sophistication of scholarly methodologies, a broad diversification in research interests, and a phenomenal burgeoning of the catalogued and published source material available for study have combined to generate an illcreasing \"compartmentalisation\" of research into very specific areas, each with its own interests, priorities, agendas, methodologies, and controversies. While this has undoubtedly led to a deepening and broadening of our un-derstanding in all of these areas, and hence is to be welcomed, it has also t.ended to isolate scholarship in one subject from research in other areas, and even more so from colleagues outside of Arab-Islamic studies, not to mention \"llIdents and others seeking to familiarise themselves with a particular topic for the first time. The Formation of the Classical Islamic World is a reference series that ,ceks to address this problem by making available a critical selection of the published research that has served to stimulate and define the way modern scholarship has come to understand the formative period of Islamic history, for these purposes taken to mean approximately AD 600-950. Each of the volumes in the series is edited by an expert on its subject, who ha.s chosen a IIlImber of studies that taken together serve a.s a cogent introduction to the state of current knowledge on the topic, the issues and problems particular t.o it, and the range of scholarly opinion informing it. Articles originally pub-lished in languages other than English have been translated, and editors have provided critical introductions and select bibliographies for further reading. A variety of criteria, varying by topic and in accordance with the judge-ments of the editors, have determined the contents of these volumes. In some cases an article has been included because it represents the best of current scholarship, the \"cutting edge\" work from which future research seems most likely to profit. Other articles-certainly no less valuable contributions-have been taken up for the skillful way in which they synthesise the state of scholarly knowledge. Yet others are older studies that-if in some ways now superseded-nevertheless merit attention for their illustration of thinking or conclusions that have long been important, or for the decisive stimulus"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"XII ----...

Chapters from single author monographs have been considered only in very exceptional ca.ses, and a certain emphasis has been encouraged on important studies that are less readily available than others. In the present state of the field of early Arab-Islamic studies, in which it is routine for heated controversy to rage over what scholars a generation ago would have regarded as matters of simple fact, it is clearly essential for a series such a.s this to convey some sense of the richness and variety of the approaches and perspectives represented in the available literature. An ef-fort has thus been made to gain broad international participation in editorial capacities, and to secure the collaboration or colleagues I'''presenting differ-ing points of view.

The interests and priorities of the editors, and indeed, of the General Ed-itor, will doubtless be evident throughout. Hopefully, however, the various volumes will be found to achieve well-rounded and representative synthe. ses useful not as the definitive word on their subjects-if, in fact, one can speak of such a thing in the present state of research-but as il1troductiullo comprising well-considered points of departure for more detailed inquiry. A series pursued on this scale is only fea.sible with the good will and cooperation of colleagues in many areas of expertise. The General Editor would like to express his gratitude to the volume editors for the investment of their time and talents in an age when work of this kind is grossly undervalued, to the translators who have taken such care with the articles entrusted to them, and to Dr John Smedley and his staff at Ashgate for their support, assistance and guidance throughout. Lawrence I. Conrad T , I i I I INTRODUCTION Magic and Divination in Early Islam Emilie Savage-Smith THERE ARE NEARLY as many definitions of magic and ?ivin~tion as ~h.ere V are people writing on the subject. Attempts at an all-Inclu~lve definitIOn tend to reflect the concerns of the person writing, whether philologICal, the-ological, historical, or anthropological. Moreover, mos~ modern attempts to define magic and divination in Islam have been made In terms of European practice, which nearly always invokes forces other than God. Man~ Euro-V pean concepts such as ghosts, necromancy, and witchcraft, have httle or no counterpar~ in Islam, while the empl(}l'l1lent_(),Ldic.hotollliesoiten us.cd to characterize European practices (high v. low,.white v. black, learned;. \\ p-\"J)ular,prayer~-v. spells) is to a large extent inappropriate in the Islanll~ .. context. I' . I When characterizing magic and divination, a contrast of t le IrratlOna. with the rational is often evoked. However, what today. may be. ~eel~ed irrational was not always thought to be so, while both_J11\",glcand dlVlnatJOn can be viewed as a form of rationality wlJ;h .It,s-'''''!L''''l..oLass~II1J?tions, ~ased_ upon a(j}focess of analowrather than proven causes and effects. . Medieval Islamic writers, as well as modern scholars, have cate~onzed and enumerated various beliefs and practices under the general headings of s*r (magic) or kihiina (divination).l Yet the boundaries between the c~te­gories are indistinct and shifting. Si!>r, for example, could apply to a~ythlllg wondrous, including elegant and subtle poetry, to sleight-of-h.and tncks, .to the healing properties of plants, to invocations to God for asslstan~e, to Ill-vocations to jinn or demons or the spirits of pladets, and on occasJO~ even to the divinatory art of astrology.

The articles selected for inclusion in this volume have been arranged in roughly the same manner, and they all include extensive refer-ences to earlier studies. The bibliography provided at the end of this essay is intended as an introductory guide to both topics, sharing many of the modern scholarly resources and methodologies. Resources and Methodologies For many, if not most, of the practices, our sources come from a later period (post-twelfth century) when the procedures and techniques had become well defined and often quite intricate. Teasing out the nature of practices and beliefs in the first centuries of Islam is both difficult and highly speculative. For early Islam, when pre-Islamic practices were being incorporated into Muslim society, we have to rely on sources such as (,ad,th, early dictionaries, chronicles, and writings not solely devoted to magic or divination. Most historians of the subject, however, have focused upon later formal treatises on magic or divination, and for the early period (the eighth to early eleventh centuries) we are fortunate in having editions and translations of pertinent astrological treatises by al-I(jlldT (d. ca. AD 870) and Abu Ma'shar (d. ca. AD 893) and the magical compilation commonly known as the Picatrix. There are, however, relatively few synthetic studies whose primary focus is magic or divination in early Islam, aside from the valuable work of John Lamoreaux.2 Often, however, there are insights relevant to the earlier period to be found in studies based on material originating after the eleventh century. The tield has not been well served by bibliographers, except for divina-tion (excluding astrology) in the work of Toutic Fahd.3 The topics of magic and divination are only occasionally included in Carl Brockelmann's multi-volume Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur (1889-1949) and (with the ex-ception of early astrology and astrometeorology) completely overlooked by Fuat Sezgin in his continuation and supplement to Brockelmann.4 For magic in general and for astrology (but not other forms of divination), the basic 2 John C.

Only a few of the studies in these two volumes will be singled out for mention in what follows, but both should be consulted in their entirety. There are masses of pertinent manuscripts in libraries, but very few have been published or studied, or even catalogued. Additional sources, such as material from the Geniza, are becoming available, though they have not yet been employed extensively by historians of the subject.6 Artefacts and ma-terial remains are another potential source, and major collections of Islamic amulets have been compiled in the last two centuries, but while there have been some descriptive publications, there has been relatively little historical analysis.7 In any case, there are problems of interpretation regarding artefacts and material remains. For example, do we know their intended use? If so, how is it to be interpreted? There are artefacts that are not reflected in any written sources (magic bowls being an example), and there are occasional disparities between preserved text and artefact. For example, stone-books providing instructions for elaborate magical figures and formulae to be engraved on .5Manfred Ullmann, Die Natu,.. uuri Geheimwissenscha/ten '111 Islam (Leiden, 1972; Handbuch der Orientalistik, I.vi.2), 271-358, 359-426. 6Peter Schafer and Shaul Shaked, eds., Magische Texte aus del' I<airoer Ceniza, 3 vols.

Magic if Most magic in the early Islamic world was protective in nature, asking for God's general beneficence. Occ .. ,ionally, His intervention against other powers-the evil eye, assorted devils (shayatin) and demons (jinn, \"shape-shifting\" supernatural creatures the existence of which was already recog-nized in the Q'Ul\"an)-was specifically sought, This underlying assumption of the existence of evil beings, including a pantheon of demons, was inher-ited from pre-Islamic societies, as were many of the methods of counteracting them. The study by Edmond Doutt\", prepared nearly a century ago, is still useful as a general guide to magical practices in Islam.14 The recent study by Dorothee Pielow, though b .. sed on a thirteenth-centUl'Y text, is highly usefuLl5 Also of use is the chapter on magic from the Muqaddima of Ibn of Islamic Geomancy with a Critique of a Structuralist's Approach\", Studio Islamico, 49 (1979). 5-38, 12See, for example, Lee Siegel, Net 0/ Magic: Wonders and Deceptions in India (Chicago., 1991); Ariel Glucklich, Th, End of Mogic (Oxford, 1997).

For a general background to pre-Islamic magical beliefs, the chapter on \"Pagans and Gnostics\" by Michael Morony in his book Iraq after the Muslim Conquest is highly useful24 For Aramaic magical practices the work of Joseph Naveh and Shaul Shaked is indispensable.25 On the difficulty of disentangling the various influences, see the article by Peter Joosse26 Many of these pre-Islamic beliefs and practices were assimilated into the emerging Islamic culture. Pre-Islamic magical imagery featuring lions, serpents, and scorpions can be seen on several types of magical artefacts, such as amulets and magic-medicinal bowls. There was concern for sudden death (associated with the evil eye)-explaining a nexus of symbols (scor-pion/serpent/mad dog) that occur on the earliest amulets, all of which could be interpreted as omens of sudden death. Astrological iconography derived1 from classical antiquity, involving emblematic representations of the twelve ( zodiacal signs and the seven planets, also played a role in talismanic desigll.-.\\ The employment of special occult properties of plant, animal, and min-eral substances continued an established late antique practice.

Curse tablets (usually written on lead, rolled up, and hidden) are rela-tively common artefacts from Graeco-Roman culture, but few traces remain amongst Islamic artefacts. Binding spells continued to playa role, as they did in late antiquity, but perhaps can be seen to be of somewhat less impor-tance.

Ibn Khaldun, writing in the fourteenth century, provided a particularly full \"his-tory\" of magical knowledge.32 For him, the definitive summary of everything known about ma.gic and sorcery was the Ara.bic magical-astrological treatise compiled around 1004, the Chityat al-iwkim, commonlyknownas the Pica-trix, that was falsely attributed to the Spanish astronomer al-Majrlp' (d. ca. 1i01!r--fne Arabic text has been edited and translated into German, but a new edition and full study comparing it with the Latin tradition would be welcome.33 For most later writers, the acknowledged authority in the field of magic was the Egyptian AI!mad ibn 'All al-Bunl, who is said to have died in 1225.

The prayers, Qur'anic verses, pious phrases, and invocations, often em-ploying the 99 \"Beautiful Names of God\" (al-asma' al-!tusna)41 or names of angels, applied to magical objects were supplemented by an array of symbols whose function was to strengthen the supplications. Many of these symbols were inherited from earliel' cultures, and their origins and significance have become obscure with the passage of time. The earliest surviving talismanic objects reflect pre-Islamic magical sym-bolism: for example, a long-horned stag or oryx occurring on very early Ira-nian am uletic objects of about the ninth century, and a remarkably stable but complex design also occurring on ninth-and tenth-century amulets composed of a scorpion, rampant lion or dog, a canopy of stars, and a frame of ~seud~­writing.42 Both designs, for unknown reasons, drop out of the tahsmamc repertoire by the twelfth or thirteenth century, at which time oth~r talis-\\ man~e igns appear to dominate. Of the latter, the most common IS a row \"?e\"ve~ agical symbols, one of which is a five-pointed star (or pentagram) or sometimes hexagram traditionally called the \"Seal of Solomon\".

I INTRODUCTION -------xxv currence on many surviving amulets of undecipherable pseudo-Arabic raises some interesting issues for the historian. Were the words nonsense to the person writing them? Was the person writing them illiterate and misun-derstanding his model? If so, wa, that thought to lessen or invalidate its magical or invocatory power? Did it compromise the efficacy of the magic if the person reciting an invocation or wearing an amulet did not understand the formulae? Talismanic protection was sought for virtually everything. Manuscripts, for example, were often \"protected\" by the simple inscription of the phrase yii kabZkaj (\"0 Buttercup\"). This talismanic inscription did not. involve any magical symbols, but rather reflected the idea that the buttercup, a member of the family of highly poisonous plants called rallullculaceae, was useful in repelling insects and worms. The use of fish-glue and starch-pa,te in Arabic manuscript production attracted to a volume all kinds of worms and insects. It is apparent that, when the actual plant wa, unavailable, it wa, considered equally effective to simply write the name \"buttercup\" (kabZkaj) in an invocation at the front and again at the back of a volume to protect it from insects and worms. In these instances the invocation is neither to God nor to an intercessor nor to a lesser god, but to the occult powers (khawaff) of the plant itself. Magic Squares Magic squares became an important part of the vocabulary of talisman-makers and compilers of magical manuals, particularly after the twelfth cen-tury. The earliest magic square (wafq in Arabic) was a 3 x 3 square having nine cells in which the letter/numerals from 1 through 9 were arranged so that every row and every column a, well a, the two diagonals had the same sum: 15. This ancient magic square (possibly of Chinese origin) was given its own special name of budii(\" derived from the four letter/numerals that are placed in the corner squares (the letters b = 2, d = 4, wlii = 6, and (I = 8). So potent were the magical properties of this square that the name itself, bud\"i', acquired its own occult potency. Thus, like the invocation to a but-tercup (ya kabikaj), when one did not wish or know how to write the magic square, one could invoke it against stomach pains, temporary impotency, or even to become invisible, by writing or saying yii budii(, (\"0 Budii~\").4B The verses on amulets. 48See DWlcan Black Macdonald, uBudul.l\", in E12, Supp!., 153-54."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"I' , xxvi INTRODUCTION ---------~lames of the four archangels were frequently associated with the square, and It was often placed within a larger talismanic design. The magical literature and artefacts that have been studied up till now do not seem to display any knowledge of higher-order magic squares (i.e. larger than 3 x 3) until the thirteenth century. It appears that knowledge of their constructIOn developed before that time but did not pass into the magical vocabulary until the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Mathematical texts from the late tenth century, such as that by Abu I-Wafa' al-Buzjanl (d. 997), contain methods for constructing standard magic squares up to 6 x 6 yet they did not enter the magical vocabulary until about two-hundred year~ later.49 In a magical context there were also squares that on first sight appear to be \"magic squares\", but in fact lack the required mathematical properties. The~e f~ll into tw.o categories: the so-called Latin square (in Arabic, wafq maJazt false magIc square\") and the \"verse square\". In the former each row and each column contain the same set of symbols (be they numerals, letters, words, or abstract marks), but with the order of the symbols differing in each row or column.

' eae 1 consecutive row one word is dropped on the right side and a new one added on the left until the entire selected verse (usually from the Qur'an) is worked into the square. The literature on true magic squares is extensive, for it has attracted the attention of historians of mathematics and puzzles. Yet the focus of vir-tually all the scholarly literature has been upon the mathematical methods of c~'eating magic squares of higher order, rather than upon their magical slgmficance or the\" role in popular culture. For the mathematical historical approaches to the subject, see the publications of Jacques Sesiano.5o See Chapter 6 by Venetia Porter for the magical associations of such squares, . 49B?rdered magic squares of higher orders could also be constructed by rnathemati-Clans III the tenth century.

Magic healing b;)wls were produced in considerable quantity from at least the twelfth century, though they are not found in the written magical literature. In origin they were probably related in some fashion to pre-Islamic Aramaic bowls, though there are in fact great differences in design and function.52 The latter are of clay and have spiral inscriptions invoking demons, while the Islamic ones are of metal and noticeably lacking in any reliance upon jinn and demons. Islamic magic-medicinal bowls are distinct amongst magical artefacts for a number of reasons: a) they were not carried or worn by the sufferer (hence not an amulet); b) they do not function con-tinuously, as a household amulet would; c) they were emplo:teA-\"lll,Lwhen needed'.xe~~hElLwereofa lasting material; and d) the early examples are far more informative as to tllei,rritended use than any other magical artefact, for the early (twelfth-fourteenth century) examples are engraved with state-ments giving specific therapeutic uses. In addition to Qur'anic verses and magical writing, the early bowls were decorated with schematically rendered human and animal forms. A sub-group always have representations of a SCOl'-pion, a snake (or serpent), an animal that is probably intended to be a dog (though some have called it a lion), and two intertwined dragons-imagery reminiscent of the design on ninth/tenth-century Iranian amulets. This sub-group has been designated by some scholars as \"poison cups\", though in fact poisons and animal bites are only some of the many uses inscribed on the outside of the dish.53 !iISee Savage-Smith, \"Talismanic Charts and Shirts\", in Science, Tools fj Magic, I, 106·· 23. 52For the pre-Islamic bowls, see the work of Naveh aJ.\"ld Shaked (above, n. 25). 53See Tewfik Canaan, \"Arabic Magic Bowls\", Jounwl oj the Palesline Oriental Society 16 (1936), 79-127; Savage-Smith, \"Magic-Medicinal Bowls\", in Science, Tools & Magic, I. 72-105."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"[' I xxviii --------------INTRODUCTION -------------------Another type of magical equipment with no counterpart in the literature are magic shirts, made of cloth and painted with magical symbols and verses from the Qur'an.

For these earlier practices, see the analysis by Ann Jeffers.67 The relatively overlooked subject of Armenian divinatory practices has been addressed by Robert Thompson.6s While all but one form of Islamic divination can be traced back to earlier practices, not all the divinatory techniques inherited from early cultures were continued with equal enthusiasm. ~The divinatory practices can be grouped roughly into those whose tech-( niques are largely intuitive and those that employ numerical or mechanical methods. Insights into the future do not always require a procedure or tech-nique, the $ufi association with divination being an example.69 However, the discussion to follow will be restricted to those practices involving spe-cific techniques, beginning with the int!litive forms.

John Lamoreaux has published an excellent study of dream interpretation in early Islam.75 The value of this monograph extends far beyond the limits of the Muslim oneirocritic tradition, and should be read by everyone working on any aspect of divination in early Islam. A number of Byzantine treatises were concerned with divination from winds (brontologia) 01' the philBes of the moon (selenodromia). The predic-tion of seasonal changes and cultivation patterns on the basis of natural phe-nomena such nB thunder, clouds, \"nd rainbows formed part of the Byzantine treatises called 900]1oniclL, transmitted into Islam as the \"Nabatean agricul-ture\" ([(ittlb ai-filii!\", al-nlLblL.t'yaj attributed to Ibn Wal)shTya.76 It could be argued that the most common divinatory practice was that of predicting changing weather patterns. Charles Burnett (Chapter 7) discusses a tract on the topic composed by ai-KindT (d. ca. 870), which was largely dependent upon claBsical and late antique traditions of weather forecasting employing a method based on the visibility of important star-groups.77 Such \" form of divination haB been termed astrometeoroIogy.78 Alexander Fodor has published a study of one example from a group of texts concerned with meteorological divination circuia.ting unde.r t.he title ma.l!wma or malii~im and attributed to the prophet Daniel.79 The example of the genre that Fodor chose to translate and analyse is still in circulation today, at least in Iraq, suggesting that this approach to meteorological foreca.5ting is part of the current folklore. Fodor presents rather ingenious arguments for the date and place of composition-i.e. the beginning of the eleventh century on the southern slope of Tur 'AbdTn, by a Syriac Christian monk. Knowledge of stars, and in particular lunar mansions (a series of 28 prominent star-groups near the ecliptic), formed the basis for much of this astrometeorology. A very important examination of the recognition of star groups in early Islam is that by Joseph Henninger, regrettably overlooked in much of the literature.8~ 75Lamoreaux.

They played a prominent role par-l.icularIy in non-horoscopic forms of astrology. Their use is evident in the Lreatises of the Brethren of Purity (Ikhwan al-$afa') and in the Picatrix, hoth compiled at the end of the tenth century, as well 0.5 in geomancy.81 Daniel Varisco has published a useful study of the astrological significance of lunar mansions as given in a thirteenth-century Yemeni treatise, with a survey of earlier writings on the subject.82 The most intuitive of all forms of divination-physiognomy-will be dis-eussed at the end of this essay. The forms of divination that were less il.ltuitive fall into three groups: sortilege, letter-number interpretation, and \"strology.83 Sortilege The Roman practice of lot-co.5ting or sortilege (the interpretation of results produced by chance) was especially popular throughout late antiquity and continued to be so in the Islamic world. Lot-casting was not always divina-tion in the sense of predicting the futul'e, but rather a means of determining a. course of action or deciding between courses of action. In the Qur'an two practices involving chance were prohibited: istiqsiim, a pre-Islamic use of rods to settle disputes or give simple omens; and maysir, literally, \"the game of the left-handed\", involving arrows and the slaughter-ing of animals and later extended to include all kinds of gambling (qimiir).S4 Nonetheless, the casting of lots (qu1\"'a) was considered legitimate.s5 Dice, Zeitsclu'ijt fijr Ethnologic 79 (1954). 82-117; repro with additions in Joseph Henninger, Ambica Sacra (Gottingell, 1981), 48--117. 81See above, lUl. 22, 33, and, for geomantic use of lunar mansions, Chapter 8. \\--82Daniel M.

The Arabic term for bib-liomancy was usually !\"\"'q al-istikhiiriit (\"the method of choices\"), the term istikhiira meaning entrusting to God the choice between several options.s7 Lot-books in the form of tables of questions and answers were also employed, with selection determined by letters or numbers or verses. A lot-book con-sisting of 144 topics, each topic provided with twelve answers, circulated under the name of aI-KindT (as well as other early figures) and claimed an associ;.tion with the caliph al-Ma'mun.88 ~9comancy.( 'il1Jl:\"I:ra111L_\"~~e science of the sand\") also falls within the category of sortilege, although it does not appear to have been one of those techniques taken from pre-Islamic practices. In this respect it is unique amongst the Islamic divinatory practices. Numerous Arabic and Persian manuscripts on the topic are preserved, but they do not seem to occur together with works on interpretation of dreams nor with physiognomy-suggesting a very different origin and different milieu in which it was prac-ticed. Its origin is a matter of speculation, but it appears to have been a well·\"sl.\" blished practice in Nort.h Africa, Egypt, and Syria by the twelfth century. Its purported history and iL,sociation with the archangel Gabriel, Idrfs, and a legendary Indian sage Tum\\um ai-HindI is related in Chapter 8.89 Ibn Khaldun iL,\"ociated it particularly with urban practices, and said: \"Many city dwellers who had no work, in order to make a living, tried sand divinat.ion\" ,90 It \".pppal·~ t.o Iw thp: only example we have of a divinatory technique for which a mechanical device wa., constructed.\"!

The nillnerical value of a name had particular significance, and if that is the foclls of the technique, then the art is known as onomancy. An onomantic tll])le often present in divinatoi'YTfeatiseswM used-tOdet~~mine the victor lI.nd the vanquished by calculating the numerical value of the names of the ,'\"ntenders, dividing each by nine, and finding the remainders on the chart. The technique wa, usually called !,isiib al-Mm (\"calculation by nine\").93 There were similar procedures for determining the outcome of an illness, the Hllccess of a journey, the truth or falsity of a matter, or whether or not an t'\\'f'nt would occur. More complicated techniques of interpreting numerical values of words or phrases soon developed. The form of letter-number interpretation known as jafr included combining the letters of a divine name (one of the 99 names of! God) with those of the name of the desired object.94 Astrological elements I, of possible Indian origin were also introduced into the art of jafr. The \\ \"authority\" most often a,sociated with ja/r' was Imam Ja'far al-$adiq, who \" dicJ in 765. ' An even more complicated form of letter-number manipulation was called zii'irja.95 It employed concentric circles, letters of the alphabet, elements of astrology, and poetry, while requiring the calculation of the degree of the ecliptic on the easte1'll horizon at the time of forming the intricate circular c\"\",,rt. After various manipulations, a phrase was formed whose meaning was then interpreted. So complicated wa, this method that according to the Ottoman historian J:iajjI KhalTfa: \"It·i~,-sa.i(rthat no' one is capable of' understan'Cfingltsti:ue mea.niilgexcepTtlleMa.rlci(-;,~p~\"Ctedat ·theeiid~or 92See Fahd, ul:itl.Iilf ('ilm-)\", 395-36; MacDonald and Fahd, \"Srmiya''', 612-13. 9SPranz Rosenthal comments all the term ni\"m and the hist.ory of this technique in Ibn Khaldrm, Muqaddima, I, 23511.359. 94Fahd, \"Djafr\", 375-77, 95See Toufic Fahd and Anne Regourd, \"Za'irdja\", 404-405."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I'\" xxxvi INTRODUCTION ---------time.\"96 The \"histOl\"Y\" of zii'irja, like geomancy (see Chapter 8), was asso-ciated with the legendary Tumtum aI-HindI, and while it Was mentioned by early writers, such as the astrologer Abu Ma'shar, it was not fully developed until the late thirteenth century. The diagram and technique used in zii'irja also greatly influenced $UfiSlll. The extant treatises on jafr and zii'irja are voluminous, yet none have been translated and studied in their entirety. One of the most useful intro-ductions is the chapter on zii'iTja in Ibn Khaldun's Muqadimmah.97 Number symbolism also infiltrated the general culture of the population, resulting in the quantities and measurements given by medieval authors being often de-termined by a number's magical significance.98 AstTology Horoscopic astrology, as well as simpler forms of zodiacal associations, were practiced throughout late antiquity and continued in the Islamic period, while the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy's defence of astrology in his Tetrabiblos, written in the second century AD and later translated into Ara-bic, was crucial in establishing astrology as the most important learned form of divination. There were, however, many other pre-Islamic influences on the development of the art in the early Islamic world.99 The Sabian inhabitants of l:Iarran in northern Iraq were particularly famous for the practice of astrol-ogy, and theil' influence extended well into the early Islamic period-a topic addressed in po.rt. hy Francis Peters in Chapter 2. The influence of Hermetic literature from late antiquity is also evident.'OO In a divinatory text, The Book of the Zodiac, preserved in the Mandaic language of lower central Iraq, one sees the blending of Babylonian, Sasanian, and Hellenistic traditions in a popular form of astrological divination that also employed onomancy and omens drawn from natural phenomena.

INTRODUCTION xxxvii I,,,chniqlles can be seen in many of the Arabic astrological treatises preserved today. Astrology ('ilm al-nujllm, \"the science of the stars\") was understood and practiced at several levels. Non-horoscopic astrology {what Toutic Fahd has termed \"natural astrology\")'01 did not require a knowledge of mathematics Md was a much simpler technique that I have placed amongst the intuitive forms of divination. It involved the prediction of events based upon the rising or setting of certain star groups (usually lunar mansions) or geophysical events such as earthquakes or winds. Astrology that involved calculatingl the positions of planets and the mathematical production of horoscopes is. often called judicial astrology ('ilm a!,kiim al-nujum, \"the science of the judgments of the stars\") or sometimes catarchic astrology. This form of astrology in turn brea.ks up into four categories: 1. 2. 3. 4. The determination of the fate of an individual based on nativities (mawiilid in Arabic), that is, a horoscope representing the planets at time of birth. Historians have given this branch of astrology the awkward name of genethlialogy . The production of horoscopes for determining the course of events for a country or dynasty or even longer periods of time. The determination of auspicious and inauspicious days and whether action should or should not be taken, based upon a horoscope drawn up for the day in question. In Arabic this method was referred to as ikhtiyariit {\"choices,,).102 There were also other means of determining auspicious and inauspicious days ba,<)cd on calendrical considerations, to which the term hemerology is often applied. The construction of horoscopes with the intent of answering specific questions (lnasa,'il). The questions could concern innermost thoughts {(lam'T), or the location of lost objects, or the diagnosis and prognosis of disease or numerous others concerns. Sometimes entire treatises -, were composed just on finding lost objects by astrological methods or on astrological me.dicine. This form of astrology, usually termed Interrogations, is sometimes combined with the previous type when classifying astrological practicesl03 101Toufic Fahd, \"NudjulU ('ilm al-)\", in £1'2, VIII, 105-108, l02See David Pingree, \"E~tUiratn, 291-92. 103 As, for example, George Saliba has done in Chapter 10 (pp, 58-60), where he enumer-ates yet more subdivisions of astrology."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xxxviii ---------INTRODUCTION ---------In the past twenty years a number of important editions and translations of early texts have appeared.

Astrological associations also had a major impact upon artistic conven-tions. The important study by Willy Hartner demonstrates the influence of the \"lunar nodes\" on Islamic artisans.ll5 The two points where the course of the moon crosses the ecliptic (and hence associated with eclipses) were tradi-tionally known as the \"head of the dragon\" ( .. ,cending node) and the \"tail of the dragon\" (descending node). This non-Ptolemaic concept played a promi-nent role in astrological associations, with the nodes even serving as extra \"planets\" in the formation of astrological horoscopes. The representation of the constellation Sagittarius with a dragon-heacled tail is, according to Hart-ner, often to be interpreted .. , an iconographic reference to the descending 11lKushyar ibn Labban, Introduction to Asll'Ology, ed. anu trans.

One of the most famous and richly decorated Arabic astrological treatises is the I<itab al·bulhan, apparently produced at the end of the fourteenth century. Stefano Carboni published a preliminary examination of the imagery in this remarkable compiJation.na Much still needs to be done, however, in tracing the earlier influences on the imagery and the techniques incorporated into this non-horoscopic astrological and divinatory treatise that claims the authority of Abu Ma'shar. Of the numerous practices attempting to foretell future events or discern hidden things, astrology was by far the most popular. George Saliba, in his essay on the role of the \".5trologer (Chapter 10), amply demonstrates the widespread popular acceptance of astrology. He also presents evidence re-garding the symbols that came to represent astrologers (and fortune-tellers in geneml), the training of astrologers, their status in society, and the con-ditions in whic.h they worked. All the non-intuitive tec.hniques-sortilege, letter-number interpretation, astrology-were em ployed to answer more or less the same questions: the rflature and course of an illness, the outcome of a journey, the fate of an I absent perSOll, the prospect of improved reSOlIl'CeS, and so forth.

Their intent is \"\"I, to determine ~ hidden character by aligning physical characteristics with .,J\",mder traits, but rather to read the future from a bodily part. For exam-ple, the success or failure of an enterprise might be indicated by a twitching \"ydid or a certain line on the palm. . On the other hand, the major impetus of physiognomy (firasa) was to dewde the inner character by developing a grammar of observable bodily fm,tures. It was not concerned with predicting future events, except in terms of the effect one's character has on future behaviour. In contrast to other forms of prognostication where a consultation with a specialist is necessary, it. appears from the literature that anyone could use physical features as a guide to inner character after reading a treatise on physiognomy. The term firasa came from the vocabulary of ~ufism, where it designated Ii type of mystical intuition and form of wisdom. It was employed already in the ninth century as a translation of the Greek word physiognomonika when l:lunayn ibn Isl.laq translated a small ireatise on the subject incor~ectly as-cribed to Aristotle.ln Since its inception in Greek and Roman literature, physiognomy was not just a taxonomy of human expressions or the codi-fying of bodily features, but it was a means of c1a.ssifying people so as ~o gain knowledge of their internal ideas and motives. It played a major role III the rhetoric of the day, and its principles were applied also to the practical problems of medical diagnosis and prognosis, how one could choose a good physician, or who would be a reliable and honest servant. In physiognomy (through its use of external physical clues), one passed directly from knowl-edge of the known to the unknown, and for this rea.son it wa.s incorporated into many general divinatory manuals. A chapter on the topic of firasa forms part of the \"Secret of Secrets\" (Sirr at-asrar).\"3 The latter was an immensely influential treatise intended as a 121Here I differ wit.h Fahd, who considers these practices a part of physiognomy; see Toufic Fahd, \"Firasa\", in E12, II, 916-17; idem, Divinotion arabe, 369-429. 122 Anlonella Ghersetti, II J(itab Arista!alls ai-/ayiasfij If l-firasa nella traduzione di Ifunayn b.

No Greek original of the SilT al-asrar exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into Syriac and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known ninth-century translator, Yallya ibn al-Bi~riq. It is likely that the treatise gradually evolved over a long period through the accretion of material on a wide range of topics, including statecraft, ethics, physiognomy, astrology, alchemy, magic, and medicine. In the early tenth century we find physiognomy forming a small chapter. in a medical compendium by Mul.lammad ibn Zakariya' al-Razi (d. 925).'24 This chapter is distinctive in terms of the physiognomic literature in having the order of the parts of the body given from top to bottom, starting with the hair and then proceeding to the colour of the face and eyes and ending with the feet-an order of presentation common in medical manuals. Indeed, several Hippocratic writings were influential in later physiognomic thought, since they employed physiognomic indicators. The Hippocratic tract on prognosis and signs of death used physical characteristics as guides (e.g. if the nose became sharp and the eyes sunken, and if the fingernails were a greenish colour, then de<Lth may be expected). In the Hippocratic treatise Airs, Watel's, Places, the physical characteristics of people or races living at different locations were described, and it was said, for example, that people living near stagnant water in marshes and lakes have large and firm spleens with hard bellies and tend to have dropsy with a fever (characteristics that today we consider ,ymptoillatic of malaria). Thus the boundaries between medical and physiognomic literature are blurred. Most astrological manuals had chapters aligning the twelve zodiacal signs and the seven planets with particular physical conformations and with cer-tain character traits and professions. The geomantic manuals are also con-spicuous in their use of physiognomic material and alignments. In the thir-teenth century there were a number of Arabic monographs devoted solely to physiognomy. If the number of preserved copies is an accurate indica-tion, the most popular treatise on physiognomy was that by Shams ai-Din shortly after it was acquired by the British Library (in the British Museum Quarterly 20 [1955}, 33-34), it has only recently been shown to be a forgery produced about 1940 by a well·known studio in Iran. 124This chapter, part of I<itiib al-Man~iirf, has been published in I<itiib aJ-Jiriisa Ii.

' INTRODUCTION xliii n.I-Dilllashqi (d. 1327), an imam in Rabwa, Syria, best known for his COSIllO-III~i<:al writings. 'I'h\"-ro is an on-going project, headed by Simon Swain, to survey the early (: \"!)uk and Islamic written treatises on physiognomy. Following the comple-tion of this project, scholars might then formulate and address a number of q,wstions regarding the interaction of this type of literature, in all its various fOl'llls, with other aspects of Islamic culture. For example, the relationship he tween the physiognomic literature and medical discourses, or the role of physiognomy in guides to purchasing slaves, and the role played by phys-iognomy in rhetorical literature. What role did firasa play in portraiture \"lid figural drawing? What role did it have in the reception and interpre-t:ttion of figural painting by the observer? Did the ethical ideals, and the external manifestations associated with these ideals, remain unchanged in the Arabic (and Persian or Turkish) traditions? If the physical descriptions in such treatises remained constant over centuries and large geographical areas, then their direct influence on changing conventions of portra.iture is problematic. On the other hand, if they were changing, were they doing so in a. wa.y consistent with the artistic conventions of a given location and Lime? Did ji1'ii::ia reilccl a. ::iociety's HoLiOll or an iJcal mau, or did it help form the notion? Or did it clo neither; was it only a literary and rhetorical tradition? Did firiisa playa role in the mimicry of stock characters employed in storytelling? For example, is there a demonstrable relationship between the physical characteristics of certain personality types in the \"Secret of Se-crets\" (or in al-Dimashqi's physiognomy) and Abu Zayd and other figures in Ijarlri's Maqamiit written in the eleventh to twelfth century, or characters in the Thousand and One Nights'! Do we have the name of a single practi-tioner of physiognomy ill the Islamic lands? Are we justified in asserting that the physiognomic writings had any influence outside the literary, fictional, medical, or divinatory environment in which it was created? Though physiognomy is perhaps the most conspicuous example of a div-inatory method forming part of a large spectrum of genres, the same broad approach should be applied to all the divinatory and magical material. There are broader questions to be a.sked once more texts and artefacts are care-fully analysed and published-a task made the more difficult because the lines separating the different forms of divination, as well as magic, were very fluid, and techniques were often combined. The indebtedness to pre-Islamic concepts and practices is certainly an important aspect of the study. Equally important, however, are the subtle changes and adaptations to Is-lamic culture and beliefs, the differences in procedures advocated by various"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"IIlf . I I I I ,I I' i xliv INTRODUCTION ---------au thaI's, and the changing relationship of magical and divinatory material with other genres and practices. Systematic comparison of treatises needs to be undertaken. Were some of the magical and divinatory treatises merely literary and rhetorical traditions, not reflected in actual practice? Did some ' practices arise that were not incorporated into the written traditions? How are discrepancies between treatises and artefacts to be resolved? What was the relationship between the formal literature and the makers of artefacts and the practitioners of the art? Wha.t was the intended readership for the magical and divinatory treatises? To what extent did the ideas expressed in the magicaljdivinatory literature invade or reflect the realms of poetry, history, biography, and storytelling? Fortunately, through the work of Sezgin, Ullmann, Fahd, and many oth-ers, the groundwork has been laid for further investigation. It is evident that magic and divination in the classical Islamic world is now attracting the se-rious consideration of historians. Yet much work remains to be done. No full survey of all the Arabic literature has been published, not even a listing of the preserved manuscript sources, a.nd the Persian and Turkish sources are for the most part overlooked by historians. More written sources need to be studied and compared in detail, with more artefacts examined. Consid-eration needs to be given to the inter-relationship of magic_anddivl!!a~ion with. other icleilS and prac!lces~ The work of the scholars reprinted in this vOlume and liste~lin th;-bibliography can provide a b .. sis for tackling the rather daunting task of understanding the role of magic and divination, in all its manifestations, in the ea.r1y Islamic world. , I I i I t ,,; , BIBLIOGRAPHY (Io\"eral Bibliographic Sources Flthd, Toufic.

It is understandable that when schol-ars undertook to collect all instances of belief.s in spirits,' they searched not only in the Old Testament and its oriental surroundings, but also among the Arabs; this was because it was assumed that the Arabs-especially the Arab bedouins-were still closest to the original Semitic culture and religion.' It was also on this basis that the development of Semitic religion from polyde-monism through polytheism to monotheism was to be reconstructed. A variant of this theory linked these beliefs in spirits to totemism. William Robertson Smith argued that Arabian natural spirits (jinn) are collective and anonymous rather than individual; they form clans that act in solidarity; and finally, they prefer to appear in animal form.

Most supporters of the animist theory, however, did not accept this view,S 'lild the arguments adduced by [281] Smith are not conclusive, as has been ohown elsewhere,6 and consequently will not be taken into consideration in the following. Wellhausen formulated the theory of the development of the Semitic religion mentioned above in the following classic words: ... the gods are of a kind with the demons, and where they are linked to a particular locale on earth, they have grown from demons, from the spirits of a place, a tree, a spring, a ser-pent .... Demons live only in a holy place; people refrain from disturbing them but do not worship them. As soon as they are approached and worshipped there, they undergo the transition to being gods .... At tha.t point they emerge from the shadow of t.heir kind and becollle individual:; .... As patrons or indeed a.n-cestors they assume a position at the head of a closed group in society .... In the same measure that their relationship with humans within a context of worship develops, their relation-ship with the elements recedes .... After cult-gods that are wor-\"hipped have thus freed themselves from the elements that orig-inally linked their worship to a particular place, there is nothing to prevent them from being associated with heavenly phenom-ena .... Polytheism results of necessity from the ethnicity of the religious cult, from the separate relationship of the deity with the Arab community .... Syncret.ism, which is usually considered to be the original polytheism, is'in truth a dissolved polytheism, at any rate a dissolved ethnic particularism of religion on which the syncretism is founded. Still, it is a step forward, for it is the 4 William Robertson Smith, Leclw'es on the Religion of the Semites (London, 1889; 3rd ed., with an Introduction and Additional Notes by Stanley A. Cook,.

It is notewor-thy that the Arabs never say \"the gods\" in the sense of Greek hoi theoi or Latin dii. They did not put the whole collection of individual gods into a plural, but rather raised the singular nomen generis, the idea, to be the hypostasis. This would argue in favour of a monotheistic instinct among the Semites, if it were not for the Hebrew Elohim and the pluralis majestaticus, which clearly prove otherwise .... 7 While these observations (quoted in much abbreviated form here) do contain much that is disputable,S they are undoubtedly most brilliant. By compari-son, the views contained in some modern works are often meagre and far too simplistic, as for example in Adolf IGselau, who simply explains the belief in spirits and magical beliefs a.s being the primitive religion of the bedouins and traces their emergence back to their environment.9 • Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes (in, 1957, i.e. 70 years after the first edition of Wellhausen's work) adds hardly anything new, compared to the latter, when he writes: Step by step, the jinn were replaced in the eyes of their worship-pers by more distinct deities .... Thus we seem to see the jinn at the lower end of the chain, at the higher end some deities endowed with a distinct and powerful personality, and between them the vague gods who are the arbiib (masters) of certain tribes, the jinn who have not succeeded in becoming truly gods. They are all [282] worshipped in rites that are only distinguished from one another by their greater or lesser complexity and the number of believers. The change from jinn to great god takes place imperceptibly with the flow of circumstances. Thus the passage from idolatry to monotheism is prepared by the regard for the jinn together with the old ritual forms ... 10 7Wellhausen, Reste arabischen Heidentums, 211-24 (the quoted passages: 212, 213, 214, ~:5, 2~7~ 219; th.e emphasis is Wellhausen's). George Aaron Barton (Semitic and H~nut~c Ongms: Socwl and Religious (Philadelphia, 1934J, 120-21) also derives every-thing, In accordance with Tylor, from animism. 8Concerning criticism see, for the time being, Marie-Joseph Lagrange, Etudes sur les religions semitiques, 2nd ed.

De I'animisme n I'universalisme (the subtitle is significant), which appeared in 1958, to pl·ove parallels between social and religious developments, despite a most mechanical presentation of the course of history,l1 The view that the belief in spirits by the bedouin Arabs wa.s the origin ror the whole of their religious development has been endorsed by several !llOdern authors. The latter usually draw more or less extensively on the literature on contemporary popular or folk religion, research that has grown significantly over recent decades, as well as on the accounts of pre-Islamic Arabia. Consequently, if we wish to attain a critical appreciation of this theory of development, both of these fields have to be taken into considera-Lion. We will not, however, take any account of the Arabic-speaking popula-tion of modern Egypt and North Africa. These peoples are not originally S~mitic and only became AT'abicized as a consequence of the Muslim con-'Illest of tho area.. Delif'fs in spirits among them frequently present thcm-~elves as a very complicated mixture of indigenous ancient Egyptian and Libyan-Berber and ancient Arabian-Islamic elementsP Added to this are recent influences from Black Africa, which have entered as a consequence of the slave trade.

The following presentation takes into account the Arabian peninsula only, including its border areas in Palestine, Syria and Iraq, some of which were already Arabicized in pre-Islamic times. [283J Where belief in spirits is discussed within this context, the sub-ject will be only natural spirits, not the ghosts of dead persons. If both these concepts were studied, we would also have to include the complex problem of the pre-Islamic Arabs' idea of the soul and their views on life after death, which, within the framework of the present article, would leadt too far.

An individual is called jinn!, fern. jinnfya; jann is found synonymous to jinn, occasionally denoting au individual (D.B. Macdonald, art. UDjinn'1 in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1st ed., I [1913], 1091b, refers to E.W. Lane's didio-nary, 492c, which should rend 462c). For furt.hel' information about the origin and original meaning of the word, see nn. 225-12 below.

See Canaan, \"Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palestine\", 36-37, on \"inhabit.ed\" trees; ibid., 45-46, on uinhabited\" caves. Springs are usually inhabited by spirits, only very rarely by saints or even sacred to them; see Canaan, \"Haunted Springs and Water Demons in Palestine\", 158-59, 167-68. In contrast to Curtiss, Canaan also states clearly that he never heard of a spring whose inhabitant is sometimes a wall and sometimes a jinnl, and that he assumes that in these cases there must be two different inhabitants (\"Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palest.ine\", 66). Some springs are inhabited by two spirits, one good and one evil (ibid., 37,66-67; see also Canaan, Diimonenglaube, 2). Jaussen (Moab, 295, 319) also distinguishes clearly between the ghost of a dead person and a jinn!.

Humans are surrounded by them at every step they take and must always be on their guard against them.70 The beliefs of the bedouins do not go quite so far. According to the Rwala, the possible dwelling-places of the spirits are much more restricted. They are sedentary (!w¢ar), and live on high mountains in inaccessible chasms and old ruins. Unlike the bedouins themselves, they never possess tents. Their hiding places are beneath the earth, in crevices, in caves and in the vaults of deserted buildings. The further away such a crevice or ruin is from a water-hole, the better the jinn like it because they know they will not be disturbed therein.7!

We find that the bedouins in northeastern Arabia (Kuwait and neighbouring countries) also mention par-ticular places where jinn are likely to live; in one case a meteorite crater is such a place, in another a spring rich in sulphur and therefore stinking (Dickson, The Arab of the Deser·t, 538-39).

Ac-counts of the fuqw'ii' in the northern I:lijaz state on the one hand that they believe spirits to dwell in particular places, such as old graves (Jaussen and Savignac, \"Coutumes\", 61), on the other hand that the spirits are \"everywhere\" (ibid., 62). 15"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"If!

They also like to dwell in caves,76 wells and ponds77-unlike the views of the Rwala in the case of the latter.

On the subject in general see also Thomas, \"Anthropological Observations in South Arabia\", J01lrfwl of the Royal Afltliropological Institute 62 (1932), 88~90; furthermore, from the older literature, especially the information by Wrede that Zbinden did not evalua.te: spirits live in certain valleys and rock chasms (Wrede, Reise, 83, 117), in mins (153, 195), in a grotto (125-26), in a river (179-80), in a mimosa hUl'lh (131), in the \"sea of sands\" (242, 244, 246-47), A valley that is a playground for evil spirits remains uninhab.ited despite its rich vegetation (8.3). The spirits are guarding t.reasures (126, 195, 242, 246-47). There is a serpent wearing a diamond on its head; it. takes the diamond off while drinking and if a human can seize this diamond, he will have power over the spirits; Solomon was such a one (266). Wrede himself had the reputation of being a tamer of spirits and treasure hunter (126, 195, 213, 242, 246-47) and people believed there was a demon imprisoned in his pocket watch. Another traveller, who had travelled through the same regions approximately ten years earlier, had the same reputation and was murdered (232). Wrede does not give us any information on the worship of jinn; he mentions only that the bedouins, when they entered a cave, addressed themselves to the jinn, calling loudly asking permission (125). In his Reise nach Siidarabien (Braunschweig, 1873), 304, Heinrich FreiheIT von Maltzan also mentions a warm spring inhabited by a spirit. Cf. Smith, Religion, 168 n. 3. Concerning mountain spirits in Oman see n. 102 below. 82The accounts by Thomas (see n. 81 above) refer to the border areas. Dickson (The Arab of the Desert, 286-87) has some information about the belief in jinn among the Murra in the great South Arabian desert. These people are said to attribute the phenomenon of the \"singing sands\" and other noises in the desert to the spirits. H.St.J.

Beliefs in spirits among the semi~bedollin peoples show more similarities with those found among the sedentary peoples in Palestine and Syria84 (see below, 294-96, on the subject of sacrifices). The activities of spirits can be observed in nature: mirages, whirlwinds, sand-spouts, mists, etc. are attributed to them85 Above all, [292] how-ever, they play tricks on humans, sometimes harrnless, sometimes maHcious ones, in which way they frighten humans (and animals)86 We have already mentioned (above, n. 32) sexual relations between humans and jinn (which frequently end badly for the human partner), as well as female spirits who appear to men in alluring guises and then lead the men to their ruin (above, 11.48). Dreams are also, at least p<Lrt.ly, attributed to the influence of spir-its.87 If a jinni is provoked by a human-and humans can provoke jinn even unwittingly-the jinn?: wi!! \"strike\" him (some jir;n even attack with-out provocation, as in the case of the evil female spil~'its mentioned in nn. 51-.53 above)) and the consequence is disease) sometimes even immediate death.

Will-o'-the-wisps are also attributed to jinn (Zbinden, Die Djinn des Is/am, 52). The idea that sand spouts (trombes de poussiere) are caused by jinn is also found among city-dwellers in ~an!a'; see Claudie Fayein, Urle Francaise Medecin au Yemen (Paris, 1955),85. The explanation of the \"singing sands\", which is not restricted to Southern Arabia, also belongs here (see n. 82 above). Richard F. Burton reports from ancient Midian (the border country between Arabia Petraea and the northern J:Iijaz.) that a \"sand pyramid\" resounds with music when the caravan of Mecca pilgrims passes it and that tlus is the reason why sacrifices are offered here; The Land of Midian Revisited (London, 1879), I, 65-66. We can assume that once again the music is ascribed to jinn in this case. 86Musil, Arabia Petraea, III, 320, 323; Jaussen, Moab, 319-20; Jaussen and Savignac, \"Coutumes\", 61; Canaan, Diimonenglaube, 19-21, 37-38; Zbinden, Die Djinn des Islam, 35,37,40-41,47,52. 87Canaan, Diimonenglaube, 21, 41; Hess, VOrl den Beduinen des inne1'en Ambiens, 159.
