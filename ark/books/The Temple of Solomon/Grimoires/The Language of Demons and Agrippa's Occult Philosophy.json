In twoletters to his friends, in which he discussed the progress of his great treatiseon magic De occulta philosophia libri tres1 [Three Books of OccultPhilosophy, hereafter DOP ], Agrippa wrote of a “secret key” to the occultphilosophy, a key which would be revealed only to his closest friends.2 Inthe latter half of the sixteenth century, it was commonly believed that this“key” referred to a text of black magic spuriously attributed to Agrippa,3thus lending credence to the legends of Agrippa the black magician, whichin turn led to Agrippa’s importance as a source for the Faust legends. Butif the Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy was certainly a spurious work, whatwas Agrippa’s secret key to the occult philosophy?Agrippa, one of the most influential magical thinkers of the Renais-sance, was for the next two centuries continually cited (positively ornegatively) along with Paracelsus as a founding thinker of the magical"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE24Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (Chicago: University ofChicago Press, 1964), 130.5Frances Yates, “Renaissance Philosophers in Elizabethan England: John Dee andGiordano Bruno,” in Lull & Bruno: Collected Essays, volume 1 (London: Routledge andKegan Paul, 1982), 221.schools of thought. Despite this, modern scholars have had great difficultyuncovering anything of value or importance in his greatest work, DOP.After a lifetime of work on Giordano Bruno and John Dee, DameFrances Yates finally settled on Agrippa as the touchstone, if not the key,to the mysteries of Renaissance magic. In an earlier work, she hadapologized for devoting a chapter to Agrippa despite the fact that DOP“does not fully give the technical procedures, nor is it a profoundphilosophical work, as its title implies. . . .”4 In one of her last publishedarticles, however, she commented:The extraordinary strength of the influence of Agrippa’s De occultaphilosophia has not yet been fully realized. It was an influence whichoperated in diverse ways with differing results. It encouraged Dee’sCabalistical angel-conjuring. It encouraged Bruno’s magical mnemonics.It was central not only to the spread of Renaissance magic but also to thereaction against it.5This apparent change of heart conceals a crucial point in modernassessments of Agrippa: while it is undeniable that he was influential,modern scholarship has been unable to explain why he was influential.The onus of the present analysis of DOP is to give an explanation for thisimportance by demonstrating the philosophical complexity and interest ofa great magician’s work. Thus this is a search for Agrippa’s “secret key” inthe text of DOP itself.Theory and MethodWhile Agrippa is most directly relevant for scholars of Renaissanceintellectual history and history of science, this work is not directed solelyto such scholars. Indeed, I want to show that the methods and ideas ofother disciplines can contribute to the analysis of Renaissance magic.

I subdivide theminto three groups: history of religions, history of ideas, and textualcriticism.Anthropology and History of ReligionsOn the face of it, it seems as though a necessary preliminary to an analysisof Renaissance magical texts would be a definition of magic. Unfortu-nately, the question of such a definition has a long and troubled historyand now seems more or less moribund. Like many cemetery residents,however, it is “not dead, only sleeping,” and haunts many facets ofcontemporary discussion in the history of religions and anthropology. Inwhat follows, I summarize these arguments about definitions, thenpropose a way of reopening the question more profitably.The classic description of the problem was Malinowski’s phrase,“magic, science, and religion” in the eponymous essay.6 How does magicrelate to these other modes of belief, thought, and behavior? Morebroadly, what is magic? We can break down the answers into threecategories, which I term proto-science, illicit religion, and social cleavage.The notion that magic and witchcraft have some relationship withrationality or science was perhaps most famously formulated by Sir JamesFrazer in The Golden Bough: “In short, magic is a spurious system ofnatural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct; it is a false science aswell as an abortive art.”7 After discussing the “laws” which underlie themagician’s “logic,” Frazer tells us that these are ultimately based upon the“principles of association”; in ringing prose, he argues that these principles"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE48Frazer, Golden Bough, 57.9“Homeopathic” magic has generally come to be called “sympathetic magic” in laterdiscussions, although for Frazer “sympathy” is the general principle upon which all magicis based.10Frazer, Golden Bough, 53.11Frazer, Golden Bough, 13.12Frazer, Golden Bough, 53.are excellent in themselves, and indeed absolutely essential to the workingof the human mind. Legitimately applied they yield science; illegitimatelyapplied they yield magic, the bastard sister of science.8Despite this negative comparison, it should not be thought that Frazer hadnothing positive to say about magic. By defining magic in terms of suchlaws as “contagion” and “homeopathy,”9 by discussing magicians as “menof the keenest intelligence and the most unscrupulous character” who inspite and because of their deceptions have often “been most beneficent intheir use of [their power],”10 he brought to the fore several issues whichwould haunt scholars for the next century:(1) Is there not a certain rationality, however defined, or application ofrational principles, which inheres in magical practices?(2) Does magic have some historical or analogical relation to modernscience? Does it have such a relation to religion?(3) What status can we attribute to the claims of magicians; in otherwords, is a magician, in general, a “sorcerer who sincerely believes in hisown extravagant pretensions” or a “deliberate impostor”?Frazer’s own opinions on these issues are easily catalogued and, in themain, set aside. First, while there is certainly a “rationality” to thesepractices, “the primitive magician knows magic only on its practical side;he never analyses the mental processes on which his practice is based, neverreflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions.”11 Howeverrational the principles dredged up by the “philosophic student” to explainthese practices, the practitioner cannot be said to be a “scientist,” i.e. arational, careful thinker. On the second question, Frazer argues thefamous evolutionary theory (similar to that of E.B. Tylor), that magicleads to religion, which in turn leads to science. Finally, he arguesforcefully that the successful magician is a deliberate fraud, although “if wecould balance the harm they do by their knavery against the benefits theyconfer by their superior sagacity, it might well be found that the goodgreatly outweighed the evil,”12 in other words the fact that a magician is a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION513Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, trans.

On its side,religion, when it has not condemned and prohibited magic rites, has alwayslooked upon them with disfavor.13Similarly,A magical rite is any rite which does not play a part in organized cults—itis private, secret, mysterious and approaches the limits of a prohibited rite.14Thus magic is construed as a social behavior, albeit one whose characteris often anti-social. For Mauss, “sympathetic formulas [à la Frazer] . . .will not be sufficient to represent the totality of a rite of sympatheticmagic. The remaining elements are not negligible.”15The notion of magic as illicit religion has considerably more validitythan is (now) generally accepted. So-called magical rituals or practices arecommonly denounced by religious authorities, and it is thus difficult toavoid the charge that by accepting emic definitions of magic arising fromsuch denunciations, we implicitly give credence to the illicit religiontheory. At the same time, practices apparently extremely similar arevalorized by the same authorities as valid modes of religious practice andexperience, sometimes even as licit defenses against magic. Luther’sdenunciation of the doctrine of transubstantiation is in some waysrelatively typical: by arguing that the Catholic notion of the mass was“magical” he formulated a powerful assault.Although Luther’s attack on the “magical” practices of Catholicismtends to uphold magic as illicit religion, not all practices conventionallylabeled magical fit such a description.

In fact, Evans-Pritchard originally used this distinction only betweenforms of harmful magic, but that element of precision was eventually blurred away.17Evans-Pritchard, Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic, 21 (emphasis mine).18Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (London: Routledge, 1966; ARK, 1984), 103.practitioners such as witches cannot easily be categorized in this fashion.By shifting the focus of analysis from the practice to its social context,however, Durkheim and Mauss made the first step towards a theory ofmagic as primarily an artifact of social interactions.The problematic relationship between “magic” and “religion”eventually led to the invention of what has become the standard anthropo-logical approach to magical behaviors, inaugurated primarily by E.E.Evans-Pritchard in his discussions of the Zande. Evans-Pritchard foundan internal distinction between two different types of magic, which hedesignated “witchcraft” (mangu) and “sorcery” (ngwa).16 This wassomething new—a distinction within magic, rather than an exterior onesuch as homeopathic/contagious. The most important point about thisdistinction for all later discussions of magic is that sorcery is a technique,something acquired or learned, whereas witchcraft is inherent in the witch:Azande believe that some people are witches and can injure them in virtueof an inherent quality. A witch performs no rite, utters no spell andpossesses no medicines. An act of witchcraft is a psychic act.17As Mary Douglas put it, Azande witches were thought to be dangerous without knowing it; theirwitchcraft was made active simply by feelings of resentment or grudge. Theaccusation attempted to regulate the situation by vindicating one andcondemning the other rival.18Douglas (and also Victor Turner) correctly points to the accusation as theessential issue in Evans-Pritchard’s witchcraft definition: since witches donot necessarily know that they are such, acts of witchcraft are oftenunwitting. Thus in a consideration of witchcraft, the only evidence that ithas occurred is that an accusation is made and sustained (usually byoracle).Before moving on to consider the line of debate which followed, I wantto note that all this applies only to Evans-Pritchard’s notion of witchcraft;it has essentially no bearing whatever on what he called sorcery (ngwa), a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION719E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion (Oxford: Clarendon, 1965), 120.20Particularly the excellent works of Carlo Ginzburg and those influenced by him.21Consider, for example, the argument which raged around Chadwick Hansen’s bookon Salem, which suggested that some of those involved actually practiced magic.Witchcraft at Salem (New York: George Braziller, 1969).22Jonathan Z. Smith, “Trading Places,” in Marvin Meyer and Paul Mirecki, eds.,Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1995), 13-27.point often forgotten. For him, the idea of figuring out the underlyingrationality of an overt magical act is an application of what he called the“if I were a horse” mentality, of naively imagining oneself in the magician’sshoes, which mentality he ascribed to Tylor, Frazer, and Malinowski.Instead, Evans-Pritchard focused on effects, believing that “for the socialanthropologist, religion is what religion does.”19 Given this presupposi-tion, he simply focused on accusations and hence on witchcraft, ratherthan on the odd practitioner of sorcery per se (except as a specialist inhealing or fending off witchcraft).Since Evans-Pritchard’s book on the Zande, the majority of analyseshave concentrated on this social role of magic (meaning witchcraft), andthus examine the circumstances of accusations rather than the content ofputative magical actions. For the scholar, this simplifies the issueconsiderably. One need not consider the details of magical acts, examinethe exact content of accusations, or most of all ask why someone wouldattempt magical acts against someone else. This is particularly convenient(and this is a euphemism) when discussing the European witch craze,because it enables the scholar to attack the authorities who sanctioned thewitch-burnings without questioning whether they might have had, insome instances, a legitimate case. In other words, the question of whetheran accused witch might have actually performed magical acts becomesirrelevant, and the authorities who condemn the witch can be denouncedfor their oppressive behavior. But however much we deplore thepunishment, it is theoretically possible that at least a few condemnedwitches might have been guilty as charged. While recent studies of the witch-craze take seriously the content of theaccusations,20 very few consider the possibility that some witches mightactually have practiced magic,21 nor have they shown much interest inperformed magical acts. Instead, the focus is on a content-less “witch-craft,” where no act is involved—only an accusation. This approach hascertain problematic ramifications, of which Jonathan Z. Smith22 lists five:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE823I would add that this analytical approach tends to effect disempowerment, by treatingthe accused as though they had no social agency.(1) It is extremely rare that the “necessary” sociological data areavailable, especially when dealing with the past rather than modernethnographies;(2) One tends to assume that the magician is disempowered in somemanner, and thus the accusation sustained because the powerful accuse thepowerless, as in the witch craze;23(3) This focus ignores the possibility that someone might actuallypractice magic;(4) The scholar cannot explain or analyze professional magicians ortheir beliefs and practices; and(5) We are unable to get beyond the native usage of the term “magic”and produce an effective second-order explanatory terminology, becausethere is essentially no data for magic.While the “social cleavage” theory of magic is very effective forunderstanding certain types of data, it seems that many forms of magic falloutside the scope of this theory, particularly those which involve docu-mented magical practices.If we wish to analyze magical practices rather than accusations, we areforced to return to the problem of rationality and focus on the internal(symbolic) structure of the magical act. The issue is traditionally whetherthis structure is “rational” or “coherent,” and generally focuses on theproblem of falsification: if a magical act is supposed to produce someeffect, and if, so far as the outside observer can discern, the act has nomechanism by which to do so causally, why does magic not die out? Howcan intelligent people continue to believe that their magic will have effectswhen this claim is so clearly falsifiable?Frazer’s answer was that the magician has a whole host of prefabricatedexcuses—counter-magic, slight errors in casting—but then Frazer assumedthat the magician is more or less a clever fraud. For him, magic does notdie out because magicians deceive people into perpetuating it.Malinowski’s response is not much more satisfactory. His mimeticexplanation of magic argues that the magician imitates the effect he wantsto cause. Because the magician becomes subjectively and emotionallyinvolved in his actions by “acting the part,” the action produces apsychological equivalent of the desired effect in the practitioner (i.e. it is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION924Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, 44-47.25Stanley Jeyarajah Tambiah, “The Magical Power of Words,” Man, n.s. 3 (1968),175-208; “Form and Meaning of Magical Acts,” in Robin Horton and Ruth Finnegan,eds., Modes of Thought: Essays on Thinking in Western and Non-Western Societies (London:Faber and Faber, 1972); “A Performative Approach to Ritual,” Proceedings of the BritishAcademy 65 (1979), 113-69.26Smith, “Trading Places,” 15.cathartic of the desire which provoked the magical act), and thus nofalsification occurs. Following Evans-Pritchard’s remarks,24 we might askif this does not imply a kind of idiocy or childishness: if I punch a wallbecause I am angry at someone, I do not for a moment believe that theperson in question has been punched.There have been few recent attempts to answer these questions.Perhaps the most important is Stanley Tambiah’s move to Austin’s speech-act theory, in which the words of a magic spell are granted power as“performative utterances,” like the speech-act of christening a ship.25 T hi sapproach (if extended in a more sophisticated manner) has certainpotential advantages, as we shall see in chapter four below. It permits acontextual understanding of certain types of “magical” behavior whileelevating the content of magical speech to the status of a datum, and itneatly blocks off the “if I were a horse” approach. Above all, the turntowards Austin removes the difficulty of the magician-as-charlatan: thereis no need to believe that a deliberate (as opposed to unwitting) magician,if intelligent, must necessarily be a fraud. At the same time, Tambiah’s approach ultimately prevents our makingthe distinctions which are most interesting with regard to magic, such aswhether a magical act differs from other acts. After all, if magic isunderstood simply as “performative utterance,” it cannot be distinguishedfrom the many types of such utterances not usually thought of as magical,such as the christening of a ship. In particular, many of the utterancesassociated with religious ritual would also fit into the category ofperformative utterance, such that the category of magic becomes useless.26If there is to be any utility to the term “magic,” as Durkheim and Maussnoted, it must be in some ways distinguishable from religion and science.Since the objective of the present work is to analyze the content of amagical text by a highly intelligent professional magician, we must movebeyond these classic discussions of magic and its methods. Initially, wemust be content with Agrippa’s definitions of magic, since we have no"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE1027Smith, “Trading Places,” 17.28Smith, “Trading Places,” 20.effective ones of our own. At the same time, I submit that precisely thissort of analysis provides the greatest possibility of constructing a second-order explanatory theory of magic.Note Smith’s terminological classification:. . .unlike a word such as “religion,” “magic” is not only a second-orderterm, located in academic discourse. It is as well, cross culturally, a native,first-order category, occurring in ordinary usage which has deeply influencedthe evaluative language of the scholar. Every sort of society appears to havea term (or, terms) designating some modes of ritual activities, some beliefs,and some ritual practitioners as dangerous, and/or illegal, and/or deviant.(Even some texts, conventionally labeled “magical” by scholars, themselvescontain charms and spells against what the text labels “magic.”) . . .Moreover, it is far from clear that, in many cases, these native distinctionscan be properly rendered, in all their nuances, by the common English terms“magic,” “witchcraft,” “sorcery.”27Smith here suggests that “magic” is in some way a “cross-cultural” nativeterminology, while at the same time noting that the terminologies may notbe entirely commensurate with “magic.” In addition, as noted earlier, hewants to distinguish between how “they” define magic and how modernscholars should define it:Giving primacy to native terminology yields, at best, lexical definitionswhich, historically and statistically, tell how a word is used. But, lexicaldefinitions are almost always useless for scholarly work. To remain contentwith how “they” understand “magic” may yield a proper description, butlittle explanatory power. How “they” use a word cannot substitute for thestipulative procedures by which the academy contests and controls second-order, specialized usage.28Although in a broad sense magic may often be a “native, first-ordercategory,” it is precisely so only in one case: the debates and texts aboutmagic in early modern Europe. What is more, these debates are power-fully constitutive of the modern usage of such terms as “magic,” both inand out of the academy, because of the historical continuity of thosedebates to the scientific revolution and the invention of the academy, notto mention their relevance to such texts as Goethe’s Faust."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION11If it is recognized that every translation of a term involves a compari-son, i.e. that translating the Zande term ngwa as “sorcery” meanscomparing the Zande usage of ngwa with the modern English “sorcery,”then we are led to a peculiar conclusion: every translation of a non-European term as “magic,” as well as every attempt to define a second-order “magic,” is necessarily a comparison with a number of rather poorlyunderstood practices in (particularly) early modern Europe.Thus the analysis of European magical history is a necessary preliminaryto the definition of magic as a second-order scholarly term. While wemust eventually separate the second-order usage from its history, it isimpossible to effect this separation until we have a clearer idea of what isbeing separated from what.For example, it is worth noting that essentially all modern attempts todefine “magic” have worked from the assumption that there are relativelyfew types of magic. In the Renaissance, as we shall see with Agrippa, therewere understood to be a great many different types of magic, such asnatural magic, demonic magic, mathematical magic, ceremonial magic,witchcraft, and so forth, all fairly distinct in methods and objectives. Thisgoes some way towards explaining our inability to make everythingconventionally labeled as “magic” conform to a single theoretical structure:only modern academics have ever believed that all types of magic were soconformable.The History of IdeasIn order to revive the definition of magic as a scholarly issue, it is necessaryto understand the history of the term and the debates which surroundedit; this analysis of DOP should go some way toward improving that under-standing. To achieve this, DOP must be understood in its historicalcontext, particularly the context of debates about magic.Interpreting those debates is not simple, however, and brings up theentire vexed historiography of Renaissance intellectual currents. Thediscussion which follows is by no means exhaustive, being limited to a fewclosely related historiographical approaches which have been applied tospecifically magical problems.The more traditional approach, associated particularly with historiansof science and of philosophy, concentrates heavily on issues of source andinfluence, and evidences a desire to situate the object of study within achronological trajectory.

Agrippa’ssources for DOP have been carefully detailed by Vittoria PerroneCompagni in her critical edition,30 and the earlier massive annotations ofKarl Anton Nowotny are still useful.31 Although little study has focusedon DOP ’s influence on later generations, despite Yates’s call to actionquoted above, nods in this direction have appeared in works on suchfigures as Dee, Bruno, and Robert Fludd.In spite of this wealth of scholarship, DOP remains mysterious, largelybecause the work is difficult to situate within a known intellectual currentsuch as science or philosophy. That is, DOP ’s relevance to the history ofscience is difficult to determine, inasmuch as it constantly bumps againstthe edges of modern accounts of the scientific revolution without havinghad much apparent direct influence. With regard to philosophy, Agrippa’sinfluence on thinkers such as Montaigne is well established, but DOP ’srole is unclear—it is the Pyrrhonism of De vanitate which so impressedMontaigne, and we do not know whether he ever read DOP.We thus face a conundrum. On the one hand, we know that Agrippa,and particularly DOP, had considerable influence upon at least twocenturies of magical thinking; on the other, we have been unable to situatethe author within an historical lineage that justifies this importance.Here I argue for a move away from this methodology. The approachin question is to some degree teleological, treating an author’s thought interms of the disciplines which ultimately emerged from the lineage inwhich that author participated. Historians of philosophy, for example,commonly analyze magical philosophy in light of the history of philosophymore broadly construed, as it moved towards Descartes, Bacon, andHobbes.

In that model, a figure such asParacelsus could be considered scientific when his ideas were bothscientifically accurate and new, and pre- or proto-scientific wheninaccurate.32 More recently, such scholars as Walter Pagel and AllenDebus have revised the historiography of Paracelsus, such that hisimportance to the scientific revolution depends upon his influence uponthe intellectual currents which produced that revolution; for example,Paracelsus’s work promoted a desire to look at nature anew rather thanaccepting Aristotelian and Galenic authority.While this important historiographical shift has led us to revise ourthinking about magical thinkers such as Paracelsus, Dee, and Bruno, thismethodology necessarily focuses on the thinker rather than the texts, andon the influence of the texts rather than their content. This focus hasdramatically improved our understanding of the intellectual currents of theRenaissance, but Agrippa has remained peripheral. Thus if the earlyapproach denied Agrippa any value, more recent scholarship has recog-nized his importance without being able to explain it. I argue that, giventhe influence of Agrippa’s writings, we must assume that later magicalthinkers found something of importance in their content; thus we are ledineluctably toward textual analysis as the next logical stage in thehistoriography of Renaissance magic.A less traditional approach is that associated with Frances Yates, whoin the 1960s and ‘70s inaugurated the most important rethinking ofRenaissance magical thought in modern scholarship. Her methods do notinitially seem fundamentally different from those discussed above: thesame structure of sources, influences, and situation in an intellectualcurrent is apparent in the majority of her works. However, a comparisonof methodologies quickly reveals subtle but radical differences.In her masterpiece Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Yatesunravels Bruno’s ideas in two stages.

The denoue-ment of her book discusses the fate of Hermetism after 1600 (when Brunowas burned at the stake), thus gesturing towards the influence of Brunoupon his immediate successors.The critical point of departure, emblematic of the Warburg school, isthe notion of a “Hermetic movement.” Rather than situate Bruno in thehistory of science or philosophy as commonly construed, she places himin a previously unknown intellectual movement. This movement and itshistory are traced with considerable care in Yates’s work, with periodicredefinitions—the “Hermetic” movement becomes the “Hermetic-cabalist” movement, and so forth. Having inserted this movement intoRenaissance intellectual history, she argues that it has significant points ofcontact with the history of science and philosophy. These contacts in turnlead to a demand for a drastic revision of the historiography of theperiod—after all, if prior histories of Renaissance thought did not evendiscern the presence of the movement, much less its purposes, then theremust be something terribly wrong with those prior histories.There is a complex and problematic methodology here, whichunfortunately Yates herself never made explicit. In a fascinating article onthe methodology of the Warburg school,33 Carlo Ginzburg notes astandard assessment of this method as being based upon “philologicalconcreteness and precision; objectivity and the accompanying rejection oftheoretical presuppositions and abstract hypothetical generalizations; andinterdisciplinary approaches, the shattering of academic compartments, orthose simply dictated by tradition.”34 But this school has produced twomajor theorists, Erwin Panofsky and E.H. Gombrich, and by a briefexamination of the former’s art-historical methods, we can gain someinsight into the problems and strengths of what has become the dominantstrain of scholarship of Renaissance magical currents.Panofsky, as is well known, divides the analysis of artistic images intoa tripartite structure: pre-iconographical description, iconographical"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION1535Erwin Panofsky, “Iconography and Iconology: An Introduction to the Study ofRenaissance Art,” in Meaning in the Visual Arts: Papers In and On Art History (New York,1955; reprint, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), 26-54 et passim.36Panofsky, “Iconography and Iconology,” 33.37Panofsky, “Iconography and Iconology,” 35.38Panofsky, “Iconography and Iconology,” 30-1.analysis, and iconological interpretation.35 The object of study is in eachcase different, as is the purpose and method.“Pre-iconographical description” has as its object the “primary ornatural subject matter,” that is, “the world of motifs.” Based on arelatively universal human experience, one interprets the image. Forexample, the pre-iconographical subject matter of a given painting mightbe a man crucified upon a cross. The viewer can identify the man as such,can identify the cross as a wooden, cross-shaped object, and can recognizethe man’s facial expression as agony, ecstasy, or whatever: “Everybody canrecognize the shape and behavior of human beings, animals and plants,and everybody can tell an angry face from a jovial one.”36Iconographical analysis adds historico-cultural knowledge to theinterpretation: by moving to iconography, we identify the crucified manas Jesus. Panofsky here moves from what Charles Peirce would call“iconic” relations, based on resemblance, to “symbolic” relations, whichare purely conventional in character. He uses the example of an Australianbushman, who “would be unable to recognize the subject of a Last Supper;to him it would only convey the idea of an excited dinner party.”37With the move to “iconology,” Panofsky’s method becomes at oncehighly problematic and filled with rich potential, and it is here that webegin to see Yates’s method. Iconological interpretation seeks “thoseunderlying principles which reveal the basic attitude of a nation, a period,a class, a religious or philosophical persuasion—qualified by one personal-ity and condensed into one work.” By means of this iconology, Panofskywishes to consider Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper “as a document ofLeonardo’s personality, or of the civilization of the Italian High Renais-sance, or of a peculiar religious attitude, [such that] we deal with the workof art as a symptom of something else which expresses itself in a countlessvariety of other symptoms. . . .”38Iconology of this sort marks the entire Warburg school (with thepossible exception of Gombrich): it is the attempt not only to understandsome object (a text, a painting) as a product of its historical context, butalso as in some manner representative of that context, and thereby to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE16interpret context by means of the object. The object becomes a documentfor the understanding of history, rather than an isolated aesthetic piece.In the history of ideas more generally, one crucial benefit of this“iconological” method is that it annuls the older “genius” approach, inwhich a thinker such as Descartes or Newton was represented as anisolated genius. By presupposing that the object of analysis is a documentfor understanding history, the scholar is forced to read the Meditations asrelated to the historical-cultural situation in which Descartes lived andparticipated.Put so broadly, it is difficult to argue the contrary position, thatdocuments should be forcibly removed from historical context. But is thisreally the only contrary position? If we examine the presuppositions oficonology, and the Warburg school more generally, the notions of“culture” and “history” are relatively unexamined. In addition, a complexcircularity appears in the heart of the method, which may or may not beresolvable. For purposes of brevity, I restrict this critique to three points.First, if the Last Supper is a document for understanding the ItalianHigh Renaissance, it is required that there be an Italian High Renaissance.That is, this movement must be singular, concrete, and readily definable.So for every object to be studied, it is necessary that we discover adefinable context in which to fit it. Two points follow immediately for astudy of Agrippa’s DOP : (1) we cannot use DOP as a document forunderstanding magic, since as we have seen magic is not singular, concrete,or readily definable; (2) we must situate DOP within some movement ofwhich it would be typical, even though such a movement is not previouslyknown. Frances Yates’s notion of “the Hermetic movement” is an attemptat such positioning: by postulating the existence of such a movement, textslike Agrippa’s can be seen as typical rather than peculiar.This leads to the second problem with this Warburg method: if wepostulate a “Hermetic movement” so as to make Agrippa’s work typical,then the only documentation of that movement is precisely works likeAgrippa’s. In other words, the movement is defined and described on thebasis of the very documents which it was postulated to explain. In artcriticism, the same problem obtains: if we interpret a painting in light ofits context, then try to interpret the context in light of the painting, we arein grave danger of finding only confirmation for our prior beliefs about thepainting and the historical context.

Or all at the same time? Theseveral possibilities listed (and one could adduce many others) lead toanother circularity: if some aspect of the Last Supper does not fit ourunderstanding of the Italian High Renaissance, we can simply concludethat this aspect is a datum for understanding Leonardo’s personality,moving us from history to psychology. And even supposing that one hadgreat confidence in psychological interpretations of historical figures, whatdata could we adduce for such an interpretation apart from precisely thoseaspects of Leonardo’s work which do not fit previous understandings of hishistorical context? Similarly, Yates is bound to interpret supposedlyHermetic texts entirely in that context. For example, she argues thatAgrippa must have written his retraction of DOP in order to appeasechurch authorities, who were supposedly anti-Hermetic; that theremainder of De vanitate, in which the retraction appeared, is violently andeven viciously anti-clerical is irrelevant for Yates, because the onlydocumentation she has for a “Hermetic movement” is the texts of suchmen as Agrippa, and hence they must be interpreted in that light.We are dealing here with problems of interpretation, and indeed withthe theory of interpretation. The difficulties of the Warburg method arenot the result of “fuzzy thinking” or a lack of precision; they are funda-mental problems which arise in the study of any cultural product, mademore apparent by selecting as the object of study a nearly undefinable ideasuch as magic. If earlier it seemed that Agrippa would provide a windowonto the history of “magic” as a term, it now seems that the use of Agrippaas a window onto anything is riddled with insoluble difficulties.I do not claim to have a solution to these problems, a “secret key” tooccult philosophy or magic. Instead, I suggest that these problems areprecisely where analysis needs to begin. In other words, I suggest thatproblems of interpretation are precisely the problems with which we needto investigate Agrippa.

But this brief discussion ofhermeneutics, deconstruction, and semiotics is not intended merely tointroduce and summarize the means by which I will effect my analysis ofAgrippa. On the contrary, these very methodologies can themselves beclarified and advanced by application to Agrippa. In the present volume,critical theories are not simple lenses for examination, but rather philo-sophical ideas in conversation with the text, thus negating a fallaciousdistinction between “primary” and “secondary” sources, “object of study”and “method for study.”When reading Agrippa, one cannot avoid being struck by the centralityof linguistic and textual issues. Like so many Christian thinkers in all ages,Agrippa uses the terminology of “two books” written by God for theinstruction of humanity: Scripture and Nature. Within the field of theRenaissance history of science, much time has been devoted to thequestion of reading Nature, with particular emphasis on its relationship tothe development of modern science.40 DOP, however, does not seem toprivilege either book over the other, but rather describes techniques forreading both books, separately and in parallel, and also suggests thepossibility of writing in (or at least parallel to) these two books. Book I ofDOP, devoted to Natural Magic, focuses almost entirely on the book ofNature; Books II and III, on Mathematical and Ceremonial Magic, takeup various abstruse exegetical techniques, some derived from Kabbalah,others from Christian theological and philosophical sources. All of thesemethods seem to be both exegetical and, if you will, in-getical, based onactive writing, in addition to the semi-passive reading of exegesis: magicalhermeneutics—hermetic hermeneutics, we might say—is a primary issue"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION1941This is not to say that the hermeneutic circle is a universally valid phenomenon, butrather that the attempt to analyze anything as such a circle pre-establishes certaincharacteristics of the analytical object.in the work. In order to examine the nature of magical practice in DOP,then, it will be necessary to take up these techniques of magical readingand writing, and my own hermeneutics must be guided by those of thetext. In reading DOP, then, we are reading a book about reading.But who is reading what? All modern formulations of the dynamics ofinterpretation agree that the intentions and ideas of the author areinaccessible; in addition, I have argued above that this interpretation ofDOP must turn away from Agrippa and towards the text itself—to usePaul Ricoeur’s lovely formulation, the analytical focus of the reading is infact necessarily upon “the world in front of the text.” Thus the issue ofauthor largely drops from consideration, to be replaced by an implied orprojected authorial (or other) voice. For DOP, the projected author is amagus, one who has to some degree succeeded in the objectives of magic,thus establishing his credentials as an authority on magic.In DOP, the magus reads the books of Scripture and Nature—but thesetexts are not precisely the same as those to which a modern reader hasaccess, but rather projections in the same way as the magus is a projection.For example, the text of Nature as it appears in DOP includes occult forceswhose reality a modern scientist would not accept. Thus the world infront of DOP includes projected texts distinctive to that world, as well asa projected magus who reads and interprets the texts.Between the projected magus and the projected texts there existsnecessarily a hermeneutic circle, an interpretive process of the magusentering the text and returning for philosophical reflection. After all, themagus is a reader of texts, and those texts are both autonomous and tosome degree created by the magus in his role as hermeneut. Since thishermeneutic circle is central to the magical perspective of DOP, it seemslogical that a modern scholar can analyze this projected circle.The ramifications of this conclusion are considerable. Hermeneuticcircles, if analyzed as such, have certain universal characteristics.41 Nei therAgrippa nor the projected magus can avoid these characteristics—pre-understanding, aporia, disjuncture, reflection, etc.—any more than can amodern scholar, although the terminology is of course modern.Two effects of this method of analysis are particularly worth noting.First, it is difficult to avoid the charge that any interpretation attempts to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE20“make present” something about the object of interpretation. Tradition-ally, the notion was that perfect interpretation would make the author’strue meaning present; this has been discredited, to be replaced by varioustheories about the potential presence of some interactively constructedmeaning more or less cognate with at least some “real” meaning in thetext. The purpose of the analytical method proposed here is somewhatdifferent: by entering into an interpretive relationship with a hermeneuticcircle, what is made present is itself a process of making-present. In short,what is reconstructed in this analysis is neither Agrippa nor Agrippa’s “realmeaning,” but rather certain aspects of the logocentrism implied by theworld in front of DOP.Second, if the hermeneutic circles of the world in front of DOP are anattempt to make something present, it seems clear that the “something” inquestion is the real intention of the Author of the Texts, i.e. God. To putthis another way, the very structure of DOP as a hermeneutical endeavoralready ensures that the objective of the occult philosophy is to makeGod’s true intentions present to the magus. This has a very specificmeaning in Renaissance thought: it can only refer to an attempt to reachsome form of mystical unity with God.Thus, by shifting the object of study from Agrippa to the implicithermeneutic project in front of DOP, we both clarify the magical projectof the occult philosophy, and also set that philosophy into direct conversa-tion with modern linguistic and hermeneutic philosophies.I have raised the haunting specter of “logocentrism” in the precedingdiscussion; it remains to explain not only what I mean by this but also how(and why) I intend to apply Jacques Derrida’s famous idea. Parallel to thesearch for hermeneutic circles, I plan not to deconstruct DOP (or discoverhow it deconstructs itself), but instead to seek in DOP certain fundamentalprinciples of deconstruction. This is not to say that the occult philosophyis deconstruction avant la lettre, any more than seeking hermeneutic circlesimplies that Agrippa is already a post-Gadamerian theorist of hermeneu-tics. Rather, I argue that Agrippa’s magic was part of a philosophicalmovement which contained within itself the seeds of Derrida’s theory ofgrammatology, though the vagaries of the intellectual history of the earlymodern period shifted the focus of philosophical reflection away fromthose seeds until, more or less coincidentally, they resurfaced in (post-)modern times.

I haveeliminated all the Greek from the text except the one crucial word pharmakon. which history failed to turn, or at which it turned differently than Agrippamight have hoped.Logocentrism is the crucial idea here. Derrida argues that the historyof western thought has usually granted speech (logos) priority over writing,such that speech is understood as a more or less direct representation ofthought, while writing is only a representation of speech and hence moredistant, more fallen, more false. At the same time, he demonstrates thatthis idea deconstructs itself: discussions of the primacy of speech cannotavoid the haunting presence of writing. Writing is said to be a “supple-ment,” in the sense that it is an (unnecessary) addition to speech. YetDerrida notes that “supplement” has a double meaning: a supplement isalways a necessary addition. For example, the supplementary volumes toa dictionary include entries not in the main volumes, and are necessary forthe dictionary to be complete; the supplement is thus external and yetcrucial to the entirety of the work.Derrida’s arguments are infamously complex; here I only sketch anoutline of part of one particularly relevant version: the essay “Plato’sPharmacy,”42 which discusses Plato’s dialogue Phaedrus and particularlythe section on a supposedly Egyptian myth of the origins of writing.To summarize the myth briefly, the god Theuth (Thoth, more or lessequivalent to Hermes) approaches the king (Thamus/Ammon, king of thegods as well as of Egypt) and offers him the arts which Theuth hasinvented, particularly the art of writing.Theuth said, “This discipline, my King, will make the Egyptians wiser andwill improve their memories: my invention is a recipe (pharmakon) for bothmemory and wisdom.” But the king said, “. . . .[T]his invention willproduce forgetfulness in the souls of those who have learned it because theywill not need to exercise their memories, being able to rely on what iswritten, using the stimulus of external marks that are alien to themselvesrather than, from within, their own unaided powers to call things to mind.So it’s not a remedy for memory, but for reminding, that you havediscovered. And as for wisdom, you’re equipping your pupils with only asemblance of it, not with the truth. . . .”43"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE2244Although it could certainly be argued that this phenomenon is more universal thanthe history of western “metaphysics,” Derrida does not (so far as I know) expand hishistorical application of the theory except in oblique hints, presumably because he isneither an historian nor an expert on non-western intellectual currents.The crucial word for Derrida’s discussion is pharmakon [NVD:\"6@<],meaning both medicine and poison: Theuth brings writing as apharmakon/remedy for memory, but the king recognizes it as apharmakon/poison. Thus for Plato, writing has the appearance of wisdom,truth, and memory, but is in fact destructive of all these, creating a deadsemblance of memory and a shadowy imitation of truth. Derrida arguesthat this pharmakon is a supplement in the sense given above: Theuthwould not present writing as a medicine if there were no sickness. Thusthe invention of writing implies that speech always already lacks some-thing, that it is incomplete, that it requires a supplement.In many of his works, Derrida argues that this logocentric phenome-non, this constant desperate attempt to recapture presence by furthersupplementation, is part of the long heritage of western philosophy fromPlato onward.44 For our purposes, however, it is significant that hishistory of philosophy (borrowed from Heidegger) skips the occultphilosophies of the Renaissance, presumably because they rarely had muchdirect influence upon what we now think of as the mainstream ofphilosophy. But when considering Derrida’s philosophy in the context ofRenaissance magic, certain peculiarities are interestingly suggestive.First, it is not coincidental that Theuth, inventor of writing, alsoinvented such arts as astrology, medicine—and magic. In a sense, magicis mythologically bound up with writing; indeed, Renaissance magic (suchas Agrippa’s) can be read as the ultimate pharmakon for the lack ofpresence. It is hardly surprising that Theuth is generally equated withHermes, the patron deity as it were of Renaissance magicians.Second, a unique conjunction occurred in early modern occultphilosophy, between classical western philosophies (Neoplatonic andAristotelian) and Jewish thought, particularly Kabbalah. Kabbalah is (ifone can generalize) primarily oriented around text, specifically Hebrewtext. It was commonly accepted that Hebrew was the pre-Babel language,the language of Adam and of God, the language in which Adam named allthe animals “and whatever the man called every living creature, that wasits name” (Gen. 3:19). As has been discussed by historians of linguistics"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION   2345E.g.

As we shall see in chapter 3, this Renaissance occult theoryunderstands Hebrew words to have meaning because of divine decree, which is importantlydistinct from nature (see page 134 below). Furthermore, Agrippa is unusual amongChristian Kabbalists in not granting Hebrew absolute primacy (see page 198 below).and semiotics,45 this was taken to mean that the Hebrew language was notarbitrary in the linguistic sense: Hebrew words and letters connected totheir referents not by cultural convention but by divine fiat.46 In otherwords, the occult philosophers saw in Kabbalah an ancient and holyscience which could discern and demonstrate the presence of God in Scripture.I suggest, then, that DOP can be read as an attempt to solve theproblem of logocentrism by an appeal to the prisca magia: DOP ’s magususes ancient holy magical techniques to make manifest the immanentpresence of the Divine in the world. This establishes a communicationbetween the magus and God which relies neither on speech nor text, buton the undifferentiated absolute Word of God (Christ/Logos) by meansof which God created the world.Thus the magical project of DOP is one of rising through the spokenand written manifestations of the Word (Nature and Scripture, respec-tively) to the true, undifferentiated Word, the Word which requires nosupplement, which is itself presence. If Derrida reminds us that all languageis haunted by absence, Agrippa recognizes this problem and seeks asolution in magic, through a kind of reconstructive deconstruction of theuniverse itself. Which attempt is perhaps the most extreme form oflogocentrism possible.On the opposite extreme, the search for immanent presence in theuniverse can lead to endless semiosis; the semiotician Umberto Eco callsthis “Hermetic drift,” and ascribes it to Giordano Bruno and otherHermetic thinkers:I shall call Hermetic drift the interpretive habit which dominated Renais-sance Hermetism and which is based on the principles of universal analogyand sympathy, according to which every item of the furniture of the worldis linked to every other element (or to many) of this sublunar world and toevery element (or to many) of the superior world by means of similitudes orresemblances.

But this indispensable guard-rail has always only protected, it has never opened a reading’” (ibid., 37).

Thedifficulty of this type of semiosis is that it is unlimited: if every element islinked to every other, the process of meaning-relations can never end, andno final determination of even a functional meaning can be made.Considering the previous discussion of Derrida and magic, it shouldcome as no surprise that Eco’s other example of “unlimited semiosis” isthat which he ascribes to “irresponsible” deconstructionists. For them, theprocess of supplementation and deconstruction leads to an infinite pathwithout any potential for ending in meaning. That is, the results of anyinterpretive act are determined by the preconceptions of the interpreter,and have essentially no connection with the object interpreted.48But in Agrippa’s magic, as already indicated, there is an end-point: theprocess of unlimited semiosis is fixed to an unlimited Meaning, i.e. God,because Christ breaks the unending cycle of interpretation as the IncarnateWord. Every element of Creation connects to every other because everyelement is part of the Divine plan, and hence each piece is an essentialelement in a single, infinitely large meaning. The object of the occultphilosophy thus becomes the search for connections, because theseconnections are constitutive of Meaning.

As the present work is a close reading of DOP, thefollowing merely summarizes prior scholarship. Early Years (1486-1518)Born in Cologne in 1486 to a family of minor nobility or upper bourgeoi-sie, Agrippa matriculated in 1499 at the University of Cologne, receivingthe magister artium in 1502. Considering the traditionalism of theCologne university, it is no surprise that the iconoclastic Agrippa latercriticized the instruction.50 He learned some astrology from his father,who died in 1519, and it seems certain that Agrippa’s abiding interest inesoteric learning began early.51Between 1507 and 1509 he traveled extensively, spending time in Parisand Spain, possibly in service to Emperor Maximilian I. Apparently healso formed or joined a secret society of like-minded occult students, butwe have minimal information as he swore an oath of secrecy.52In 1509 Agrippa visited Johannes Trithemius, Abbot of Sponheim, adistinguished humanist, theologian, and expert on cryptography andmagic, to whom shortly thereafter he sent the complete Juvenile Draftmanuscript of DOP.53 Trithemius approved, and encouraged Agrippa to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE26Trithemius (1462-1516): The Renaissance of Monastic Humanism (Leiden: E.J.

UnfortunatelyJean Catilinet, provincial superior of the Franciscans for Burgundy,denounced Agrippa as a “judaizing heretic” (haereticum Iudaisantem ). Ina pattern that would be typical for Agrippa, he was accused of heresybehind his back, and could not defend himself until later. The defense, inthe form of a letter to Catilinet, was dated 1510 but published in 1529.55During 1510, Agrippa was in London, apparently serving secret ends,perhaps on behalf of Maximilian I.56 At any rate, he studied St. Paul withJohn Colet, and began a commentary on Romans, not extant. Apart froma few brief trips, however, Agrippa spent 1511 through 1518 in Italy,caught in the French-Italian wars; Agrippa was involved in these militaryaffairs on the side of the Emperor.During a sojourn at Pavia in 1512 he probably taught a course on theSymposium, the inaugural lecture of which survives,57 and upon returningin 1515 another course on the Pimander, the first dialogue of theHermetica.58 He also wrote Dialogus de homine, which survives infragments, an excursus on the anthropology of Pico’s Heptaplus.59"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION2760Liber de triplici ratione cognoscendi Dei, in Opera, 2, 454-81; partial edition by PaolaZambelli, in Eugenio Garin et al., eds., Testi umanistici sull’ ermetismo.

Agrippa also acquired a patron, Guglielmo Paleologo (1494-1518),Marquis of Monferrato, and to him in 1516 dedicated his most importantwork of this period, Liber de triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum (hereafter Detriplici ).60 During this period Agrippa likely wrote a draft of Dehortatiogentilis theologiae, which van der Poel suggests should be read as a seventhchapter of De triplici ; the work was printed in 1529.61 At the end of his time in Italy, Agrippa lectured on scripture in Turin,and wrote an oration for a student taking a doctorate in law.62Middle Years (1518-28)In 1518, Agrippa once more sought a patron. Though briefly involvedwith Charles III, Duke of Savoy, he took up a position as legal advisor tothe free Imperial city of Metz. He also acquired many friends during histime in Germany, and their surviving letters reflect wide-ranging interests.While in Metz, Agrippa became embroiled in a fight about the legendthat Saint Anne was married three times, each time giving birth to adaughter called Mary (the Virgin and two others). Agrippa supportedJacques Lefèvre d’Etaples (c.1460-1536) against this theory, and was againaccused of heresy—as usual anonymously, making direct confrontationimpossible.63 He immediately wrote a Defensio in an angry, sarcastic stylewhich would be typical of his later refutations, rebuttals, and apologies.64The same period saw the famous witch trial, in which Agrippa achievedthe acquittal of a woman accused of witchcraft. His victory over InquisitorNicolas Savin involved legal and theological arguments on witchcraft, sin,and proper legal process for torture and interrogation of prisoners.65"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE2866Morley, 2, 152: “If we bear in mind the disappointments and distresses in the midstof which this bitter jest was written, and the life also that prepared the author for his work,we shall know perfectly well the meaning.” In Epistolae 4: 41 (21 September, 1526), 819,Agrippa complains that “id ipsum tibi repeto, me ab isto Buillione mirum in modumfraudatum. Tuas literas, quas illi ad me deferendas tradidisse scribis, non accepisse mescias: et fratrem eiusdem Bullionis negare, sibi quicquam scriptum, aut commissum.”67Epistolae 4, 41 (ibid.): “Salutat te charissima coniunx mea, quae laborat duplicitertiana, timeoque admodum, ne ob animi moestitiam labatur in quartanam.”68Agrippa apparently worked as a physician, fighting the plague, and it is likely thathis experiences here were the source for his Regimen adversas pestilentiam.Agrippa’s involvement in these conflicts made his position untenable.He moved to Cologne in 1520, then to Geneva in 1521, where he workedas a physician. His wife died either in Geneva or on the journey, and wasburied in Metz; he took a second wife in Geneva, with whom he had sixchildren. In 1522 he negotiated a position with Charles III, Duke ofSavoy, but eventually moved to Freiburg as town physician in 1523.In 1524, he became physician to Louise of Savoy; unfortunately, theydisagreed intensely, as Agrippa was offended by her demands for astrologi-cal prognostications, for the popular form of which he had little respect.When Louise left Lyon in 1525, she ordered him to remain, and the royaltreasurers stopped paying his salary.In 1526, Agrippa completed his famous De vanitate, a scathing satireon all human knowledge. Some have suggested that its acid pessimismarose from bitter disappointment with the French court, about whose“treachery” he complains in several letters; this is plausible, if simplistic.66Agrippa also published Declamatio de sacramento matrimonii, dedicatedto the widowed sister of King Francis I, Margaret of Angoulême, duchessof Alençon. Presumably he hoped to regain favor, but instead courttheologians criticized the work to the Queen Mother. As usual, thecriticism was done behind Agrippa’s back, and he could not respond.Understandably, given his precarious position, Agrippa offered hisresignation in July 1527, and left for Antwerp in the end of that year.Final Years (1528-35)The journey to Antwerp was delayed, and he arrived in July, 1528; hisfamily joined him in October.67 Agrippa worked for Margaret of Austria,governor of the Low Countries, and spent a peaceful few years there, apartfrom the death of his wife in the plague which swept Antwerp in 1529.68"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION2969Apologia adversus calumnias propter Decalamationem de Vanitate scientiarum, &excellentia verbi Dei, sibi per aliquos Lovanienses Theologistas intentatas.

He also published a volumecontaining De nobilitate, Expostulatio, De triplici, De sacramento matrimo-nii, Dehortatio, De originali peccato, and Regimen adversas pestilentiam.In September 1530, Agrippa published De vanitate  ; despite thePrivilege Margaret worried about its orthodoxy. Without seekingAgrippa’s opinion, she sent to the Faculty of Theology at Louvain, whenceit was sent to the Emperor’s brother Ferdinand, who took exception to itsskepticism and wrote about it to the Emperor. The Faculty denounced Devanitate on eighteen points, presented to the Imperial Privy Council in (asusual) a secret document. Agrippa, furious that once again he had beenattacked without the opportunity to respond, wrote both an angry Querelaagainst his accusers and an Apologia defending the book.69 These wereeventually published in 1533, anonymously, but De vanitate had beenpublicly condemned by the Sorbonne Faculty on March 2, 1531.Agrippa’s troubles put him out of favor and reduced him to poverty. In1530 he moved to Malines, where in 1531 he was imprisoned for debt.Shortly after his release in early 1532, Agrippa traveled to Cologne tovisit the Archbishop elector, Hermann von Wied, with whom he hadbegun correspondence in early 1531. At that time, in fact, the first bookof his much-revised DOP had appeared in several editions at Cologne,Antwerp, and Paris, with a dedicatory epistle to von Wied.Agrippa now began publishing DOP. Typically, in 1532 the CologneInquisitor, Konrad Köllin of Ulm, preached against the book as heretical.Agrippa of course responded with venom, in three works: an addressdefending himself and attacking the Cologne Faculty of Theology,aligning himself with Erasmus and Reuchlin;70 a book on the CologneDominicans’ heresies, not extant;71 and finally a preface to the writings of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE30e gli insquisitori,” Memorie Dominicane 89 (1972), 69-103; see also Van der Poel, 45-46.72Van der Poel, 44.

He petitionedMargaret of Hungary, now governor of the Low Countries, for paymentof his overdue salary, and continued relations with the publisher JohannesSoter in Cologne.72 In 1533 his commentary on the “Ars brevis” ofRamon Lull was published,73 as was at long last the complete DOP. In1535 Soter also published an edition of Agrippa’s collected orations, butit is unclear whether Agrippa was involved with this.Suddenly in 1533, Agrippa vanishes. No correspondence survives, andhis final years are unknown. According to his student Johann Weyer(1515-88), Agrippa took a wife, but repudiated her in 1535. He traveledto Lyon, was briefly imprisoned by Francis I, and died in Grenoble.74 After his death, stories of Agrippa’s traffic with demons circulated,leading to his incorporation into the Faust legends and his reputation forblack magic. In one story, an anonymous boarder or student of Agrippa’scomes to a bad end. As Martín Del Rio tells it:This happened to Cornelius Agrippa at Louvain. He had a boarder, whowas too curious, and Agrippa having once gone somewhere, had given thekeys of his museum to the wife whom he afterwards divorced, forbiddingher to allow any one to enter.

Hark! there is knocking at the door;he is disturbed; but he goes on with his reading; some one knocks again; andthe unmannerly youth answering nothing to this, a demon enters, asks whyis he called? What is it commanded him to do? Fear stifles the youth’svoice, the demon his mouth, and so he pays the price of his unholycuriosity. In the meantime the chief magician returns home, sees the devilsdancing over him, uses the accustomed arts, they come when called, explainhow the thing happened; he orders the homicide spirit to enter the corpse,and to walk now and then in the market-place (where other students wereaccustomed frequently to meet), at length to quit the body. He walks threeor four times, then falls; the demon that had stirred the dead limbs takingflight. It was long thought that this youth had been seized with suddendeath, but signs of suffocation first begot suspicion, afterwards timedivulged all.75Another typical story is that of Agrippa’s black dog, which resurfaced asFaust’s schwarze Püdel.76 M. Thevet recounts this story in purple prose:At last, having betaken himself to Lyons, very wretched, and deprived of hisfaculties [!], he tried all the means that he could to live, waving, as dexter-ously as he could, the end of his stick, and yet gained so little, that he diedin a miserable inn, disgraced and abhorred before all the world, whichdetested him as an accursed and execrable magician, because he alwayscarried about with him as his companion a devil in the figure of a dog, fromwhose neck, when he felt death approaching, he removed the collar, figuredall over with magic characters, and afterwards, being in a half-mad state, hedrove it from him with these words: “Go, vile beast, by whom I am broughtutterly to perdition.” And afterwards this dog, which had been so familiarwith him, and been his assiduous companion in his travels, was no moreseen; because, after the command Agrippa gave him, he began to runtowards the Saône, where he leapt in, and never came out thence, for whichreason it is judged that he was drowned there.77"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE3278Weyer, De praestigiis, 113. Nauert (ch. 12: “Fact and Fantasy: Agrippa’s Positionin Intellectual History,” 322-34) uncovers many hidden ways in which Agrippa, as botha thinker and a figure of legend, had a significant impact on later literature and thought.Weyer’s refutation of this story tells more about Agrippa’s personality andhabits than any other single source:I will no longer allow a statement that I have read in several different writersto be wrapped in silence—namely, that the Devil, in the form of a dog, hadbeen a companion to Agrippa right up until his last breath, and that he thenvanished somehow or other. It never ceases to amaze me that men of suchrepute sometimes speak, think, and write so foolishly on the basis of an idlerumor that had circulated. The dog was black, of moderate stature, and wasnamed Monsieur in French. . . and if anyone knew him well, I did, since Ioften walked him on a rope leash when I was studying under Agrippa. . . .I think that this false rumor arose partly because Agrippa was too childishlyfond of this dog (as some people are), very often kissing him, and sometimesputting him by his side at the table, just as he allowed him in bed with himunder the covers at night, after he had repudiated his [third] wife. . . . Also,the rumor arose partly because my master, though he constantly hid himselfamong his papers . . . and scarcely came out once in eight days, wasnevertheless usually informed about what was going on in differentcountries. Some persons of little prudence used to attribute this fact, in mypresence, to the dog—as being a demon; but in truth Agrippa receivedletters daily from every region, written by eminent scholars.78WorksAgrippa wrote a great many treatises, orations, declamations, and letters.It is unnecessary to survey all of these here, but a few points need to besummarized: first, De vanitate, arguably Agrippa’s most influential work;next, a summary of DOP itself, and a brief account of the Juvenile Draft;and finally, the famous retraction of 1526.De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum atque artium, atque excellentia verbiDei declamatio (1526)De vanitate, undoubtedly Agrippa’s best-known work, consists essentiallyof a scathing satirical assault on all forms of human knowledge, at timesgracefully written, at others heavy-handed and inelegant.

Allen (Oxford: Clarendon, 1938), no. 2796 (10:203).All the letters between Agrippa and Erasmus may be found in Allen, vol. 9, nos. 2544,2589, 2626; and vol. 10, nos. 2692, 2737, 2739, 2748, 2790, 2796.destined to be extremely influential on the thought of the later sixteenthcentury, notably on Montaigne and (negatively) Descartes; rather later, itwas to cause a minor crisis in the thought of the young Goethe.79De vanitate has been compared to Nicholas of Cusa’s On LearnedIgnorance, works in praise of the ass such as that of Apuleius, and especiallyErasmus’s Praise of Folly. Indeed, Erasmus himself commented positivelyon De vanitate, although one has the impression that he felt it to be far toovicious, and that he disapproved of Agrippa’s war with the monks:I liked the emotional force [*,\\<TF4H] of your language and the richnessof your material, and I do not understand why the monks are so offended.As you censure the bad ones, so you praise the good ones, but they only liketo be praised.

Ofthis, before everything, take heed that you do not mix me up with thematter: I am burdened with more than enough ill-will, and this wouldtrouble me, while doing you more harm than good.80The structure of De vanitate is simple enough, beginning with a bitinglysatirical letter to the reader listing everyone to be criticized in the book andwhat they will think of its author:"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE3481De vanitate, Ad lectorem, 6-8/7-8: “. . .ultra Sauromatas & glacialem relegabunt vagiCosmimetrae. . . .Peccata reservabunt aeternis ignibus plenipotentes Pontifices.

The Almighty Bishops will reserve my sins for Everlastingfire. The Lecherous Whores will threaten to give me the French Pox.81Agrippa then moves on to 102 chapters (103 including the conclusion),each attacking a particular art. For each, he gives a brief account of thecontent and history of the art, then goes on to attack its professors.The mode of critique varies with the subject. In some cases, as with theart of Goetia or Necromancy,82 Agrippa simply points out various classicaland scriptural authorities for the condemnation of these “rites of detestablecuriosity” (nefariae curiositatis ritibus) and lists a number of famousnecromancers and books of goetic magic.83More often, he engages in satire reminiscent of (if generally less elegantthan) Erasmus’s Encomium moriae, as in his brutal assault on monks: . . .at this day in many countries they alone usurp the holy name ofReligion, and do boast that they are the companions of Christ, and fellowmates of the Apostles: whose life oftentimes is most wicked full of covetous-ness, of luxuriousness, of gluttony, ambition, of indiscreetness, of knavery,and stored with all kinds of mischief, but always unpunished for thepretense of Religion.84Such attacks are often augmented by the juxtaposition of chapters, as whenthe chapter on monks is followed by that “On the whorish Art”:very many houses of Nuns and Beguines be as it were private stews ofharlots, which we know also that Monks and religious persons (lest theirchastity should be defamed) have oftentimes maintained in monasteriesunder a Monk’s hood and man’s apparel.85"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION3586De vanitate 25, 59-60/82.

I learned in time past in Italy, that there was in Pictures and Images anauthority greatly to be esteemed: for whereas there was an obstinate strifebetween the Augustine Friars and the vulgar Canons before the Pope,concerning the habit or apparel of St. Augustine, that is to say, whether hedid wear a black weed [habit] upon a white Coat, or a white weed upon ablack Coat. And finding nothing in the Scriptures which made to theending of this strife, the Roman Judges thought good to prefer the wholematter to Painters, and Image Makers, and that which they could avouchout of Ancient Pictures and Images should be held for a Definitive sentence.I being grounded upon this example, when sometime with exceeding greatdiligence I searched for the Original of the Friars’ cowl, and could findnothing for that matter in the Scriptures, at length, I went me to thePainters. . . . and again diligently examining every thing from the beginning,immediately in the forepart of the History the Devil was painted with aCowl, to wit, he which went to tempt Christ in the Desert. I rejoicedexceedingly that I had found that in the picture which until that time Icould not see in writing: that is to say, that the Devil was the first author ofthe Cowl, of whom afterward, I suppose, that other Monks and Friars tookup the fashion under diverse colors, or perhaps have retained it as a thingleft to them by inheritance.86 When he discusses arts for which he has some respect, however, the attacksbecome more specifically directed at errors, though he never passes up anopportunity to snipe at monks or scholastic theologians. Agrippa’s attackon scriptural interpretation, for example, merely warns that:all the interpreting Divines, forasmuch as they are men, they also sufferhuman things, in one place they err, in another they write contraries andrepugnances, oftentimes they disagree from themselves, in many things, theygo besides the mark, and every man seeth not all things.87"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE3688De vanitate 98, 289-90/362: “Hic tamen altiore opus est spiritu, qui diiudicet atquediscernat, qui videlicet non ex hominibus, nec ex carne et sanguine, sed desuper datus sita patre luminum: de Deo enim sine eius lumine nemo rite quicquam effari potest, lumenautem illud est verbum Dei, per quod omnia facta sunt, illuminans omnem venientem inhunc mundum, dans illis potestatem filios Dei ficri, quotquot receperunt, et credideruntei.”89Popkin, Scepticism, 23-26.The argument of De vanitate is not that all knowledge is worthless, as hassometimes been maintained, but rather that no knowledge can have valueunless it is guided by faith. In interpretation, for example,it is needful to have a higher spirit to judge and discern, which is not givenus by men, nor by flesh and blood, but is given from above by the father oflight, for none without his light can truly speak any godly thing. And thislight is God’s word, by which all things are made, giving light to every manthat cometh into this world, and giving them power to be made the sons ofGod.88The work ends with a lengthy discussion of the word of God and anencomium on the virtues of the ass (caps.100 and 102).De vanitate is part of the genre of skeptical and satirical reformist worksof the period, of which the most famous is Erasmus’s Encomium moriae.Agrippa’s main contribution here is his early use of Pyrrhonist skepticismand his comprehensive survey of all human knowledge.89De occulta philosophia libri tres (1510/1531/33)DOP is divided into three books, explicitly connected with the Neoplaton-ic worlds (natural, celestial, divine). As the remainder of the present workreads DOP closely, I give only a brief summary here.Each book of DOP begins with dedicatory epistles. The work openswith Agrippa’s letter to Trithemius, which prefaced the juvenile draft of1510, to which is appended Trithemius’s response. This is followed by aletter to Hermann von Wied, Archbishop Elector of Cologne, written forthe 1531 printing of Book I. Books II and III each begin with letters toHermann von Wied, written for the final 1533 printing of the entireDOP. These epistles are not of much interest for the present analysis ofDOP, though we shall return to parts of them here and there, but onepassage from the third letter to von Wied is worth quoting at length:"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION3790DOP I: e.d., 399/435: “Hoc autem solum et maxime praestat nobis divinae scientiaenotio, quando eius maiestatis recordatione divinis semper studiis occupati, res divinas peromnia horarum momenta sagaci ac pervigili inquisitione contemplamur et, per singuloscreatorum gradus ad ipsum usque Archetypum ascendendtes, ab illo rerum omniuminerrabilem haurimus virtutem; quam qui negligunt, naturalibus et mundanis tantummodoconfidentes, hi solent variis saepe erroribus ac fallentiis confundi et a malis daemonibussaepissime falli.

But the understandingof divine things purgeth the mind from errors, and rendereth it divine,giveth infallible power to our works, and driveth far the deceits and obstaclesof all evil spirits, and together subjects them to our command.90This importantly reverses the usual criticism of Agrippa as magician, thathe strays beyond licit natural magic into dangerous demonic magic.91 T heargument here is precisely the contrary: without ceremonial, demonicmagic, natural (and presumably celestial) magic tends to slip into evil anddarkness. As the present analysis will show, this argument is that ofDOP in nuce, and is subtly consistent with De vanitate.Turning to the body of the text, Book I, on Natural Magic, opens witha brief synopsis of the work (ch. 1), followed by a definition of magic andits parts (ch. 2). Next we turn to the elements (chs. 3-8) and the occultvirtues which depend upon them (chs. 9-13). Next comes a general theoryof these virtues and their discovery (chs. 14-22), and astrological ascrip-tions of virtues and elements (chs. 23-34), interleaved with a discussion ofseals and characters (ch. 33). Next come mixtures of elements and virtues,and how they are attracted and drawn (chs. 35-39), followed by specificdiscussions of magical techniques for this purpose (chs. 40-50). Thisgeneral discussion is followed by specific examples in chapter 51, fromwhich we move to forms of divination (chs. 52-60).

Each number from one to twelve receives a special discussionand a shorthand table (chs. 4-14), followed by a chapter (15) on numberslarger than twelve. Chapters 16-21 discuss notations for numbers, fromgestures to letters of alphabets, as well as the pagan gods and elements withwhich numbers are associated; chapter 22 discusses a set of magic squaresfrom which are derived special characters associated with demonic beings.We move on to harmony and proportion, in the related senses ofgeometry, music, and human proportions (chs. 23-28), followed by adiscussion of the planets and other objects of the heavens (29-34). We aretold that every celestial object can be associated with an image, seal, orcharacter, and these images are described in a series of short chaptersdevoted to each celestial object (35-47). Images and characters notspecifically connected to objects but rather to ideas or forces, take up thenext two chapters (48-9), and chapter 50 contains the second majorapplied discussion, “the practice of some images.” From these images,DOP moves on to abstract written characters (51-2), divination byastrology and lottery (53-4), and an analysis of the World-Soul and howit relates to the celestial powers (55-7). The highest of the celestial powers,which participate in the divine, are named and described (58-9), and thebook concludes with an explanation of how it is that the human mind iscapable of controlling and directing these celestial agencies.Book III, on Ceremonial Magic, begins with an explanation ofreligion’s importance to magic, including secrecy, purity, and a set ofdistinctions between religion, superstition, theology, and so forth (chs. 1-6). Next comes a general discussion of the nature of God (chs. 7-9),followed by divine names (chs. 10-14). The argument moves down thecelestial hierarchy to intelligences, spirits, demons, and angels, anddiscusses classification and characteristics (chs. 15-22).

The next several chaptersdeal with ritual purity and preparations for magical ceremonies (chs. 54-64), and then DOP ends quite abruptly with a very important chapterentitled simply, “The conclusion of the whole work” (ch. 65).The Juvenile DraftThe juvenile draft of 1510 is miraculously preserved in its original form,as the extant copy appears to be the presentation copy sent to Trithemius.Vittoria Perrone Compagni has constructed a comparative table ofcontents of this manuscript against the final draft; here only a few briefnotes need be made.92The juvenile draft is considerably shorter, and in some respectsstructured differently from the final version. Several chapters shift fromone book to another, while others are broken across two or more finalchapters. Two of Agrippa’s most important sources, Reuchlin’s De artecabalistica and Francesco Zorzi’s De harmonia mundi, had not beenwritten in 1510, and their incorporation dramatically expands the text,particularly in its treatment of Kabbalah.In the course of the present work, it will periodically be important thatcertain passages and chapters do or do not appear in the juvenile draft, andthis is mentioned where appropriate. Nonetheless, there is more consis-tency than difference between the two drafts, just as the bulk of Agrippa’swritings represent a consistent development of a core philosophy.93The RetractionThe classic argument against Agrippa’s consistency derives from chapter48 of De vanitate, devoted to illusions (praestigiae), where Agrippa givesthis famous retraction of DOP :"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE4094De vanitate 48, 104-5/141-2: “Verum de magicis scripsi ego iuvenis adhuc librostres, amplo satis volumine, quos de Occulta philosophia nucupavi: in quibus quidquid tuncper curiosam adolescentiam erratum est, nunc cautior hac palinodia recantatum volo:permultum enim temporis et rerum in his vanitatibus olim contrivi.

At the length Igot this profit thereby, that I know by what means I should discourage anddissuade others from this destruction. For all they that presume to divineand prophecy not in the truth, not in the virtue of God, but in the illusionof devils, according to the operation of wicked spirits, and exercising deceitsof idolatry, and showing illusions and vain visions, the which suddenlyceasing, they avaunt that they can work miracles, by Magical vanities,exorcisms, enchantments, drinks of love, Agogimes, and other devilishworks, all these with Iamnes and Mambres and Simon Magus shall becondemned to the pains of everlasting fire.94This retraction has occasioned many theories and explanations, because itseems clear that Agrippa continued to work on the final version of DOPduring the 1520's, and it is certain that he was revising furiously in theperiod immediately preceding the final publication of the work in 1533.Auguste Prost argued that Agrippa ceased believing in magic, asevidenced by the retraction, and that in later life “tout cela est pourAgrippa exercice et jeu d’esprit. C’est peut-être bien plutôt ce qu’onappellerait aujourd’hui oeuvre de charlatanisme.”95 Lynn Thorndike’s stated that Agrippa “was not untrue to himself inprinting . . . this work [DOP] begun in his youth.”96 It is unclear whetherhe means that De vanitate was a product of Agrippa’s later thought or apassing mood; Thorndike seems so unsure that it is easy to misread himas saying that DOP was completed in Agrippa’s youth."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION   4197Joseph Leon Blau, The Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance (NewYork: Columbia University Press, 1944; reprint, Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press,1965), 85.98Yates, Giordano Bruno, 131.99Frances Yates, “The Magic Christian” (review of Nauert), New York Review of Books,March 3, 1966, 18-20.100Van der Poel, 51-55. See Nauert (chapter 8, “The Odyssey of Agrippa’s Mind,”194-222) for an excellent survey of the theories and complexities regarding the retraction,and a discussion of the whole problem of consistency and coherence in Agrippa’s thought.Nauert’s view, to which we shall periodically return, is essentially that De vanitate andDOP are not in fundamental disagreement; at the same time, he is cautious aboutproposing a reconciliation.Joseph Leon Blau, discussing Agrippa in the context of ChristianKabbalah, suggested that “for a brief period in his life the skeptic wasuppermost in him; both before and after this period he was the credulousphilosopher of magic.”97 Frances Yates, despite her mistaken impression (probably fromThorndike) that Agrippa “had completed the work by 1510, but did notpublish it until 1533, that is several years after,” proposed a new theorywhich became quite influential. She argued that the retraction was:a safety-device of a kind frequently employed by magicians and astrologersfor whom it was useful, in case of theological disapproval, to be able to pointto statements made by themselves ‘against’ their subjects, by which,however, they usually mean that they are only against bad uses of suchknowledge, not their own good uses.98One can only assume that Yates had not read De vanitate, which is soviciously anti-clerical as to make any notion of a “safety-device” bizarre inthe extreme. This is particularly unfortunate because, in a review of thebetter-informed Charles Nauert’s Agrippa and the Crisis of RenaissanceThought, she used her theory as a springboard for critique.99The most convincing theory to date was proposed by Marc Van derPoel. He notes that in DOP ’s letter to the reader, Agrippa remarks withsome asperity that his early work has circulated in imperfect manuscripts,and argues that a complete version of the revised work will be preferable.In addition, Van der Poel points to the remark in De vanitate that “all theythat presume to divine and prophecy not in the truth, not in the virtue ofGod. . .they avaunt that they can work miracles, by Magical vanities. . .”are consigned to the fires of hell. Van der Poel interprets this as leavingroom for a legitimate and non-demonic magic, as in Marsilio Ficino orPico, as opposed to the wicked vanity condemned in De vanitate.100"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE42101Paola Zambelli, “Umanesimo magico-astrologico e raggruppamenti segreti neiplatonici della preriforma,” in Eugenio Garin et al., Umanesimo e esoterismo (Padua, 1960),146n.10; M.H.

Keefer,101 as Van der Poel notes, and is crucial to interpretationnot only of the retraction but of De vanitate and DOP as coherent partsof Agrippa’s work. But in acknowledging that the retraction is not whatit appears to be, we can go further toward understanding Agrippa’sdistinctions. As we shall see in chapters three and four below, Agrippa’sretraction leaves room for multiple forms of demonic magic, some licit,some illicit. In particular, the retraction condemns those who “avaunt thatthey can work miracles, by Magical vanities,” rather than condemning themagical practices themselves, leaving room for those who “divine andprophecy” within the truth and virtue of God.The retraction is in some ways an excellent example of the subtlety ofAgrippa’s writing at its best. De vanitate argues conclusions which seemdirectly contradictory to DOP, and this apparent disjuncture in Agrippa’sthought has occasioned numerous interpretations. The critical point hereis that Agrippa’s statements in De vanitate cannot always be taken at theirsimplest level; indeed, De vanitate and DOP can in places be read as flipsides of the same coin, one pessimistic and the other optimistic.I will argue that Agrippa is often quite careful about his verbiage. InDOP, as a rule, Agrippa uses technical terminology consistently, rarelyusing two different terms simply for stylistic variety.102 I suggest, in fact,that careful terminological consideration of DOP reveals arguments in noway inconsistent with De vanitate.

Young and S.Speed, 1658; reprint, New York: Basic Books, 1957), on page 2 of which we read thatnatural magic “is nothing else but the survey of the whole course of Nature.” See alsoWilliam Eamon, Science and the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and EarlyModern Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), 210-217 et passim.Without understanding this “threefold world” and the ways in which“every inferior is governed by its superior,” we cannot make sense of thisintroductory remark. The onus of these analytical chapters will be toclarify the purpose of the occult philosophy, so boldly stated here. For thepresent, then, let us turn to DOP I:2, “What magic is, what are the partsthereof, and how the professors thereof must be qualified.”2 The chapteris repeated almost verbatim from the Juvenile Draft I:2, and begins withthe following famous definition:Magic is a faculty of wonderful virtue, full of most high mysteries,containing the most profound contemplation of most secret things, togetherwith the nature, power, quality, substance, and virtues thereof, as also theknowledge of whole nature, and it doth instruct us concerning the differing,and agreement of things amongst themselves, whence it produceth itswonderful effects, by uniting the virtues of things through the applicationof them one to the other, and to their inferior suitable subjects, joining andknitting them together thoroughly by the powers, and virtues of the superiorbodies.3Although this is strictly speaking the definition of magic in general, it hasoften been read (with justification) as a definition of natural magic inparticular.4 The present chapter therefore explicates this single definitionthrough an analysis of DOP ’s natural magic."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE455Orthodox writers of the later sixteenth century largely moved to redefine terms suchthat all forms of magic were proscribed, whether natural or otherwise.6See, for instance, Jean Bodin, De la démonomanie des sorciers (Paris: J. de Puys, 1587[1580]); according to Caillet, the 1587 is the only complete edition: Albert Caillet, Manuelbibliographique des sciences psychiques ou occultes (Paris: Lucien Dorbon, 1912), 182. AlsoMartín Del Rio, Disquisitionum magicarum libri sex (Louvain: G. Rivii, 1599).The Natural Magic ProblemNatural magic is and must remain a fundamental problem for historiansof early modern science and intellectual history. It is clear that naturalmagic in the sixteenth century had something to do with the developmentof new approaches to and theories of nature and experiment, but beyondthis now obvious point scholars disagree continually.Much of the difficulty is that definitions of natural magic have minimalconsistency from thinker to thinker. Although a few somewhat ill-informed scholars have thought otherwise, thinkers of the late fifteenthand early sixteenth centuries generally considered this form of magic licit,if occasionally dangerous.5 Thus the definitional problem is that thecategory “natural magic” contains, for most orthodox thinkers, all theacceptable forms of magic and nothing else. In essence, “natural magic”often equates to “acceptable magic.”This stance led to a kind of backward reasoning by more radicalthinkers on both sides. For those most antagonistic to magic in all itsforms, the constant push is to contract the category—to argue that somepractice is not natural, and thus remove it simultaneously from “naturalmagic” and from legality.6 On the opposite end of the spectrum, as weshall see, many magical thinkers argue the naturalness of (for example)astrology and alchemy, thereby claiming legality through a rhetoric ofinclusion. In effect “natural” became a terminological weapon in the longbattles among thinkers about nature and its relation to humanity and thedivine.For the historian of science, such rhetorical conflict makes things atonce extremely complex and full of interest, not least because it is preciselysuch debates that led to the re-imagining of nature which was at leastimportant to, if not the crux of, the scientific revolution.Agrippa’s position in all this is peculiar and difficult, leading in part tothe general ambivalence toward him among historians of science. Unlikemost of his contemporaries, Agrippa does not use “natural” apotropaically,because he considers natural magic only one of several licit forms of magic."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO467The notion of a “scientific revolution” is itself highly debated, not only in itsdefinition but in its very existence. See, for example, David C. Lindberg and Robert S.Westman, eds. Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge UniversityPress, 1990); H. Floris Cohen's The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994) is also useful, particularly sections 3.7 (229-36) and 7.2 (494-502). Rather than avoid the term entirely, which would only necessitatefinding a substitute, I have chosen to drop the hypostasizing capitalization.8Eamon, 205; quoting Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (New York:Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1971), 49, who in turn is quoting Jean-Baptiste Thiers, Traité desSuperstitions qui regardent les Sacremens (1679; 5th ed., Paris, 1741), 2:8; cf. HeinrichKramer and Jakob Sprenger, Malleus maleficarum, 2:2.7, part of which reads: “The fourthrule is to take care that what is done bears some natural relation to the effect which isexpected; for if it does not, it is judged to be superstitious. On this account unknowncharacters and suspected names, and the images or charts of necromancers andastronomers, are altogether to be condemned as suspect” (The Malleus Maleficarum, trans.Montague Summers (New York: Dover, 1948), 191).Rather than arguing, with Ficino, that astrological talismans are licitbecause rooted in natural forces, he accepts them on their own merits asmathematical or celestial magic. Indeed, DOP goes so far as to argue thatthe moral validity of natural magic arises not from its naturalness, butfrom its deeper dependence from the celestial and divine. DOP ’s reversalof the usual defense of suspected forms of magic also entails its problem-atic relationship to the history of science, since on the surface seems thatthe work argues against precisely the separation of nature and divinityfoundational for the scientific enterprise.Of course, any reader familiar with the last few decades of historiogra-phy on the scientific revolution will recognize the problem with thepreceding argument: it is no longer possible to say glibly that the scientificrevolution depended upon— or even necessarily involved—such aseparation of nature from the divine. Our understanding of Agrippa'srelationship to the scientific revolution is conditioned by our perceptionof that revolution, a matter of constant concern for many historians.7The following analysis focuses on these problems of definition. Theprincipal distinction in early modern definitions of natural magic was thatbetween natural and demonic magic, the latter closely overlapping withthe technical term “superstition.” As defined by the Roman Inquisition,“It is superstitious to expect any effect from anything when such an effectcannot be produced by natural causes, by divine institutions, or by theordination and approval of the Church.”8 Thus superstition can be simplyignorance, as in the case of a belief about the curative properties of somesupposedly magical stone, or it can be heretical or diabolical, as in the caseof an appeal to a supernatural but not divine agency for assistance."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE47I begin with two important thinkers representing major types ofposition. First, Marsilio Ficino (1533-1599), whose definitions werefoundational for most later thinkers on the definitions problem. Second,Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), whose rather confused and confusingdefinitions show an important rhetorical approach to, or rather sidestep of,the problem of natural magic, and certainly influenced his one-timestudent Agrippa. Having examined these critical definitions and theirimplications, I turn to Agrippa’s natural magic. After a discussion of theoccult virtues and power, I return to Agrippa’s explicit definitions in bothDOP and De vanitate, and attempt to derive a provisional definition ofnatural magic.Marsilio Ficino, On LifeThe importance of Marsilio Ficino to the history of early modern magicalthought cannot be overstressed; he must surely rank along with Cusanusand Pico as one of the founding thinkers of the Renaissance occult revival.Although Frances Yates stressed primarily his translation of the Hermetica,claiming this as the inaugural moment of the “Hermetic tradition,” it ismainly to De vita libri tres [Three books on life, 1489] that we must turnfor an understanding of Ficino’s magical thought.I have noted above that Ficino’s explication of the two kinds of magichad continuing force throughout the early modern period; as we shall see,Trithemius adheres to the categorization while in large measure ignoringits substance. Agrippa, however, breaks down the entire distinction infavor of a more complex and logically consistent series. Let us begin withFicino’s original division and definitions, which I shall analyze in somedetail:[T]here are two kinds of magic. The first is practiced by those who unitethemselves to demons by a specific religious rite, and, relying on their help,often contrive portents. This, however, was thoroughly rejected when thePrince of this World was cast out.

Thistype of magic is a kind of art, and Ficino makes extensive use of it formedical purposes. . . .”10For Ficino, the underlying principle is that of movement and force,which must necessarily have some end. These ends are defined byfaculties:Nature gave to the thick bodies an appetite and tendency through whichthey would desire the lower places and gave them in addition gravity andcold as means through which they could descend to the desired place [thecenter of the world]. It gave to the subtler ones the desire for the higherplace and added lightness and warmth as means through which they wouldreach their desired ends.11Plants and animals are mixtures of elements, and as such have additionalfaculties. Plants have the faculties of nutrition and generation, animalsalso that of sensation.12 Meanwhile the celestial spheres move circularly,because “the Soul of the respective sphere constitutes the invisible center.”At the same time this motion must have an end, like other motions, andfor Ficino this end is the end of the universe: “The present state of theworld represents . . . a transitory process limited at both extremes by themoments of creation and of Last Judgment.”13As to the human soul, it too has faculties and movements, oftenexpressed as appetites: “the natural appetite of the human intellect andwill is directed toward the infinite true and good only, that is, towardGod, as its end.”14 Again,The whole attempt of our Soul is to become God.

Therefore, if there wereno obstacle each flame would fly up to that place, and when it reached thatconcavity, if it had sufficient extension, it would extend itself throughoutthat whole concavity in order to enjoy entirely what is natural to it. . . . Thegoal and end of the mind is the true and good itself: God. There it runs byan essential instinct like fire. . . .16This fundamental principle of motion or force is thus divided into twomain portions, appetite (tendency, instinct) and means or method. Undernatural circumstances, forces are applied to objects because the cause of theforce has an appetite to do so, and the object receives the force becausethere is a means by which it may do so. This essentially Aristotelianconception is expanded greatly to take into account the application ofcelestial forces upon earthly (and particularly human) objects, and it is thisexpansion that constitutes the bulk of what Ficino means by “naturalmagic.”I attach here D. P. Walker’s excellent diagram of Ficino’s natural magic(figure 1). The first point to notice is that the A and B divisions of thevarious forces (vis) point to a distinction between different sorts of force.The A forces are generally accepted, and do not necessarily have anythingto do with magic as such—as Walker puts it, “Uses of these A forces areliable to be considered magical only if planetary influences are combinedwith them, that is, if they are astrological painting, music, etc.”17 The Bforces, on the other hand, are more certainly magical, and may beconsidered illegitimate or false by various thinkers; Ficino grants the realityof all these forces, but does not universally accept their legality.The vis imaginum, or power of images, refers both to objects likepaintings and to things like Ficino’s famous talismans, which draw celestialpower by astrological affinities (e.g. a gold talisman draws solar influence)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO5018Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, 80.Figure 1: Ficino’s system of forces, from D.

See Keith Hutchison,“What Happened to Occult Qualities in the Scientific Revolution?” Isis 73 (267, 1982):233-53; reprinted in Peter Dear, ed., The Scientific Enterprise in Early Modern Europe:Readings from Isis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 86-106.in celestial magic, while the inherent natural drawing power of objects isdealt with under natural magic.The vis musices seems to function exactly the same way as the visimaginum, simply operating through a different physical sense. At thesame time, Ficino wishes to distinguish music from other arts because ofits higher, nobler power—“music hath charms” indeed!19 With respect tothe B type of musical power, which “proposes the production of effects bymeans of the mathematical or numerical correspondence between themovements, distances or positions of the heavenly bodies and theproportions of consonant intervals in music,” Walker notes quiteaccurately that in Ficino, “The B division of the vis musices remained . . .purely theoretical.”20 He recognizes, though, that Agrippa was probablythe first to discuss this “purely theoretical” musical magic in relativelyconcrete terms; he does not, however, remark on the fact that Agrippaplaced such magic squarely in the celestial magic of Book II.21The vis rerum is the most basic type of natural magic, and in a sense themost indubitably natural. The A division, elemental qualities, includespowers and forces (or virtues) which are inherent in a thing because of itselementary makeup—stones are earthy and therefore heavy, dense, anddry; animals are fiery and thus move rapidly and have warm blood. TheB division, occult qualities, includes virtues inherent in a thing because ofsome celestial influence—gold is Solar, silver Lunar, and so on. Thesequalities are “occult” because they cannot be determined by the sensesalone, but require some application of reason, be it in constructing andanalyzing experiments, or in working out the underlying rationale whichpredicts the celestial affinities of a given thing.22 This division is crucial toAgrippa’s natural magic, and we shall return to it; for the moment, let ussimply note that unlike the other three vires, all forms of vis rerum areconsidered entirely natural by both Ficino and Agrippa—in fact, the visrerum is the exemplary form of natural magic for both thinkers, although"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO5223Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, 80.Ficino in order to defend certain practices as licit stretches the analogy toother vires considerably farther than Agrippa.Vis verborum, the power of words, is critical to the performance ofmany magical acts as well as the construction of talismans and such; at thesame time, this power is particularly susceptible to accusations of demonicmagic, because words require an intelligent interpreter. “The words orletters, . . . having no one-to-one correspondence with a planet orplanetary object, can only be effective through the medium of anintelligent being who understands their significance, namely, a humanbeing, a planetary angel or a deceiving demon.” The A and B divisions ofthis force represent for Ficino a safe and a dangerous solution to theproblem—the safe solution (A) “is to confine the effects to the operator orto human patients who also see the talisman, whose signs can then beunderstood by them and become effective through their intelligences; thisexcludes effects on inanimate things, on the body, or at a distance.”23 Themore dangerous solution (B) is to undermine the assumption that wordshave “no one-to-one correspondence with a planet or planetary object” bypostulating a bridge across the arbitrary nature of the sign. Walkersuggests that Ficino strongly supports the A solution, and avoids dealingdirectly with the B, so that his talismanic magic can to some degree haveit both ways.An important corollary of this division of the vis verborum should benoted. There is an implicit assumption that human intelligences in someway differ radically from celestial ones; that is, the A type (poetry orwhatever) is here considered perfectly licit because it has a natural object(a human mind) and natural means by which to affect that object (air andthe ear or eye). At the same time, Ficino does not usually treat the humanmind as a simply material/natural object, but rather places it in the higherspheres. From this apparent inconsistency, I suspect that Ficino’sdistinction of natural/demonic does not refer to objects or subjects ofmagical acts, only to his beloved forces and means. On this reading, theonly magical acts inherently proscribed are those requiring the manifesta-tion of intelligent forces ; the difficulty (as we shall see with Trithemius) isthen how to distinguish between intelligent forces and others, except in theobvious case of an explicit demonic conjuration."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE5324Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, 76-78.25Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, 78n.1.In his analysis of Ficinian natural magic, Walker comes up with aninteresting and problematic definition, which I quote in its entirety:In the present scheme, that is, of natural magic, the planets and the operatorare not supposed to act directly on anything higher than the spirit, which isthe vehicle of the imagination. The effects produced on inanimate thingsor directly on bodies (unless by the vis rerum) are more difficult to explainwithout assuming a supernatural agent (angelic, demonic or divine) than thepurely psychological ones; the same is true of the more odd or abnormalpsychosomatic ones, for example, stigmatization or nervous diseases, asopposed to blushing or sleep. There is therefore a strong tendency for theeffects of natural magic to be confined to the purely psychological, and themore ordinary psychosomatic ones. The more miraculous effects could beexplained as natural, but only by assuming a power in the human spiritwhich was not generally admitted.24As should be clear from our examination of the four vires, the difficultywith this definition is that the vis rerum, the ideal-type of natural magic,is set to one side, and the entire focus is on the various effects on humans.In the context of Ficino this is understandable and accurate, since his maininterest is in medical magic. At the same time I argue that Ficino’scategory of “natural magic” is not entirely coherent or consistent.Everything of importance is explained by a loose analogy to vis rerum, aprivileged but under-theorized example, and furthermore certain logicallyimplied parts of the various subcategories are discarded on rather shakygrounds. As Walker indicates in his footnote to the above passage,“Natural magicians are neither consistent nor disingenuous on this point[i.e. affecting only the human spirit]; they use the A kinds of the viresimaginum & verborum, which plainly have intellectual effects.”25Johannes Trithemius’s “Natural Magic”Johannes Trithemius (1462- 1516), abbot of Sponheim, was one of themost respected humanists of his age. He reformed his abbey from adecrepit minor cloister to a renowned center of learning, with a famouslibrary of more than two thousand volumes.

We shallreturn to Steganographia (ca.1500), Trithemius’s most important text onciphers, in the context of Agrippa’s divine magic (page 189 below); for themoment I want to focus on the terminology of “natural magic.”Trithemius divides magic into Ficino’s two categories, natural anddemonic, which are again essentially cognate to the categories licit andillicit. There are no subdivisions of much importance. For instance, inthe autobiographical Nepiachus we find that there are four forms ofmagical illusion (praestigium), of which three are demonic and one natural.The first is explicit demonic conjuration, the second is implicit conjura-tion (using “words, charms, incantations, and objects”), the third is “suchdeception as those wanderers employ who are known as jugglers,” and thefourth and only licit form “pertains to natural magic, under whoseauspices marvelous effects (the causes of which those who admire them donot understand) are produced by proficients through the occult applica-tion of natural virtue.” “Regrettably,” Brann notes sardonically,“Trithemius left his readers in the dark as to how they might distinguish,in any particular case, the last-named category of illusion from its demoniclook-alikes.”27This lack of specificity is endemic to Trithemian natural magic:although his magic involved ideas and practices covering much of therange of early modern magic—Pythagorean numerology, alchemy,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE5528Brann, Trithemius and Magical Theology, 115, quoting Trithemius, Nepiachus, col.1831.29Bovillus to Germanus de Ganay (8 March 1509), in Bovillus, Liber de intellectu . . .(Paris: In aedibus Francisci de Hallewin, 1510; facsimile, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt:Friedrich Frommann Verlag [Günther Holzboog], 1970), sig. 172r; quoted in Brann,Trithemius and Magical Theology, 87-88, and see 275n.6 for further bibliographical detailson this letter.30Trithemius, Nepiachus, col. 1829; quoted in Brann, Trithemius and MagicalTheology, 91.31Trithemius, Catalogus illustrium virorum Germaniae, in Trithemius, Opera historica,quotquot hactenus reperiri potuerunt omnia, 2 parts, ed.

After a denunciation by Carolus Bovillus (Charles de Bovelles),Trithemius clearly wished to defend his occult studies and in particular thenewly-discovered steganography. Bovillus described the manuscript asfilled with:unaccustomed names of spirits (should I not rather say demons?) [which]began to terrify me. . . . [These names] are either Arabic, Hebraic, Aramaic,or Greek, yet there are few, indeed, almost no Latin ones; moreovercountless characters are used by means of which each conjuration issingularly designated.29Trithemius’s defense has three parts, scattered across his late works andespecially his long letters. First, he makes the classic move of attaching hisown name to that of an orthodox authority, in this case Albertus Magnus.We are told that Albertus was a noted expert in “natural magic, that is, thewisdom of nature, who, by reason of his marvelous knowledge of occultnatural virtues, has fallen into suspicion among the vulgar until the presentday.”30 From Trithemius’s point of view, however, if Albertus “in any wayeffected the marvels attributed to him, I am satisfied that these wereaccomplished, not by sorcery, but by hidden powers of nature which hadbeen made accessible to him.”31 In short, Trithemius draws a parallelbetween Albertus’s undeserved notoriety and his own."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO5632Trithemius, Catalogus, col. 1829; quoted in Brann, Trithemius and MagicalTheology, 94.33Trithemius, letter to Count Johannes of Westerburg, Sponheim (10 May, 1503),Epistolae, in De septem secundeis (Cologne: Apud Ioannem Birkmannum, 1567), 91-92;quoted in Brann, Trithemius and Magical Theology, 94.

Where he might well have cited Reuchlin’s and Pico’s defensesof Kabbalah, and extended this to cover the semi-Kabbalistic elements ofSteganographia, Trithemius simply asserts that he practices only “naturalmagic.” It is perhaps not surprising that he retained his unhappynotoriety.

While Trithemius and Agrippa both sought to salvagethe noble reputation of magic by using its methods to seek divinetranscendence, Agrippa avoided his teacher’s weak claim of naturalness infavor of a more sweeping restoration.35The Virtues and PowersIn DOP, as in Ficino, the bones of the natural world are the fourelements, which combine and mix to form the fundamental structuresand objects of nature. These structures are infused with virtues, whicheither arise from the elements (natural virtues) or descend from the stars(occult virtues). Thus occult virtues are hidden powers, not appreciableto the senses, such as magnetism; prime among occult virtues, however,is Life, that is the state of being alive, which is caused by the presenceof a (usually) celestial entity which vivifies nature. Parallel to thisnatural structure, the skeleton of the celestial is made up of numbers,which combine through harmony and proportion to make up thecelestial forces and powers. These powers are the source of life innature, but they also participate in the third, divine world to a greateror lesser extent. Thus a chain of vivification hangs downward fromGod, through the celestial, and into nature, just as the architecture of theuniverse is ultimately founded upon the simple elements. The linguisticand theological implications of this descending chain will be the focusof chapters three and four below; in the current discussion we shall seehow the basic structure functions in the natural sphere, the directlyexperientially accessible third of the creation.DOP ’s account of the elements and the virtues is fairly standard,compiled from orthodox and reliable sources. For example:There are four elements, and original grounds of all corporeal things, Fire,Earth, Water, Air, of which all elementated inferior bodies are compounded;not by way of heaping them up together, but by transmutation, and union;and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into elements.

This is J.F.’s translation of the second half of the chaptertitle: “De spiritu mundi quis sit et quod sit vinculum occultarum virtutum.” This is amistranslation, adding a good deal to the sense of the original, but it is also quite accurate.I translate “spiritus mundi” as World-Spirit throughout the present text; J.F. uses “Soul ofthe World” which is more poetic but somewhat confusing.and apt to be changed one into the other: even as Earth becoming dirty, andbeing dissolved, becomes Water. . . .36This account is complicated by a hierarchy of three orders: pure, com-pounded, and derivative (decomposita), in chapter I:4; we shall return tothis in a discussion of alchemy.Natural virtues, as mentioned before, are obvious and arise from theelements, while occult virtues on the other handare not from any element . . . and this virtue is a sequel of the species, andform of this or that thing; whence also it being little in quantity, is of greatefficacy; which is not granted to any elementary quality. For these virtueshaving much form, and little matter, can do very much; but an elementaryvirtue, because it hath more materiality, requires much matter for itsacting.37Much of DOP ’s theoretical argument here comes from Ficino, or at leastparallels that great magical thinker closely. Furthermore, the argument isscattered across many chapters, and rarely stated as an argument.Consequently it is simpler to analyze DOP ’s theory of virtues by contrastwith the Ficinian system which we have already discussed in detail; afterthis analysis I shall return to the question of DOP ’s argumentativetechniques.As in Ficino, there are a number of basic kinds of force, which may beexpressed elementally and sensibly as natural virtues, or spiritually andinsensibly as occult virtues. The primary medium of virtues is the World-Spirit, which “by way of [being a] medium. . . unites occult virtues to theirsubjects,”38 although other spiritual forms (the human spirit, etc.) may alsoserve this function. Although I do not find the division of vis rerum,imaginum, musices, and verborum explicitly stated, it will serve admirablyto explain DOP ’s divergence from De vita.The vis rerum (power of things) is the exemplary form of natural magic,whose A and B divisions correspond to the natural and occult virtues. InDOP, as I have suggested, this division also corresponds to a direction of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE  5939DOP I:38, 155/112.movement, rising up from the elements or descending from the stars. Thisis a critical issue for DOP: virtues act through a spiritual medium, eitherthe World-Spirit or the human fantastic spirit, which are explicitlyparalleled. Thus the vis rerum is always entirely natural in the strict sensethat the forces employed are always part of the natural world.The vis imaginum (power of images) is divided into an entirely licit Aform, the aesthetic power of visual images, and a dubious B form, theirinherent power. A golden talisman inscribed with a beautiful image ofApollo would combine the two powers—the beauty of the image gives itaesthetic power, while the golden medium gives it inherent power. Now I have invented this particular example to raise a difficult questionabout Ficino’s magic, one for which Agrippa supplies a possible answer.The talisman is clearly Solar, in that it is made of the Solar metal andinscribed with a Solar image. But does the representation of Apollo haveSolar virtue because of an inherent or an aesthetic power? To put it anotherway, which form of the vis imaginum is capable of interpreting an imageat what Panofsky called the iconographic level, where it becomes relevantthat the beautiful man in the image is Apollo?So far as I can tell, Ficino does not clearly distinguish these levels, andit is thus unclear whether the requirement of an intelligent interpretantfalls into the licit A or the questionable B category. I think Ficino doesnot want us to examine this issue closely; he simply presumes that thetalisman’s interpretant will be a human viewer, and ignores the questionof whether the celestial force attracted by the talisman will also have to beintelligent in order to be so attracted.In DOP, however, this problem is handled quite logically: the A and Bforms of vis imaginum are parts of two entirely different spheres. Chapters23 through 34 list and explain the celestial ascriptions of various naturalobjects—metals, animals, plants, stones, etc., and it is thus explicit that to“draw not only celestial, and vital, but also certain intellectual and divinegifts from above,”39 including by the B type of vis imaginum, is a centralpart of natural magic. As we shall see in the next chapter, however, the Atype is part of the celestial magic.This differentiation suggests a more general point about DOP ’s naturalmagic. The medium of natural magic is never intelligent or entirelycontrolled by an intelligence. The World-Spirit, as we have seen, is merely"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO6040DOP I:45, 171/135.an essence or medium not unlike the four elements; indeed it is the fifthessence. Similarly in mental magic, the medium is the fantastic spirit, thefantasy, which is significantly free of higher control by the reason. As wehave seen, this avoidance of the manipulation of intelligences was a typicalprinciple for the distinction between natural and demonic magic; DOP isrigidly consistent about it, not permitting the sort of blurry borderlineswhich we saw in Ficino and Trithemius.The vis musices (power of music) is not sharply distinguished from visimaginum in DOP, and the principles which apply to the latter will serveto explain the former. There are inherent and natural powers of musicalnotes which depend on their ruling celestials, and the effects of suchpowers seem to be entirely psychological, moving the passions.40 Thepassions are part of the human natural structure, connected to the rational(celestial) and intellectual (divine) by the fantasy; as such, the power toinfluence passions implies a very high form of natural magic, but does notnecessarily require the intervention of reason. Thus while the majority ofthe B division of vis musices, as well as all of the A division, falls squarelyinto celestial magic, there is some portion of the B division which isnatural, in that it depends only on the inherent occult qualities of musicaltones understood as a form of sound.Finally we come to the vis verborum (power of words). Ficinoapproaches this in much the same way as he approaches the vis imaginum,by presuming that the intelligence affected by words’ meanings is that ofa human subject (patient), thus there are no demons necessarily involved,and therefore his use of chants and hymns is entirely “natural.” We willnot be surprised to find that DOP does not accept this solution, but inpoint of fact the handling of language in the natural magic is quitecomplex, and requires some analysis.The crux of the Agrippan approach to vis verborum is the division wehave come to expect: insofar as words are treated as sound or noise, theyhave a natural power; insofar as they are intelligent language requiring arational interpreter, they are celestial. In the main, of course, language isnot treated merely as sound, in DOP or elsewhere, so the majority of thediscussions of language are in Book II, and will take up much of theanalysis in chapter three. We would expect, then, that Book I would treatlanguage in passing, as it did music. In fact, however, linguistic issues are"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE  6141These are slightly different, but the distinction is irrelevant at present; see page 68below.scattered throughout the natural magic, with the bulk of the discussion inBook I’s last few chapters. Before we can extrapolate an Agrippandefinition of natural magic, we need to understand why language is soimportant.Humans are divided into natural, celestial, and divine portions, in strictmicrocosm of the tripartite universe. According to DOP ’s version of thiscommon Neoplatonic theory, the body parts are subject to various spheres,just as gold is subject to the Sun, and also like gold they are fundamentallypart of the natural world. The mental and spiritual powers, however, areof the three spheres, not merely under their influence; thus the senses arenatural, reason celestial, and intellect divine. As was true for Ficino, thebarrier between natural and celestial is bridged by the imagination, the visimaginativa, generally called in DOP the fantasy.41Thus human minds can affect nature the same way as can the stars:through a spiritual medium such as the World-Spirit or the vis imaginati-va. So long as the part of the force or mind that causes the effect is notitself intelligent, the magic is natural, although only very slightly differenti-ated from celestial magic. For example, when passions work themselvesout upon the body, this can be called natural magic, because the passionsare close enough to nature to be themselves affected by the senses fairlydirectly. If reason motivates passions, the distinction between natural andcelestial becomes essentially nil. But if reason affects the body directly,however, this is unquestionably celestial magic. We will return to mentalmagic in this chapter.Having laid this groundwork, DOP sets forth a fairly straightforwardargument with respect to language vis-à-vis natural magic:It being showed that there is a great power in the affections of the soul,you must know moreover, that there is no less virtue in words, and thenames of things, but greatest of all in speeches, and motions, by which wechiefly differ from brutes, and are called rational. . . from that reason whichis according to the voice understood in words, and speech, which is calleddeclarative reason, by which part we do chiefly excel all other animals.

Now those words are of greater efficacythan others, which represent greater things. . . . Also those that come froma more worthy tongue, or from any of a more holy order; for these, as itwere certain signs, and representations, receive a power of celestial, andsupercelestial things. . . .42This long passage, which incidentally does not appear at all in the JuvenileDraft, is fairly clear in the present context. The soul can affect thingsnaturally so long as (1) it operates through the fantasy, and (2) it has anatural medium by which to extend from the fantasy to the target. Speechfits these two criteria, moving from an internal word through the fantasyto become an uttered word, which then acts through the natural mediumof air, controlled by the bodily speech-organs and received by the ears, andenters the hearer’s fantasy. Therefore the power of words themselves isentirely natural, albeit on the fine line with the celestial. From this passage and the subsequent chapters, however, a subtledistinction arises, which we will examine in detail in the context of BookII: the power of words is natural, but the power of meaning is not.Furthermore, the aesthetic qualities of speech are only natural insofar asthey are the vehicle of the message, but they are definitely celestial whenthey considered part of the message—if the medium is the message, thenthe medium is mathematical/celestial magic. This has the furtherimplication that written language, which partakes of the iconic nature ofimages, is necessarily more purely celestial than is spoken, and it is for thisreason that written language is discussed in the very last chapters of BookI, after the discussions of speech.Clearly we cannot continue this analysis without the information foundin Book II; the vis verborum must wait until next chapter.

We have also seen that more powerful words, i.e. thosewhich are strongly effective in both the natural and celestial spheres, tendto be those whose medium or vehicle has strong celestial qualities. If wetry to imagine a perfect word, an ideal spoken expression, it would be onewhich is meaningful in all three spheres, whose medium has physical(natural), aesthetic (celestial), and divine characteristics. DOP does notovertly hypothesize such a perfect word; I leave it to the reader to considerwhether the use of the Greek logos is simply a demonstration of “vagueerudition,” and whether it is relevant here that the original, full title of Devanitate ends, “and of the excellence of the word of God” (atque excellentiaverbi Dei).Nature and Natural MagicAt the opening of the present chapter we saw Agrippa’s basic definition ofmagic:Magic is a faculty of wonderful virtue, full of most high mysteries,containing the most profound contemplation of most secret things, togetherwith the nature, power, quality, substance, and virtues thereof, as also theknowledge of whole nature. . . .43At the very beginning of DOP, the three kinds of magic are further definedas follows:. . . [Wise men] seek after the virtues of the elementary world, through thehelp of physic, and natural philosophy in the various mixtions of naturalthings; then of the celestial world in the rays, and influences thereof,according to the rules of astrologers, and the doctrines of mathematicians,joining the celestial virtues to the former; moreover they corroborate andconfirm all these with the powers of divers intelligences, through the sacredceremonies of religion. The order and process of all these I shall endeavorto deliver in these three books: whereof the first contains natural magic, thesecond celestial, and the third ceremonial.44The distinction is clear enough: natural magic is limited to nature, i.e. thesublunary world, and does not deal with “the rays, and influences” of the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO6445De vanitate 41, 89/123.46De vanitate 42, 90-91/124-25.stars, nor with the “divers intelligences” of the supercelestial world. In thecontext of Ficino and Trithemius, however, this clear categorizationcannot go unchallenged. Although Agrippa’s general project of arestoration of magic is entirely in accord with that of his onetime master,the two magicians disagree sharply about “natural magic” and, byextension, about “nature”.In chapter 42 of De vanitate, Agrippa has another definition of naturalmagic, immediately preceded by the remark in chapter 41 that “many havedivided Magic two manner of ways, that is natural and ceremonial.”45 T h edefinition itself is in two parts, the first simply repeating that “naturalmagic is nothing else, but a singular power of natural knowledge. . . and. . . the active part of natural philosophy,” etc. The second part, separatedfrom the first by a very lengthy list of famous natural magicians fromaround the world, is worth quoting in its entirety:Natural magic then is that which, having intently beheld the forces of allnatural and celestial things, and with curious searching found out theirorder, doth in such sort publish abroad the hidden and secret powers ofnature: coupling the inferior things with the qualities of the superior, as itwere by certain enticements, to cause a natural joining of them together, andthereof oftentimes do arise marvelous wonders: not so much by art as bynature, whereunto this art doth proffer herself as a servant when she worksthese things. For the magicians, as very diligent searchers of nature,bringing the things which are prepared by nature, applying and settingactive things to passive ones, very often bring forth effects before the timeappointed by nature, and these [effects] are by the common sort accountedmiracles: whereas despite this they are but natural works, nothing elsecoming between but the foretaking of time: as if a man in the month ofMarch would cause roses to bloom. . . .46In other words, natural magic only causes effects which can and do happenby natural means; the magician encourages and delimits the effects, but thecauses are entirely within nature. Furthermore, the underlying principleof natural-magical effects is that they involve the speeding-up of time, suchas making flowers bloom out of season. Since this is simply encouragingnature to work faster than usual, “nothing else comes between,” i.e. thereare no intelligences involved in this magic at all, and so it is not demonicmagic in any way."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE65Let us conclude with a provisional definition arising from our analysesthus far: natural magic is simply magic that does not involve intelligences.This definition, of course, is essentially the same as those of Ficino andTrithemius; what sets Agrippa apart is (1) the rigidity of the category, and(2) the valuation which is applied to inclusion and exclusion.As we have seen, Ficino and Trithemius include in natural magic manyforms in which intelligences are involved; the explanations are generallyweak, depending more on the moral acceptability of any given form ofmagic to the author than they do on the internal logic of the categories.Agrippa’s natural magic, however, excludes almost everything that couldpossibly involve intelligences, and such forces as the powers of words ormusic which bridge the natural-celestial division are carefully split. Thisis not to say that Agrippa is entirely consistent, only that he is more so.His project to construct a coherent and systematic philosophy of magicrequires him to focus his attention on categorical definitions; Ficino andTrithemius really have no such project, and as such the fuzziness of theirdefinitions is a peripheral problem.The fundamental issue of natural versus other kinds of magic, ofcourse, is that of legality—such famous authorities as Albertus Magnusand Thomas Aquinas had accepted natural magic but anathematizeddemonic magic. Thinkers like Ficino and Trithemius thus focused theirdefinitions upon a moral balance: if a given magical practice is licit, it mustbe natural. As we have already seen, however, Agrippa’s project to restorethe good name of magic leads him very far from this basic problematic,and he accepts celestial/mathematical magic and divine/ceremonial magicas equally legitimate as the natural variety.If this provisional definition is fairly clear, it does not yet lay all theproblems to rest. First, we have seen that the application of the humanmind causes potential difficulties for the distinction between celestialmagic and mental forms of natural magic; is there some principle thatallows one to tell the difference with surety? Second, it has been more orless obvious from the beginning that Agrippa grants the legitimacy of non-natural magic; at the same time it is clear that such a position was wildlyiconoclastic, not to say potentially dangerous. The crucial question, then,is why does he grant this legitimacy? The fact that the logic of the systemrequires it is worth noting, but it does not fully answer the question.In order to unravel this difficulty, we need to examine more closely theposition of the magus, the practitioner, in natural magic.

At the same time, general agreement hasbeen reached that Frances Yates, however exciting to read and think about,was wrong. Although I support that conclusion in broad terms, ourexamination of DOP ’s natural magic will reveal that she was not alwayswrong, or was sometimes right in odd and surprising ways. Before movingon, then, it is worth examining the “Yates thesis.”The reign of ‘Hermes Trismegistus’ can be exactly dated. It begins inthe late fifteenth century when Ficino translates the newly discovered CorpusHermeticum. It ends in the early seventeenth century when Casaubonexposes him. Within the period of his reign the new world views, the newattitudes, the new motives which were to lead to the emergence of modernscience made their appearance.The procedures with which the Magus attempted to operate havenothing to do with genuine science. The question is, did they stimulate thewill towards genuine science and its operations?47To give her affirmative answer to this question, Yates postulated severalsteps leading to the scientific revolution, changes in worldview whichpromoted the advent of scientific thinking and thus of modern science.H. Floris Cohen summarizes her position in terms of five claims, of whichtwo are relevant for an analysis of Agrippa: (1) magical fascination withnumbers encouraged scientific mathematization; and (2) the power of anindividual human magus to dominate nature encouraged an active,experimental approach.48The former claim will concern us when we come to DOP ’s mathemati-cal magic in chapter three.

The first is linked to Man the microcosm, which inYates’s understanding makes the magician an active participant in theforces of the universe. As we have already seen, the power of the humanmind as an active force is a significant problem in Book I, and it is to thisproblem that the present section will turn; the next section focuses on theepistemology of such active participation in nature. Thus the current issueis “Man the operator,” while the next section takes up “Man the scientist.”Natural Magic and the MindThe discussion of the mind and its powers really begins in chapter 58, “Ofthe reviving of the dead, and of sleeping, and wanting victuals many yearstogether,”50 which opens with the following theoretical statement:The Arabian philosophers agree, that some men may elevate themselvesabove the powers of their body, and above their sensitive powers; and thosebeing surmounted, receive into themselves by the perfection of the heavens,and intelligences, a divine vigor. Seeing therefore that all the souls of menare perpetual, and also all the spirits obey the perfect souls; magicians thinkthat perfect men may by the powers of their soul repair their dying bodieswith other inferior souls newly separated, and inspire them again. . . .51In the next chapter but one, we read that “It happens also sometimes, thatnot only they that are asleep, but also they that are watchful do with a kindof instigation of mind, divine. . . ,” and that this is most common among"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO6852DOP I:60, 212/188.53DOP I:61, 216-19/193-94; subsequent quotations are from this chapter untilotherwise noted.melancholics.52 This is immediately followed by a lengthy chapter on theconstruction and constitution of the human body, senses, appetites, andpassions. Thus it is established that people, being made up of elementsand virtues (including life) like all other natural things, are subject tosuperior, i.e. celestial and divine influences.Chapter 61 discusses “the forming of man” in fairly standard terms.The parts of the body are made up of elemental mixtures, “subjected to theservice of the soul,” with the head assigned the noblest forms “as the towerof the whole body. . . .”53 The five external senses are related to the fourelements in hierarchical order: highest is sight, related to Fire; next hearingand Air; smell has “a middle nature betwixt the Air, and the Water;” tasteis related to Water; and lowest of all is touch, corresponding to Earth.This hierarchy is further demonstrated by range: sight works at the greatestdistance, taste and touch the shortest, although “the touch perceives bothways, for it perceives bodies nigh; and . . . by the medium of a stock orpole.”There are four interior senses, following Averroes: “common sense,”which “doth collect, and perfect all the representations which are drawnin by the outward senses.” Second is imagination, which “representsnothing,” but rather “retain[s] those representations which are received bythe former senses, and . . . present[s] them to the third faculty . . . whichis the fantasy. . . .” Fantasy is the power to judge or discern “what or whatkind of thing that is of which the representations are” and then to placethe constructed judgements into memory, the fourth interior sense.Fantasy is in a way superior to the others, “belonging to all the powersof the mind,” because it receives impressions both from below (the senses)and above (the incorporeal mind) and assigns them to their proper places.Most importantly for our purposes, it “forms all the actions of the soul,and accommodates the external to the internal, and impresses the bodywith its impression.” In other words, the fantasy acts as a bridge betweenthe natural or corporeal mind and the celestial, incorporeal mind; at thesame time, the fantasy is within nature and not entirely subordinated tothe powers of the incorporeal mind. This incorporeal mind:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE6954DOP I:62, 220/197.hath a double nature, the one, which inquireth into causes, properties, andprogress of those things which are contained in the order of nature, and iscontent in the contemplation of the truth, which is therefore called thecontemplative intellect. The other is a power of the mind, which discerningby consulting what things are to be done, and what things to be shunned iswholly taken up in consultation, and action, and is therefore called theactive intellect.There is thus a tripartite hierarchy of the powers of the mind: the externalsenses, the internal senses, and the incorporeal mind. Parallel to this, thereare three appetites:the first is natural, which is an inclination of nature into its end . . . :another is animal, which the sense follows, and it is divided into irascible,and concupiscible: the third is intellective, which is called the will. . . .Here a critical distinction is drawn. The animal appetites refer always tothings presented to the senses, and as such always deal with externalthings, “desiring nothing unless in some manner comprehended.” Thewill, on the other hand, is free, not only in the normal theological sense,but also in that it stands on the far side of the corporeal/incorporeal divide,and as such need not refer only to external things, nor to real ones. Assuch it is possible to will impossible things—“as it was in the devil,desiring himself to be equal with God”—and most importantly for ourpresent purposes, it is possible to will things that do not (yet) exist.When the will is applied to impossible or depraved ends, this leads tofour wilful passions: oblectation, which is suppression of the mind in favorof pleasure; effusion, which goes beyond oblectation such that “the wholepower of the mind . . . is melted;” “vaunting and loftiness,” i.e. arrogance,in which the will glories in some imagined good not actually accom-plished; and finally “envy, or a certain kind of pleasure or delight atanother man’s harm, without any advantage to itself.”As DOP moves on from Chapter 61 to discuss the mind moregenerally, “we find eleven passions . . . which are love, hatred; desire,horror; joy, grief; hope, despair; boldness, fear; and anger.”54 The criticalpoint about these passions is that they are linked to the body through thefantasy, as we saw above.

Upon this account they say, that a man by his affection,and habit only, may act upon another.58Several examples are adduced, such as the fact that a man bitten by a maddog becomes mad, or that “the longing of a woman with child doth actupon another’s body, when it signs the infant in the womb with the markof the thing longed for.”59This chapter ends with a “teaser,” a hint of great things to come inBook II: “Now then, if the aforementioned passions have so great a powerin the fantasy, they have certainly a greater power in the reason. . . andlastly, they have much greater power in the mind.” This remark isunexplained, except that “by this means we read that many miracles weredone by Apollonius, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Philolaus, and manyprophets, and holy men of our religion.”60Natural Magic and the “Operative” MagusOver the course of Book I, several critical points have been establishedindependently, making the conclusion of Agrippa’s section on the mindinevitable.

Third, thesevirtues can be made operable by art. Fourth, the core of the human mindis within the natural sphere, and as such subject to celestial influence.Fifth, the celestial portion of the human mind can be brought to bear toinfluence other people. Sixth, and most important, all these effects andwonders are entirely natural and normal, parts of the constitution of theworld.Human minds, at the celestial (rational) level, can thus influencenatural bodies, and in fact often cannot help doing so—falling in love,becoming angry, crying out in fear, or wincing at someone else’s discom-fort are all effects of the celestial mind on the natural body. Moraljudgment does not apply here, except in the sense that envy or lust aresinful; fear, empathy, or love have nothing to do with sin. Therefore,suggests DOP, manipulation of natural things by celestial forces is licit,natural magic.In our provisional definition of natural magic we excluded the use ofintelligences, but in light of mental magic this exclusion needs complica-tion. An act of magic has three relevant parts: the source of magical force,the medium through which it operates, and the object acted upon. Clearlythe intelligence of the source is irrelevant in DOP, for without the humanmind all mental magic would be excluded. The object acted upon seemsequally irrelevant, since natural magic can affect others’ minds andpassions. The critical issue in natural magic seems to be the medium: ifthe magic operates only through the natural World-Spirit or the equallynatural human fantasy, then the magic must ipso facto be natural.We are far from the timid pseudo-natural magic of Ficino. It isdifficult to imagine Ficino supporting this extremist mental magic, andmore difficult to imagine him citing Thomas Aquinas to make the point,as Agrippa does in chapter 67, “How man’s mind may be joined with themind, and intelligences of the celestials, and together with them impresscertain wonderful virtues upon inferior things.”61 The chapter ends witha warning, inserted in the final version:Everyone therefore that is willing to work in magic, must know the virtue,measure, order, and degree of his own soul, in the power of the universe."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO7262Nathan Sivin, Chinese Alchemy: Preliminary Studies (Cambridge, MA: HarvardUniversity Press, 1968), 27.Let us return to Yates’s notion of the “operative” magus, with which thissection began. It is now fairly clear that, as Yates suggested, the magus ofDOP stands above nature to some degree—certainly the magus doesindeed “draw power from the divine and natural order.” In particular, wehave seen that it is the human mind which stands above nature, followingthe traditional ascription of reason and intellect to a higher sphere.At the same time, although Yates’s conception of the magus is relativelyaccurate here, it is unclear what, if anything, this operative approach hasto do with a scientific one. If Agrippa theorized a magus with considerablepower, both of knowledge and of action, over nature, this does not in itselfstrengthen Yates’s claim that magic promoted science.What is missing is application. In a discussion of Chinese alchemicalthought, the chemist and historian of alchemy Nathan Sivin pointed to aproblem which is the mirror-image of that which confronts us:Our ability to grasp the import of its theories is the key to understandingboth the aims and results of Chinese alchemy. The empirical content ofalchemy has little significance unless we know what it meant to thealchemist, within what framework he understood it. If one of the elixirs ofimmortality, for instance, turns out to be more or less pure metallic arsenic,it is tempting to chalk this up as another accomplishment of Chinesescience. But are we justified in doing so if we find out that the elixir wasnot considered different in kind from, say, calomel or vermilion?62In the case of DOP and Yates’s “operative magus” theory, the situation isprecisely reversed. Yates’s argument is founded upon the notion thatempirical content is irrelevant for understanding magic vis-à-vis science.Rather than claiming, as did Sivin’s opponents, that a given empiricaldiscovery (such as metallic arsenic) is automatically an achievement for aculture’s science, Yates claims that a given theoretical stance evidences suchachievement; thus an interest in the power of numbers is ipso facto a movetoward mathematization, regardless of the empirical content of this interestin numbers, e.g. a fascination with numerology.We cannot accept either extreme. Sivin’s question (or its inverse) ispertinent: if a given theoretical stance or position is analogous to a latercrucial development in the seventeenth-century scientific revolution, it istempting to consider that stance another achievement for magical science,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE7363Yates, Giordano Bruno, 449.64Cohen, Scientific Revolution, 293.65See especially Paolo Rossi, Francis Bacon: From Magic to Science, trans.

But are we justified in doing so if we find that the theory wasnot considered different in kind from a theological position?In the next section, then, we must begin to answer these questions byfocusing on the relationship between “empirical content” and theory—inparticular, we need to focus on experimentalism, and the relationshipbetween experience and reason.Magic and Skeptical Philosophy: Experience versus ReasonIn a passage quoted above, Yates proposed the connection between magicand science which has occupied us in the previous section: The procedures with which the Magus attempted to operate have nothingto do with genuine science. The question is, did they stimulate the willtowards genuine science and its operations?63But is it in fact true that magical operations “have nothing to do withgenuine science?” Yates probably has in mind various Kabbalisticconjurations and such, but in the context of natural magic, it is verydifficult indeed to find an absolute division between scientific and magicaloperations. We have seen that “man the operator” is at the very top ofnatural magic, standing in a dominant relationship to nature. In thepresent section, I want to follow up the implications of Yates’s question byasking what “man the operator” has to do with “man the scientist,” orrather, “man the experimenter.”H. Floris Cohen notes that Yates leaves unexplored “easily the mostplausible of the various causal connection she adduced between theHermetic movement and the rise of early modern science,” i.e. thepotential connection between an activist and an experimental approach tonature.64 This connection was realized primarily in the figure of FrancisBacon, whose ideas developed at least partly in the context of earlier magicand alchemy.65 If DOP grants a dominant and operative position to themagus, can it be said that Agrippa points toward an experimentalapproach? If so, we would be on fairly firm ground in claiming for him"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO7466Yates, Giordano Bruno, 150.67Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza (Berkeley and Los Angeles:University of California Press, 1979).68Popkin, Scepticism, xiii.a significant position among the early sixteenth-century predecessors of thescientific revolution.In order to explore this possibility, it is important to take up the prob-lem of Agrippa’s skepticism, and further to relate it to his opinion ofpractices or ideas whose relationship to the scientific revolution is stronglyestablished. For the present analysis, then, I will consider, first, Agrippa’sskepticism and its epistemological implications, and second, his stance vis-à-vis alchemy, which Yates dubbed “the Hermetic science par excellence.”66I will argue that there are indeed glimmers of an experimentalism inDOP and De vanitate, but that they are considerably more tenuous thanthe “Yates thesis” might suggest.SkepticismThe important of the skeptical revival in the Renaissance has beengenerally recognized in the last few decades, particularly since thepublication of Richard Popkin’s definitive study.67 What has not alwaysbeen clearly recognized is the importance and congruence of magical andscientific thought with skepticism in its early modern form.The question of skepticism and magic is of particular importance whendealing with Agrippa, who not only wrote DOP but also that monumentof satirical skepticism, De vanitate, which so influenced Montaigne andothers. It is crucial, when reading DOP, to see that the two works notonly do not contradict one another, but actually complement each others’arguments. I shall make this case briefly at the end of the chapter, andmore deeply in the conclusion of the present work; for the moment,something needs to be said about skepticism in general, and its relation tonatural magic (and science) in particular.Pyrrhonist or Pyrrhonian skepticism originated in the Hellenisticperiod, and argued “that there was insufficient and inadequate evidence todetermine if any knowledge was possible, and hence that one ought tosuspend judgment on all questions concerning knowledge.”68 Skepticismof this sort is in no way equivalent to modern skepticism, characterized by"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE7569Popkin, Scepticism, xix-xx.70Cohen, Scientific Revolution, 199.71Popkin, Scepticism, 24-25.thoroughgoing doubt about unproven and especially nonmaterial claims.On the contrary, many Renaissance skeptics can be labeled “fideists”:Fideism covers a group of possible views, extending from (1) that ofblind faith, which denies to reason any capacity whatsoever to reach thetruth . . . , to (2) that of making faith prior to reason. This latter viewdenies to reason any complete and absolute certitude of the truth prior tothe acceptance of some proposition or propositions by faith . . . even thoughreason may play some relative or probable role in the search for, orexplanation of the truth. In these possible versions of fideism . . . knowl-edge, considered as information about the world that cannot possibly befalse, is unattainable without accepting something on faith, and . . .independent of faith sceptical doubts can be raised about any allegedknowledge claims.69The Pyrrhonists brought to bear a number of devastating arguments,particularly the unreliability of the senses, the imperfect nature of humanreason, and the logical impossibility of finding a fixed standard by whichto judge truth-claims.Popkin argued implicitly, and Cohen explicitly, that the Pyrrhonistrevival stimulated the rise of experimental science. Cohen summarizes thescientific-skeptical position as follows:The sceptics are right: It is not given to man to gain knowledge of theessence of things, and nature is not necessarily wholly transparent to ourunderstanding. But the sceptics are wrong, too, for the inescapablelimitations of human reason and sense experience do not condemn us toignorance. Rather, we can construct a science of how phenomena appear tous, with our experience serving as a guideline and the verification ofpredicted experiences as a criterion.70Popkin did not think much of Agrippa’s contribution to the revival ofskepticism, describing De vanitate as “fundamentalist anti-intellectualism,”although he granted that “it represents a facet of the revival . . . and it hadsome influence in producing further interest in sceptical thought.”71 Healso noted its influence on Montaigne and Descartes.As I shall argue periodically throughout the present work, Agrippa’sskepticism is not so much anti-intellectual as peculiarly fideist. ForAgrippa, the scientific-skeptical position is unacceptable, because it"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO76presumes the inherent value of “a science of how phenomena appear tous.” In the magical world of DOP, such a goal is entirely unworthy of thehigh estate of man.Of all the conclusions of Pyrrhonist skepticism, the most devastatingcriticism is the lack of a single absolute standard. All knowledge is relative,in that every piece of data depends on other data. This is the sameproblem which faces Eco’s “irresponsible” deconstructionists: withoutsomething solid to ground interpretation, we can make any text sayanything at all, and we are left with unlimited semiosis (see page 23above). What is required, then, is either (1) some absolute point ofreference, or (2) a strong gradation or hierarchy which, if it does not fixinterpretation solidly, at least keeps it within approximate guard-rails.Descartes, of course, sought an absolute point in the cogito; Montaigne,like Eco in a way, relied on the common sense of reasonable people. Wecould go on: Paul Ricoeur’s guard-rails are hermeneutic circles, ManfredFrank’s human subjectivity, and so on.In De vanitate, however, Agrippa chose as an absolute point of referencefaith in Christ, which left him in a bind. It is no help to have a point ofreference if that point is transcendent, because the value of the absolutepoint is its relativity to other potential knowledges, i.e. that it can be usedas a standard from which to judge data. Thus it is necessarily the objectof DOP to connect the absolutely transcendent divine with the otherobjects and structures of the universe. If this goal can be achieved, themagus, at least, is able to salvage truth from the wreckage of skepticism byreferring always to the divine. At the same time he himself attainstranscendence, for absolute knowledge of the universe as it depends fromthe divine is divine knowledge.Agrippa’s Alchemy: Part 1The “Hermetic science par excellence,” alchemy, can in general terms besaid to fit this description: it is an art by which the magus, throughmanipulation of the objects and structures of the universe, attempts toattain both transcendence and absolute or divine knowledge of theuniverse. At the same time, it is immensely difficult to define “alchemy”in a way consistent with all its various usages in the medieval and earlymodern periods, to say nothing of the alchemical practices of non-European cultures.

This is not to say that such scholarshipwishes (nowadays) necessarily to tout alchemy as science, or proto-science(á la Frazer, in a sense), but rather to understand the ways in which theorigins of certain chemical, clinical, and especially pharmacological ideasarise in the work of alchemical practitioners. Critical questions often focusupon experimental theory and method, as manifested (for instance) in analchemist’s unwillingness to accept traditional authority over his ownobservations. Such scholarship is not, so far as I can tell, particularlyinterested in definitions—it is largely irrelevant here whether a giventhinker was or was not an alchemist; what is at stake is that thinker’s ideas,particularly with respect to specific movements and developments innatural philosophy, medicine, and science.A very different approach was pioneered by Mircea Eliade in The Forgeand the Crucible, a comparative study of alchemical and metallurgicaltraditions around the world. Eliade took it as a basic assumption that“alchemy” was a complex, a pattern of thought and practice which hadparallels in numerous societies. He argued that the primary componentof this complex was a linkage between mastery of nature and mysticaltranscendence: “the alchemist takes up and perfects the work of Nature,while at the same time working to ‘make’ himself.” Ultimately, alchemywas a spiritual pursuit grounded in a “demiurgic enthusiasm”: “in takingupon himself the responsibility of changing Nature, man put himself inthe place of Time; that which would have required millennia or aeons to‘ripen’ in the depths of the earth, the metallurgist and alchemist claim tobe able to achieve in a few weeks.”"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO7873Mircea Eliade, The Forge and the Crucible: The Origins and Structures of Alchemy,trans.

It was therefore the manifestation of a magico-religiouspower which could modify the world and which, consequently, did notbelong to this world.73For Eliade’s alchemist, then, mastery over nature entailed marriage withher, and consummation of the union of natural and celestial gave birth toa divine, “perfected” being. DOP is not saturated with alchemical terminology, and as I will show,Agrippa’s relationship to that art was more than a little hesitant. In orderto make sense of the data, we need at all times to keep in mind these twoscholarly approaches to the history of alchemy, which we will seereplicated to some degree in Agrippa’s own thought.Alchemy is mentioned only four times in the entirety of DOP. Thereis a single explicit mention of alchemy in Book I, with reference to theWorld-Spirit or quinta essentia:74[T]he alchemists endeavor to separate this Spirit from gold, and silver;which being rightly separated, and extracted, if thou shalt afterward projectupon any matter of the same kind, i.e. any metal, presently will turn it intogold, or silver. And we know how to do that, and have seen it done: but wecould make no more gold, than the weight of that was, out of which weextracted the Spirit. For seeing that is an extense form, and not intense, itcannot beyond its own bounds change an imperfect body into a perfect:which I deny not, but may be done by another way.75Chapter 4 of Book II, “Of unity, and the scale thereof,” mentions the artin passing:There is one thing created of God, the subject of all wondering, whichis on Earth, or in heaven; it is actually animal, vegetable, and mineral,everywhere found, known by few, called by none by its proper name, but"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE7976DOP II:4, 256/241.77DOP III:36, 509/580: “Et Geber in Summa Alchymiae docet. . . .”78DOP III:49, 553/627; we shall return to this passage in chapter 4 (page 195 below)in the context of the Venusian frenzy, which transmutes the magus through love.79DOP I:4, 90-91/10; the complete text appears in Appendix I.covered with figures, and riddles, without which neither alchemy, nornatural magic, can attain to their complete end, or perfection.76The two remaining references are in Book III, one of which is merely areference to Geber,77 the other a remark that “heaven . . . doth thosethings, which the force of the fire cannot do by its natural quality (whichin alchemy is most known by experience). . . .”78The first passage quoted above, on gold-making, suggests that this formof alchemy, while reasonable and coherent in terms of the general structureof nature and of natural magic, is rarely if ever successful, and it can hardlybe taken as a pro-alchemical statement. The second passage, however, ismore oblique, its rhetoric suggestive of a passage in Trithemius to whichwe shall return momentarily.We have seen that the natural world rests upon the four elements ofclassical Aristotelian theory; this is complicated by a hierarchy of threeorders: pure, compounded, and derivative (decomposita), appearing in akey chapter I:4:Of the first order are the pure elements, which are neither compoundednor changed, nor admit of commixtion, but are incorruptible, and not ofwhich, but through which the virtues of all natural things are brought forthinto effect. . . .Of the second order are the elements that are compounded, changeable[multiplicia et varia], and impure, yet such as may be by art reduced to puresimplicity, whose virtue, when they are thus reduced to their simplicity,doth above all things perfect all occult operations and operations of nature:and these are the foundation of all natural magic.Of the third order are those elements, which originally and of themselvesare not elements, but are derivative [decomposita], various [varia, multipli-cia], and changeable one into the other.

The first principle is the Unity, the second the evolution ofthe monad into the binary, and the third the evolution into multiplicitythrough ternary, quaternary, and denary. The second principle is at “thecenter of natural magic,” while the third “is the consummation of thenumber of the grades and of the order through which all the philosophersof the secrets of nature and inquirers of the truth of God have pursuedtheir marvelous effects.”81 According to Brann, this third principle wasthat in which “Trithemius perceived the transformation of theoretical intooperational magic” without ever slipping from licit natural magic intoillicit demonic magic:Success in the operation, [Trithemius] insisted, is dependent on a spiritualtransformation, via series of spiritual stages from the denarium to the unity,within the soul of the operator. “Whoever has been elevated to theuncompounded and pure state of utter simplicity,” as he put this idea toWesterburg, “may be perfect in every natural science, may bring marvelousworks to pass, and may discover amazing effects.” . . . [Trithemius also putsit another way,] this time suggestive of alchemical imagery: “If a man isreduced to his own unified simplicity by a suitable cleansing throughpurifying fire, he is permitted to plumb the depths and perform all themysteries of possible knowledge.”82In DOP I:4 too, the rhetoric is suggestive of alchemy, though neither soexplicit nor so internally-directed as Trithemius’s:Let no man therefore, without these three sorts of elements, and theknowledge thereof, be confident that he is able to work anything in theoccult sciences of magic, and nature.

Second, given that where Trithemiusrefers to the purification of the operator, DOP mentions only “whosoevershall know how to reduce those of one order, into those of another,” doesthis difference imply a non-transforming alchemy, an anti-alchemicalstance, or perhaps a search for some knowledge which would itself betransforming?Recall Eliade’s idea that “the alchemist takes up and perfects the workof Nature, while at the same time working to ‘make’ himself,” thatalchemy was “the manifestation of a magico-religious power which couldmodify the world and which, consequently, did not belong to this world.”While it has been argued that medieval alchemy does not fit this model,there is little question that Renaissance alchemy indeed generally focusedupon the transmutation of human souls into spiritual gold by sympatheticor analogical connection to the transmutation of metallic elements in thecrucible.84 Trithemius, as was implied above (and as Brann makesexplicit), used stock alchemical imagery and metaphor to represent variousstages and aspects of human transcendence to the divine, and while thereis no reason to imagine that the abbot of Sponheim worked at the forgeand crucible himself,85 certainly his rhetoric fits Eliade’s mystical concep-tion of the spagyrical art.The very tenuous connection established between Agrippa’s occasionalterminology and a broader complex of mystical-alchemical transmutationis of questionable value.

Finally, and most importantly, there is simply notenough data here from which to draw a strong conclusion. Rather thancontinuing to dig in DOP for such slight hints, then, let me move to thefar larger and more direct discussion of alchemy in De vanitate.Alchemy in De vanitateThe position of alchemy in Agrippa’s works is problematic because, as isso often the case, DOP and De vanitate do not appear to agree. At thesame time, the De vanitate text is exceptionally rich and complex, whileDOP skirts around the issue to a surprising degree. In the presentdiscussion, I argue that there is no single “Agrippan” position on alchemy;the majority of the extant texts are hostile to alchemical practice, and whilethe possibility of a higher, transcendent alchemy is open, I suspect Agrippahimself had little faith in the Great Work.As mentioned in the preceding chapter (page 25 above), Agrippa seemsto have joined or formed a kind of secret society when he was a youngman, probably in the period 1507-1509. There is good reason to thinkthat the members practiced alchemy in a material sense; a letter in 1509has Agrippa setting up “our usual alchemical shop.”86 Indeed, Nauertargues that Agrippa’s early interest in practical alchemy was quiteconsiderable at this time, and not mere flimflam to attract the wealthy andfoolish: Although he doubtless counted on his alchemical work to attract interestand perhaps was not above intimating that his work was more successfulthan it really was, it is likely that Agrippa was as earnest in his efforts totransmute metals as in his search for a patron.87If it is thus clear that the young Agrippa practiced alchemy with at leastsome degree of seriousness, his late attitude toward the art is far less so.Chapter 90 of De vanitate, on alchemy, is unusually complex anddifficult. On the one hand it includes an attack on the art which isrelatively unoriginal in content but bitingly satirical and engaginglywritten. On the other hand, it appears to permit exceptional license toalchemists on the grounds that the author himself is an alchemist!

In the discourse on alchemy, thisloophole is exceptionally obvious and unsubtle:I could say moreover a great many things about this art (to which I am notentirely inimical) if I had not sworn, as is usual for those who are initiatedinto the mysteries, to keep silence.A little later, we come to the following extraordinary passage, which Ireproduce in full:In truth, it would take too long to recount all the foolish mysteries of thisart, and the vain riddles of the Green Lion, the Fugitive Hart, the FleeingEagle, the Dancing Fool, the Dragon devouring its own tail, the SwollenToad, the Crow’s Head, the black which is blacker than black, the Seal ofHermes, the Mud of Foolishness (of wisdom, I should say), and ofinnumerable similar trifles; and finally of that one single blessed thing,beside which there is no other, which may be found everywhere, thefoundation [subiecto] of the most holy Philosophers’ Stone, to wit—I havealmost idly let slip the name of the thing, whereby I should be sacrilegiousand perjured.

It is a thing, which has substance, and is notoverly Fiery, nor altogether Earthly, nor simply Watery, nor of a very sharpor very blunt quality, but in between, and light to the touch, and in a waytender, or at least not hard, not unpleasant, and really rather sweet to thetaste, agreeable to the smell, delectable to the sight, pleasant and jocund tothe hearing, beautiful90 to the imagination. I may say no more, thoughthere be things greater than these; but I deem this art, on account of thefamiliarity which I have with it, especially worthy of that honor by whichThucydides defines an honest woman, saying “she is best of whom in praiseor censure there is least talk.”In light of Eliade’s mystical alchemy, or Trithemius’s alchemical rhetoricfor that matter, the obvious reading of this passage is a mystical, transcen-dent one: we are to cast off the “trifles” of gold-making and so forth, andseek the sublime truth and wisdom of the Philosopher’s Stone.

Irony can never reallybe proven, absent some contemporary comment from the author tellingus how the passage was meant, and of course the notion of intention isitself highly problematic. Rather than fight with futility, I will simply statemy reasons for reading this passage as I do and move onward.First, Agrippa was closely tied to the humanist movement inauguratedby Petrarch which, among many other factors, promoted elegance of Latinexpression as against the medieval bastard Latin common in scholasticworks. Note also the passage cited above in which alchemical writers aredenounced for “the discordant terms which they use for things, theinelegance of their writing, and their twisted way of philosophizing.”Furthermore, note that the entirety of De vanitate cap. 90 is an exuberantrhetorical exercise, with many plays on words, intricate logic, considerableerudition, and (in my opinion) significant literary grace.91 I suggest thatthis interest in clarity and grace cannot be squared with the lengthy,somewhat ridiculous “not this but not that” rhetoric of the “Philosophers’Stone” passage.Second, the description of the Philosophers’ Stone is so vague as to bemeaningless. Alchemical texts of the sort parodied here use variousobscure terms to avoid giving their meaning directly—a marriage betweenthe White Lady and the Black King produces the Red Man, etc. Withoutknowing what these terms mean, as both chemical processes and meta-phors of spiritual transmutation, it is essentially impossible to make senseof such discussions. This sort of jargon is parodied in the sentencepreceding that of the Stone: “the Green Lion, the Fugitive Hart, . . . theMud of Foolishness (of wisdom, I should say).” The description of theStone, on the other hand, is perfectly comprehensible, and gives thesemblance of deep meaning, but could actually refer to a vast range ofobjects—given the reference to Thucydides, it is entirely possible that thisdescription is of a beloved woman."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO86Third, it is worth noting that the description given here is not preciselythat of the Philosophers’ Stone—it is a discussion of “the foundation[subiecto] of the most holy Philosopher’s Stone,” which Agrippa cannotbring himself to name. Earlier in the chapter, however, he sneered at theStone itself:So they . . . presume to forge (as they say) a certain blessed Philosophers’Stone whereby, like Midas, all bodies touched are changed into gold andsilver. Moreover they endeavor to draw a certain quintessence from thehighest inaccessible heavens, by the enormous power of which they promisenot only more riches than Croesus had, but also, by expelling old age, youthand perpetual health, and even immortality.Fourth, the humorous (if somewhat affected) style of the opening of thisdescription passage casts doubt on the seriousness of the passage itself:. . . the foundation of the most holy Philosopher’s Stone, to wit—I havealmost idly let slip the name of the thing, whereby I should be sacrilegiousand perjured; yet I will speak, by circumlocution, and more obscurely, thatnone but the sons of the art and they who have been initiated into themysteries, may understand.Last, I think the “loophole” is somewhat out of character. As we have seenbefore, and will become more apparent over the course of the presentwork, De vanitate often appears to be in conflict with DOP, but a carefulreading of the former usually reveals some logical solution by which theycan be made to agree. In the case of the discourse on alchemy, no logic isrequired—the loophole is simply a flat refusal to speak. Given the satiricaltone of De vanitate as a whole, I think we cannot take this seeming about-face terribly seriously.Magic, Experience and ReasonI have suggested several times that De vanitate does not fundamentallycontradict DOP, and that they are in many respects complementary.Although we will return to this question in chapter five, our currentpreoccupation with De vanitate and alchemy requires that we elaborateupon the problem of Agrippa’s skepticism vis-a-vis his magic.In his analysis of Agrippa’s thought, Charles G.

In De vanitate, Agrippa criticized the former on thegrounds of unreliability:Now since the senses are often deceived, certainly they can prove no test[experientia] genuine to us. Moreover since the senses can in no way reachthe intellectual [side] of nature, and [since] the inferior causes of things,from which their natures, effects, and properties or passions must bedemonstrated, are by common consensus entirely obscure to our senses, isit not certain that the way of truth via the senses is barred? wherefore also allthose deductions and sciences which are founded at their roots upon thesevery senses, all must be uncertain, erroneous, and fallacious.92According to Nauert, “in attacking the various occult arts of prognostica-tion, [Agrippa] does not deny that there may be some factual truth in theirpredictions. Rather, his favorite charge . . . is that [these arts’] defenderscan allege . . . only fortuitous experiences to uphold their claims.”93 AsAgrippa himself puts it, “. . . it is necessary that we impugn the error of allthese arts for no other reason, than this, that they clearly lack all reason. .. .” Despite all those who have supported chiromancy, “nevertheless theyall can show nothing beyond conjectures and observations ofexperience.”94 In other words, it is a sufficient criticism that the propo-nents of such arts have anecdotal data but no solid theories with which toground them. At least in De vanitate, then, it appears that Agrippa is an extreme anti-empiricist. At the same time, as we shall see shortly, Book I of DOP oftenprivileges experience over reason.Nauert proposes a reconciliation:By the time he wrote De vanitate, Agrippa argued that any higher patternsof explanation, in the occult arts or in any science, are merely arbitraryconstructs of the human mind without any objective existence.

Real but possibly erroneous sensory knowledgeand arbitrary intellectual patterns: after all has been said, these still survivethe general intellectual wreckage produced by De vanitate.95By this reading, at least, DOP does not flatly contradict De vanitate in thatthe former retains the “real but possibly erroneous sensory knowledge” andattempts to build a coherent “arbitrary intellectual pattern” out of them.Indeed, Nauert argues that, for Agrippa, “All patterns of interpretation .. . are artificial and arbitrary, the magical ones no more so than any others. So one may adopt them provisionally as long as they are useful.”96 Thusthe distinction between empirical and theoretical knowledge leads to aparallel distinction between a utilitarian approach to practical knowledge,typified by the natural magic of DOP, and an epistemological critique ofthe accessibility of truth, typified by the skepticism of De vanitate.In the context of our preceding discussions, Agrippa’s magicalskepticism would constitute a third position, simultaneously supportiveand critical of both the former’s utilitarian bracketing (to use a term fromphenomenology) of the trans-sensory, and the latter’s demand forsystematic truth. From Nauert’s point of view, Agrippa’s juggling of thesepositions tended toward “an adumbration of the idea of hypothesis and itssubjection to the test of facts, a procedure that characterizes the methodol-ogy of modern science.”97Nauert’s reading of Agrippa’s skepticism overstresses the parallelbetween Agrippa’s skepticism and scientific thought. Nevertheless hisinsight is of critical importance for understanding how it is possible forAgrippa to hold so many apparently contradictory views and defend themall with such vigor. For these various apparently irreconcilable positionsare not, as has sometimes been supposed, merely passing notions in whatNauert called “the odyssey of Agrippa’s mind.” On the contrary, he is notonly aware of the contradictions but defends them.98 Furthermore theweight of Nauert’s analysis suggests that the reconciliation of magic andskepticism might lead strongly toward the natural sciences as they wouldappear in the seventeenth century."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE89Agrippa’s Alchemy: Part 2The references to alchemy in DOP and De vanitate can be reconciled byfollowing up a variant of the experience/reason distinction, the distinctionof practice and theory. On the practical side, Agrippa attacks every aspectof the praxis of alchemy, apparently sparing nothing: this is alchemy asgold-making, confidence tricks, and the “sweet madness” by which“eventually all their possessions, merchandise, and patrimony are boiledaway, and transmuted into ash and smoke.” On the theoretical side,Agrippa attacks certain goals:So they seek to alter the species of things, and presume to forge (as theysay) a certain blessed Philosophers’ Stone whereby, like Midas, all bodiestouched are changed into gold and silver. Moreover they endeavor to drawa certain quintessence from the highest inaccessible heavens, by theenormous power of which they promise not only more riches than Croesushad, but also, by expelling old age, youth and perpetual health, and evenimmortality.We know also that “the senses are often deceived, [and] certainly they canprove no test [experientia] genuine to us.” This suggests that experientiaequals practical reality, more specifically sensibly perceptible reality.Furthermore “since the senses can in no way reach the intellectual [side]of nature, . . . the way of truth via the senses is barred.” Therefore it canbe said that natural experience, that is to say knowledge derived frompractical interaction with nature, is without certainty and even thepotential for truth.Experience, then, understood in this naturalistic sense, requires reason,meaning both theory and the celestial human ratio. Without reason in thecelestial sense, no natural thing can be perceived or understood by ahuman observer—there is no means by which a human observer mayobserve the phenomena, and no mind to interpret the data once observed.Without reason in the theoretical sense, no natural thing can beunderstood—there is no structure against which to categorize and analyzethe phenomenon. In these discussions, then, we must recognize that ratiocarries both meanings.Let us continue to follow this line. Recall that Ficino understood allforces and powers to have a necessary endpoint, a telos ; we have seennothing to suggest that Agrippa disagreed. Indeed, I would argue thatnature itself has a telos which, given the structure of the Neoplatonic"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO9099Della Porta, Natural Magick, 73-74; also quoted in Eamon, 217.cosmos, must necessarily be celestial. In other words, without the celestial,without reason, nature has no meaning, no purpose.Alchemy, like all natural magic, simply brings forth and encouragesnatural forces and processes, as for instance speeding time in the crucibleto quicken the gestation of gold from base metals. Giambattista dellaPorta expressed this particularly well:Art being as it were Nature’s Ape, even in her imitation of Nature, effectethgreater matters than Nature doth. Hence it is that a Magician beingfurnished with Art, as it were another Nature, searching thoroughly intothose works which nature doth accomplish by many secret means and closeoperations, doth work upon Nature, and partly by that which he sees, andpartly by that which he conjects and gathers from thence, takes his sundryadvantages of Nature’s instruments, and thereby either hastens or hindersher work, making things ripe before or after their natural season, and soindeed makes Nature to be his instrument.99At the same time, some alchemical goals and claims (immortality,elemental transmutation, transcendence) require powers far beyondnature. According to Aristotelian elemental theory, with which Agrippadoes not essentially disagree, natural substances cannot be transmuted intoother substances within nature—such transformation is transubstantiation,such as the wafer and wine becoming flesh and blood in the Mass.Transubstantiation cannot occur in nature, and requires the interferenceof a divine presence—a miracle. To transmute lead into gold wouldsimilarly require a miracle, though perhaps a relatively minor one; thus tocomplete the Great Work would require a miracle and so demonstrate andconsecrate the holiness of the alchemist.In order to accomplish its goals, then, alchemy must transcend thenatural—its goals and telos must be within the celestial and divine realms.In theory, such transcendence would validate the art; indeed, alchemy canonly possibly be valuable or valid insofar as it goes outside of nature,transcends nature—in the Eliadean sense alone can it be worthwhile forAgrippa. But in order so to transcend nature entirely, alchemy must castaside the imitation of nature, the entire notion of “discovering how to‘perform’ faster than Nature” as Eliade put it. In this case, it becomessomething quite other than alchemy."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE  91There remains one possibility, which takes us far outside what can bederived from Book I or De vanitate. Alchemy in a broad sense couldsurvive the “intellectual wreckage” of DOP and De vanitate if the groundsof transmutation, the crucible, were translated into the trans-natural,something rational but participating in both the natural and the divine.The obvious possibility here is the human microcosm, fundamentallyresiding in the rational but bound to the natural and reaching toward thedivine; indeed, this is exactly the Eliadean sense of alchemy absent any ofthe technical terminology or chemical practices. But once such trappingsare removed, could it not be said that language, and particularly the purelyrational written language, fits these characteristics, at least in potentia? Canwe imagine a text which would fit all these criteria? Which would itself bea microcosm?Three possibilities leap to mind, all of them I think accurate to DOP,though we cannot as yet prove this. First, of course, is the Divine Word,the logos, Christ, whose incarnation enables natural magic and skepticismto solve their difficulties by providing an entirely human, hence natural,and yet entirely transcendent, divine goal and absolute point of reference.Second, parallel to the first, is the Divine Word as Scripture, itself amicrocosm of the universe. Finally, and I think most interestingly, Deocculta philosophia itself can be read as this perfect microcosm of theuniverse and of man. In a sense, where the alchemist used a crucible toconstruct a controlled and perfect microcosm, Agrippa’s crucible wasDOP itself.ConclusionsWhat has all this gained us? We have come to see that DOP ’s naturalmagic is defined idiosyncratically, that in it the human mind stands in apeculiarly dominant and yet external relationship to nature, and thatAgrippa’s radical skepticism undercuts the entirety of the natural-magicalproject. In sum, we have learned that the natural magic of DOP isincomplete, depending from higher spheres and realities which inthemselves have no place in natural magic.DOP ’s natural magic leads up to an end which, in good skepticalfashion, hangs from an external point. As yet, we cannot confidentlyidentify that point; we have insufficient data. We know that it is in someway rooted in the mind, or rather, that it is analogous to the internal"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO92mental relations among intellect, reason, and imagination/sense, by wayof fantasy. We know further that it is something to which purelyphenomenal knowledge does not pertain—this is the basis of skepticism.Beyond this, we can only make guesses at this stage.I have already hinted at the final conclusion of this line of reasoning,as it progresses through the entirety of DOP; for the moment, I note a fewrelevant items.First, the skepticism of De vanitate is congruent with the basic outlookof DOP, which suggests that the external reference point must be divine,and specifically must relate to the Word of God—“excellentia verbi dei.”Second, we should take seriously the structure of the work, not only in itsdivision into three books parallel to three worlds, but also within eachworld; this suggests that the concluding chapters of Book I on languageand word stand in a conclusive, superior position with respect to the restof natural magic—again, “excellentia verbi dei.” Finally, we mustrecognize the fundamental limitation of a radically exterior point ofreference to ground knowledge, i.e. that it cannot be connected toanything interior to the system; in other words, the choice of a divinepoint of reference demands either a renunciative, apophatic mysticism, orsome instance of a crossing, at which the divine becomes entirely natural,or the natural divine—a third time, “excellentia verbi dei.” In sum, Isuggest that the natural magic must be read as leading up to Christ, theincarnation in nature of the Divine Word.Unfortunately, this also entails that the natural magic requires (dependsfrom) the celestial and especially the divine magic. In other words, theseclaims and questions about the natural magic cannot satisfactorily beanswered absent evidence from Book II and Book III. At the same time,we have some idea of what we expect to find in those books.In Book II, we will see an analysis of language and form; that is, alinguistic theory which enables the Incarnation to connect to the problemof interpretation, i.e. of the mind’s dominance over natural things. InBook III, we will see conclusive evidence that the status of the interpretant,the magus, is analogous to that of the Logos, producing a kind ofintellectual mysticism which is anything but negative or apophatic. Inessence, Books II and III will demonstrate what is implied by Book I, thatmagic enables the human soul of the magus to achieve an understandingof God which moves from natural voice to written language and beyond,transcending language to achieve unity with the Word."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE93100Yates, Giordano Bruno, 454.101Cohen, Scientific Revolution, 182.But before turning to these later books, let us return to ourhistoriographical problems.Science, Magic, and the Yates ThesisThe great problem with the “Hermetic” debate was that scholars did notfundamentally agree about what “science” is or was, which necessarily ledinto a historiographical cul-de-sac. Admittedly the debate is now more orless defunct, it having been agreed that the “Yates thesis” was, if notwrong, then at least exaggerated, but the more basic problem remains. Isuggest that our investigation of DOP can help clarify the issue.Yates herself drew an important distinction which strongly suggestswhat she meant by science:The basic difference between the attitude of the magician to the world andthe attitude of the scientist to the world is that the former wants to draw theworld into himself, whilst the scientist does just the opposite, he externalisesand impersonalises the world by a movement of will in an entirely oppositedirection to that described in the Hermetic writings. . . .100H. Floris Cohen points out a crucial conclusion which Yates drew fromthis distinction:[T]he persistence of Hermetic patterns of thought throughout much of the17th-century adventure in science betrays an acute awareness, among manythough not all the pioneers of the Scientific Revolution, that their newscience, however irresistible in its intellectual sweep, caused an attendant lossof insight into the endlessly complex makeup of the human personal-ity—not without consequence for man’s future handling of nature.101Although Yates’s conception of science as opposed to magic is simplistic,her argument about the relationship of scholar (scientist or magus) to“world” is worth salvaging if we add a little precision. First, as suggestedby the quotation-marks in the previous sentence, the notion of “world”cannot stand. In DOP, the three worlds are fundamentally distinct,though connected. In order to avoid category mistakes in comparingscience and magic, we must limit “the world” to the world of nature.To go further, it is just such a limitation which constitutes thedistinction I think Yates had in mind. The “externalizing” of nature Yates"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO94considered preeminently scientific sees nature as fundamentally differentfrom the metaphysical aspects of humanity (mind, spirit, soul). In thisconception, the study of nature must exorcize the effects of the scholarfrom the experiment, because such effects cannot be studied with the sametools as can nature. However philosophically problematic we may find thescientist’s goal of objectivity, it is logically necessary once a distinctionbetween physical and metaphysical is accepted. Rather than externalizingand impersonalizing nature “by an act of will,” the scientist surrenders thewill as an object of study in order to study better the workings of nature.Yates is right to contrast this conception with Hermetic doctrine, as thelatter rests so fundamentally upon the microcosm. If man is a microcosm,then the study of his metaphysical aspects is necessarily part of any analysisof nature. After all, purely natural (e.g. biological) examination of canhumanity rarely focus on those parts of human nature most critical fordistinguishing between humans and other living beings, those constitutiveof human culture such as language, religion—even magic. Thus thepreeminent object of study for the Hermeticist must be the relationshipbetween scholar and universe. If it is found that certain tools, particularlythose of the natural sciences normally conceived, cannot accurately beapplied to this fundamentally metaphysical relationship, then those toolsmust be acknowledged as inadequate to the object of study.Further precision can be applied to Yates’s formulation by recognizingthat her “internalizing” and “externalizing” are not actions but axioms: thescientist limits study in order to attain specific goals, while the magician,denying the validity of such a limitation, must examine the totality of theuniverse. It may be said that the scientist, in this conception, is requiredto believe in progress, in that he or she contributes data and conclusionsto an ever-growing mass of scientific information on the assumption thatfuture generations will synthesize it and answer large questions; this wascertainly the point of Bacon’s House of Solomon in his New Atlantis. InYates’s Hermetic conception, the magician cannot so parcel out the work,because one cannot evaluate the truth of a datum until it has been fittedinto the grand scheme, particularly since the physical senses are unreliable.I do not claim that this exegesis of Yates’s definition-by-distinctionreally solves the problem of definition, nor do I think Yates herself wouldhave been entirely happy with the conclusions I draw. I do think,however, that it goes some way toward understanding both the naturalmagic of DOP and its ambivalent relationship to the development ofmodern science."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"LOGOS AND NATURE95102Rossi, Francis Bacon.Art, Nature, and ScienceAlthough we are hardly ready for conclusions, it is perhaps valuable toassess Agrippa in light of the scientific revolution at this point. Modernhistoriography of that revolution tends to work from the general premisethat the development of modern experimental science entailed not onlya series of specific discoveries—the circulation of the blood, the heliocen-tric solar system, the calculus and Newtonian mechanics, etc.—but also anumber of crucial theoretical and methodological shifts. To evaluateAgrippa as a forerunner of the scientific revolution, then, it is necessary toview his work in the context of shifts in world-view or approach.There are two such intellectual movements which provide usefulcontext. First, of course, is the revival of skepticism. There can be littledoubt of the influence of this revival upon many major figures in thescientific revolution, Descartes and Bacon being perhaps the most obvious.It is equally indisputable that Agrippa made an influential and importantcontribution to the skeptical revival by writing De vanitate, and the factthat Descartes read this book as a young man further strengthens theconnection. At the same time, it is worth considering the fact thatAgrippa’s skepticism was violently opposed to phenomenal knowledge;indeed De vanitate’s most direct opposite might well be Bacon’s Novumorganum. In chapter five below, we will return to this question of Devanitate, skepticism, and the scientific revolution, but it is already clearthat, to the extent that his book contributed to the projects of Descartesand Bacon, Agrippa would likely have objected to such as misuse andmisreading.The work of Paolo Rossi on Francis Bacon provides a second theoreti-cal context for evaluating Agrippa’s science. Rossi argued that Baconworked towards an annulment of the classical Aristotelian distinctionbetween art and nature, which proposed a sharp and inviolable boundarybetween the two. Rossi’s claim, in short, is that Bacon’s understanding oftechnology undermined the art-nature division, in that he thought suchinventions as gunpowder or the compass could be useful for investigatingnature, both as instruments and as objects of study.102On the other hand, William Newman has recently suggested that theblurring of the art-nature division which occurs in Bacon was stronglyforeshadowed by alchemical literature. Newman’s point is that the notion"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO96103William R. Newman, “Alchemical and Baconian Views on the Art-NatureDivision,” in Allen G. Debus and Michael T.

Furthermore, Newmanpoints out, alchemical apologists have a habit of defending their art byreference to the wonderful technical accomplishments which it hasproduced, particularly gunpowder, chemical dyes, and glass. Again, heargues, the valorization of technological developments in Bacon can beseen to trace directly back to Bacon’s considerable knowledge of hisalchemical forebears.103All the points emphasized by Newman appear clearly and explicitly inAgrippa. The definitions of natural magic in both De vanitate and inDOP itself point to a notion of art as emulation of nature which, whenproperly employed, encourages nature’s operations. Similarly, the onlyportion of the De vanitate piece on alchemy which could be readapologetically discusses the alchemists’ technical accomplishments, ofwhich Agrippa provides a familiar list:I do not deny that through this art many very excellent crafts had theirbeginnings. From hence came the compositions of azure, cinnabar[cinnabrii], cinnabar [minii], purple, and what is called musical gold, andother colors. We are indebted to this art for orichalcum104 and the alloys ofall metals, their bindings and assaying, and their separations. The gun is theterrible invention of that art. Hence also came the most noble art of glass-making, of which one Theophilus has written an excellent book.105This is not to suggest that Agrippa’s work laid the groundwork forBacon’s. As Newman shows, the partly undermined division between artand nature considerably preceded not only Bacon but Agrippa as well, andthere was certainly nothing very new about Agrippa’s restatement. At thesame time Agrippa’s writings undeniably influenced later thinkers. If it isimpossible to claim that Bacon got his notions of art and nature fromAgrippa, it is also unnecessary; what is relevant is that Bacon need not havegone far afield in his reading.

When we consider these chapters as transitional, developingthe argument of DOP towards mathematical magic, certain points ariseimmediately.First, we have seen that the natural magic is at heart a magic of logos,a magic bound up with the Incarnation, with the immanent, physicalpresence of God in the world, which grounds language in the material.The mathematical or celestial magic should, logically, be the magic ofwriting, and hence of Scripture. This is confirmed by the explicit focus ofthe two transitional chapters, “Of the virtue of writing. . .” and “Of theproportion. . . of letters. . . .”1Second, writing in DOP follows on from the mind, which as we haveseen extends up to the mathematical and celestial sphere: “Now writingis the last expression of the mind, and is the number of speech and voice.. . .”2 Similarly, the extension of language into the celestial sphere is"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT993DOP I:74, 241/223: “. . . quae quidem linguae iuxta suam diversitatem etiamdiversos ac proprios receperunt scripturae characteres, suo quodam certo ordine, numeroet figura constantes, non fortuito, nec casu, nec fragili hominum arbitrio, sed divinitus sicdispositos atque formatos, quo cum coelestibus atque ipsis divinis corporibus virtutibusqueconsentiant. . . ,” chapter not in W.4Yates, Giordano Bruno, esp. chapter 8, “Renaissance Magic and Science,” pages 144-56, in which mathematics and number is seen as a “master-key” to the development ofscience from magic. In this context, it is worth considering the implications of GiordanoBruno’s fifth definition of magic: “The fifth meaning includes, in addition to [naturalmagic] . . . the use of words, chants, calculations of numbers and times, images, figures,symbols, characters, or letters. This is a form of magic which is intermediate between thenatural and the preternatural or the supernatural, and is properly called ‘mathematicalmagic’, or even more accurately ‘occult philosophy’” (emphasis mine). Bruno seems to meanthat “occult philosophy” is a broad understanding of celestial or mathematical magic,suggesting that in his opinion, book II of DOP is the key to the whole work. As we shallsee, Bruno’s reading is correct; it is unfortunate that previous scholars of Agrippa havegenerally ignored the interpretive testimony of those whom he influenced deeply. SeeGiordano Bruno, “On Magic,” in Cause, Principle and Unity, and Essays on Magic, ed. andtrans. Richard J. Blackwell and Robert de Lucca, 105-42 (Cambridge: CambridgeUniversity Press, 1998), 105.logically superior to the fallen nature of speech, for the many humanlanguages divided at Babelhave according to their diversity received divers, and proper characters ofwriting, consisting in their certain order, number, and figure, not sodisposed, and formed by hap, or chance, nor by the weak judgment of man,but from above, whereby they agree with the celestial, and divine bodies,and virtues. . . .3Writing simultaneously rests upon the prior existence of speech anddepends from the superior reality of the celestial. To understand themathematical is to approach the written, and vice versa. Book II thusexplicates the magic of writing from number through character to name.We have seen (page 66 above) that Frances Yates understood the magicof DOP to depend on an “operative” conception of the magus; what hasnot been sufficiently stressed is that this operative conception was for Yatesassociated particularly with mathematical magic. Although she incorrectlyconcluded that such a stance vis-à-vis mathematics laid the foundations forthe scientific mathematization of nature, her insight to correlate mathe-matics and operative power is of considerable value. In this chapter, then,we will consider how DOP understands the activity of magical power.4The natural magic, as we saw, develops towards its completion in theincarnation of the Word of God in Christ.

Signaculum, often translated “seal,” I have used “sigil.” I use“figure” as a general term, following DOP ’s figura.for communication between the divine and the natural apart from thespecial instance of Christ. It is not surprising, given the structure of DOP,that we find this explication of communication in Book II, midwaybetween the natural and the divine.As we move through the celestial magic, the theory of language andsignification begins to become clear. We learn the constituent parts oflanguage and how they relate, the different ways in which signs can referto objects, and the potential effects of such reference. As mentionedabove, we also see that written language is granted a privileged position inthe scheme of language, and begin to understand that privilege.Exemplum: Magic Squares and FiguresNatural magic is relatively easy to imagine, being based upon themanipulation of concrete objects—magnets, stones, animals, etc.Mathematical magic, however, hinges upon practices which correlatemathematical, geometrical, and formal abstractions with material objects;as such, the magic of Book II is quite alien to our experience. For clarity’ssake, then, let us begin with a concrete, practical example.Chapter 22 is entitled “Of the tables of the planets, their virtues, formsand what divine names, intelligences, and spirits are set over them.”5 Itcontains a series of magic squares and magical figures (signacula,characteres) with minimal explanation.6 The seven heavenly bodies, inorder from farthest to nearest, are connected to magic squares of orderthree through nine (there being no possible squares of orders one or two),giving Saturn the square of three, Jupiter that of four, and so forth up tothe Lunar square of order nine.

Ahrenshas found a system parallel to DOP ’s in the works of al-Buni (d.1225), but there is littlereason to suppose that Agrippa was familiar with this source; Nowotny has found a latefifteenth century text which does indeed present magic squares in the same order asAgrippa, but I cannot agree with him as to the fundamental importance of the work toAgrippa’s system.

There is only one possiblesquare of order three, although rotation and mirroring can produce a totalof eight mathematically equivalent variations.

When dealing with a square as largeas DOP ’s Lunar square, of order nine, the number of possibilities is solarge as to be difficult to calculate even with modern techniques.10Magic squares show certain consistencies regardless of size, and thusrules may be devised which will always produce a magic square, as opposedto all magic squares. Arabic mathematicians probably knew some of thevast number of possible rules as early as the seventh century C.E., and thethirteenth-century Byzantine mathematician Manuel Moschopoulosdescribed rules and squares which were almost certainly the chief source(directly or otherwise) for the squares in DOP.11The connection between squares of different sizes and the sequence ofheavenly bodies apparently dates at least to old Harranian culture, and wascertainly common among Arabic thinkers by about the twelfth century.The usual Arabic system moved sequentially outward from the earth, suchthat the moon was assigned the square of three, Mercury the square offour, and so forth, while the system in DOP II:22 works the oppositeway.12"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE10413Some of the complex issues relating to possible sources for Agrippa’s sigils are dealtwith by Nowotny in his 1967 facsimile edition of DOP.Construction of Demonic SigilsThe planetary and demonic marks are apparently entirely original,although the underlying notions may derive from various sources.13 AsII:22 is absent from the Juvenile Draft, and in fact is not even mentionedin the projected table of contents of the 1531 DOP, we have only the1533 DOP to guide our reading.The demonic sigils (signacula) are derived from the magic squares aswritten in Hebrew. The method is conceptually quite simple—one merelyconnects the relevant letters with straight lines—but putting it intopractice is rather more difficult. When, as often happens, a letter of thedemon’s name does not appear in the square, the constructor substitutesthe letter which is one-tenth its value in gematria numbers; thus, forexample, the letter lamed (l=30) is replaced with the letter gimel (g=3).This is based on a system known as aiq beker (rkb qy)), also called thenine chambers, most simply represented by the chart (figure 4) whichappears in DOP III:30. Gematria numbers themselves are explained inII:19.This simple numerological trick solves almost all the various difficultiesin the demonic sigils; unfortunately it is not entirely consistently applied.In two instances (Nachiel, the Intelli-gence of the Sun, and Hagiel, the Intelli-gence of Venus), a final lamed is re-placed with gimel, despite the fact thatlamed actually appears in the square,perhaps because this makes the sigil looksomewhat cleaner. In some cases, a tensdigit followed by a ones digit is repre-sented in the sigil by the single positionwhich has both letters, as with the yod-alef ()y=11) in Graphiel, the Intelligenceof Mars. This is most common in thecombination yod-alef, but there are cases when the two letters areseparated.

The argument fromsimplicity further undermines what must be the most inventive and complex solution tothe problem: E. Cazalas, “Les sceaux planétaires de C. Agrippa,” Revue de l’histoire desreligions 110 (1934), 66-82; and “Le Sceau de la Lune de C. Agrippa,” ibid. 114 (1936),93-98. Donald Tyson’s treatment of the same subject is essentially equivalent to mine onthe subject of the demonic sigils.Figure 5: Construction of the Hismael sigilwould if overlaid on the squares. With a bit of tinkering, however, onecan produce all of the sigils from the names and squares given.It may be useful to walkthrough one sample con-struction step by step. Letus consider the sigil of theDemon of Jupiter, Hismael(figure 5). The square ofJupiter contains all the num-bers from 1 to 16, and is asquare of order four. The name is spelled he-sameh.-mem-alef-lamed(l)msh), numerically equivalent to 5-60-40-1-30, totaling 136. Thesum of all the numbers from 1 to 16 is also 136, so that the name Hismael“fills up the numbers.” Now of the numbers in the name, 60, 40, and 30do not appear in the square; we thus apply the nine chambers, andtranslate them to 6 (waw w), 4 (dalet. d), and 3 (lamed l). Next we drawlines from number to number, moving 5-6-4-1-3. This processproduces the sigil given for the demon Hismael.14Planetary CharactersThe construction of the planetary characters (characteres) is considerablymore difficult, because it is difficult to see what if any rules have beenapplied. In fact, the rules are extremely consistent, followed in everyinstance but one. Their derivation hinges upon the fact that there arethousands of possible magic squares, but that only specific squares producethe demonic sigils in DOP.

While this solution is intriguing, I fail to see how it could aid a constructor. Inaddition, the chessboard method does not seem to appear in contemporary sources.Figure 6: Character ofSaturnconstruction rules which produce the magic squares given in DOP, and areessentially mnemotechnical devices for remembering how to generate thesquares.Since there is only one possible square of three,the character of Saturn is nothing more than thefigure made by connecting the numbers 1-2-3, 4-5-6, and 7-8-9 with lines. Any square of orderthree will produce the proper demonic sigils,although they may be rotated or mirrored (figure6).For numbers larger than three, constructionrules divide into two groups: those for odd-num-bered squares and those for even-numberedsquares, of which the latter group is subdivided into doubly-even (divisibleby four) and singly-even (divisible by two but not four). We can dividethe characters into parallel groups.Figure 7 shows the characters for Mars (5) and Venus (7) set into theirrespective grids with the proper magic squares. There are notable formalsimilarities: an X shape running along the diagonals; a curving hookextending up on the bottom right; curves, circles, or a more complexfigure in the three remaining triangular spaces. Taking these as distinctelements, we find a number of significant features. First, the top-left tobottom-right diagonal, plus the curving hook, connects sequential num-bers: for the character of Mars, the numbers 11 through 16; for Venus, 22through 29. Next, the various curves and figures which fill the triangularspaces connect numbers of the same factor of ten; that is, all of thenumbers in each set are tens, or forties, or less than ten, etc. The peculiartrident-cross figure at the top of the Venus character thus resolves into across and a V-shape, the one connecting forties (41, 42, 49, 48) and theother tens (16, 17, 10). The top-right to bottom-left diagonal seems to beincluded for symmetry.15 Finally, the center squares, marked by thecrossing-point of the X-shape, contain numbers equal to (n2+1)/2, i.e. themiddle of the sequence from 1 to n.16"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT10717Tannery, “Le traité de Manuel Moschopoulos,” 38-41.18One could imagine the magus remembering different points; the ‘middle number’and sequence are what I found I remembered most quickly after deriving the relationshipof the squares and the characters.Figure 7: Construction of Mars and Venus charactersThese distinctive features of the Venus and Mars characters refer to aconstruction rule found in Moschopoulos.17 For any odd-numberedsquare, place the number 1 in the square just below the center.

Let ussuppose the constructor recalls that the “middle” number falls in themiddle of the square, and that the lines have something to do withsequential numbers.18 Filling in 13 in the center of the square of orderfive, the sequence 11 through 15 fills in immediately.

One can perhaps assume thata reader who has mastered the smaller odd squares would remember the rules.20Tannery, “Le traité de Manuel Moschopoulos,” 42-49.Figure 8: Construction of character for Jupitersquare, as it incorporates the rules about wrapping bottom-to-top andright-to-left with the rule of jumping down two squares at the end of asequence.

Any doubts vanish when the constructor sees that the curves inopen quadrants connect numbers of the same tens digit (24-25-20, 12-17-18, 18-19-14).The Lunar square (order nine) presents some difficulties here.Although the method of constructing the square is the same as for theother odd squares, the character is not in any way indicative of theconstruction technique. Nowotny suggests that the four shapes merelyrepresent the astrological symbol for the moon, and I think on balancethat he must be correct, although it would be more accurate to say that thefigures are geomantic, considering that DOP II:51, on geomanticcharacters, includes a lunar character which looks almost the same as thefigures here, and which is apparently derived from the geomantic character“populus.”19 Doubly evensquares (four andeight, see figure8) are construc-ted according toentirely differentrules from oddsquares, and againthe system used in DOP is one presented by Moschopoulos.20 Quar-ter each four-by-four square with an X.

While this does indeedproduce the desired square, it requires considerable reworking for the square of eight(Mercury). The rule in Moschopoulos is very similar to that explained here, although ofcourse Moschopoulos fills in the numbers from left to right.22Although Moschopoulos did present a method for building a square of six, themethod and the finished square are nothing at all like the one in DOP. The method inDOP is in some respects a more elegant solution than that of Moschopoulos.

This type of square is in some ways the most difficult to construct, andthe solar character is a rather clever way of representing the rules graph-ically, although it would likely require a bit of experimentation for theconstructor who remembers very little; the rules for the Sun square aresimilar to those for doubly-even squares, and may well have beendeveloped by Agrippa himself.22 Once again, begin by connecting thecorners with an X, and fill in the squares so marked on the “forward” passand the remainder on the “backward” pass.

So long as the constructor recalls the necessity for some formof mirroring, determining the solution would require relatively fewexperiments.23Our analysis of the magic squares and their respective sigils andcharacters has demonstrated, at the least, that the magical figures inDOP are in no way random or haphazard. Despite his modern reputation,Agrippa was not simply an encyclopedist who collected odd bits of obscureknowledge and fantasy. On the contrary, DOP is the work at once of acareful collector and a surprisingly original redactor. From the scatteredcollection of possible rules for constructing magic squares, for example,Agrippa carefully selected those that fit a relatively continuous system, andeven devised a new rule to fit them better.If it is clear that the various magical sub-systems in DOP are nothaphazard, this suggests that there must be some continuity to the whole.That is, rather than asking whether there is a method in the madness, wemust ask what the method is, and what end it serves.Exemplum: The Practice of ImagesThe only other practical application of mathematical magic, Book II,chapter 50, “Of certain celestial observations and the practice of someimages,”24 divides readily into three parts. First, a series of images(imagines) constructed for specific purposes, both positive and negative,such as producing success for petitions, driving away animal pests, orbringing misery upon one’s enemies. The second section contains similarthough more complex images which bring true or prophetic dreams, andwhich involve the names of angels. This second series appears only in the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT11125DOP II:50, 373/404.26DOP II:50, 370-71/402.final version of DOP, where the first appeared in Book II, chapter 16 ofthe juvenile draft. Finally, the chapter ends with a short section on thetheory of images, also appearing only in the final draft.It is worth quoting the final, theoretical portion in its entirety:But know this, that such images work nothing, unless they be so vivifiedthat either a natural, or celestial, or heroical, or animastical, or demoniacal,or angelical virtue be in them, or assistant to them.But who can give a soul to an image, or make a stone to live, or metal,or wood, or wax? And who can raise out of stones children unto Abraham?Certainly this arcanum doth not enter into an artist of a stiff neck: neithercan he give those things which hath them not. Nobody hath them but hewho doth (the elements being restrained, nature being overcome, theheavens being overpowered) transcend the progress of angels, and comes tothe very Archetype itself, of which being then made a cooperator may do allthings, as we shall speak afterwards.25The Practice of ImagesThe basic theory of image-construction is simple enough:So to make anyone fortunate, we make an image in which these arefortunate, viz. the significator of the life thereof, the givers of life, the signs,and planets. Moreover let the ascendant, the middle of the heaven, and thelords thereof be fortunate: also the place of the Sun, and place of the Moon;Part of Fortune, and lord of conjunction or prevention made before theirnativity, by depressing the malignant planets. But if we will make an imageto procure misery, we must do contrariwise, and those which we place herefortunate, must there be unfortunate, by raising malignant stars.26In other words, one constructs an image at a time when the stars andplanets are in a position favorable to the desired end. Upon the image oneinscribes a series of figures which represent the planets and signs in an idealconfiguration, along with the names and perhaps the seals of anyparticularly useful and relevant demons.So for gain let there be made an image under the ascendant of the nativityof the man, or under the ascension of that place to which thou wouldstappoint the gain, with a fortunate ascendant; and thou shalt make the lordof the second house, which is in the house of substance to be joined with the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE11227DOP II:50, 371-72/402-03.

In particular, it is difficult to tell whichinstructions refer to the time when the image is to be made and which tothe characters, seals, and names to be inscribed on the image, if any. Theinstructions which appear only in the final draft are rather more specific:And let there be made an image of dreams, which being put under the headof him that sleeps, makes him dream true dreams concerning anything thathe hath formerly deliberated of: and let the figure of that be the figure of aman sleeping in the bosom of an angel, which thou shall make in the Lion[Leo] ascending, the Sun keeping the ninth house in Aries; thou shalt writeupon the breast of the man the name of the effect desired, and on the headof the angel the name of the intelligence of the Sun. Let the same image bemade in Virgo ascending, Mercury being fortunate in Aries in the ninthhouse, or Gemini ascending in Mercury being fortunate, and keeping theninth house in Aquarius; and let it be received from Saturn with a fortunateaspect, and let the name of the Spirit of Mercury be writ upon it. Let alsothe same be made in Libra ascending, Venus being received from Mercuryin Gemini in the ninth house, by writing upon it the angel of Venus. . . .28The passage continues with possible ascendants and ninth houses for eachplanetary angel.The instructions here are clear enough, and require only a fairly basicunderstanding of astrology (or a decent textbook) and an ephemerides toput into effect. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile the simplicity of theseimages’ construction with the passage quoted above, which states that onlythe true magus, having conquered nature and overtopped the heavens,could possibly construct such images.Suppose, however, that one were to try to follow the directions andconstruct one of these images.

Should"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT11329For example, it will be readily adduced from the discussions of metals in Book I thata Solar image ought to be made in gold, and so forth.30In the passage quoted above, we have “Let the same image be made in Virgoascending, Mercury being fortunate in Aries in the ninth house.” This is an error—ifVirgo is ascendant, Taurus will be in the ninth house. Similarly, with Gemini ascendant,Aquarius is in the ninth house, and so forth.31The term “midheaven” refers to the point at which the celestial meridian interceptsthe ecliptic and thus is not exactly equivalent to the point directly overhead, so that thehours from noon to two are only approximately the ninth house; actually it ought to befrom noon to 1:51'37\". It is unclear whether it is best to use solar time or sidereal time,although the issue is discussed in a rather opaque section of II:34, 350-51/371.32The calculation would be more difficult for any of the other versions of this image,because the ruling planet is not the sun; consequently an ephemerides would need to beconsulted as to when the proper planet would be in the ninth house with the desiredascendant sign. For all technical astrological information I have consulted John Filbey andPeter Filbey, The Astrologer's Companion (Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, UK:Aquarian Press, 1986); and Alan Leo, Casting the Horoscope, vol. 2 of Astrology for All(London: L. N. Fowler & Co., 1969).both sides of the image be inscribed, and indeed, should the image be flator otherwise?Having worked through both the natural and the mathematical magic,we could come up with possible answers to these questions.29 More to thepoint, however, we need to address the more important question: Whythese directions? In other words, is it possible to work out why Leoascending, with the Sun in the ninth house in Aries, combined with theintelligence of the Sun, should have the effect of producing true dreams?For the sake of clear explication, I will walk through the construction andmeanings of this single image.Constructing a Solar Image for DreamsLet us first select an appropriate time for the operation, a time when Leois ascendant and the Sun is in Aries. A sign is ascendant when it is risingon the eastern horizon, which lasts for about 30 degrees of the rotation ofthe earth, or about two hours; consequently Leo will be ascendant forabout two hours every day, at which time it is by definition in the firsthouse, placing Aries in the ninth house.30 The ninth house extends frommidheaven to 30 degrees past, approximately equivalent to the two hoursfrom noon to two o’clock.31 Leo will be ascendant every noon or so forabout one month out of every year, generally late July to late August. Sowe will plan to construct our image a little after noon in early August.32"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE11433DOP II:32, 346/365: “. . . et sicut ipse suo lumine fugat tenebras noctis. . . .”34DOP II:32, 345/365: “. . . ut non habeant Academici aliqui per quod divinamessentiam espressius monstrare possint.”35DOP II:41, 360/386: “. . . somnia vana pellere. . . .”36DOP II:36, 353/375: “Faciebant quoque leonis imaginem contra phantasmatamelancholica, hydropisim, pestem, febres et ad expellendum morbos hora Solis, primogradu faciei secundae Leonis ascendante. . . .”37DOP II:7, 263-68/254-59.38DOP II:29, 342/357: “. . . coitus vero et trinus atque sextilis aspectus sunt amicitiae.. . .

However simple they be, it matters not,provided they have a general likeness enabling them to be recognised as images of men. Ifone wish to make them works of art and if he be able to do so, nothing will prevent, andyet no good is done” (emphasis mine). Although scholarship on Steganographia 3 is rathervexed, a reading of this passage in an Agrippan context suggests that Trithemius may agreein principle with his one-time student on the aesthetic properties of images. As we saw inIn Book II, chapter 32, we learn that the sun “doth by its light driveaway all the darkness of the night,”33 and “the Platonists [Academici] havenothing to hold forth the Divine Essence more manifestly by, than [thesun].”34 Thus the sun is a useful planet “to drive away vain dreams”35 and,by inference, produce true ones.The sun rules the sign Leo, as noted in II:36, and thus magicians “madealso the image of a lion against melancholy phantasies, the dropsy, plague,fevers, and to expel diseases, at the hour of the Sun, the first degree of Leoascending. . . .”36 In addition, Leo and Aries are both of the fiery triplicity,ruled by Mars and the Sun, and associated with light, mind, intellect,sight, and related ideas, as noted in the scale of the number four.37The first and ninth houses are trine, which is to say situated 120degrees apart. In general, “a conjunction [0° apart], or a trine, or sextile[60°] aspect are of friendship,” but “all planets are afraid of the conjunc-tion of the Sun, rejoicing in the trine, and sextile aspect thereof.”38Consequently the Sun in Leo might frighten the lion, but the same planetin Aries, trine to Leo, is fortunate for the operation.Now we construct the image itself. The shape and size are notspecified, but we may infer that the image should be relatively small, andperhaps flat, so that it can easily fit under a sleeper’s pillow. On the imagewe engrave a figure, that is a picture of some kind, of a man sleeping “inthe bosom of an angel.” A quick glance at the various surviving talismanicimages suggests that this need not be elaborate, perhaps a simple line-drawing, executed to the best of the magician’s ability.39"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT115the previous chapter, Agrippa placed the aesthetic aspect of vis imaginum out of the naturalrealm; given that Trithemius does not consider any strictly demonic magic licit, thispassage may indicate his avoidance of the problem: he believes that the aesthetic power ofimages is irrelevant.

Adam McLean (Edinburgh: Magnum OpusHermetic Sourcebooks, 1982).40One might use a portion of Genesis 41, in which Joseph interprets Pharaoh’s dream.Techniques for Kabbalistic extraction of names from Scripture passages are found in DOPIII:25 et passim. See chapter 4, page 186 below.The tricky part comes when we are told to “write upon the breast of theman the name of the effect desired, and on the head of the angel the nameof the intelligence of the Sun.” The name of the effect desired mightcertainly be “imago somniorum,” image of dreams, but there are otherpossible answers, and the text is not clear on this point.The name of the “intelligence of the Sun” is more problematic. Itmight well be Nachiel (l)ykn), which we saw in the previous exemplumas the intelligence of the Sun. At the same time, it is possible that any ofthe many other Hebrew (or Hebraic-seeming) names found in otherchapters might serve. In addition, the magic squares, not mentioned here,suggest a connection between these names and the squares, such that theideal way of “writing the name” of one of those demons would be toreproduce the demon’s sigil rather than its name as such.Given the context, where this dream-image has been added only in thefinal draft of 1533, at more or less the same time as the magic squares ofII:22, I will suggest a possible (though unprovable) solution. On one sideof the image, which is a flat talisman of gold, we inscribe the character ofthe Sun; on the other side, we draw the figure in question, with the sigilof Nachiel inscribed on the angel’s head. As to the name of the effect, Icannot suggest anything specific, although it seems not unreasonable thata well-educated magus might find an apposite biblical citation and extractthe name.40The practice of images confirms our previous understanding of themagic squares and sigils, i.e. that the magical figures in DOP are notrandom or haphazard. In addition, it has become increasingly clear thatthe practical application of any system in DOP requires extensiveknowledge of all parts of the text. It is impossible to pick up the book anduse it, cookbook-fashion, to summon demons or prophetic dreams.I suggest that this difficulty of use, this “user-unfriendliness,” is adeliberate strategy.

Withoutunderstanding that theory, we cannot progress further. While we mightbe able to construct images, it is not clear why they are supposed to work;indeed, it is not clear whether they will work without our knowing why.Theories of SignificationUp to now we have seen only a few specific applications of magical theoryin celestial magic. In order to extrapolate DOP ’s more general theory ofthe power of signs, which remains largely implicit in the text, we mustexamine briefly some other theoretical approaches to these issues.DOP uses a great many sources, as we have seen before, and Book II isif anything less explicit about its references than Book I. Of the mostimportant sources, Al-Kindi’s De radiis [On rays] is not well known now,but was critical for the development of magical theories of influence, so Iwill summarize the text at some length.

He died in Baghdadaround 873 (A.H. 260) at the age of eighty or so.43The original Arabic of De radiis is not extant. The Latin translation,which dates from the twelfth century, is probably at least similar to theArabic original, but it is possible that the work is entirely spurious. In itsLatin form, however, the work was well known to such figures as RogerBacon and Albertus Magnus, and is referred to (at least implicitly) byFicino, Pico, Zorzi, and Agrippa himself.44De radiis is an entirely theoretical work, dealing with abstract principlesof magic. In brief, it argues that all things are interconnected by “rays,”like invisible beams of light, which can only be perceived by their effects.Every celestial object projects these rays, which then strike every otherobject in the “machine of the world” and produce effects dependent uponthe star which emits them, the location of the receiving object, the strengthof correspondence between emitter and receptor, and the other rays whichstrike the same receptor. For example, Mars emits rays which (amongother things) promote warlike or aggressive qualities; these rays strike allobjects, which thus incline more or less strongly to such qualities. Anobject’s location may place it directly under the influence of Mars, suchthat the rays strike quite directly; if the location places the object at agreater or lesser angle of incidence to the rays, they strike with more or lesseffect. Some objects, by virtue of form, substance, accidents, and so forth,are particularly receptive to Martian rays, as for example objects made ofiron, brass, or sulphur, or warlike animals and people. These receptors aremore strongly affected by Martian rays than those which fall under otherstars, as silver under the Moon, or melancholic people under Saturn.Every object of the material world also produces rays, which are in asense refractions or aggregates of the celestial rays. Thus a piece of silvertends mainly to project lunar rays, but it will also project Martian rays inproportion to the position of Mars in the sky and the other characteristicsof the silver object (such as being inscribed with a figure of Mars).What we think of as sensible perception is our reception of the totalityof all these rays.

Indeed, what I really perceive isnot the candle at all, but the image which these rays induce in my mind.Since humans are a microcosm of the universe, the image so producedis similarly microcosmic; it is in every way a perfect replica, and an entirelyreal (but not at all material) object. If I grasp this image firmly in mymind, I can affect it by force of will, and produce a parallel effect upon thephysical object which projected the image. Thus I can light the candlesimply by adding to the mental image the additional characteristics andqualities of a candle-flame, such as heat, light, smoky smell, etc.The only difficulties in lighting a candle in this fashion are (1) therevised image must be nearly perfect, and (2) the magician must will it tohappen very strongly. Al-Kindi is not absolutely clear on how to go aboutthis; apparently mental training of some sort is necessary, and the magiciangenerally supplements the magical action with additional acts, such asspeaking words, playing music, making gestures, and so forth. Theseadditional acts produce their own rays, and if properly chosen, add to theforce of the magician’s will, ensuring that the candle does indeed light.Physical images, discussed near the end of the work, are supplementaryobjects acting in much the same ways as supplementary actions. Themagician constructs an image of or related to the object which heultimately wishes to affect, or to the effect which he wishes to produce.This image should be connected to the object by strong resemblances andcorrelations, i.e. by a great many powerful rays. Thus the image should beconstructed at an astrologically appropriate time and place, of anappropriate material, in an appropriate shape, inscribed with appropriatefigures, words, etc. The construction of the image, in fact, is described inthe same manner as the fundamental magical procedure of will, in thatimage-construction depends on an act of will, with the magician stronglydesiring or willing that the image act in the desired fashion, as an idealreflection of the object or effect in question.Before moving on, a few points should be noted. First, it is not entirelyclear how the supplemental actions support the central act of will. GivenDOP ’s theory of the mind and the fantasy discussed in the previouschapter, I think these supplementary actions are supposed to function intwo ways: (1) they produce rays which tend to encourage the desired effectupon the object, for example reflecting solar rays to encourage fire on acandle; and (2) these same rays produce similar effects on the mental image"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  11945De radiis, 100-118.46On the linguistic status of writing, see the many stimulating essays in Josef Vachek,Written Language Revisited (Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing,1989), which are particularly useful as critical summaries of linguistic work; for a moreanthropological approach, see Jack Goody, The Interface Between the Written and the Oral(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987).47Roman Jakobson, “Retrospect,” in Selected Writings, Volume I (The Hague, 1962),653ff; quoted in Vachek, “On the Linguistic Status of Written Utterances,” in WrittenLanguage, 18.of the object, acting through the fantasy to bolster the magician’s will andimprove the clarity or perfection of the altered image.Second, al-Kindi makes clear that rays are bi-directional, although theyseem to have a dominant direction. In effect, they establish conduits forpower between any two objects, and a magician can send power fromreceptor to emitter. The importance of supplemental actions seems toimply that this is more difficult than simply encouraging the effect ofalready-present rays. For example, a lead talisman of Saturn is connectedboth with Saturn and with the person who wears it. Because the raysmove downward from the celestial sphere to the talisman and thence tothe wearer, it is easier to strengthen the effect of the talisman on the wearerthan it is to use the person to affect the talisman, and it is easier to streng-then the effect of Saturn on the talisman than it is to use the talisman toaffect Saturn itself (which last would appear, in De radiis, to be nearlyimpossible, although perhaps not absolutely so).Third, although al-Kindi stresses the importance of words as the mostcritical form of supplementary magical actions, devoting more than a thirdof De radiis to “the power of words,” 45 very little of his language-theoryappears to have been picked up in DOP. We will see later that there aresome interesting intersections, but DOP ’s theory of language breaks quitesharply from Al-Kindi.The Semiotics of WritingFor the most part, semioticians and linguists have denigrated writing asirrelevant to the “universals” of language.46 For Roman Jakobson, “topreach the mere coexistence of the phonological and graphic systems whiledenying the primary, fundamental nature of the former would be amisleading distortion of the actual linguistic stratification,”47 and hestresses that “in the relation between graphic and phonological entities, the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE12048Roman Jakobson, “Linguistics in Relation to Other Sciences,” On Language, ed.Linda R.

Hockett argues that “the channel for all linguisticcommunication is vocal-auditory,” which necessarily “excludes writtenlanguage from the category ‘human language.’”49On the other hand, the evidence adduced for this denigration ofwritten language is almost immediately suspect. Most of the argumentshave been speciously historical, even evolutionary: it is the fact that writingemerges historically later than speech which denies writing the status of alanguage universal.50 As Jacques Derrida and others have noted, thecriticism of written language is at heart a moral one. Saussure’s dictumthat “Writing veils the appearance of language; it is not a guise forlanguage but a disguise,” his claim that “the spoken word is so intimatelybound to its written image that the latter manages to usurp the mainrole,”51 make clear his demonization of writing, which he attempts to veilwith false historicism.Nevertheless, Josef Vachek and a few other linguists have studiedwriting as a distinct form of language. Their conclusions are surprising:some argue that written language constitutes an almost entirely separatemode of language from speech, having its own langue and parole; to usefunctionalist terminology, there are both spoken and written norms. In thecontext of these norms (or langues), Fred Householder has even made thesuggestion that in logical terms, written language is prior to spoken.52In its barest form, the argument is that, in communities which have awritten as well as a spoken norm of language, the written rapidly attainsconsiderable social status—literacy becomes a marker of the elite. Whenspeech is used in such a community, Householder argues, the listenerrefers to the written norm to ensure clear understanding, a referentialprocess unnecessary with written text. For example, “eye” and “I” arepronounced identically, requiring the listener to refer to a broader norm"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT12153Incidentally, this suggests that différance should be pronounced like the English“difference” when speaking English, limiting the distinction to the textual. The usualpronunciation, like the French différence, obscures a large part of the value of theneologism, thereby transforming it into merely another piece of mystifying jargon.for comprehension; in a written text, on the other hand, there is nopossibility of misunderstanding the one for the other. Jacques Derrida hasmade this point with his neologism différance, pronounced the same asdifférence but which, in its written form, suggests a participial, active senseof both differing and deferring.53In some systems, such as Chinese, there is no direct phonetic compo-nent of the written characters; despite this, the referential process whichHouseholder describes occurs in Chinese as well. The most commonexample is names: when a speaker gives a name, each syllable is commonlyrepeated with a two- or three-character phrase which identifies thecharacter’s meaning. This would translate something like, “Householder.House, as in dwelling. Holder, as in one who owns.” Thus the spokennorm can be said to depend upon the written norm.Because of the lack of a fixed order of graphemes, Chinese charactersare not strongly sequenced as are the letters of the alphabet. Despite this,they can be looked up in a dictionary. In the most common system, eachcharacter is broken down visually, such that a portion can be read as aspecial sub-character, or radical. The radicals have a more or less setsequence, based upon the number of brush-strokes necessary to writethem. Having found the radical in the index, one consults the sub-sectionof characters with the same number of additional brush-strokes as thecharacter sought. This provides a manageable list of characters.In Chinese, then, graphemes are commonly categorized by the way theyare produced, with no reference whatever to a phonetic scheme. Beyondthis, it is important to note that the relation between a Chinese characterand its meaning is utterly arbitrary, except in a very few cases of extremelyancient characters which derive from pictographs of the things represented.Reading Chinese characters, then, depends on a number of systems(stroke-order, radicals, rote memorization, ideographic representation)which have no connection to the spoken language, as powerfully evidencedby the near-universality of the Chinese written language as compared tothe many mutually incomprehensible spoken dialects.Vachek notes two distinctive features of writing which are of particularrelevance to an analysis of magical figures: first, the difference in temporal"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE12254Michel Foucault, The Order of Things (New York: Vintage Books, 1990), passim.control of the utterance; second, the sequential and even ordinal nature ofwritten characters within many writing systems. To the latter I wouldappend the visual divisibility of the grapheme which as we have seen cansupplement or substitute for sequentiality.(1) Temporal control: A listener is jailed by the speaker, locked into thespeaker’s delivery. The speaker controls the temporal extension of theutterance, and the listener cannot skip back and forth. In writtenlanguage, however, it is the reader who holds the whip hand, providing ofcourse that this reader has already attained sufficient mastery of thegraphic system. In terms of ideology and control, an orator dominates thesituation, in that the listener has very limited options: he may surrendercontrol and wait for an opportunity to speak; he may refuse to listen andthereby surrender his opportunity to respond; or he may attempt to wrestcontrol from the speaker by interrupting, heckling, or even respondingwhen he has not actually listened.The reader’s control of the situation is far greater: she may read the textin the order prescribed by the norm of the system (for example left toright, word by word, and on sequentially through the work); she mayglance through rapidly, attempting only to get the gist of the text; she maydip into the work, reading portions which interest her whenever shechooses; she may even read transgressively, refusing to follow the norm(reading an English book from back to front or right to left, for example).On the other hand, she may not respond directly to the writer, as can alistener to a speaker, although she may write marginalia or even a lengthytext in response: the conversational model does not hold in writing.(2) Ordering: Many written systems order graphemes in a fixedsequence: abc, alpha-beta-gamma, etc. In some instances, this sequencemay serve an ordering function, acting as an assistant to readers. Indexesare commonly ordered alphabetically, although as Michel Foucault hasnoted there is no “natural” reason to do so.54 In gematria, as we have seen,the sequence of letters is used to denote numbers: alef=1, bet=2, etc.(3) Divisibility: Chinese characters and their systematization may serveas an example of the visual divisibility of written signs: characters breakdown into at least two portions for purposes of a dictionary index.Although most alphabetic systems do not fit this model, the phenomenonof spelling can in a sense serve the same function.

One can, of course, subdivide spokenwords into syllables and pronounce them sequentially or in a randomorder, but the parallel is weak, as well as extremely rare.One apparent counter-example would be Brahminical training inancient Sanskrit texts. As is well known, these “texts” are memorized andpassed down orally, keeping intact not only every word of the corpus butalso every syllabic emphasis and accent. A famous test of a Brahmin’sknowledge requires him to recite a portion syllable by syllable backwards,or even in alternating syllables—first, last, second, second-to-last, etc.,until the recitation converges in the middle. It would seem, on the face ofit, that the survival of the Vedic corpus attests to the existence andimportance of the arbitrary divisibility of spoken language, even if thereare few known examples.At the same time, it has been argued that the existence of suchmemorization, known as Lengthy Verbatim Recall in psycholinguistics, isprecisely evidence of a written norm. Parry’s and Lord’s famous works onepic recitations suggest that in non-literary cultures, the concept of rotememorization is absent. Similarly, it seems that the origins of theBrahminic memorization tradition are precisely contemporary with theadvent of a written system in ancient South Asia. Indeed, one might arguethat this priestly tradition defends against writing by constructing a kindof mental or mnemotechnical writing. Like the ars memorativa, such asystem depends on the user’s ability to situate syllables or words inimagined space, rather than in time as is usual for speech.55Thus if writing is considered on its own terms, rather than as aderivative of speech, it has (at least) the following characteristics: (1)interpretive control by the recipient rather than the producer; (2) arbitrary"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE12456Jonathan Z.

In many cases, thewritten signs are also sequenced according to an arbitrarily chosen system.Writing, according to this definition, includes not only all the systemsnormally so called, but also the majority of mnemotechnical systems.Most interestingly for our purposes, it also includes a great manydivinatory systems, even among communities normally considered non-literate. For example, the Yoruba divination system (Ifa) requires divinersto construct a four-by-two grid, where each of the eight elements isdetermined by the random fall of palm nuts. This process produces oneof 256 figures, which are then interpreted. Jonathan Z. Smith argues thatsuch techniques produce texts read according to “canons” of interpreta-tion.56 Although Smith’s focus is on interpretive canons, the literaryconnotations of the term “canon” apply equally to the figures or textsproduced by such divinations.

Of all the chapters discussing a single number, this is the most detailed andcomprehensive. At the same time, it is little more than an extensive list of important thingswhich come in sevens. The importance of these chapters for the current argument issimply that the number and the things numbered are translatable; that is, seven can standin for the planets, and all septenaries are innately parallel.59DOP II:2, 252/237: “Rursus omnia quae sunt atque fiunt certis numero, omnisquemotus et actio et omnia quaecunque tempori et motui subiecta sunt; concentus etiam atquevoces per numeros eorumque proportionem vim habent atque constant proportionesque,ex numeris ortae, per lineas et puncta constituunt characteres et figuras. <Et hi sunt propriioperibus magicis, medio existente inter utrosque appropriato per declinationem adextrema, ut in usu literarum.” Note that the passage marked with angle braces has beeninserted for the 1533 edition, and does not appear in W; the original passage appeared inorder to clarify this practice, it is simplest to divide DOP ’s approach tolanguage into two portions: elementary units and theories of signification.Number and HarmonyAs was made clear in the previous chapter, Book I argues that nature andlogos rests upon an elemental foundation. Similarly, Book II argues thatcelestial language rests upon a numerical foundation.Numbers in DOP do not merely count, but represent. Because thereare seven planetary bodies, for example, the number seven can representthe planets.58 This is equally true with the ordinal aspect of num-bers—since Saturn resides in the third sphere (counting downwards fromheaven), the number three can represent Saturn. The argument is implicitin the parallel between the natural elements in Book I and the numbers inBook II. In nature, for instance, fire is linked to heat by a two-waysemiosis, such that heat implies fire and fire implies heat. Similarly,numbers imply what they count or order, and vice-versa.Like the elements, also, numbers can be joined together to constructcomplex objects or signs which similarly act by a referential processthrough the more basic numbers.Again, all things that are, and are made, subsist by, and receive theirvirtue from numbers. For time consists of number, and all motion, andaction, and all things which are subject to time, and motion. Harmony also,and voices have their power by, and consist of numbers, and their propor-tions, and the proportions arising from numbers, do by lines, and points,make characters, and figures: <and these are proper to magical operations,the middle which is betwixt both being appropriated by declining to theextremes, as in the use of letters.>59"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE126W II:17.

Probably because of this misreading, he alsoconfuses much of the latter half of the sentence, which I have re-translated from the Latin.Note also that the phrase “and whatever characters” has been inserted only in the 1533edition, and is here punctuated as an independent clause. The original sentence reads:“Similiter et figurae de quibus diximus <atque characteres quicunque> concipiunt virtutesfigurarum coelestium, quatenus dominantibus illis opportune fuerint rebus impressae autrite fabricatae, tanquam conspiret figura ad consimilem figuram atque exigat.”As in Jakobson’s theory that written language signifies by reference tospoken language, these complex signs signify by reference to numbers. Inaddition, the interaction of numbers in such signs is determined byrelationships of harmony and proportion, which parallel the chemicalinteractions of the elements. These harmonies and proportions aregeometrical and mathematical, but they are also concretely realized in thecelestial world in such structures as the proportions of the human body (asimago Dei) and of the stars. Even more complex are semes which derivefrom human proportions, celestial positions (e.g. constellations), or puregeometry. Such complicated signs thus signify by a long chain ofreference, from human proportion (for example), to basic harmony andproportion, and thus to simple formal numbers.Figure and ImageThis is to be observed, whatsoever wonderful thing figures work whenwe write them in papers, plates, or images, they do not do it but by thevirtue acquired from sublimer figures, by a certain affection which naturalaptitude or resemblance procures, in as much as they are exactly configuredto them, as from an opposite wall the echo is caused, and in a hollow glassthe collection of the solary rays, which afterward reflecting upon an oppositebody, either wood, or any combustible thing, doth forthwith burn it: or asan harp causeth a resounding in another harp, which is no otherwise butbecause a suitable and like figure is set before it . . . Similarly the figures ofwhich we have spoken, and whatever characters, conceive the virtues of thecelestial figures according as they have been opportunely impressed uponthings or ritually constructed for the ruling figures, such that one figure isof affinity with, and doth express the other.60This long paragraph is one of the very few explicit statements about thetheory of figures in DOP, and requires our attention.

Theanalogy proceeds stepwise, with visible solar rays in the case of the mirror,and invisible rays (or sound-waves) in that of the harp. Adding these twotogether produces the theory of celestial images.When the construction of a magical image is done correctly, “one figureis of affinity with, and doth express the other” from which it is made.This is a crucial phrase, and it is typical of DOP that it should be hiddenin the middle of a largely unremarkable chapter. There is a distinctionhere: on the one hand, the constructed figure is of affinity with, i.e. has anoccult connection to, the celestial figure from which it is derived; on theother, the constructed figure expresses the celestial one. In a linguistic orsemiotic context, the implication is that the constructed figure refers to thecelestial in two different ways, by resemblance (iconicity) and by conven-tion (symbolism). That is, the constructed figure is like the word “cat,”expressing the notion cat within a given (arbitrary) symbol system, and itis simultaneously an image, depicting the animal by an iconic affinity. Both types of reference here also have an indexical power, to which weshall return. For the current discussion of figures, however, there are threeimportant points for DOP ’s system. First, resemblance or affinity is notequivalent to expressive meaning. Second, these two modes of referencecan be added, that is, both can be present in any given sign. Third, theray-connections between natural and celestial objects (mirror and sun) arenot dissimilar to those between natural objects (two harps), except that, aswith al-Kindi, the dominant direction of celestial rays is downward (sunaffects mirror), where natural rays seem entirely bi-directional (any harpaffects any harp).Character and HieroglyphDOP does not explicitly discuss hieroglyphs in much detail, which israther a pity, as the issue was of considerable importance in magical and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE12862DOP III:2, 404/443.63DOP II:23, 320/330.linguistic speculations during the Renaissance. The most extended remarkon the subject is as follows:Therefore the religious volumes of the Egyptians and those belonging tothe secrets of their ceremonies, were made of consecrated paper; in thesethey did write down letters which might not be easily known, which theycall holy. Macrobius, Marcellinus and others say, they were called hiero-glyphs, lest perchance the writings of this kind should be known to theprofane, which also Apuleius testifies in these words, saying, “The sacrificebeing ended, from a secret retired closet he bringeth forth certain booksnoted with obscure letters, affording compendious words of the conceivedspeech, partly by the figures of beasts of this kind, partly by figures full ofknots, and crooked in manner of a wheel and set thick, twining about likevine tendrils, the reading thereby being defended from the curiosity of theprofane.”62A similar (though shorter) remark appears in III:29, and in II:23 there isa passing remark on the ankh, “reckoned by the Egyptian priests, from thebeginning of religion amongst sacred letters, signifying amongst themallegorically the life of future salvation.”63DOP here accepts the two stock Renaissance interpretations ofhieroglyphs. First, they were secret, priestly writing, as originally suggestedby Plutarch and Herodotus; second, they relate allegorically to theirmeanings, a notion strongly confirmed by Horapollo.Of course, neither is actually true of Egyptian hieroglyphs, but it mustbe recalled that the Rosetta stone was not found until 1799, and Renais-sance thinkers were extremely unlikely actually to decipher the ancientEgyptian language in any case. What is of greater interest and importancehere is the magical and allegorical conception of hieroglyphs, and how thatfits into a notion of written language more generally.This twofold theory, based on secrecy and allegory, depends on apeculiar notion of interpretation. The idea is that a hieroglyph is perfectlytransparent and extremely dense. That is, a single sign may represent aquite complex idea. Horapollo gives the famous example of the ouroboros:2. THE UNIVERSE. When they wish to depict the Universe, theydraw a serpent devouring its own tail, marked with variegated scales. By thescales they suggest the stars in the heavens.

But the factthat it uses its own body for food signifies that whatever things are generatedin the world by Divine Providence are received back into it by [a gradualprocess of] diminution.64In theory, a priest, immensely well educated about all things sacred, wouldsimply look at this hieroglyph and understand at once the complex notionof the universe. Even if he did not already know the glyph, he couldderive its meaning from knowledge of allegorical interpretation, animals,divinity, and so forth. A layperson, however, could not make such a leapof interpretation, not having the foundation knowledge required.In the context of DOP, it is worth noting that all the information aboutelements, animals, and so on, that is all the prerequisite knowledge forinterpreting the hieroglyph, is contained in Book I. In effect, the “secrecy”of the priestly script can be read as a knowledge of natural magic. WhenBook I has been mastered and transcended, the magus is no longer one ofthe “profane” from whom the sacred books must be preserved.Although hieroglyphs are usually thought of as pictures of animals andthe like, we can see this hermeneutic theory in the workings of the sigilsof the magic squares. Without considerable prior knowledge—ofgematria, demonic names, planetary influences, magic squares, mnemo-technics—it is impossible to interpret the figures. With that knowledge,it is clear that the sigils are extremely condensed, multilayered signs.The issue of hieroglyphs in the Renaissance has been discussed in anumber of recent works, and need not be analyzed at length here.65 Withrespect to DOP ’s theory of language in general, however, it is critical torecognize precisely why Renaissance thinkers were wrong: they assumedthat Egyptian writing could not be based upon Egyptian spoken language.This has most commonly been discussed as the prime reason that Egyptiancould not have been deciphered in the Renaissance.

In the journey from sign tomeaning, no detour through the morass of fallen, human language wasrequired. As we shall see, this made the image more powerful magically,but it also made the sign transparent in a way that spoken language couldnever be. The great error of Renaissance linguistics here was to assumethat the Egyptians had succeeded in achieving this goal; indeed, they likelyerred in assuming that the Egyptians had had any interest in this goal.Suppose, however, that Renaissance thinkers had been correct. Thistransparent and powerful hieroglyphic writing would then ground allother forms of writing, which in some sense derived from or were foundedupon hieroglyphic concepts. That is, although in DOP Hebrew writingpreceded hieroglyphics, this does not imply that Hebrew is not a kind ofextended hieroglyphic alphabet. In other words, the idealized notion ofthe hieroglyph permits a smooth transition from ideal pictures andmathematics to alphabetic writing without ever entering the ordinary sphereof linguistics. Spoken and written language could thus be kept apart, in thenatural and the celestial worlds, respectively.Complex SignsIf hieroglyphs are the most iconic form of writing, we have already seenthat they must ground the alphabet in some way. A transitional stage ispresented in the form of geomantic figures, “the middle betwixt imagesand characters. . . . Being engraven or imprinted under the dominion oftheir planets and signs, [they] do conceive the virtue and power ofimages,”66 in the sense that they draw down celestial and elemental powersas al-Kindi describes. At the same time, they are almost characters,because they are made when “geomantical diviners do reduce the pointsof their lots projected, by the excess of parity or imparity,” which is to saythat the geomancer generates the figures by first poking out lines of dotsin the ground, then determining which lines have an odd and which aneven number of dots, then deriving a series of figures from these four"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  13167Agrippa wrote a short treatise which explains all the details of geomantic practice:Geomanticae disciplinae lectura, in Opera 1:500-26, also translated in most editions of TheFourth Book of Occult Philosophy; see also Donald Tyson’s explanation in his Appendix VIIIto DOP, pages 773-84.68DOP I:74, 242/224.

He is clearlyaware of Sefer yez. irah, at least indirectly, because he gives the “dual” letters as bgdkprt(trpkdgb), where resh would not normally be considered dual, i.e. having a doublepronunciation, as for example beth (b) being pronounced “b” or “v”; the list of “dual”binaries.67 Like the magic square sigils, geomantic figures cannot beinterpreted without knowledge of their construction, and are similarlyabstracted (and thus like characters).Hebrew letters are similarly complex in DOP, in that they are not onlycharacters, but also in a sense images, and beyond this rest upon a specialdivine and celestial foundation. “[T]he writing of the Hebrews is of all themost sacred in the figures of characters, points of vowels, and tops ofaccents, being placed in matter, form, and spirit just as the first stars weresown in their positions in the seat of God, which is Heaven.” One readingof this is that Hebrew characters derive from the positions of the stars, andare hence celestial images of some sort. But it can equally be taken tomean that they are like constellations themselves, such that the shapes ofthe characters were impressed upon them directly (i.e. arbitrarily) by God.Every aspect of Hebrew characters has multiple functions in DOP.

A demon’s name is some-times meaningful in a simple sense, in that “sometimes names ofspirits are taken from those things over which they are set,” “being as itwere borrowed from the stars, or men, or places, or times, or such likethings, the divine name [e.g. l), el] being added at the end.” Forexample, Zedekiel is one name of the spirit of Jupiter, from the Hebrewname of Jupiter z.edek [qdc], or “if we call them [these demons] from theLatin words . . . Joviel. . . .”70Names have a singular referent—a demonic name refers only to a singledemon. At the same time, written names are aggregates, combinations ofbasic written forms to make up complex, representative structures.71Moreover, names were impressed upon objects by Adam, and hence havean arbitrary symbolic character not dependent on the characters orelements of which they are constituted. Adam’s function as nomothete iswell known, but it is crucial to recognize the relationship between Adam’snaming and the Divine nominative function.[A]s the great operator doth produce divers species, and particular things bythe influences of the heavens, and by the elements, together with the virtuesof planets; so according to the properties of the influences proper namesresult to things, and are put upon them by him who numbers the multitudeof the stars, calling them all by their names, of which names Christ inanother place speaks, saying, Your names are written in heaven.Adam therefore that gave the first names to things, knowing theinfluences of the heavens, and properties of all things, gave them all namesaccording to their natures, as it is written in Genesis, where God brought allthings that he had created before Adam, that he should name them, and as"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT13372DOP I:70, 233/213.73DOP III:24, 468-69/532; we shall return to this passage in chapter 4 (page 186 below).he named anything, so the name of it was, which names indeed contain inthem wonderful powers of the things signified.Every voice therefore that is significative, first of all signifies by theinfluence of the celestial harmony; secondly, by the imposition of man. . .. But when both significations meet in any voice or name, which are putupon them by the said harmony or man, then that name is with a doublevirtue, viz. natural, and arbitrary, made most efficacious to act, as oft as itshall be uttered in due place, and time, and seriously with an intentionexercised upon the matter rightly disposed, and that can naturally be actedupon by it.72Here the additive nature of reference is made abundantly clear. Names,like signs in general, can be doubly powerful if they combine natural andarbitrary modes of signification. The argument of the whole passage isthat spoken names rely for their power on (1) the celestial world, in theform of the influence of the stars and harmonies, and (2) human (anddivine) reason, in the arbitrary reason of the ultimate nomothetes Adamand Christ. In effect, then, the power of names depends entirely upon therational, celestial world.Celestial names parallel this structure, in the sense that a spirit’s namemay come either from its powers and office or from human imposition. [T]he masters of the Hebrews think that the names of angels were imposedupon them by Adam. . . .

Their referential power seemsto derive partly from the status of the nomothetes, but at the same timeDOP argues that every perfect name is made up of constituent elements,from number through hieroglyph to Hebrew character, such that the totalreferential power is grounded in the fabric of the celestial and naturaluniverse. As we shall see in the next chapter (page 193 below), this relationcan be reversed—it can be argued that the universe depends from thesimple and absolute power of true names, and that all natural and celestialaspects of such names are merely artifacts of the divine names.

For simplicity’s sake,I use C. S. Peirce’s famous triad, icon, index, and symbol. In brief, a symbolis a purely conventional and arbitrary sign, like a word in a naturallanguage. An icon is a sign which is connected with its referent by arelationship of resemblance, like a picture of a thing. An index is a signconnected to its referent by some ontological relationship, like a footprint,a pointing finger, or a label on a jar.74 As we have seen, DOP makes use of all these forms of signification, butconstantly mixes them together for magical purposes. In this section, Ishall explain not only why different sign-types are so readily mixed, butalso why this combinatorics has magical implications. In short, DOP presumes that multiple types of reference can be simultaneously presentin any one sign, and that more references produce a more powerfulconnection between sign and referent.Divine ArbitrarinessThe omnipotent God hath by his providence divided the speech of men intodivers languages; which languages have according to their diversity receiveddivers, and proper characters of writing, consisting in their certain order,number, and figure, not so disposed, and formed by hap, or chance, nor bythe weak judgement of man, but from above, whereby they agree with thecelestial, and divine bodies, and virtues.

Martinand Sarah Goodman (Lincoln, NE and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1983), 293(73v) et passim in book 3.77The complex nature of Hebrew will be particularly important in Book III, whereKabbalah becomes a central issue.78For a fascinating and insightful account of Cratylian thought through the ages, seeGerard Genette, Mimologics, trans.

ButDOP suggests that all writing is of this nature, not just Hebrew, althoughHebrew is clearly the most powerful and divine. Given that all languageis to some degree fallen from its pristine, Adamic state, DOP in effectargues that Hebrew is arbitrary, but that it is not completely so.77Here we have a striking notion of the arbitrary nature of the sign. Inmodern theories, “arbitrary” is generally opposed to “natural,” where thetypical example of “natural signification” is Cratylus’s idea that all wordsultimately derive their meaning from onomatopoeia.78 “Natural” is herea euphemism for concrete, material, real—if a sign had a natural signifi-cance in this sense, it would be obvious to everyone what it must mean,like language before Babel.In DOP, however, a sign ordained by God is both completely arbitraryand completely real in every possible sense of real. It is simply not truethat Hebrew, or any other language, is “natural” in the Cratylian sense, asevery Christian Hebraist was very well aware. But is this because God didnot in any way ordain the Hebrew language, such that it is simply alanguage like any other? On the contrary, all languages are “not so"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE13679DOP II:52, 376-78/409-10.disposed, and formed by hap, or chance, nor by the weak judgement ofman, but from above, whereby they agree with the celestial, and divinebodies, and virtues.”The solution to this apparent paradox is an exceptionally simple pieceof Christian theology: it is man who has fallen, not God—it is thenatural world which is farthest from the ultimately Real. Thus for DOPthe whole relation between arbitrary and natural has to be reversed,because there is no special privilege in “natural” signification. The reasonthat Divinely arbitrary signs are not transparent signifiers is that humanityno longer exists in Paradise, and thus the Divine language is no moreobvious to us than is the Divine Will.IconicityWe are told that the figure of written characters, i.e. their graphicappearance, was laid down “just as the first stars were sown in theirpositions in the seat of God.” In some sense, the shape of the charactersis iconic, such that each letter depicts the stars. Book II, chapter 52discusses “characters which are drawn from things themselves by a certainlikeness.” These characters have “a certain probable similitude with thecelestial images,” in that they are more or less equivalent to drawings ofconstellations or other groupings of stars in which the stars, represented bydots, have been connected with lines (not unlike the construction ofdemonic sigils by connecting letters with lines).79DOP ’s “practice of images” uses images to draw the powers andinfluences desired, by means which parallel al-Kindi rather well. Theimage is constructed of the proper materials, in the proper form, at theproper time, and so forth. In al-Kindi’s terms, the image so constructedis ideally attuned to the relevant rays. As we have seen, though, al-Kindiargues that the two most important parts of image-construction are wordsand will, neither of which appears central to DOP ’s practice in Book II.The use of words in images is indicated in the instructions for theimage of dreams: “thou shalt write upon the breast of the man [in theimage] the name of the effect desired, and in the hand of the angel thename of the intelligence of the Sun.” In the twenty-odd years between thejuvenile draft and the final one, then, a few words have been added to thepractice of images, but there is no indication that these written names are"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  13780See page 14 above.anything but additional empowering signs which increase the image’sindexical connection with its object. In short, the practice of images inII:50 does not seem to reflect al-Kindi’s emphasis on words.As to the effects of will, there is no explicit mention of any act of will,although such acts are central to the ceremonial magic of Book III (page177 below). For the moment, let us note that the creation of an image hasa dual purpose. First, the image has a specific function, as producing truedreams. Second, and more interesting for DOP ’s general theory ofimages, the magician by his practice tries to “give a soul to an image, ormake a stone to live, or metal, or wood, or wax. . . . [and] raise out ofstones children unto Abraham.” At base, then, an image is a form ofwriting which, like the Divine breath, impresses life upon the medium.The implicit theory of iconism can be clarified by recallingPanofsky’s tripartite division of pre-iconography, iconography, andiconology.80 At the most basic level, a magical image is pre-iconographi-cal; it pictorially represents in a manner which is non-cultural, foundedonly upon fundamental natural structures, such as number (in the simplesense), natural form, and so forth. Thus the image for dreams representsin a simple pictorial mode (the man and the angel), and in a natural mode(the image is gold because gold is naturally solar, etc.).At an iconographic level, arbitrary cultural references enter therepresentation. In magical images, these references are rational, basedupon human language and reason, as well as certain celestial structures ofForm, such as the planets and their inherent images. Thus the image fordreams requires cultural knowledge in order to understand clearly thefunction: it is necessary to know that the sun is appropriate for dreams.In addition, the sigil, name, and “name of the effect” written upon theimage require rational knowledge, of language, magical history, andperhaps of the Bible (if the name of the effect is drawn from Scripture).With the move to iconology, the power of the image manifests in atheoretical way. Recall that iconology is the mode of interpretation inwhich the interpreter understands the image as revealing fundamentalstructures of the world which made it. Similarly, the magical imagesdepend on interpretation, not as a scholarly mode but as a mode of powerand action. To put it differently, the image performs its function, definedby its iconography, by manifesting the fundamental structures of the worldupon which it depends. The only absolute difference (and it is a deep"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE138divide) between Panofsky’s theory of representation and that of DOP is theposition of the human agent: in Panofsky, this is the art historian asinterpreter; in DOP the agent is the magus-constructor, controlling theimage’s effect by predetermining its iconological content.Analog SignificationWe have encountered several hints of an additive, cumulative, ordegree-concept theory of signification, particularly obviously in ourdiscussion of names, where DOP spoke of a name having “a double virtue,viz. natural and arbitrary.” We also saw that Hebrew letters refer becauseof an intrinsic property, Divine arbitrariness, and also because they aremodels of or for the placement of the stars, which is a form of iconicity.Further, it is clear that such figures as the planetary characters refer becausethey condense the effects of several sub-systems, i.e. numerologicalsignificance, gematria, geometrical harmony, magic squares, etc.The notion that a sign can refer for multiple reasons and in multipleways, not all of them arbitrary, simultaneously, is crucial for understand-ing DOP ’s theory of signification, and is a concept that I shall call analogsignification. Analog signification is a mode of signifying which cannot beexpressed in binary yes/no terms (signifies/does not signify), but only interms of how much. This idea, although taken more or less for granted inDOP, is quite alien to modern semiotics and linguistic philosophy. Isuspect that analog signification has considerable potential for shaking upmodern philosophies of language, a point to which I return in theconclusion chapter (page 221 below); for the moment, however, it isnecessary to understand the concept and how it functions in DOP.Modern semiotics and linguistic philosophy asks how it is that a signhas meaning. The answer is, at base, invariably the same: all signs signifybecause of arbitrary cultural factors. Umberto Eco argues that Peirce’sicon, which graphically depicts its signified, is based upon arbitrary culturalfactors (i.e. is a symbol) because the nature of graphic representation isfundamentally cultural. The possible exception to this universal arbitrari-ness is Peirce’s index, for which the relation between sign and signifiedrests upon physical (or rather ontological) connection or contiguity.Nonetheless, it can also be argued that indexicality falls into arbitrariness"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  13981See Eco, A Theory of Semiotics, esp. section 3.5, “Critique of iconism,” 191-217.82De vanitate 2, 8-10/19-21.because physical connection and contiguity are culturally determined: theact of pointing has cultural baggage, and is not just a “natural” indicator.81Clearly DOP does not entirely accept this theory, given that thestructure of writing is “not so disposed, and formed by hap, or chance, norby the weak judgement of man, but from above, whereby they agree withthe celestial, and divine bodies, and virtues.” At the same time, Devanitate argues that there is no rule of the Truth, than the decrees and will of some, that did firstteach: the which is most manifestly seen, even by the very invention ofLetters. . . . [A]nd this is the alteration of times [temporum vicissitudo], thatthere are no Letters, no Tongues, the which at this day do acknowledge, orunderstand the form or manner of their Antiquity. . . .82But these positions do not entirely clash, and may be reconciled asfollows: all writing was ordained by Divine providence to correlate withthe celestial and divine; over time, most forms of writing fell from theirprimal state, and concomitantly true knowledge of them was lost.The most fundamental difference between DOP ’s semiotics and itsmodern cousins is that DOP gives no privilege to binary distinction.Semioticians and linguists generally claim to think of signification inbinary terms—in modern English, the written sign “cat” and the spoken\\0kat\\ both refer to the animal. While Jakobson and others might arguethat the written sign “cat” depends upon the spoken system, as we haveseen, this does not alter the fact that “cat” signifies the animal (albeitarbitrarily). Interestingly, however, the logic of Jakobson’s argument thatspoken language has a “primary, fundamental nature” depends on thesame logic as Householder’s argument for the logical priority of writtenlanguage. Implicitly, both are arguing about how much the sign refers, notwhether it refers—if one form of language is “primary,” then it is morefundamental in some sense. The binary nature of reference is thustempered when dealing with written versus spoken language.DOP does not assume that signification is binary. On the contrary, theentire theory is analog, and rests on the notion that a given signifier can bemore or less strongly connected with its signified.

With regard to magical communication,however, signifier and signified can be connected much more strongly. Ifthe connection is sufficiently strong, the magus produces the situationdescribed in al-Kindi, where an alteration of the sign produces a corre-sponding alteration of the referent.In the context of magical writing, as we have seen, the magus mustemploy a chain of reference to other systems—gematria, proportion,numbers, etc.—to make the sign signify at all, or to be sure that it does.83The signifier is not bound to a single such chain, however, but can pointto the signified in a number of ways, by means of multiple exteriorsystems. The most important point about this is that the number anddignity of the systems involved in any given signification process iscumulative: the more distinct and powerful the modes of significationemployed, the greater the ability of the sign to signify—and ultimately tocontrol—its object.DOP ’s theory of analog signification stands Peirce on his head. Everysign is, to some degree, symbol, icon, and index. As a symbol, the sign isarbitrary, determined by intelligences apart from nature. This is true intwo senses—every sign is determined by both human and divine intellects,which are both distinct from nature. As an icon, the sign depends moreor less directly on a pictorial representation of its object. At one extreme,a magical image is nothing more than a complex picture; at the other, thedemonic sigils derive from Hebrew characters and geometry and so forth,and thus depend only very indirectly on iconicity. As an index, the signhas an ontological connection to its object, which can be more or lessstrong, and in the magical context is best expressed as its power.Indexicality: the Power of the SignIndexicality is, as it was for Peirce, rather the wild-card in DOP ’s semiotics.Every sign is an index because there is always an ontological connectionbetween sign and referent, even (as we have seen) with arbitrary naturallanguage. Again, as with the symbolic and the iconic, the indexical qualityof a sign in DOP is one of degree. The Hebrew character kaf (k) is"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  141connected to the Sun because of divine ordination, which divided thealphabet into mothers, duals (planetary), and simples (zodiacal). If kaf isinscribed upon a gold talisman, at an appropriate solar time, it will pointmore strongly toward the Sun—the ontological, indexical character of thesign is strengthened.Here DOP breaks from conventional sign-theory most completely.Contemporaries would certainly have recognized and accepted analogsignification, but by claiming a necessary indexicality DOP makes a logicalbut extremely dangerous move. It is here also that the crux of DOP ’slinguistic theory hangs in the balance, for without the indexicality of allsigns, magic becomes at once haphazard and deeply suspect.The logic of the claim is relatively straightforward. If we grant thepossibility of analog signification, we place all signs on a kind of contin-uum. At one end, we have the almost purely arbitrary signs of ordinaryspeech; here natural iconism is so attenuated as to be irrelevant—DOPdoes not propose a Cratylian theory—but nonetheless natural speechderives from, i.e. is iconically related to, ideal language before Babel, andsimilar arguments can be made about any apparently cultural-arbitrarysign. At the opposite end of the scale, we have Divinely arbitrary signs,which have an obviously ontological relation to their referents: Godspeaks, and the world comes into being. Given this continuum and aNeoplatonic universe, all signs participate in the Divine to some degree.That is, every sign has some relation to the natural, celestial, or divineworld, which by hierarchical participation requires that all signs ultimatelyparticipate in Divinity. Therefore, logically, all signs have ontologicalconnections to their referents.Furthermore, the power of Divine expression is that it creates what isexpressed, makes its meaning actual. By extension, all signs have thispower, although in the vast majority of cases it is insufficient to createeffects. By recognizing the different modes of signification, then addingthem one to another, it is possible to make a sign more ontologicallyconnected to its referent. If the modes of signification employed arehierarchically superior to the referent, e.g. if a celestial sign is employedvis-à-vis a natural object, the sign’s power is likely sufficient to dominatethe referent. Therefore the ultimate effect of a magician’s perfectapplication of DOP ’s semiotic principles is that magical actions dominateworldly things.Most importantly, this domination depends upon one absoluterequirement—that God rule the universe.

Onthe contrary, it is an attempt to restructure knowledge such that it requiresonly the truth of Christian revelation. If it is granted that all humanknowledge is ultimately linguistic/semiotic, i.e. depends entirely uponsigns and signification, then DOP ’s approach is to hang all significationfrom the one immutable point. The parallel to Descartes is peculiar butinteresting: where Descartes descends the scale until he reaches the lowestcommon denominator of reason, cogito ergo sum, and then attempts torebuild knowledge from that fixed point, DOP grants a fixed point in Godand then hangs all knowledge from it.84Inscribing the PowersWe know that “whatsoever is in the mind, in voice, in word, in oration,and in speech, the whole, and all of this is in writing also. And as nothingwhich is conceived in the mind is not expressed by voice, so nothing whichis expressed is not also written.”85 So what is the difference between awritten and a spoken name? And what is the effect of writing a name?Let us recall our extended version of Vachek’s characteristics of writing:interpretive control by the recipient rather than the producer, arbitrarydivisibility, and spatial rather than temporal extension. The latter twoqualities have already been discussed in the context of analog signification:magical signs are arbitrarily divisible both visually and into distinct levels,the totality of the sign’s meaning and power deriving from the sum of allthese factors. We have also seen, in the context of the dominatingindexical power of the sign, that control of the sign is a difficult issue inDOP.

First, one may produceenormous effects in the natural world, as “in former times rocks have beencut off, and valleys made, and mountains made into a plain. . . .” Second,one can impart celestial virtues, “as motion, life, sense, speech, soothsay-ing, and divination, even in matter less disposed, as that which is not madeby nature, but only by art. And so images that speak, and foretell thingsto come, are said to be made, as William of Paris relates of a brazenhead.”89 Writing takes “abstracted, mathematical, and celestial” virtuesand imparts them upon natural objects, making them concrete, thusbringing celestial and divine powers into the natural world.As we know, writing shifts the locus of control from producer torecipient. This characteristic seems to be reversed in DOP, as it is theinscriber who controls the discourse. But it is more accurate to say thatthe inscriber controls the sign inscribed, which is not the same as itsmeaning or significance. With magic squares, for example, the magus isboth producer and in a sense recipient of the marks and characters. Theinscription of a sigil imbues the talisman with demonic power, but thesignificance of the talisman is its application, not the demon. Onceproperly inscribed, the talisman is indexically linked to the demon, but itis not accurate to say that the talisman means the demon, any more thanan electric appliance means electricity. The appliance’s significance is bestunderstood in relation to function, as a refrigerator and food preservation;similarly, a talisman’s significance should be expressed in terms of what itdoes, as with a talisman of the Intelligence of Saturn (Agiel ) which “dothhelp to bring forth, or birth, and to make a man safe, and powerful, andto cause success of petitions with princes, and powers. . . .”Once again, it is clear that DOP makes a peculiar distinction betweeniconicity and symbolism on the one hand, and indexicality on the other.Magical writing is indexically linked to powers, virtues, demons, or othersupernatural forces, but the significance of such writing can only beunderstood in nature, that is by effects, which can in turn be predicted orprescribed by iconism and symbolism."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"SIGN, SIGIL, TEXT  145Fixity and InscriptionWhen a magician writes, he places himself in an analogical relationshipwith the divine. As God deploys language to create life, so the magusdeploys language to vivify. The magus cannot create life, but he cancontrol or channel it, causing an object to acquire life. This operationrequires that the magus be like God in miniature, knowing everythingabout the object, understanding fully the powers employed, spirituallypure in every way.But who can give a soul to an image, or make a stone to live, or metal,or wood, or wax? And who can raise out of stones children unto Abraham?Certainly this arcanum doth not enter into an artist of a stiff neck: neithercan he give those things which hath them not. Nobody hath them but hewho doth (the elements being restrained, nature being overcome, theheavens being overpowered) transcend the progress of angels, and comes tothe very Archetype itself, of which being then made a cooperator may do allthings. . . .Here the argument for the sacred character of magic is particularly explicit.The true magus is one who first dominates and transcends the natural andcelestial, then rises “to the very Archetype itself” in order to become a“cooperator.” The problem of diabolical magic was raised in De vanitatein the context of false miracles, as we saw in chapter one (page 40 above):For all they that presume to divine and prophecy not in the truth, not in thevirtue of God, but in the illusion of devils, according to the operation ofwicked spirits, and exercising deceits of idolatry, and showing illusions andvain visions, the which suddenly ceasing, they avaunt that they can workmiracles, by Magical vanities, . . . all these . . . shall be condemned to thepains of everlasting fire. [emphasis mine].In DOP we see a clear explanation of this passage, in that the true maguswho has risen to the Divine does not claim to work miracles by magical“vanities,” but actually performs miracles in the light and faith of God,whose absolute truth verifies and validates the miracles as something otherthan vanities. Once again, DOP ’s magic attempts a rectification andovercoming of all the “vanities” of knowledge by pinning them all to theunshakeable truth of faith."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE146ConclusionsIn chapter two, we saw that DOP ’s natural magic is in a sense investiga-tive, a process of understanding the nature of God incarnate in the world.At the same time, the natural magic is “operative,” to use Yates’s term, inthat the higher aspects of human nature (those which touch the celestial,such as fantasy and especially reason) have a material impact. Notsurprisingly, then, we have found that the mathematical magic, rooted inthe celestial, is a magic of enacting, of understanding and manipulating theways in which the higher functions dominate nature. Since mathematicaland celestial magic is superior to the natural, the hierarchical structure ofDOP and the universe ensures that the former dominates the latter. Thusmastery of mathematical magic entails dominance over the natural world.The central theoretical issue of Book II is linguistic or semiotic, focusedon the nature of signification. When this communicative orientation isplaced in context, between the natural and the divine, it becomes clear thatthe mathematical communicates between the two, such that the magusapproaches the divine through the celestial. Ultimately, Book II proposesa skeleton theory of the sign in a (to us) peculiar context: granted God’sexistence, goodness, omnipotence, etc., how can signs function and whatdo they accomplish?In the next chapter, I turn to the final portion of DOP, the religious orceremonial magic (Book III), in which the occult philosophy comes tofruition. We shall see that, just as there are three worlds, there are threemodes of language, and that the true magus’s destiny is to dominate allworlds through command of all languages and thus of all realities."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELSThe most fleeting thought obeys an invisible plan, andmay crown, or inaugurate, a secret design. . . . No one issomeone; a single immortal man is all men. LikeCornelius Agrippa, I am god, hero, philosopher, demon,and world—which is a long-winded way of saying thatI am not.—Jorge Luis Borges, The ImmortalIn Book III, we move to the consummation of the magical art, the divine,religious, or ceremonial magic, which completes the magical and philo-sophical project begun in Books I and II. In the interest of clarity, let mebriefly recapitulate the problems which remain at the outset.In Book I, DOP implied that demonic magic is not only licit, butperhaps required for the highest forms of magic; Book III takes up thisquestion explicitly, discussing demonic magic quite openly. In the presentanalysis, then, we must discover (1) what exactly is meant by demonicmagic, and (2) how contact with demons can elevate the magus to thedivine. Furthermore, we must ask what purpose is served by suchelevation; that is, what the point of demonic magic is, and how it fits intothe more general problematic of the magician’s relationship to God.In Book II, the primary focus was linguistic, demonstrating thephilosophical possibility of transparent and powerful written signs. As webegin reading Book III, it is not clear how this power of writing interactswith divinity. In other words, if the natural world is ruled by the powerof speech, and the celestial world by that of writing, what linguisticstructure applies to the divine? Beyond this, we must ask what kind oflinguistic relationships obtain between the magician and the forces whichrule the divine sphere, not only God Himself but also the angels.Book III includes DOP ’s most detailed discussions of both Kabbalahand ritual, issues which haunted the margins of both the natural andespecially the celestial magic. In the present chapter, then, it will becrucial to situate DOP with respect to scholarship on Kabbalah and ritual.This analysis raises a number of questions whose answers will inform our"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR148understanding of DOP in general; in the conclusion chapter they will alsoaid in explicating the ramifications of our reading of DOP for scholarshipon the history and theory of magic.With respect to Kabbalah, the primary question is whether Agrippa’sritual-magical Kabbalah is Kabbalah at all. As we shall see, this leads totwo broader issues: magic in Kabbalah generally, and the relationshipbetween Christian Kabbalah and its Jewish sources. I shall argue thatAgrippa’s Kabbalah is a deeply Christian and skeptical reinterpretation ofKabbalah, which nevertheless is not fundamentally at odds with thetradition of Kabbalah as it came down to him.The second problem, that of magical ritual, takes us into the realm ofritual theory. At heart, the question here is whether Agrippa’s ritual magiccan be understood as ritual, which is really dependent on the more generalquestion of whether magic is religion. I do not propose to address thelatter question in detail, although some consideration of the problem willappear in the conclusion chapter. For the moment, I shall simply take itfor granted that DOP ’s ritual magic is indeed ritual.At the same time, the framework of Agrippa’s magic is such that itrequires some rethinking of ritual theory more generally; in particular,much of the semiotic or symbolic interpretive theory of ritual dependsupon a highly logocentric conception of language, privileging speech overwriting in a way radically inconsistent with Agrippa’s magical precepts. Assuch, I will propose a writing-centered approach to ritual, whose value willI hope be borne out by its effectiveness in the analysis.In what follows, then, I have three objectives. First and foremost, Iwish to demonstrate that Book III does indeed propose a theory whichconnects the various problems and hanging threads from Books I and II,and furthermore does so in a way which satisfies the theological concernsat hand. Second, I want to show that this theory, depending as it doesupon a written rather than oral model of communication, fits quite neatlyinto Kabbalistic structures, and thus indicates that academic dismissals ofmagical Christian Kabbalah are over-hasty. Third, I would like to suggestthat the written theory of ritual magic proposed here has considerableutility for modern scholars of ritual. Moreover, I believe such a theory willaid materially in rethinking magic as a distinct category, not divorced fromthat of religion but nevertheless not entirely coterminous with it; this lastpoint will be discussed in more detail in the concluding chapter."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS1491Interestingly, Agrippa makes similar distinctions in De vanitate 47, 99/135-36:“They deliver a double science therefore, the one of Bresith, which they call Cosmology,viz: explaining the powers of things created, natural, and celestial, and expounding thesecrets of the Law and Bible by philosophical reasons. . . . They call the other sciencethereof of Mercaba, which is concerning the more sublime contemplations of divine andangelic virtues, and of sacred names, and seals. . . . This again they divide into Arithmancy,viz. that which is called Notariacon, treating of angelical virtues, names, and seals. . . andinto Theomancy, which searcheth into the mysteries of divine majesty, as the emanationsthereof, and sacred names. . . .” The text reads “Mercara” or “Mercana,” depending onedition, clearly a printer’s error, as noted by François Secret, Les Kabbalistes Chrétiens de laRenaissance, 2d ed.

Thus weread of merkavah (chariot) mysticism and bereshit (creation) mysticism,Zoharic and Yez.iratic traditions, and so forth.1 Premier among thesedistinctions, however, is that between theosophical and ecstatic Kabbalah.This division has come to center-stage primarily through the work ofGershom Scholem and of Moshe Idel, Scholem’s most important student.In essence, the distinction is between an abstract, contemplative, ortheoretical Kabbalah and an active, practical Kabbalah. At the same time,the term “practical Kabbalah” has its own meaning, whose contestationand limitation within the scholarly community are rarely overt, but colorall major studies of Kabbalah. The underlying argument is important andproblematic, and before turning to Kabbalah in DOP I must devote somespace to the category of “practical Kabbalah” as it relates to theosophicaland ecstatic Kabbalah, particularly as “practical Kabbalah” is oftenunderstood to have some overlap with “magic.”Prior to the work of Gershom Scholem the category “Kabbalah,” or“Jewish Mysticism,” was usually pejorative and opposed to “RabbinicPhilosophy” or a similarly rationalistic category. Antisemitic scholars sawin Kabbalah the stupidity and superstition which they expected from Jews,while their philosemitic opponents wished to promote Jewish thought andhistory by calling attention to facets of that tradition more congenial to alate-nineteenth century scholarly audience. Thus the general agreementwas that Kabbalah was not worth discussing—regardless of a givenscholar’s opinion of Judaism and the Jewish people, it was taken forgranted that Kabbalah was superstitious nonsense.2"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR1503Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken, 1946).Through his tremendous output of books and articles, of which MajorTrends in Jewish Mysticism is one of the most influential, Scholem nearlysinglehandedly re-invented scholarly opinion of Kabbalah.3 So successfulwas this re-invention that it became possible to write dissertations andbooks about the subject, even to be a “Kabbalah expert” in a scholarly andentirely respectable sense. Indeed in modern Jewish studies, the eruditionof “real Kabbalah experts” occasions considerable veneration and awe.Scholem’s restoration of Kabbalah to respectability required him tomake certain more or less deliberate oversimplifications, in essence public-relations moves. For our purposes, the most relevant of these was hisextreme (over)emphasis on the philosophical, systematic, and mystical-contemplative side of Kabbalah, and his concomitant suppression ofpractical and ecstatic Kabbalah. In short, Scholem made it appear thatKabbalah was predominantly an intellectual tradition of mysticalcontemplation, and implied that the ecstatic or magical parts of thattradition were irrelevant bastardizations. By this sleight—and it is surelya sleight to hide what may be the majority of Kabbalistic documents andpractices!—he promoted Kabbalah as worthy of intellectual respect andstoutly defended it against charges of superstition.Once Scholem had succeeded, however, it was inevitable that Kabbalahexperts would wish to re-balance the equation; this project has fallen, inlarge part, to Scholem’s student Moshe Idel. In his own considerablescholarly output, beginning with a doctoral dissertation on AbrahamAbulafia, Idel has argued for the central importance to Kabbalah of thevery practices once labeled “superstitious,” i.e. practical Kabbalah. In hisaward-winning book Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Idel divided theKabbalistic traditions into two main camps: the theosophical, which is tosay the kinds of contemplative, philosophical ideas and figures emphasizedby Scholem, and the ecstatic, on which he himself focused. Now that noserious scholar would dismiss Kabbalah on any grounds, Idel and hiscontemporaries could open up the possibility of studying the entire rangeof Kabbalistic material, from the earliest origins to the most recentincarnations, from the most abstract and contemplative to the mostpractical and applied forms.At the same time Idel, until recently, subdivided the range of “accept-able” Kabbalah far more subtly than did Scholem.

This approach is not new; it has been in usesince the Renaissance, when Christian scholars interesting in occult loresinvolved themselves in the study of the Kabbalah. . . . But the evaluation ofKabbalah as predominantly theoretical rather than practical is misleading.4As the discussion continues, it becomes clear that “practical” Kabbalah isessentially equivalent to “ecstatic” Kabbalah; thus the addition of AbrahamAbulafia or of Hasidic ecstatic practices apparently makes Kabbalah, thescholarly object of study, coterminous with Kabbalah, the lived and livingtradition of Jewish mysticism. As Jonathan Z. Smith has noted, theaddition of “practical Kabbalah” to modern scholarship has reallyamounted to the addition of “mystical techniques,” and has excluded themajority of what would more usually be called magic.5But in some of his most recent books, Idel reveals implicitly that hisearlier formulations actually discarded certain texts and practices—specifically, he had rejected forms of practical Kabbalah which do not fitinto the narrower categories of ecstatic and theosophical Kabbalah, i.e.those which might be called magic.Three Kabbalistic ModelsIdel’s most extended meditation on magic and its place in Kabbalahcomes in his recent book on H. asidism,6 in which he distinguishes amongthree “models”:Three basic models can be seen competing throughout the history ofJewish mysticism: the theosophical-theurgical one, represented mosteminently by Zoharic literature and the Safedian Kabbalah; the ecstatic,expressed in the writings of R.

On thesources of early Christian Kabbalah, the most important scholarship is that of ChaimWirszubski, particularly his Pico della Mirandola’s Encounter with Jewish Mysticism(Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press, 1989), particularly pages 10-68.For Agrippa’s sources particularly, see the annotations to Perrone Compagni’s criticaledition of DOP. A reading of Wirszubski indicates clearly the almost incredible range ofscholarship required to detail all the manuscript sources for an early Christian Kabbalist;the fact that Pico died after only eight years of Kabbalistic study makes all the moredaunting any extended analysis of the sources for Reuchlin or the later ChristianKabbalists, and explains why no such study has to my knowledge ever been attempted.a distinct body of Jewish mystical literature, but is present in certain writingsof the other two models.7Historiographically, these three models can also be associated withparticular scholars: Scholem emphasized the theosophical-theurgical, theearlier Idel and most of his Israeli contemporaries emphasized the ecstatic,and the late Idel and some American scholars have included (if not perhapsemphasized) the magical.The theosophical-theurgical model, so central in Gershom Scholem’sscholarship, revolves around cosmological speculation of various sorts,most famously the theory of the ten emanations (sefirot) through which orby which the Creation was produced. The sefirot are usually greatlyoversimplified in the numerous summaries of this doctrine which appearin scholarship on Christian Kabbalah, but in fact the Kabbalistic textsdiscussing the emanations are extremely various and complex; indeed,scholars from Scholem onwards have devoted many lengthy studies tocomparative analyses of emanationist cosmologies and their theologicalprecepts. For our purposes, it is sufficient to recognize that the sefirot were“conceived sometimes as the essence of God, and at other times as thevessel of the divine influx or the instruments of the divine activity.”8 Inthe context of Agrippa’s exposure to Kabbalistic thought it is primarilyZoharic theosophy which is relevant, as several works of this kind weremade available in Latin in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries,and were of particular importance to the Kabbalistic thought of GiovanniPico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin.9Through the translations, mistranslations, and reinterpretations of histeacher Flavius Mithridates, Pico was also aware of ecstatic literature,particularly that of Abraham Abulafia.

Paranormal experiences, such as revelations and prophecies, are alsointegral to this type of mystical model, more consonant with it than they arewith theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah. . . .The paramount importance of thelinguistic components of these techniques must also be emphasized. . . .11As Idel himself admits, “The extent of the magical influence on Jewishmysticism is an issue that still awaits detailed treatment.”12 Some textspresume that the special character of the Hebrew language enables itsmanipulators to have “magical” effects in the world, specifically by drawingdown the power of the higher spheres. Others claim that “it is by cleavingto the spiritual source that rules this world—the universal soul—that themystic or philosopher is able to affect the events in the sublunar world,” anidea which apparently stems from medieval contact between Jewish andArabic thinkers.13 The distinction made by Idel is between the magician’sdrawing down celestial forces on the one hand, and his rising above tocommand them on the other. He further notes a moral distinction betweenthe two often made in Jewish sources from the fifteenth century and later,according to which “It is by fulfilling the divine will that the material andspiritual attainments are drawn down and not by attempts to force that willor short-circuit the order of nature.”14If in Idel’s formulation there are three “models” in Kabbalah, the magicalmodel does not arise from its own literature but is found expressed in someworks of the other two models.

Insofar as an implicit judgment can be derived from Secret, itwould appear that he favors Reuchlin and the Italian Kabbalists (FrancescoZorzi, Egidius da Viterbo) over others;17 he is wary of Agrippa, whom heaccuses of a “curiosité trop charlatanesque.”18 In fact, “charlatanesque” isSecret’s most common negative adjective, suggesting that for him, theextension of Christian Kabbalah into extreme realms of magic anddemonology was unfortunate, a misunderstanding likely prompted byunsavory motivations.At the same time, it is worth noting that most of the negative assessmentsof Christian Kabbalah depend upon a kind of comparative gradation, notlogically dissimilar to the old-fashioned positivistic model of the history ofscience, in which early scientists were graded on their accuracy with respectto the now-known facts of natural phenomena. In particular, the commonbasis of the criticisms of Christian Kabbalah is that its expositors misunder-stood what Kabbalah is really about, and instead focused most of theirattention on elements marginal to if not entirely outside the purview of trueKabbalah. In short, Christian Kabbalists (or some of them) got it wrong,because they wasted their time on magic, numerology, and alphabeticmanipulation rather than the theosophical, philosophical, contemplativecore of Kabbalah.Given our previous sketch of Kabbalistic models, it will come as nosurprise that most scholarship on Christian Kabbalah has been based uponthe work of Gershom Scholem, whose own assessment of the magicaltendencies of Christian Kabbalah was largely negative:"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR15619Gershom Scholem, Kabbalah (New York, London: Penguin Meridian, 1978), 198.20Frances Yates, The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age (London: Routledge &Kegan Paul, 1979; reprint, London: ARK, 1983), 2.21Yates, Occult Philosophy, 47.22Wolf-Dieter Müller-Jahncke, “Agrippa von Nettesheim et la kabbale,” in AntoineFaivre, ed.

They led on the one hand to considerable interest in the doctrineof Divine Names and in practical Kabbalah, and on the other hand to furtherspeculative attempts to achieve a synthesis between kabbalistic motifs andChristian theology. The place of honor accorded to practical Kabbalah inCornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim’s great compendium De Occulta Philosophia. . . was largely responsible for the mistaken association of the Kabbalah in theChristian world with numerology and witchcraft.19Based upon her reading of Scholem, Frances Yates stated that Kabbalah“was basically a method of religious contemplation which could, rathereasily, pass into a kind of religious magic, though such a use of it wasactually a degradation of its higher purposes.”20 Similarly, she suspects that“the genuine Hebrew Cabalist might be shocked by Agrippa’s interpretationof Cabala solely as white magic. . . .”21Fundamentally, there is a distinction made here between Kabbalah andmagic; to the extent that a given work of Christian Kabbalah eschews thelatter and is more or less accurate about the former—i.e. the sefirot andrelated theosophical concepts—that work is considered worthwhile.Agrippa’s work, on the other hand, is mere compilation, however broad-ranging: “The third book of De occulta philosophia contains, in fact, such agreat number of references to pseudo-Kabbalistic ideas [idées prétendumentkabbalistiques] that it is appropriate to regard the book as a ‘summa’” of suchideas.22In the scholarly literature on early Christian Kabbalah—up to the timeof Agrippa, that is—Reuchlin’s is the usual model, as we have seen withSecret.

The next greatChristian Kabbalist, in the usual listing, would be Zorzi (Francesco Giorgi,1466-1540), whose De harmonia mundi of 1525 is chock-full of variouskinds of Kabbalistic speculations. Unfortunately, the size, technicalvocabulary, and rarity of the volume seem to have precluded much detailedmodern scholarship, and as such there is no general agreement about Zorzi’sthought in general or his Kabbalah in particular. As to Agrippa himself, wehave seen that the usual reading of his Kabbalah is that he mangles Jewishmysticism in favor of radical demonic magic. In essence, then, Agrippa’sKabbalah is usually compared with two models—Reuchlin’s and Scholem’s.But Reuchlin’s version of Kabbalah is not greatly at odds with Scholem’s;that is, Reuchlin places the cosmological speculations of theosophicalKabbalah at the center of his treatment, and various forms of linguistic andnumerological manipulations at the margins, serving primarily as proof-texts. In the later De arte cabalistica, Reuchlin’s primary focus is notpractical or ecstatic, and he denounces those who equate Kabbalah withmagic:According to our [the Jews’] forbears’ records, the working of miracles of thiskind was so easy for Kabbalists that many spiteful cynics called them slymagicians—all as if it were not Michael who worked these deeds, but Samuel,through the medium of Egyptian spells and secret signs, and this despite thefact that the Kabbalists’ wand always stays the conjurors’, and that godlinessworks far more effectively than any deviltry. The skills of Kabbalah tend towork for the good of man, while the poison of false magic leads to theirdownfall.24It is essential to note, furthermore, that Reuchlin Christianizes Kabbalahmainly by drawing parallels, arguing for fundamental agreement, and then"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR15825The argument appears in Reuchlin, De arte cabalistica, 79r, N-O (353), and is alsomentioned in Pico’s Theses 11>14-16 (Farmer, 527), and runs something like this. TheTetragrammaton, the four-letter holiest name of God, becomes a five-letter name (thePentagrammaton) when one of the three mothers (i.e. #m)) is added. Of the threemothers, shin # is understood to refer to activation, realization, and perfection; as such, thePentagrammaton made of the Tetragrammaton plus shin should be the Name of theMessiah. One of the possible names so generated is hw#hy, which might be pronouncedsomething like Yesu. In other words, the true name of the Messiah, Kabbalisticallydetermined in this manner, is Jesus.26De vanitate 47, 100/136.by superadding the famous claim that the Tetragrammaton transmutes intothe Pentagrammaton.25 What does not occur in Reuchlin, so far as I can see,is a systematic rethinking of Kabbalistic premises in Christian terms. Assuch, modern scholars uncomfortable with the colonialist implications ofa Christian appropriation of Kabbalah can grant some legitimacy toReuchlin, in that he does not greatly alter the substance of the teachings herelates, and furthermore his necessarily limited knowledge of Jewishmystical texts ensures that De arte cabalistica cannot help but be sim-pler—and perhaps shallower—than the best of Jewish Kabbalah.Agrippa’s version of Kabbalah is quite different, though he has deeprespect for Reuchlin and his work. But is it accurate to say that Agrippa’sChristian Kabbalah is unfaithful to Kabbalistic thought? I suggest that, onthe contrary, he simply emphasizes other sources and models—thusYoh.anan Alemanno’s magico-mystical model becomes relatively central, asit had been for Pico. Similarly, Agrippa leans more heavily on ecstatic thanon theosophical sources. Taken in toto, Agrippa’s version of Kabbalah is notin its sources or structures necessarily unfaithful to the Kabbalah availablein early modern Europe, but relies on magical and ecstatic models ratherthan theosophical ones.As we shall see, however, DOP also rethinks Kabbalah on a Christianbasis, rather than simply relating Kabbalistic concepts with occasionalChristian glosses. Herein lies Agrippa’s “misunderstanding” of Kabbalah—he cuts it off to a great degree from its Jewish roots. Indeed, the attack in Devanitate denounces Kabbalah precisely because it is Jewish, because “thetraitorous Jews do also affirm that Christ by this Art did oftentimeswonderful things [i.e. miracles].”26For this cause the Jews very well skilled in the names of God can work little ornothing after Christ, as their ancient Fathers were wont.

By this standard, Reuchlin’s Kabbalah is not atbase Christian Kabbalah; on the other hand Agrippa’s Kabbalah is equallynot a gross misunderstanding of Jewish Kabbalah, but rather a coherentChristian reinterpretation. The primary reasons for rejecting such a readingare political, not systematic, based on a priori rejection of ChristianKabbalah as a legitimate form.Esotericism, Occultism, and MagicModern scholarship on magic in the West, particularly from the Renais-sance onwards, largely falls under the more general heading of “esotericism.”This field is conspicuously dominated by the figure of Antoine Faivre, whosucceeded François Secret in the chair of “History of Esoteric and MysticalCurrents in Modern and Contemporary Europe” at the École Pratique desHautes Études in Paris.28 Although the majority of his analytical works aredevoted to eighteenth-century materials, particularly Franz von Baader andMasonic Theosophy, several of Faivre’s introductory essays elucidate generalmethodology and definitions.29 In order to situate our discussion of DOPwith respect to mystical and esoteric thought, it is worthwhile to examinethese definitions closely.Faivre’s definition of esotericism is semi-phenomenological, of the type,“X must have the following components, and often has the followingadditional components.” There are four required components: (1) acorrespondence-theory of the universe, in which “symbolic and realcorrespondences . . . are said to exist among all parts of the universe, both"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR16030Faivre, Access, 10-13.31Faivre, Access, 12.32Faivre, Access, 13.seen and unseen;” (2) a notion of living nature, implying both the practicalapplication of correspondences to produce effects and the knowledge ofsuch praxis understood as gnosis; (3) “imagination and mediations,” whichis to say that the imagination and memory interact with mediatingstructures (Faivre lists “rituals, symbolic images, mandalas, intermediaryspirits”) to contact the divine and develop gnosis; and finally (4) the“experience of transmutation,” in which the esoteric practitioner is utterlytransformed by and for the gnosis in question, such that in alchemy forinstance there can be “no separation between knowledge (gnosis) and innerexperience, or intellectual activity and active imagination if we want to turnlead into silver or silver into gold.”30 Each of these four components must be present, according to Faivre,before we may call some system of thought “esotericism.” More specifically,each can be understood to distinguish esotericism from some other mode ofthought, such that with all four present, the system can be nothing otherthan esoteric. In particular, the correspondences distinguish an esotericsystem from one based on “the principles of noncontradiction and excludedmiddle of linear causality,” and living nature distinguishes it from ascientific or monist one. The idea of “imagination and mediations”distinguishes esotericism from mysticism: In somewhat oversimplified terms, we could say that the mystic . . . aspires tothe more or less complete suppression of images and intermediaries becausefor him they become obstacles to the union with God. While the esoteristappears to take more interest in the intermediaries revealed to his inner eyethrough the power of his creative imagination than to extend himselfessentially toward the union with the divine. He prefers to sojourn on Jacob’sladder where angels (and doubtless other entities as well) climb up and down,rather than to climb to the top and beyond.31Transmutation is in some respects formally different from the other threecomponents, in that a system with the other three elements present, butlacking the experience of transmutation, “would hardly exceed the limits ofa form of speculative spirituality.”32 In effect, it is transmutation, in thesense of initiation (especially ritual initiation) into gnosis which marksesoteric thought as a distinctive modality."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS16133Faivre, Access, 14.34Faivre, Access, 19.The two remaining more or less optional components are (5) “the praxisof concordance,” i.e. the theory that there is a truth behind all truths, or areligion behind all religions, such that the practice of establishing commondenominators among several systems is understood to produce illumination;and (6) an emphasis on transmission, which “implies that an esotericteaching can or must be transmitted from master to disciple following apreestablished channel, respecting a previously marked path.”33There are several grave methodological problems with this sort ofdefinition, as should already be apparent from the critiques of MirceaEliade’s work over the last few decades. In particular, Faivre falls into thedangerous trap of exclusivity: in order to avoid anachronism and what inother spheres have been called “category mistakes,” he asks that scholarsrefrain either from treating esotericism as something else or, conversely,from treating systems that are not really esoteric as esotericism.. . .

We should extricate it, if possible from the recuperators, scholarlyor otherwise. . . . The approach proposed here translates thus a twofoldconcern. On the one hand, to have differences respected; on the other hand,to carry empirical research, without ideological apriori, of transversalpathways and converging byways. . . . Let us preserve this term so suitable fordenoting an ensemble of cultural and religious realities, which a familyresemblance seems to bind together sufficiently to authorize our making thema field of study.34Faivre’s exclusivity is both naive and potentially damaging to futurescholarship. The valorization of “empirical research, without ideologicalapriori” presumes that such research is possible, where precisely the contraryhas been argued by half a century of historians and philosophers—I amthinking here not only of so-called postmodern theorists but also ofhermeneutic thinkers such as Paul Ricoeur. Furthermore, one shouldalways beware of methodological precepts that close off or prevent particularsorts of questions and analyses, most especially when we are told that theseprecepts are dictated by the needs of “empirical research” and the authorityof “a field of study.”But the conjunction of the call for “respect for difference” with thedemand that we “not consider it a bearer of a spiritual or semantic value that"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR16235Faivre, Access, 108, referring to Mircea Eliade, A History of Religious Ideas, trans.

The definition in six parts which wehave already discussed is, for Faivre, a fairly accurate catalogue of thecomponents of esotericism as it really is. Esotericism is here understood tobe sui generis, to use Eliade’s infamous phrase; in other words, it cannot becompared to other phenomena, but must be understood on its owngrounds.One should not think that Faivre is unaware of these problems. He iswell-versed in the scholarship of the History of Religions, in which at onetime such terms as “essentialism”, “sui generis”, and “category mistake” wereemployed like mantras. Why, then, does Faivre fall into so many of thesame traps as did Eliade? The answer is actually quite simple: not unlikeEliade with religion, Faivre really believes that esotericism is sui generis, thatit cannot be compared to other phenomena, because he thinks that trueesoteric thought is the path by which modern humanity can escape orremedy its fallen spiritual condition.It is no accident . . . if human sciences like anthropology, history ofreligions, etc., are open to esotericism and vice versa. Pico della Mirandola’sDiscourse on human “dignity” has once more become an actuality. It isincumbent on humanity to engage in continuous redefinition to discover orrediscover its place within Nature and within a universal culture and society.The magisterial work of Mircea Eliade . . . responds well to this doubledemand of culture and universality. According to him the first demandrepresents today the indispensable detour for entering into any “initiation”worthy of the name. The second, understood as the intelligence of differencesas much as resemblances, is as removed from narrow historicism as fromartificial universalism, abstract or disincarnate. No exclusivism either, in thatcorpus, which gives to esoteric currents the place they deserve.35Again,Einstein said that science was not made to give flavor to the soup.

Faivre also shows his theosophical project clearly in The Golden Fleece andAlchemy (Albany: SUNY, 1993) and The Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to AlchemicalMagus, trans. Joscelyn Godwin (Grand Rapids, MI: Phanes Press, 1995); both booksextrapolate philosophical, or rather theosophical, concepts from mythological evidence,with the more or less explicit intention that readers work to bring these myths into theirlives. A similar project informs the work of Faivre’s disciple Joscelyn Godwin; see forexample Harmonies of Heaven and Earth: The Spiritual Dimension of Music from Antiquityto the Avant-Garde (London: Thames and Hudson, 1987); The Harmony of the Spheres: ASourcebook of the Pythagorean Tradition (Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions International,1993); and The Theosophical Enlightenment (Albany: SUNY, 1994).Note that Faivre’s and Godwin’s adherence to esoteric ideals does not make their workworthless, only that one should be cautious; I do not think either scholar knowingly cantshis analyses to promote esotericism as such, and I have analyzed Faivre’s thought in detailprecisely because it is extremely valuable. By contrast, there is (still) a considerable semi-scholarly literature on esoteric or occult history produced by scientistic or positivisticwriters whose ideological presuppositions entail the uselessness of their pseudo-scholarship.abstraction quickly causes us to forget, or even deny—the only one, in anycase, that permits us to rediscover the absolute identity between the Man ofKnowledge and the Man of Desire.36What can one do if, like myself, one is deeply suspicious of a scholarlyproject rooted in a concealed religious project, particularly when thetechnique of concealment involves hypocritical claims to “empiricalresearch, without ideological apriori?” The simple solution, of course,would be to discard Faivre’s methodology and definition entirely. But, aswith Eliade—or Frances Yates for that matter—this would mean discardinggold along with the dross. My own preference is to keep the definition,subject to revision of course, and shift its grounds from some idealized “realesotericism” to the equally arcane world of academic methodology andtheory. In other words, we simply take the definition to apply to a category,constructed by and for academics interested in such subjects, which enablesanalysis and comparison; conversely, any and all of the components may beset aside when they cease to be enabling.The advantage of retaining the definition in this manner is that it enablescomparisons by providing a series of interesting and complex criteria. If twophenomena are found to possess the four “required” components, forexample, we have some sense of where to begin analysis—with questionswhich relate to the general problem of esotericism and which serve todifferentiate the two systems within that context; thus far, I think, Faivrewould agree.

Instead, I make periodicuse of his six categories to elucidate patterns of ideas in DOP. Futurescholarship must determine, as a comparative endeavor, the extent to whichthe category of esotericism is usefully applied to Agrippa, and to earlymodern magic more generally.Ritual MagicIn previous chapters, I have used various sources as conversation partners forAgrippa. Thus we have used Ficino’s natural magic to clarify Agrippa’s, andlinguistic theories of writing to give us a vocabulary and a set of questionswith which to explicate Agrippa’s semiotics. In this chapter, discussions ofKabbalah and esotericism serve a similar function, and the primary purposeof the present section is to explicate some aspects of modern ritual theorywhich will be of value for understanding Agrippa’s approach to ritual magic.At the same time, I have an additional purpose in discussing ritualtheory. Not only do I want to show that Agrippa’s theory of ritual iscomplex and interesting, but I contend that a theoretical extrapolation fromit will be of more general utility and applicability in the field of ritualstudies. In other words, I think that DOP ’s theory of ritual—updated andexpanded to cover a wider range of materials—will be a useful addition tothe toolbox of the scholar of ritual.In order to make this case efficiently, I have selected a single moderntheory of ritual to represent a larger class of such theories; specifically, I useStanley Jeyarajah Tambiah’s famous “performative approach” to explicateboth the “symbolic” approach37 to ritual and its problems.To put it very broadly, the symbolists eschew a tight linkage betweenritual and social function, and focus instead on the ways in which ritual canbe understood as linguistic performance. In contrast to the loose analogiesbetween ritual and language drawn by such thinkers as Radcliffe-Brown and"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS16538Stanley Jeyarajah Tambiah, “The Magical Power of Words,” Man, n.s. 3 (1968),175-208; “Form and Meaning of Magical Acts,” in Robin Horton and Ruth Finnegan,eds., Modes of Thought: Essays on Thinking in Western and Non-Western Societies (London:Faber and Faber, 1972); “A Performative Approach to Ritual,” Proceedings of the BritishAcademy 65 (1979): 113-69; and Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).39Stock examples here are such speech-acts as christening a ship, or saying (in theappropriate cultural context) “I now pronounce you man and wife.” The speech-actaccomplishes the end—the couple are married. Illocutionary communication thus differsfrom other locutive modes in that the audience for the speech-act need not be convincedof the validity of the argument. Paul Ricoeur nicely summarizes the three aspects ofdiscourse in this sense: “The act of speaking . . . is constituted by a hierarchy of subordinateacts which are distributed on three levels: (1) the level of the locutionary or propositionalact, the act of saying; (2) the level of the illocutionary act or force, that which we do insaying; and (3) the level of the perlocutionary act, that which we do by saying:” PaulRicoeur, “The Model of the Text,” Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences, trans. John B.Thompson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 199.Eliade, the analyses of the symbolists employ concepts from linguistics andsemiotics in a relatively sophisticated manner. But semiotics is not a “quickfix” for ritual; indeed, ritual theories which grow out of linguistic theoriesinherit the flaws and fallacies of their parent discipline, as I shall demon-strate using Tambiah as a case in point.In Tambiah’s “performative approach” to ritual and magic,38 largelyderived from John Austin’s speech-act theory, magic—which Tambiahunderstands to be simply a kind of ritual—is analyzed as a form ofcommunication. Further, this communicative action is like Austin’sillocutionary speech—the communicative act is itself the conclusion ratherthan a proposition. In short, saying is doing.39 In the brief analysis thatfollows, I want to question two central constructs of Tambiah’s theorywhich, I think, are widely accepted among a broad class of ritual theorists.In both cases, it is questions raised in earlier chapters of the present workthat give the initial impetus to criticism. First, the notion that ritual is “communication” generally presumesimplicitly that normative communication is spoken. As we have seen fromAgrippa’s mathematical magic, however, it is possible to construct a magicaltheory of language and semiotics which presumes that normative communi-cation is written. If rituals (and especially so-called magical ones) areanalyzed as written communication, a good deal of ritual theory requiresextensive revision.Second, the problem of falsification: if a magical act is supposed toproduce some effect, and if, so far as the outside observer can discern, the acth a s n o m e c h a n i s m b y w h i c h t o d o s o , w h y d o e s m a g i c n o t d i e o u t ?

Tambiah does not answer this question; instead, heuses speech-act theory to prevent it—one cannot ask whether a ritual works,only what and how it communicates. Agrippa’s approach to natural magicvis-à-vis skepticism, however, suggests a perspective from which a givenritual or magical practice might apparently fail utterly without this fact’s inany way contradicting the validity of the practice.Ritual CommunicationLet me begin with Tambiah’s definition of ritual:Ritual is a culturally constructed system of symbolic communication. It isconstituted of patterned and ordered sequences of words and acts, oftenexpressed in multiple media, whose content and arrangement are character-ized in varying degree by formality (conventionality), stereotypy (rigidity),condensation (fusion), and redundancy (repetition). Ritual action in itsconstitutive features is performative in these three senses: in the Austiniansense of performative wherein saying something is also doing something as aconventional act; in the quite different sense of a staged performance that usesmultiple media by which the participants experience the event intensively;and in the third sense of indexical values . . . being attached to and inferred byactors during the performance.40These peculiar characteristics of ritual as opposed to “ordinary” communi-cation are entailed by the secondary communicative character of ritual, itsnature as a representation or imitation of ordinary communication. Inessence, Tambiah elides all communicative functions (including ritual) intoone broad group, and then treats ritual as merely a somewhat unusualexample from this group:Now, if for the purposes of exposition we draw a crude distinction between‘ordinary’ communicational behaviour and ‘ritual’ behaviour (accepting ofcourse that both kinds are equally subject to cultural conventions), then wecould say (forgetting the problem of insincerity and lying) that ordinary acts‘express’ attitudes and feelings directly (e.g. crying denotes distress in oursociety) and ‘communicate’ that information to interacting persons (e.g. theperson crying wishes to convey to another his feeling of distress). Butritualized, conventionalized, stereotyped behavior is constructed in order toexpress and communicate, and is publicly construed as expressing and"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS16741Tambiah, “Performative Approach,” 124. In passing, it is worth noting Tambiah’sparenthetical “forgetting the problem of insincerity and lying.” One is reminded at onceof Jacques Derrida’s brilliant assault on John R. Searle’s neo-Austinian semiotics, in whichDerrida noted Searle’s presumption that a theory of language need not take into accountinsincerity, dishonesty, or humor, and pointed out that such exclusions eliminate a greatdeal of what makes language a human phenomenon. The Searle-Derrida debate took placein Glyph v. 1 and 2 (1977); Derrida’s essays have been reprinted, along with a summary ofSearle’s essay and an afterword by Derrida, in Jacques Derrida, Limited Inc (Evanston, IL:Northwestern University Press, 1988). In the same context, it is worth consideringUmberto Eco’s dictum that “semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everythingwhich can be used in order to lie,” A Theory of Semiotics (Bloomington: Indiana UniversityPress, 1976; reprint, Midland Books, 1979), 6ff. et passim. In a sense, one might argue thatTambiah’s entire approach falls to the ground on the basis of this parenthetical exclusion,because by “forgetting the problem of insincerity and lying” he makes unworkable theparallel between ritual and language.42Tambiah, “Performative Approach,” 124. Emphasis in the original.43Tambiah, “Performative Approach,” 124.communicating, certain attitudes congenial to an ongoing institutionalizedintercourse. Stereotyped conventions in this sense act at a second or furtherremove; they code not intentions but ‘simulations’ of intentions.41In other words “ordinary” communication represents “attitudes andfeelings,” while ritual communication represents representation. Tambiahsuggests that this secondary character of ritual has a purpose: it is not thatritual is “bad speech,” but rather that the limitations placed on ritual ascommunication enable it to communicate a broader sense of structure andorder:Rituals as conventionalized behaviour are not designed or meant to expressthe intentions, emotions, and states of mind of individuals in a direct,spontaneous, and ‘natural’ way. Cultural elaboration of codes consists in thedistancing from such spontaneous and intentional expressions becausespontaneity and intentionality are, or can be, contingent, labile, circumstan-tial, even incoherent or disordered.42A reader of the present work will immediately have noticed the hint ofwriting in this “representation of a representation” formulation, whichsounds suspiciously like Saussure or Jakobson in their attacks on writing.Let us be clear about Tambiah’s logocentrism:Thus distancing is the other side of the coin of conventionality; distancingseparates the private emotions of the actors from their commitment to apublic morality. In a positive sense, it enables the cultural elaboration of thesymbolic; but in a negative sense it also contributes to hypocrisy, and thesubversion of transparent honesty.43"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR168I would like to propose a written solution to the problem of ritual—thatritual communication can be understood as writing, and further is oftenbetter understood as writing. Given the necessary brevity of the presentdiscussion, I cannot formulate all the possible details and ramifications ofsuch a written theory. Instead, I would like to use DOP to make thisdemonstration: my analysis of DOP ’s ritual magic will combine DOP ’swriting-dominated semiotics with this theory of ritual as writing. Insofaras this theoretical basis brings to light interesting and valuable conclusions,about DOP and about ritual, I hope that I will have demonstrated thepotential worth of a written theory of ritual. For the moment, let me simplysketch one possible direction for such a theory, and then move directly onto DOP ’s ritual magic.The Problem of FalsificationThe problem of falsification is one of the oldest questions in the historiogra-phy of magic: why does the magician (or the magician’s audience) not noticethat the magic materially fails to operate? As we saw in chapter one, thereare numerous classic answers to this question, from Frazer’s magician-as-illusionist theory to Malinowski’s theory of magic as catharsis.Tambiah’s suggestion is that the magic does operate, but that theoperation is linguistic rather than material. Specifically, he proposes thatrituals operate in a linguistic sphere, more or less mapped upon the materialsphere but not its equivalent; thus while there may be material effectsdescribed by the linguistic operations of ritual, one should not assume thatthe ritual is supposed by the natives to cause those effects materially. Inother words, ritual affects the linguistic, semiotic, discursive sphere, in wayswhich usually parallel the material effects rhetorically ascribed to the ritual;this parallelism, and the natives’ awareness of it, should not be taken tomean that the natives think the ritual has material effects. Since discursiveefficacy is not commonly demonstrable by the anthropologist, and materialefficacy has been divorced from the efficacy of the ritual per se, it isimpossible to say whether a given ritual “works” or not.As a privileged case in point, Tambiah identifies in native theories aboutword-magic:three notions which form an interrelated set: deities or first ancestors or theirequivalents instituted speech and the classifying activity; man himself is the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS16944Tambiah, “Power of Words,” 184.45Tambiah, “Power of Words,” 188.creator and user of this propensity; finally, language as such has an independ-ent existence and has the power to influence reality.44Tambiah notes an old theory of magic as based on a non-recognition of thearbitrary character of language, and it is this theory he proposes to uproot:And if it can be demonstrated that primitive magic is based on true relationalmetaphorical thinking we shall explode the classical theory which postulatesthat magic is based on the belief in a real identity between word and thing.The basic fallacy of linguists and philosophers who search for the origins ofthe magical attitude to words is their prior assumption and acceptance thatthe primitive has in fact such an attitude. . . . It would perhaps have been saferfor the linguists to have held fast to their knowledge of how language worksand to have questioned whether anthropologists had correctly reportedprimitive thought.45I do not question Tambiah’s success in finding “true relational metaphoricalthinking” in the cultures he analyzes; like him, I think it would be strangeindeed if he did not find such thinking. At the same time, Tambiah hasfallen into a fallacy as deep as (if perhaps safer than) that into which the“linguists and philosophers” fell. If the “classical theory” postulates adistinction between “true” metaphorical thinking and “the denotativefallacy” of confusing metaphorical relations for ontological identities,Tambiah upholds this distinction by denying that natives could possiblythink that way. For him, this is a defense of the natives—they do not thinkin such a “primitive” fashion. I suggest that Tambiah’s approach is moregenerous but no less misguided than that of his predecessors: the natives, bywhich I mean human beings in general, most certainly do think in this“primitive” way. Where both Tambiah and his predecessors go wrong is inthinking that the denotative fallacy is something we moderns have gottenpast. For Tambiah’s straw men (Ogden and Richards, Izutsu, Cassirer), thenatives think this way, therefore they are primitive and superstitious; forTambiah, the natives are not primitive or superstitious, therefore they donot think this way.As we have seen with Agrippa, however, one need not be primitive orsuperstitious to consider the possibility of signs ontologically attached totheir referents. On the contrary, one can perhaps argue that Tambiah’stheory presumes an ontological connection between the producer and the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR170sign, a more subtle but no less dangerous superstition. If we supposeinstead, as did early modern linguistic thinkers, that written signs standmore or less autonomous with respect to both producer and referent, butthat under certain circumstances this autonomy can be attenuated (e.g. aphotograph vs. a stick-figure), then we have the basis of a written semiotic.If we further apply this to ritual “language,” we produce a number ofsurprising effects.First, ritual actors—priests, dancers, participant-audience, etc.—arenormally distinct from the parts, roles, and meanings which they expressbodily and vocally. That is, the stereotyped or conventional character ofritual behavior does not constitute a disjuncture between ritual communica-tion and the “ordinary” mode (here the written), but a continuity.Conversely, the entirety of the ritual’s audience, which also includes all theparticipants, must be understood as interpreters, as readers, who interactwith the text in a more or less distant and abstract fashion: the text isautonomous.Second, the continual drive towards accuracy of repetition, the desire toperform the ritual just the way one’s ancestors did, appears as a necessaryartifact of the non-physicality of ritual’s medium. To put it more simply,writing in the ordinary sense is impressed upon a physical, lasting medium,such as paper, wood, bone, stone, metal. Without any necessary interven-tion by human actors (except negatively, to avoid destroying the book), thetext will survive indefinitely. Ritual, however, is written in a medium(people, objects, spoken words, actions) which is not physically lasting; assuch, it is incumbent upon knowledgeable practitioners, as librarians ofritual texts, to preserve the texts without alteration. Ritual stereotypy andrepetition neatly parallels the Brahminical memorization arts, by whichsemi-oral texts are subdivided, despite an a p p a r e n t l o s s o f m e a n i n g , p r e c i s e l yin order to preserve meaning.Third, in the ordinary course of culture ritual tends to become ontolo-gized, to be treated as a singular object rather than a series of discrete andd i s t i n c t p e r f o r m a n c e s .

Just so Mass is Mass, a Christening aChristening, a Bris a Bris; the specific actors and details are irrelevant.46Let me make a final point, which will become clearer over the course ofthe analysis of DOP ’s ritual magic. Tambiah, as noted above, equates magicwith ritual. At the same time, he makes certain qualifications to thisequation that call into question its entire basis. The most striking suchqualification is in Tambiah’s assessment of divination:Obviously such ritual enactments as various forms of divination, astrologicalconsultations, mediumistic sessions do not predict their outcomes in advance,yet their ordering is so different from the uncertainties of a game. For theyhave as their aim the enabling of the client to effect a cure or a reconciliation,to make a decision, to avoid a danger, and in this sense the object of theexercise is to make a fruitful exchange between the occult and the human viathe mediation of the officiant, a fruitful conjunction that will help to producean orderly ongoing social existence.47Having argued that magic and rituals are in essence rigged games, appearingundecided and in doubt while in fact not open to differences, Tambiah goeson to tell us that a primary form of magical behavior—divination—must beexcluded from the category, precisely because the outcome is indeed indoubt. Or rather, he continues, because ritual is necessarily predetermined,it must be the case that the divinatory, “finding-out” aspect of divination isnot important—what is important is that the client and the diviner have anice chat which makes the client feel better!Allow me to point out the simplicity of a written solution: the diviner isa professional reader. Random chance—defined culturally as god, gods,spirits, nature, the dead—produces a complex sign, of whose interpretationthe client probably has very little knowledge. The reader, using a culturallydetermined canon of interpretive techniques, texts, images, and myths,reads the text, taking into account what he or she knows of the client’ssituation. In a way, it is surprising that this theory has not been proposedbefore, given that every Western form of divination known to me uses theterminology of “reading.”"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR17248DOP I:2, 87-88/6.49In early modern magic, “theurgy” generally means the manipulation of angels andangelic celestial beings.50De vanitate 45, 94-95130-31.Ritual, Belief, and SecrecyRitual or ceremonial magic is the focus of Book III; unfortunately, as shouldbe clear from our discussions of “magic” and “ritual,” it is unclear whatexactly “ritual magic” would mean. DOP provides a number of definitions,as does De vanitate, and before turning to the main body of Book III someexplication of definitions is in order.The first definition in DOP is in Book I, chapter 2, on kinds of magic,and gives a general outline:Now theological philosophy, or divinity, teacheth what God is, what themind, what an intelligence, what an angel, what a devil, what the soul, whatreligion, what sacred institutions, rites, temples, observations, and sacredmysteries are: it instructs us also concerning faith, miracles, the virtues ofwords and figures, the secret operations and mysteries of seals, and as Apuleiussaith, it teacheth us rightly to understand, and to be skilled in the ceremoniallaws, the equity of holy things, and rule of religions.48Two more definitions appear in chapters 45-46 of De vanitate, on “Goetia”and “Theurgy:”49Now the parts of ceremonial magic are goetia and theurgy. Goetia is unfortunate, by the commerces of unclean spirits made up of therites of wicked curiosities, unlawful charms, and deprecations, and isabandoned and execrated by all laws. . . . And all these [practitioners of goetia] proceed two ways. For some endea-vor to call and compel evil spirits, adjuring by a certain power, especially ofdivine names. . . . [T]here are [also] some that are most impiously wickedindeed, that submit themselves to devils, sacrifice to, and adore them, andthereby become guilty of idolatry, and the basest abasement: to which crimesif the former are not obnoxious, yet they expose themselves to manifestdangers. For even compelled devils always deceive us whithersoever they go.50Now many think that theurgy is not unlawful, as if this be governed bygood angels, and a divine deity, when as yet oftentimes it is under the nameso f G o d , a n d t h e f a l l a c i e s o f e v i l a n g e l s o b s t r i n g e d b y t h e w i c k e d f a l l a c i e s o f t h edevils."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS17351De vanitate 46, 97/134.52There is no need to distinguish between “ceremonial magic” and “religious magic”in DOP; both terms occur, the former far more often, and they appear to be equivalent.53DOP III:e.d., 399/435.54DOP III:3, 407/448; chapter not in W.For we do procure, and attract not by natural powers only, but also bycertain rites, and ceremonies, celestials, and by them divine virtues toourselves; of which together with many rules the ancient magicians did treatin many volumes.51There are in addition three important definitions early in Book III; the first,appearing in the dedicatory epistle to Archbishop Hermann von Wied,explains and defends the general purpose and function of ceremonialmagic52 as follows:But the knowledge of the divine science, doth only and very powerfullyp e r f o r m t h i s f o r u s .

A fewpoints are clear: First, ritual magic correctly performed elevates themagician “even to the Archetype himself.” Second, this same magic enablesthe magician to command all creatures, even the angels, and to workwonders or miracles in a divinely approved fashion. Third, practitioners ofritual magic often slip into diabolism and traffic with the infernal—demonic magic in the usual (non-Agrippan) sense. In the present section,we shall learn both why ritual magic is so potentially superior and holy, andhow it can so easily go bad.Secrecy and InitiationImmediately after these definitions, DOP moves on to the issue of secrecy.Whosoever therefore thou art that now desirest to study this science, keepsilent and constantly conceal within the secret closets of your religious breast,so holy a determination; for (as Mercurius [Trismegistus] says), to publish tothe knowledge of many a speech thoroughly filled with so great majesty of thedeity, is a sign of an irreligious spirit; and divine Plato commanded, that holyand secret mysteries should not be divulged to the people; Pythagoras also,and Porphyry consecrated their followers to a religious silence; Orpheus also,with a certain terrible authority of religion did exact an oath of silence fromthose he did initiate to the ceremonies of holy things.56Later in the same chapter, we read the following somewhat differentinjunction:Wherefore you will pardon me, if I pass over in silence many and the chiefestsecret mysteries of ceremonial magic. I suppose I shall do enough, if I openthose things which are necessary to be known, and you by the reading of thisbook go not away altogether empty of these mysteries; but on that conditionlet these things be communicated to you, on which Dionysius boundTimothy, that they which perceive these secrets, would not expose them to"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS 17557DOP III:2, 406/444; passage not in W.58DOP III:65, 599/677; passage not in W.the unworthy, but gather them together amongst wise men, and keep themwith that reverence that is due to them.57Secrecy is a common problem in magical texts; indeed, magical literature ispeppered with esoteric (in the simple sense) tropes. Several major types ofsecrecy, in two general classes, may be distinguished in DOP, and are fairlyrepresentative of the broader literature.First, in the latter of the two quoted passages, DOP describes itself asfilled with secrets that can only be discovered by the wise, a claim repeatedin the conclusion of the entire work:For we have delivered this art in such a manner, that it may not be hid fromthe prudent and intelligent, and yet may not admit wicked and incredulousmen to the mysteries of these secrets, but leave them destitute and astonished,in the shade of ignorance and desperation.58Here the “prudent and intelligent” can be understood as a twofold group.On the one hand, there are the initiates, whose prior knowledge of therelevant mysteries enables them to discern the truth hidden in the text. Onthe other hand, there are those sufficiently knowledgeable, wise, andreverent to discover the truth, but who have not yet been initiated; theimplication is that this latter group will become initiated by means of theirreading of DOP.Second, as in the first definition quoted, there is the injunction to thewise, whether previously initiated or initiated by study of DOP, not to reveal the truths they discover. This can be understood as a necessary corollary tothe notion of DOP as an initiatory text: those who become “the wise”through its study need to recognize the responsibilities attendant upon theirnew-found status.Such a rhetoric of hiddenness and initiation is extremely common inmagical texts, which has led to a tendency by certain scholars to equatemagic with esotericism. This move is parallel to Evans-Pritchard’s withrespect to witchcraft (see page 6 above), in that it shifts magical activity intothe realm of the social, where it is more obviously subject to sociological andanthropological analysis. While the parallels between DOP ’s rhetoric ofsecrecy and that of initiation cults are certainly noteworthy, however, thereare also interesting differences that require discussion."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR17659Ricoeur, “The Model of the Text,” 200-01. Note that this formulation grantsnormativity to speech and restricts writing to transcription; thus writing is more distantthat speech—Ricoeur refers to “this dissociation of the verbal meaning of the text and themental intention. . . .” The reader of the present work will not need warning thatAgrippa’s formulation could not possibly agree with Ricoeur’s.First, the idea of auto-initiation by means of a text is striking. Onepossible implication is a hermeneutics of authorial intent: if close study ofthe text can make the author—himself an initiate—present to the reader,then the reader can receive initiation under the guidance of a master. A more complex reading, and one which accords better with thesemiotics we have seen in Book II, is that the author is no less present in thetext than he would be in person; indeed, he may be more present, given DOP ’stendency to privilege written media. As such the hermeneutic theoryimplied here is not so much naive as cynical about the value of face-to-facecommunication.My sense is that this latter reading requires yet further complication. Inchapter one above (see page 19), I mentioned Paul Ricoeur’s notion of a“world in front of the text,” which I have employed in a manner not entirelyconsistent with what I take to be Ricoeur’s meaning. In particular, I havethroughout attempted to present DOP ’s understanding and analysis of aworld not the same as our own, a world in which the various metaphysicalprinciples discussed in DOP are accepted essentially at face value. Thepresent examination of the idea of secrecy and initiation, however, suggeststhat the focus on a world in front of DOP is not only a methodologicaldecision on my part, but also a precondition of DOP ’s argument.Let me clarify. A reader engages in a circular process—the hermeneuticcircle—of entering the text and then returning with meaning. The basichermeneutical problem, however, is that the meaning so generated is notequivalent to some absolute “meaning of the text”; that is, two differentreaders will construct two different meanings from the same text. AsRicoeur puts it rather nicely, “With written discourse, the author’s intentionand the meaning of the text cease to coincide. . . . Not that we can conceiveof a text without an author; the tie between the speaker and the discourse isnot abolished, but distended and complicated.”59 This has a great manyphilosophical ramifications. To summarize those of particular relevancehere: (1) no text has an absolute and fixed meaning; therefore (2) the authorof the text does not control what meaning the reader derives from it—theauthor of a text is absent, not present; (3) the ground upon which the readerengages with the text is not the world of the text but rather a world projected"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  17760Ricoeur, “The Model of the Text,” 201.61Ricoeur, “The Model of the Text,” 202.in front of it; therefore (4) the text under analysis is, in some sense, a textprojected by the reader.“Discourse . . . is what refers to the world, to a world. In spokendiscourse this means that what the dialogue ultimately refers to is thesituation common to the interlocutors.”60 Therefore the text can only pointto some world in front of the text, a world in whose creation the readerparticipates as a dominant factor. An alternative construction, however,would suggest that spoken discourse is limited to a specific world, the worldof the interlocutors; as such, it can fail to refer effectively, in that theinterlocutors might disagree entirely about what worlds are legitimateobjects of discourse. Written texts, on the other hand, are unfettered by thebonds of the now, indeed by the bonds of reality. As such, DOP can refervalidly and coherently to a world whose characteristics do not match anyworld described by modern science without thereby being designated a“fantasy.” On the contrary, the absence of an authorial presence entails thatit is the duty of the reader to move toward the projected world in front of thetext and not simply dismiss the text. To the extent that the reader canformulate the world in which the text is most fully meaningful, it is perhapsarguable that the text has succeeded in projecting (one of) its meaning(s):. . . [W]hat we understand first in a discourse is not another person, but aproject, that is, the outline of a new being-in-the-world. Only writing, infreeing itself, not only from its author, but from the narrowness of thedialogical situation, reveals this destination of discourse as projecting aworld.61Although the terminology is modern, these principles were known toRenaissance thinkers in the same way, and from the same sources, as theyknew about the arbitrary nature of the sign. Given DOP ’s sophisticationwith regard to the sign, we cannot suppose that problems of text and readerare dealt with simplistically; what is more, the theory of analog significationin Book II must be taken into account when trying to understand thehermeneutics of Book III.We have seen that the various injunctions to secrecy imply that a readerof DOP can become initiated through its study. Furthermore we knowfrom Book II that a sign can be motivated to such a degree that it has adominating or controlling effect on the world, and we learned in Book I that"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR17862This construction of written signs is at odds with Ricoeur’s formulation that the“material fixation” of discourse—for him the main purpose of writing—requires us to“concede that the perlocutionary act is the least inscribable aspect of discourse and that bypreference it characterises spoken language” (Ricoeur, “Model of the Text,” 199-200). Atbase, Ricoeur’s assumption is that writing’s function is to fix spoken discourse in a materialform, which implies that writing is dominated by the locutionary and to a lesser degree theillocutionary, while the perlocutionary remains outside writing’s normal sphere. Given thedirections in which DOP has led us, we must admit that this assumption can be challenged.Ricoeur’s assumption can be rephrased in entirely logocentric terms: he thinks thatwriting’s function is limited to the transcription of speech. But if writing can havefunctions and effects not coterminous with the structure of speech-acts, it must equally begranted that writing may have perlocutionary (or per-grammatical) function, power, and force.human minds may be dominated or controlled in this way. What is impliedhere is that DOP is itself a sufficiently powerful sign that it can control itsreaders and impose initiation upon them; in other words, the reader isforced to understand in a certain way, such that the meaning derived fromreading the text is fixed.62Nevertheless DOP does not seem to have this effect on all readers, butonly on the “wise.” This leads to an extremely important conclusion: thepower of a magical sign to affect a human mind is dependent on that mind’sunderstanding of the sign.We have already seen one example of this in our discussion of hierog-lyphs (page 127). Hieroglyphs were understood as priestly, secret writing,comprehensible only to the initiated. An Egyptian priest, immensely welleducated about all things sacred, would look at the ouroboros hieroglyph andunderstand at once the complex notion of the universe compressed into it.Most importantly for our present discussion, the priest need not alreadyknow this particular sign to understand it, for he can derive its meaningfrom his knowledge of allegorical interpretation, animals, divinity, and soforth. A layperson, however, would be unable to make such a leap ofinterpretation, not having the foundation of knowledge required. Themagical power of the sign to project its meaning thus depends upon theinterpreter’s prior initiation.Secrecy and SuperstitionThis hermeneutical understanding of the injunctions to secrecy aidconsiderably in understanding the first portion of Book III, particularlychapters 2 through 13, which link secrecy with belief, faith, and operativepower:"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS17963DOP III:2, 406/444; does not appear in W.64DOP III:4, 409-12/450-51.65DOP III:4, 411/451, passage not in W.[E]ven as the divine powers detest public things and profane, and love secrecy;so every magical experiment fleeth the public, seeks to be hid, is strengthenedby silence, but is destroyed by publication, neither doth any complete effectfollow after; all these things suffer loss, when they are poured into prating andincredulous minds; therefore it behoveth a magical operator, if he would getfruit from this art, to be secret, and to manifest to none, neither his work norplace, nor time, neither his desire nor will, unless either to a master, orpartner, or companion, who also ought to be faithful, believing, silent, anddignified by nature and education: seeing that even the prating of a compan-ion, his incredulity and unworthiness, hindereth and disturbeth the effect inevery operation.63This discussion of secrecy, belief and credulity reaches its peak in chapter 4,which treats “Of the two helps of ceremonial magic, religion and supersti-tion.”64 The distinction between these two is simple enough: “All worship. . . which is different from the true religion, is superstition;” not surpris-ingly, we are instructed to avoid superstition and cleave to true religion. Atthe same time, superstition “is not all and wholly rejected,” because it has “acertain resemblance to religion,” because the various pagan authorities wereinevitably not believers in the true religion, and because there are certainsuperstitious practices which the church tolerates, such as “when worms andlocusts are excommunicated . . . [and] when bells and images are baptized,and such like.”DOP goes quite a bit further, however, in arguing that superstition hasits place:Whosoever . . . in his religion, though false, yet believeth most stronglythat it is true, and elevates his spirit by reason of this his credulity, until it beassimilated to those spirits who are the chief leaders of that religion, may workthose things which nature and reason discern not; but incredulity anddiffidence doth weaken every work not only in superstition, but also in truereligion, and enervates the desired effect even of the most strongexperiments.65The extension of this argument fits neatly into Faivre’s category of “thepraxis of concordance,” i.e. the theory that there is a truth behind allreligions, such that the practice of establishing common denominatorsamong several systems is understood to produce illumination.

Inaddition to the standard story of Moses’s secret teachings to the seventy orseventy-two wise men, Reuchlin in De arte cabalistica had traced aKabbalistic lineage from Adam through Abraham, Moses, the prophets, anddown to modern times, in which each important Kabbalistic patriarch wasinstructed by a specific angel: “Our fathers’ teachers were famous angels. Raziel was Adam’s.” By thewill of God this angel showed him the path to atonement. He gave Adamdivine words, to be interpreted allegorically, in the way of Kabbalah.

In addition,the secret character of that lore furthers the strength of its practitioners’belief, because it is not “poured into prating and incredulous minds.”Thus in DOP the force of any occult practice depends on four factors,two analytical and two practical. On the analytical side, the accuracy andvalidity of a practice is established by (1) comparison and (2) chronol-ogy—comparison to other forms of prisca magia, chronology of transmis-sion. On the practical side, the crucial elements are (1) belief and (2)secrecy.

Hidden within this apparently orthodox formulation—theidea that one can be swallowed up by ecstatic communion with thedivine—is the far more radical notion that demonic magic is necessary forthe safety of the Christian magician: magic performed in light of true faithrequires the use of mediating forces, “the mixture of other powers,” if themagus is not to be destroyed by the purity of his own practice.Seeing that the being and operation of all things, depend on the most highGod, Creator of all things, from thence also on the other divine powers, towhom also is granted a power of fashioning and creating, not principallyindeed, but instrumentally by virtue of the First Creator . . . it is necessarytherefore that every magician know that very God . . . and also the other gods,or divine powers (which we call the second causes). . . .74 The most important such divine powers or second causes are the divinenames and emanations, i.e. the sefirot, which in DOP are equivalent to thepagan gods correctly understood.God himself, though he be Trinity in persons, yet is but one only simpleessence; notwithstanding we doubt not but that there are in him many divinepowers, which as beams flow from him, which the philosophers of the gentilescall gods, the Hebrew masters numerations, we name attributes.75Thus the use of Orphic hymns and other pagan invocations of the gods isnot fundamentally dissimilar to the worship of God in some particularaspect—God the Father, God who parted the Red Sea, God who sparedIsaac, etc. The orthodoxy of any such invocation depends upon thepractitioner’s faith and understanding: so long as the magician believes inthe true faith, and furthermore knows that in his invocation Mercury issimply the divine aspect of understanding, as is the sefirah Binah (hnyb), hismagical practice avoids idolatry.

The majority of chapter 13 discusses the partsand members of God, i.e. Kabbalistic meditations called Shi’ur Komah, themeasure of the body.81 In the final portion of the chapter, such speculationsare related to the doctrine of man as imago Dei: These members therefore in God are like to ours, but the Ideas and exemplarsof our members, to the which if we rightly conform our members, then beingtranslated into the same image, we are made the true sons of God, and like toGod, doing and working the works of God.82The implication is clear: through meditation, contemplation, and ritualinvocation of the divine aspects, the magician’s soul and body come toconform with increasing exactitude to the nature of the divine, untileventually the magician becomes a “true son of God” and a miracle-worker.These claims are not unorthodox, and fall easily within a broad spectrumof mystical literature, Christian and Jewish alike. Insofar as DOP ’sdiscussion of the need for “other powers” can be understood to refer to thisascent through the divine names, its apparent radicalism is annulled. At thesame time, it is important to note that the analysis of the hierarchies ofministering angels and stars occurs in between these other two discussions.Let us recall Moshe Idel’s description of two explanatory models forKabbalistic magic: on the one hand, the magician may work more or lessecstatically, the practical effect of his techniques being elevation of the soultowards the divine nature; on the other, magical techniques may beemployed to draw down power from the sefirot. Given our analysis of DOPin general, it seems clear that both forms are present here: the use of magicaltechniques to achieve mystical ends is formulated quite explicitly, but thediscussion of angelic hierarchies implies that the same techniques may drawdown power."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  18583Note that the Oration itself was not particularly well-known in the sixteenth century:see Farmer, Syncretism in the West, 18-19 et passim.84Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man, trans.

Let us disdain earthly things, despise heavenly things, and, finally,esteeming less whatever is of the world, hasten to that court which is beyondthe world and nearest to the Godhead.

First, thetechniques assist the soul’s cleaving to God, purifying and elevating themagician toward the divine. Second, through such elevation, the magiciangains power over the angels and ministering forces, and can manipulatethem to produce worldly effects. The higher the magician rises through thespheres and the divine world, the more powerful the angels which can bethus manipulated; furthermore (as we shall see) such manipulation bindsthe magician to the superior nature of the angels, aiding further ascent. Bylinking these two functions, DOP consecrates magic: no magician cancontrol spirits whose status is higher than his own, therefore the manipula-tion of angels is both proof of purity and an instrument for achieving divineunion.

Unlike many contemporaryworks enamored of Kabbalistic knowledge, DOP grants Hebrew only alimited priority. Indeed, the claim here is that the angels speak to us byimpressing their meaning upon us:[M]any think that if they use any idiom, it is Hebrew, because that was thefirst of all, and came from heaven, and was before the confusion of languages.. . . But now how angels speak it is hid from us, as they themselves are. . . .

So souls going out of the body, so angels, sodemons speak: and what man doth with a sensible voice, they do byimpressing the conception of the speech in those to whom they speak, aftera better manner than if they should express it by an audible voice.85Although the connection is not made explicit, it would appear that thismeans of communication parallels the way in which demons are themselvesnamed: Adam imposed names on the angels in the same way as he namedthe animals. The logical conclusion is striking, and strengthens our earlierreading that a magician’s dominance over angels is a normal extension of thedignification produced by true ceremonial magic:Hence the Hebrew mecubals86 think, together with magicians, that it is in thepower of man to impose names upon spirits, but of such a man only who isdignified, and elevated to this virtue by some divine gift, or sacred authority.87"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS18788Such comparisons, which would require linguistic expertise beyond my own, mightgo some way toward solving a rather vexed problem with regard to Agrippa’sKabbalah—that is, how much Hebrew he knew, and from what sources (textual andpersonal) he learned Hebrew and Kabbalah. Some of the groundwork for such analysis hasbeen laid by Chaim Wirszubski in Pico della Mirandola’s Encounter with Jewish Mysticism.89DOP III:25, 472-81/538-46: “Quomodo Hebraeorum mecubales sacra angelorumnomina e Sacris Scripturis eliciant atque de septuaginta duobus angelis qui ferunt nomenDei cum tabulis Ziruph et commutationum literarum et numerorum.”90There are 72 letters in each of the three verses. To extract the 72 names, write thefirst verse on a line forwards, then the second on the next line backwards, and the thirdverse on the next line forwards again, so that you have 72 columns of three letters each.To each three-letter root, add an angelic suffix ( e.g. hy, l)), producing 72 names.91Psalm 35:5-6, Revised Standard Version and Stuttgart Hebrew Bible.For most purposes, however, the names of demons are handed down bytradition, derived in some fashion from Scripture, or simply names of theoffices or functions which the demons serve. Chapters 24 through 31discuss such names, with numerous examples. Unlike the magic squaresdiscussion in II:22, there are few ordered lists of mysterious and arcane-appearing names; on the contrary, these chapters discuss how to deriveangelic names from other known facts. There is a good deal of technicalmaterial here, deserving comparative analysis with Kabbalistic texts.88 T h ecomplexity and detail of such a study, considering the entire eight chapterswith reference to parallels in Book II especially, would require a work ofcomparable size to the present study. For our purposes, and as an exampleof the fascinating material found in these chapters, I simply discuss a singlechapter and a single set of issues which arise from it.Chapter 25 is entitled, “How the Hebrew mecubals drew forth the sacrednames of angels out of sacred writ, and of the seventy-two angels, which bearthe name of God, with the tables of Ziruph, and the commutations of lettersand numbers.” 89 As indicated in its title, the chapter discusses how to deriveangelic and demonic names from the Hebrew texts of scripture, particularlythe Shemhamphoras, by which seventy-two names emerge from Exodus14:19-21.90 As an example, verses 5 and 6 of “the 35 psalm with theHebrews, but with us the 34,” read:91Let them be like chaff before thewind, with the angel of the Lorddriving them on!.hxwd hwhy K)lmw xwr-ynplCmk wyhyLet their way be dark and slip-pery, with the angel of the Lordpursuing them!twqlqlxw K#x Mkrd-yhy .Mpdr hwhy K)lmw"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR18892Scholem, Kabbalah, 337.93Blaise de Vigenère, Traicté des chiffres (Paris, 1586), 46r-49v.Each verse contains a specific reference to an angel, a mal’ak (K)lm),and by taking the first letters of the words describing each angel we get threeletters, to which we then add the angelic-name suffix el (l)) to produce theangel’s name.

[Apart from the previous methods there are] those which are extracted bythe tables of Ziruph, and the tables of commutations, of which we mademention above. And because these tables serve for all names, as well divine,as angelical, we shall therefore subjoin them to this chapter.First, note that z.iruf (Prc) is a Hebrew word meaning “to refine,” and inAgrippa’s usage it refers to a type of gematria. Before going on, a few wordsof explanation of gematria are necessary. We have seen that gematria oftenmeans simply the Hebrew numerical system in which alef ) = 1, bet. b = 2,and so forth. More broadly, however, gematria “consists of explaining aword or group of words [of Scripture] according to the numerical value ofthe letters, or of substituting other letters of the alphabet for them inaccordance with a set system.”92 The latter sort, based on substitution, iscalled temurah, and an example occurs in Jeremiah (25:26 and 51:41),where the prophet speaks of the city of Sheshak (k##). Each letter istransformed by counting how far into the alphabet it occurs, such that alefis one, bet two, and so forth, and then replaced by the letter an equivalentdistance from the end of the alphabet, so that alef becomes tov, bet becomesshin, and so forth. When applied to the name Sheshak, this is revealed to bebavel (lbb), or Babylon.Agrippa’s z.iruf table (figure 10) can be read cryptographically in thefollowing manner. The top line gives the Hebrew alphabet, from right toleft, in order. Each line below shifts one place to the left, wrapping the extraletters over to the right side.The usual name for this cipher is the Vigenère cipher, named for Blaisede Vigenère, who is often thought of as having invented it in 1586 in hisTraicté des chiffres.93 I have never seen Agrippa mentioned in the context of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  189Figure 10.

As such, cryptography and esoteric-ism in the broad sense are allied fields.But scholarly analysis of Trithemius’s books on cryptography remainsmainly divided into two radically opposed camps, one claiming thatTrithemius’s cryptography is “really” magic, and the other that Trithemius’smagic is “really” cryptography.The debate centers on Steganographia: Hoc est, ars per occultam scripturamanimi sui voluntatem absentibus aperienda certa [Secret Writing: that is, aReliable Art of Opening Your Mind’s Purpose to Absent People Througha Disguised Message], written circa 1500, which circulated in manuscriptthroughout the sixteenth century but was first published in 1606.As an example of the contents of Steganographia, the work opens with amode of sending messages by compelling the “malicious and untrustwor-thy” spirit Pamersiel. To do this, first invoke the Trinity, then transcribethe message, being sure to face East; the spirit is compelled by means of aformula beginning, “Pamersiel oshurmy delmuson Thafloin peanocharustea melany. . . .” The recipient, who must also be adept in this art,faces East and recites a formula beginning “Lamarton anoyr bulon madriseltraschon. . . .” This will make the sender’s message crystal-clear to therecipient’s mind. It is important that one include the name or sign of thecommunicating spirit (here Pamersiel), and not send plaintext (anundisguised message).The strange formulae, demonic names, and the various other fascinatingmagical systems in Steganographia can be understood cryptographically.Apparently the first printed decryptions which refer explicitly to"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS19195Würzburg, 1665.96Naples, 1563 and 1602.97Wayne Shumaker deciphers the message, beginning “Lucidum jubar aeternaeBeatitudinis,” as meaning “Dear Faithful One: You will be armed as best you can nextMonday and about five will wait for us at the gate; we will appear there with ourfollowers.” The apparent content of the message, i.e. the ciphertext, begins “Brightradiance of the eternal Blessedness, most excellent King, most strong governor and defenderof all who live virtuously, refuge of exiles. . . ;” Renaissance Curiosa (Binghamton, NY:Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies, 1982), 101-02.Trithemius’s book occur in Gaspar Schott’s Schola steganographica,95 butalready in Giambattista della Porta’s De furtivis literarum notis96 systemsequivalent to some of Trithemius’s had appeared; in addition, some of theSteganographia manuscript copies had been accompanied by a Clavis, likelycomposed by Trithemius himself.The “Pamersiel” message is one of the simplest to decipher. The firstword is simply the name of the demon, also in a sense the name of thedeciphering system, so that the recipient knows how to go about decryption.The rule of “Pamersiel” is to eliminate every other, starting with words andthen moving to letters. That is, delete every other word, beginning with thefirst, then from the remaining words delete every other letter, againbeginning with the first:Lamarton anoyr bulon madrisel traschon ebrasothea panthenon nabrulgesCamery itrasbier rubanthy nadres Calmosy ormenu lan ytules demy rabionhamorphyn.anoyr madrisel ebrasothea nabrulges itrasbier nadres ormenu ytules rabionnym die ersten bugstaben de omny uerboIn other words, “Take the first letters of every word.” The actual messagewhich accompanies the formula will therefore be encrypted by the systemdescribed in the formula.97A great number of such systems appear in Steganographia and the laterPolygraphia, some of them extremely sophisticated, some (like the Pamersielsystem) very simple. Some will produce a message which, like the formulaabove, appears to be gibberish; others produce a perfectly comprehensiblebut irrelevant message.

But if we turn back to DOPIII:25, where Agrippa gives cryptographic tables in his discussion of angelicnames, we are led to a conclusion which annuls the whole basis of theargument. If we choose not to be “ungenerous and indiscreet,” there is noreason to think that Agrippa did not know what he was talking about, northat he skewed his old master’s teachings in a way which would be entirelyunacceptable to the latter. Agrippa’s interpretation, then, is that crypto-graphic systems are themselves magical ones, in the same way that mathe-matics, astronomy, and natural philosophy are fundamental building blocksof occult philosophy. In other words, one cannot distinguish absolutelybetween cryptography and magic, and tacking on the apotropaic “natural”does not change matters—indeed, the placement of z.iruf in Book IIIindicates that in DOP, such cryptography is not natural but rather religiousor ceremonial magic.Prophecy, Frenzy, and EcstasyChapters 45 through 52 discuss “soothsaying and frenzy” (vaticinium etfuror), by which “oracles and spirits descend from the gods or from thedemons upon the magician.106 This is one of the highest forms of ceremo-nial magic, because the soul becomes aligned to and strengthened by thedemon which enters it.

There are three major forms: frenzy (ofwhich there are four kinds), ecstasy, and oracle. The majority of DOP ’sdiscussion focuses on the types of frenzy, and I follow that emphasis here.In frenzy, the higher aspects of the soul (mind and intellect especially) areabstracted from the senses, and rise into the heavens to the divine. Eachkind of frenzy has a particular effect on the soul, making it more like thedivine in some specific manner. Thus the several frenzies constitute a risingseries, or rather, a set of rungs on the ladder up to God.The first kind of frenzy proceeds from the Muses, “the souls of thecelestial spheres,” and thus there are nine degrees parallel to the nine spheres(seven heavenly bodies, fixed stars, and primum mobile).107 The briefdescriptions of each degree generally refer back to Books I and II, where thenatural and celestial objects and structures favorable to each sphere weredetailed. There is very little detail here. It appears that each form of frenzyinduces the soul to rise to the appropriate sphere, which suggests a kind ofcourse of nine degrees, at the end of which the magician’s soul would beattuned to the primum mobile.Dionysian frenzy, the second kind, “doth . . . divert the soul into themind, the supreme part of itself, and makes it a fit and pure temple of thegods, in which the divine spirits may dwell.”108 The divine spirits here areangels in the narrow and superior sense, such as Michael, Uriel, Raziel, andso forth; such angels sometimes speak prophecy through human mouths.Dionysian frenzy is produced “by expiations exterior, and interior, bysolemnities, rites, temples, and observations . . .” (although few details aregiven), and by it “the soul . . . is filled . . . with felicity, wisdom, and oracles.. . .”109The third kind of frenzy “proceeds from Apollo, viz. from the mind ofthe world. This doth . . . make the soul rise above the mind, by joining itwith deities, and demons.”110 The primary purposes of this art are toproduce prophecy and intellectual wisdom, here seemingly equated:We read . . . that Rabbi Johena, the son of Jochahad, did after that manner [byritual techniques to bring on Apollonian frenzy] enlighten a certain rudecountryman, called Eleazar, being altogether illiterate, that being compassedabout with a sudden brightness, did unexpectedly preach such high mysteries"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS195111DOP III:48, 550/623.112DOP III:49, 553/627.113DOP III:45, 545/616, citing II Peter 1:21.of the Law to an assembly of wise men, that he did even astonish all that werenear him.111The final kind of frenzy is that of Venus, “and it doth by a fervent loveconvert, and transmute the mind to God, and makes it altogether like toGod, as it were the proper image of God.”112 The knowledge communi-cated to the soul by this frenzy transcends prophecy and moves towardsdivine knowledge: “the soul being so converted into God . . . doth besidethat it hath . . . obtained the spirit of prophecy, sometimes work wonderfulthings, and greater than the nature of the world can do, which works arecalled miracles.” It is essential that DOP is specific about the miraculousnature of the powers of the Venus-frenzied soul: “such a man is moreexcellent than they that are in heaven, or at least equal to them.” By thishighest form of frenzy, the soul rises to the pinnacle of heaven.It is not explicit that the lower degrees and kinds of frenzy are prerequi-sites for the higher, but the structure of the discussion supports such areading. The cycle of nine Muses rises through the nine celestial spheres,which are rational/intellectual, while Dionysian frenzy “divert[s] the soulinto the mind.” There is thus excellent reason to think that the frenzies area graded sequence, raising the soul through the spheres, into the layers of thedivine, and finally to God himself.None of this discussion is apparently unorthodox; prophecy and divinefrenzy are well-attested in Christian literature from the Bible onwards, andDOP carefully cites the apostle Peter.113 A t the sa m e ti m e, w e m u st b ea r i nmind that DOP discusses such frenzy as part of ceremonial magic. Inessence, the claim is that divine frenzy and ecstasy are produced by the verytechniques—elevated to their highest forms, to be sure—of demonic magic!The logical and structural continuity of the chapters on angelic nameswith those on frenzy thus constructs a radical thesis in an apparentlyorthodox manner. If it is granted that the highest form of prophecy (not tomention the working of miracles) is caused by the indwelling of the HolySpirit in a human soul, and that lesser forms of prophecy are caused by asimilar indwelling of angels, then we can logically extend this progressiondownwards to ordinary demonic powers. Therefore ceremonial magic,which aims primarily to contact and manipulate demonic beings, is simplya general category at the apex of which is a kind of sainthood. Furthermore"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR196114DOP III:e.d., 399/435.115De vanitate 46, 97-98/134.116DOP III:53, 563-64/639.the most straightforward means to achieve this highest of ends is to workone’s way up the chain, i.e. to begin by contacting the lower orders ofdemons (not infernal ones, naturally), then work up to the Lunar Muse, andso on up to God.PurificationThe great danger of demonic magic, of course, is that it is not always clearwhich sort of demons one is contacting—angelic or diabolic. [T]hose that neglect [contemplation of the divine], trusting only to naturaland worldly things, are wont often to be confounded by divers errors andfallacies, and very oft to be deceived by evil spirits; but the understanding ofdivine things purgeth the mind from errors, and rendereth it divine, givethinfallible power to our works, and driveth far the deceits and obstacles of allevil spirits, and together subjects them to our commands.114Thus the principal means by which to avoid the deceptions of evil demonsis divine contemplation. To this are added various means of ritualpurification, whose analysis takes up the final chapters of DOP.But the greatest part of all ceremonies consists in observing cleanliness, andpurity, first of the mind, then of the body, and of those things which are aboutthe body. . . . Now impurity, because it oftentimes infects the air, and man,disturbs that most pure influence of celestial and divine things, and chasethaway the pure spirits of God. But sometimes impure spirits, and deceivingpowers, that they be worshipped, and adored for gods, require also this purity.Therefore here is great need of caution. . . .115One crucial purpose of purification, then, is to ensure the goodness andpurity of any demons summoned. At the same time, chapters 53 through64 harp on purification for another reason, more in keeping with thediscussion of frenzy and ecstasy: purity of body and especially of mind notonly enables divine instruction but causes it. “A human soul therefore whenit be rightly purged, and expiated, doth then, being loosed from all impurity. . . instruct itself. . . .”116The theory behind this is similar to that which we saw in frenzy:"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS197117DOP III:55, 570/644, passage not in W.118DOP III:63, 587/668.119DOP III:63, 588/668.120DOP III:63, 587-88/668, quoting Exodus 23:20-21.121DOP III:63, 589-90/669.For by how much the more we have relinquished the animal and the humanlife, by so much the more we live like angels, and God, to which beingconjoined, and brought into a better condition, we have power over all things,ruling over all.117It is in this lengthy survey of purity and purification that, at last, we see someaspects of ritual technique and theory spelled out clearly. Since purityinduces divinity, as it were, it follows that “the greatest part of all ceremoniesconsists in observing cleanliness, and purity. . . .” The majority of thediscussion of purifications is essentially a list: cleanliness, abstinence,penitence, adorations, sacrifices, prayers, consecrations. Buried within theexhaustive citations, however, are several important distinctions whichclarify the nature of ritual magic in DOP.A critical distinction is drawn between “sacred” and “consecrated”: sacredmeans “made holy by the gods themselves, or their demons, being . . .dedicated to us by the gods themselves,”118 while consecrated means“dedicated and consecrated by man to God”119 This is not itself an unusualor problematic split, but what falls into the two is worth examining closely.The list of sacred things has three elements. First, demons are sacred,“because in them God dwells. . . . Whence it is read in Exodus: I will sendmy angel who shall go before thee; observe him, neither think that he is tobe despised, because my name is in him.”120 Second, “mysteries” are sacred,in which category are “sacred names and characters,” the cross, and certainprayers such as the Lord’s Prayer. Third, certain materials are sacred, aschrism, catechumen oil, and holy water. The oddity of this list is that itequates demons with such things as the Lord’s Prayer and holy water. In thecontext of ritual magic, the implication is that all sacred things are to be used ;that is, a magical ritual may employ a demon in the same way and for thesame reasons as it employs holy water.The list of consecrated things is a good deal longer. First, vows andsacrifices; second, images, idols, icons, pictures, etc.; third, ritual actions,such as genuflexion, sprinkling holy water, burning candles, and so forth,collectively referred to as “exterior rites;”121 fourth, priests, who also have thepower to consecrate additional objects; fifth, consecrated names, seals, and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR198122DOP III:63, 591/669-70.123DOP III:63, 591/670.characters; and sixth, consecrated objects, which seems to be a catch-all. Tothese lists are added times, which may also be either sacred or consecrated,as the Sabbath on the one hand or a feast day on the other.There are two points which should be made with regard to the lists ofconsecrated and opposed to sacred things. First, we saw above that holywater and oil are sacred, because divinely instituted; at the same time, theacts of sprinkling holy water, or anointing with oil, are consecrated. Giventhat sacred things may be used, the suggestion here is that the act of using asacred thing is a consecrated act, which is to say “dedicated . . . by man toGod.” In the context of ritual magic, this confirms our sense that manipula-tion of any divine thing is licit, even required, so long as the manipulatingmagus consecrates the action by his will toward divinity.Second, “names, seals, and characters” appear in both lists. Thedistinction here is certainly that between divinely instituted names andthose derived from Scripture or from offices. In the midst of the discussionof consecrated names, however, appears a striking passage which shedsconsiderable light on DOP ’s relationship with Kabbalah:[There are also] names, figures, characters, and seals, which contemplativemen, in purity of mind, for their secret vows, have devoted, dedicated andconsecrated to the worship of God. . . . Thus not only by barbarous words,but also by <Hebrew,> Egyptian, Greek, Latin, and the names of otherlanguages, being devoted to God, and attributed and dedicated to his essence,power or operation, we sometimes do wonders. . . .122It is clear from the context that this passage refers to names like “God theFather,” “God the Creator,” or other names which have to do with offices,natures, and aspects: “so the Greeks call Jupiter, -−<\" •BÎ JÎ .−< whichsignifieth to live, because he giveth life to all things. . . .”123 If we recall thatthe Greek gods and their offices were paralleled to the sefirot, it is fairlycertain that the names of the emanations too would be consecrated ratherthan sacred names. Sacred names, then, are limited to a small number ofpersonal names, i.e. the Tetragrammaton, or Christ, which are mysteries.And yet, I emphasize that the word “Hebrew” does not appear in theJuvenile Draft, but was inserted only in the final edition of DOP. WherePico had argued, as noted earlier, that “No names that mean something,insofar as those names are singular and taken per se, can have power in a"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  199124Pico, 900 Theses 9>22, 501.125DOP III:24, 468/532; chapter not in W.126DOP III:58, 574/652, passage not in W.127DOP III:58, 575/652: “Melior autem et optima oratio, quae non ore profertur, sedquae silentio sancto et cogitatione integra Deo offertur quaeque voce mentis inclamansverbis intellectualis mundi veneratur praesules deos;” passage not in W. See also thepassage from I:69 quoted on page 61 above.magical work, unless they are Hebrew names, or closely derived fromHebrew,”124 the final draft of DOP suggests that the language of the namehas little to do with its power. This reading is corroborated by alreadyquoted remark in chapter 24, on demonic names:Many and divers are the names of good spirits, and bad: but their proper,and true names, as those of the stars, are known to God alone, who onlynumbers the multitude of stars, and calls them all by their names, whereofnone can be known by us but by divine revelation. . . . But the masters of theHebrew think that the names of the angels were imposed upon them byAdam. . . .125The implication of the insertion of “Hebrew” is, I think, that when writingthe Juvenile Draft Agrippa followed Reuchlin’s and Pico’s Kabbalisticunderstanding of Hebrew’s inherent superiority over all other lan-guages—hardly surprising, given that only a year before he had beenlecturing on De verbo mirifico in Dôle. Over the next twenty-odd years,however, the status of Hebrew—and of language itself—shifts in Agrippa’sphilosophy: no human language can contain the ultimate truths, because nohuman language can be truly transparent.This brings us to some final points about purification and ritual method.In chapter 58, on adorations and vows, we learn that the purpose of suchprayers is that “by the application of them to any deity we do so far move it,that he may direct his speech and answer by a divine way, by which . . . Godspeaks with men, but so occultly that very few perceive it.”126 Later in thesame chapter, we read:Now that is the best prayer, which is not uttered in words, but that whichwith a religious silence and sincere cogitation is offered up to God, and thatwhich with the voice of the mind and words of the intellectual world, isoffered to him.127If we situate this discussion of silent prayer within the broader examinationof ritual techniques, and recall that ritual techniques follow a lengthyconsideration of oracles and prophecy, it is clear that DOP has added a third"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR200kind of language—the “occult” voice and words of the intellectual anddivine world. This language transcends speech and writing, and the fallennature of language in general, and simply communicates transparently.Again, the notion of a divine language is hardly radical or problematic.At the same time, DOP claims that while the true magus can employ this“language,” the angels cannot. When dealing with inferior deities and spirits,the “various cooperators and instruments of God, viz.: the heavens, stars,administrating spirits, the celestial souls, and heros, which we must imploreas porters, intepreters, administrators, mediators,” the magician must useother forms of communication, while the “voice of the mind” is directed toGod alone.This divine super-language requires purity and perfection in the mind;in fact it is the ability to use this language which constitutes the properobject of ritual purification. In this language, the magician simply expresseshis will, and God expresses His: once the magus has reached this highestplane, he communicates directly with God. He speaks prophecy byparticipating in divine omniscience. Similarly, he performs miracles byparticipating in divine omnipotence. Indeed, prophecy and miracle are notsharply distinguished in Book III, suggesting that the magus, by acting as aperfect translator of the divine will—which is equivalent to the divinelanguage—is transformed into a perfect instrument of that will.In sum, the highest ritual magic is that by which the magician directlyenacts the divine will in the natural and celestial worlds.How to Summon a DemonThe reader may now expect (or hope for) a reconstruction of a demonicsummoning ritual, incorporating all these elements in some fashion,perhaps with commentary. Unfortunately, I cannot fulfil that hope withoutwild speculations extending the present analysis far beyond DOP and intothe literature of ritual magic more generally; in short, Agrippa simply doesnot provide sufficient information to perform the reconstruction.The descriptions of rituals which do appear in DOP are essentiallyparenthetical remarks, often amusing but not terribly helpful. Thefollowing two examples are fairly typical:I have seen and known some, writing on virgin parchment the name andseal of some spirit in the hour of the Moon: which when afterward he gave tobe devoured by a water frog, and had muttered over some verse, the frog being"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  201128DOP III:24, 469/532; passage not in W.129DOP III:11, 432-33/476; passage not in W.

I also saw thesame man inscribing the name of another spirit with the seal thereof in thehour of Mars, which was given to a crow, who being let go, after a versemuttered over, presently there followed from that corner of the heaven,whither he flew, lightnings, shakings, and horrible thunders, with thickclouds.128This appears in the first of the eight chapters detailing demonic names andhow to derive them. In the context of the power of divine names, chapter11 mentions. . . a sacred sigil [signaculum] . . . against any diseases of man, or any griefswhatsoever, in whose foreside are the four squared names of God. . . . But allmust be done in most pure gold, or virgin parchment, pure, clean andunspotted, also with ink made for this purpose, of the smoke of consecratedwax lights, or incense, and holy water; the actor must be purified and cleansedby sacrifice, and have an infallible hope, a constant faith, and his mind liftedup to the most high God, if he would surely obtain this divine power.129Insofar as one can adduce a set of instructions from such descriptions, ademonic summoning would seem to contain the following components,divided chronologically:Prior to the Ritual(1) Selection of an appropriate type of demon. This depends on the purposefor which the summoning is to be performed. If we wish to produce theApollonian frenzy, for instance, we might choose to summon a Solardemon.(2) Selection of an appropriate time. For a Solar demon, we mightchoose a time when the Sun is ascendant, perhaps with Leo at midheaven.130(3) Derivation of the relevant name. This requires choosing a methodby which to derive the name, which method should be appropriate to theoffice of the demon, and further the technical (often essentially crypto-graphic) derivation of the name.(4) Derivation of the proper seal. Again, simply the application of atechnical procedure to the derived name. We may note under this heading"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR202131DOP III:60, 582-83/662 includes a few brief imprecations used by the ancients insacrifices; these take the form “As X is consumed/killed/poured-out, so let X-related-evilbe consumed/killed/poured-out.” The context suggests that these are not required, but areprimarily indicative of the function of the sacrifice.132One might perhaps attempt a total reconstruction on the basis of such ritual magicthat, especially when dealing with unpredictable and/or evil demons, it maybe necessary to select and derive appropriate circles and texts to trap thedemons and to protect the magus.(5) Purification of the actor(s). Note that the supreme purification, inwhich the magus communicates directly with the divine, is presumably notnecessary, as it is ultimately the purpose of the ritual.At the Time of the RitualThese steps simply put into practice the steps above. That is, the locationshould be purified in a manner consistent with (a) the purification of thepractitioner(s), and (b) the selected demon. Most information about suchtechniques is in Books I and II—Book I includes lists of fumigationsappropriate to different planets, Book II has information about castingcircles and inscribing seals, etc.(1) Purification of the place.(2) Construction of the ritual space.(3) Casting of the circle.(4) Inscription of the seal.(5) Recitation of appropriate hymns and/or verses.(6) Sacrifice of a form appropriate to the demon. Note that “men thatare perfect, and truly religious need them not” apart from “the truesacrifice,” i.e. the mass.(7) Consecration of objects.(8) Words of command. Note that essentially no details are given aboutwhat words should be spoken, in what order, etc. No set-speeches appearin DOP, unlike most texts on ritual magic (see below).131Beyond this we can go no further. As noted above, Agrippa does not givemore explicit instructions, nor does he construct a ritual in recipe format.This is not simply an issue of available genres—the literature of ritual magicin the early modern period includes a great many such recipes, and as suchit would not be entirely out of place for a sample ritual to be detailed inDOP.132"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  203texts. To some degree, this is exactly what appears in the Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy,and one presumes that the pseudo-Agrippan author of this text intended thereby to fill theapparent gap in Agrippa’s Three Books. See Henrici Cornelii Agrippae liber quartus deocculta philosophia, seu de cerimoniis magicis. Cui accesserunt, Elementa magica Petri deAbano, philosophi, Marburg, 1559; in Opera this is De Caeremoniis Magicis liber, sed, utputatur, spurius: qui Quartus Agrippae de Occulta Philosophia habetur, 1:527-61.There are several reasons why I think a written-out ritual does not in factappear in the text. First, DOP is a theoretical work, not a practical manual,and as such details only the theory of magic. Second, each ritual would needto be significantly different from others, depending on the demon, thepurpose, the actors, and the location, to name only a few obvious factors.Third, inclusion of a complete magical ritual would place DOP squarely inthe proscribed category of ritual magic texts, laying Agrippa open to farmore serious and substantial charges than the rather nebulous claims ofunorthodoxy actually leveled against him. Fourth, the details of magicalpractice presumably fall under the heading of “secrets,” and as such cannotbe revealed openly to all readers. And finally, extending from the previouspoint, the “wise reader” is supposed to be able to construct his own ritual onthe basis of the theoretical details laid down in DOP ; to give a complete setof ritual instructions voids this function.Agrippa’s Magical RitualsDespite its skeletal quality, the ritual outline given above affords usconsiderable material for further analysis. If we recall our earlier discussionsof esotericism and modern ritual theory, we may draw several conclusionsabout the theory of magical ritual in DOP.Let me begin by presuming coherence—that is, I begin with theassumption that DOP ’s discussions of ritual components, with respect bothto content and to relative prioritization, are not accidental or irrelevant.Thus, for example, I assume that the eight chapters devoted to derivation ofangelic names implies not only that there are many ways to derive suchnames but also that these names are important.With this assumption in mind, one of the most striking aspects of ourritual outline is the apparent unimportance of the final “words of com-mand.” Even the briefest glance at early modern ritual magic texts willconfirm the strangeness of this lack: most such texts include lengthy (andrather tedious) set-speeches, often in two or more languages and includinglong lists of arcane-sounding names, which detail the purpose of the ritual,"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR204133Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to examine Arthur Edward Waite’s Book ofBlack Magic and Pacts (London: Rider & Sons, 1898; reprinted numerous times in YorkBeach, ME: Samuel Weiser, sometimes with slightly varying titles). Waite himself was animportant member of the Golden Dawn and Societas Rosicruciana In Anglia (S.R.I.A.)organizations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and his scholarship is notalways reliable. His work on black magic, however, is excellent, as Waite believed that suchmagic was essentially superstitious nonsense, and thus his book is mainly a series of longexcerpts and summaries of major grimoires with periodic scoffing editorial interjections.E.M. Butler’s Ritual Magic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1949; reprint,University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999) is also extremely useful,but has fewer and briefer excerpts.134DOP III:19, 457-59/518-19 treats “Of the bodies of the devils.”set constraints on the demon’s form and manner of appearance, promiserewards for good behavior and threaten dire punishment for disobedience,and instruct the demon in its required tasks.133 If we assume that this lackof instructions and constraints is not simply a product of the needs ofsecrecy or the exigencies of potential inquisitorial scrutiny, we may wonderhow it is that the demon knows what it is to do. In other words, if the ritualto summon a demon does not seem to include (or at least places no emphasisupon) explicit instructions for what tasks the demon is to perform, how doesit find out? If the ritual produces prophetic ecstasy, how does the prophesy-ing power know what is being asked?The simple, short reading is that, once the demon has appeared, themagus can simply talk to it. After all, most early modern ritual magic textsdiscuss the forms that the demon may take, the voices it uses, the signs(sounds, smells, visions) which portend its approach, and so forth. Some ofthese issues are also discussed in DOP,134 but again the descriptions are quiteperfunctory; furthermore such a reading emphasizes face-to-face communi-cation in a way quite at odds with the rest of DOP ’s semiotics.Instead, I suggest that the relative unimportance of explicit instructionsto the demons can be correlated with DOP ’s failure to provide explicitinstructions to the ritualist. I have referred to the latter sort of instructionsas recipes; an equally valid metaphor might be musical scores. My pointwith either metaphor is that the instructions, followed correctly, producethe desired performance—food, music, ritual. But if we return to the ideaproposed earlier in this chapter of ritual as written form, can it perhaps besaid that the ritual is itself the recipe or score? In other words, is the ritual atext whose correct interpretation or performance produces the desired end?Let me clarify by continuing the musical metaphor. If a magical ritual,by which I mean not a set of instructions but the performance of the ritual,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  205is like a musical score, then the ritual is presumably then translated intomagical or musical language. Here the magician’s act does not parallel thatof the musician, but rather that of the composer. The magician composesthe score (performs the ritual); the demon plays the music (produces thedesired magical effect). If the score is sufficiently detailed and clear, themusician plays the music that the composer wants—the ritual itselfconstrains the demon to perform the effects desired by the magician. Thusexplicit spoken commands are unnecessary, or at least relatively unimpor-tant, because the ritual itself is a set of detailed commands.Another metaphor, more clearly available within DOP and its culturalcontext, is ritual as hieroglyph. For those who can read the secret, magicallanguage of demonic ritual—magicians and demons—the hieroglyphicritual has a single, complex meaning. Further, the transparent andmotivated nature of the magical hieroglyph is such that the reader is boundby the force of the reference; in other words a demon who reads the ritualcannot help but express its meaning by performing the desired actions.Several aspects of DOP ’s discussion of demonic rituals confirm thisreading. First, the emphasis placed on demonic names; in the hieroglyphicritual, the demon is thus written into the text, ensuring that it is bound tothe magicians’s desired ends. This binding has a double function: thedemon is part of the text, and as such compelled by its meaning; in addition,the demon is addressed by the text, and thus compelled to read it.Second, the tremendous focus on the magician’s ritual purity can also bereread. We may draw a parallel to various literatures on copying sacredtexts, in which transcription is understood as a powerful and importantritual act. Further, the magician’s participation in the ritual binds him toits meaning in the same way as the demon is bound by its name; sufficientpurification ensures that nothing is written into the ritual that should notbe, such as base desires or a sinful nature, which could cause a moral shift inthe ritual’s meaning. Moreover given that (as we saw in Book I) humanminds can be bound through their sensual natures, a state of purity helpsprevent the magician from being caught in his own magical snare. Thispoint is neatly made in chapter 39:Seeing every power and virtue is from above, from God, from theintelligences and stars, who can neither err nor do evil, it is necessary, that allevil, and whatsoever is found disagreeing and dissonant in these inferiorthings, do proceed, not from the malice of the influence, but from the evildisposition of the receiver. . . . Therefore we being well disposed, the celestialinfluences cooperate all things for good; but being evil disposed, and having"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR206135DOP III:39, 517/589; chapter not in W.136In the next chapter I briefly expand upon the implications of such a reading.for our sins, that divine good, which was in us, departed from us, all thingswork for evil. . . .135Third, the conception of ritual as hieroglyph clarifies our sense of DOP ’sceremonial magic with respect to Faivre’s “experience of transmutation.”Because the magus is part of the text being read by the demons, the magicaleffects performed must inevitably affect the magus. There is thus “noseparation between knowledge (gnosis) and inner experience, or intellectualactivity and active imagination,” as Faivre put it. Indeed, if the “intellectualactivity” here is the construction of the ritual/text, and the “active imagina-tion” is the enactment of its effects/meaning, then the magician is simulta-neously performer and audience, actor and acted-upon, and as such may besaid to be utterly transformed by and for gnosis. In addition, Faivre’sformulation implies that most ceremonial magic will have a gnosticfunction, such as to learn or prophesy, which is entirely in accord with thetext of Book III.Finally, we may again note the lack of explicit instructions to the magus,and recognize that in our current reading such written instructions wouldact as pharmakoi. Although instructions remedy the possibility of memory-failure or incorrect ritual construction, they also poison the ritual bydisplacing the hieroglyph from its proper medium to one ill-suited to thetext. At base this is an occult reading of both Phaedrus and “Plato’sPharmacy”: writing in one medium (ink on paper) is a pharmakon forwriting in another (ritual, memory, even speech!).136ConclusionsBefore turning to general conclusions, there are two issues which should beconsidered here. First, DOP and Christian Kabbalah; and second, writingand ritual magic in DOP.Agrippa’s Christian KabbalahOur initial discussion of Kabbalah scholarship left us with two primaryquestions about Kabbalah in DOP: First, in what sense if any can Agrippa’s"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS  207Kabbalah be legitimately called Kabbalah? Second, if Agrippa’s Kabbalahis Christian Kabbalah, what does that tell us about Christian Kabbalah as aform of thought?Agrippa’s Kabbalah is certainly Kabbalah in any but the most parochialsense, i.e. if it is granted that Kabbalah need not be Jewish. We have seenthat Idel’s magico-mystical model fits quite well with DOP, in which boththe rising, ecstatic model of magical ritual and the descending, looselytheosophical model are central. Indeed, the intersection between these twomodels constitutes a major part of the magician’s itinerarium mentis inDeum. Further, a number of systems and theories of distinctively Kabbalist-ic provenance appear clearly in DOP, notably the sefirot, speculations upondivine and angelic names, and so forth. It seems certain that Agrippa’s sources for these ideas were largelyChristian—Pico, Reuchlin, Lazzarelli, Zorzi, Egidius da Viterbo—but healso made use of Jewish sources where they were available to him inLatin—Gikatilla’s Sha’are Orah in Paulus Riccius’s translation Portae Lucis,for example. Close examination of Agrippa’s sources has been left out of thebody of the present analysis, since Vittoria Perrone Compagni’s criticaledition of DOP makes clear which sources were used; it is certainly possiblethat comparison with the texts available to Pico and Reuchlin would revealadditional sources, but such analysis is outside the scope of the presentstudy. What is relevant here is that Agrippa’s Kabbalah derives fromreasonably well-informed sources, which made available to him aspects oftheosophical, ecstatic, and magical Kabbalah.The problem with Agrippa as Kabbalist is that he radically reinterprets;the Kabbalah found in DOP has strong affinities with aspects of its Jewishsources, but is ultimately quite at odds with Kabbalah at a basic level. Thequestion, then, is whether Agrippa grossly misunderstands Kabbalah, orwhether the reinterpretation is in some sense reasonable.In the present analysis, I have tried to demonstrate the coherence andinternal consistency of DOP ’s Kabbalah. Certain points stand out,particularly the displacement of Hebrew from a supreme linguistic position,which as we have seen appears to be a relatively late development inAgrippa’s thought. I suggest, in particular, that the status-shift of Hebrewis emblematic of his skeptical, Christian rethinking of Kabbalistic ideas.In Agrippa’s Kabbalistic sources, and I think Kabbalah generally, theprimacy of Hebrew as sacred language is a central article of faith; withoutthis assumption, a good deal of Kabbalistic speculation has no evidentiaryfoundation. However, Agrippa’s deeply Christian skepticism, as well as his"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR208137De vanitate 47, 101/137.linguistic sophistication, makes highly problematic the proposition that anyhuman language is somehow transparent. Furthermore, Agrippa’sskepticism is founded on the notion that one single assumption—theIncarnation of Christ—is required to revitalize and correct all humanknowledge; as such, an additional metaphysical absolute such as theperfection of the Hebrew language constitutes a major difficulty.For the sake of clarity and brevity, I shall summarize Agrippa’s skepticalChristian reinterpretation of Kabbalah in a series of steps, as follows: Christ’s Incarnation breaks the dominance of the Hebrew Law, andindeed “the Jews who are most skillful in using the names of God, canoperate little or nothing after Christ. . . .”137Now the Incarnation is the appearance in Nature of the spoken Word ofGod. At this point, the tripartite nature of creation is fully empow-ered—Christ rules Nature, the world of Speech, as the natural incarnationof Logos; the Holy Spirit rules the Celestial, in the form of the written Wordof Scripture; and God the Father rules the divine, the world of transparentand perfect super-language. Therefore the Incarnation completes theformation of the ladder up to God—by following Christ, the magus can risethrough the spheres.Therefore the power and sophistication of Hebrew Kabbalah is not to bedespised, but can only take the Christian magus to the peak of those spheresin which the Holy Spirit dominates. Ultimately, the magus must break outof the vicious circle of language, Hebrew and otherwise, and transcend toperfect transparency by supra-linguistic communication with God.Thus the restoration of all knowledge and truth, which is to say thecorrelation of all that we think we know against the absolute Truth of God,requires only a single axiomatic assumption—the Incarnation. Further-more, the ascent to Truth has only one absolute instruction—follow Christ.Along the way, all the priscae theologiae et magiae will be helpful, butultimately the magus must discard them in the same way as the apophaticmystic discards all names as insufficient.A final corollary of this interpretation is that Jews are excluded from thisperfect union with God, because they cannot break out of the sphere of Lawwithout the assistance of Christ.I n s u m , A g r i p p a ’ s K a b b a l a h i s a p u r e l y C h r i s t i a n o n e , t r e a t i n g t h i s s a c r e dJewish lore as an extremely important and valuable tool, but not granting it"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS209138Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, Kabbala denudata, seu Doctrina Hebraeorumtranscendentalis et metaphysica atque theologica. . . , 3 v.-in-2 (Sulzbach & Frankfurt, 1677).139See Allison P.

In a way, we can perhaps say that Agrippa’sChristian Kabbalah represents a stage in the maturation of ChristianKabbalah, a step beyond the initial wide-eyed awe of Pico and Reuchlin, andof the young Agrippa himself, for whom the discovery of Kabbalah seemedto offer potential solutions to basic mystical and magical problems.It remains for future scholarship to ask why Christian Kabbalah died asquickly as it did. After about the mid-seventeenth century, which sawChristian Knorr von Rosenroth’s massive Kabbala denudata [KabbalahUnveiled],138 Christian Kabbalah more or less vanished as a form of occultthought. Jewish Kabbalistic thought, particularly Lurianic Kabbalah,reappears periodically over the next two centuries, in Behmenist thought,in Leibniz’s theories of perfect languages,139 in speculative Freemasonry,even in Schelling’s Die Weltalter,140 and comes back to the center ofoccultism with Eliphas Lévi in the mid-nineteenth century. But ChristianKabbalah, of the sort formulated by Agrippa, Postel, and others in thesixteenth century, has its last gasp with Knorr von Rosenroth and RobertFludd in the seventeenth century.The reasons for this collapse still require analysis. Our present discussionof Christian Kabbalah in DOP suggests that it may be necessary to lookmore closely into early modern linguistic philosophies. I suspect, in fact,that some strains of Christian Kabbalah essentially lived and died along withmetaphysical linguistic philosophy, and that therefore a considerable wealthof Christian Kabbalah may have heretofore been ignored because it is notsufficiently obviously Kabbalistic to be included in the standard historicalaccount.Rewriting Ritual MagicIn DOP, the consummation of all ritual magic is to effect transparentcommunication between God and the magus. Ideally, the magus becomesa nexus between God and the World. Linguistically, we might say that Godwrites His message upon the magus, and the magus translates that messageinto the speech of the World. But in DOP, as we have seen, there are really"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR210141DOP III:23, 468/530; chapter not in W.three kinds of language, each proper to one sphere. As a general rule,magical power over nature employs celestial forces to control the natural;that is, the magus writes his effects into the celestial, which in turn speaksthem into nature. Thus the conception of God writing and the magusspeaking is incorrect, shifted one place in the system of three worlds andthree languages: it would be more accurate to say that (1) God communicateswith the magus in the divine language of silence and transparency, (2) themagus writes that message celestially, and (3) the demonic hierarchy speaksthe message into being in nature.This is the supreme case, where the magus here has succeeded in thehighest manner possible, an idealized picture of the perfect magus. Mostmagical rituals, however, are intended primarily to achieve this effect, anddo not depend on its prior completion. For the normal magician, the forcesmanipulated are mediate, demons rather than God. Further, the demonscannot communicate in the divine manner, but require exterior signs, fixedin space. In addition, they cannot speak in a way understandable to us: “Butwith what senses those spirits and demons hear our invocations, and prayers,and see our ceremonies, we are altogether ignorant.”141 Therefore undernormal circumstances, a ritual is a written message sent to the demon toenable communication. Ritual techniques and symbols are thus a languagewhich clothes the magician’s intentions, desires, and purity of purpose insigns comprehensible by demons.My claim that ritual language in DOP is written does not dependexclusively on the linguistic abilities of demons; more interestingly, thismagical ritual language has certain characteristics associated with writing,although one should not overstretch the analogy.First, the ritual signs are fixed in space, made up of concrete, physicalsigns. At the same time, it may be pointed out that the ritual is also fixed intime, a characteristic normally associated with speech as against writing.Against this argument, I want to point to two factors which further thewritten interpretation. One is the fact that the time of the ritual is itself asign, as indicated by the extended discussions of favorable times in DOP; wecan thus understand the time of the ritual as part of its place, a placegoverned by favorable stars. In addition, the temporal aspect of the ritualcan be understood to parallel the physical act of writing, which has little orno bearing on the interpretation of the text—that is, we cannot generally"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS211142In some texts, the medium is often a prepubescent boy—virgin parchment indeed!interpret a written text by presuming that it was written in exactly the orderof its final formation, but rather ignore any editing or revisions and simplytake the final text as a fixed object.The second written-like characteristic of ritual language is the disjunc-ture of the final text from its author, which entails that interpretive controlis in the hands of the recipient, rather than the producer. Once the signs areformed, the interpretation of the message is entirely up to the demons—themagus cannot correct misinterpretations. This is one of the dangers ofdemonic magic: if you get the signs wrong, the demons will not actaccording to your intention, but only according to the instructions actuallygiven, rather like a computer program. Indeed, if the ritual is badly written,either (1) the demons will not understand that they are bound to interpretand obey it, in which case the ritual has no effect; or worse (2) the wrongsort of demons will take the opportunity to pretend that the ritual wascorrectly written, at which point the magus is likely deceived by them, andbegins down the slippery slope to perdition.Third, the signs are graphically (spatially) divisible: each sign has its ownmeaning, and can be interpreted separately. While the totality of the texthas meaning, each element can be analyzed separately; indeed, individualanalyses make up many chapters of DOP. Further, note that the order of theritual receives no particular treatment in DOP, implying that suchsubdivision is normal to the linguistic function of magic.Once the ritual is written by the magus and read by the demons, we maynote that the demons essentially respond in writing. First, they may writeeffects into the world—being celestial or divine, they do not speak theireffects, as noted above. Second, they may produce prophecy or oracles: thisshould be understood as writing, since interpretive control does not remainwith the message’s demonic producer, but is rather interpreted at themagician’s leisure. There is even some indication that it is common to usea proxy for basic prophecy, an assistant who is essentially the slate uponwhich the demons write their prophetic messages.142 Third, in frenzy andecstasy, the demons write upon the magus’s soul; it is not so much that theycommunicate anything to him in a normal sense, but that they write effects,just as in other circumstances they write effects into the world.As mentioned at the outset, I believe this approach to ritual as writing hasbroader application than DOP, or even Renaissance ritual magic.

InTambiah’s speech-act approach, divination is marginal, a special case; mysense is that a theory of magic which cannot treat divination is fundamen-tally unsound, rather like a theory of religion which ignores ritual. As wehave seen with DOP, both in the ritual magic per se and in the mathematicalmagic, divination is readily understood as writing, and indeed is ratherdifficult to interpret otherwise. Thus the ritual-as-writing approach goessome way toward clarifying the centrality of divination in magic.Second, this approach assists in rethinking the importance of space inritual. Ritual, like writing, is fundamentally spatial, not temporal, and thusthinking of ritual as writing makes the centrality of space logically necessaryrather than a peculiarity. In other words, a written approach to ritual makesthe spatial focus normal, even predictable; it is something which explains thenature of ritual, not something requiring explanation.Finally, the instruction “write” is extremely common in magical rituals,as Jonathan Z.

First, one might construct a kind of parallel exegesis, with runningcommentary alongside a new, corrected translation. The advantage of thismethod is that every section of the work is considered, nothing left out,and the biases and prior conclusions of the scholar are, if not eliminated,at least partially suppressed; the great disadvantage, of course, is that theresulting analysis is unreadable. Second, one can begin with a few axes togrind, a few issues at stake, and selectively analyze those pieces of the workwhich seem relevant; so long as the scholar’s predetermined queries arepassably compatible with those of the work in question, this produces ananalysis which sacrifices coverage (and tedium) for depth.As should be obvious, I have attempted the second method.

In the second section, Iexamine this reading’s broader implications for early modern historians ofideas. The final section considers potential theoretical and methodologicalramifications, returning to the broad questions which framed our readingin chapter one.Agrippan InterpretationsScholarly assessment of DOP has been predominantly negative. WhenAgrippa’s writings are granted intellectual value, it is usually in referenceto De vanitate, though recent scholarship has also argued for the value ofthe numerous minor orations and theological texts.1The standard criticism of DOP is that it is incoherent in one or moreof several possible ways. Lynn Thorndike, whose focus was always uponthe relation between magical thought and the rise of experimental science,put this most succinctly:. . . [DOP ] is a disappointing book. It is not a practical manual or even ageneral theory of the subject but merely a literary description and review,full of what the author doubtless flattered himself was erudite allusion andhumanistic eloquence. . . . [Agrippa] has read widely in its [magic’s] pastliterature and [DOP ] is valuable in a scattering way for its bibliography. Yeteven in this respect he has failed to achieve anything like an exhaustive orsystematic review.2This reading of DOP as a sort of compendium of quotations is notsurprising, as the work bristles with references, usually unattributed,3 butthe major criticism is that DOP is unoriginal, a compilation of otherwriters’ ideas with no argument or focus.At the same time scholars have implied that the radically demonicorientation of DOP pushes it out of the range of acceptable discourse, and"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION2154Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago & London: University of ChicagoPress & Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1966), 11; I thank Jonathan Z.

Finally, theapparent disagreement or disjuncture between the 1526 De vanitate andthe 1531/33 DOP has been used as proof-positive that Agrippa was not acoherent or systematic thinker, and as such anything he argued or claimedneed not be taken seriously.In this book, I have tried to counter all of these claims at once, byarguing the coherence, consistency, and sophistication of Agrippa’smagical thought. Perhaps the most important point is consistency:throughout, DOP harps on its several issues, and discusses them in arigidly logical fashion. Indeed, consistency itself appears to be afundamental methodology in DOP, as we have seen in the peculiar andsometimes pedantic tendency to follow any principle logically to itsultimate conclusions, no matter how unorthodox or dangerous.This tendency toward extreme consistency is perhaps most noticeablein DOP ’s emphasis on demonic magic. In Book I, the defense of demonicmagic in DOP is based on strict and logical consideration of intelligenceand its manipulation, and avoids the internal inconsistencies whichmarked Ficino’s and Trithemius’s definitions. In Book II, this sameargument extends into the celestial and mathematical sphere, and theintersection of intelligences with Forms in a supra-natural and extra-temporal context leads at least partly to that book’s fixation on writing,particularly as an instrument in demonic magic. In Book III, thediscussion of demonic magic is taken to its logical extreme: the superiorityof demonic magic over natural magic is so great that demonic magicbecomes a means to achieve union with God.In The Savage Mind, Claude Lévi-Strauss remarked that “the firstdifference between magic and science is . . . that magic postulates acomplete and all-embracing determinism.”4 Lévi-Strauss, inspired by hisreading of E.E. Evans-Pritchard, suggests that science is fundamentallymodest in its claims, that scientific analysis ceases at a certain culturally-determined point—to use Evans-Pritchard’s example, the scientist knowsthat a granary fell down because of wind, termites, and dry rot, and soconcludes his analysis. The magician, however, continues the logicrelentlessly: he demands to know why the granary fell down on someone.Not just someone, in fact—why did the granary fall on that someone? In"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE216theory, such a logic cannot end short of omniscience, of a divineunderstanding of all things simultaneously and how they all intersect andinteract.Whether or not Lévi-Strauss’s idea, or Evans-Pritchard’s, is an accuratepicture of magic’s underlying logic—and it is worth renewedconsideration—this demand for extreme logical consistency is a centralelement of DOP ’s magic. Although at times the logic is specious, DOPsimply cannot be read as inconsistent or incoherent. In essence,DOP presumes consistency within the universe itself, that the apparentlyunrelated laws of Creation reduce to a few absolutely generalizableprinciples, and further that these general principles must apply in everycircumstance. And in the end, all such principles reduce to one—or ratherto One.The principal difficulty in reading DOP, then, is that this absoluteconsistency requires evidence, leading to encyclopedic—and oftentedious—lists of facts. Further, DOP uses this very tedium to maskunorthodoxy. We have seen on several occasions that a long and ratherdull series of chapters, apparently containing only paraphrased citations,conceals a subtle and often radical argument, the very pedantry of theformat making the argument seem obvious and unremarkable. I suggest,however, that this pattern is not simply a “defense mechanism” (to useFrances Yates’s unfortunate phrase) against potential persecution of theauthor; on the contrary, I think that DOP makes many of its most excitingarguments hard to find in order to preserve these secrets from the eyes ofthe foolish. If only “the wise” will discover the secrets of magic in DOP,then wisdom is partly connected with a willingness to read closely.At the very beginning of this book, I noted that Agrippa referred to a“secret key” to DOP. Given the grand structure of the work, the secret keycould hardly be some trick, some sleight; it would have to be afundamental principle of occult knowledge and philosophy, a principleitself hidden and occult. The key must have the grandest possible cosmicsignificance, and at the same time be a methodological principle whichguides the entirety of the magician’s quest. Furthermore, this key wouldneed to be obvious, something which could not possibly be denied,something of which a “wise” reader would, upon realizing it, say “Ofcourse!” In sum, Agrippa’s “secret key” cannot be anything other thanfaith in Christ."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION2175De vanitate 48:104-5/141-2; the text appears on page 46 above.On Occult SkepticismThe other great difficulty in scholarship on Agrippa’s thought has been thefamous “retraction” of DOP which appears in De vanitate.5 In chaptertwo, I discussed a number of the theories which have been proposed todeal with this retraction, and suggested that the solution is twofold: first,the retraction is simply not as general and sweeping as it appears; second,the skeptical thrust of De vanitate in no way disagrees with the occultphilosophy. In the wake of our close reading of DOP, I would like toresume the main points of this latter argument.De vanitate argues a comprehensive Christian and Pyrrhonistskepticism. Human knowledge is fundamentally flawed, because eachsupposed fact depends on another, leading to infinite regress.Furthermore, all theoretical knowledge which depends upon the senses orreason is intrinsically incapable of breaking out of this epistemologicalprison, because sensory data are unreliable, and reason requires reliabledata if it is to draw reliable conclusions. In short, all intellectual efforts areimpotent before the fundamental absence of absolutes, indeed thefundamental absence at the core of the universe. Given this bleak pictureof intellectual endeavors’ impotence, argues Agrippa, we can only discardour vain and fruitless pseudo-learning and prescind from the search forTruth. In its place, we can only have faith in Christ, the Word of God,who promised that if we asked for bread, we should not be given a stone.Such is, in brief, the central argument of De vanitate. It is an argumentwithin the mainstream of the Renaissance skeptical revival, in whichmovement the book played a noteworthy part. From our present point ofview, it should be noted that Descartes’s cogito does not answer theobjections which De vanitate proposed; indeed, Descartes seems not tohave recognized that the problem of infinite regress applies to rationallyconstructed data. As such, the value of the cogito as an absolute datumcollapses in the face of Agrippa’s full-blown skeptical epistemology.But the parallel between Descartes and Agrippa is worth pursuing. Ofparticular value here is the dual nature of the Cartesian project, made upof analysis and synthesis. In the analytical portions of the Discourse on theMethod and the Meditations, Descartes moves inwards, applying hismethodic doubt in a logically descending chain of supposed knowledges,none of which stand up to destructive skepticism. At the end of the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE218analytical process, however, Descartes is left with one fact which cannot bedoubted—the “I” which does the thinking—cogito ergo sum. With thatone indubitable given, Descartes works synthetically to reconstruct allknowledge and philosophy. He establishes the existence of God, whichguarantees the reality and validity of sensory data, then moves outwardand upward with the synthetic reconstruction.Agrippa’s project is not at heart dissimilar. De vanitate should be readas the first two of Agrippa’s Meditations on First Philosophy, concludingwith one indubitable given: the Incarnate Word. DOP is the syntheticportion of the project, rebuilding and reconstructing knowledge andphilosophy upon the capstone of Christ. The apparent disagreementbetween De vanitate and DOP is thus primarily an effect of the differencebetween analysis and synthesis.One of the obvious questions to ask of Descartes’s synthetic project iswhether the philosopher is actually consistent to the method he hasdescribed. That is, is every synthetic point really impregnable to themethodic doubt that produced the cogito? The same question maylegitimately be asked of Agrippa: is it certain that every point made inDOP requires no axioms or assumptions apart from the Incarnation?Throughout the present book, I have traced the ways in which DOPconnects the occult and manifest principles and facts of the spheres withthe certainty of the Incarnation. I have also tried to show that, from alinguistic-philosophical stance, the Incarnate Word actually makes a ratherclever solution to problem of skeptical epistemology, in that it not onlyserves as an absolute datum for Nature and the Divine, but also establishesa metaphysical connection between the two by revealing a potentiality forlanguage to achieve Truth through the Word.Nevertheless, I can hardly claim that DOP ultimately achieves itssynthetic goals. Just as Descartes needed his rather shoddy proof for theexistence of God in order to progress beyond the cogito, and therebyinserted another unwarranted assumption, so Agrippa assumed that thereality of the Incarnation validated Scripture as a datum, and therebyprecipitated the occult philosophy back into the prison of language. In the Introduction I claimed that DOP seeks a way out of logocen-trism, out of the absence which haunts language and reality, and that thesolution is perhaps itself the ultimate logocentrism; I think that theanalysis bears this out. In the present context, we may add that it is Devanitate which exposes the absence, and proposes the Christian solutionwhich guides the entirety of DOP. Any future assessment of the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION2196Giordano Bruno, De umbris idearum . . . Ad internam scripturam, & non vulgares permemoriam operationes explicatis (Paris, 1582).philosophical worth of Agrippa’s philosophical project must recognizethat, like Descartes’s, it has two parts. While one might legitimately arguethat the analytical De vanitate is more successful in achieving its goals thanis the synthetic De occulta philosophia, this is not evidence against Agrippaas a philosopher—after all, the same can be said of Cartesian rationalism.Historical SpeculationsIf we have now established DOP as a coherent and sophisticatedphilosophical statement, it remains to be seen what (if any) effect this hason the historiography of early modern intellectual currents. I cannot hopeto project all the possible ramifications of a revised reading of DOP, nordo I wish to suggest that the present reading necessitates radicalreinterpretation of early modern intellectual history in general. Instead,I shall make a series of quick guesses about possible implications forparticular areas of the history of ideas.The impact of DOP upon the history of early modern magic is fairlyobvious, although as noted before scholars have been wary of granting itthe importance it deserves. One difficulty is simply that there are fewscholars whose intellectual focus is magic, and most of these few bring tothe field assumptions and priorities drawn from the history of science orphilosophy. Furthermore most of those in this nascent discipline of theHistory of Magic seem primarily interested in thinkers later than Agrippa;at least partly inspired by Frances Yates, they orient their studies of magicalthought around Giordano Bruno most especially, and to a lesser degreeDee, with Fludd, Ficino, Pico, and Cardano considerably behind.Further, historians of magic are generally not theoretically oriented; theyconsider themselves historians in a relatively classical sense, and are leeryof the admittedly deep pitfalls of “high theory.”I intend that the present analysis pose a challenge to historians ofmagic. We need to reread Bruno and Dee, bearing in mind that they readAgrippa and furthermore were deeply interested in and influenced by hiswork. One can already see, I think, how our understanding of Bruno’s arsmemorativa as internal writing (scriptura interna 6) might change in light ofa sophisticated magical-written semiotic. Similarly, Dee’s Monas hiero-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE2207Nicholas H. Clulee’s analysis in John Dee's Natural Philosophy: Between Science andReligion (London: Routledge, 1988) is excitingly frustrating in this respect: Clulee takes theanalysis to the very edges of a theoretical, semiotic understanding of the monas, then stops.A “theory-headed” re-examination will certainly be necessary.8Paracelsus [Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim], De occultaphilosophia, in Paracelsus sämtliche Werke nach der 10Bändichen Huserschen Gesamtausgabe,ed.

Gustav Fischer, 1932), 9(4).292-326.One might also consider Paracelsus’s discussion of sigils (Siegeln) and characters for use inamulets: Archidoxis Magica, in ibid., 10(4).897-962.oglyphica will require rethinking, as Dee claimed for this singlehieroglyphic sigil the possibility of a restitution or restoration of allknowledge and language.7This rereading of the history of magical philosophies will necessarilyhave some impact on the history of philosophy more generally. I havealready argued that Agrippa’s project has close parallels to Descartes’s, andthis connection may in time expand our understanding of the skepticalrevival. In addition, there is growing scholarly interest in early modernlinguistic and semiotic philosophies, and I suspect that our reading of thehistory of speculations about language can be deepened by recognition ofthe part which magical philosophy played in that history.A similar effect will apply, though less directly, in the history of earlymodern science. For example, there has so far as I can tell been littleattempt to consider the details of Agrippa’s influence on Paracelsus,although the latter certainly read Agrippa—indeed, he even entitled oneof his own works De occulta philosophia!8 Considering the importance inParacelsian thought of the “Book of Nature,” it seems entirely possible thatportions of the Paracelsian corpus may be clarified by comparison to anAgrippan understanding of the text/nature relation.Theoretical MeditationsAt the outset of this book I proposed that the various theoretical andmethodological positions be used not only as lenses for examining DOP,but also as conversation partners for DOP ’s projected magus. Over thecourse of the analysis, this conversation has come to include a wide rangeof thinkers, both Agrippa’s contemporaries and our own, from a broadspectrum of disciplines and schools. As yet, however, the magus whooccasions this imagined conversation has not responded, apart from very"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION221intermittent asides. In this final section, the time has at last come for theAgrippan magus to address the other thinkers at this odd symposium.Hermetic Hermeneutics and HistoryLinguistic philosophy has played a significant role in this study, largelybecause DOP is deeply invested in a linguistic-philosophical project. Insuggesting possible implications of this reading for (post)modern linguisticphilosophy, I must acknowledge my own lack of expertise—I am nottrained as a linguistic philosopher. At the same time, making sense ofDOP has required some rethinking of linguistic issues, which may be ofvalue for scholars so trained.The primary point I would like to draw attention to is the issue of whatI have termed analog signification (page 138 above). In Agrippa’s magicalsemiotics, the ultimate range of a sign’s possible motivation is unlimited;that is, a given sign can be locked to its referent to such a degree thatmanipulation of the sign has corresponding effects on the referent. Whilesuch a conclusion depends upon a metaphysics which can no longer beaccepted, the idea that signification need not be thought in binary termsis worth consideration.As a simple example, suppose we have a cat and several signs whichrefer to that cat. It is apparent that the spoken word /’kat/ and the written“cat” refer to the animal in different ways, and that “Fluffy” refers to herin yet another; all this is quite ordinary semiotics. Suppose we also haveseveral iconic signs: a stick-figure drawing of a cat, a simple sketch, and aphotograph of Fluffy herself. Can it be said that the photograph refersmore strongly than the stick-figure? That is, is it a more effective way ofreferring to Fluffy? If it is further recognized that modern semioticiansand linguistic philosophers are continually breaking down the arbitrarybarriers between icon, index, and symbol, is there any a priori reason toassume that only icons have this range of referential power? If more thanone mode of referring is employed—if the photograph has a label, forexample—what effect does this have on the sign’s power?In fact, the fundamental issue here is the sign’s “power.” Outside of amagical semiotic, in which this power is potentially quite tangible, whatwould it mean to say that one sign is more powerful, or effective, orefficient, than another?This is not, I think, a question that can be dismissed easily. As I haveargued (page 135), the logocentric criticism of writing as “distant” already"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE222implies that some signs are weaker than others. Most traditionally, theclaim is that speech has presence while writing has only absence. But ifmore recent linguistic philosophy has granted that all language is hauntedby absence, then a binary distinction between presence and absence cannotbe maintained. At the same time it is clear that signs do not refer to allreferents; thus it seems valid to say that, with respect to Fluffy at least,“cat” is a stronger sign than “dog.” We can go farther—both “cat” and“dog” are pets, and thus presumably both are stronger with respect toFluffy than is “teacup,” not to mention an abstraction such as “magic.”Thus there is some reason to think that signs can be more or less“powerful,” but this notion of “power” has yet to be clearly formulated aspart of the sign. I suggest that Agrippa’s analog signification—which istheorized in various ways by many early modern linguisticphilosophers—offers valuable resources for thinking the power of the sign.I would like to conclude by posing a peculiar question. In theIntroduction, I discussed Jacques Derrida’s famous essay “Plato’sPharmacy,” and remarked on Derrida’s failure to mention Theuth’sinvention of magic (page 25). I think this absence points to a moregeneral issue: the occult haunts the margins of Derrida’s work. Ghosts,haunting, specters—these metaphors are used constantly. In goodDerridean fashion, then, we should ask what is signified by this commonthread in deconstruction’s rhetoric.Three avenues for investigation suggest themselves to me; it seems notunlikely that all three are closely intertwined. First, if (as I shall suggest inthe next and final section) writing and magic are somehow conceptuallylinked, it is hardly surprising to find that magic makes its spectral presenceknown in philosophical discourse on writing. Second, a great part ofDerrida’s philosophical project has been to continue the overthrow ofmodernist metaphysics, whose outlines were most powerfully delineatedin the early seventeenth century; as such, it is not intrinsically odd that thesixteenth century philosophical movement which was almost entirelydestroyed by modern philosophy and science—I refer of course tomagic—still haunts the margins of philosophical memory. Third, it isworth considering the periodic resurfacing of magical thought inphilosophy after Descartes (Schelling’s fascination with Lurianic Kabbalahleaps to mind), which might provoke us to wonder whether magic hasalways played the role of modernism’s ghostly other.I cannot project the conclusion of this magical deconstruction ofdeconstruction; I do believe, however, that this is a point at which early"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION223modern intellectual historians can play a role in modern philosophy. Ingeneral, such historians have been reluctant to involve themselves in “hightheory,” and thus have not had much impact on recent philosophicalspeculation. This reluctance is unfortunate, having at times hamperedhistorical scholarship, as suggested above in my discussion of Agrippa inthe history of magic, science, and philosophy. Indeed, by avoiding“theory,” early modern intellectual historians have also perhaps deprivedphilosophers and theorists of insights which may prove of fundamentalimportance.Writing MagicIn the Introduction I suggested that a reading of early modern magicalthought might help clarify a hoary old problem in the history of religionsand anthropology, the definition of magic. In chapter four, I added asketch of a possible rethinking of ritual theory on written-semiotic lines(page 241). In this final section, I would like briefly to outline the waysin which the present analysis of DOP may assist in reopening the questionof magic. I have no intention of proposing a new theory or definition ofmagic as such; rather, I would like to sketch a way to move the questionforward which may prove more profitable.Let me begin by granting some force to the social construction theoryof religion and ritual, which is to say that “religion” and “ritual,” asordinarily employed, are categories which primarily revolve around socialspheres. Further, I accept provisionally that social interaction is ordinarilybased upon and parallel to speech. I suggest, then, that we can clarify theoppositive nature of definitions of magic by postulating a similarconnection between magic and writing.Definitions of magic are very commonly negative, based on opposition:magic is the bastard sister of science, magic is illicit religion. A similarnegative rhetoric is often applied to writing: writing is an imitation ofmemory, writing is a supplement to speech. But this notion famouslydeconstructs itself: writing is a supplement to speech, in that it isunnecessary and exterior to speech, but simultaneously necessary. For thisvery reason, it is also despised and suspected by the very people one wouldexpect to valorize it, such as philosophers and academics. Suppose, then,that magic is defined as a supplement to religion; unnecessary and exterior,despised, but always already a haunting and needed figure on the marginsof religion. And yet, that last sentence is just as accurate—and as"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE224inaccurate—if we replace “religion” with “science.” In a sense, magic isthe writing of mainstream intellectual culture.Let me clarify this gnomic remark. Suppose we imagine a broadintellectual sphere involving science and religion, not only the site of theircontestation and intersection but also the totality of cultural life asdominated by these two general categories; we might call this broad sphere“mainstream intellectual culture.” Now all the constituents of mainstreamintellectual culture thus defined are founded upon deep and essentiallyinevitable logocentric assumptions: it is hard to imagine the scientific orreligious pundits of the present-day or early modern worlds surrenderingall claims to knowledge and communication with the extra-human(Nature in itself, the divine) as flatly unworkable, useless, founded uponabsence rather than presence. So if mainstream intellectual culture ofmodern and early modern Euro-American culture is at heart rooted in afallacious metaphysics of presence, parallel to speech in a logocentricconception of language, what written specter haunts Europe?The answer, I suggest, is magic.The problem with this abstraction is that the categories are notcommensurable. “Religion” and “science” are modern second-orderconstructs, abstract scholarly categories with no “real” existence elsewhere.“Magic,” on the other hand, seems to be a cross-cultural category withfirst-order utility. Furthermore since our present focus is on magic as apracticed phenomenon, not an artifact of social cleavages, we find thatmagic (or its apparent categorical parallels) in each culture has its ownhistory, its own mythology, its own distinctive culture. Thus a purelyabstract categorical definition will not suffice to cover “magic” in its livedcultural reality.At the same time there is a relatively simple solution to this problem.Although “magic” begins as an oppositional label, an abstraction whichcarries the same valence as writing with respect to speech, that label onceapplied is often embraced by members of the culture in question. If magicbegins as something which “they” do, very soon there will be a “they” whodo in fact practice magic. And from that moment, magic has a history,and begins immediately to diverge from a simple abstraction.This is not, let me hasten to add, an historical account. We areunlikely ever to find this inaugural moment, when “magic” ceases to bemerely a label and becomes a lived practice, for the same reasons that weare unlikely to uncover evidence of the mythical “invention” of religion.But I suggest that the constant interaction of mainstream intellectual"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION225culture with those who embrace “magic” will generally ensure that theterm retains some germ of the abstraction.From a methodological and theoretical standpoint, this interactionmust also be recapitulated constantly in scholarly analysis. On the onehand, there is no value in a definition of magic which cannot embraceactual magical practices; for this reason the social cleavage model is of littleutility for magic in general, despite its value in the analysis of witchcraftin particular. At the same time, a purely historical and culturally specificdescription cannot serve a broad definitional function, as there is no reasonto suppose that such a description will be generalizable. Thus a scholarlyanalysis of magic must continually cycle between “magic” as label and“magic” as practiced cultural reality, and through the operation of thishermeneutic circle we may begin to generate a functional scholarly categoryof magic.My suspicion, as stated before, is that magical thought and practiceswill always be in some way bound up with the nature of writing. Thuspractices which readily submit to analysis as written forms—divinationbeing the most obvious—will tend to be those conventionally labeled“magical.” Such practices, and their practitioners, will tend to beimplicated in many of the same effects which seem bound up with thenature of writing: on the social level the common prestige awarded toliteracy will be paralleled in the prestige—awe, terror, etc.—associatedwith magical practices, while at the semiotic level, we will tend to findanalysis by division and an association with temporal control.The fact that writing necessitates and permits close reading, the processof breaking down and rebuilding a text in order to make it mean, often hasthe effect of making magicians appear to analyze their practices in amanner too often linked simply to the modern Western world. We“know” that the natives do not think the way we do, that they do notanalyze their rituals and practices in the way a modern scholar does; thefact that magicians often seem to do so threatens this facile self-superiority(expressed romantically in terms of “what we have lost”) and may be partlyresponsible for the neglect of magical thought in the history of religions.At the same time, the oppositive structure of magic in the abstract isinherently threatening, not only to modern scholars but to mainstreamintellectual culture in general. Again, we may draw a parallel to writing:writing threatens an intellectual culture which depends upon themetaphysics of presence, because writing makes obvious the absence at theheart of language. In a similar way, perhaps, magic makes ob-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE226vious—makes present, even—the instability of naturalistic and religiousmetaphysics.

To the best of my knowledge there is at present nocritical edition, which is unfortunate indeed, and has perhaps contributedto the work's being relegated to the backwaters of early modern intellectualhistory.In writing this book, I have endeavored to use the most accurate versionof De vanitate possible, requiring tedious comparison of numerouseditions, word by word. The vast majority of the thousands of textualdifferences are merely printing errors, spelling differences, and otherirrelevant trivia. In a few cases, however, apparently quite minor lacunaehave turned out to have considerable significance, rewarding the presentauthor in some slight degree for his pains.Unfortunately, there is no reliable edition of De vanitate. The versionwhich appears in the Latin Opera is one of the worst, which is a great pitysince it is comparatively readily available. Marc van der Poel notes inpassing that the earliest editions include the phrase “invictus haereticusMartinus Luterus” (one of twenty-one condemned passages) in the sectionon the inquisitors’ art; slightly later editions include “invictus haereticus”only, and still later editions drop the passage entirely. While two of theeditions used include the complete phrase, there is no reason to assumethat they are necessarily more scrupulously typeset than later editions, andas such one cannot assume that an earlier edition is a better one.It has been suggested that a complete translation and critical apparatusbe added to the Latin presented here, as the text “is too difficult even forspecialists in the field.” While I sympathize with this wish, and agreeheartily that a good translation is necessary, I am precisely the sort ofspecialist who finds it difficult. What is needed is a reliable translation andcritical edition of the entirety of De vanitate, executed by an adept Neo-Latinist able to discern the subtleties of Agrippa’s verbiage and style.
