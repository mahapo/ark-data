THE USE OF A NEW KNIFE AND CUTTING BOARD RESERVED PURELY FOR BANES IS ADVISED, IF YOU DO NOT AtREADY POSSESS ONE. INTRODUCTION Sotne of the most enduring characters of Greek Mythology cotne to us from the dark realtns below the earth, from the Halls of Hades. Names synonyn1ous with witchcraft and the dark arts rise fron1 its depths, seeking worship and recognition: Hekate, Keeper of The Keys; Kharon, The Ferryman of the Dead; The Furies, The Divine Avengers; Kerberos, the original Hound of Hell; and of course Lord Hades and Queen Persephone, distant rulers of the twilight realms. Even the highest of Olympian powers must at some titne descend to the Underworld, so different frotn their own, and seek audience of the gods who dwell in the dark. Hennes the divine messenger is the psychopotnp, the guider of souls, who traverses the shadowy caverns, golden caduceus held high, showing the dead the way to rest. Frenzied Dionysos, too, tnust I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"enter the realms of Hades in search of the dead he has lost to restore thetn to the new splendour of Olytnpus. Even the purest, most noble of souls must at sotne point enter the caverns of Avernus. Son1e are lost forever, doomed to wander with the misty shades an1ongst the asphodel, whilst other rise renewed, strengthened and full of knowledge granted by the gods themselves. This short work is a collection of sitnple tools and channs attuned to the realtn of Lord Hades. There are no cotnplex rites and formula to n1emorise, for it is true enough to say that every man finds his own way to the world of the dead. These tools are guidelines and exatnples of objects that have been created with the chthonian world in tnind, but are in no way definitive. Follow your instincts when working with the energy of these powers; the act of descent is a deeply personal one. I make no claim that these are in any way ancient tools and tricks-they are all creations of my own devices taken from sources and theories found in Ancient Greek folklore as well as traditional British witchcraft. Many rely on the sympathetic links between various items and the gods and spirits of Dis. WORKING THESE RITES Certain locales suit these workings better than others. The most obvious place to conduct ceretnonies and rites with a focus on death and the Underworld would be the cemetery. The final resting place for the remains of the living are perfect places in which to conduct your work, and also perfect places to collect vital components for your tools. Bones, dirt and stone collected 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"from these places are all invaluable. The trevia, or three way crossroads, is another perfect place to work H a dean rites, for it is said that the torch,bearing Queen Hekate haunts these places, and offerings left here will be gratefully received by her and her host. Dirt from these places can be included in several workings and tnany objects will gain power by being interred here. The cave is a natural gateway into the lower worlds. In ancient Greece n1any gods and goddesses would dwell within caves, not least Cybele, the Phrygian goddess of itntnense power. With proper illutnination and forward planning, a cave can act as the perfect space for creating and charging tools dedicated to the chthonic gods. The rivers which surround Orcus arc some of its tnost famous features, and these divine streatns have tnortal counterparts. Many sites all over the Hellenic world were purported to be the places where streatns, springs and rivers entered or left the underworld, and it is not beyond the realtns of logic to assume that any river bank or spring is an appropriate location for your rites. The water collected from springs has long been associated with the dead due to its below, ground origins and is a useful tool. Death is found at the edge of life, and as such all lin1inal places are within reach of the Underworld. Places set aside from every day reality are the perfect setting for these rites and workings, think outside the box and a door to Hades can open up almost anywhere. TIMING Timing is everything... or so we arc led to believe. Traditionally, the day it is considered best to perfonn works"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"involving the dead and their realn1 is Saturday, because this day is presided over by the planet Saturn. The waning and dark of the tnoon are also profitable for the workings of this kind, as is the astrological sign of Scorpio. The 13th August and 3Qrh Novetnber are considered the days on which the Greeks held their festivals to Hekate whilst the Romans took the 29rh of each month as being sacred to her. Modern practioners n1ay also wish to use days of recognition of the dead such as Retnen1brance Day in the United Kingdotn (11 rh of November). CHTHONIC OFFERINGS The gods of Hades were traditionally served via the pouring of libations into purposely dug pits. These libations would often include the following substances: Blood from a sacrificial anitnals, such as a black sheep Strong red wine Honey Milk Modern practitioners tnay wish to do this where circun1stances allow, however, offerings of incense are also acceptable when libations cannot be made. A tnixture of the following herbs and resins can be burnt on charcoal to appease the gods below: Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) M ugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) Storax (styrax benzoin) Poppy seeds (papaver species) 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) Balm of Gilead (Populus candicans) Cypress oil THE ORCUS CASKET For those of us who do not have ready access to the realn1s of Lord Hades, there arc various ways we can imbue an item with the essence of his realtn. One of the tnost effective ways of doing this is via the creation of an Orcus Casket. The materials used in its creation arc all sacred to, or in sympathy with the worlds of the dead, and as such it is a perfect tool for the charging of chthonic tools and charn1s. Take a wooden box and fill it with some or all of the following: graveyard dirt, powdered bone, yew wood shavings, wonnwood herb, baneful or poisonous herbs and plants. Ideally, craft the box from yew or cypress wood as these are sacred to Lady Hekate and Queen Persephone. Do not fill the casket all the way, as you will need to leave roon1 for ite1ns to be placed inside it. VESSEL OF AVERNUS An alternative to this is the creation of the Vessel of Avernus. This urnï¿½like construct acts in the same way as the Orcus Casket but is shaped as a vase or Greek urn. They are to be forn1ed fro1n red clay and given a black glaze. If desired, include finely powdered bone in the clay or glaze and whist shaping, instead of using nonnal water, use an infusion of wonnwood and yew slips in spring water. It is preferable that you make a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"lid for your Vessel so that the energies within can be contained during the charging process. Again, fill it with a cotnbination of graveyard dirt, powdered bone, herbs and banes. WATERS OF LETHE: RIVER OF FORGETTING Lethe is the River of Oblivion that winds its way thorough the fields of !-lades; the shades of the deceased n1ust drink fron1 this streatn in order to forget their mortal lives. Linked heavily to sleep, Lethe's waters flow around the caves of Hypnos, for sleep is a forn1 of forgetting which soothes all hutnan cares. For those who are unable to venture to Hades for then1selves, the following procedure can be used to tnake a useful substitute to Lethe's waters. To create the waters of this tneandering strean1, grind and beat: Rosetnary (rosmarinus officinalis), Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis), Marjoram (Majorana hortenis) Black hellebore (Helleborus niger) Bruise and mutilate the plant, but do not grind it too finely. Hellebore is a powerful daemon, use its body sparingly, it is highly toxic and will cause death if ingested-TAKE GREAT CARE IN PREPARING THESE WATERS. Hellebore has the great power of reversal, any plant it con1es into contact with will have its properties reversed. Once prepared, place these herbs in a dark glass jar or bottle. Fill the bottle until the herbs are well covered with good, strong alcohol of 45% proof or greater, and then top the rest 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of the bottle up with water fron1 a sacred spring or well. Inter this bottle in a graveyard or cetnetery for the space of the dark moon. After the three days have passed, remove the bottle and place it within an Orcus Casket or Vessel of Avernus. Every night for three weeks, remove the bottle and shake well, repeating the following hyn1n to Morpheus: To SLEEP The fumigation from a Poppy. \"Sleep, king of Gods, and men of mortal birth, Thy pleasing, gentle chains preserve the soul, And e'en the dreadful cares of death controul; For death and Lethe with oblivious strean1, Sov'reign of all sustain'd by mother Earth; For thy dotninion is supreme alone, O'er all extended, and by all things known. 'Tis thine all bodies with benignant mind In other bands than those of brass to bind: Tamer of cares, to weary toil repose, From whon1 sweet solace in affliction flows. Mankind thy genuine brothers justly deetn. With fav'ring aspect to my pray'r incline, And save thy mystics in their works divine. The Hymns of Orpheus Translated by Thomas Taylor Replace the bottle in the Orcus Casket or Avernus Vessel when you feel it has been sufficiently shaken. When three weeks have passed, exhutne the bottle one last time and decant the liquid into another, smaller vessel, straining as you do so. This bottle now contains The Waters of Lethe to be employed as you see fit. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WATERS OF KOKYTOS: RIVER OF wAILING The river Kokytos flows around the Underworld and it is the river of sorrow and pain; it is a sluggish river which bars rest to the spirits of those unburied.

Each plant is the sign of the lamentation of a god for their doon1ed lovers: Prickly Letu ce (Adonis) Larkspur petals (Hyakinthos) Calatnus (Kalan1os) Poppy petals (Adonis) Crocus petals (Krokos) Mix with ground sea salt and finely powdered tnud frotn a cetnetery or marsh and shake well.

KEY OF HORN The Oneiroi who come to sleeping men through the great gates of horn gift n1en with prophetic dreatns of revelation, whereas those who wing their way to the tnortal world through the shining gates of ivory give only false, illusory dreatns. These gates lie in the Underworld, at the edge of the realn1 of Hypnos, whence from its trees and caves the spirits of dreams, the Onerioi, fly forth as a swarm of bats into the world.
