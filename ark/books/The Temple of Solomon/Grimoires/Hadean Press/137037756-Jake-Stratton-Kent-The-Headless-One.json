This will addressits language and origins, also those of the several rites in Greek and Demotic papyri that possess similarcharacteristics and use similar terms. This aspect of the study enables us to understand a good deal aboutancient magic, but also to put into proper perspective many important events and movements in which therite has been involved in more recent times.The other aspect of the investigation follows naturally: analysis of the single most important ritual inmodern magic, known variously as The Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia, Bornless One, LiberSamekh, etc. This will include: the history of the ritual in modern times; its use by Crowley and others; itsrelation to the system of Abramelin and to the instructions of the 8th Aethyr; the qaballistic scheme viaCrowley's reconstruction; its relation to Kundalini and sexual magick; the work of the present writer andhis conclusions.Many important aspects of the study will be discussed under separate headings, although naturallythere will some unavoidable overlapping.Here follows, with preliminary notes:(1) the text of the Ritual more or less in the version described in Liber Samekh.(2) a translation of the original from the papyri.Thee I invoke, the Bornless One.Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens.Thee that didst create the Night and the Day.Thee that didst create the Darkness and the Light.Thou art RA HOOR KHUIT whom no man hath seen at any time.Thou art IA BESZ.Thou art IA APOPHRASZ.Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust.Thou didst make the Female and the Male.Thou didst produce the Seeds and the Fruit"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Thou didst form Men to love one another and to hate one another.I am N Thy prophet unto whom Thou didst commit thy mysteries the ceremonies of ALBION.Thou didst produce the moist and the dry and that which nourisheth all created life.Hear thou Me, for I am the Angel of AIWASS; this is thy true name handed down to the prophets ofALBION.Hear Me: AR, THIAO, RHEIBET, A-THELE-BER-SET, A, BEL-ATHA, ABEU, EBEU, PHI-THETA-SOE, IB, THIAO.

II 53.The original ritual was written in Greek, and is typical of materials found in both the Graeco-Egyptian papyri. Also to be considered is the presence of parallels in the demotic papyri (the latter werepublished somewhat earlier, in the Leyden Papyrus). Among occultists, Kenneth Grant ascribed aSumerian origin to the ritual, an attribution that ignores the absence of any Sumerian god-names in theritual whatsoever. There are related rituals which name Ereshkigal, but these involve prior syncretism ofEreshkigal with Hecate in the C4th BC or earlier. Grant’s attribution typifies the initial limited and overlyswift responses to the papyri among occultists, and has parallels in the academic world.The Leyden Papyrus, which has so much in common with this ritual, dates from the 3rd Century ADand was found in the tomb of a Theban magician. Thebes, it will be remembered, was the cult centre ofAmon-Ra, of whom Ankh af na Khonsu was priest. A relative of the 'Headless' ritual can be found in thispapyrus; it is an invocation of Typhon-Set and its purpose is to inflict catalepsy or death upon themagician’s enemies.A spell to inflict catalepsy.PDM XIV 675-94/Leyden Papyrus. Col. 23A) Formula. Take an asses head(1) and place it between your feet opposite the sun in the morningwhen it is about to rise, opposite it again in the evening when it goes to the setting. Anoint your right footwith set-stone of Syria and your left foot with clay, the soles (?) of your foot also, and place your rightfoot in front and your left foot behind, the head of the ass between them(2). Anoint your hand, of your twohands (palms?), with asses blood, and the two corners of your mouth, and utter these charms towards thesun in the morning and evening of 4 days, then he sleeps. If you wish to make him die you do it for 7 days,you do its magic, you bind a thread of palm fibre to your hand, a (rolled) mat (?) of wild palm fibre toyour phallus and your head; very excellent.B).

The wild ass, particularly if red in colour, was associated with Set.2. May describe ‘Sign of Set Fighting’, see illustration below which shows a very rarestatue of Set in fighting posture. Note the variation from GD form.3. The language here has precise parallels in the Headless One. ‘In the empty wind’ was translatedby Crowley in a romantic vein as 'the void place of the spirit'. Compare also 'the terrible and invisiblegod'; these are conventional forms in the rituals involving Set, particularly Set Akephalon, vide infra.4. Compare the 'ill-ordered house in the victorious city' where AC found the Stele of Revealing.5. The string of three names ‘Aktiophi(s), Ereshkigal, Neboutosouleth’ appears frequently in thepapyri, as well as individually (See PGM IV 2473, 2749, 2914; VII 317, 984, etc.). Aktiophi(s) isthought to be an epithet of Selene (identified in turn with Hecate in this period). Ereshkigal is the Queenof the Sumerian underworld, linked to Hecate and appearing in curse tablets from the 4th century BC. Themeaning of Neboutosouleth is obscure, but Nebo or Nabu is the Sumerian Mercury or Thoth, a magiciangod with underworld roles.6. Also ABRA-MENTU. As well as its connections with Thelemic magick, this name was thought tobe associated with Gnostic ideas and with Set Akephalon. This identification, which posited a Gnosticsyncretism of Set and the biblical patriarch Seth, is now thought to be unlikely. There are no positiveviews of Typhon in the Gnostic scriptures. Some relevant quotations regarding this mistaken identityappear in an appendix.This parallel ritual, which was published before the Greek papyri, placed the Headless ritual incontext. The Greek papyri contain many more such parallel rituals. The Headless One is – like it or not –closely related to a whole family of magical papyri invoking Set.Other parallel ritesThe rituals of the papyri which bear similar phrases and words of power to the Headless ritual arenumerous, forming as it were a ‘genre’ within the papyri as a whole. These rituals involve a recurringgroup of entities, Typhon and Besas prominent among them.When examined, other features common to this wider genre emerge, with and without direct"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"reference to the Headless rite. Particular phrases, praising the god invoked, recur. These are very similarto the language of the Headless rite in the papyri, recognisable too in Crowley’s redactions. There is alsoa clearly identifiable family of ‘names of power’, which it is clear are specific to Typhon. Thesehowever do not appear, by and large, in the Headless rite. The Headless ritual-names however are notunique, in particular the six words around which the rite is focused.These parallel texts appear in both the Greek and the Demotic papyri. It was in a portion of thelatter, published in Griffith’s paper, that the Headless ritual entered modern magic. Subsequently, theentire Demotic corpus was published as The Leyden Papyrus. It was in these texts in which I initiallydiscovered the existence of the genre for myself. While not exhaustive, the references below illustrate allthese points well.The ‘Powerful spell of the Bear’ (PGM IV. 1331-89) is an invocation of great interest. While thebear is the constellation sacred to Set (among other contemporary dedications), the language of the ritelinks it to the cult of Hecate. Connections are also present to the Mystery religions via the Idaean Dactyls.A conjuration of daemons integral to the rite climaxes with voces magicae. The climactic voces magicaeof the incantation commence with a familiar series. These words are identical to the six names aroundwhich the Headless rite was composed (line 1376: Aoth Abaot Basum Isak Sabaot Iao). The Typhoniannature of this ritual is clear in the use of a strip of papyrus bearing his hundred-lettered secret name.Additionally, the magician girding himself with a fibre of date palm resembles elements of PDM XIV,and both rites involve anointing the mouth.In PGM IV 3007-86 the ritual is, as it were, proto-Solomonic. The incantation contains a historiolaregarding the seal of Solomon in line 3040. More specific to our current subject is 3044-45 where themagician demands the conjured spirit inform him to which region he pertains, and lists them. Though notidentical to the Headless rite in which a similar list occurs, there is a relationship of conception. Bothrites give power over spirits from all these regions. In this case this is directly stated in line 3081 and interms more similar to our ritual: ‘and every spirit or daemon, whatever sort it may be, will be subject toyou’. The ritual is said to be Hebraic, and its supposed Semitic origin ‘explains’ the exhortation to avoidpork. It is notable that the magician observed the taboo to be rendered acceptable to a god to whosereligion and people he need not belong.Similar salient examples of the themes shared by these rites occur in an invocation of Besas (PGMVII. 222-49). In line 244 Besas is clearly identified as the headless one. In line 246 the reference to hismouth burning as in the headless rite appears (one of several recurring attributes appearing in theseconnected rites). In footnote 19 Betz comments on ‘headlessness’ – the reference to Preisendanz is dated,and belongs in the same category as Doresse on ‘Sethian gnosis’; the reference to Delatte is correct. Thatthe editor merely refers to them both is significant; he has not clarified the point for himself and hisreaders. This explains a misleading note to PDM XIV 93-114 (line 102) to be discussed below.A classic example of a ‘Typhonian’ ritual appears in PGM XII. 365-75. Interesting in many of itsdetails, these must suffice here: line 368 contains typical phrases (empty air, terrible, invisible), alongwith others resembling the language of the ritual first discussed (PDM XIV 675-94). Lines 370-373contain names of power typical of the Typhonian genre."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PGM CII. 1-17 is another ‘headless Besas’ ritual, containing typical phrases. The connection withrainwater – associated with the celestial gods - should not be overlooked (see also PGM VII 224, 319-20; V 152; LXI 7).In the demotic papyri, PDM XIV contains a wealth of relevant material. 93-114 contains a referenceto a priest wearing a nose at his feet (line 102). The editorial ‘correction’ (footnote 68) is completelyerroneous, oddly as Griffith & Thompson elucidated this point in 1904 (Leyden Papyrus Col IV note toline 8). The reference is plainly to the headless god and ‘sight in the feet’, etc. Also of interest is theappearance in 104 of the name Neboutosoualeth. XIV 150-231 gives us our typical phrases in line 196,and these converge with phrases associated with the important ‘angel’ Boel appearing in many of thevessel divination rites. This convergence is extremely important, but the precise relations of the gods andangels in question must await elucidation elsewhere. Briefly, the name Boel appears in numerousSolomonic works, where it is plainly a variant of Bael, i.e. Baal. Line 200 has an important Coptic‘gloss’ added, the name Aniel inserted at a later date after Byel (Boel). This may connect with changes inangelogical fashion reflected in the Mirror of Solomon operation in the True Grimoire. Line 213 includesa garbled rendering of the name Ereshkigal.PDM XIV 675-94 which was examined at the beginning of this section contains the same type ofphrases (683). Typhon is clearly identified and names of power typical of his rites appear.The influence of these traditions may be seen in the fact that the Headless spirit appears in the 3rdcentury Testament of Solomon and similarities of phraseology may also be detected in its opening lines:.1. Testament of Solomon, son of David, who was king in Jerusalem, and mastered and controlledall spirits of the air, on the earth, and under the earth.

At one time I was quite content with this adjustment, which has been repeated ad nauseam by manymodern writers. Having worked with this ritual and examined its history over many years, the suppositionnow appears entirely false.Since Goodwin presented this ritual to the English-speaking world in 1852, it has become part andparcel of the 'Western Tradition' represented by 19th Century revivals such as the Golden Dawn, whoincorporated it into their modus operandi. Indeed it may have been Mathers rather than Crowley whoamended it into something like the form in which we find it in Crowley’s edition of the Goetia, and inLeah Hirsig's Diary, with 'Moses' and 'Israel' as in the original, but having the 'Come thou forth' refrainsattached to each separate string of barbarous names. The Goetia edited by Crowley bears the date 1904,and we know that he was familiar with it at least two years preceding this date from entries in his diaryand references in Equinox of the Gods. Sometime between these two dates, some person or personsunknown adapted the ritual and altered the name 'headless' to 'bornless', on the assumption that since'Resh' in Hebrew means 'head or beginning' then the term 'headless’ might be read as 'thou who artwithout beginning–unborn and undying'. In other words the ‘translation’ relies on Hebrew etymology,which of course need not necessarily connect with a Greco-Egyptian ritual.This interpretation does not stand up in the light of current studies of the papyri, unavailable to theGolden Dawn. Nevertheless the subsequent history of the ritual itself is significant. The Golden Dawnused part or all of this ritual at various times, and in all likelihood Crowley's use of it derives from hisperiod of apprenticeship to Alan Bennett, since virtual quotations from the ritual occur in Liber Israfel,originally composed by Bennett, but amended by Crowley at some later date. We shall examine moreclosely its use by Crowley and his associates in our next section, but in the meantime it is enough to saythat the 'Come thou forth' refrain seems to have been adopted quite widely in invocations, and the ritual asa whole has been adapted primarily for invocation rather than exorcism.The use of the ritual by Crowley and others.Therefore I say unto thee: Come Thou forth and dwell in me; so that every my Spirit, whether of theFirmament, or of the Ether, of the Earth or under the Earth; on dry land or in the Water, or WhirlingAir or of rushing fire; and every spell and scourge of God the Vast One may be THOU. Abrahadabra!— The Invocation of HorusOf the many occasions when Crowley used this ritual two of the most significant for our purposes"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"were performed in Egypt, in 1903 and 1904. The first Crowley describes as 'an exhibition game ofmagick in the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid in November, 1903, when by his invocations he filledthat chamber with a brightness as of full moonlight. (This was no subjective illusion. The light wassufficient for him to read the ritual by.)’The next occasion in 1904 is of profound significance for Thelemites. When Crowley described 'Theevents leading up to the writing of the Book', (i.e. The Book of the Law) this was his first entry:‘MARCH 16. Tried to show the Sylphs to Rose(1). She was in a dazed state, stupid, possibly drunk;possibly hysterical from pregnancy. She could see nothing, but could hear. She was fiercely excited at themessages, and passionately insistent that I should take them seriously. I was annoyed at her irrelevance,and her infliction of nonsense upon me. She had never been in any state resembling this, though I had madethe same invocation (in full) in the King's chamber of the Great Pyramid during the night which we spentthere in the previous autumn.’(1) I invoked them by the Air section of Liber Samekh, and the appropriate God-names, Pentagrams,&c. [Crowley’s footnote. JSK]The rest, as they say, is history, but it is worth noting as we consider this momentous event thatCrowley's adaptation of the ritual to invoke the Air spirits did not apparently result in the appearance of'the sylphs' à la Comte de Gabalis. Rather it precipitated a remarkable series of events that within dayswas to produce the announcement of a ‘New Era for Mankind’ through the reception of a cryptic bookwhich encodes the formulae of the Aeon of Horus: Liber AL vel Legis. This is perhaps an indicator of thelimitations of the will of the magician, who, producing a ritual for a specific purpose, on synthetic lines,overlooks the possibility that what he is adapting has a life of its own. This ritual certainly produced asignificant result, but this did not remotely resemble the result intended. This is a point I wish the readerto bear carefully in mind in later discussions of the rite.Crowley's diaries, works and the Holy Books of Thelema themselves all stand testament to theimportance of this ritual in his magical work. There are references to it in John St. John and Rex de ArteRegia where he describes a ritual involving a) Liber Israfel, b) the Enochian Calls appropriate to theElemental Watchtowers and c) The Bornless Rite. The ritual also played a prominent part in Crowley'sinvocations of the 'Secret Chiefs' Abuldiz and Amalantrah. His first contacts with Ab-ul-diz were ratherunsatisfactory, but Crowley was told when next to invoke, and with what ritual. Accordingly, onNovember 28th 1911 at 10.38pm he opened the Temple and at 10.45pm he invoked Ab-ul-diz by theBornless Ritual – and at exactly eleven o'clock the Spirit appeared. The circumstances are somewhatsimilar to the Cairo working of 1904, with Mary d'Este Sturges playing the part of Rose Kelly, havingconfused visions which lead to an Invocation, and to a Book, for the writing of Magick in Theory andPractice was on the instructions of the intelligence contacted in this operation.In August 1920 he records yet another similar event. This time the seeress is Leah Hirsig, Crowleyperforms the Bornless Rite, and the visions become a series of conversations – this time with Aiwass,although Crowley at first suspected that either Amalantrah or Abuldiz were involved. Indeed there ishardly an important event in Crowley's magical career where the Bornless Rite was not prominent. Hiswalk across China involved performing it several times daily.

The Goetiaversion of it is written at the back of Leah Hirsig's diary, and was used by her to commence new periods,and as a preparation for visions, including the following series where she apparently foresaw theIntercontinental Ballistic Missile.January 17th 9 P.M.

The second section may well correspond to theunpublished paper, Liber Cadaveris. The final section is SSS, dealing with Kundalini, which I shallexamine in a later section of this pamphlet.These excerpts show the extraordinary versatility of this ritual, although in at least one instance, inCairo 1904, the preconceived purpose of the ritual was not even related to the (admittedly extraordinarilyimportant) results achieved. It should be borne most carefully in mind however, that although the ritualseems admirably suited to precede visionary experiments, to commence invocations of Spirits and toinvoke the Holy Guardian Angel, it undoubtedly had an original purpose, and was devised in its originalform along lines which assuredly made more sense to the composer of the ritual than to Goodwin (thetranslator) or Crowley (the adapter). I now proceed to the core of the matter, so far as Liber Samekh isconcerned, if not the other forms of the ritual.Its relation to the system of Abramelin & to theinstructions of the VIIIth Aethyr."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"I am like a black eunuch; and Thou art the scimitar. I smite off the head of the light one, the breaker ofbread and salt. — Liber VII III 34Liber Samekh stands at the centre of Thelemic magick, as the ritual par excellence of achievingKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Its central importance is to be understood interms of Crowley's mission to bring all men to this sacrament:I am indeed sent to do something. For whom? For the Universe?... What shall I teach men? And likelightning from heaven fell upon me these words: 'The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel.’Success in this operation is essentially identical with the discovery of the True Will. The precursorsof the method are to be found in The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.The Abramelin Retirement is a major magical operation in which the phrase 'Knowledge andConversation' first occurs in extant magical literature - it is to be found in a MS purporting to date from1485, translated by the able hand of Macgregor Mathers. The entire scheme of the work is outside thescope of an essay such as this. Briefly, however, the operation as then undersood extends over six months,during the first two months of which the operator rises at dawn and invokes his Angel with prayer, andmakes the study of the Holy Books of his religion his principle pastime. For the second two months, heincreases the intensity of his devotions, making his invocation at dawn and sunset. During the third twomonth period he makes the invocation at dawn, noon and sunset.The instruction in the Eighth Aethyr of the Enochian system detailed in The Vision and the Voice isaimed at the same attainment. Essentially the details of the preparation of the place and the operator arenot too dissimilar from the Abramelin scheme, but the timescale differs in that it extends over 91 days oreleven weeks. The prayer cycle is more intense than Abramelin, partially perhaps due to the shorter timespan:he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at midnight, and at sunrise. And if he be able, he shallpray also four times between sunrise and sunset... and in any case he shall pray seven times daily duringthe last week of the eleven weeks.The rubric of Liber Samekh ends with these words, which we may compare with the above:Let the Adept perform this ritual aright, perfect in every part thereof, once daily for one moon, thentwice, at dawn and dusk, for two moons, next, thrice, noon added, for three moons, afterwards, midnightmaking his course, for four times every day. Then let the Eleventh Moon be consecrated wholly to thisWork; let him be instant in continual ardour, dismissing all but his sheer needs to eat and sleep. For knowthat the true Formula whose virtue sufficed the Beast in this attainment, was thus:INVOKE OFTENSo may all men come at last to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: thussayeth the Beast, and prayeth His own Angel that this book be as a burning Lamp, and as a living Spring,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"for Light and Life to them that read therein.Crowley's use of the Bornless Rite for this purpose, as set forth in Liber Samekh, was performedover a four month period, 'invoking often' during a journey on horseback in China in 1906, two years afterthe reception of the Book of the Law. This was not the only such retirement he undertook; his relationswith his Guardian Angel involved numerous such retirements. The magical strain produced by such effortscannot be perfectly described. It involves distortions or interruptions of normal consciousness, in whichtime and the apparent laws of our day-to-day existence are meaningless and frequently suspended. Thediaries of these retirements themselves can give only an imperfect sketch of these phenomenon, by whichresistance to the consummation of this communion is broken down to the point at which the Angel canovercome our defences and finally render us passive and receptive to His force. The only analogy to thisthat is remotely suitable is the relation between the Spheres on the Tree of Life, each of which is active inrelation to that below it and passive in relation to that above. This passivity is incredibly difficult for themagician to achieve in their relation with their Angel, and the strains of the operation - against which heor she ACTIVELY struggles day by day - eventually produce a state of, if not collapse, at leastresignation. In this surrender, achieved by such pains and trials, the Knowledge and Conversation isfinally granted.The Qaballistic scheme via Crowley's reconstruction.Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not, nor laughter ofthe folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth... — AL.III.17.The attribution of the elements to the quarters in Samekh does not follow the scheme used in theother Thelemic rites, such as The Star Ruby or the Star Sapphire or even the Gnostic Mass, but retainsthe well known East = Air, North = Earth, rather than the more usual Thelemic attribution of Earth to Eastand Air to North, etc. This may be because the ritual predated Crowley's adoption of these attributions, orit may be quite simply, as Crowley himself remarked from time to time, that this operation differs in manyrespects from every other, and indeed, reverses the usual methods. Judging from my own experience withthe rite, and from various considerations arising from this work and from the orientation in the originalGraeco-Egyptian ritual, I consider it to be desirable, once one acquires perfect comprehension andcompetence with the rite, to switch the attributions as outlined in the final sections of this paper.There is no necessary connection between the ideas involved in the Barbarous Names of the Ritualand the Elements to which Crowley has ascribed them in the structure of this rite. To take an example,KOTHA meaning 'The Hollow One' is at least as appropriate to Air or Water as to Earth. Crowley and/orMathers apparently deleted at least some names and altered others. The interested student should see theGreek in Griffith’s paper or Regardie's Ceremonial Magic. This being the case, there remains thelikelihood that the six 'Names' or sections spoken of in the original – and the six correponding sections inCrowley's recension – relate to SOMETHING, which Crowley interpreted as the Four Elements andSpirit Active and Passive, but which could equally well be the Six Spatial Directions: Up, Down, East,South, West and North, or some similar pattern in common currency among Graeco-Egyptian sorcerers!Analysis of the Elemental Sections.Below may be found the various visualisations, gestures and sigils associated with the ritual."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Accompanying them are the outlines of two schemes of elemental attributions.

This is an obvious reference to tantric elements in the ritual, which we may compare with theritual called the Star Sapphire, allegedly the cause of the OTO accusing AC of revealing their sex-magical secrets. A method of arousing the Fire Snake with this ritual was described in The New EquinoxVolume 6 number 1, as well as by Francis King in his excellent work Tantra for Westerners. King also'feminises' the god invoked, on the basis that Kundalini is personified as a Scarlet Goddess in Tantricsources. In many respects this book is among the best extant for applying Tantra in a Thelemic context.That in a Thelemic context neither of us were 'exceeding our brief' is obvious from the reference to themagical weapons mentioned above, standard allegorical terms for the Lingam and Yoni in modernoccultism.I would strenuously advise anyone undertaking an Abramelin style retirement with this ritual to takevery seriously the injunctions Crowley makes in the text. Prepare yourself by reading LXV, which we canand should expand to include the Holy Books of Thelema in general, and AL in particular. You willbenefit from experience in the expansion of the Body of Light along the lines of Liber 536,BATRAXOPHRENBOOCOSMOMACHIA.The Expansion of Consciousness.Seated in the open air, let him endeavour to form a complete mental picture of himself and hisimmediate surroundings. It is important that he should be in the centre of such picture, and able tolook freely in all directions... Let him gradually add to this picture by including objects more andmore distant... Let the Practicus form a mental picture of the Earth, in particular striving to realisethe size of the earth in comparison with himself... Let him add the Moon, keeping well in mind therelative sizes of, and the distance between, the Earth and its satellite... add in turn Venus, Mars,Mercury and the Sun...the Asteroids, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune [Pluto was not discovered"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"at the time of writing. Ed.] The utmost attention to detail is now necessary, as the picture is highlycomplex, apart from the difficulty of appreciating relative size and distance...let his contemplationbecome vast as the heaven, in space and time ever aspiring to the perception of the Body of Nuit.' —Liber BATRAXOPHRENBOOCOSMOMACHIA.An alternative to this method is to use the wide focus view method found in Liber Null, coupledwith an appreciation of the Sun and Moon's position in [relation to] the Ecliptic, studying daily theastrological picture of the heavens and striving on one's walks to locate where each part, whether visibleor not, is located in relation to oneself. If the ritual can be performed outside in the country (albeitinternally or without full ceremonial) at some stage in the walk after expanding the consciousness by suchmeans, all the better.Some measure of success in the practices in Liber Nu, where the first of the Results is 'Expansion ofconsciousness to that of the Infinite' would serve the same general purpose.The analogy between these exercises and certain tantric meditations, where the operator visualisessuch vast pictures of the Universe in conjunction with the Compassion meditation (Peace to all beings),will be noticed. This practice of expansion relates to various aspects of the rite, in particular:The Assumption of God Forms.'In these invocations he should expand his girth and stature to the utmost (having experience ofsuccess in the practices of Liber 536), assuming the form and consciousness of the Elemental God of thequarter.'The Extension of the Will Symbol.The Will in this ritual is formulated visually as a phallus; 'Let then the Adept extend his Will beyondthe Circle in this imagined Shape and let it radiate with the Light proper to the Element invoked'.The Geometric Progression of Divine Names.This Will symbol is the channel for the divine names. 'Let each Word issue along the shaft withpassionate impulse... Let also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of the Shaft may plungetwice as far for the Second Word as for the First, and Four Times for the Third as for the second, and thusto the end...'. This practice may be compared with the Kundalini exercise in Liber HHH. If the operatorworks the rite in the chakras rather than the quarters, the close identity of the practices, and the reason forthe emphasis on HHH throughout the Elemental Grades, will be clear to him.The Arousal of the Fire Snake.[...]In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal cord is the Lingam... concentrate thythought of adoration in the brain... begin to awake the spine in this manner...concentrate thy thoughtof thyself in the base of the spine, and move it gradually up a little at a time...adore the brain...figureto thyself its content as infinite.

Cap. SSS."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The work of the present writer and his conclusions.'He shall await the sword of the Beloved, and bear his throat for the stroke.' — Liber VII.5.47.My own work with this ritual has extended over ten years [written in 1991], and I thus considermyself qualified to not only write this article regarding what it is and might be, but also to conclude withmy own interpretation of how it is best performed. We should remember that the original use of the riteinvolved states of possession, which we might consider in terms of willed states of possession rather thanunfortunate obsessive conditions. In such cults as Voodoo, as ably described by Maya Deren, the state ofpossession commences with a force ascending through the body, analogous if not identical with theKundalini serpent.In the course of the ritual's performance, the operator 'assumes' beast forms & 'vibrates' the Namesalong a phallic shaft of Will, 'Unto the ends of the Universe', i.e. up the spine to the brain, the body'visualised' as immense in size; each series of words relates, in ascending order, to the 'chakras', viz:Air=Groin, Fire=Solar Plexus, Water=Heart, Earth=Throat, Spirit Active = Pineal Gland, SpiritActive=Above Head. Why are the elements in this order? Surely it would make more sense to haveGenitals as Earth & Throat as Air? Yes, it would; indeed the elemental attributions to the quarters in, theStar Ruby are arranged exactly like that. But! As Crowley emphasised, the Holy Guardian Angel ritual isdifferent from and even the reverse of usual procedures. The Bornless Rite was originally the HeadlessRite, and many magicians who use the Rite, and analogous yogic and tantric processes, find the Da'athChakra or larynx is or feels 'blocked'. Qaballistically this is the Abyss. Remember all the sword and necksymbolism?Throat=Pentacle (or Platter), Genitals=Dagger (or Sword). Solve et Coagula, or 'fixing the volatile& making volatile that which is fixed', is so to speak, turning Air into Earth and vice versa. Thus theascending Kundalini passes the Da'ath centre when the 'Flaming Sword' cuts off the head. Unfortunatelyfor the Golden Dawn methodology, the 'divine white brilliance' only descends when it is good and ready;it is the 'ascending mode' which is important initially, not only throughout yogic tradition but in otherliving traditions such as Voodoo.Here follow some extracts from my own Magical Record.Retirement 1980/81In 1980 I undertook the Magical Retirement described in Samekh, involving an eleven month period(actually somewhat longer as I worked with the ritual for several months prior to the Retirement itself), asoutlined above. From the beginning I observed dawn, Noon, Sunset and Midnight and performed the Solaradorations from Liber Resh. At the appropriate stages of the retirement I performed the Bornless Riteonce, twice, three times and finally four times a day, reading the Class A, particularly AL, and interpretedthose passages that gained relevance through various states and intuitions with the aid of the HolyQaballa, in this case the E...Q....March 1 '81...

He is supposed to have an ass's head, a feature which recalls the elongated snout and longears of some African animal, with which Seth (set) is sometimes identified in Pharoanic iconography.More often he seems to be identified with a sort of headless demon whose eyes are placed in hisshoulders, *the Akephelos*.
