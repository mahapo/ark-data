The material of which I speak is a set of modified conjurations for use in Evocation of the spirits of the Black Dragon following a revelation I received when working therewith. The \"eureka moment\" in question, for those unfamiliar with Crossed Keys, came during the first of several evocations of Frimost, who is in this MS regarded as the ruler of the znd day of the operation, Tuesday. Following the appearance of Frimost, at the point when I began to ask him to identify himself as is customary in the Solomonic tradition, I was promptly chided by the attendant spirit thusly:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Why would any but the named come when the invitation to eat at your table was so replete with threats and intimidation? And why, if your intent is to ask of me a gift , would you deem it acceptable and wise to promise to torment me day after day should I not agree? I come not out of fear nor out of obligation, for over me no man has power. I come because you think to give me blood in exchange for what you seek, and that I would have.\" It was further explained that for me to call him or his brethren in the name of \"jesus\", a god in whom I do not believe from a religion I deem an insult to the intelligence of man, was clear hypocrisy and it was in no way the means by which he was bound to attend me. It was pointed out that in my own practice I have never resorted to such heavy handed tactics, having always given unto every spirit their respect regardless of their classification. This, in fact, was true. I have always been of the belief that it is not the purview of man to judge any such entity; nor is it in our own power to command them by our own name or will (save for the most powerful and ascended of Mages). Why, then, did I initially revert to these methods of treatment when fir� endeavoring to work from the Black Dragon? Simply because I felt that when working from a new text for the first time, it should be done in as closely as possible to the original manner. Thus I forwent my own experience in favor of following the text as written, until I was guided otherwise by the sprits therein. Following this moment of elucidation, I sought to recreate the workings of the Black Dragon in a way that adheres to my own belief system and my own practice, wherein the \"Demons\" called on were not chastened and commanded in the name of a god to whom they owe no allegiance, but were invited much as we would invite an Angel. In further exploration and investigation with my own Patrons, in addition to that spirit known commonly in the western tradition as the Holy Guardian Angel, I began to put together the puzzle before me, and what I learned, as expounded in Crossed Keys, was that the pseudo-piety demonstrated throughout the Black Dragon and the adjurations to both jesus and the father were, as are many from that time period, merely insulation, protecting the Magus from the prying eyes of the church and putting up a fapde of piousness to 2 detract attention from the truly contained therein.

In the interests of brevity and in keeping with the straight to the point nature of this series, I will forgo further depth and will instead summarize my findings with regard to this Grimoire to hasten our arrival at the ritual proper. The Black Dragon's power lies not in the conjurations provided therein - those are a blind intended, as stated, to give the work an air of piety. The power of the Black Dragon is in the structure in which it is presented: The Evocator first evokes the 4 Kings of the Cardinal Directions, which is to be accomplished on Sunday. In their name, the Magus then calls on the Rulers of the 7 respective days, on the day with which they are associated, in order and commencing the Monday following the initial evocation of the Directional Kings. Having successfully evoked the Kings, as well as the Rulers, and having obtained their blessings in the work as a whole, the ceremony culminates in a final rite, wherein the 11 spirits who adorn the Black Dragon's pages are called on together and an \"initiation\" takes place. Contained herein is a magickal structure and framework of which I made use in Evoking the spirits of Le Veritable Dragon Noir wherein they are given they respect they deserve, as our elders in creation and beings of a power far surpassing our own. Undoubtedly, there will be many of my contemporaries, including some for whom I have great respect, who do not share my beliefs and would contend that the traditional Solomonic methods of evocation wherein the Magus asserts his own divinity and thus subordinates the spirits to his will is the superior. While this may indeed be the case for them, it has not been the case for me. I have found that summoning \"demons\" who are, in fact, the patron deities of Ancient civilizations whose only crime is to refuse fealty and obeisance to the judea-christian god by chastising them and threatening them in the very name of that 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"god tends to inspire in them a justifiable anger. Thus, having been reminded of this belief and having had the fallacy of pretending otherwise for a series of rites pointed out to me by the evoked, I went back to what I knew, to what I believed and to what worked for me -and it proved most effective again. PREPARATIONS When first endeavoring to undertake the Rite of the Black Dragon in its entirety, The Magus will undertake a 3 full day preparatory period to begin 96 hours before the commencement of the rite. It is wise to prepare for this undertaking by advising your family and friends that for the duration, you will be incommunicado and thus unreachable, as it is of paramount importance that one not be distracted from the work at hand. The ritual proper will commence on Sunday, beginning with the Evocation of the Kings. Day 1. The Magus begins a progressive fast which commences with meals li�ited to whole foods, fruits & vegetables, etc ... In addition to the fast, 3 meditation sessions of 30 minutes each should be undertaken. If the Magus has patron gods/ goddesses, or has established contact with he who is known to the western tradition as his Holy Guardian Angel, it is beneficial and appropriate to make an offering of incense to them and make entreaty for their blessings and assistance in the forthcoming work. Day 2. Progressive fast continues, limiting the day's nourishment to fruits, vegetables and pure water (such as Poland spring or another such brand). On this day the Magus will clean the temple physically, using Florida Water, \"Holy Water\" if it suits his will, or in my case 4 :;; ... water from the Nile River. 1 The� workis also constructed, consisrU.l will leads him to adorn it with � was created from homemade Na� found online.

The circle in my case was created from homemade N atron, recipes for which can be readily found online. The temple is also setup, as shown in the illustration below. Daily meditation sessions continue with 3 repetitions. Repeat offerings as aforementioned, if applicable. Day 3. Abstinence from all forms of distraction including TV, Internet, Phone, etc... This day is spent in meditation, reflection and relaxation to prepare oneself for the following days work. Progressive fast culminates with all intake besides water being ceased 24 hours prior to the rite. In a suitable planetary hour, the temple is to be cleansed of all outside influences Magickally. In my case this was done through utilization of a Graeco-Egyptian rite which I've previously provided on my blog and will therefore not repeat here for the sake of brevity, instead urging the reader to look for it there if he does not have a method of doing this with which he is familiar. Also acceptable are the \"banishings\" taught ad nauseum in the Golden Dawn traditions and their derivatives. 1 With the advent of the internet, the modern Magus finds himself uniquely positioned to seek out and obtain such items. The means by which I did so was by going on craigslist's Egypt site, through it contacting a U.S Civilian Contractor with one of our military's defense contracted groups, and offering him a decent sum of money to obtain it for me, while also photographing himself as he does so. You will find it prudent to improvise when using methods such as this, when it comes to explaining why you need such a thing. I explained that my wife was Egyptian and for our anniversary I wanted to give her her wish, to again walk on the sands of Egypt and bathe in the waters of theN ile, and since I couldn't afford to vacation there this was my idea. Social Engineering is of great use to the practitioner in such situations, and it teaches us that when given such an opportunity, to take part in such a romantic story, people usually will. 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• The East of the circle; Here are placed the name and/or a sigilized representation of the King of the East, King Magoa and an appropriately chosen candle & cone of incense • The Northernmost point, laid out as the East, with incense and candle appropriate to King Amaymon. • The West, laid out and dedicated to King Bayemon • The South, to King Egym • The altar • At the left, the book The Black Dragon.

Summon the divine and preternatural power from within you and take control of it. See and feel the sky part as if being slowly torn until a rip exists, behind which you see only shadows of beings that dwell therein. From the rip in the fabric of reality above comes a streak of lightning, electric blue and incomprehensible in its destructive power. The lightning strikes the Crown atop the Magus' head, transferring all its divine and immeasurable force to him. Feel it throughout your body, as if every inch of your flesh was simultaneously aflame. See and feel the earth underfoot tremble for several moments, finally beginning to split beneath you as did the sky, torn as if by an inconceivable power below.

This fulfills and surpasses the aspirations of the Middle Pillar. The second portion uses the \"Fire of Fire, First of the Fire Within Me\" mentioned so frequently in PGM, harnessing it and turning it into a barrier, barring the intrusion of any undesired influences and protecting the Magus from all harm from without, thus again not only fulfilling but also surpassing the aspirations of a traditional rite - the LBRP /BRH combination. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"and enveloping you, permeating you to your own core.

Let the Magus step forward to the Easternmost point, lighting a cone of incense there while speaking the modified conjuration of the King of the East, Magoa, as follows: I conjure and evoke you, 0 Powerful Magoa, King of the East and Ruler of Air, that thou mayest hear me and attend me this nite!

The Grimoire tradition and the manuscripts from which it was born have much to offer the modern practitioner, if he is willing and insightful enough to experiment therewith, thinking outside the box and creating new ways to work with these ancient texts. Although it would not be evident upon casual perusal of the Grimoires, I think it entirely likely that Grimoiric Magick was, even during the period in which its manuscripts were penned, practiced in ways vastly divergent from what lies on the pages, and it therefore behooves us to experiment in an attempt to recapture whats missing. While I have herein provided enough of my own ritual for the reader to begin the rite immediately, it is my hope that he will nonetheless use it only as a reference and from it become inspired to create his own adaptation, following no one elses trail, whether mine or the original authors, but rather blazing his own . 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"i, � CROSSED KEYS being a chimeric binding of both The Black Dragon and the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III in a fresh translation by grimoire magician Michael Cecchetelli.
