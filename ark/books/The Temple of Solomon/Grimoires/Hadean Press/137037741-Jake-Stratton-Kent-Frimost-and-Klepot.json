Such a snap judgement would be mistaken; his powers are far wider and his nature considerablymore interesting. However, let us start by mentioning these powers, as he is certainly employed in suchmatters.Frimost has power over what concerns men and love. He has power over women and girls, andwill help you to obtain their use. He can excite or obstruct all human passions, can extinguish oraugment the passion of girls, and provoke miscarriage in women.The Grimoire of Honorius gives him the additional name of Nambroth, and urges the magician to treathim very respectfully, also to give him the first stone the magician finds. This is but one of severalindications that this is a particularly powerful and important spirit. The advice to treat him veryrespectfully is reminiscent of the advice given by the Goetia of Solomon regarding Asmodeus, who mustbe called standing and with head bare. It is well to transfer this advice over to Frimost. Asmodeus ofcourse is particularly important in the legends of King Solomon, and has been called ‘the second orsmaller Satanas’. So too in different editions of the Grimoire of Honorius the operations of the day ofMars are variously said to be under the rule of either Frimost or Belzebuth.*The accompanying diagram bears the name Nebirots, another Verum spirit.While Honorius is not always a reliable source, in this case there appears to be value in the variants.On some – though not all – occasions when working with Frimost I have been advised to include herbs ofBelzebuth as well as Frimost in the incense.Besides this, there is the interconnection of his name with that of Klepoth, who in Brazilian syncretismis equated with Exu Pomba Gira, the female partner of Lucifer. In the True Grimoire Klepoth presidesover the hazel rod, while Frimost’s sigil is inscribed on the elder rod. Here too plainly his role is that of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"a ‘stand in’ for a chief, in this case the Emperor of the spirits. Through such details his importance in thesystem begins to be revealed. By examining his role throughout the Grimoire, clearly Frimost’s status ishigher and his powers far broader than appears in the straightforward catalogue of powers."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE STRONG ONEIn my True Grimoire I give the following explanation of his name:Frimost: Latin Frimotus, roaring, snorting, noise. Note however that Lansdowne 1202 givesFrimost’s name as Frimoth, and on the blade of ‘the knife with the black hilt’ in The Key ofSolomon appears the name ‘PhRIMThON’, presumably a form of “PRIMEUMATON whichMoses named and invoked, and there fell a great and severe hail throughout the land of Egypt,destroying the vines, the trees, and the woods which were in that country”. Frimost’s name alsoappears among the demons of the days of the week in some editions of the Grimoire of PopeHonorius.More significantly in some respects, the name Frimost is essentially the Latin equivalent of the GreekBrimos. This is a title of Dionysus, and the shorter form Brimo is a title of Persephone and Hecate. Hencethe cry in the Mysteries of Eleusis:“Our Lady hath brought forth a Holy Son: Brimõ to Brimos”.This is interpreted, ‘the Strong to the Strong’. Hence the title of this booklet, ‘Frimost: theStrong Spirit’, underlines his association with Dionysus in chthonic mode. He incarnates not themisleadingly languid and feminine Dionysus, but the lord of the panther, the bull, the snake andthe fire. We recall too the ability of Dionysus to sweep whole female populations into tranceand ecstasy. Through his inspiration they abandoned their conventional lives in the city, leavingtheir meekly performed duties to follow the god into the wild places of the earth. Thus we mayjustly deem Frimost’s power over women indicates a very different conception from that orprocurer or pimp.When I see this spirit in human or anthropoid form, he emanates confident strength and composure. Noviolent shouting or threatening gestures, but a calm stillness, eloquently expressive of a truly formidablepower. There is in this the essence of male beauty in one of its most compelling forms. We see this in thegreatest athletes, true men of action with nothing to prove. Thus, far from being a mere sexual bully onbehalf of frustrated males, Frimost has qualities deeply attractive to many women. So too, some femalemagicians would gain much from working with him."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FRIMOST BY JUSTIN BEDWELLFrimost’s name in the Brazilian cult of Quimbanda is Exu Quebra-Galho. The literal meaning isbranch breaker, but it refers to his power to decisively resolve problems facing the magician, inparticular those of the heart. Some images of him depict him literally breaking a branch, but themeaning is nevertheless symbolic. The symbolism derives from a Brazilian expression; whensome one has overcome difficulties they have ‘broken the branch’.In Western magic Frimost is associated with the fourteenth Lunar Mansion, 17 degrees of Virgo to theend of the Sign. In the modern schema the animal symbols of this mansion are the Osprey and the He Goat.The latter of these has very clear associations, particularly with sexuality and the traditional image of thedevil. The osprey too is replete with folklore, and is a powerful sea bird. Frimost’s strength and hisassociations with water are both visible in this attribute.This Mansion nowadays contains the Zodiacal degrees corresponding to stars of the Great Bear (UrsaMajor). This is very significant as it again connects Frimost with Asmodeus, who the Testament ofSolomon attributes to this constellation. Another important association of this constellation is with theGreco-Egyptian god Typhon-Set.In this constellation two stars in particular have magical associations as follows:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Cor Caroli (Chara, Dubhe) corresponding to 24:34 Virgo. In astronomy this star is called Alpha UrsaMajor. This star is martial in nature. In natal astrology it confers destructive tendencies, arrogance andconquest; also some psychic ability and talent for astrology. These powers are appropriate to Frimost,and if he is the ruling demon of the nativity they will be conferred upon the native.Another star in the constellation has a sigil and correspondences listed in Agrippa.This is Alkaid (Benetnash), Tail of Ursa Major corresponding to 25.31 Virgo. Of this is is said that it‘availeth against incantations, and maketh a man secure in his travels’. For all this it is a malefic star, butone whose powers may be harnessed. This is a pattern well-known in mythology and magic, where aspirit may have powerful destructive energies, but be propitiated and become a protector.Appropriately to a constellation pointing to the Pole, the stone of this star is the lodestone. This, themagnet, is much used in magic ancient and modern (among the Greeks and in Hoodoo for example). Themetal lid of a jar used for incense of Frimost may usefully have a lodestone attached to its underside.Such a stone may also obviously be used in erotic spells in which his aid is invoked.The plants corresponding are chicory (found particularly at the roadside and for magic ideally at acrossroads), mugwort and flowers of periwinkle. These may all be used in his incense, along withfrankincense, all well-ground together. He is also fond of chicory coffee, which he will occasionallyrequest in return for services rendered.On occasion it is also appropriate to add herbs attributed to Belzebuth to the incense of Frimost; theseare Lady’s Thistle and Woodruff.Another traditional attribute of this star, very appropriate to Frimost, is the tooth of a wolf. This can bethe actual tooth or the frequently found jewel stone in its shape.The colours associated with Frimost are a complex group, and underline his nature and powers. Hisconnection with the seventh day of creation (Saturday) gives him the colours Red and Black. These arealso the standard goetic colours, since they represent the ‘malefic’ planets Mars and Saturn. This heraldryrepresents among other things his importance in the hierarchy, and his connections with the two malechiefs in various roles.He also has Mercurial associations, so that Purple is connected with him. Mercury is connected withaggressive love magic, as for example in the Natural and Supernatural Secrets of the True Grimoire.He is also associated with blue, as his element is water. It should be remembered that the astrologicalruler of water is Mars, the ruler of Scorpio. This, rather than the more feminine aspects of the element, isthe key to this association.Lastly, in the English Qaballa the Divine Names to be invoked and written upon talismans whenworking with Frimost are Hrumachis, Jesus, Bes, Isis and Hua-Inri.HIS SIGILThe sigil of Frimost forms an integral part of the conjuring method of the True Grimoire, as it isengraved upon one of the two wands employed in its ritual. It is also employed in various spells, but for"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"now our focus is the wand.The Wands: used in purification of the circle, and in invocations.You make the Baton of Art from elder wood that has never borne fruit, and cut it with a singlestroke on the day and in the hour of Mercury at the Crescent Moon. And you engrave upon it theSeal of Frimost.Then you make a similar rod of virgin hazel on the day and in the hour of the Sun and youengrave upon it the Sigil of Klepoth.These wands may be usefully compared with those in the Key of Solomon, Book II Ch. VIII. The elderwand is there referred to as the Staff, and alternatives to elder are given, namely rosewood and cane. Allthree of these woods share the ability to be hollowed out. This is an important feature of the elder wandthat can be employed in various ways such as directing of smoke or breath, and embellishment withherbal sprigs.For our present purposes however it is important to note the status of Klepoth as the Verum counterpartof ‘Exu Woman’ in Quimbanda. This female spirit is an important spirit, of whom a fuller account followsin this booklet. In the meantime the pairing with Frimost in this context strongly underlines his status asoutlined above.What else can the instructions for making the wand tell us? Firstly there is the timing of the ritual, theday and hour of Mercury. This time is encountered very frequently in Solomonic ritual, particularlyinstrument making, so does not apparently tell us very much. However, contrasting it with the wand ofKlepoth, made in the day and hour of the Sun, does take us a little further. The day and hour of the Sun areconnected with prophecy, particularly through their association with Apollo. This is apt, as the wood thiswand is made from is hazel, much used in divining. The days and hours of Mercury are commonlyemployed precisely because Mercury is the planet associated with magicians and magic.ElderThe elder wand bearing the sigil of Frimost is replete with significance. The Latin name of the Elderis Sambucus Nigra, it is widespread in Europe, the Middle East and North America.As with all botanicals in the grimoires, its folkloric associations are the key to understanding its roleand importance in the scheme of things. Such a study also reveals a good deal about Frimost. Thereappear to be two layers of folklore to the elder; while there may be other factors at work, by and largethis suggests a layer of pagan symbolism overlaid by later Christian associations. In the first layer its roleis positive and protective, while in the other the reverse is the case. Despite the Christian theology whichsuffuses the grimoires, it appears to be the older layer which explains the importance of the botanicals,and the elder wand is a specific instance of this.The elder tree has many folkloric associations with protection of houses from witches and evil spirits,often placed outside the back door of a house (sometimes at the front). It is connected with fire, theAnglo-Saxon root of the name ‘Æld’ means fire, while the Low Saxon equivalent Eldrum is connected"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"with fire chambers and furnaces. This is not because the wood is good fuel – it is not. However elderrods hollow out easily and can then be used to blow a fire into life. The pith may also make good tinder.This symbolism connects with the legend of Prometheus, who brought fire from heaven in a hollow wand.Although a different ‘stalk’ performed this task it is interesting to note that it was the same wood as thatforming the typical Dionysian wand. As the name Frimost connects with a title of Dionysus this is unlikelyto be mere coincidence.SPELLSThe power of Frimost described in the True Grimoire makes him eligible for works of ‘aggressive’love magic. This type of magic is common in the Greek Magical Papyri; many examples from that sourcemay readily be adapted for work with him. Another spell, published in my edition of the grimoire,involves another kind of magical aggression.Death Spell by Magick ImageMake a wax doll representing the person you wish to destroy, slit the head, chest and stomachand insert the sigils of Frimost, Guland and Surgat. Impale the image head to foot and turn overthe brazier saying: ‘It is not my hand which scorches thee, it is the hand of Frimost whichscorches thee; It is not wax which I scorch, it is the head, heart and spleen of N..., that Iscorch’.Operations of this type are known in Solomonic magic as Works of Wrath and Chastisement. This is atype of magic to which Frimost is equally well-suited, and the two demons named in the spell above areappropriate henchmen for him in this role.Aggressive Erotic MagicThe True Grimoire is clear that all its spells operate by means of the spirits. Several examples aregiven in which this is explicit, while others are left for the reader to adapt as appropriate. Among theNatural and Supernatural Secrets is a classic example of aggressive love magic, its precedents going backto the Greco-Egyptian magical Papyri. Among these older examples of the genre are several whichinvolve the writing of magical formulae or the drawing of images upon a sea shell: PGM VII. 300a-310;PGM VII. 374-76; PGM VII. 467-77.From the context and the nature of the formulae employed it is clear that the shell represents aconnection not with Aphrodite but with Typhon. He is, among other things, the ruler of salt water; theconnection of Frimost with both Typhon and water has been shown above. These spells therefore are anexcellent basis for composing rites involving an invocation of Frimost and the writing of his sigil upon theshell.When the Moon waxes in either Aries or Taurus take a seashell and write the names and the image ofTyphon with the blood of a black ass (other forms specify myrrh ink, and the two may be magicallysynonymous). Say over it these words:‘I adjure ye shell, by those appointed to administer the Punishments, attract her, NN, daughter ofNN (mother’s name) letting her have no sleep until she come to me NN (state what you wish).Tarry not nor refuse me but attract her NN with her soul and heart on fire, speedily, speedily,now, now (state what you wish)’"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Relieving the Pain of Past LoveThe more benign side of Frimost’s nature is revealed by an operation I undertook with him some yearsago. I was happily involved with a new partner, but the pain of a past relationship was still with me. I feltunfairly treated and could not ‘let go’ of the unpleasant feelings and anger the previous lover had left mewith. A little lateral thinking later and I settled on Frimost as a likely source of help. My divinationconfirmed this intuition, and I duly set up a conjuration. This was not too difficult as I already had a pactwith Frimost. Nevertheless I put everything into it, laying my canvas circle out: performing a full openingvia Liber Pyramidos, complete with purifications and consecrations. I then conjured Frimost and mademy petition – that the woman concerned would no longer have any hold over my feelings. This wasgranted, as confirmed by use of the pendulum during negotiation with the spirit. This done I shared thefour part sacrament with the spirit and closed the ritual. From that day to this I have felt little besideindifference toward the former cause of emotional pain."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"KLEPOTHHER NATUREThe True Grimoire informs us that Klepoth is a subordinate spirit of Agliarept, who in turn is a deputyof Lucifer. So too one of the paired wands of the evocatory method bears her sigil, as the other does thatof Frimost. The grimoires are sparse sources regarding the background mythos of the spirits, but theseindications should prepare us for the larger picture. In the Brazilian magical cult known as Kimbanda sheis syncretised with Exu Pomba Gira, a beautiful female ‘demon’ and the lover of Exu Lucifer.Klepoth has more than a little in common with Lilith in Middle Eastern tradition. So too she can becompared with Erzulie Mapyang, a Petro loa of the Voodoo pantheon who – in New Orleans magic –protects and assists prostitutes. The very name Klepoth is reminiscent of the Hebrew ‘qlipoth’ the pluralof qlipah, the literal meaning of which is harlot. Such terms are commonly used for forbidden relationswith ‘strange gods’ in the Old Testament, and of course none were more forbidden than strangegoddesses. While appropriate to the association with Pomba Gira, no exact use of the term is necessarilyimplied; in context it may simply mean ‘spirit’. Alternatively Brazilian tradition includes a variant name,Klepta, which could indicate a Greek root meaning thief.The description of her powers in the various editions of the True Grimoire is as follows:Klepoth can turn a 1000 turns, when dancing with her companions and will make them hearbeautiful music, which one will believe is real. If you wish, in passing she will whisper in yourear the cards of those who are playing with you. According to others: Makes you see all sorts ofdreams and visions; and others still: knows all arts of divination, especially by crystal, cards,mirror and dice.This description is tantalising in its implications; despite its brevity it is replete with fascinating hints.There is more than a suggestion that her relations with the magician will exceed the usual clichédunderstanding. She is not going to dance with these ‘companions’ or for that matter whisper in your earwithout a greater degree of intimacy than envisaged in supposedly traditional ceremonials. It isimmediately obvious that, separated by bounds of circle and triangle, such contacts could not occur.My experience in conjuring Klepoth confirms this impression of deviation from the ‘usual’ spirit"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"contact in Western terms. At a gathering of magicians some years ago a conjuration with full ceremonywas performed at a very secluded location. After suitable preliminaries an invocation of Lucifer wasperformed and both his deputies conjured, before their subordinates were summoned to confirm amultiple pact. The details of the rite itself need not concern us here, suffice it to say it was successful, andproceedings continued from there.Klepoth was among the subordinates who agreed to the pact, so at a later point of the conclave weperformed a ritual divination in which she was – so to speak – consulted. So began an extraordinaryseries of events. It began with several magicians holding a single pendulum over a circle of letters on atable. A very coherent conversation with Klepoth certainly occurred, but that was by no means the mostinteresting or memorable experience of the night.As the divination proceeded it became increasingly obvious that one of the magicians – a woman – wasincorporating the spirit. The pendulum and other equipment thus became redundant. One of us waspossessed by Klepoth and was speaking and wished to be spoken to directly. She was not happy, butneither was she particularly hostile. Adapting to events, the spirit was placated and made to feel welcomeamong us. As events unrolled over some hours, a male member of the group was also possessed. Thenanother person who happened to touch him was possessed ‘by contagion’.No simple banishing or license to depart was effective, indeed it was plain the spirit was – in a veryladylike way – offended by such terms!Eventually her needs and opinions regarding our approach to her were ascertained. The earlier ritualwas then ‘reconvened’ with some fast thinking adaptations. Klepoth was offered a very comfortable seatwithin the circle (as the male magician – the only one present familiar with possession states – had sinceregained his senses, ‘she’ now consisted of two possessed female magicians). Klepoth was addressed notwith the formal authoritarian tones of the grimoires, but as to a sensitive and sophisticated woman, andoffered flowers, chocolates and fine wines. Satisfied, she eventually took her leave, more or less.A cloth that she understood as given to her remained ‘contagious’ for some time after this ritual. Itinduced possession on several occasions, until its supposed human owner took suitable steps to as it werereturn it to Klepoth with additional offerings.Although inclined to be experimental and progressive, adapting to experiences such as these involved avery steep learning curve for these Western magicians. It was the first indication that approaching thespirits of this system in ways more familiar in Voodoo and other New World traditions was both possibleand welcomed by the spirits themselves.Nevertheless, these events should be taken as a warning that these spirits are not to be taken lightly.They are powerful and potentially dangerous, and perfectly capable of taking modern western magiciansoutside their ‘comfort zone’. On the other hand this same ‘comfort zone’ is the result of decades in whichfalse or incomplete ideas have been current concerning spirits and spirit work. The magical revival hasbeen guilty of many ‘sins of omission’. Chief among these is failing to embrace the wisdom of LivingTraditions, existing often on their own doorstep, through racism and arrogance. It is important torecognise that venturing outside the limits set by past failings is both useful and necessary if our magicaltraditions are to fully recover from centuries of neglect and ‘scientism’.KLEPOTH AND HER STARSThe Western astrological correspondences of Klepoth involve the Fifteenth Lunar Mansion, its degrees"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"and stars. This Mansion, significantly, begins at zero degrees of Libra (0.00.00 Libra to 12.51.26 thereof).In the Solar Year this corresponds with the Autumn Equinox of the Northern Hemisphere, while a LibraMoon is approaching its ‘Burning Way’ (‘Via Combusta’). The impersonal astrological lore of ViaCombusta conceals a mythological spiritist base. Ancient enough to precede the separation of the SignsLibra and Scorpio from the single vast constellation of the Scorpion (whose ‘claws’ are Libra’s scales).Naturally zero Libra falls opposite the Aries point, representing the Spring Equinox (in Nporthernterms, the seasons are reversed in the South, though naturally the Equinox points remain ‘criticaldegrees’). This placing reminds us that in Quimbanda Klepoth is paired with Exu Lucifer, thus wereconnect with the mythic core underlying the math of astrological data.The stars occupying this Mansion in the current era include Edasich at 03.31.04 Libra. Termed IotaDraco, this is an orange star, identical with Al Dhiba (in 15th century sources) and Al Dhih, the MaleHyaena in the 13th, later corrupted via Ed Asich to our Edasich. In early January this region emits theQuadrantid meteors. The star is also named in Chinese sources. Its proximity to Thuban, and position inDraco make it a significant ‘Typhonian’ star.Another important star in this mansion is Gienah Corvi. Of the nature of Saturn/Mars, its oldunprecessed position of 7 Libra still has some currency in traditional circles (its relation to Via Combustais a likely contributor to this attachment). Tradition aside, its precessed position of 10:44 Libra shouldreally be preferred.Magically this star can be invoked to confer or inflict ‘naughty dreams’. Talismans made under itsauspices can also expel evil spirits or gather them together and are also good against the malice of men,devils and winds. This reputation is stated more baldly by modern astrologers, who consider it to bestowcourage. Agrippa calls it the Wing of the Crow, and his older sources associate it with stones ‘such as areof the colour of black onyx stone’, with henbane and comfrey, and the tongue of a frog. All of these maybe employed in workings with Klepoth under this star.Some of these associations may involve henbane’s power as a potent clitoral stimulant and a likelyingredient of witches flying ointments.Another important star in this mansion, with a pedigree in stellar lore thousands of years BC, isVindemiatrix (Epsilon Virgo) at 9.48 Libra. 700 years ago it marked the boundary between Virgo andLibra. A ‘mischief making star’ in medieval Arab astrology, it is nowadays a prominent significator ofWidowhood in natal charts. It is connected too with loss and depression, also with witch hunts. Howeverit also predisposes to study and learning, mysticism and the occult.Klepoth is most certainly not to be confused with a typical ‘love goddess’; even though Libra is ruledby Venus, it is as well to recall that it is also the exaltation of Saturn. Plainly the female partner of Luciferis not a totem for happy mortal wives. The associations of Vindemiatrix suggest a Lamia-like sorceressfigure, lurking behind the impersonal degrees and numbers and their tabulated meanings.The Fifteenth Mansion has occult inter-relations with the Twenty-first. The spirit of this Mansion isHumots, a learned spirit who assists the magician as regards rare and mysterious books. The stellarassociations of this spirit’s ‘Mansion’ are manifold but one in particular stands out in relation to Klepothand her connection with Draco. This is Eltanin, ‘The Dragon’s Head’, also called Rastaban, at 26.35.27of Sagittarius. Known to astronomers as Gamma Draco, it is one of the Eyes of the Dragon. In early Egypt"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"it was worshipped as representing Isis. Prior to this Apet, Mut, Taurt and Sekhet were all thought to bedifferent names of the Goddess of this star. In other words the Eye of the Dragon was associated withmajor female deities in ancient Egypt from the earliest times.In later Greco-Egyptian magic the Lunar Mansions were seen as expressing the universality of Hecate.In this role she was seen as a female and lunar pantheistic deity comparable with the solar and maleHelios or Abraxas. The Mansions played the same role as her symbols as the solar months and days didfor them. In this schema the 15th mansion was symbolized by the Egyptian Baboon; in modern attributionsthe symbol of the Pelican has been added as an alternative. Either may be employed in the ‘heraldry’ ofKlepoth, or as symbols in rites under her auspices.So too nominally each Mansion corresponds with one of the seven days of the week, or on anotherlevel the Seven Days of Creation. The Day of Creation proper to this Mansion is Sunday, as befits itsconnection with the Equinoctial point. The colours, to be used in talismans or altar decorations etc., areGold with Silver and Green.The Hazel RodOf the two wands employed in the rituals of the True Grimoire, one is traditionally of hazel andmarked with one or more sigils of Klepoth. As seen earlier the other, attributed to Frimost, is of elder andis held in the hand during rituals of evocation. This is its plain purpose when employed separately fromthat of Klepoth. Both are held, one in each hand, during the preparatory confessional stage of the rite. Notspecified but implicit is the use of the wand of Klepoth in divinatory rituals, for example with the MagicalMirror prepared in her honour.Hazel is replete with folkloric associations, and a suitable tree could be incorporated into the ‘magicalgeography’ of the magician’s environment. This tree may then be visited and honoured as part of themagical relationship with Klepoth and perhaps other spirits with whom she has a working relationship.All this should be thoroughly investigated and confirmed before being incorporated into your magicalroutine.HER SIGILSItalian ‘dancing’ sigilFrench ‘divining sigil’ inscribed on the wandCONJURING KLEPOTHAmong the spells in the family of texts known as or based on the True Grimoire are the following.First we give this one which conjures Klepoth."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"For hearing a pleasant music.[From the Third Book of Solomon]To hear beautiful music inscribe in a circle the sigil of Klepoth, and say the 11 wordsfollowing:ADOR. KLEPOTH. CHELATH. MIGAROTH. CABOT. SILMA. SIRATH. SERNCHIEL.ROTHO. MARON. COLLEN.And quickly afterwards you will hear pleasing music.This involves another significant departure from the simplistic view of grimoire magic. Here the sigilis drawn inside a magic circle to produce a magical result (other instances in the same genre confirm thisuse of the circle). This use of sigils, while not identical to veves, firmas etc., is also not dissimilar. Thesigil of the spirit is drawn, a manifestation follows; this emphasis on sigils is very distinct throughout theTrue Grimoire. In the meantime this spell provides us with a very useful ‘mantra’ for calling Klepoth, andin benign mode.THE MIRROR OF KLEPOTHThere is a section in the Natural and Supernatural Secrets in the True Grimoire concerning theMirror of Solomon. For the ritual in its original form consult the grimoire. What concerns us here isKlepoth’s association with vision and divination, including the use of a magical mirror; an adaptation ofthe original rite was plainly envisaged by the compositor of the grimoire. The beginning of the work withthis mirror commences:‘When you perceive the new Moon during the first hour after sunset’.Make the mirror facing the Moon at a window (or other suitable place). It should be made of:‘a shiny and well polished plate of fine steel, slightly concave’.An ideal basis for this is a Feng Shui mirror, whose wooden frame can be repainted and marked withthe appropriate divine names, sigils, etc.‘and write on it with the blood of a white pigeon, in the four corners, the names “Jehova,Eloym, Metraton, Adonay’.The ‘blood of a white pigeon’ used for the names can be substituted with Doves Blood ink, a Hoodoostaple the title of which is plainly inspired by the grimoires. Alternative divine names may be selectedfrom the English Qaballa if the operator is familiar with that system. Other options include the names ofthe Four Elemental Kings. Complete this preparation with the consecration method employed for allinstruments in the grimoire, substituting ‘mirror’ for ‘instrument(s)’. Be careful not to splash liquiddirectly on the steel – most kinds of holy water are not good for metal. Add a suitable petition for Klepothto appear in the mirror at the end of the words of consecration.Next make an incense offering and say:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"“I burn this offering of frankincense in the name of and to the honour of Klepoth; that she maygrant my wish and reveal herself to me in this mirror”Recite this three times, and afterwards, blow on the mirror as many times, and say:“Come Klepoth, come, and let it be your good pleasure to be with me by your will, come to me,N (say your name over the mirror), and reveal to my eyes those things which are hidden fromme.”After saying and doing the above, raise your eyes towards Heaven and say:“O God of gods, the cause of all things, grant my prayer that Klepoth comes to this mirror”When you have finished doing these things, make the sign of the cross on yourself and on the mirror, onthe first day and the following days, continuing for a period of forty-five days. And at the end of this timeKlepoth will appear.Note that forty-five days is not always necessary to make the mirror; often she will appear on thefourteenth day, following the operation, depending on the devotion and fervour of the operator. When sheappears to you, request of her what you desire, and also pray to her to appear any time that you mayinvoke her and to grant your desires.After this process is complete, when you wish to see in this mirror and obtain what you desire, it is notnecessary to recite all the above orations; but after perfuming, say over it: “Come, Klepoth, come, and letit be your good pleasure...” etc.The invoking mantra from the spell for music is useful to strengthen the link with Klepoth and to focusthe mind when using the mirror. It may be written with the same ink on a slip of clean paper during thepreparation and kept with the mirror.When you have seen and spoken with her say:‘I thank you, O Kleppoth, that you come and satisfied my request. Go in peace, and return whenI call you’.When not in use:‘Put the steel in a clean white linen cloth.’If a shrine to the spirits is being maintained, including Klepoth specifically, then the mirror should bekept there. It is to be treated as her possession, and only consulted in work with her. If the mirror can behung from a tack in this location and a chair placed before it when in use, it is better.The effects of this operation vary from one operator to another. Some will see Klepoth and speak to herin a fairly straightforward fashion. Others will find their psychic abilities enhanced by the process, butwithout the mirror taking a noticeably active role in their manifestation. Dreams will likely be significantduring the process, and may indeed take the place of visions in the mirror. The whole process may besupplemented and bolstered with mugwort tea.In English Qaballa the names invoked or written upon talismans – or indeed the Mirror of Solomon –are Horus-Ahathoor, Nuit or Apep, Zagreus or Abrahadabra, Titan and IAO-Marsyas."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"VISIONS OF KLEPOTHMy own employment of the magic mirror extended over many days magical work. In the course of thiswork I was granted several recurring visions of Klepoth, verified by employment of the pendulum andconsultation with Scirlin (the ‘spirit guide’ and intermediary of the entire True Grimoire method). Therewere three images which came again and again, all of which were confirmed as images of the spirit in thisway. These are important clues to her complex nature, and should be carefully noted.1. A full length vision of a beautiful naked woman with tanned skin and thick black hair. Shewas standing with arms raised and her back to the viewer. The setting too was exotic, the wholebeing reminiscent of her Brazilian identity.2. A portrait vision, of a very pale ‘Moon Goddess’ with a pointed chin and slanted eyes. Theimpression was not of a human, and the background was dark.3.

This once famous Grimoire, until recently much neglected and undervalued, is one of thefew surviving links in the West to an all but lost tradition. Under a thin veneer of terminology borrowedfrom its enemies, the Inquisition and their ilk, lurks a potent and pre-Christian system of evocation.Unlike the Grimoires themselves, the type of magic encouraged here is thoroughly Spiritist, in commonwith modern African traditions and those of mixed African, Amerindian and European origin in theAmericas. The view of the spirits is generally respectful, and the company of some of them is distinctlyencouraged and welcomed. The existence of difficult, ‘hard’ or even hostile spirits is recognised; butothers have simply been unjustly demonised in Western cultural contexts. The Grimoire, while maskingitself as a handbook for controlling the former, is in reality far broader in its scope and involves both, asdid its ancient predecessors prior to the demonisation of magic and the entities with which it deals.The supposed ‘demons’ of the True Grimoire consist in reality of a wide range of spirit types,principally Elementals and Nature spirits. Nor do these in fact accord with the stereotyped picture of laterWestern magic, particularly in relation to Elementals. Their nature is far more in accord with the view ofthe late pagan philosophers, and their interpretation of the gods and spirits of the traditions with whichthey were in contact. Accordingly many of these spirits will be found to possess considerableintelligence. Some among them will enhance the spiritual, moral, ethical and even physical developmentof those who approach them. This is almost the precise reverse of some modern views of spirits, whichenvisage the magician binding a ‘demon’ in order to liberate some potential previously inhibited by it. Bycontrast, some of these spirits will often encourage personal transformations the magician is resistant toand cannot achieve unaided.In order to get the most out of this approach to magick the operator will need to be open to new ideas,though they are in fact extremely ancient in origin. In particular it must be realised that not all approachesto magick are compatible. Many modern Western systems have little in common with the approachinvolved here. While a Western Grimoire underlies the family of spirits described in this series, greatcare should be taken in adapting Grimoire materials for use with this approach.On the other hand, this tradition has much common ground with many traditions outside the Westernmilieu. As well as the Living Traditions mentioned earlier, materials from ancient Greek and Egyptiansources will be found to be particularly compatible. The relationship of these materials with the laterGrimoires provides useful indications on how to adapt the latter for use with these spirits. The empathythis magick has with the late period in ancient Egypt involves another significant advantage. This periodwas that of the emergence of Christianity in many forms, and of Gnosticism which in some of its formswas also Christian while including philosophical, magical and astrological ideas from various sources.This magick similarly can be embraced by modern Gnostics of whatever religion, so long as the Spiritistapproach is embraced in return."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Table of ContentsIntroductionThe Strong OneKlepothFurther ReadingAbout the Spirit Work Series"}]
