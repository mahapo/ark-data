Manyetymologies ascribe a Semitic origin to this name, finding its cognate in the name Yah or even in theTetragrammaton. Still others conjecture that the name has its origins in Jove, or perhaps Iacchus. Ourconcern here is not with word origins, however, but with the practical magical application of this elusiveformula. To that end, it will be helpful to conduct a brief survey of the usage of this word of power in thecontext of some modern magical systems. We will conclude by introducing the topic in the milieu of theOgdoadic Tradition, which places a unique emphasis on IAO, in addition to providing a brief introductionto the Ogdoadic mysteries as a whole.In the Golden Dawn system, IAO comes into play with the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram, andspecifically that section known as “the Analysis of the Keyword,” which is itself derived from theinitiation rite of the Adeptus Minor grade. The Keyword presented is INRI, a notarikon for the name andoffice of Christ, the god-form with whom the Rosicrucian adept identifies. This is deconstructed into itscorresponding Hebrew letters, yielding Yod-Nun-Resh-Yod, which relate to the Paths of the Tree andtheir equivalent symbols: Virgo, Scorpio, and Sol. These are then paralleled with the Egyptian god-formsof Isis the creator, Apophis the destroyer, and Osiris the redeemer, whose initials give us I.A.O. Hence,IAO in the Rosicrucian tradition is closely tied with the mysteries of death and rebirth, both of the Christ-Osiris figure as well as the initiate, firmly attributing a solar nature to its mysteries.Looking to Thelema we find these same solar themes in their use of IAO, although Crowley has madesome modifications. Crowley states that this is the principal formula of Osiris and, while characteristic ofthat Aeon, it has served different functions through all three Aeons of his system. In the Aeon of Isis, IAOrepresents the mysteries of the parthenogenesis and the birth of the Sun/Son. The Aeon of Osiris brings tothe formula the mysteries of departure from the Mother, and the hero’s death and redemption. For theAeon of Horus, Crowley modifies IAO to VIAOV: the addition of the two Vavs makes the gematricenumeration of his Hebrew transliteration total 93, and represents the inherent individuality of the Adeptfrom beginning to end – for through the process of death and rebirth he discovers his True Will and theStar that he has always been. Crowley alludes to another usage of IAO in Liber Samekh, calling it “theFormula of the Magick of the BEAST whereby he wrought many wonders.” For the purpose of this study,the important thing to note is that Crowley also acknowledges IAO as a formula of Tiphareth.The Ogdoadic Tradition is unique among modern esoteric systems by employing IAO as the DivineName (or Atziluthic formula) used for the lunar sephirah of Yesod. In the course of this guide we willexpound on this central notion and its rationale and implications, but for now it will serve to give a fewexplanatory remarks about the provenance and nature of the Ogdoadic Tradition itself.“Ogdoadic” means, simply, “related to the number eight.” This term in this context was coined bypractitioners of this system in order to provide a retrospective focus for their magical heritage. TheOgdoadic Tradition represents the magical theories and practices that were born from the fusion ofAlexandrian Hermeticism, Neoplatonic Theurgy, Gnosticism, and Hebrew Qabalah. Regarded by many"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"practitioners as having a more pagan “flavor” than, for example, the Rosicrucian Tradition and itsderivatives, the Ogdoadic Tradition was crystallized in its present form in the Order Aurum Solis. TheAurum Solis was first unveiled to the public in The Magical Philosophy series of books by MelitaDenning and Osborne Phillips, and while the Aurum Solis exists today under new leadership it has shiftedfocus from the original teachings recorded in The Magical Philosophy. The Ogdoadic system originallypresented by Denning and Phillips continues to be taught and manifested through the work of a succeedinggroup, the Ordo Astrum Sophiae. The present work is derived from the author’s personal experimentation,and serves as an example of how the Ogdoadic material can evolve and be developed in new andmeaningful ways, all in consonance with – indeed, built on the foundation of – the original Aurum Solisteachings.The reference to the number eight relates to what are termed the Mysteries of Regeneration, or“Palingenesis.” As many other mystery traditions over the ages have done, the Ogdoadic mysteriesrecount the story of the Sacrificed King – he who must seek his own death in order to attain New Life.The number eight has long been held to denote these regenerative qualities, evinced by its associationwith the Christian mysteries of baptism (derived from earlier Pagan sources), or the aural qualities of theoctave – the rebirth of a musical note on a higher level. Accordingly, the Ogdoadic Tradition takes as itsensign of attainment the eightfold octagram – and so does each initiate of that tradition strive toward thecontinued interaction between the worlds of spirit and matter, both in order to sublimate the lower in thehigher, and to bring the higher to manifestation within the lower worlds. The Ogdoadic mysteries alsoprovide for methods to reach that attainment – the attainment of Adepthood – which are based upon thestructure of the psyche itself. This methodology forms the backbone of the Tradition’s initiation cycle, butalso of each individual ritual technique – this is the Fivefold House of Sacrifice. In addition to theemphasis on these key structures of Eight and Five, the Ogdoadic Tradition has a number of otherdistinguishing features, including a “Constellation” of certain principle god-forms derived from theHermetic mysteries, and reliance on Ancient Greek as its sacred language.Though this study is concerned with one particular Greek name through the lens of the Ogdoadicpractitioner, it will still prove valuable to initiates and students of other traditions of the Magical Art forthe theory and ritual methods presented herein require no adherence to any given system. As such theymay be validly employed by all aspirants who find a fit with their current program of practice. Here, then,are true and never before published keys to the Mysteries of the Lunar Formula of IAO."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE ANGUISH OF ACHAMOTHAs has been mentioned, the Ogdoadic Tradition traces some of its heritage back to the various sects ofGnosticism. It is here we must first turn to in order to understand why IAO is considered a formula of theMoon-sphere.The Gnostic Valentinus taught of an intricate cosmology of Aeons, archetypal qualities in whichgodhead was reflected. These Aeons dwelt within the Pleroma, or “fullness” – the realm of utter divinity.For our purposes, the Pleroma may be considered equivalent with the Qabalistic world of Atziluth. Thelast of these Aeons in order of their creation was Sophia – “Wisdom.”Sophia desired to create a being as she had been created – but she manifested a daughter who wasforever outside of the Pleroma. This daughter of Sophia was known as Achamoth. Another Aeon withinthe Pleroma, Christos, took pity on the formless chaos that was Achamoth and gave form to her. Achamothnow yearned to gain entry into the Pleroma, but was restrained by the barrier known as Stauros, or“cross.”In her utter distress, Achamoth pressed herself against the barrier and uttered “IAO”[1] – and from heroverwhelming grief, anger, and fear, was born the physical universe. Here we see why IAO is considereda lunar formula: the letters have generative as well as deeply emotional connections. Generative as Yesod(and Yetzirah) are generative, birthing forth Malkuth (and Assiah) – and also as associated with the verylunar mysteries of motherhood. Yetzirah and the Nephesh are also the realms of emotion and instinct,which are likewise of the Moon."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CLAVIS LUNAEUnderstanding the myth that inspired the usage of IAO as a lunar formula, we may now proceed toelucidate some of the intricacies of this veritable Key to the Astral.A teaching persists in the Hermetic Qabalah that the 29th, 31st, and 32nd Paths of the Tree of Life – thePaths of Qoph, Shin, and Tau – form a “bow”, of which the Arrow is the 25th Path of Sagittarius, theArcher. The origin of this teaching, aside from the relationship between the Path of the Archer and theArrow, is that the Hebrew word formed by the letters associated with those three paths is QShTh (orQesheth), which means “bow.”This bow represents the aspiration of the initiate to Adepthood, by the arrow path of Samekh. Thus thebow of Qesheth also symbolizes the mastery of the initiate over the forces of the Astral World, for thewould-be Adept must indeed govern both the forces of his own Nephesh as well as become proficient inmanipulating the plasticity of the greater world of Yetzirah.By gematria, the Hebrew letters of Qesheth are numerically equivalent to 800, and 800 is also the valueof the letter Omega in isopsephy, the Greek form of gematria. The letter Omega itself is a great bow,ready to be aimed upwards just as the bow of Qesheth:One Greek word for “arrows” is ἰά. Capitalizing ἰά we easily arrive at a figure which very muchresembles an arrow:Taken in full, then, our assembly of bow + arrow = IAO. This important relationship to the bow ofQesheth, and the mastery of the Astral is echoed in the images of the lunar goddesses Diana, Artemis, andSelene, who were all huntresses to whom the bow and arrow was sacred.IAO then can be seen as a formula expressing this Yetziratic governance – the function of Yesod as theGate Sephirah of the world of Yetzirah – and yet simultaneously an aspiration to attain higher, just as IAOexpressed the yearning of Sophia-Achamoth to return to the Pleroma.We may turn to another venerable tradition of Hellenic and Alexandrian magic, the association of theseven Greek vowels with the seven classical planets, in order to further understand this arcanum. Omegais associated with Saturn, Iota with the Sun, and Alpha corresponds to the Moon. Here again is animportant connection with the Bow of Qesheth, for in that formula the letter Qoph corresponds to Pisces(ruled by the Moon), the letter Shin to Fire (but also of Spirit, both of which relate to the Sun), and theletter Tau to Saturn/Earth. Therefore the formula of IAO, though it is rooted in the Yesod of Yetzirah,expresses the dynamic movement between the levels of the psyche represented by the Qabalistic “Parts ofthe Soul” as they exist in the Four Worlds.At this point in discussing the Key we would do well to consider the ordering of the letters IAO. In thisfirst form of the Name we have, relying on the planetary correspondences above, Sol (I), Luna (A), and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Saturn (O). In other words, here we have a picture of the descent down the Middle Pillar – theinvolutionary manifestation of the Worlds, from Tiphareth-Sun (I), to Yesod-Moon (A), to Malkuth-Saturn/Earth (O). Note that here the Omega correlates not to Saturn as Binah, but to its lower octavewhich is the Lesser Mother – Malkuth – mirrored also in the “Saturnian gloom” of the 32nd Path. This isthe formula of IAO as Spear and Grail, as the following diagram depicts:In this formula of descent, Yesod of Yetzirah (the Alpha) is the fulcrum by which the Magician maybring his will into manifestation, and implant the Seed of that Will into the Lunar Womb.IAO is the divine name of Yesod in Atziluth, but is therefore particularly connected to and potentthroughout the Astral World of Yetzirah: the Iota can be seen as the Tiphareth of Yetzirah, the Alpha asthe Yesod of Yetzirah, and the Omega as the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Here we see that the impregnation ofthe Yesod of Yetzirah gives birth to the Malkuth of Yetzirah; and that which is wrought in the AstralMalkuth must inevitably find its manifestation in the Malkuth of Assiah.This impregnation, albeit at the supernal level, is a central mystery of the Wand/Spear and Grail ascelebrated within the Ogdoadic Tradition (viz., the ritual formula of “The Gnostic” in Denning andPhillips’ Mysteria Magica). This is the great alchemical coniunctio, and the perfect union ofMelanotheos and Leukothea, the Children of HA, who shall themselves sire forth the Agathodaimon.Thelemites will also find relevance with regard to Liber XV, wherein the name IAO is likewise adoredalongside the mysteries of Lance and Grail.The averse formula, OAI, is the expression of the mysteries of bow and arrow which we havedescribed. Whereas IAO is the descent through the sephiroth Tiphareth, Yesod, and Malkuth of the worldof Yetzirah, OAI represents the ascent through the worlds of Assiah, Yetzirah, and Briah all within thedomain of the sephirah Yesod. To put it another way, the domain of IAO is solely within the Astral – OAIascends through the Astral as an arrow shot heavenward.In OAI, the Omega – the bow – is Yesod of Assiah. Traditionally this is interpreted as the Moon asphysically manifested in Earth’s satellite and, as we shall see, the crescent of the moon itself is indeedour bow in this regard. Again, the Alpha is Yesod of Yetzirah – the silver-headed arrow by which wemay penetrate the Veil. Iota is Yesod of Briah, which may be interpreted as the higher aspects of “love,”ascribed at first by the Ruach in a confused manner to the as-yet-unknown contents of the Neshamah, butever more gradually unfolding as the true love of the Beloved."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"BOW AND ARROW, SPEAR AND GRAILThe Moon sphere both receives light and reflects it outwards. So too is the nature of IAO twofold: it issimultaneously a formula of ascending aspiration and a formula of descending inspiration. These twomodes correspond to her waxing and waning phases, and these are the pinions of Shukla-Paksha andKrishna-Paksha, which flank the lunar orb and give her the title “Winged Plenilune.”The formula of aspiration is that of Qesheth, the bow and arrow. Here the bow is the physical nature ofthe magician, which serves as a launching point into the higher and inner planes. This corresponds, then,to the waxing moon, and its growth towards fullness.The formula of inspiration is the impregnation of the grail by the spear. This is the waning of the moon,which is involutionary at its essence. Thus from the “fullness” (Pleroma), the decline into the world ofSaturnian matter is aptly figured by the seemingly impenetrable darkness of the womb. The cycle will becontinued once the “child” is born under the new moon.The implications of these formulae for the magician are vast. They may be employed simply tocelebrate the Lunar Mysterium in its own right, or they may form an important component the would-be-Adept’s quest to Know his Genius. They are eminently suited as an adjunct to workings of practicalmagic, or may assist the magician in a Promethean task of bringing God-fire back for the benefit of allmankind.The versatility of the formulae should foster experimentation, but the below rite is given as an exampleand has been found to be particularly effective in augmenting ongoing works of magic intended to producea physical effect. The complete working occupies one full lunar cycle, from Shukla-Paksha to Krishna-Paksha, but the mage may find it effective to persist in the daily performance for as long as is deemedfitting; to do so emphasizes a valuable link with the ebb and flow of the Aestus Lunae. Furtherconsiderations, such as the Mansions of the Moon, may be incorporated into this sequence to great effect.MYSTERIA ARCUS ET CALYCIS 1. Let the Votary of the Sun perform this work during one full cycle of the Moon. Thusshall he penetrate beyond the lunar veil and manifest the wonders of the WingedPlenilune.2. On each successive night of the waxing moon, he shall enter the Chamber of Art andlight a single violet lamp upon the Bomos[2].3. Let the Adept take up the Great Wand[3] and, raising it up vertically, let him rise onthe planes by vibration of the formula OAI: let the vibration of the Omega establishhim within Yesod of Assiah, the vibration of the Alpha initiating the ascent beyondinto Yesod of Yetzirah, and with the intonation of the Iota let him enter into theYesod of Briah[4]. He shall remain within the Briatic ambience of the moon-sphere foras long as he pleases.4. On the night of the full moon, let the Adept enter the Chamber of Art in darkness.5. He shall aspire earnestly to the Supernal Mother in what form he will."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6. His aspirations shall conclude in uplifting the Grail, and making offering of his ownbeing.7. On each successive night of the waning moon, let the Adept enter the Chamber of Artand light a single violet lamp upon the Bomos.8. He shall conjoin the Wand and Grail with intonation of the formula IAO: he shallvibrate the Iota as the Wand descends, the Alpha as the two are conjoined, and theOmega shall be intoned after the Wand is withdrawn.9. On the night of the new moon, let there be silence.THE KEY ANGELICALThe use of Enochian within the Ogdoadic system is the subject of a tremendous amount of research andongoing experimentation within the Ordo Astrum Sophiae – and specifically the House of Adocentyn –and will be explored in depth in a forthcoming work to be titled The Sword of the Sun. For our presentpurposes, one aspect of that study in particular is relevant as it pertains directly to the formula of IAO.Interpreted within this Ogdoadic redaction of the Angelical system, IAO is reflected upwards on theTree to the supernal sephiroth in the words: “Iadnah Ananael Oma” which translates from Enochian to“Knowledge, Wisdom, Understanding.” Here we see the Lunar arcanum of IAO, but now elevated beyondthe attainment of Tiphareth, which is shown forth in the Path of Gimel. Gimel, the High Priestess andCamel of the Moon, crosses the vast Abyss which “sunders noumena and phenomena,” and so journeysthrough the realm of Da’ath (Knowledge), and bringing the forces of Chokmah (Wisdom) and Binah(Understanding).Thus here is the formula of inspiration translated to a higher plane. Rather than the masculine forcedescending into the feminine, as Wand into Grail, here is the descent of the Higher Feminine force into thenow-receptive masculine, indicated by the arrow-head of Chokmah-Binah-Da’ath which pointsdownward along the Path of Gimel. This is the Intuitive Mind or Neshamah disclosing itself to the Ruachdirectly.Those wishing to explore this lofty concept, which is truly the domain of the Adeptus Plenus, mayreplace steps 5 and 6 of the rite previously given with the following:5. He shall utter the second Enochian Key and make invocation of PAOAOAN as follows:“Thus do I invoke you, PAOAOAN, whose garments of light are beautified with admiration, and whodwells within the radiance of the Eternal.”The arms are folded, left over right, across the chest.6. Then let him uplift the Grail and vibrate IADNAH – ANANAEL – OMA.PERORATIOWe have followed the arcing arrow-course to its height and the descent of the primal spear into thelunar womb, and throughout run the themes of ebb and flow, wax and wane: the tides of the self-renewingMoon. For she is both the Great Mother as well as her outer reflection, and that seed which she bears willever be born, and that which is born may be uplifted beyond her veil."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Something of this mystery can be found in the following Gnostic hymn which was to be spoken by thesoul of the deceased in order to escape the demiurge and his archons, and which may fittingly draw thiswork to a close.Ἐγὼ υἱὸς ἀπὸ πατρὸς, πατρὸς προόντος, υἱὸς δὲ ἐν τῷ παρόντι.
