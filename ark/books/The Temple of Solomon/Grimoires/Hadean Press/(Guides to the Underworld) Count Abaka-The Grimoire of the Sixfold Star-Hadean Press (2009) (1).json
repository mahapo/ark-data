[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Introduction This small book describes a method of invoking twenty two Genii of a combined Solar,Mercurial nature. This is a method derived from Thelemic sources and involves an English qaballistic system. This system is presented solely as a viable magical framework, rather than a 'secret key' to the Book of the Law (a premise described in The Magick of the Ghebers: The Equinox: BJoTVII.9). The first part of the book involves the relations between the Adorations from the Stele of Revealing and the Tarot in terms of ritual magick. Crowley's verse translation of the Adorations appears in Chapter III of The Book of the Law, the first 'verse', which appears in chapter one of AL is a separate matter from these, insofar as it is not a translation of the hieroglyphics but a description of the imagery of the stele. It is with the verse translation that we are concerned here. 1"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Adorations are analysed qaballistically, in terms of the Names of God and magical instructions both implicit and explicit in their structure and the context in which they appear in AL itself. On internal evidence the third chapter of AL has two parts, referred to Ra, Hoor,Khuit and Hoor,Paar,Kraat as twin gods. The subject matter of the one part is distinct from that of the second, although they have certain elements in common these arc presented from different angles. The Adorations introduce the second phase of the chapter, but let us remind ourselves just how this changeover is made, and how the Adorations arc introduced. 'The half of the word of Heru,ra,ha, called Hoor,pa,kraat and Ra,Hoor, Khut. Then said the prophet unto the God: I adore thee in the song-I am the Lord of Thebes, and I The inspired forth-speaker of Mentu; For me unveils the veiled sky The selfslain Ankh-afna-khonsu Whose words are truth. I invoke, I greet Thy presence, 0 Ra-Hoor Khuit! Unity uttermost showed! I adore the might of Thy breath, Supreme and terrible God, Who makest the gods and death To tremble before Thee:-I, I adore thee! Appear on the throne of Ra! Open the ways of the Khu! Lighten the ways of the Ka! The ways of the Khabs run through To stir me or stiU me! Aum! Let it filL me! So that thy light is in me; & its red flan1e is as a sword in my hand to push thy order. There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters, (these are the adorations as thou hast written), as it is said: 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The light is mine; its rays consume Me: I have made a secret door Into the house of Ra and Tum, Of Khephra and of Ahathoor. I am thy Theban, 0 Mentu, The prophet Ankh-afna-khonsu! By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star-splendour, 0 Nuit!

What is more, the second, third and fourth lines of the verse following this peculiar interruption of the Adorations each have twenty-two letters. These are the three lines which name the four gods (of the solar quarters) and refer to the secret door mentioned in the prose interruption. l\\1 F II A V E M A D E ,\\ r. C R E '!' D 0 0 R N T 0 '!'

Elsuna 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"These are the natnes of twenty two spirits of Mercury and the Sun. They have a hierarchical pattern that has similarities to Tarot but with some differences related to its use among them. No relation to old correspondences or Hebrew letters is implied, this is simply the pattern they employ to define their roles. Note first seven spirits corresponding to the traditional planets, under the rule of Khephra which are to be invoked at Midnight. Note also how Fortuna, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form a class outside the imtncdiate rule of the Four Sun Gods. Note also that Ahathoor has dotninion over eight spirits, which may be invoked at Midday. Two of these (associated with Sagittarius and Capricorn, with their special relationship with the Libra�Scorpio complex) are also under Ra, and may alternatively be invoked at Dawn under His presidency, while the last three spirits are under Turn as well as Ahathoor, and may be invoked at Sunset under His auspices. The attributions of the last six spirits are complex and mysterious, however the main attribution to the reflected 'Chaldean Order' of the planets is more than sufficient for most purposes. The last four letters of the English Qaballistic Alphabet arc not covered by this attribution, they represent the four elements composing 'The Universe', attributed to X.

The methods of calling them also involve these things, for instance writing of talismans and magic squares, spoken invocations, ritual in general, gazing at grids of letters, making of sigils. These things please then1, and so other offerings are not generally necessary. When they have responded to a request a ritual should be performed, or a letter grid etc. made as an offering or for communing with them. The type of ritual, ritual aids including grids, squares and sigil methods, the various ways of timing rituals and other aspects of working with these spirits follow later. Sigils of the Rulers The Sigils of Ra, Tum, Khephra and Ahathoor may easily be derived from this magical arrangement of Their Names. R T K H H A M p A H u E A T 0 H R A 0 R These three Names of God: Heru�Ra�Ha, Hoor�Pa�Kraat and Ra�Hoor� Khut �can also be found in this arrangement and their sigils derived. Sigils of Thoth, Maat and Hathor are also to be found herein, and naturally Hoor and Heru as these Names form parts of the other Names. The sigil of Khephra is to be used in Rituals of Midnight, when invoking the Genii corresponding to the traditional seven planets. Similarly the sigils of Ra and Tum, and that of Ahathoor arc for usc when invoking spirits under their presidency at the Solar Stations. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"On Timing I twill be noted by traditionally minded students that if the seven 'planetary' spirits are to be invoked at Midnight, then some method of planetary days and hours could be implied for those particular spirits. Planetary days and hours have a long history, but have no obvious connection with astrological timing or planetary cycles. However, neither do these Genii, they are simply classified under planetary headings for convenience. It is the four quarters of the day that empower them, and they can be accessed through the adorations frotn Liber Res h. The Genii of Mercury have their place in this schema, since Tahuti is invoked along with Ra�Hoor at each such quarter, and Tahuti may be said to correspond with the Mind of the magician as Ra�Hoor to the Will. It is perhaps these weapons in the magicians armoury, affirmed at these points of the Sun's apparent circuit of the heavens, which give the Genii their power. Other Times These spirits may be invoked at aspects of Sun and Mercury, especially the conjunction of the two, of which there are six in every year; forming a hexagram in the heavens. Also at aspects of Fortuna and the Part of the Daimon with the Sun and Mercury. Ritual Material These spirits arc essentially Thelemic in nature, since they arc connected to magical imagery once associated with Egyptian solar cults and now incorporated into some of the rituals of The lema that involve Sun and/ or Mercury in Egyptian guise. The subrituals of Opening and Closing of the Pyramid are good 'temple' rituals for them. One of the best possible conjurations is that called Liber Israfd or Majesty of Godhead, which is a powerful invocation of Thoth, (this is available fairly widely, but see also Crowley's description of this ritual and it's performance in The Formula of the Elemental Weapons: Magick Book 2, Chapter II.) after which the magician is so identified with the god almost all they need do is merely name any spirit of a harmonious nature for it to appear. The thirty lines of the Adoration in Chapter III are converted into a barbarous invocation (the climactic spell following lsrafel etc.) by taking the 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"number of letters in each line and converting the numbers into syllables with the Wakanaba technique: XU BA MO LAZE TI WAOL EL QE XU EL TI MOMOXU EL WAAL QE UL PI TI ILGUNATIXU These are then formulated into the spell below: XUBAMO LAZE�TI WAOL ELQEXUEL, TIMOMOXUEL, PETI LAOL XU LAZE, WAAL QEULfl,TI, ILGUNATIXU: (N#) [#N represents the nan1e of the particular Genii invoked.] The appropriate spirits tnay also be invoked after performance of the Solar adorations at the appropriate tilne of day, with such other ritual as the magician selects, for example the Adorations from the Stele of Revealing. Note also that the Opening of the Pyramid includes a brief adoration of Tahuti/Thoth that builds an itnage of the god up very quickly: 0 thou the Apex of the Plane With Ibis Head and Phoenix Wand And Wings of Night whose serpents strain Their bodies, bounding the beyond Thou in the Light and in the Night Art One above their moving might! 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Obtaining Sigils for the Spirits When drawing sigils for these spirits the Square of Mercury or the Sun will prove perfectly adequate, however equally 'traditional' geometric Sigils of the Twenty Two Spirits may alternatively be obtained frotn the grid of eighty squares lettered as follows: A K u E 0 y I s B L v F p z J T c M w G Q A K u D N X H R B L v E 0 y I s c M w F p z J T D N X G Q A K u E 0 y H R B L v F p z I s c M w G Q A J T D N X H R B The manner of doing this is to take the six,lettcrcd name of the spirit and divide it into three two letter syllables. The alphabet is repeated on the grid three tin1es, with two letters over, the first two letters of the name are taken fron1 the first complete alphabet on the left hand side of the grid, so that the sigil begins at the first letter, and a line from it to the position of the second letter completes the first syllable; the next two letters arc found in the second complete alphabet, and the third two letter pair in the third alphabet on the right hand side. The exception to this is when the operation is performed at dawn, invoking the spirits under Ra, then the A in the first syllable is taken from the letters left over (AB) in the bottom right hand corner. Tracing a line fron1 the first letter through letters 2 to 6 forms the essential shape of the sigil, which is completed by embellishing the sigil with a circle at the beginning and a wedge or short line at the end of the sigil. For mnemonic reasons, connected to the form of the grid, these sigils arc called 'The Sigils of AL,Kabala'. The grid itself may be painted as a 'tablet' with the letters in the appropriate squares. It should not be used until thoroughly consecrated , the preferred 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"method includes placing the tablet on the central altar and on six consecutive days invoking over it. After this the Tablet can be used in rituals of this system; for example, tracing the appropriate Sigil of AL,Kabala over the Tablet at the climax of the Invocation of Tahuti. A chant or chants may easily be derived from this grid when extended with Wakanaba techniques. Such chants arc very appropriate to operations where the void state is desired, or in operations of Tahuti (Eight is the number of Mercury, and this grid concerns both letters and Qaballa, themes particularly attributed to Mercury). An example chant with suggested pronunciation guide is given below: AL,KABALA CEMODINA ELOLFIPE GUQE HORI AL,Kabbalah Cairmodeenah Airlolfipay Gukay Hoori ILSU,JUTI ULELVQ,fl WAGUXUHO YQ,JL,ZEJU EelstHluty Ulclvo,fee Wahguzoohoh Yoh,eel Zairdue AL,KABALA CEMODINA OLYQ,PEZE QE,AL RIBA AL,Kabbalah Cairmodeenah Olyo,Pairzay Kay,AL,Reebah SUCE,TJ,OI ULELVQ,fl WAGUXUHO Sookay,Tee,Oee Yule,clvo,fee Wah,goo zoohoh ILSU,JUTI KAUL,LAVO MOWANAXU OLYQ,PEZE QE,AL,RIBA. Eelsu duty Cahul,Lahvo Mowahnahzoo Olyo,Pairzay Kay AL Rceba. Such chants are useful when evoking the Mercurial Spirits, and may be combined with the 'Majesty of Godhead' Invocation found in Liber Israfel (the original invocation, composed by Allan Bennett, which forms the main text of Liber lsrafel begins '0 thou Majesty of Godhead' and ends 'Every Spell and Scourge of God may be obedient unto me' the rest of the text may be omitted and replaced as appropriate to the ritual in hand) . Alternatively, or in addition, a ritualtnay be composed involving the Adorations from Liber Resh, those from the Stele of Revealing and the 'Xubamo' Spell which was given earlier. Liber LXV begins with a splendid invocation of use in Midnight operations, while Chapter V (attributed to Mercury) of Liber VII could also be appropriately 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"employed with this system, and there is a splendid rhymed invocation of Thoth in the Opening of Liber Pyramidos; possibly the First and Second Keys of Dec's Enochian schema might have their place among these rituals. A major ritual, even so far as evocation to visible appearance, may readily be developed from these tnaterials; always bearing in n1ind that ritual is meant to be a vehicle for effective techniques. Such operations can certainly be sophisticated and arduous, but comparison with the Golden Dawn methods (see the Invocation of Tapthartharath in Crowley's Equinox 1.3.) has consistently shown them to be both less tin1e consuming and more effective. Oidiho He is the mentation of the moon, its higher thinking and ideals. He helps acquire the vibration of the moon and the understanding of its processes. He Jmrifies the aura so it may accept the light of the moon. He has a strong link to prophecy. He first appeared as a large spider and then took on the shaJJe of a man in a asana. His head went from his chest to his back as he spoke. Soon after working with Didiho (within two weeks) I see in my journal that I had several dreams that led to me creating my glyJJh magic method as well as a few other dreams of either speaking with the divine or ascension into higher spheres.
