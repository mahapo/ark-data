The first part of the spirit's natnc cotnes frotn ancient roots tneaning 'elevated, exalted, high, praised'. It can be seen in the Greek Eleleu, 'praised' whence co1nes Eleleus, a title of Bacchus (the praised). The equivalent Hebrew root gives us 'Hallelujah': 'God be praised'. It can be seen also in Helel, a Hebrew title of Venus as Morning Star, which is to say Lucifer. An in1portant spirit in several Gritnoires is 'Gaap', also called Gap, Goap and even Tap. In sotne classifications Gaap is one of the Elernental Kings, in others he is the 'guide [the word used can also tnean the leader] of the four principal kings, as tnighty as Bileth'. While Bileth is counted the first and greatest King atnong 72 princes of detnons in these sources, he is also the first tninister of the King of Water in 'The Sworn Book of Honourius the Magician'. The Four Eletnental Kings were not included arnong the 7 2, who indeed answer to thern. This pennits an interpretation of Bileth as a secondary King of Water, to whotn Gaap is equal or equivalent. Although references to these Kings are extretnely cornplex and tnuddled in the late Gritnoires, enough is known to identify Oaap as a King of Water. It is likely too that he is descended frorn the Egyptian god Hapi, also called Hep or Hap. Hap was the God of the Nile and an extretnely popular god cunong Egyptians of all classes with n1any household shrines. He was worshipped at N ilopolis, and also at the shrines which tnarked the boating stages, about a hundred in nurnber. The Nile represented also the Celestial Waters or World Ocean in which all existence is afloat, and upon which the stability of all things depends. His narne also resetnbles the Egyptian Qebh, 'cool and refreshing water', which is also a title of the rejuvenated tnagician. Frorn this it is possible to translate Elelogap as: 'the Higher Waters', 'Praise be King of the Waters' or 'Praise the Cool Refreshing Water', or perhaps tnost sin1ply: 'Holy Water'. Hep or Hapi is always represented as a tnan, but his breasts are those of a woman, indicating the god's powers of fertility and nourishrnent. The two kingdon1s of Egypt, North and South, each had a fonn of Hapi, that of the South being Hap� Reset, and of the North Hap�Meht. It is a possibility that the androgynous irnage of Baphotnet was partly inspired by Hapi of the North. Hapi of the North also appears in the splendid Zodiac of the Ptoletnaic ternple at Denderah, bearing two vases, representing the Zodiacal Sign of Aquarius. 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Further discussion of the origins and tneaning of the natne will be found later in this booklet. Properly understood, Elelogap is oncofthe n1ost itnportant and hard working of all the spirits of the True Grimoire. He is easily overlooked by those whose interest in these spirits is superficial or itnage conscious (who usually start with Claunech in search of wealth, or seek Lucifuge Rofocale via the Grand Grimoire). This approach generally ends in tears, appropriately enough considering Elelogap 'governs matters connected with water', as the Gritnoire sotnewhat succinctly puts it. Though the Gritnoire apparently passes swiftly over Elelogap, 'a second glance' is n1ore than hinted at in the hierarchical details. Whereas rnost of the so,called subordinate spirits arc under one of the two deputies of a Chief, Elelogap is the only one under two deputies who are responsible to two different Chiefs. These are Agliarept, deputy of Lucifer, and Tarihimal (Tarchirnache) deputy of Belzebuth. So let's take a second glance, beginning with a look at the power accredited to the spirit, who 'governs n1atters concerned with water'. Many such tnatters arise in the full titne, hands on tnagic of the old sources: rainwater, seawater, water from a river, a lake, a stre<=nn or a spring; water collected frotn particular places, or in particular ways, and tnost definitely for particular purposes. In addition, water has an itnportant role in religious rites, and in rnagical and religious costnologies. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE NATURE AND WORKINGS OF ELELOGAP There is a traditional classification of spirits, developed in ancient tirnes and refonnulated in the Middle Ages, that is very much suited to the spirits of the True Grimoire. This is the classification by Elernents. The tnost fatniliar fonn of this is the late rnedieval reforrnulation by Agrippa and others. In their thinking the Elernentals were cornparatively lowly creatures dwelling in the sublunary region (beneath the Moon). In this systetn Spirits of Fire are referred to as Salarnanders, those of Air as Sylphs, of Water as Undines, and those of the Earth as Gnomes. Collectively all are referred to as Elernentals. In tnore ancient tin1es the Elemental classification was quite different in rnany irnportant respects; it extended to entities that others rnight refer to as gods and angels. So for ex<nnple, the Spirits of Fire were formed from the fire of the starry region in which they principally dwelt. Similarly the other Elernental spirits were seen as rnore exalted in nature, and this status has never entirely departed in magic or folklore, despite the classification systems in vogue at any given tilne. As you rnay have guessed, Elelogap is no Salamander, but an Undine, and a very powerful and important one. For a practical n1agician alliance with such a Governor is of enormous advantage, and their relationship will be important and ongoing. Their alliance will assist a great rnany types of magic, not to rnention alchemy, and many aspects of ritual, besides more 'routine' magical activities frotn purification baths to the rnaking of inks. Working with Elclogap involves any rnagical work concerning water whatsoever. The idea is to adapt your magical work so in future, whenever you take a ritual bath or use water in any occult fashion, Elelogap will be actively assisting you. The precise details of this work will depend on various factors in your life and tnagical work. Spirit work is ongoing, like any other relationship, and as water forms a large part of much tnagical work Elelogap will be a spirit you work with regularly. In this way he is one of the best spirits to learn frotn concerning relationships with spirits, with a cotnplernentary effect on relationships with people. This is in accord with the astrological connection of water with the etnotional reahn. So besides enhancing the effectiveness of 'routine' magical work, working with Elelogap will also have a positive effect on your etnotionallife. The sitnplest way to begin this work is by drinking water. This is sornething many Westerners do not do enough of anyway, with consequences for their 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"health and well being they disregard at their peril. It is not surprisi ng then to realise that in addition to developtnent of the en1otional nan1re, work with Elelogap is also helpful regarding health. This is obvious enough, since water is one of the essentials of life. Also, the sitnplest herbal rernedies involve water: herbal teas, infusions and decoctions. In tenns of spirit work these herbal preparations concern both Elelogap and the herbal spirit Heratnael. Working with both these spirits is an extretnely powerful cotnbination that will advance the tnagician 's work by leaps and bounds. For now however, let us focus on Elclogap. Methods A silnple drink of pure water is a powerful aid in working with Elelogap. This can be as sitnple or as con1plex as desired or appropriate. In the sitnplest form, ask the spirit to itnbue the water with reviving potency, and express the desire to know thern better through drinking it. In rnore con1plex tonns, ritually prepare the vessel and water, and involve drinking or otherwise using the water in a ritual where Elelogap is invoked. If you find working with Elelogap increases your desire for water, you are likely getting a response. It tnay be the spirit has decided to help you improve your health, or is rnerely letting you know they are listening. Whenever you use or work with water in any aspect of rnagical work, ask Elelogap for assistance either with a sitnple address, or a conjuration. C)ften enough it is appropriate to specify the kind of help needed, 'in this work of purification', or 'in cleaning these vessels of tnagic art' and so on. This should not be said harshly, and need not be extrernely fonnal either. Speak clearly and honestly, as to a trusted person close to you. Another straightforward aspect of work with Elelogap involves cleanliness, whether as an aspect of ritual or of daily life. Ritual baths are cotntnonly encountered in Grimoires and other traditions. Sitnilarly, traditions such as Voodoo involve a large variety of special tnagical 'washes' for ritual iterns, for the body, doorsteps, hornes and workplaces, and tnore besides. Usually successful practitioners of these traditions keep a very clean house, in a very positive and indeed spiritual sense. Work with Elelogap shows the tnagician very clearly why this is so. The assistance of the spirit rnay well include powerful urges in the sarne direction. You might be very well groorned, and have no special interest in enhancing your bath tirne experience further. Having begun work 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"with Elelogap, however, it should not corne as a surprise if you find yourself suddenly adopting a new routine involving cleaning sornething or other, and feeling happier when it is done. Initially though, use of a ritual bath, with an address to Elelogap included in its preparation, is a useful way of bringing the spirit into your life and n1agical work. This can be done by itself, simply to work with Elelogap, or prior to any tnagical work of whatever nature. ()ne irnportant and useful technique for ongoing work with the spirit is obtaining water for n1agical use. To illustrate let us begin with rainwater. Depending where you live this task rnight be a regular part of your n1agical routine, or an occasional one. In an area where rain is infrequent the significance of the task, and the tnagical value of the water, will gain in in1portance. The sarne factors detennining this will also influence your choice of equiprnent. All such equiptnent, understand, is for rnagical use only, whatever it consists of. Preferably it should be new, and obtained for the purpose. It should also be purified and consecrated before you put it to work. This will also involve either a dedication to Elelogap, or alternatively an invocation for assistance frorn the spirit. One approach is to assernble a dedicated collection of bowls of appropriate size, ready for instant deployrnent. Also required is a sieve, to be lined with clean rnuslin or other cloth for filtering, and an ernpty bowl to receive sieved water. In addition you will require containers for storage, preferably fairly large. While containers with a cap and tap are useful, it is also desirable to have at least one container with a cover that can be rernoved. This perrnits ready access for a variety of purposes, such as the addition of herbs, or use of a ladle (another watery instrun1ent rnentioned in the Grirnoire). It also pennits you to see the water and have a rnore personal and aesthetic relationship with your water spirit assistant. Now by this point the rnore nervous arnong you n1ight be wondering: 'is this work with Elelogap going to turn rne into an over ernotional hygiene freak?' to which the sitnple answer is no. What we have been discussing is something that is generally otnitted by supposed manuals on the conjuration of spirits. While these appear to tell you how to get in touch with spirits, they often do not tell you how the spirit rnight get in touch with you. Although working closely with Elelogap is generally beneficial as outlined, the power of the spirit is not to be underestirnated. Like water his power 'seeps' 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"into rnany areas of tnagical work, and of your life. Such wide�ranging assistance deserves recognition and repaytnent, as well as being a source of satisfaction. Part of the repayrnent naturally cotnes in respect for and tnaintenance of the equiptnent. This pleases the spirit, who naturally feels sorne attaclunent to these things, and is happy that you take care of thern. There rnay be other offerings, which will becorne clear in the course of working with the spirit. In rny own work with Elelogap these have never been of a sinister nature, let alone a request for rne to hand over my inunortal soul in return for services rendered. It is sitnply that the personal nature of relationships with spirits can take tnany forms. Usually one can learn a lot frorn the occasions when a spirit asks for sotnething to be done on their behalf. This is all part of the 'chetnistry' of the relationship, and is generally to be welcon1ed . Bear in rnind however that water is powerful for good or ill, it can destroy as well as give life. In traditional Astrology the ruler of Eletnental Water is the planet Mars, ruler of Scorpio and named after the God of War. Given this, it is not surp rising that there are aspects to working with water that are not necessarily cornpletely benign, if at all. This is possibly reflected in the fact that Elelogap has tl.vo superiors, indicating a cornplex nature and wide powers. TYPES OF MAGICAL WATER There is a cmnplcx underlying sytnbolistn to a great tnany tnagical uses of water. ()riginating in late Egyptian tirnes and echoed in the tnagic of the Gritnoires and of folklore is sotne such rule as this frorn the Magical Papyri (PGM IV. 154�285): 'Rainwater if you are caHing upon heavenly gods, seawater if gods of the earth. river water if Osiris or Sarapis. springwater if the dead'. Despite the over sirnplification of this classification it is a very useful one for beginning our investigation of water in tnagic. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rainwater Rainwater is associated with 'Heaven' or Celestial gods, and its uses reflect this association. A\" Water fnnn Heaven it is an ideal basis for Holy Water, as its Celestial origin adds to the protective and life giving power of the water. It is saturated with the electnH.lyn an1ic solar energy by which it is dr awn into the air. It is also particularly good for healing purposes, containing 309{> rnore oxygen than tap,water and 100% n1ore nitrogen. This underlines the ancient associations of rainwater with Light, and the ethereal elernents of Fire and Air. It is very significant that between the upper regions of Fire and Air, and the lower realtn of Earth, rain is intermediate. The Greek physician Hippocrates called it 'Sunwater'. He was a strong advocate of its internal and external use, together with fruit juices which are sirnilarly endowed with oxygenated, solar energised water. A glass of pure rainwater is mnong the rnost suitable offerings for rnany of the spirits involved in rnagic, of whatever nature. ()fferings are a fonn of cornmunication, and Elelogap's assistance is naturally helpful in assisting rapport via water. This particular offering is often rnade to spirits whose nature is not in itself necessarily of Water, and even spirits whose nature is not 'Heavenly'. This is not really surprising, as the nature of spirits is cornplex, as is the nature of rnagical work. There are powerful reasons, which the true rnagician cornes to understand in tiinc, why Heavenly water is frequently offered to the darker spirits. Working with Elelogap is a potent assistance in obtaining understanding of all these rnatters. Spring Water While the significance of rainwater is profound, other types of water are significant in different ways. Sorne associations of spring water are subtler in nature than with rainwater. In the Magical Papyri and the Grirnoires, and also in folklore and rnythology, water frorn a spring frequently concerns the Underworld. This association is probably rnore widespread in other traditions than rnay appear at first glance. The Underworld association obviously holds true whenever used in rituals involving ancestral spirits. In various traditions also advanced ancestral spirits and the gods are frequently associated with one another. A great rnany gods and spirits have also possessed Underworld roles, even though in son1e cases these rnay have been forgotten. In these and other 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ways the 'Underworld' associations of spring water are found throughout the rnagic, religion and folklore of the West, and far beyond. 1-Iowever, water can represent a gate between worlds as well as the Underworld, and spring water frequently equates with one or both of these rneanings. Spring water is also often very pure (where circurnstances pennit it nowadays), and rnay contain health giving rnincral deposits. It is perhaps as intirnately associated with Life and with the Earth as with the Underworld. For all these reasons spring water can have sirnilar status to that given rainwater above. It is frequently used in offe rings of water, and in Holy Water, but also in necrotnantic operations. River Water In the sorcery of the Magical Papyri water frorn a river involved great and powerful gods like ()siris and Serapis, who although benign in nature were nevertheless chief gods of the Egyptian Underworld. Sitnilarly there were four great rivers of the Underworld in Greek rnythology. One is the river Phlegethon, whose waters were on fire. Another is the river Cocytus, the weeping river with unwholesotne waters, frotn this river Alecto, one of the Furies, takes her title Cocytia virgo. Most have heard of the river Styx, associated with the infernal deities Hades, Charon and Cerberus, on the waters of which the Gods thernselves swore inviolate oaths. Of equal farne perhaps is the river Acheron, whose forernost earthly counterpart was close to the earthly equivalent of the Cocytus. There was an Egyptian lake of sirnilar nmne, Acherusia, near the city of Mernphis. ()ver this lake bodies of the dead were conveyed; it is thought the Greeks acquired their ideas of Charon the ferrytnan of Hades frorn thence. Through water frotn rivers and lakes used in tnagical operations, Elelogap can assist you in contacting this region, its rulers and its inhabitants. Seawater 193. So therefore first the Priest who governeth the works of Fire, rnust sprinkle with the Water of the loud,resounding Sea. Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster. For work with Gods of the Earth, rneaning the terrestrial and natural world in general, seawater was considered best by the authors of the Magical Papyri. 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Arnong traditional instructions specifically involving Elelogap are instructions on making artificial seawater where access to the sea is not available. This basically involves salting the water, literally 'rnarinating' it, which tneans 'to n1ake like the sea'. This water was used in weather rnagic, for rain or snow, of which neither is salty. Behind this idea lays seawater's connection with the Earth and Nature gods in the older sources. The principal deities of the pritnordial ()cean were the oldest of the gods in Greek and Egyptian cosrnology. That sea deities were also the parents of river deities and lesser water spirits in Greek n1ythology is also helpful in understanding this idea. Sirnilarly a good deal of rainwater originates in the sea prior to evaporation and condensation in the attnosphere, so this idea involves a cotnbination of scientific understanding and sytnpathetic tnagic. Despite this however real or artificial seawater has no rnonopoly in weather tnagic. Water frotn springs, stremns, wells and rivers has often been used for rain�rnaking. There is another iinportant aspect to the syrnbolisrn of seawater in Egypt. Just as Osiris is associated with the Nile, so Set his rival and rnurderer is associated with the sea. As Plutarch tells us: 'what is said by the Pythagoreans, that the sea is the tears of Kronos, appears to riddle the fact that it is neither pure nor of one nature in itself... the tnore wise of the priests call not only the Nile ()siris, and the sea Typhon; they call every source and power that moistens Osiris, considering hirn cause of generation and essence of seed, and Typhon everything hot and fiery, and of a drying nature generally and one hostile to tnoisture'. Another aspect of work with seawater in ancient sources involves working with the Goddess Venus or Aphrodite. In this case it is not the water, but the foatn specifically that is collected, and used with other ingredients in preparing spells invoking her aid. It will not escape the notice of the observant reader that rnany fonns of 'Holy Water' involve salt. By contrast, scnne fo rn1s of spirit work take care to avoid salt except in purification of the parclunent in advance, or in exorcisrn. When working with the dead, or with underworld or infernal spirits, salt and saltwater is only used for the two purposes rnentioned. In such workings, should relations with these spirits rernain arnicable, they will never encounter salt in your presence. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Other Types of Water The types of water used in rnagical rites and divinations are extretnclyvaried. Resides the above there are references to water collected frotn a shipwreck, to dew collected frotn plants, to water frorn a well, to dirty water frorn the street and other places. All these types of water have syrnbolic tneanings, son1e obscure, son1e sitnple. MAGICAL OPERATIONS INVOLVING WATER In the True Grirnoire the two rnost protninent instnunents involving water are the vessel for water, often called an asperser, and the water sprinkler or aspergillus. The asperser is to be rnade or consecrated on the day and in the hour of Mercury, when the Moon is crescent (which tneans waxing after New Moon). Make it big so it tnay hold sufficient water. It rnay be tnade of brass or earthenware, or cast in lead. The forn1s range frotn a large goblet to a sitnple pot perhaps with a lip for pouring, or a flat bottotned ladle. In the case of lead it should be varnished within and without. In addition you could engrave or paint your choice frorn these inscriptions upon it: 1. COPH-NIA + FALUTLI + AORMUZDI + NU-HAD 2. COPH-NIA + FALUTLI + AORMUZDI + BABALON 3. BABALON 4. COPH-NIA + FALUTLI + AORMUZDI + NU-HAD, and BABALON separately. If desired add appropriate sigils, etc. The sprinkler or aspergillus is rnade frotn sprigs of tnint, rnarjoran1 and rosetnary, which were all used in ancient Greek rituals of purification. Each of these herbs has a wealth of itnportant associations, detailed in the Book of Herarnael, the spirit of Magical Herbs. Naturally if you are growing thetn yourself, watering thern will be part of your work with Elelogap as well as HerarnaeL These herbs are bound by a thread, traditionally rnade by a virgin tnaiden. Alternatively new white cord that has been specially obtained, prepared and consecrated n1ay be used. A good alternative is to obtain special cord, for cxatnple a cord used in religious ceremonies. Another is to obtain a cross or 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"other holy syrnbol hung on a cord, and reuse the cord. The sprigs rnay then either be sirnply tied together or to a wooden handle tnarked with appropriate narnes or sigils, as desired. This sprinkler is to be nwde in the day and hour of Mercury, the Moon crescent, as before, indeed the asperser and sprinkler rnay be rnade (or consecrated) at the satne tirne. Fill the asperser with water <�nd bless it as follows: 'I bless and sanctify this water in the names of Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit! Amen.' Then charge the water as follows: 'In the names COPH-NIA, FALUTLI, AORMUZDI, NUHAD (&/or BABALON), and the potent chiefs Agliarept and Tarihimal, I ask thee ELELOGAP to impart purifying power to this water in the rites of Magick.' Sprinkle this blessed water on the asperser and sprinkler saying: 'In the Names of Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Amen'. When this is cornpletcd say: 'Arise, 0 ye creature of the (name any item, in this case the asperser and sprinkler) into initiation of thy pure virtues and service to those operations concerning spirits.' Then consecrate the asperser and sprinkler with blessed incense. For this you need a censer with lighted charcoal. On this you place arornatics (preferably a mixture of aloes wood, frankincense and tnacc), blessing then1 with the following words: 'Fiery spirit Haristum and thou wise Heramael, bless the creature of this perfume, that it be a remedy for the human race, and a remedy for our souls and bodies! That all creatures breathing this fragrance have wealth of their bodies and souls: By the Power of the Lord of the Aeons! Amen.' and while perfurning then1, say the following: 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"'0 Mighty Spirits, be our help, and may our work be accomplished by you. NUIT, ABRAHADABRA, TITAN, 10-PAN: Great Daimons; and do thou also, 0 wise and fJowerful spirits Heramael and Haristum, come and give to this a virtue so that this creature may gain a shape, and by this let our work be accomplished.

The Orison of the Instrument 'I conjure thee, o fo rm of the Instrument, by the authority of the Lord of the Aeon by the virtues of Heatt'en and by all the Stars that rule; by the virtue of the Daimons; and the virtue of the Elements; by the virtue of stones and herbs; and of snow storms, winds and thunder: that thou now obtain all the necessary power into thyself fo r the JJerfect achievement of all our desires! In the Names of the Creator of the Sun and the Daimons! Amen.' Then read over the Asperser and Sprinkler the Chapter of Water (III) and the Chapter of Spirit (V) from The Book of the Heart girt with a Serpent. And afterwards say: 'OMENTU, QADOSH-ISIS, COPH-NIA, NUIT, JESUS, HERU, ASAR-ISA, AIWASS, ANKH, BAPHOMET: Most Pure Daimons, be the guardians of these instruments, they are needed fo r many things.' These rites are used in purification and consecration rituals for all of the instrurnents in the True Grilnoire. Elelogap, with the spirits Haristun1 and Herarnael, is involved in all such rituals perforrr1ed by those who work with thern. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Magical Bath Ritual baths prior to ritual work are a staple part of rnany traditions, be it the Orirnoires, Voodoo or the tetnple rituals of Greece and Egypt. Such baths are often comtnenced with a prayer, and in the Grirnoires this is frequently cotnposed around the subject of water in Biblical passages. An alternative prayer, in use by modern Gnostics, follows below. It is derived frotn 'The Book of the Heart girt with a Serpent', a Holy Book of tnodern n1agicians. The Orison of the Ablution Bless and charge the water as described above and then in place of the ()rison of the lnstrurnent recite the Orison of the Bath, which is found in the next section following.

Employing the Magic of Water for Gnosis and Illumination An ancient tnethod of obtaining prophetical power or illurnination consisted of visiting a sacred spring, fountain or other water source, invoking the spirit presiding over it, and drinking the water. The rnagician and the spirit were united through the rnediurn of the water, and ilhnnination fo llowed. When this rnethod is ernployed for conununion with Elelogap, it rnay be done with rainwater. When ernploying it at a water source, Elelogap tnay be invoked 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"for conununion, or as part of the conjuration of the resident spirit. Another, rather different approach, requires sotne introduction. An author in Rornan tirnes, Lucius Apuleius, wrote a celebrated work entitled The Golden Ass, which while cornic in nature has a serious side. Apuleius was accused of rnagic, and was certainly very knowledgeable on the subject, as well as having sotne involvetnent with the Mysteries of Isis. His book describes the adventures of a rnan turned into an ass by a witch. Eventually the ass finds the road to deliverance via an itnprovised cererr1ony. As well as a rnental prayer to Isis at a special tirne, this ritual involved standing in the sea and dipping his head below the water no less than seven tiines. By tneans of this 'baptistn' and prayer he obtained a vision of Isis - one of the greatest descriptions of a deity in Classical literature - who told hitn how he may regain his hutnan fonn and change his life. There are of course parallels in other religions: one thinks of John the Baptist, and the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove upon the baptised Christ. There is very powerful tnagic involved in this procedure, which can be adapted for obtaining exalted states of consciousness, through the cornbination of the shock of the irnn1ersion and the exaltation obtained in invocation. A large bowl, into which you can lower your head, or fron1 which cupped hands can take water for dousing the head, can take the place of the sea (or the River Jordan). Besides this the only essentials are a suitable ritual preparation beforehand, and an invocation rnade itntnediately after the 'water shock' has been adtninistered. This powerful n1agical process can be applied in various ways, whether as a purification rite in the course of a larger ritual, or an ecstatic cletnent of an invocation. It is very potent and useful in both these rol es, and in rituals of illurnination and initiation generally. It is obviously best to be wearing sirnple, unrestr ictive clothes when perforn1ing such a rite, or even naked. The nutnber of 'itnmersions' varies, once, three titnes or seven times have all been etnployed at one tirne or other. In the Opening of the PyTamid (part of Liber Pyramidos a splendid ritual con1posed by Aleister Crowley) a single 'itntnersion', or rather dousing, is used. Interestingly enough, as in the Golden Ass, the Goddess Isis is one of the deities invoked in this ritual. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"OF WATER ELEMENTALS IN GENERAL 77. There are certain Water Eletnentals whon1 C)rpheus calls Nereides, dwelling in the tnore elevated exhalations of Water, such as appear in datnp, cloudy Air, whose bodies are sotnetitnes seen (as Zoroaster taught) by rnore acute eyes, especially in Persia and Africa. Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster 'Hear rne to the end and know that the seas and rivers arc inhabited as well as the air. The ancient Sages called this race of people Undincs or Nytnphs. There are very few tnales an1ong thetn but a great nurnber of fen1ales; their beauty is extreme, and the daughters of tnen are not to be cotnpared with then1.' [Cotnte de Gabalis. Discourse II.] In Hispanic folklore there are spirits natned 'water rnaidens'. These are fetnale spirits of sn1all size, each having a star in their forehead, a shitntnering straw coloured body and flowing golden hair. In addition they wear white rings on their right hands, and a gold band with black stripes on their left wrists. Yellow flowers spring from their footsteps, which rnay be carried as a good luck charn1 by those who find thetn. These spirits are typical Undines or water spirits in benevolent guise, who are an1ong the fo llowers of Elelogap. The Undines of n1odern occultistn are identical with the water Nymphs of ancient lore. There were two rnain classes of Nyrnphs, those of the land and those of the sea, although - if you will forgive the expression - this division is far frorn water,tight. The sea Nytnphs were called by various collective nan1es and were associated with rivers, strean1s, pools, lakes and fo untains as well as the sea. These Nymphs were fen1ale deities of the ancients, though tnost were not accorded the smne status as the Olytnpians and other superior deities. They had few tetnples, one being the Nyn1phaeurn at Rotne, adorned with their statues, and with refreshing fountains and waterfalls, offering an agreeable coolness. As offerings they received tnilk, honey and oil, as well as the occasional sacrifice of a goat. They arc generally represented as beautiful tnaidens, veiled up to the rniddle. Sotnetitnes they hold a vase, fron1 which they seen1 to pour water. At other titnes they hold grass, leaves and shells. It was considered unfortunate to see then1 naked, the result being deliriurn. They often dwelt in the sea, or upon rocks and rnountains, or in woods and caverns. Besides these places grottoes were their frequent habitation, decorated 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"with evergreens �nd delightful scenes. Although their tctnples were fairly rare, dedicated grottoes were tnore con1mon; typically a natural cave with or beside a water source was the basis of these shrines. An itnportant class were the Nereides. In theory they were sea nytnphs of the Mediterranean, particularly the Aegean. The Naiades were nytnphs of fresh water and the ()ceanides of the great oceans; particularly the Atlantic which was often called ()ceanus or Ocean. In practice the title Nereides cu11e to refer to tnany other nyrnphs, both of fresh and salt water. Their father was the Sea God Nereus, represented as an old tnan with a long flowing beard and hair the colour of the azure sky reflected in the Aegean Sea. ()ther representations show hin1 with all his facial hair fonned fron1 sca�weed. He was a powerfully oracular god, whose prophecies were often sought, though on occasion he used his shape changing powers to escape overzealous questioners. This shape changing power is typical of water spirits and is still called 'Protean', after Proteus another sea god with prophetic and shape changing powers.

Their cult is evidently far older than the later (Jlyrnpian state religions. The tern1 Nereides carne to be used in texts such as the Chaldean ()racles as a general tenn for water spirits, such changes in usage arc probably partly responsible for the great nurnber natned in ancient sources. The n1ythology of ancient Greece includes many natnes of Nyrnphs, which are given below. The early Christians asstnned the Nyrnphs to be den1ons. It is certainly curious how the lists of their narnes rescn1ble catalogues of den1onic natnes in the Gritnoires. Even rnorc curious is the fact that the Satyrs, tnasculine nature spirits who rnorc closely resernblc later 'devils', seetn to have no recorded names. Knowledge of the narnes of spirits is important and useful to the tnagician. In the case of the natnes of the Nyrnphs they are useful in appreciating the status and itnportance of the Water Elernentals to our ancestors.

These texts were contetnporary with the Magical Papyri, and are strongly associated with thern; an Eighth Book of Moses is indeed nurnbered an1ong thern. The texts Zositnus describes included details such as the use of seven 'hydria' (brazen water vessels) to bind forty�nine spirits, which is ren1iniscent of tnuch later Goetic tradition, while reflecting a stronger astrological base. Explicit references to these sarne Solotnonic books - the irnn1ediate ancestors of the Grin1oires- appear in the Gnostic scriptures. ()ne of these Gnostic holy books, On the Origin of the World, accordingly rnentions the very same vessels and spirits. In the closely related book, The Hypostasis of the Archons, appears a Great Angel Heleleth (also translated Eleleth), whose narne derives frotn the satne root as Elelogap.

The possibility of a connection with the Four Elernental Kings of the later Grirnoires is underlined by the extensive role of Eleleth in Gnostic rnythology at precisely the points where it overlaps with tnagical handbooks of the time. Returning to ()ceanus, besides the Oceanides, he was father by Tethys of the deities of n1any principal rivers, such as Achelous, Alpheus, Peneus and Strymon.

She shared the divine honours of her husband, and was the rnother of Triton. A colossal statue of this sea�goddess can be found at the entrance of the Villa Albani, near Rc)lne. This statue probably resen1bles that at the tetnple of Neptune in ancient Corinth. Triton- son of Poseidon and Amphitrite - was extrernely powerful atnong the sea deities, with the power to raise or caltn stonns at his pleasure. He was represented blowing a trutnpet fonned fron1 a conch shell, his body above the waist that of a n1an, below the waist a dolphin. S01netin1es he is shown with the forelegs of a horse. Many sea deities are called Tritons, but only those who are half hurnan and half fish should receive the natne. Triton was also the narne of a river of Africa, falling into lake Tritonis; besides this lake was a ternple of Athene, frorn which she took Tritonis as one of her titles. Triton is also an ancient n1ythological title of the Nile. This is itnportant rnagically, considering the connection of the Nile god with Elelogap. lrnages of a Greek or other sea god would be suitable on an altar as an itnage of Elelogap. linages of Hap or Triton would be doubly appropriate. The name of Triton however would also be a particularly suitable invoking nam.e in rituals. It is a particularly resonant nan1e since it also suggests the Trident of power. In allied traditions the trident's three points represent past, present and future. This sytnbolisrn connects with the oracular powers of sea gods such as Nereus, and with the .Hydron1antic divinatory arts. Reference has been rnade to King Nurna in connection with Hydrornancy already. He was instructed in the religious rites to be introduced in Ron1e by the goddess Egeria.

Orphic Hymn to Proteus (Accotnpanied by an incense offering of Storax.) Proteus I call, whom Fate decrees, to keep The keys which lock the chambers of the deep; First-born, by whose illustrious power alone All Nature's principles are clearly shown: Matter to change with various forms is thine, Matter unformed, capacious, and divine.

Come, blessed father, to our rites attend, And grant our happy lives a prosp'rous end. The Muses, of whon1 several have the sarne natnes as Nereides and Oceanides, are clearly related to the Nytnphs. Their offerings were of water or n1ilk, and honey, and their favourite haunts included the Castalian spring and the founta ins of Aganippe and Hippocrene. Erato's connection with mitnicry suggests the protean qualities of the water deities. The Naiades who, more properly than the Nereides, represent the nyn1phs of fresh water, were held in great veneration by the ancients. Many statues once thought to be of Venus are now taken to represent these Nytnphs. They are represented as young, beautiful tnaidens, often leaning upon an urn, frmn which flows a strean1. At their ceretnonies sacrifices of goats and lambs were offered to them, and libations of tnilk, honey and oil. Individual worshippers also offered tnilk, fruit and flowers. Modern rnagicians working frotn these traditions should avoid pouring tnilk, honey or oil into water, let them instead tnake these offerings beside the water, or at an appropriate shrine. Many of 24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"these nytnphs presided over sacred springs which could inspire those who drank frorn thern. The nyrnphs thernselves were seen as possessing prophetic power, and able to inspire tnortals. Anyone in a state of rapture - seers, prophets, poets and tnadn1en - could be described as caught by the Nyrnphs. A final note on offerings, according to sorne wine was specifically excluded frorn offerings to Nyrnphs, but others include it without explanation. This is a subject for tneclitation, divination in advance, and cautious experirnent. Given the changeable nature of water, wine rnay be the cause of unwanted behaviour in water spirits. Alternatively this very factor tnay occasionally be useful as an ex citant in smne operations involving Nyrnphs. The Prayer of the Undines, Hymns and Invocations The Elernental Prayers are fairly well known to modern occultists frotn two sources. Primarily perhaps these prayers are known frorn their use in the Elernental Grades of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn in their turn obtained thern frorn the n1agical writings of the famed French rnagician Eliphas Levi. Their history before that is a little obscure, although the text of the Prayer of the Salarnanders is given in the Cornte de Gabalis. There it is credited to the (_} racle of Delphi, apparently quoted by Porphry. Further research is required to verify this origin, and perhaps trace the others. More irnportantly, the ideas underlying the use of these prayers are rnuch rnore certain. They are not typical conjurations, which are often though not invariably coercive in nature. On the contrary, these are prayers the Eletnentals are said to have cornposed thernselves. They represent their own devotions to, and their own understanding of, the Suprerne Deity. When the n1agician recites then1 the idea is to etnpathise with the higher religious feelings of the spirits concerned, and thus attract thetn to you. This is a rnatter of attuning oneself to the spirits, encouraging them to trust and work with you, rather than of cotnpulsion. The conception of God in each case is frorn the perspective of the elernent concerned. In Qaballistic tenns the idea of God is that of the Creator of the Four Elernents (often called F.l.A.T. frorn Latin initials of the Elements) analysed into four subsid iary natures. These are sirnilar to the Elernental Kings thernselves, though on a rnuch greater scale. The sentilnents of the prayers are thoroughly Gnostic in tone, the concepts of sin and salvation being intirnately connected to the goals of personal liberation and attainment. 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Prayer of the Undines Dread King of the Sea, who hast the Keys of the floodgates of Heaven and who enclosest the subterranean Waters in the cavernous hollows of Earth; King of the Deluge and of the Rains of Spring; Thou who openest the sources of Rivers and of Fountains; Thou who connnandest tnoisture, which is like the blood of the earth, to becorne the sap of plants: We adore thee and we invoke thee!

Unlike the Grirnoires thernselves, the type of rnagic encouraged here is unasharnedly anirnist, in conunon with rnodern African traditions and those of rnixed African, Arnerindian and European origin in the Arnericas. The view of the spirits is generally respectful, and the cc)lnpany of son1e of thern is distinctly encouraged and wclcorned. The existence of difficult, 'hard' or even hostile spirits is recognised; but others have sin1ply been unjustly dernonised. The Gritnoire, while rnasking itself as a handbook for controlling the fonner, is in reality far broader in its scope and involves both, as did it's ancient predecessors prior to the detnonisation of n1agic and the entities with which it deals. The supposed 'dernons' of the True Grimoire consist in reality of a wide range of spirit types, principally Eletnentals and Nature spirits. Nor do these in fact accord with the stereotyped picture of later Western rnagic, particularly in relation to Elernentals. Their nature is far rnore in accord with the view of the late pagan philosophers, an d their interpretation of the gods and spirits of the traditions with which they were in contact. Accordingly many of these spirits will be found to possess considerable intelligence. Sorne atnong thern will enhance the spiritual, rnoral, ethical and even physical development of those who approach thenL This is almost the precise reverse of son1e n1odern views of spirits, that envisage the rnagician binding a 'dernon' in order to liberate sorne potential previously inhibited by it. By contrast, sorne of these spirits will often encourage personal transfonnations the tnagician is resistant to and cannot achieve unaided. In order to get the n1ost out of this approach to rnagick the operator will need to he open to new ideas, though they are in fact extrernely ancient in origin. In particular it nn1st be realised that not all approaches to rnagick are cornpat.ible. Many modern Western systerns have little in cornn1on with the approach involved here. While a Western Grirnoire underlies the farnily of spirits described in this series, great care should be taken in adapting Grirnoire rnaterials for use with this approach. ()n the other hand, this tradition has rnuch cornrnon ground with n1any traditions outside the Western rnilieu. As well as the Living Traditions n1entioned earlier, rnaterials frorn ancient Greek and Egyptian sources will be found to be particularly cornpatible. The relationship of these rnaterials with the later Grimoires provides useful indications on how to adapt the latter for use with these spirits. The ernpathy this rnagick has with the late period in ancient Egypt is significant; this period was that of the ernergence of Christianity in rnany fo rrns, and of Gnosticistn which in sc)lne of its forrns was also Christian while including philosophical, tnagical and astrological ideas frorn various sources. This rnagick sirnilarly can he embraced by rnodern Gnostics of whatever religion, so long as the Anirnist approach is ernbraced in return. 28"}]
