A woRD ABouT WHAT GoETTA rs Nor. Many people withsome acquaintance with occult literature will associate goetia with thefirst book of the Lemegeton, the Goetia ojf Solomon the King; whichdeservedly or not is nowadays perhaps the most famous of the grimoires.Indeed, in Aleister Crowley's Book IV, aII the refercnces to goetia involvethis grimoire and nothing else. However, this first book of the Lemegetonoriginates in mid-seventeenth century England, whereas the term goetiais ancient Greek, so clearly there is some distance between the date of thegrimoire and the origins of goetia.This significant distance is unconsidered in popular usage, and evenamong many modern authors. It is not uncommon to hear such expres-sions as goetic demons or even goetias when referringto the spirits of thisgrimoire; which could be acceptable were it applied equally to demonsof other grimoires, which it is not. This restricted usage is inaccurate inother ways and one in particular is of interest here. In English, the wordmagician derives from magic, the person taking their name from their art.Two other words used for magician in Greek follow similar lines, phar-makos refers to the use of drugs, and epodo.s to the use of chants; onlyma7os does not follow this rule, and that is a loan word from Persian,its relationship to magic being possibly perceived rather than actual. Bycontrast, the term goetia derives from a word indicating a person, a rarecase of the art taking its name from the artist. Such a person was termeda goes. Goetia is related primarily to the identity of the operator, and onlysecondarily to their art or perceptions of it. Additionally the evocation of'evil spiritsi while relevant to the original context of goetia, and central to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"its later significance, does not define the operator's principal role or theoriginal purpose of their activities.The word goes reIarcs to terms describing the act of lamenting at funeralrites; the mournful howling considered as a magical voice. These magicaltones can guide the deceased to the underworld, and raise the dead. Thisis the root of the long connection of goetia with necromancy, which hascome to be termed black magic.Authors from Cornelius Agrippa to Mathers and Waite use the termgoetic of most of the grimoires, particularly the darker ones. The recenrfame of the Goetia of Solomon has obscured the long association of theterm with supposed black magic generally,From Agrippa the negative associations of the word goetia go back be-yond the medieval period into Classical andquity. Therefore, it might ap-pear feasible that goetia is a very old word for black magic. However, inGreek use magic was a term derived from a Persian root, whereas goetiaoriginates within the Greek language. In the history of Western magic,not only did goetia come first, it possessed a character that distinguishedit from many later forms. In its original form, goeria did not involve thesame worldview or assumptions as later magic of the approved Judao-Christian type. The circumstances in which it competed unsuccessfullyfor a time are no longer applicable, and the old assumprions increasinglyquestioned. Unfortunately, since magic is a specialized,largely amateurpursuit in the West, the old cultural assumptions linger in many forms,with an occasional nod in the direction of the new.Before postmodernism, the differences between goeria and mainstreamWestern magic involved certain cultural assumptions about what con-stitutes Western civiLization and what constitutes primitive' religion;including those ideas inherited by nineteenth century occultists. Thesenotions have impeded clarity in the Western tradition of magic. In or-der to express this more clearLy some of the old assumptions regardingWesternism require deconstruction, or at least to be identified. Therewere two main strands to the late modern view of Western civilizationrtheJudzo-Christian on the one hand and the Classical or Neo-Classicalon the other; each with their subdivisions, alliances and differences. This"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"bipolar superstructure while overly simplistic is nevertheless useful inunderstanding Western magic. Of course, in reality Northern Europeancultures played alarge role in the evolution of Western civilization, magicincluded, but so long as we recognize it as a generalization, this idea hassome use even now. It is in this sense then that my direction in writingis more towards a deconstructed Classicism than a deconstruction ofJudao - Christian tradition.The over emphasis on the Judao-Christian elements in the grimoireshas long obscured the immense contribution of the Graco-Roman orHellenistic world to Western magic. AncientJewish and Christian tradi-tions were but parts of this world. In this deconstruction of the old viewof the Classical world, its importance to Western magic as a whole is re-evaluated, not only in the past but also in the immediate present and intothe future. To avoid misunderstanding, this is not a strictly academic ap'proach, though availing itself of modern studies. The study of interpreta-tions of history is termed historiography, and I avail myself of this term toindicate that interpretation to a defrnite end rather than strictly scientificuse of literary and other evidence is the purpose here. Besides literary andarcheological evidence, I also employ real geographical, ethnological andmigratory foci. This is in order to deconstruct the old assumptions re-garding the superioriry of Greek over Pelasgian and other cultures whichare equally a pafi of the Greek legacy. By means of this apparatus, I hopeto elucidate and reinterpret Western magic and its relation to the widerworld, both ancient and postmodern.This approach serves a dual purpose, underlining the aspects of thislore most relevant to goetic magic, not only historically but also in con-temporary practice. This, rather than a straightforward srudy of Greekreligion, is the intent throughout. To accomplish this requires an inter-pretative method which necessarily differs in purpose and practice fromimpartial academic and archaeological evaluation of evidence. Traditionalmethods of philosophical speculation employed Greek myth as emblemsof moral or cosmological truths; the approach here both follows and de-parts from this precedent. As will be further elucidated in our discussionof myth, the aspects of myth and history emphasized differ, as does the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIApractical purpose served. This purpose is neither impartial historical un'derstanding nor a re-enactment style historical reconstruction nor evenHellenic neo-paganism. It serves an emergenr synrhesis of global magicproduced by cultural forces active in our own rime, in which Westernmagic is fused with influences from the New World and elsewhere. TheseAfro-Hispanic infuences, essendally spiritist in narure, have strongaffi,ni-ties with earlier phases of Western magic. In order to facilitate the fusionto maximum effect, these earlier phases and their contributions ro mod-ern magic require elucidation.The last great synthesis of magic occurred in the Hellenistic world;formulated in the great schools of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, andincorporating astrology and the Graco -Egyptian roots of alchemy. Majorfactors in these fusions were the older traditions of Chaldean star-loreand Greek goetia. Although modern occultists often imagine the roots oftheir tradition lie in the Kabbalah, this is in fact a medieval system thatdid not enter Western magic until the Renaissance: with Mirandola andAgrippa in the r49os. Even then, Kabbalah, and in parricular those parrsof Kabbalah incorporated in modern magic, involve a good deal of earlierHellenistic origin.The Spheres of the Primum Mobile, frxed srars, the seven planets andthe Earth were integral parts of the Neoplatonisr asrronomical model.Thus, the order of the planets corresponding to the sefirot of the Tree ofLife essentially originates in Neoplatonism and Ptolemaic astrology. Theconnection of these categories with letters, names and numbers by mod-ern ritual magicians, whether they follow Agrippa or the Golden Dawn,also derives directly from Neoplatonist pagan magicians. Nor is this asuperficial resemblance; Neoplatonism is - after all - the origin of theLogos doctrine fundamental to Christian theology, and the deity withoutattributes central to that of the Kabbalists.For the first time since the Hellenistic era, a new global magical synrhe-sis has the potential to emerge. Given cultural conditions in the West andelsewhere, this potential will be realised. What needs to be asked is, whatpart will Western traditions play in it, and what aspecrs of Western magicare most compatible with New World and other magical traditionsi In"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"order to answer these questions it is imporranr to bear in mind that theGreeks were in prolonged conracr with both African and Indian tradi-tions, making Western avery ambivalent expression. Given the globalisa-tion of modern culture and the importance of Afro-Hispanic traditionsfrom the New World in modern magic, looking beyond the recent em-phasis on Kabbalah in Western ceremonial magic is necessary to achievea workable synthesis.It is my contention that goetic magic, properly undersrood, is the mosrimportant fundamental element Western magic has to contribute to themelting pot, being mosr comparible with magicalpracrices from the othercultures concerned. In order for this to take place, a major reappraisal ofgoetic magic is necessary.In the academic world, this has aLready occurredinlargeparr, but it remains necessary among Western magicians and theircontacts in the other traditions. Naturally, despite the usefulness of aca-demic studies, the requirements for this are rather different. It is to thesedifferent requirements rhar my study is geared, and while this requiressaying, it does not require an apology.Cbthonia LostMany authors have expended considerable energy distinguishing magicfrom religion, without much effect.In reality, magical. rites ofren includeremnants of religious traditions older than those currently in favour. Asrecollection of the original context recedes such survivals are either deval-ued and demonised or heavily disguised and redefined. Negative percep-tions then replace the former presrige and power of the older tradition.Even after deconsrructing unsympathetic interpretations, our perceptionscan never be those of the original participants in these traditions in theirvarious historical phases over many years. Therefore, while deconstruct-ing an outworn historical view of mph is rhe method, the intent is amythic view of history.Franz Cumont's book Chaldean Magic speaks of Persian magic enteringGreek use around the time of the Persian Wars. He says that a Book of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Ostanes: was the origin of the magic substituted from tbat time fortb for thecoafse and ancient rites of Goetia. As can be seen from accounts of themin Herodotus, the rites of the Magi known to the Greeks seem in themain to have been pre-Zoroastrian, and no less coarse and ancient inmany respects. More recent studies suggest that far from being replacedwhat we know as goeria took its historical form around this time, princi-pally through the new movement known as Orphism. This was, as will beshown, a reform of more ancient chthonic elements in Greek religion, in-corporaring eastern ideas. Despite occasional use of the term magos theseeastern infuences were not Zoroastrian; they originated chiefly in Crete,Asia Minor and Chaldea, while at the same time Orphism retained muchthat was innately Greek.In other words, this was actually more of a transfusion than a rePlace-menr; and in many ways revit alizedand transformed ancient chthonic tra-ditions; as Orphism actively concerned itself with Thracian and Pelasgiantraditions, while inrroducing Eastern elements at the same time. The BookoJ Ostanes does not represent an entirely new curfent, In history, but notits preceding myth, goetia began rather than died out with the advent andevolution of these Magian rites. Many feamres of old Greek rituals un-derwent a rnajor rransformation around this time, as religion transformedfrom family and tribalcults to city cults; and it is precisely then that goetiaaPPears.In the past, understanding this transformation was comPlicated by a cu-rious phenomenon in the history of magic, its foreign-ness whether acrualor supposed. Goetia was foreign to the Greeks in several ways, in mythicrerms it was associated with Dionysus in whom foreign-ness or outsiderstatus was an intrinsic principle. This quality of the god was furthet tein'forced by association with survivals of Pelasgian traditions and the cultsof foreign deities such as Cybele. These were all essentially chthonic innature. Outsider status is extremely frequently associated with demonicfigures in religion, and it is remarkable that despite these associationsDionysus retained and even enhanced his divine status.The chthonic realm was essentially coexistent with the celestial worldin Greek religion; it only became demonised after the rise of more exclu-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"sive ouranian or celestial emphases in later religions. However, the differ-ence in perspecrive and emphasis, and the association with foreign andlower class practices, contributed to making the goetic rites and traditionsincreasingly repugnanr ro the urban lirerati. This prejudice significanrlyassisted further subsequent demonisarion, but at that time goetia wasneither legislated against nor persecuted. It was an accepred part of theculture, that happened to be unpopular with intellectuals. The old ideathat the chthonic and celestial emphases in Greek religion were the prod-ucts of different cultures is fawed. In fact many of the chthonic deitiesand rites of Greek religion are evety bit as Indo-European as the sky-god Zeus; additionally such a dualism already existed in Mesopotamianand Hittite cultures. The two worlds co-existed in perfect balance withinGreek religion for thousands of years. The demonisation of the chthonichas compantlely little to do with matters of ethniciry; on the contraryforeign-ness is simply a common attribute of the demonic. Nevertheless,fertile ground for this demonisation was presenr in the Classical andHellenistic eras, and indeed long before.The dangerous nature of many chthonic figures is essential to recognise,although at the same time other roles are also proper to rhem. Hades,Persephone, Demerer and Hecate, along with Hermes Chthonios are sig-nificant figures in such traditions. Hecate is often associated with the neg-ative stereotype of witchcraft, but also had very benign roles that precededthese associations. Demeter, along with Persephone and Hades (and hisalter ego Plutos) were the pre-eminent deities of the Eleusian Mysteries;her cult began in prehistoric times. While associated with earthly fertilityand with the Underworld, the constellation Vrgo has long been associ-ated with her; her narure is both celestial and chthonic. While Hades asKing of the Underworld was at best an ambivalent character, his alter egoPlutos was rhe god of wealth through the fruits of the earrh. Attemptsto distinguish the rwo are erroneous. Earthly fertility was also the spe-cial province of Demeter and Persephone, with which they were as muchconcerned as with death. Alongside the enactment of Demeter's searchfor Persephone after her abduction by Hades there appears to have ex-isted another yet more mysrerious rire, the fruitful marriage of plutosvll"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and Persephone. On the other hand, the dead were termed children ofDemeter, or Demetrians. More sinister deities and entities, dangerous, re-quiring placating, were also strongly associated with the chthonic realm.These too had some positive roles, even if dependent on their dangerousnature; the Erinyes for example presided over oaths, with the clear impli-cation of punishment for perjury. They avenged wrongdoing and, whileterrible, their actions upheld what Greek culture considered right con-duct. There are in fact few figures in Greek myth, if any, that are whollyevil in nature.There were nevertheless major differences in the cults of deities of theOlympian or celestial realm and those of the chthonic region. Celestialdeities are invoked in daylight, in a state of purity and cleanliness, of-ten wearing white; the occasion is joyful, the altar is raised up, and thesacrificial victim looks towards the heavens at the moment of sacrifice.The dead on the other hand were honoured with lamentations, from theGreek word for which the term goetia has its origin. These ceremonieswere generally nocturnal, as were the Hittite equivalents. The garmentsof the mourners were torn and defiled with dirt, their hair hung loosezrnd in disarray. No altar was erected for the dead, rarher a pit was dug,into which the sacrificial beast looked down. Many features of the cult ofthe dead were shared with chthonic deities and heroes. Some distinctionsdrawn between the rites o[ the rwo worlds in the pasc are noc as bindingas had been supposed; some sanctuaries and rites included elements andfeatures associated with both chthonic and celestial entities.The history of Greek religion is long and complex; its beginnings pre-date Homer by a far greater period than that from Homer to our owntimes. It is not the purpose of this work to give an account of this his-tory, but its antiquity is important to bear in mind, as most of us areonly familiar with the Classical period in some basic form. The originsof the Greek cults are to be found in the Neolithic period, from whichoriginace substantial connections with the pre-literate cult iconographyof Catal Huyuk. The Minoan and Mycenaean periods followed in theBronze Age. After the destruction of these aristocratic cultures and theirpalace cults was a four hundred year Dark Age. This perrnitted a revival ofvlll"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"older Neolithic forms that had survived among rhe lower classes. Towardsthe end of this Dark Age, as well as during it, these were cross-fertilisedwith Middle Eastern infuences from r2oo BCE to 6oo. This infuenceoriginated in what is now modern Turkey and Northern Syria and wasparticularly strong in Cyprus, from which it was diffused to the largerGreek world. From the z6'L dynasty around 66o ecn Greek mercenariesserved the Pharaoh, and influence from Egypt increased accordingly. Theorigins of much of Greek ritual and myth in the religions of the Hittitesare importanr, bur beyond the scope of a study tracing Greek influenceon Western magic. The emphases for this study are the influences fromPhrygia and the European near equivalent in Thrace; also consid ered arcChaldean ideas - often confused with Zoroastrian ideas in anriquity -such as Zurvanism and its forebears.Chtbonia RegainedNotwithstanding the complexity of the relations between celestial andchthonic religion, the goetic strand within wesrern magic essentially rep-resents survivals of more primal elements within host traditions of an-other character. For example, magical approaches adapted and systemisedby the Neoplatonisrs. Invariably such brief atrempts as have been madeto define goetia are from the viewpoint of such host traditions or fromviewpoints hostile to magic in general, rather than the viewpoint of goetiaitself, It is difficult to speak of goetia in its own rerms when compecingwith the accumulated assumprions of so many intervening centuries. Forthe last two thousand years, our civilisation has lived with the assump-tions inherent in Revealed Religion. The civilisations of Classical Greece,and all other civilisations of the ancient world, were either built or su-perimposed upon a tradirion of thousands of years of what is known asNatural Religion. Whereas Revealed Religion is delivered from on highby a revelation - frequently represenred by a Book - Natural Religion isbuilt up from below; the result of observation of and interaction with thevisible world, including perceived supernatural or numinous forces. At theheart of these two approaches to religion are rwo enrirely different worlds."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"These two worlds, the centres of two opposed worldviews, can be termedthe celestial and chthonic worlds. These are not the limits of the world-views concerned, but their centres. That is to say, while Revealed Religionhas as its base the celestial or even super-celestial realm, it does not ex-clude considerations of other regions, such as Earth, Hell and the physi-cal universe in general. Similarly, while natural religion has the Earth andthe Underworld at its heart, this does not prevent it dealing with gods ofthunder or the Sun and Moon.In the same way, the source of the revelation of revealed religion is celes-tial, and this is the centre of its worldview. By contrast, the chthonic realmwas rhe source of oracular power at all stages of Greek religion. The celes-tial or transcendental realms became all important in later magic, not leastas the source of the magicians authority. Previously the earth as source oflife and the underworld as the abode of the dead were central to religionand magic. More to the point, much of the magic of later times - Particu-larly that characterised as goetic - was an adaptation - one mighr even saya disrortion - of the older type. Nevertheless, the initiai transition fromchthonic to celestial bases for magical authority did not involve a majorchange of character or content,The roots of the word goetia exemplify its chthonic connections.Whereas goetia is commonly translated howling, following the precedentof nineteenth century authorities which are too often unquestioned, acloser translation would be wailing or lamenting. There is a large grouPof related words in Greek, the majority of which refer specifrcally to an-cient funeral rites. The tone of voice used in these rituals distinguished thepractitioner of goetia, and the concern with the Underworld was equallyexplicit.The precursors and the earliest manifestation of goetia are principallyconcerned with the dead. At the same time, despite some parallels andlater syncretism, it has little intrinsic connection with the aristocraticOlympian religion of Homer.Its primary role was benign in that it serveda role in the community; that of ensuring the deceased received the Properrites to ensure they left the living alone. Alongside this were additionalroles. These included laying ghosts, including those where proper burial"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"had not been possible. Such restless spirits were troublesome, even hostileand dangerous. Their existence was a major reason for the practice of fu-neral rites in the first place.Another aspect of goetias involvement with the dead was necromancy.This, the art of divination by the dead, correlates naturally with the abil-ity to guide the dead to the Underworld. Those who could guide souls tothe Underworld could bring them back, at least temporarily.In its originalreligious context, necromancy was not perceived as anti-social, and somemajor necromantic oracular centres existed throughout the Greek world.The most sinister aspect of this involvement with the dead was theability to summon such spirits for purposes other than divination. Likenecromantic divination, this is a natural consequence of che role of guideof souls. However, it also relates very closely to the ability to deal withhostile ghosts of various kinds. The arts of exorcism and evocation areintimately related. It is from this aspect of its past that goetia is associ-ated with demonic evocation. Distinctions between underworld demonsand the angry dead have always been vague. Additionally, expertise in ritesconcerning the dead necessarily involves the gods and guardians of theUnderworld. Consequendy, in various guises, raising spirits has been as-sociated with goetia for much of its history,The impression caused by the confusion between the Goetia of Solomonand goetia itself is that goetia concerns evocation alone. There is a stere-otyped image of the conjurer calling up spirits into a triangle from withina circle, and bidding them to perform this, that and the other thing. Thisseemingly reduces all goetic operations to the same format, which is notthe case at all. Even disregarding the religious and funerary aspects, goe-tia involves magical methods of every variety.It is true that goetic magicinvolves the participation of spirits in virtually all its operations, but theseoperations are varied.The Grimorium Wrum makes clear that all operations are performedwith the assistance of spirits, but its methods include what we would callspells, and also methods of divination. Most often in these operations thesigils of appropriate spirits are involved in the procedure. There is for in-stance a traditional method of causing harm to an enemy through their"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAfootprint. In its Wrurn form this involves tracingthe sigils of spirits andstabbing a coffin nail into the print. Some of this methodology is reminis-cent of modern applications of Austin Spare's sigils, although rather moreresuits oriented than the uses the artist himself employed. Incidentally,my speculation inTbe True Grimoire that Spare was acquainted with, andinspired by its contents has been verified by Gavin Semple, (see his intro-duction to Spare's Two Tracts on Cartomancy).In general, Verunt employs full-scale evocation for one main purpose,which is to form a pact with the spirit or spirits concerned, precisely sothey wi[ be willing to assist the magician in other rypes of operation. Isay spirits in the plural for a reason.In contrast to the methodology of theGoetia of Solomon as popularly understood, Wrunr's process envisages thepossibility of summoning more than one spirit at a time for the purposeof forming pacts. While any evocatory process is demanding, in terms oftime and efforr expended, this multiple evocation process is considerablymore econornical, and far more productive. Modern understanding envis-ages the conjuring of a single spirit in order to achieve one specific result,and the spirit concerned may never be rnet with again.Wrum on the otherhand envisages calling upon one or more spirits in order to commence aworking relationship, so that on future occasions the same spirits mayassist the magician. In these subsequent relations the full procedure ofevocation is rarely necessary; and will usually only be employed to initiaterelationships with additional spirits.Such exhausting operations therefore are not the be all and end all ofgoetic sorcery. The magician and the spirits with whom they arc involvedwill be active in a variety of other procedures. These will involve a rangeof dif[erent skills and activities, alongside a more minimalist conjuration.The purposes of this book therefore should be becomingclear, althoughtl-re work is not without considerable difficulties. One purpose is to reachbehind the Classical Greek inheritance ro reveal the older srrara of ch-thonic religion. Another is to show, with demonstrations of continuity,the influence of both archaic practice and the archaic practitioner on whatfollowed. This infuence is traced in borh the Classical and Hellenisticperiods and the medieval and Renaissance magic of the grimoires, as wellxii"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"as the inrerim period. In the course of this some familiar mythical andhistorical figures will be re-examined, and some much less familiar onesbrought into the light.Ittythrc LttnguageThe purpose of a re-examination of Greek mythology may be questioned;what has it to do with goetia, aside from goetia being a Greek wordi Forone thing, its inclusion in this study is intended to bring the term howling,by which goetia is often translated, inro its proper conrexr. The spirit sum-moning aspect of the familiar grimoires is more or less compatible withJewish and Christian culture, if not the religious authorities. Nothing in itremotely resembles howling, the atitude is one of sober and fearful piety.There is,like it or not, quite obviously anorher aspecr of the grimoires andits folkloric background where quite other traditions are at work, whichdirectly concern the term goetic and are more closely connected to its ori-gins. This is the background for the mythological material included here.It may still be asked, aside from the cultural distinctions, which areobviously significant, why the mythologyi Part of a comprehensive re-ply concerns the nature of spirits, and of magical working that revolvesaround them.It is relatively unimportant whether such and such a spirir isthe equivalent of such and such a mythic figure,or even an aspecr of them.What is important is the fact that such figures had a myth, and were seenin mythical terms, and that this was a critical aspect of the magic in whichthey played a part. Even late demonologists, who spent time pedanticallytabulating names of whose spelling they were never quire sure, were awareof the need for a story. Myth endows a spirit with a history, a family, aresidence in the universe, and precedents for tasks undertaken on behalfof magicians and their clients.Their likes and dislikes, and aspects of their story, also generally pro-duce the basis for tables of correspondences. While these remain data ina table there is comparatively little magic in them. Endowed with a per-sonality, the spirit becomes an active parricipant in the ritual, and in thecreation of rituals. Reference tables are no replacement for the mythical"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"context of a spell, although with a Litt\\e creativiry they can pafiially substi-tute for the lack of one. That they can do this in fact demonstrates theirreliance on such a context in the past, even if merely as a prototype. Theloss of such a context is displayed in reliance on traditional rituals that areno longer understood, but cannot be adequately replaced. The ghost inthe machine lingers even where the magician has no reference points forthe background of the ritual employed. A mythology supplies such refepence points, giving vitality to the composition and performance of ritual.In recent decades a quiet revolution in mythological studies has tak-en place in the academic world with crucial relevance to goetic magic.lJnsuspected by many modern occultists this revolution has gone be-yond the antiquated and trivialised forms of myth; the glossy productionsof the Ikerary elite of the Classical period still perpetuated in moderncolfee rable books. Dieter Betz underlines this in his Introduction to theGreek Magical Papyri.These papyd are full of references to an older stra'tum of Greek mythology, in which the gods are not portrayed in genteelHellenistic forms but as: caytricious, demonic, and euen dangerous. Theseare the gods of the local cults and of the popular forms of myth, moreprimitive and primal, above all more genuine. Although finding this mate-rial in the papyri appears to surprise the editor of the collection there isrcally no reason why it should. Although - as he remarks - the papyd arcrhus a primary source for the study of Greek folklore, the reverse is equal-ly true: the more primal forms of myth are the bedrock of goetic magic.Whereas \\iterary sources for mythology begin a few hundred yearssce their origins precede these by thousands of years. Of the two earliestsources, Homer - the greatancestor of Western literature - is more prob-lematic than Hesiod. Lack of Homeric precedent cannot be automaticallytaken as proof that such-and-such a theme is of a later date. As observedby Dorothea Wender, Homer erases from the history of the gods all tracesof incestuous relationships, he also suppresses the castration of Ouranosand the child-eating of Kronos. In short, he removes all evidence of theirmore primitive' beginnings; just as he has excised much evidence of magi-cal practices, human-sacrifice and homosexuality among his human cast.There can be no doubt whatever that what he has taken such pains to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONerase was nonetheless present from the earliest times. That later sourcesoften include these themes is not indicative of innovation or fabricationsimply because absent from Homer, even allowing for subsequent changesin form and expression.For, much as the idealised human forms of the Olympian gods suit theprejudices of later rationalism, it is not true rhar in the beginning peoplemade the gods in their own image.In the beginning, people made the godsin the images in which rhey saw rhe gods; like lightning, like volcanoes,like water, like powerful beasts, like life giving or mind altering plants.Until the landlord asked people if they didnt think the gods were morelike him, and his friend the judge, and the judge's friend the king, and likethe priest, and their friends, and their husbands, wives and mistresses.Gods such as these are neither themselves nor the people they idealise.Hesiod by contrast, while roughly contemporary with the Homerictexts, retains much that is primitive, with the major exception of his por-trayal of Zeus,It is readily apparcnt that in the original form of the mythZeus was taken in by the trickster Prometheus, while Hesiod porrrayshim as infallible, allowing Prometheus to think him fooled for his ownreasons. Similarly, Hesiod down'plays Zeus'dethronement of Kronos; asan exemplar of rebellion against parental authority such an act was unwor-thy of the paradigm of fatherhood himself. These examples are enough towarn us against taking the forms of myths as presented by the litenryelite for true representations of more primitive phases of religion. Theyare retellings, often distorted by tendencies to rationalise or to promotelater views. In using literary sources then, rather than take the retelling atfacevalue, the purpose is to unearth traces of older belief in what remains.The contrast between Homer and Hesiod is particularly illustrative.Homer wrote for an aristocratic audience and lived in Asia Minor, thebirthplace of Greek philosophy and much of its higher culture. Hesiod onche other hand lived in rustic Boeotia on the Greek mainland, the liter-ary tradition of which he was part produced among other things divina-tory manuals, almanacs and - interestingly enough - handbooks of metalworking. It is precisely in this'unlearned' conrext that the real roots ofGreek religion are to be traced and its true character discerned.

The academic reapprais-als of this idea are relevant in their own sphere. However, the specula-tive use of mythic emblems for philosophical purposes is a not dissimilarconcept of great relevance to our Purpose.In other words, this might notexplain the origins of all myths, but it does relate to how myth might beunderstood by Greek magicians, among others.So there is another aspect to the question, which is, if mythology isa language, how does it worki Before rea\\Iy addressing this, some ex-amples are useful to illustrate the innate fexibility of mythological lan-grage,some are implicit among the themes explored herein: in the mythsof the birth of Athene from the head of Zeus some uncertainty aboutroles is seen; was it Prometheus or Hephastus, both Lords of Fire, whostruck the blowl How could Hephastus - the limping god - have doneit if Hera created him in revenge for the birth of Athenei The mythicbirth of Dionysus from the thigh of Zeus involves further aPparent con-fusion of roles.

In these scenes gods are seen at once asolder and younger, dying and being born, tragic and comic. It is not thatmyth provides no clear cosmological system, but that it provides a lan-guage by which cosmological ideas are expressed, and by means of whichthey evolve. What is important is not that static forms neither define norconfine myth, but that myth gives life to otherwise static forms.The mythological material presented here is active in precisely this way,it is demonstrative and suggestive in ways that tabulated data or analyticalapproaches are not and cannot be. As will be shown the roots of goe-tia involve gods of fire, andlegendary magicians who discovered haema-tite iron. It will be shown too that goetia was strongly associated withthe more emotionally charged, orgiastic aspecrs of religion. orphic andPythagorean associations represenr a sublimating and rationalisi ng re-form ofjust such traditions. The Orphic and Pythagorean reforms of theolder traditions of Dionysus or Demeter are personified by Apollo; nowa solar god of reason, pursued in more restrained and directed religiousecstasies - the witch-doctor has become the philosopher.In the Classical and Hellenistic periods it is to this more ethereal srarusthat systems termed magic or theurgy aspired. Both theurgy and goetiaborrowed from each other, and were never completely distinguished. Thenames of Orpheus and Zoroaster were intended to lend respectabilityto the rites and books composed in rheir names. In reality, Orphic ritesreverted to chthonic forms even rhough seeking the Apollonian dignity ofcelestial religion, and the rites of the Magi - generally pre-Zoroastrian inorigin - were as barbarous as the goetia Cumont supposed their rites wereintended to replace. Myths were employed to describe this magic, ro ex-plain it, provide authors for its texts and founders for its schools. To reachback through the Orphic reforms to the more primitive levels necessarilyinvolves examination of this mythic background.xvii"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"My intention is nor a complete historical reconstruction of magic and re'ligion of a particular circumscribed historic period; this study involvesseveral phases ofthe past for the purposes ofthe Pfesent. In any case sucha result could not be achieved in this fashion; neither indeed is it likelyto emerge from academic or archaeological disciplines. Orphism is stilldeeply contfovefsial, and the interwoven themes of oriental and Greekmagic and religion involve deeply complex questions pursued and under-stood by highly recondite specialists who nevertheless disagree on manyfundamental issues,Nevertheless, looking at and behind them for contemPorary magicalpurposes is not so difficult, in the manner and for the purpose involvedhere. The purpose of academic historical disciplines is to understandpeoples of older cultures, how they thought, how they behaved. Even so,empathically seeking to apply this understanding in contemPorary life isnever the stated intention. Reaching behind Orphism in the way under-taken here reveals not a historical but a mythic Past. I am not drawing afamiLy tree of dates, times and places in which oriental and Greek ideasinfluenced one another. The relationship of the Orphic reforms and ofgoetia with the Dionysian currents provides a creation myth for trans-forming modern magic.

There is a clear direc-tion underpinning the entire work, which shares its precedent with theancient specialists in necromancy and initiation into rhe Mystery cults.The essential concerns of Orphic initiates and of goetic magicians ornecromancers were and are primarily in one 6eld. Ancient and modernsyntheses alike are necessarily rooted in eschatology. Or to express it instill simpler terms: death, judgemenr, heaven and hell. These concernsfundamentally shaped the worldview and procedure of the papyi a'd thegrimoires; by their very narure, they are as central to the postmodern syn-tlresis of magic. Eschatolo gy dictated the purposes of ritual, irs strucrure,mechanisms and individual componenrs. More fundamentally sdll, theseconcerns shaped perceptions of and responses to the world of spirits.Many of the mythic figures and stories recounred in the course of thiswork may be unfamiliar, but they are vkally important ro rhe study, Thefact is that not only was Greek myth reshaped by the ancient literary elite,but also that until recently classical learning was the exclusive preserve oftheir latte r day counterparts. The preferences of both were serve dby par-ticular emphases, leading to the compararive neglect of others for manyhundreds of years. Magicians have frequently concerned themselves withneglected or marginalised traditions; in very Large degree this now in-cludes Classical learning, stripped of the emphases involved in its formerestablishment form. The chthonic tradirions, which were intimatelyconcerned with the origins of later magic, were already marginalised bytlre end of the Graco-Roman era, and classicists until very recent timesshared similar prejudices. In my opinion this is amplejustification for theemphasis in this study upon mythological material; concerned not withthe Olympian state religion, but the chthonic cults and other traditionswhich underpinned goetia.Before proceeding with the examinarion in the manner outlined here,a few simple points require re-emphasis. The identity of the operarormakes goetia what it is, not the good or bad nature of the spirits involved.Sun and Moon are both as importanr ro goeria as ro asrrology, but thenastrology itself has a fundamentally geocentric foundation.

His was a tempestuous and uninhibited spirit to which actionwas second nature, and dissimulation a stranger.It happened to rne through certain curious chances that I became inti-mate with a certain Sicilian prieft, who was of a very lofty genius andvery \\earned in Greek and Latin literature. It occurred on one occasionin the course of a conversation that he chanced ro Speak of the Art ofNecromancy; regarding which I said: Throughout my whole ltfe I havehad the mo{t intense desire to see or learn something of this Art.To whichremarks the prie$t rejoined: That man who enters upon such an under-taking has need of a {tout heart and frm courage. I answered that of{toutness of heart and firmness of courage I had enough and to Spare,provided the opportunity. Thereupon the prieft answered: If you bavetbe heart to dare it, I will amply satisfy your desire. Accordingly we agreedupon attempting the adventure.This meeting took place in ryg5, significant in the history of magic asthe year of Cornelius Agrippa's death. This was rwo years after the firstcomplete publication of his Occuh Pbilosopby and five years after the pub,lication of The Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences.It was also thirtyyears before the publication of the more practical Fourth Book of OccuhPhilosophy. Regarding this larter book, conrroversy still reigns as to wheth-er or not Agrippa wrote it; in truth only parts of it claim to be written byhim, which it is at least possible that they were. At the time of Cellini sexperience some of these writings had been circulating in manuscript forsome time, and they certainly could have been consulted by the heroesof this narrative. In any case, as will appear, the varieties of ceremonialmagic these writings describe were indeed in conremporary use. It is ofthe very first importance to note that this Sicilian necromancer was, likeAgrippa, no stranger to Classical literature. Such familiarity is usually un-derstated in the grimoires, and even more so by moderns over-infuencedby Kabbalistic interpretations. In reality ro practice magic influenced bythe pagan past was highly suspecr ('to read Greek is to turn heretic'), so"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"such influence was usually disguised or disavowed.Its presence and influ-ence was nevertheless very strong. Considering this Classical backgroundthe location of the necromantic experiment is rather appropriate:The prieft one evening got everyrhing in order, and bade me find acompanion or two. I invited Vincenzio Romoli my very great friend,and the prie$t brought with him a man from Pi$toja, who also ftud-ied Necromancy. Proceeding to the Coliseum, rhe prie$t having robedhimself there after tlte manner of necromancers, ser himself to draw-ing circles on the ground with the mo$t elaborate ceremonial that it ispossible to imagine in the world; and he had made us bring preciousessences and materials for lighting a fire, besides some evil smellingdrugs (asafoetida). When all was in readiness, he made the entranceinto the circle; and taking us by the hand one by one he ser us withinthe circle; then he allotted our duties; he gave the pentacle into thehand of that other necromancer his companion; to us others the careof the fire for the perfumes; then he betook himself to his incantations.The elaborate nature of the circle is not a sulficient clue for us to ascer-tain which text the necromancer was using. At this date ir may well havebeen a circle from the Heptameron which was available in Italy from t4g6,and likely earlier in manuscript form. The Heptameron sets forth rules fordrawing circles that are detailed and elaborate, but there is no solid indica-tion in the text that this was the form used.The insistence on a companion is typical of the Key of Solomon, how-ever the use to which asafoetida is put later in this rite is quite differentfrom that of the Key. Of particular interest to me is the apparent use of asingle fire which appears to have been of reasonable, even substantial, size.This is in accord with such texts as the Grimorium Wrum and the GrandGrimoire.These are often supposed to be semi-spurious and of larcr date,but in fact preserve authentic traditions not found in the Key and otherless overtly demonic grimoires. On the other hand a single censer - alsodescribed as a fire - is recommended by the Heyttameror. However, the useof multiple perfumes also resembles the Grimorium Wrum while utterly"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"distinct from the Heptameron which attributes a single perfume to eachday of the week.Judging from descriptions and the occasional illustrationin various grimoires, this fire or single censer took the form of what wenowadays would call abrazier. It is noteworthy that the Grimorium Wrumand other late French grimoires uniformly retain this feature.This business la$ted more than an hour and a half, there appearedseveral legions of Spirits, to such an extent that the Coliseum was quitefull of them. I was looking after the perfumes, when the prie$ becameaware that there were so large a number present, and turning to mesaid: Benvenuto, ask them something.I called on them to reunite mewith my Sicilian Angelica. On that night we received no answer; butI took the very greate$t satisfa&ion from it, my intere5t being muchencouraged.'This business' evidently alludes to the construction of the circle and therecrtal of conjurations. Modern ceremonial is often more abbreviated, and,let it be said,less effective. A preliminary banishing ritual and invocationsas prescribed by nineteenth century magicians might take half this time.Note too that there is absolutely no mention of any triangle of manifes-tation outside the circle. This adjunct to evocations probably is not a con-sistent feature of the grimoires. In its modern form it derives from men-tion by Weyer, elaborated in the Goetia of Solomon, and taken for grantedby most modern magicians. That it would serve no purpose whateverwhen legions of spirits apper, being large enough for one human sizedentity at the most, does rather militate against its utiliry in some concep-tions of magical procedures.The necromancer said that it would be necessary for us to go anothertime, and that I should be satisfied in re{pe& of all that I asked, butthat he wished me to take with me a little lad of pure virginity. I tookone of my shop-boys, who was about twelve years old, and I invitedVincenzio Romoli again; and a certain Agnolino Gaddi, who was ourintimate friend."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"GOE'| IA & THE GRIMOIRESThis employment of a child clairvoyant is typical of many operarions inthe papyri. These evolved into the Art Armadel, a highly infuential pro-cedure which is incorporated in many important grimoires. A detailedcommentary on this type of operation can be found in my edition of TheTrue Grimoire.Here it is only necessary to say that the rite is undoubtedlyancient, providing clear evidence of the pre-Christian precursors of thegrimoires.When we arrived again at the appointed Spot, the necromancer havingmade the same preparations with that same and even more wonder-ful precision, ser us within the circle, which he had again made withmore wondrous art and more wondrous ceremonies; then to my friendVincenzio he gave the charge of the perfumes and of the fire; and withhim the said Agnolino Gaddi; then he put the pentacle into my hand,which he told me that I muft turn in the dire&ion towards the pointshe indicated to me, and beneath the pentacle I Stationed that little lad,my shop-boy.This use of the pentacle is important, details of its construction or ap'pearance being present in many grimoires without clear instructions onits use. In The True Grimoire it is recommended that such a pentacle beplaced at the four points of the compass. In the Key of Solomon otherpentacles are to be worn by the magician beneath a veil and shown to thespirits at need. The procedure here appears to combine both approaches,and refects the older traditions regarding a Seal or Pentacle of Solomon.The form in the Key is probably considerab|y larcr, numerous complexand specialised pentacles replacing the single ubiquitous form of the sin-gular Pentacle of Solomon.The necromancer commenced to utter those very terrible invocations,calling by name a multitude of demons, the chiefs of legions of $irirs,and summoned them by the Virtue and Power of God, the uncreated,Living and Eternal, in the Hebrew language, and very frequently besidesin Greek and Latin; to such purpose that in a short fpace of time they"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAfilled the whole Coliseum a hundredfold as many as had appearedthat 6r$t time. Mncenzio Romoli, together with Agnolino artended tokeeping up the 6re, and heaped on quantities of precious perfumes.

That within the lpace of one month you will be whereshe is? Then again he prayed me to Stand 6rm by him, for the legionswere a thousandfold more than he had summoned, and that they werethe mo$t dangerous of infernal Spirits; and since rhey had settled whatI had asked, it was necessary to be civil to them; and patiently dismiss them.The phrase'Virtue and Power of God'bears some resemblance to the textcalled the Ars Notoria, while a similar expression occurs in the Key; how'ever the term may be a general one. It is plain enough that the spirits an-swered the question of the necromancer, and while terrifred he was readyenough to deal with them without threats or curses.On the other hand the lad who was beneath the pentacle, in greate$tterror said, there were a million of the fierce$t men swarming roundand threatening us. He said besides that four enormous giants hadappeared, who were ftriving to force their way into the circle. All thewhile the necromancer, trembling with fright, endeavoured wirh mildand gentle persuasions to dismiss them. Vincenzio Romoli, who wastrembling like a reed in the wind,looked after the perfumes.I, who wasas much in fear as the re$t, endeavoured to show less, and to inSpirethem all with the moft marvellous courage; but the truth is I thoughtmyself a dead man on seeing the terror of the necromancer himself.The lad had placed his head between his knees, sayingr Tbis is how Iwill meet death, for we are all dead men. Again I said to the lad: Thesecreatures are all inferior to us, and what you see is but smoke and shadow;tberefore raise your eyes. When he had raised them, he cried out againrThe whole Coliseum is in flames, and tbe fre is coming down upon us: andcovering his face with his hands, he said again that he was dead, andthat he could not endure the sight any longer."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The position of the child seer beneath the pentacle is interesting, it un-derlines the protective nature of the symbol and additionally suggests thatCellini turned the pentacle this way and that rather than caffy it to thevarious quarters. The impression created by these references implies thatthe pentacle was of a fairly large size, probably requiring both hands. Thepentacle would be made from the virgin parchmenr upon which such em-phasis is placed in many grimoires. The reader should bear in mind itscentral place in such magic, and that the parchment was obtained from asacrificed goat or lamb. This vital ralismanic object has unsuspected an-cient roors in remore anriquity, which will be examined in Book Two.As Skinner and Rankine note, the four enormous giants, who cannorhave been gathered at a single point, may well represent the Four Kingsof the Cardinal Points who are frequently mentioned in goetic texts. Inthe midst of the ceremony Cellini declared that the spirits are inferiorto humans, who according to holy writ have a special place in God's dis-pensation. In context this has the ring of vainglory, an artempt to inspirecourage rather than a statement of con{rdent belief,The necromancer appealed to me to keep Steady, and to dire& themto throw asafoetida upon the coals: so turning to Vincenzio Romoli Itold him to make the fumigation at once.

Qgite unex-pectedly, in the process of elucidating the history of magic in the worldof the Greeks, the voyage of the Argonauts emerged as a major theme. Intime, as work progressed, there arose the need for a structure intercon-necting the themes involved. These concerned geographical and ethno-logical issues, as well as the evolution of rituals and other aspecrs of goeticmagic. The travels of the Argonauts presented such a srructure: their voy-age at once rePresenting shamanic travel, the rise, fall and renaissance ofchthonic religion, and an interconnecting roure through the Mysrery culrsand foreign influences on Greek traditions.In the preliminary stages of expanding the work ro cover the wider his-torical concerns, the need for a gallery of imporrant characters, historicaland mythical became apparent. Many of these characters were involved insome way with the Voyage of the Argo, or Argonautica.Addidonally, the re-semblance of this gaLlery ro rhe roll call of crew members ar the beginningof the Argonauticd was striking and strangely appealing. It also became"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"apparent that many other topics important to the study were involvedin the voyage of the Argo. The geography of the Argonautica suited mypurposes very well; a shamanic journey from Thessaly, land of classicalwitchcraft to Colchis home of the major witch figures of classical myth.One the way important sites and persons are encountered, and the returntravels across Europe (represented by the grimoires) to the west coast ofItaly and an African climax.Accordingly, without more ado, the Argonauticabecamepart and parcelof the structure of the work. At first glance an epic Poem may seem adistant concern from elucidating the background to the magic of the gri-moires. If present, this impression will hopefully disappear as the readerundertakes the journey involved. The decision to make a commentary onthe Argonautica a key element of the book has an additional virtue. Manyreferences to the Greek elements in occultism focus on Hermeticismor other philosophical traditions. Goetia is older than any of these, be-ing more closely related to the roots of mythology in archaic ritual. TheArgonautica LS an excellent vehicle for introducing themes of this nature.The only complete text of this ancient legend is the Argonautica com-posed by Apollonius of Rhodes. This is a much later composition thanthe Homeric epics, which the author consciously imitated in many re-specrs. Apollonius was a resident of Alexandria, then the intellectual cen-tre of the world. He was to become the director of the famous Libtaty inthe time of Ptolemy the Third. His first attempt at writing this Poem wasso badly received that he retired to Rhodes. Here he revised his text, andreturned to a triumphant reception in Alexandria. Unlike other poets ofhis time Apollonius did not break with older poetic tradition but built onit. This and. his unparalleled access to ancient literature and earlie r ver-sions of the legend is a major compensation for the comparative latenessof the text, which dates from the middle of the third century BcE.An importanr difference from Homer is Apollonius'srrong sympathywith the old Mystery cults, and dissatisfaction with the Olympian statereligion. In this he is typical of many intellectuals, in Alexandria andthroughout the Hellenistic world. This represents the revival of chthonicreligious traditions, of which Orphism was a Potent cause. Some have"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"gone so far as to call the Argonautica an Orphic book in its own right.There is a strong shamanic motif central to rhe epic, which has as one ofits objectives the recovery of a soul from a distant place: For Pbrixus bid-deth us go to the halls of Aeetes, and bring his spirit home (Pindar's PythianOde IV).In part this explains the attraction of the theme for an author ofApollonius'sympathies, as also its relevance ro our study.Those familiar with the story will doubtless be aware that many aspecrsof the voyage are geographically impossible. one reason is the relative ig-norance of geography when the epic lirst took shape, serring precedentswhich better informed later writers followed out of reverence for tradition.It is also panially the result of combining originally distinct legendaryjourneys, with differing destinarions and stages. Another reason howeveris that earthly geography has little to do with several aspects of the myrh,which are concerned with a voyage into a magical realm. Elastic geogra-phy is a regular feature of Greek myth in general. There are at least fourand perhaps as many as six locations for Mount Olympus. The route andindeed the destination of the Argonauts are similarly cloaked in mystery.The legend contains, beside its central objectives, many magical themesof great antiquity and clues to archaic elements of Greek religion. Some ofthe more salient, as they appear in the epic of Apollonius, are noted here.The epic begins with the arrival ofJason ar rhe courr of the usurper,Pelias, in the city of Iolcus in Thessaly. This norrhernmost region ofGreece bordered Macedonia to the norrh; ro the west Illyria and Epiros,with the sea to the East. Of the various myrhic locations of MountOlympus, the Classical site was in Thessaly. The inhabitants of the regionwere notoriously given to magical practices and barbarous incantations.It is thus a suitable starting place for a study of archaic magic in Grecianculture. It is doubly so since, having the sea to the East, the departure ofthe Argo is from Thessaly towards the Black Sea. This geographically andsymbolically puts Classical Greece behind us, and enrers the terrain ofmyth and ancient ritual wherein Goetia is rooted.King Pelias had dispossessed Jason's father, and Jason's return was arthe advice of an oracle to seek and claim his inheritance. On the way rherehe had crossed a llooded river and carried an old woman across, who was"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the goddess Hera in disguise. In getting across he lost a sandal, and thusarrived at the city with one bare foot. The single sandal is frequently foundas an emblem of Hecate, while carryinga woman across a river features inimportant Balkan folk rituals. Interesting as these details arc it. is perhapsunwise to place too much emphasis on them at this point. However, therest ofJasons costume consisted of leather buskins and the skin of a leop-ard, the characteristic costume of Dionysus. These details of Jasons ap-pearance certainly suggest a ritualistic background. Curiously the name ofthe fooded river, Anaurus, is shared with a river of Mount Ida in Phrygia.When he arrived in Iolcus Jason encountered the king, who had beenwarned by an oracle to beware a man with one sandal, who would causehis death. WhenJason demanded his inheritance Pelias agreed, on condi-tion he frrst fetch the golden fleece from Colchis.The fleece was that of a sacred ram, and would likely originally have beenblack, possibly dyed purple, as with sacred rams in Crere, Samothrace andelsewhere. Ram skins of this kind were worn in important purifrcation rit-uals and were obtained from sacrificial victims. It is extremely importantto nore that the ram was by far the most common sacrificial victim olferedto heroes. The idea of a golden fl,eece, and the likely change in colour fromthe original, derives from the use of fleeces to caPture gold particles in ariver bed. Both the Hebrus in Thrace and the Phasis in Colchis were goldbearing rivers. A common relative of Jason and Pelias, Phrixus, had fedto Colchis with this ram, and there been basely murdered and buried farfrom home. As a result his homeland was cursed, and the PurPose of thequest was to rescue the unquiet spirit and lift the curse."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"PREPARATION €n DtjpARTUREColcbiswhar was rhe old colchian magic, bur the minute ftudy of Naturein her lowliedt worksi what the fable of Medea, but a proof of thepowers rhar may be extra&ed from the germ and leafi lTheyl soughtin the meaneft herbs whar, perhaps, the Babylonian sages explored invain amid$t the loftieft Stars.Bulwer-Lytton, ZanoniThe destination of rhe Argonauts was Colchis, a counrry to the easr ofthe Black Sea, now in modern Georgia.

It wasthe birthplace of Medea, and most productive of potent magical herbs ar-rdpoisons. There was a longstanding Classical tradition that its inhabitantswere originally Egyptians, colonists from the tirne of Sesostris (believedto be Rameses the Great). Herodotus records that the Colchians well re-membered their Egyprian origins, and retained such Egyptian practices ascircumcision, as well as physically resembling their one time counrrymen.He mentions as further confirmation their distincrive manner of weaving,elements of their language, and the testimony of his Egyptian informants.This was accepred as fact by nineteenth century mythographers such asLempridre.

Older versionsappear to have involved a quest for amber, a commodity with importantsacred connotations in Mycen&anculture. Many places on the roure of theArgonauts expedition were associated with this ancient trade. Of particu-lar interest perhaps is the island of Samothrace, also known as the Islandof Electra. Electra was the daughter of Atlas and her name means Amber.Samothrace therefore can also be referred to as the Island of Amber. TheAncient Greeks discovered that amber behaved strangely, for example at-tracting feathers when rubbed by fur, silk and so on. Elektron is their wordfor amber and we obtain our words electron, electricity, &c. from this.The Latin word electricus refers to the effects of friction on amber. Theseproperties placed amber in a similar class to magnets magically. In addi-tion the Greek word elektor literally lneans beaming sun, giving ambersolar connotations relevant to the themes of this book.The ArgoApollonius does not describe the building of the ship, named the Argo,supposedly out of deference to earlier poets who had done so. However,there are good reasons not to follow his example. Given the nature of thequest undertaken by the Argonauts, the ship takes on a significance thathas been insufficiently underlined. The ship serves the same purpose asthe arrow of Hyperborean Abaris, or the flying drum of shamans fromTibet and elsewhere.It is a vehicle for entering the other-world.Various etymologies have been proposed for the name of the ship. Somefy in the face of tradition, saying it was called Argo because launched fromArgos, whereas tradition has it built and launched at Pagasa. Others sayit bore that name because it was full of Greeks, commonly called Argives.Another suggestion is that it was named after the man who built it, butwhether he was part of the original story cannot now be known and hernay equally well have been added to the story and designated the builderbecause of the name of the ship.

By contrast the most ancient roots of the word arrow, which is ofIndo-European origin, are not known but inferred by philologists. It istherefore not beyond the bounds of philological possibility, in phoneticsand meaning, that arrow derives from the same root as Argo. The rootsof Argo and Ark are apparently as distant as Parnassus from Ararat, sincethe Indo-European root of Ark means secret, closed or kept safe, as inarcane, However, the same implied root for arrow is shared by the Latinarcus meaning a bow. Archery and the architectural arch are from a com-mon root. However the secret of the celestial ship is not the making ofarches, but the making of 6re with a bow which was originally a 6re drillas well as a weapon. Such wordplay though here presented hesitantly andparenthetically, would commend itself to the Greeks.)According to Apollonius and other authors Argo was built at Jason'srequest by a hero named Argus. It was built at Pagasx in ThessalianMagnesia, from the pines of Mount Pelion.Important traditions concern-ing various places named Magnesia and the erymological connection withmagnetic ore will be discussed in Book Four. A beam of the prow, possiblya figurehead, was cut by Athena herself from an oak at Dodona. Thiswas the site of a famous oracular grove more ancient than Delphi, whichdemonstrates the antiquity of the legend. She conferred on this beam thepower of speech, so that it was able to grant oracles to the Argonauts dur-ing the voyage.The Oracle of Dodona was located in the region of Thesprotia inEpiros; upon a mountain named Tmarus (lli\"y names it Tomarus).It was according to all traditions the oldest in Greece, founded by thePelasgians, often considered a pre-Hellenic race but in reality probablymore an older level of culture than a distinct ethnic group, taditionallyit was associated with Zeus, although the earlier dedication was perhaps"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"to an earth goddess. The Pelasgians and their traditions were consideredamong the most ancient in the world. They were dispersed in several parrsof Greece, including Epiros, Thessaly and Peloponnesus, as well as Italy,Crete and various Aegean islands.The Oracle took its name from a nearby town, this and the temple ofZeus were said to have been built either by Deucalian, or by Pelasgus.Herodotus, who knew the priestesses of Dodona personally, made an in-teresting statement about its antiquity. He said that the Pelasgians whoworshipped there did not at that time distinguish the gods in name ortitle. The importance of this statement may have been previously over-looked. Taken with his recording their use of the rcrm tbeoi it stronglysuggests a cult similar to the Cabiric cult of the megala theoi or greatgods.Indeedjust before this he mentions the use of phallic images taught to theGreeks by the Pelasgians, resembling those of Samothrace. Probably theoriginal male deity of Dodona had resembled the Thracian'Hero'; whopossessed several qualities, and was the son and lover of the goddess. Inlater Greek use these attributes of the Hero were separated into distinctdivine roles with different names. Pelasgus, the ancestor of the Pelasgians,was called a son of the earth goddess, or alternatively of Zeus and Niobe.These details support the idea that the traditions of the Pelasgians andThracians had a good deal in common.The Greeks themselves were of the opinion that the oracles were origi-nally connected with the earth goddess and chthonic powers. The oracu-lar response of the god was divined from the wind rustling in the trees,most particularly oaks, although beeches are mentioned. Apparently suchsounds were magnified by hanging brazen vessels from the branches.These would clang against one another in the wind, and chese soundswere then interpreted. Originally it was believed the oracle was derivedfrom the murmurings of a fountain, which was afterwards changed.Again according to tradition the original oracles were interpreted bymen, but later by women, The priests were known as Selloi, occasion-ally given as Helloi. The priestesses were called Peleads, and may havebeen two in number (according to Sophocles in his Trachinie), whileHerodotus mentions three. Their name derives from the word for dove;"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"and according to Herodotus the oracle was founded by a dove. Two blackdoves, perhaps pigeons, took fight from the city of Thebes in Egypt. Onealighted at the temple ofJupiter Ammon in Libya, the other at Dodona.With a human voice they declared that the ground was consecrated byJupiter, and would be the sites of oracles. One interpretation held this toresult from the fact that the word for doves in many parts of Greece signi-fied old women in Epiros.The nearby mountain of Parnassus was where the ship of Deucalion,the Greek Noah, came to rest after the flood. It is worthy of note thatDeucalion was the son of Prometheus, the Lord of Fire and the maker ofmen. The influence of this oracle was later supplanted by Delphi, but inthe Heroic Age Dodona was the most prestigious oracle in Greece.The Heroes AssembleThe roll call of heroes forming the crew of the Argo differs widely fromone ancient author to the next. f'he archaic form of the legend was al-ready well known when Homer composed his epics, and he names onlyJason. The involvement of the Theban hero, Heracles, is likely alate in-terpolation; the Argonautica is essentially a Thessalian epic. A traditionof frfty oarsmen is likely an original part of the story and for the mostpart no names are really required, The names that subsequently accumu-lated may represent story-tellers gratifying their listeners by including lo-cal favourites, or claim staking by Greek states to trading rights in theBlack Sea, breaking a tojan monopoly. Whatever the explanation, mycrew will remain largely nameless. The most important figures for thisstudy are Jason; Peleus, who is the father of Achilles; Orpheus; Mopsusthe soothsayer; Argts; Aethalides; Idmon the prophet and son of Apolloand Cyrene; and the Dioscuri, Castor and Polydeuces.The assembled heroes received, in addition to the title Argonauts, rhedesignation of Minyans.

These too contained fighters, prorecring the godon his underworld journey, but also gods of magic and a helmsman. Thesouls of the departed also sought passage in these solar boats; this likelysupplied the prototype for Charon the ferryman of Hades. These themesare mirrored in the symbolism of an otherworldly journey implicit in thevoyage of the Argo. Another similarity is to be found in the islands andother locations, each with distinct perils of their own, encountered in theEgyptian underworld.Before their departure the Argonauts offered sacrifice to Apollo, in hisrole of god of shores and embarkation. This is an interesting and signi{i-cant role of the god of prophecy, so important to the inspired magiciansof this study. The altar was formed from the shingle of the beach, uponwhich a fire of olive-wood was built. Two oxen were brought forward tothe altar by the youngest heroes present. Lustral water and barley-cornswere carried by the others. The pruyer to Apollo was made byJason him-sel[, sprinkling barley-corns while he prayed. The sacrifice was then made,and as on every occasion Apollonius describes the procedure exactly.

His legend credits him with being present at the hunt ofthe Calydonian boar. He was also one of the Argonauts, whose voyagecontains shamanic elements and more or less explicit references to theMysteries. This voyage interconnects many of the figures in this gallery.He was a famous prophet, and on this account was called a son of Apollo.He attempted to avoid taking part in Adrastus'war against Thebes, know-ing he was doomed to die there, but was betrayedby his wife in return fora bribe. His chariot was swallowed up by the earth during a rout in thiswar, thereupon Zeus made him immortal.In accordance with his wishes,when news reached his son of his death, he slew his treacherous mother.Amphiarus received divine honours after death, with a statue and oracularshrine at Oropus in Attica. Like Aeacos, he too is invoked in the MagicalPapyri (see ncrnr w 1445 and footnote). Some scholars prefer to see oracu-lar heroes of his type as gods from the outseu some are certainly survivalsfrom earlier phases of religion. Those who desired to consult the oracle ofAmphiarus were required to undertake a fast of twenty-four hours with-out food and three times as long without wine. After this they sacrificed aram, and laying the fleece upon the ground spent the night sleeping uponit in expectation of a prophetic dream. Such ritual use of the feece liesbehind the legend of tl-re Golden Fleece itself,, and the mysterious virginparchment from which the Pentacle of Solomon and other important ar-tefacts of ritual magic are made. During the time of Xerxes, according toPlutarch, a servant of Mardonius sought such an oracle for his masterwho was with the arnry opposing the Persians. In his dream he saw thepriest of the shrine shouting at him and throwing stones at his head as ifto drive him away. This oracle was fulfilled in the death of Mardonius bya stone striking his head. This form of dream oracle was typical of suchshrines; not containing obscure symbolic elements but a straightforwardvisitation of a priest or god. Near his temple was a sacred fountain. Onlythose who had consulted his oracle or received a cure were permitted tobathe there. In gratitude they cast gold and silver into the waters."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MopsusThere are two seers or prophets of this name in Greek mythology. Thefirst was born in Thessaly, a region of Greece famous for its witches, in thecity of Titaressa. He was the son of Ampyx and Chloris. Of the several se-ers on the voyage of the Argonauts Mopsus is perhaps the most significantin several respects. On the return of the Argonauts from Colchis Mopsuswas bitten by a snake while the Argonauts were in Libya. A shrine builtto him on the sea-shore became the site of a temple where oracles werereceived from him.The other Mopsus, if indeed they are truly distinct, was also a seer, be-ing the son of Apollo by the Sibyl Manto, who was daughter of Tiresias.He lived at the time of the tojan War. The city of Colophon is said tohave been built by him, and he performed wonders at the famed templeof Apollo at nearby Claros. He founded the city of Mallos in Cilicia withhis fellow seer Amphilochus, who was also a son of Manto. During a visitof the Iatter seer to Argos Mopsus took possession of the town, and afight resulted between them in which both were killed. After death he washonoured as a god, and had an oracle at Mallos, celebrated for true anddecisive answers.As remarked in discussing Calchas, he and Mopsus both had a col-league of the same name, and proliferating oracular sites are associatedwith them all. The serpent turned to stone on the occasion of the sacrificebefore the Trojan expedition is reminiscent of the archaic dragon imageof Apollo on the Isle of Delos. If so it may have been a primitive emblemof the pre-Olympian - one might say the original Hyperborean - Apollo.Calchas, Mopsus and Amphilochus all appear to have been involved insuch a cult, in a period before the rise of Delphi and the Classical idealsof Pan-Hellenism.Autoleon or LconymusAutoleon was a general of Crotona (where Pythagoras founded his school)who fought against the Locrians. His legend includes many significant"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"elements, including a healing journey and meetings with residents of theUnderworld. The Locrians had a tradition of leaving a gap in their ranksin honour of their ancestor, one of two Homeric heroes named Ajax. Inthe battle Autoleon sought to pass through this gap, and was wounded(either in the rhigh or breast) by the ghost of Ajax. The wound wouldnot heal, and he was advised by the Delphic Oracle to travel to the WhiteIsland and offer sacrifice to Ajax of Locri. This island in some accounrs isat the mouth of the Danube in the Black Sea, but this is likely to be alateraddition. The island is associated with the Elysian Fields, the happiest andmost exclusive region of the Underworld. Here he met Helen, who toldhim to seek out the poet Stesichorus (fourish ed sse ecE). This poet hadapparently been struck blind for including a slander of her in one of hispoems. On singing a retraction his sight was restored. Plato menrions thisepisode in the Phadrus, where the first line is quoted: False is that wordof mine - the trutb is tbat thou didst not embark in ships, nor ever go to thewalls oi Troy ...Autoleon, otherwise called Leonymus, also rerurned healed, tellinghow he had met the spirit of Achilles - now married to Helen - and ofPatroclus, Antilochus, Ajax of Telamon and finally Ajax of Locri, who hadcured him. That this journey was in any sense geographical seems highlyunlikely, requiring a man with a life threatening wound to travel fromItaly, first to Greece and from there to an otherworldly island still moreremote, A'poet' is required to intercede for him, while in some rnagicalmanner also preserving himself from a mysterious female, this has all thehallmarks of a magical healing rite. Hades means sightless, so via the kindof pun beloved by the Greeks, a poet recovering his sight is returning fromHades. Helens rnythological role involves far more than a pretty face, andshe belongs in mythic rather than historic time. She was a twin sister ofthe Dioscuri, who are represented as Argonauts a generation before thetojan War.In fact Autoleon's journey bears comparison with the voyageof the Argo; a magical journey associated with an Oracle, on a quesr torescue a soul."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"C alcb rt s, otb er w i s e C alcb antisCalchas was a famed soothsayer residing at Mycenae or Megara. Hisgrandfather, Idmon, had been a seer with the Argonaut's expedition. Thefather of Calchas was Thestor, aTrojan priest of Apollo, and Calchas trai-torously served the Greeks against his native city. His art, which was be-stowed upon him by Apollo, involved interpretation of the fight of birds,and he knew past, present and future. There are many accounts of omenreading and prophecy by Calchas, of which a few are given here. WhenAchilles was only nine years old Calchas foretold that Troy could not betaken without him. He was chosen to be high priest of the Greek expe-dition to Troy. After a pre-embarkation sacri{ice a snake appeared fromunder an altar; it swallowed eight birds in a nearby ftee, then their moth-er, whereupon it turned to stone. Calchas foretold from this omen thatTroy would not be taken in nine years, but in the tenth.

Amphilochuswas a son of Amphiaros, and these shrines may have involved his cult.Curiously the great rival of Calchas, Mopsus, also had a colleague namedAmphilochus.Calchas had been told that he would perish upon meering a divinermore skilful than himself. After the tojan War this came about at Claros,where there was a noted shrine of Apollo. Here he competed with theseer Mopsus, 6rst he was unable to say how many figs were on a cerraintree, while Mopsus told the exacr number; a second challenge to foretellthe size of an unborn litter of pigs was also won by Mopsus. Calchas thendied of gri ef . After his death he had an oracle at Daunia inltaly,which wasa Greek city in northern Apulia. Here local legend told of a king Calchas.This king loved Cftce, who rejected his advances on account of the loveshe bore Odysseus. She turned Calchas inro a pig and shut him in a sty,his subjects came looking for him, and she rurned him back on conditionhe never returned to her island. There are also south Italian legends of adiviner named Calchas. His tomb, likely an oracular shrine, was ar Sirisin Tarentum, the site of a Greek colony founded after the war with Troy.There was also an incubatory shrine of Calchas on Mount Garganus inApulia on the Adriatic coast. An alternative story of the death of Calchasalso concerns a rival prophet, who foretold of a vine that Calchas wouldnever enjoy its vintage. He repeated this prophecy when Calchas came rotaste the wine, and Calchas choked to death on tasring ir.OnomacritosA soothsayer of Athens, he flourished around 516 nce. He was a teacher of aform of Orphism. Modern academics associate Orphism with Pythagoreansects and Onomacritos was a contemp orary of Pythagoras, A poem on thevoyage of the Argonauts attributed to Orpheus is believed to have beenhis work, as are the elegant poems attributed to Musaus. He was expelledfrom Athens by Hipparchus, a son of Pisistratus, Herodotus records atradition that his oflence was forging oracles, but this charge is likely tohave been politically inspired."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"More importantly, such references in Herodotus and other sources allowus to pinpoint the period of composition of the Orphic texts. That theclaim of these texts to be older than Homer was rejected by Herodotusshould not obscure the fact that Orphism genuinely was both a reformand a revival of more ancient traditions. It involved both non-aristo craticand foreign elements, and was not always welcomed by either the officialcults of the city states or the unreformed Dionysian tradition. The impor-tance of the Orphic books in the development of the grimoire traditionis alluded to at various points in this volume. It is now widely recognisedthat the unorthodox movements these books represent signal the 6rst de-velopment of individualism in religious expression.OrpheusThe origins of Orpheus in Thrace are ancient. How long his history inThrace precedes his arrival in Greece is currently impossible to say withany certainty. Orphism in Greece dates to around the beginning of the 6'r'century, which is within a century of the setting down of the Homeric ep-ics in written form. Various mystical and magical works attributed to himare similarly old, although the Orphic LIymns date to the Rornan period.His importance in the history of magic explains the fact that referencesin Cornelius Agrippa to Orpheus are extremely numerous. Eliade, in hisclassic work Sbamanism - Arcbaic Techniques of Ecstasy, points out thatmost of the major features of the myth of Orpheus have direct shamanicanalogues. He goes so far as to call the shamanic descent to the under-world to rescue a soul tbe Orpbeus motif. Dodds underlines his Thracianorigins and his role there, as either an associate or a worshipper of a godidentified by the Greeks as Apollo. These connections remain importantwhether or not shamanism is an appropriate term in Greek studies.The presence of elements comparablewith shamanism in ancient Greekreligious culture has been approached in various ways by anthropologists,historians and other academics. Several of them have pointed to facetsof archaic Greek religion, and to later developments, as reminiscent ofshamanism. Others have objected to the use of the culturally speci{ic term"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"shaman in such a context, and Burkert in particular has shown goes to bea prefbrable and indigenous rerm.Controversy continues as to whether these elements were indigenous,or reflecr external influences; and if the latter from where and at whatperiod.It has been suggested that they may have entered Greek culture byu'a1' of increased contacr with the Scythians and with Thrace in the sev-enth century BCE, There are various interesting aspecrs to this argumenr,but also some difficulties and limitations. For one thing, external shaman-isrn does not explain significant indigenous traditions considerably earlierthan this date. There are also older resemblances ro Thrace presenr in thearchaic religious traditions of Mycenaean Greece (16oo ro rroo ecr).Another difficulty involves several individuals within the proposedtirneframe, who have been portrayed as Greek shamans or as drawing onshamanism. Several, if not all of them, were connected with Myst ery reli-sions far older than the seventh century. A possible resolution of rhese dif-ficulties is that contact with the Black Sea region merged with and revivedarchaic elements already present in Greek culture. Certain affinities, suchas their connecrion with ideas about the soul, may have made for a readycombination with external traditions. Equally however the nature of rheindigenous elemenrs played a part in this compatibility.It is interesting that E.R. Dodds points to the seventh cenrury BCE asthe date of entry of external shamanic elements. In a separare referencehe indicates that the seventh century is the earliest date for which wehave any information regarding the teachings of the Mysteries of Eleusis.This coincidence, while not explaining the enrire srory, presents us withan appropriate symbol; a symbol of the mysterious relationship existingbetween supposed shamans and archaic Greek traditions centred on theMystery religions. As I hope to make clear, this symbol has an intimateconnection with the figure of the goeric magician.Several of the historical and mythological names associated with the ac-ademic controversy concerning Greek shamanism were linked with Crete,the earliest of the Greek culrures. Their initiation into the Mysteries -involving the birth of Zeus in one of the cave sancruaries of the island- constitutes a major part of the comparison with shamanism. This initia-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"tion involved fasting, purification, tfance and ajourney to the Underworld,among other features. From their experiences these initiates obtained wis-dom, and powers including weather magic, healing and prophecy'A further difficulty arises here insofar as the oldest traditions of MinoanCrete were not that closely related to Mycenean religion. The Mysteryreligion of Crete therefore must involve imported Mycenean themes,while possessing some features unique to the island. There is consider-able evidence for the integration and synthesis of the Mystery religionsof Crete, Samothrace, Asia Minor and elsewhere during the histo rical pe'riod. Despite such changes these cult centres preserved traditions of greatantiquity, whether originally indigenous to one or other of them or not.In their studies of the Greek shamans both Eliade and Dodds empha-sise the same points as decisive: Orpheus as culture hero,his Power overand affinity with nature in all its forms, his combining the roles of ma-gician, poet, religious teacher and giver of oracles; his rescue mission tothe Underworld, and the powef retained by his head after death. Doddsconcludes that Orpheus is a magical frgure of the Zalmoxis type, eithet amythical shaman or a prototype of Thracian shamans.To this should perhaps be added the ambivalent sexuality frequentlyassociated with shamans; Orpheus and Thamyris are associated with ho-mosexuality as well as heterosexual love affairs, and this is also a featureof the myth of Dionysus. The homosexual adventures of Orpheus andDionysus both occur after a visit to the LJnderworld to rescue a female. Sofar as I am aware this has not been remarked on previously, and it wouldbe interesting to know how it is interpreted by the academic community.Orpheus was celebrated by the Greeks as the greatest poet and magi-cian who ever lived. He was credited with founding the Mysteries and thearc of prophecy, augury by birds particularly. According to the most reli-able accounts he was a prince of Thrace, son of King Oeager and Calliopethe Muse. In Greek myth he lived at the time of the expedition of theArgonauts which he joined. In keeping with his importance, after JasonOrpheus is the first of the Argonauts to be named by Apollonius. There isa tradition that he had previously travelled in EgyPr. Diodurus credits to"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"rhese travels the similarity of the Mysteries of Dionysus and Osiris in thelate period, a similariry supporred by Plutarch.He received the lyre from the god Apollo or as others say, from Hermes(who is also said to have bestowed the lyre on Apollo). Some accounts alsornake him the son of Apollo, but this is likely to be a Greek innovationadding further prestige to his music. It is more interesting ro nore rhatHermes is said to have bestowed the lyre upon Apollo as well as orpheus.This potendally makes orpheus an equivalent of Apollo himselfl, ratherthan his son. The ambiguity also underlines the sharing of attributes be-tween Hermes and Apollo, a conficr unresolved by rationalising mythog-raphers. That both gods are to a degree specialised aspects of an earherconcept of deiry is important to bear in mind in understanding Orpheus.The lyre in Greek culture was often contrasted with the double flute orpipes associated rightly or otherwise with barbarian cults. This conflict ishighlighted in the myth of Marsyas, often said to have invented the doubleflute, he like orpheus and Linus was sometimes called a son of Oeager.Marsyas'origins were Phrygian, and he was associated with the cult ofCybele, as well as with Dionysus and Bacchus. The slaying of Marsyas byApollo is of course reminiscent of the murder of other gods in Mysterycults. In Greek myth the musical contest between fute playing Marsyasand lyre strumming Apollo represents civilised versus barbarian ritual ac-cording to the prejudices of the urban literati. This symbolic confict ob-scures the origins of the myth in the Phrygian cult. A Phrygian image ofCybele has two much smaller figures below and on either side, one withflute, the other with lyre. Their size indicates that both are human, andthe likelihood is that the myth originates in rituals in which both instru-ments played apaft.The mythology of Marsyas thus indicates the primitive origins, not onlyof Marsyas but of pre-orphic Apollo. Another Thracian singer namedThamyris is said to have challenged the Muses in a similar manner. Uponbeating him the Muses deprived him of the power of sight and of singing,which likely rreans death. Thamyris and Orpheus are mentioned togetherin the Vision of Er, selecring their next incarnations as birds."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The reality of the myth of both Marsyas and Thamyris is likely to lay inthe association of Cybele in her Phrygian form with rituals involving theking priest, which refected the Thracian origins of her cult. Such kingpriests would have led rituals involving music and ecstatic dance, and thegoddess would also have played a major part in their funeral rites. Thesetwo roles were to become completely conflated in Greek mythology. Themyth of the contest of Apollo and Marsyas involves King Midas, who ac-cording to various versions claimed the judgement in Apollo's favour wasunfair (which it was) and that he was the only judge to frnd in favour ofMarsyas. Another form credits Midas with inventing the Pan pipe. It washis favouring of Marsyas that led to the well known myth of Apollo givingMidas the ears of an ass.Midas is linked with the Mysteries of Dionysus by various myths, suchas his rescue of Silenus, where it is recounted that he recognised him dueto having been initiated. Naturally this connection probably involves syn-cretism, involving the cult of Cybele, with Dionysus identified with a con-sort such as Men (who is depicted with thyrsus wand as well as Phrygiancap in Greek statuary). The identity of the cults in the Greek mind ismore important for our purposes; both are orgiastic cults, celebrating thedivine mother and dynastic hero in the primitive'manner.Orpheus was traditionally said to have been instructed in music andsong by the Muses. These were not the Apollonian Muses of Delphi, butthe archaic Muses of 'backward'Boeotia. Among the many regional vari-ations concerning the Muses these were strongly connected to the cult ofDionysus, especially the form which thrived in Thrace. He enchanted byhis music the beasts, birds and even trees and rocks, which moved frorntheir places to follow the sound, while rivers would cease flowing to stayand listen to him. All nature indeed was charmed by his music, and theNymphs constantly surrounded him.After the Argonautic expedition he returned to Thrace where he mar-ried the Nymph Eurydice, the only one to have won his heart. Their hap-piness was not to last, Aristaus became enamoured of her, and whenshe rejected his amorous overtures he pursued her through the 6elds. Asshe fed she was killed by the bite of a serpent, and such was the love of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Orpheus for her that he followed her shade to the Underworld. The beau-ty of his music was such that it suspended the torments of the damned,and charmed Hades into releasing her soul to accompany him back tothe world of the living. In the best known versions of this adventure he isbidden not to turn around before reaching the surface, on pain of losingher forever, but looks over his shoulder when the journey is nearly com-plete, As Eliade notes, in at least one other version there is no mentionof this failure, and this may refect the earliest tradition. There is a motifof not turning around involved in invocations of Hecate. After leavingan offering at the crossroad, the maker of the offering departs withoutturning around. The person one will see if this is disregarded will be thelJnderworld goddess to whom the offering is made.According to this legend his grief was such that he spurned the Thracianwomen, who in revenge tore him to pieces. This links him to the rites ofBacchus, where the god or an animal representing him is torn to pieces,and these Thracian women are said to have been Bacchantes. This match-es a motif common in the initiatory experiences of shamans, dismember'ment by spirits preceding returning to life as a shaman. After his death theMuses collected the scattered limbs and buried them at Libethra at the footof Mount Olympus. The likelihood is that the Thracian Bacchantes andthe Muses are the same women celebrating different stages of the Mystery.The Thracian women had thrown his head into the river Hebrus, and itemerged into the sea and was borne to Lesbos, still singing. His lyre wasalso said to have been carried there. Both traditions may either representor explain the fact that this island was held to be the home of music onthe lyre. More signifrcantly his head later served as an oracle, in commonwith the skulls of deceased shamans in other cultures. Oracular skullsalso feature in the Greek Magical Papyri. Another account of his deathsays that Zeus slew him with a thunderbolt. This echoes the striking ofinitiates with a thunderstone, as in the Cretan initiation of Pythagoras inthe cave of Zeus."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MusaeusMusaeus was an ancient Greek poet, credited with founding the EleusianMysteries, a son of either Linus or Orpheus said to have lived about t4roncE.

He is also the reputedaurhor of many magical books, in common with Orpheus. Some of theJews, when under Hellenistic infuence, connected Musaeus with Moses.This identification reversed the relationship of Musaeus and Orpheus tomake the latter the pupil of'Moses'. Magical books ascribed to Moses areknown from this time onwards. A similar process to the Jewish use ofthe Sibylline Books, such re-attribution gradually lends the proto-grimoi-res a Solomonic rather than an Orphic background.

Some of them may have been con-fused with one another, but equally likely the confusion indicates region-al variants in a story, and attempts at rationalisation. One such legend,surprisingly perhaps, was given a rationalistic interPretation by RobertGraves. This Phormion lived in a house which had been the home of thefather of the Dioscuri, Tyndareus, in Sparta. He was one day visited bythe Dioscuri in disguise, claiming to be travellers from Cyrene (a city ofLibya). The twins begged to be allowed to stay in the room belonging tohis daughter, which had been theirs in childhood. Phormion gave themaccess to the whole house except that specific room. In the morning hisdaughter and her possessions had vanished, along with the twin gods.

A tug of war resulted as rhe men of Chios andthe Erythraan men both struggled to draw it to their own shore, but nei-ther could prevail. Phormion, who - like Stesichorus - was blind, dreamtthat the Thracian women of F,rythrx., by plaiting their hair into a rope,could draw the image ashore, which they duly did.This resembles a Roman legend where the image of Vesta - connecr-ed with the Samothracian mysteries and the tojan Palladium - wasbrought to Rome. The ship bringing it caught on some rocks and couldnot be moved by the efforts of many strong men. It was brought ashoreby a noblewoman (some call her a Vestal virgin) named Claudia who hadsupposedly been accused of impropriety, she is said to have proved herinnocence by drawing it ashore with her girdle. This is of course not at alltrue; her role in the event was from the first a political one. She was hon-oured by a statue in the vestibule of the temple of Cybele, who's archaicimage - a sacred stone - was the real cargo of the vessel.The descendents of the aforementioned Thracian women alone werepermitted to enter the house where this rope was laid, and Phormionrecovered his sight.

He was reckoned among the seven wise men of Greece(by those who omit Periander from the number). Many details of his lifeappear mythical, but close examination points to a historical ritual con-rexr. Some accounts begin in an unpromising fashion: while attending hisflocks one day he entered c4 caue wbere he fell osleep. According to variousauthorities this sleep endured for 4c , 47 or 57 years. As other accountsmake clear, rhis is a recollection of his initiation into the Cretan mysterycult celebrated in the cave of Zeus on Mount Ida.The modf of a retirement and trance strongly resembles similar retreatsin the careers of Greek seers, poets and wonder workers. While there hefasted and enrered ecstatic srates, which the Greeks referred to as enthusi-astic wisdom (enthusiasm comes from a Greek root meaning inspired bya god). While in this trarLce state he saw the gods and attended to theirwords, which appear to have taken the fonn of speeches. These mightbe compared with the dialogues of various gods which form the laterHermetic literature. The same cave, according to Homer, was visited byKing Minos every eight years in order to hear Zeus declare his law.He is credited with claiming to recall his former life as Aeacos (a rain-maker and healer who became ajudge of Hades), among many other lives.According to Plato in the Laws he foretold the Persian Wars zo yearsbefore the event.

Theimpression people have rcgarding such texts is perhaps partially or whollyderived from attitudes to the scriptures of mainstream religion. In theprevious chapters we have encountered the idea of two or more types ofmagical book. Both of these have something to contribute to the rightunderstanding of these Iatter day magical texts. The first of these is theLiber Spirituum or Book of Spirits, as encountered in our explorationof Cellinis adventures. This species of magical book has enormous im-portance in the history of magical practice. It can be related back to theknowledge Gnostic initiates possessed of the words and seals that grantedaccess to each level of the cosmos, a knowledge which it expresses in tan-gible form. This knowledge itself represents the evolution of an older spe-cies of magical book, the Egyptian Book of Coming Forth by Day.Tbe Liber Spirituum as Comy,rehensive PactIn my commentary on The True Grimoire the central role of the virginparchment in the grimoire genre was explained in relation to the pact. TheLiber Spirituum in which virgin parchment would obviously play a role isno exception; quite the contrary. Such a Book of Spirits is no less than acomprehensive pact, as shown by the agreement of the spirits to the book,which moreover contains their signatures.It is clear that the possession ofsuch a book elevated the magician to a higher level of power and practicethan his counterpart who dealt with individual spirits on an ad hoc ba-sis. No other magical instrument distinguishes levels of attainment in the38"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"same way.Its importance is therefore as central as - and its role is directlycomparable to - the pact as previously delineated. The difference indeedis simply its comprehensive nature, a difference which all but disappears inthe event that a magician using the Wrum method pursues the techniquethrough the entire hierarchy. This course is indeed facilitated by the na-ture of the Wrum method, in which multiple pacrs are an inregral part ofthe procedure.Tbe Fourth Book of occuh Philosopby contains rwo rites for rhe prepara-tion of such a book, and it underwent various transformations thereafter.The Liber Spirituum was usually written and illustrated by the magician.However, during the Bibliothdque Bleue phase of grimoire printing inFrance - to which Wrum belongs - there was an alternative expressionof this idea. According to this interpretation the published grimoire couldbe turned into a Liber Spirituum by having the book signed by LucifugeRofocale, essentially making the flyleaf into a pact. This idea is encoun-tered in owen Davies' Grimoires and explored in a modern context byJohnny Jakobsson in Diabolical. The Bibliothdque Bleue grimoires gen,erally contained portraits of the spirits as well as their sigils and rites.Latterly there has arisen the idea that a special grimoire and the LiberSpirituum are interchangeable, such a grimoire becoming identical to rheLiber Spirituum or Book of Spirits itself,,The famed modern grimoire Liber zjt,with its sigils and names, is animportant example of the closeness of grimoire and Book of Spirits inthe more recent history of magic. The hand drawn originals of the sig-ils in Liber zjr closely resemble the sigils of grimoire manuscripts. Likethe Gnostic and Egyptian forerunners of the idea the spirits of this bookpersonify the stages of a spiritual journey, in this case rhe paths of theQabalistic Tree of Life.More comprehensively significant in relation to the grimoires and tomagical Holy Books in general are rhe orphic books. The right place ofthese books in the history of culture has scarcely begun to be assessed.These books, which began to appear at least as early as the fifth cenruryBcE, were of a revolutionary character.

With the rise of the polis the conditions forthe rise of the individual as differentiated from the collective had beencreated. The Orphic books represent an enormous revolution in humanspirituality arising from this development. The conditions had been cre-ated for private religious associations and for individual interpretation tocompere both with the state cults and with localised traditions, and in-deed to supersede them in importance. The Orphic books are thus thefirst written expressions of a personal relationship with the divine and theworld of spirit semi-independent of - and in competition with - receivedtradition. It cannot be sufficiently underlined that this Literary expressionof spiritual independence is the basis for the entire future development ofthe grimoires.Tlt e Pr ttc tic al Plt ilo s oph er sAcademia has been divided for many decades over the relationship ofthe Hermetic Corpus to the Magical Papyri.

Others argued that there was a High and Low Hermeticcultus, so the one literature pertained to philosophers of the elite, whilethe other was popular; this argument at least places the two within thesame spectrum, if at opposite ends of it. More recently a new perspectivehas emerged, in which the Hermetic Corpus is indeed distinct from themagical papyri,but only in that theory is distinct from praxis. Others havepointed out that the Hermetic Corpus reached Western Europe throughthe interrn ediary of Byzantine manuscripts, and magical elements presentin older originals may have undergone censorship at the hands of laterNeoplatonists; it is certainly noteworthy that theByzantine Neoplatonistscholar Michael Psellus referced to Thrice Great Hermes as a goes or wiz-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"IM}'I-ICATIONS ITOIT MODERN PIIACTI(]Eard: this goes (Hermes Trismegistus) seems to haue had more than a passingacquaintance with holy writ.Interestingly however Psellus also accreditshis knowledge of demonology to instruction by a prophet of Elasonia. Thisprophet had been initiared by Aletus Livius, who had given him a potionand ointment by which he was transformed into a raven and able to flywherever he willed in time and space. This is startlingly reminiscent ofthe legend of Aristea. (6n' cenrury BCE), showing remarkable continuitybetween Byzantine knowledge and the roots of the goetic tradition under-lying the grimoires.The Picatrix was delivered to the West via Arab rather than ByzaLrrineintermediaries. Nevertheless it was undeniably inspired by the sameHellenistic Hermetic philosophy, and developed upon it. In this form arleast the Hermetic legacy contains both theoretical and practical as a con-tinuum.For better or worse much of modern magic, both traditional or of morerecent vintage, is often identified as Hermetic, Whatever shorrcomingsthis classificarion may have it is useful enough, given the practical and the-oretical aspects implicit in the rerm. On the other hand Neoplatonism isevidently a philosophical movemenr of great significance for ancienr mag-ic; its praxis might be exemplified by theTheurgy of Iamblichus. orphismtoo certainly included philosophical strands alongside its practical appli-cation in initiation, necromantic procedures, ritual purifications with aneschatological basis &c. Whether or not the magician identifies with ar-ry,all or none of these philosophies, the need for earthing the mythic strandsimplicit in ancient goetic magic through practical work remains implicit.Perhaps the importance of practical work is less problematic for somereaders than considering magicians as philosophers. Understanding magi-cians as philosophers is not new; arguably the mosr important sourcebookof Western magic is Cornelius Agripp is Three Books oJ occult Philosophy.In the ancient period, as will be shown, some of the more important phi-losophers were viewed as magicians. Empedocles parricularly was respon-sible for such fundamental ideas of magical theory as the four elements.His magic was undoubtedly the practical application of this wisdorn.From this point of view magic can be understood as philosophical praxis."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":")PH IAStephen Flowers in the introduction to his Hermetic Magic provides auseful discussion of the relationship between tbeoreia and praxis in magic.In essence praxis is the implementation of theory, whether that theoryconsists of philosophical systems such as Hermeticism and Neoplatonismor specific concepts such as Sympathia.In the course of this study the origins of goetia are related to the prac-tices of barbarian shamans, Thracian and Scythian. Among the formerwere ascetics whose morality and eschatology appear to have been potentinfuences on Pythagorean and Orphic teachings in Southern Italy andbeyond. On the other hand the religious basis of both these schools canbe traced to cults of Demeter and Dionysus, incorporating Eastern in{lu-ences. The older Dionysian cults on the other hand were ecstatic, provid-ing potent opposing precedents and contrasts with these ascetics. Thesecult aspects of ancient goetia - among other strands to be examined here- provide mythological bases for praxis alongside the purely theoretical.Accordingly when Flowers speaks of praxis vivifying or externalising in-ternal models, it should be clear that while these models involve theo-retical considerations, it is equally important to consider that these havernythic expressions. Magic without theory is a dead letter, a mere recipe;but theory without mythic language cannot be readily transformed intomagical practice. In fact regardless of the particular philosophical model,these mythic expressions constitute a language of archaic goetic practice.Accordingly throughout this text various practical workings are em-phasised. Many of these involve very down to earth procedures closerto Hoodoo than to complex riruals, necromantic conjurations or othersophisticated applications. This kitchen magic is not to be despised onaccount of its seeming simplicity. In each case the ingredients are stronglyassociated with the mythic themes of the study; they range from magnetsand iron to various herbs, olive oil and so on. This magical involvementwith substances and senses reifies the mythic language; time is transcend-ed, through experiential praxis the magician is united with the ancestorsand gods of the tradition."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"' lh e Magic,r,rr,;r;;r;.t tMagical circles have been in use for thousands of years, an importantAssyrian text describes one made frorn a circle of lime (flour is also men-tioned) and incorporating seven sraruerres of winged spirits, apparentlyset before an image of Nergal. The magicians employing this appearto have been priests of the god, and magical work part of their officialrole. This is an imporranr fact considering Nergal's relationship to theGreek Apollo, who in rurn was the tutelary deiry of Orphic magicians.Nevertheless it is very far from being the whole of the srory.An interesting sidelight on magical circles in the grimoire conrext iscontained in the augmenred editions of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft.This anticipates the modern idea that such rituals as the Lesser BanishingRitual of the Pentagram form an imaginary circle; a norion somerimespooh-poohed by so-called traditionalist magicians.

This is the distinction betwe en Magitianson the one hand and the more learned sort oJ conjurers on the other. CIearIythese are seen as two distinct types of practitioner, the magicians arelearned by definition, while conjurers may be but need not be so.This is not the only such case where practitioners who employ grimoiretechniques - with some variations that are unspecified - are divided intoseparate classes.

This resembles insome respecrs the type of snobbery which Atheniar-rs and other'sophis-ticated' Greeks exhibited towards Boeotia and other 'backward' areas,where older traditions were more faithfully preserved. This must serve rorescue us from this interesting tangent to the subject of the magical circleand Greek tradition.Greek religious ritual did not take place in a temple, bur outside it. Themajor type of ritual was an offering or sacrifice; orher aspecrs of rirualsuch as singing were adjuncrs ro this. It was distinguished from normalactivity in various ways, including ablutions and clean garmenrs of rra-ditional style, with further adornments such as a garland of appropriatetwigs on the head. Those attending wenr in procession to the site, just asthe disciples in the Key of Solonton are said to do. Once at the site a circlewas marked out enclosing the place and those taking part, dividing themfrom the mundane world. Sacred objects, including a vessel of water -soon to be used to purify human and animal participanrs - were bornearound its limits. From thence the ritual proceeded ro invocations, prayersand the sacrifice.There is no need here to discuss the cornplexities of sacrifice or otheraspects of ritual, that is done far better than I might do by Walter Burkerrin his Greek\"Rehgion (pages 56 a 58), where I6rst becan-re aware of theabove details in coherent form. What is striking is how this contradictsthe widespread belief that there is, 6rstly, no precedenr for pagan worshipin circles as practiced by modern witches. So too it opposes the notionthat circles in ceremonial magic are limited to the role of excluder of thedemonic, and are solely of a Middle Eastern origin favouring this inter-pretation."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"That is not even their only role in the grimoires, where both circles andtriangles apper in a variety of fonns, positions and roles. A circle enclos-ing a triangle could be marked on the floor, or uPon an altar top for crys-tallomancy. Characters of invocation could be stood uPon or held in thehand (Iamblichus' Theurgy, Dee's Heptarchia); the same designs used formagical circles could serve for portable talismans or pentacles in opera-tions of the same days (compare the Heyttameron and. The Keys of RabbiSolomon,skinner and Rankine'sWritable Key Pagero4,n4 &'c).Some in-srrucrions in Liber TroisiEme (see the spells in The True Grimolre) invoivedrawing a circle around objects, putting things in and manipulating themfrom outside - casting a spell within whilst without. Additionally, magicand the more magical religions were not waiting for Aleister Crowley(Liber fi3 cap 36) or Gerald Gardner (Book of Shadows) to introduce theidea of occupying the same ritual sPace as gods and spirits.In short a circle is not an obsolete symbol of a superstitious fear of spir-its, but an intentio nally created ritual sPace for various PurPoses. It is notalways required for all kinds of ritual work, but neither is it of no value,quite the contrary.

It is only if we permit it thatthe secularised landscape of the modern world is emptied of myth andmagic.

For this book is tobe consecrated, a book of evil $irits, ceremoniously to be composed, intheir name and order: whereunto they binde witb a certain holy Oath, theready and present obedience of tbe tpirit tberein written.This is clear and unequivocal in the presumption rhat such books wereused by magicians employing'evil spiritsi On the other hand the descrip-tion in Lansdowne nq is equally clearrMal<e a small Book containing the Prayers for all tbe Operations, theNames olf the Angels in tbe form of Litanies, their Seals and Charrtfiers;the which being done thou shalt consecrate the sdme unto God and untothe pure Spirits...'

The renor of Lansdownerzo3 throughout is, incidentally, very favourably disposed towards spiritsin general. Even in accounts of potentially hostile Elemental spirits, it as-cribes such hostility to punishing human avarice, rarher than to a suppos-edly demonic narure. This difference aside, parts of this Key of Solomon areplainly infuenced by Agrippa's Occult Philosopby.It also shows familiaritywith the Helttameron (included in E,nglish edirions of the Fourth Book),and later works such as the seventeenth cenrury Magicol Calendar &,c.The method of consecrating the magical book is similar ro rhat describedin the Fourth Book.This is not to say it is reliant on Agrippa, plainly com-parable material was available to him, and this rite may be older thanother material in the manuscript. On the other hand there is substantialevidence that many grimoires drew heavily upon Agrippa, who enabledtheir compositors to at least imitate the magical writings known to him."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"An author whose debt to Agrippa is plain is Francis Barrett, whose monu-mental Celestial Intelligencer compiles materials from the Fourth Book (in-cluding the Heptameron) as well as the Occult Philosophy. Barrett includesthe instructions for compiling the Book of Spirits from the Fourth Book.He also provides an illustration of atypical two page spread devoted to anindividtral spirit. Barrett's illustration is technically correct in every par'ticular; the image of the spirit is drawn on the left hand page, its conjura-tion on the right, along with the magical character or sigil appropriate toit. The image is interesting, and throws light on the apparent differencesbetween the entities of a Book of Spirits as envisaged by rhe Fourtb Bookand Lansdowne 72o3,The spirit depicted is Cassiel, ruler of Saturday; oneof the planetary Angels from the Heptameron.Barrett's illustration showsa frgure riding a dragon, and the figure in question is as scaly as his mount,with clawed fingers and toes. Above and below the image are symbolswhich plainly derive from a plate in the Fourtb Bookentitled The cbaractersof evil Spirits, those labelled Penetrate and Broken.The two characters ac-companying the conjuration on the right hand side are also readily identi-fied. One is a magical symbol found under Saturn in the Heptameron.Theother is a sigil derived from or associated with the square of Saturn. Eachof these squares are associated with three such sigils, one is the Seal ofthe Planet, another that of its Intelligence, which are genenLLy held to bebenign in nature, the other of its spirit which are generally held to be infe-rior or even infernal in nature. The spirit of Saturn associated with thesesigils is named Zazel - one of the most unambiguously demonic of thesespirits - and it is the sigil of Zazel that appears in Barrett's illustration.For Barrett at least then, in accord with the opinion of numerous the-ologians throughout the histo ry of Christian Europe, the Angels of thegrimoires are hard to distinguish from demons. The demons in turn are- by the same opinion - identical with figures in earlier pagan theology,which in the late Classical period were often aligned with the pl.anetaryspheres. As may be readily deduced from the Testament oJ Solomon, magi-cians familiar or contemporary with the Solomonic magic of the z\"d cerptury would also have been familiar with astrological demons. RegardingCassiel in particular it is noteworthy that the Grimoire of Pope I{onorius"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"explicitly identifies this angel as an evil spirit in the a.r\"*d\" n for treas-ures hidden by men or Spirits.The Conjurations of Angels found in the Heyttameron are identical withthose in the Later Goetia of Solomon, which deals exclusively with sup-posed demons. The alleged author of the Heptameron, Piefto de Abano,is denounced as a black magician in the Sacred Magic of Abramelin theMage which is roughly contemporary with Agrippa. Agrippas mentor, rheAbbot tithemius, described the Heptameron as a Clavicle, a title whichfirmly and correctly identifies it as belonging to the Solomonic genre. It isin fact an older text than most of the better known Solomonic grimoires.It may be objected when I wish to draw conclusions from compar-ing some of these texts that they are of widely varying date. However,Barrett was extremely well versed in the older literature, and his usagesare authentic. Lansdowne 1zo3 meanwhile, while plainly pafiLy depend-ent on Agrippa, reproduces features which he portrays as belonging toolder texts with which he was familiar.It is indeed still a matter of disputewhether the Goetia oJ'Solomon is entirely derivative from Reginald Scot'spublication of Weyer in English translation, and Turner's rranslation ofthe Heptameron, or represents to some degree the older text describedby Weyer (my own view is that it is essentially an attempted reconstruc-tion of Weyer's text, drawing on Scot and the Heptatneron translated byTurner). Essentially, in such consciously retrospective works differencesin date can often be comparatively unimportant. Moreover, comparisonswithin the genre are frequently more revealingthan considering texts sep-arately as supposed'things in themselves'. Since the vast majority of suchtexts are compilations to one degree or other, this approach is also morerealistic.Be this as it may, the Book of Spirits as described in Lansdowne 7203,while drawing on the Fourth Book,also involves authentic traditions whichthe Fourth Book does not mention, It is to these connections - central tothis present chapter - that I am about to turn. In the celebrated accountof necromantic practices contained in rhe Life of Benuenuto Cellini, thereis reference to the consecration of a magical book.Judging by the evidencethe evident conclusion is that this book is none orher than a Book of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":")PH IASpirits. Contextually it is plain that this book gives power over spirits,and there is no other book requiring consecration to be found in magi-cal literature. Interestingly, Robert H. Hobart Cust, who edited Cellinisautobiography in I9Io, seems to have been fairly familiar with magical lit-erature. His footnote to the 6rst reference to the book says: Cons atareun libro, i.e. con{tru{t a magic bool< witb which to control {pirits good andeuil. This may indicate that he was familiar with both with the FourthBook, and perhaps with Lansdowne 7203, or with Mathers r8B8 edition ofthe Key, but had not realised the parcial dependence of one on the other.Whether or not he had read these, he was plainly familiar with the idea ofa Book of Spirits, and thus able to identify its consecration as the inten-tion of the necromancer.What remains unexplained is the purpose to which the necromancerwished to put this book, that of obtaining access to the treasures of theearth guarded by spirits. In Cellini's account this purpose is completelyconterminous and convergent with the consecration of the book itself,Now, this might be simply ascribed to avaricious intent. The compre-hensive powers of the spirits involved make this a less than satisfactoryexplanation, since there are individual spirits in several grimoires whoseprovince is the uncovering of treasure. Perhaps then the magician sup-posed that an appeal to Cellini's avarice might make him a more willingaccomplicei This too is unlikely since the magician already plainly knewthat Cellini was desirous of locating a former lover. This was the onlyrequest Cellini rnade of the spirits during two arduous conjurations, anda promise in this regard would have been an obvious incentive. Yet, ratherthan use this as leverage, the magician actually tried to dissuade him fromthe uanity and JoIIy of love affairs.(Incidentally, I disbelieve Arthur Calder-Marshall's suggestion that thenecromancer had a sinister ulterior motive in involving Cellini, intendingto sacrifice him to the devil in Norcia. It is hard to see Cellini, a pugna-cious manslayer with little regard for superior odds, in the role of hap-less victim. All the indications are that these conjurations incited terrorin all concerned, who were - jointly and severally - convinced Catholics,whose acquaintance with 6re and brimstone was an essential part of their"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"UI{F, TILIN'f & TFtE CAVI]upbringing. The most likely explanation for the necromancer'.s interest inCellini was simply thar he had proven himself a brave and trustworrhycompanion in a frightening adventure.)Was there a goetic tradition linking the consecration of the Book ofSpirits and the treasures under the earth? It would appear from Lansdownenq that there was. The instruction for the consecration of the book inLansdowne 1zo3 includes aprayeriAdonai, Elobim, El, Eheieh Asher Eheieh, Prince of Princes, Exi{tence oJExi{tences, haue mercy upon me, and ca{t Thine eyes upon Thy ServantN, r.r,bo inuokes Tbee mo{t devoutedly, and supplicates Tbee by Thy Holydnd tremendous Name Tetragrammaton to be propitious, and to orderThine Angels and Spirits to come and take up their abode in this place; Oye Angels and Spirits of the Stars, O all ye Angels and Elementary Spirits,O all ye Spirits present before tbe Fctce of God, I tbe Minitler and faith-ful Servant oJ'tbe Mo{t Higb conjure ye,Iet God Himself, the Exi{tenceoJ Exi{tences, coryure ye to come and be present at this Operation, I, theSeruant of God, mo{t humbly entreat ye. Amen.Turning from this section of the Solomonic magician's manual to theinstructions on F{ot, to render ThyselJ Mdster of a Treasure possessed bythe Spirits, this exact same prayer is discovered to be a major parr of theritual proceedings. The pruyer is to be made at various points once exca-vations have commenced. Comparisons, even with talismans included inthe same book, show something startling. Whereas these treasure huntingtalismans are geared towards removing magical guards already in place,dismissing them or at least subduing them, this prayer very clearly invitesthe entire spirit hierarchy of the Solomonic universe to take up residence!This distinguishes the rite not only from talismans within the Key ofSolomon itself,, but from a great many other such operarions throughoutthe genre.Cellini s necromancer plainly connected the Book of Spirits with magi-cal treasure hunting, and here is a signifrcant convergence of the two ideasin a Solomonic grimoire. When the two rites are examined it is plain this53"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"is not a case of rnisapplying a ,r\"r\"r';:: .\"\" operation to another con-text. Contextually the prayer is perfectly suited to and integrated withboth operations.The preparation of the Book with this prayer gives power over the com-plete hierarchy of Planetary Angels and Elementary Spirits; representa-tive of the cosmology used throughout the Lansdowne manuscript. Thedescription of the operation involving rreasures also makes explicit men-tion of both Celestial and Elementary spirits:The Earth being inhabited, as I haue before said unto thee, by a greatnumber of Cele{tial Beings and Spirits, wbo by tbeir subtilty and previsionknow the places wherein trelsures are hidden ...We might imagine only one class of the latter type to be directly involvedin guarding subterranean deposits. The grimoire anticiPates this, men-tioning this type, the Gnomes or Earth Elementals, as the immediateguards of the treasure,... it often \\appeneth that those men who undertake a search for tbese saidtreasures dre mole{ted and sontetimes put to deatb by the aJoresaid Spirits,which are called Gnomes; whicb, howeuer, is not done tbrough the Avariceof these said Gnomes, a Spirit being incapable of possessing anything hav'ing no materictl senses wherewith to bring it into use, but because theseSpirits, who are enemies of the passions, are equally so of Avarice, untowhich men are so much inclined...With some allorvances, in the frame of reference assumed by the Grimoireas a whole, everything in the treasure hunting operation is consistent andwell thought out. These allowances consist of two things: the CelestialBeings and Spirits inhabiting the Earth are not clearly distinguished fromthe Gnomes, and it appears unclear whether the Prayer accompanies thestages of the work or its conclusion. The prayer includes the phrase 6epresent in this Operation,so this difficulty really arises from obscure phras-ing, and the other is probably nothing more.

Afterwards they visited the cave, to consult with the Sibyl andenhance their magical knowledge and powers. So rnany came that a localbishop constructed a gallows at the valley entrance to try and dissuadethem, while a fifteenth century document, held in the Historical Archivesof nearby Montemonaco, explicitly refers to such visits from all parts ofEurope, Even the threat of excommunication was insufficient to discour-age these necromantic pilgrimages.Visits for such purposes are portrayed in litenry references; for exam-ple the poet Fazio degli Uberti (d. ry67) wrote of Simon Magus cominghere to dedicate his magical book. Andrea da Barberino wrote a romanceor novel int+og, his hero visits the cave with its half pagan, half devilishSibyl, seeking to hear from her concerning his lost parents. At least oneIiterary figure wrote of a visit made by himself to the area in t+zo; this wasAntoine de La Sale, the tutor of the son of Louis III, King of Sicily andCount of Anjou. He was aware that necromancers visited the lake andthe cave to consecrate their books and acquire magical knowledge fromthe Sibyl. One had come not long before his visit and been violently putto death; apparently not all the locals were friendly to necromancers. LaSale made sure to distinguish himself from such visitors and took withhim on his visit a local doctor and others from nearby Monternonaco.Together on the mountain they heard a loud voice resembling the cry ofa peacock, those accompanying him assured him this voice came from theunderground paradise of the Sibyl. It is striking that the peacock is thebird associated with Juno, arch-goddess of the Romans; as well as withprideful Lucifer, and the god of the much maligned Yezidis.Such visits were apparently not restricted to so-called necromancers,but also to knights and other rypes of rnagician. Whatever their diversity,these visitors were likely not entirely orthodox Christians. The mountainand its cave are comparable to themes widespread at this time in medievalEurope, among heretics with apocryphal scriptures and oral traditions;57"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"those of the Manichean Bogomils for example feature a Cave of teasure,situated on a holy mountain. Through these heretics themes of Iranian,Syriac andJewish Gnosticism also entered Europe. With this mysteriouscave of the heretics, with their Eastern infuences, are associated the woodof the True Cross and the Tree of Life. It is visited by the same Magiwho visited the infant Christ, whose birthplace according to many sourceswas - like that of Zeus - in a cave. From such traditions it is but a shortdistance to Greek and Middle Eastern Mystery cults of the Rornan andHellenisti c era.Aeneas Sylvius, rcferring to a question asked concerning such moun-tains, compared the mountain of the Sibyl with others associated withVenus, the goddess of love, citing Mount Eryx in Sicily and Porto Venerein Liguria. Erotic overtones are frequendy found associated with medievaland later traditions regardingthe Sibyl, as well as a magic that is at oncepagan and Christian. A mid-sixteenth century confession of witchcraftmentions a visit to the cave, and refers to the Sibyl as Donna Venus.Similar themes are to be found in folklore, survivals of pre'Christianbeliefs, such as those involving travellers who visit the interio r of fairymounds. These and other variants on the theme, including the GermanTannhiuser cycIe, may have had no original connection with theAppenine Sibyl. However, with or without her mountain, the enchant-ress was travelling far outside Italy and influencing other traditions. Herspecific combination of the magical and tlre erotic is to be found in anEnglish grimoire transcribed by Reginald Scot in ry8+.In An experimentolf the dead the necromancer first conjures the ghost of a suicide or ex-ecuted criminal; of this spirit he requires {irstly visions in a crystal stone,and secondly that the spirit/e tch me tbe J'airie Sibylid, tbat I may talke withhir visiblie. Once the magician has conjured this shade into the crystal atthe graveside, another operation is performed in a fair chamber, for thesummoning of Sibylia. Rather than a triangle of manifestation, the magi-cian draws a second circle outside his own for this secondary appearancefollowing on the necromantic operation. Somewhat tellingly, the operatoris instructed not only to leave this second circle unmarked by holy names,but not ro cast anie holie thing tberein.

Associated with the erotic,the pagan and the necromantic, it is the cave of Cretan and Phrygian god-desses. Through the heretical and Gnostic traditions which entered me-dieval Europe through Bulgaria, it connects with the grottoes of Mithrasand other Mystery gods. Certainly in desacralised form it becomes a treas-ure cave in folklore and magical tradition. There is however no doubt ofits origins in initiatory cults, where the Cave of Treasure is home to se-crets of wisdom.It is the cave into which prophets and deified kings retire,to emerge with divinely given laws or secrets.Were there medieval and renaissance magicians who saw such a mean-ing in this treasure cave? The answer lies in the relations of magicians,witches and heretics, with each other and with older lore. While thesubject is exceedingly obscure some of the magical literature of the timeshows signs of being written in a twilight language. The ritual from theLansdowne manuscript may well be among them. The time of year givenfor the rite is when the Sun and Moon are in Leo.In Agrippa we find twoscales of the number twelve, one Cabalistic and one Orphic. The iatterfaithfully preserves many features of Roman astrological lore, originallyderived from Hellenistic sources. These features are also known from apchaeology and elsewhere, they are not medieval but Graco-Roman. Leois ruled not by Apollo or Helios, as might be expected.

The treasure cave connects with the lore of peasants andwitches, heretics and magicians.It is no great leap to see adaptations fromheretical lore or pagan survivals underlying some of the twilight languageof the grimoires.In the meantime another obstacle exists. The meanings of many symbolsof the old pagan cults were distorted in the rationalistic interpretations ofmyth and archaic ritual which predominated in the nineteenth century.Such devaluation was not new; Classical authors and Christians alike hadplaced restricted interpretations on the symbols of the Mysteries. Amongthese misunderstood symbols, one of the most significant is the Cave ofthe Mysteries. Many authors in the past have tended to interpret the caveonly as a symbol of the realm of the dead, or of earthly fertility. Now it isof course true that the ancients conceived of a connection between thesetwo concepts, and to this degree there is some residual value in the inter-prerarions which developed in the nineteenth cenrury.Against this however there is the evidence of wider meaning, whichshows how very far reduced the symbol has become when interpreted inthis way. This wider meaning is evident Erstly in the locations of suchcaves. Many such will be encountered in this book, and many more maybe found in the sacred texts and traditions of many periods and peoples.A great many such caves are to be found at the top of a mountain, forexample Mounts Dicte and Ida in Minoan Crete. This is hardly the mostnatural location for a cave whose symbolism was restricted to the subter-ranean realm of the dead and earthly fertiLity,Such caves were associated with initiation and the gaining of wisdom bydivine instruction. This meaning is very apparent in the tradition relatedby Strabo, where King Minos of Crete ascends the mountain to the caveof Zeus, and receives there the tables of law by which his people are ruled.As will be blazingly apparent to many readers there is clear convergenceof this legend with that of the biblical Moses. Neither Zeus nor Jehovahis solely involved with the realm of the dead or with fertility cults, whichfact serves as a useful introduction to the wider significance of the cave."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The cave is not simply a metaphor for the realm of the dead, although itgrants access to that realm among others. Neither is it an allegory for theferdlity of the earth, although again it includes such meaning.

Withinsuch a cave are granted visions of the entire LJniverse, and a complete castof supernatural beings are encountered.This significance was as remote from the understanding of some of theClassical authors as to the nineteenth century rationalists, The descent ofPythagoras or other wise men and initiates into caves was frequently as-sociated exclusively with Hades in Classical times. However, in the Visionof Er, while ^pparendy dead the visionary sees the planetary spheres andsouls descending from the celestial realms as well as ascending from theUnderworld. Nor, notwithstanding changes in how the Underworld wasviewed between Homer and Plato, is this feature of the vision peculiar toPlato's account. Along with the seasonally dying son or abducted daughter,and the fertile Earth Mother of the primitive Mystery cults, are encoun-tered heavenly powers of rain and sun, of thunder and lightning. Eventhe Cretan Earth goddess herself appears to have links with the ancientsky goddesses of ancient Egypt. These too came to be associated with thezodiac,and this symbolism is resumed by the Gnostic Sophia.In the grot-toes of Mithras are encountered a deity comprehending the whole heaven;afigure swathed in the seven coiled serpent of the heavenly spheres, oftenmarked with the zodiacal signs.

Thepowers bestowed by the book are correspondingly comprehensive. Thecoherent and sophisticated concept of the Book of Spirits as a spiritualmethodology lies behind the devalued pact with the devil.

The origin of the word is disputed, as is its language,which may be Greek or Semitic. It may originally have been thename or title of one important personage, extended to represent otherswho shared some important characteristic. As a mythological terrn it iswidely used in the Classical period, while the Sibyls - or the traditionsthey represent - were more ancienr. The Sibyls were associated with spe-cific significant locations in the ancient world, among which Phrygia andits neighbouring states arevery prominent.In the late Classical period theSibyls were considered as holy virgins, resident in caves and grortoes andpossessing the gift of prophecy; connecting them with nymphs such asEgeria, the instructor of King Numa.6+"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Written collections of prophecies ascribed to them were known as theSibylline Books and were regarded as of the highest authority. Both mean-ing and context has changed over time, and the original and subsequentphases all have some relevance to this study. An important second-ary phase derives from the adoption of the Sibyls by ,\"t and 3\"1 centuryChristians, as pagan prophetesses supposedly foretelling the coming ofChrist and Christianity.In this guise they were frequently associated withHermes Trismigestus, and were to inspire Renaissance Hermeticists andmagicians, among others. An additional devalued meaning of fortune-rclIer, or even witch, developed in the late medieval period. This negativeinterpretation was more commonly applied to the Pythoness or Pythia;the Sibyls having been co-opted by the Church while the Pythoness wasseen as wholly pagan.The Sibyls are celebrated in Greek Classical literature, and sdll more soin the Roman period. This literary context - historical as well as mytho-logical - is obscure and contradictory in some respects. It is consistentnevertheless in portraying the Sibyls as historical and important in eaplier phases of religion and culture. Reconstructing the more ancient his-torical conrexr presents some diflrculties. The frrst problem is that in theClassical period the prophetesses associated with Delphi and other cultsites had little independence. While traditionally regarded as virgin bridesof the god, to ensure their chastity, priestesses of Delphi were womenabove marriageable age who were simply dressed as brides.The Pythoness of Delphi in Classical times was controlled by the priest-hood; the Sibyls by contrast are portrayed as independent, Prestigious,and able to travel. According to Strabo there was a Sibyl of Erythrx namedAthenais, in the time of Alexander the Great. The site of an ErythraeanSibyl's dwelling has been excavated, and inscribed utterances discovered.Among them is the Sibyl s claim of a status between men and gods, alongwith caustic comments concerning the priests of Apollo, and even the godhimself,, This supports the literary evidence for a historical backgroundin which the Sibyls, unlike Delphic prophetesses, were not under priestlysupervision but possessed their own authority. This status survived intothe Pan-Hellenic Olympian age of the polis, but was not a product of it.6S"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CttssandraAnother difficulty is the apparent absence of the Sibyl in the works ofHomer, despite traditions that one or more of the Sibyls predated thetojan War, A Homeric characrer who does resemble a Sibyl, and is occa-sionally called one, is the tojan princess Cassandra.In common with theSibyl of Cuma, and the Nymph Daphne whose name is borne by morethan one Sibyl, Cassandra is portrayed as resisting the amorous advancesof Apollo. He grants her the gift of prophecy as an inducemenr, and whenshe wishes to retain her virginity he punishes her by imposing the penaltythat her prophecies, though always true, will never be believed. Anotherconnection of Cassandra with the Sibyls is that she predicted the down-fall of Troy, d.u.e to rhe abducrion of Helen, as did the Sibyl of Marpessa.Another prophecy concerning the fall of Troy is significant in relation toCassandra; this relates to the famous and highly mysterious image knownas the Palladium, a complex marrer which requires further elucidation.The Palladium, according ro some accounrs, was an archaic goddesssculpture. Its feet were not separated, and it stood three cubits in height.Its right hand was raised and held a spear, while in its left was held adistaff and spindle. One tradition has it fall from heaven while a prince isbuilding the citadel of Ilium, which was ro form part of the ciry of T'oy.Another has it fall at Pessinos in Phrygia; still another has Dardanosbring it to the region from Samothrace. Yet another has it made by Abarisfrom the bones of Pelops. There is even a late version that supposes it tohave been a clockwork srarue, but rhis is probably a rationalisation of alegend in which the statue of Athena objects to being sacrilegiously stolen.The Palladium is variously described, and was undoubtedly an im-Portant cult object. It is described as a statue of Pallas, whose identity issimilarly mysterious. In some accounts Pallas is said to have been a giantslain by Athena, who fayed him and wore his skin, and took his name asone of her titles. Another account makes Pallas female, a foster-sister ofAthena whom she accidentally slays during her infancy in Libya. Athenacarves the Palladium in memory of her friend. The name Pallas appearsagain as that of the son of Evander who assists the Trojan Aeneas when"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"he flees to Italy.In Roman legend Aeneas brought the Palladiurn with himfrom Troy; in Roman history a real image was brought from Pessinos inPhrygia, and was guarded by the Vestal Mrgins. As will also appear later,Evander is related to one of the Sibyls, and Aeneas makes a journey to thelJnderworld guided by a Sibyl.Both the Palladium and the Aegis were powerful talismanic objecrs,and the Aegis deserves our attention in this discussion. Mythologicallythe Aegis was made from the skin of Pallas, but is usually said to havebeen the skin of a goat or serpent. The she-goat was the sacrifical animaiof Athena and in ancient ritual the distinction between victim and godwas very slight, thus investing the skin with tremendous power. The Aegistraditionally bore the mask of the Gorgon, a powerful magical symboloften worn by priestesses and goddesses in the archaic period. The goatskin Aegis of Athena as a magical talisman connects powerfully with thePentacle made from the skin of a goat in grimoire ritual. One of the mostancient of these protective Solomonic talismans is the Gorgonian Faceof Shaddai. The origin of the Pentacle is to be sought in sacrificial skinsadorned with mask-like images, subsequently replaced with geometricaldesigns and names of God.Returning to the Palladium, whatever its form and origin, aside fromHomer the tradition was that Troy could not be taken while it residedwith the Trojans. For this reason Odysseus and Diomedes are said tohave stolen it on behalf of the Greeks. It is on the occasion of this sup-posed theft that Athena, displeased with the sacrilege, made the eyes ofthe image flash, and the statue resist capture. According to others theimage never was stolen, but only a duplicate, so that Aeneas was able tobring the real Palladium to Italy. When Troy fell to the Greeks Cassandrawas found in the sanctuary of Athena. Homer, who never mentions thePalladium by name nor alludes to its significance, nevertheless portraysCassandra clutching the image of Athena. That the Palladium was said tohave been made from the bones of Pelops is significant for many reasons.Among these is the fact that after Cassandra was carried offby the victori-ous Greeks she gave birth to a son, whose name was also Pelops.6Z"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Judging from the testimony of ancient writers the Palladium was eithersimilar to or identified with the srone sacred to Cybele, and also a sacredarcefau. - possibly phallic - central ro rhe Mysteries of Samothrace. Itmay be identical also with a beehive-shaped srone called the omphalos,known from Delphi and Delos, which have possible Mesopotamian andEgyptian analogues. That it was sacred and involved in the Mysteries ofa Phrygian or Cretan goddess led to it being interpreted, or even delib-erarcly misrepresented, as an actual starue of a goddess. Various indica-tions suggest it was originally the seat of prophe cy of an enrranced Sibylor Pythoness. Its importance led to various cities and nations claimingto possess it, and to legends accounting for its moving from one place toanother. The likelihood is of course that there was more rhan one, madefrom bone, wood or stone, and with some variation in form.The Clossical SibylsWhen considering the Classical Sybils various ancient aurhors offer di-vergent opinions regarding their number. Plato menrions only one Sibyl,Martianus Capella two, Pliny and Solinus rhree, Pausanias and Aeliangive four while Varro enumerates ren. Varro's lisr has been the mosr in-fluential among later mythographers and classicists, and might appear torepresent a convenienr start point. Against this there is the complexity oftraditions; involving accounts of the same Sibyl moving from one locationto another, or sharing the same name. Varro's listing therefore requiressome judicious handling. The Sibyls he enumerates were associated withten locations, which will here be divided into two groups of five.The most famous Classical Sibyl came from Italian Cuma, which wasoriginally an Ionian Greek colony. Another Sibyl was associated withTiburtis, also in Italy. For our purposes, ir is useful to deal with these twoalongside the Sibyls of Persia, Libya and Delphi. The remaining frve arefrom the region of Phrygia and Ionian Greece: Erythrxainl,ydia; the Isleof Samos; Aeolian Cuma; Marpessa on the Hellespont and Ancyra inPhrygia."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"SIBYLI,INIATbe Sibyt oJ ErytbrcraThis Sibyl from Lydia in Asia Minor is known in Latin as the SibyllaErythrxa.

However, like Sibyls, nymphsalso frequently live in caves and grottoes, A cave on Mount Ida is at once asanctuary of Cybele, the birthplace of Zeus and the site of initiatory ritu-als. Epimenides - who is unlikely to have been a simple shepherd - wassupposed to be tending his sheep, when he entered such a cave. After herbirth she grew very npidly, and began to pronounce oracles in verse. Herparents accordingly dedicated her to Apollo, and she foretold she wouldeventually die from one of his arrows.

Another interpretation follows naturally upon the details he sup-plies: Theodorus was the first man who discovered the working of ironwith 6re. To his ingenuity man also owes the lock, as well as the rule, thelevel and the turning lathe. This description is very reminiscent of theIdaean Dactyls. This Theodorus and the father of the Sibylla Erythraeaare likely to be identical. There is a legend which makes an Ionian ratherthan Libyan prophetess the frrst of the Sibyls. According to this traditionthe father of the 6rst Sibyl is Dardanos, and the mother a sea nymph orNereide named Neso. Dardanos brought the Palladium from Samothraceto Troy, and instituted the Cabiric cult there, and is thought to have beenone of the Cabiri himself.

One of the gates of Hades was there, and Odysseuscame to conjure the dead and consult the shade of Tiresias. According toHomer Cimmeria was placed to the extreme west of Great Ocean.

Curiously, there were three Lamiasin Greek myth, but they do not appear to have been distinct originally.One was the daughter of Poseidon and mother of the Libyan Sibyl byZeus. Another was more monstrous, she was said to steal children andwas thus a terror to nursing mothers, This Lamia was also connectedto Libya, being the daughter of Belus and the Nymph Libya who gaveher name to the country. Reinforcing the connecting links with our firstLamia, this Lamia was also loved by Zeus, but each time she gave birthHera caused the death of the child. In her despair Lamia hid herself in acave and preyed upon the children of mothers more fortunate than her.Hera also afflicted her with sleeplessness, which Zets counter-acted bygiving her the power of removing and replacing her own eyes.Vampiric female spirits that preyed on children took the collectivetitle Lamiae from her.

Various fearuresof these legends suggesr an identity between these figures, including thedwelling in a cave and the removal of the eyes (emblematic of seeing intoanother world). In addition, mythically if not actually, Olympian Apollowas a latecomer to Delphi; formerly it was an Earth oracle, and the deityresiding there was Python, from which the oracular priestesses of Delphitook the name of Pythoness.Lamia as a monstrous female rnay well represent a witch like priestess,and darker aspects of ancient cults lurking behind the sanitized Olympiancultus. As seen earlier, simultaneous religious respecrability and recogni-tion in underground magical traditions did nor entirely elude the Sibylin subsequent periods. Lamia in later lore is associated with such vam-piric figures as Empusa, Gello and Mormo. The origins of Heras mal-ice towards Lamia lay in cultic practice, where such figures personify -so to speak - the negative reflex of Heras role as protecror of mothers,Essentially similar themes are at. work in the cult and myth of Melissa andMedea in Corinth.Tbc Delphic SibylThe Sibyl of Delphi, called the Sibylla Delphica, appears to be relatedto the Sybilla Hellepontica who is alleged to have travelled to Delphi. Arock of the Sibyl, distinct from the omphalos and the oracular chamberof the site, is shown at Delphi. There are rraditions of her competing withthe Pythia. The nymph Daphne, prominent in various traditions concern-ing Apollo, has curious links with her. Daphne is the name Diodorus givesto the daughter of Tiresias, usually named Manto. The seemingly apoc-ryphal theme of earlier dedications of the Oracle involves Daphne, theprophetess when it was sacred to Gaia. In other versions her father is ei-ther: a Thessalian river god named Peneios, or another of Arkadia namedLadon. Both of these were of course highly traditional rural areas, withThessaly in particular being famous for witchcraft. This nymph Apolloloved, and he pursued her withour success.

Described as beloved of Artemis, who as well as beinga virgin huntress herself,, among other things presided over the transitionfrom maiden to wife. This is in part a cautionary tale, of the moral andspiritual dangers of not making the transition.

In this respect, the mythology ofArtemis and associated frgures shares certain features with those of Hera,Z8"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Tbe ltalian SibylsThe Si6yl of Cunr,tThe most famous Sibyl in the Classical period was the Sibyl of kalianCuma, calied the Sibylla Cumana. Cuma was originally a Greek colony,and it was said that Greek colonisation of Cuma predated the TrojanWar; also that a temple of Apollo at Cuma was built by Dadalus whenhe fled from Crete. As at Thesproti a, there is an impressive literary tadi-tion concerning a cave at. Cumx, and physical sites have consequenrly beenmisidentified at both places. In actuality such caves are nor a consisrenrfeature of necromanric sites, and a precinct adjacent to a lake was the morelikely ritual space at both locations. At Heraclea and elsewhere howevera sacred cave was the site of necromantic consultations. Despite this dif-ficulty, there was Greek contacr at Cuma - from at least the Mycenaeanperiod, as shown by pottery finds. Later colonists came from Chalcis andfrom Aeolian Cuma. The Sibyl of Cuma was known by various namesincluding Amalthea, Daphne, Deiphobe, Demo, Demophile, Herophile,Manto and Phemonoe. She had also more barbarous namesr Taraxandraand Melan'kraira. Such barbarous names are possibly untranslatable, butit is interesting that Melane is an ancienr name of samothrace.one n-ryth portrays Apollo as enamoured of her, and offering her any-thing she might ask for. In response she took up a handful of sand andasked for as many years of life as the grains of sand she held, but forgotto include retaining her youth, beauty and health. Apollo granted her re-quest, but she would not yield her virginity even though he offered togrant her perpetual youth, beauty and vigour along with this exrreme lon-gevity. Thus in time she grew old, haggard and melancholy. As she agedshe shrivelled up, coming to resemble a cicada, and was hung up in a cagein the temple of Apollo. When children asked her what she wanted, shereplied that she wished to die. One account reckons her to be the same asthe Sibyl of Erythrx., and that Apollo granted her longevity provided shenever returned there. She lived for a very long time, but one day she re-ceived aletter from the Erythraeans, with a seal made of her native earth."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Upon seeing this she died. However, the usual tradition places her not inthe temple of Apollo but in a cave, where she uttered her prophecies.There is a well known tradition concerning her method of prophecy inthis cave. It was said that she wrote her prophecies upon leaves, and leftthem at the mourh of the cave. Varro indicates that these oracles werewritten in Greek letters and that the leaves were those of the palm tree.Those consulting her lrad to take particular care to gather the leaves be-fore the wind dispersed them and made the message unintelligible. Thistradition itself appears to have been blown around a little, but there maybe a way of rendering it intelligible. There are several references to writingupon leaves in the Magical Papyri and elsewhere. These references fre-quently involve divination, and on occasion the names of gods written onthe leaves appear to be the letters of an alphabet. After particular letterswere drawn by lots, the Sibyl could conduct her oracle by cross referenceof the selected letters to the initials of gods whose names occurred in a setof oracular verses. Some such procedure may explain the tradition that itwas Evander who introduced the Greek alphabet to Italy.8o"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Thc Sibyl of'TihurtisThis Sibyl was named Albunea and called the Sibylla Tiburtina. Shetakes her title from the Italian rown of Tibur, modern Tivoli, abouttwerrty miles north of Rome. According to legend it was built by Tibur(called also Tiburnus and Tiburtus), Coras and Catillus, sons of the seerAmphiaraus. This Sibyl is connected to the Camenae who were propheticnymphs in the religion of ancient Italy. Later traditions suppose them tohave been introduced to Italy from Greek Arcadia and they have beenidentified with the Muses. The most important of these goddesses wasCarmenta or Carmentis, who had a temple ar rhe foor of the CapitolineHill, and altars near a city gate called the Porta Carmenralis. Those tradi-tions that attribute a Greek origin to her cult give her the name Nicosrrare,and rnake her the mother of Evander, with whom she is said to have ar-rived in Italy. According ro rhis tradition she was received by King Faunus(identified with the Arcadian god Pan, he appears to be the patron of ahero oracle here) around sixty years before the tojan War. Evander's fa-ther in this version is said to have been Hermes. An altar to him stood atthe foot of the Aventine Hill in Rome, symmetrical with that of Carmenraat the foot of the Capitol. However Carmenta is older than the Greekcolonisation, her name appears among the Dii Consenres of rhe Sabines,making her status well nigh Olympian in native Italian cults.Her name of Carmenta was supposed to derive from the wildness of herexpression when prophesying, as though carens mentis, without thought.A clearer derivation involves the word carmen, which means a song ortune, a poem, poetry or verse; also proph ecy, or a legal or religious formu-la, literally an incantation. Delivering prophecies in verse was associatedwith Sibyls and other prophers, and the rerm poer had a wider meaningconnected with ecstatic states, prophecy and enchantment.While living she was considered the oracle of the Italian people, and wasdeified after death. This suggests the confusion of traditions concerningthose who officiate in the Mysteries, and the deity served. A festival wascelebrated in her honour on the eleventh ofJanuary. On this occasion shewas entreated to make the women of Rome fertile and grant thern ease inlabour. When invoked as goddess of childbirth she rvas called Prorsa and8r"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Postversa, head first and feet first, being the two positions in which a childcan be born.Carmenta was considered to be same as the goddess Themis of theGreeks.

She presidedover petitions to the gods, and agreements among mortals. In moderntimes she is represented with sword and scales as the goddess ofjustice.When Aeneas came to Italy after the fall of Troy, he was welcomed by theaged Evander. The reason for this welcome is said to be that Evander re-called being the guest of Aeneas'father Anchises. The mother of Anchiseswas also named Themis.Carmenta also received the Greek name of Timandra, sister of Helen,which relates her to the Dioscuri. In other accounts Carmenta is the wifeof Evander, and he is the son of Timandra. Another of her names wasTelpousa, (also given as Thelpusa, Telphusa and even Telphussa). TheArcadian nymph of this name gave her name to a town and a spring; thewaters were so cold that the seer Tiresias died after drinking from them."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Manto, calted the daughter of t,,\",::::]\",,\" catted one of the Sibyls; soshe and Telpousa may originally have been related. Telpousa is said to havetricked Apollo into building his shrine at Delphi, when he had designs onher spring. Later, after slaying Python at Delphi, he avenged himself onTelpousa by erectin g an altar on the cliffs above the waters. This suggesrsthat the Sibyls were older than the cult of olympian Apollo, and thattheir shrines were originally chthonic. Thus at Telpousa there is a templeof Demeter Eleusinia, rhe goddess of the Eleusian Mysteries; dedicated toa Cabiric triad of Demeter, Persephone and Dionysus.Carmenta is also called Tiburtis, who has been cornpared with Telpousa.Two legendary drownings are associated with the river Tiber; rhe deathof Tiresias at Telpousa was more likely from drowning than the temper-ature of the drinking warer. The Greek and Italian myths may rhus berelated in terms of ancient cult, rather than a simple tendency to renderItalian myths in Greek rerms. According ro some accounrs Tiresias hadtwo daughters, Manro and Daphne. Daphne, in common with Telpousaand Carmenta, was said to be a daughter of Ladon; rhis was the name of ariver god of Arcadia, but also the name of the serpenr guarding the applesof the Hesperides in Libya.FcronidAnother ancient Italian goddess, associated like Carmenta with one of thegates of Rome, deserves mention here. This is the goddess Feronia, a majorgoddess of central Iraly. She has another connecrion to Carmenta , apartfrom each being associated with a city gate. Her son is said to have beenErylus, who possessed three separare lives and bodies. This son foughtwith Evander, the son of Carmenta, on his arrival; and was slain by him.Whatever the nature of the relationship between these goddesses, Feroniais interesting for several reasons. She was a goddess, called a nymph, ofwoods, trees and flowers. She possessed several temples in rhe region ofCampania. Custom dictated annual sacrifice ro her, accompanied by afair,at which slaves were set at liberty. For this reason she was identified with83"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"the Roman goddess, Libertas. Intriguingly a symbol of liberty, often car-ried by this goddess, is the Phrygian cap.At her rites, worshippers, as with initiates into Greek Mystery cults,were required to first wash themselves in her sacred fountain, beside hertemple. In addition however, those inspired by her were said to gain theability to transform themselves into wolves and walk over a bed of hotcoals without being burned (attested by Pliny and Strabo). Shape-shiftingand immunity to frre are common features of shamanic cultures, and itis distinctly likely that originally her worshippers were from a mountaintribe. Mount Soracte features prominently in accounts of her cult; inthese accounts, while the names are Greek, the rites plainly retain strongarchaic and indigenous traditions.Feronia had a notable temple at Anxur, now Tarracina, which town wassacred toJupiter Anxyrus. This forrn ofJupiter was represented in numer-ous statues as a beardless boy, reminiscent of the child Zeus in the CretanMysteries. Whether - as has been suggested - this cult connects withthe cult of the Greek god or hero Phoroneus, credited with giving fireto mankind and raising the first temple of Hera, is unknown. However,as appears from Virgilt Aeneid xr.rr.rr53-rr58, Apollo (knowt-t also asPhoebus) had a shrine at the foot of Mount Soracte, which may connecthim with this youthfulJupitenO patron of Soratte's high abodes,Phoebus, the ruling power dmong tbe gods,Whom fr{t we serue; whole w,oods of un{tuous pincAre ft:1led Jor thee, and to thy glory shine.By tbee prote&ed, with our naked soles,Tbrough Jlames unsinged we march treading the kinclled coals.The Apollo of Mount Soracte was simply a classical Greek name for theSabine and Etruscan deity Srlri, known to the Romans as Soranus. Theuse of the Greek name, as in Virgil, does not imply any changes in cult;unlike other Greek imports it appears that no indigenous deity was sup-planted by Apollo, only the name was borrowed. Even Aplu, the Etruscan8+"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"form of Apollo, retained the underworld connecrions of his Eastern ori-gins intacu so too Latin sources refer to Suri as Dis Pater as well as ApolloSoranus. E,astern sun gods generally are known to have underworld con-nections, as for example the Sun-god Ra with his nocrurnal boat journey.This may well explain the frequent connecrions of Helios with chthonicthemes.The shrine of Apollo was in the precinct of Feronia at the footof the mounrain. The Greeks referred to Feronia as Anthesphorus,Philostephanus, and as Persephone to whom these titles belong. That theLatins gave Feronia the title Libertas is also imporranr as the male formLiber is a Latin title of Dionysus. According to Pliny a priesthood drawnfrom the young men of local families performed fire walks at the rites inher precinct, carrying entrails to the altar three times over the glowingembers. These hereditary priests were known as the Hirpi, wolves, or togive them their full title Hirpini Sorani. Strabo links the lupine priests ofSoranus directly with the cult of Feronia, who he calls the underworldmother of wolves, Lupa, the she-wolf. The Romans, recognising that thecontinuation of these important rites required the participation of thelocal tribes, exempted the Hirpini from military service. In earlier timesthey were likely to have been a warrior sociery like the Cureres, and theirchief - the son and lover of Feronia * a wolf king. The solar and under-world associations of Suri are strongly reminiscent of traditions involvinga hero lover and son of a chthonic goddess encounrered elsewhere.Thc Sibyllinc OraclesA very ancient Roman legend concerning a Sibyl has her visit one of thelast Roman kings, before the founding of the Republic. She brought withher nine volumes of prophecies, which she offered him for a very highprice. Upon receiving a refusal she disapp eared, ro rerurn after destroy-ing three volumes. She again asked the same price for the six remaining,only to be refused again. She then destroyed three more and repeated herdemand for the same sum for the last three volumes. The king was asron-85"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ished by this method of bargaining, and on the advice of the college ofaugurs (soothsayers by the flight of birds and other omens) he paid thesum demanded. Thereupon the Sibyl vanished and was never afterwardsseen.These prophecies, which were written in verse, were thereafter carefullypreserved, and known as the Sibylline Wrses, A college of priests knownas the Decemviri (council of ten), and later the Qgindecemviri (council offifteen), was placed in charge of them. In such reverence were they heldby the Romans that they were preserved from public view. They consult-ed with the greatest respect, and only on occasion of great danger to thesrate. The college of priests consulted them with the assistance of Greekslaves, when crisis threatened or when particularly alarming omens wereobserved. Thus they were consulted in consequence of the Latin warsand the invasions of the Gauls and of Hannibal. After such consultationsthere were exceptional sacrifices made to the infernal gods, including inzz6 sc the burying alive of two Greeks and two Gauls.Sacrifices and the introduction of cults, to avert catastrophe, weretypical of the advice given by consultation of the Sibylline books. At theheight of the war with Hannibal this consultation resulted in the bringingof the image of Cybele from her main cult centre at Pessinos in Phrygia.Pessinos was very near to Ancyra, where the Phrygian Sibyl dwelt. Alongwith the image of Cybele the Romans also brought priests from Pessinos,who at this time were likely to have been ethnic Chalybes.Although prominent in myth, the Chalybes are a historic race frequent-ly mentioned by ancient geographers and historians. That the Chalybeswere originally one with the Chaldeans is a frequent supposition of an-cient writers such as Xenophon; as r,vill becom e clear, the reputations ofthe two are linked as well as merely confounded. Their home at this timewas the south shore of the Black Sea. They were - to say the least - great-ly famed iron workers, and the name of King Arthur's sword Ex-calib-erprobably derives from theirs.The result of these arrivals was an upturn in Rome's military fortunes,and a bumper harvest making good the damage done by Hannibal.

A commission was immediately sent to Erythra to gatherwhatever oracles of the Sibyls could be obtained. A rhousand were pre-served up until the time of Augustus, who is said to have consulted them.They were known before the Romans obtained them from the cumaanSibyl or elsewhere. They were 6rsr collected on Mounr Ida in Phrygia, inthe 6'l' century nce, and were attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl. Theywere kept in the temple of Apollo Gergithius, near Aeolian Cuma, (anauthor named Gergitheus wrote concerning the arrival of Aeneas in Italy).This history identifies the Sibyls of both Italian and Aeolian Cuma, aswell as the Sibylla Hellespontica with the Erythraan Sibyl. What becameof these genuine Sibylline verses after Augustus is unknown.

In thisway among others, the Sibyls connecr with Solomonic lore.There are in addition other lesser Sibyls, more folkloric than rheologi-cal.

As is appar-ent in the first of the conjurations, redemptive intervention on behalf ofthe spirit was an incentive to aid the magician. Their relationship is sealedby an oath of mutual assistance, which is to say a pact.In its assumption that the magician has a confederate the ritual showsitself to be completely in accord with Solomonic magical traditions.Interestingly, this fellow has the role of skryec in that he bears a crystaland sees visions in it. For reasons that will shortly become evident, thecrystal is present when the ghost is 6rst conjured.The magician bears ahazel wand, a common requirement of the gri-moires, including Tbe True Grimoire.In my opinion, this is principally adivining instrument though it has properties of conjuration in addition.Necromancy, in which conjuration plays a natural part, is nevertheless ag8"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CONJURINGform of divination as the admonition to the spirit to appear in the crystalclearly shows.Striking the ground three times before the conjuration of the spirit isstrongly reminiscent of the Greek manner of calling upon the god Hades.The spirit receives instructions to obey the magicians will, in particular tofetch Sibylia; the magician swears in return to aid in the ghost's redemp-tion, by offering alms in his name and by prayer. This redemption, dueto the nature of Christian eschatology, does not occur until the Day ofJudgement; in the meantime, the spirit is in the service of the magician.It is particularly interesting that the magician bids the spirit appear inthe form of a twelve -year-oId child. In many traditions, such a child is theideal skryer. This is strongly reminiscent of occasions in the Hellenisticperiod where ritual elements - such as the sacrifice of a bull - undergotransferral from the physical world to the visions seen in scaled down rit-ual (see the Art Armadel in my True Grimoire).The reason for the stone'spresence at this stage now becomes ciear; the spirit is to take up residencein it at this stage of proceedings. The sign that he has done so is a per-ceived change of temperature of the stone; if it becomes hot, he is in it.A constraint to the spirit follows this event, in which he receives in-structions to appear quickly and to be truthful. There is a rehearsal ofthe terms of their agreement when he does so, that he resides in the stoneand remains there until the magician gives him leave otherwise. The formof the spirit is also to be part of this agreement; he is to assume no otherform, particularly of course frightening shapes. Fetching Sibylia, a pa?ticularly important part of his role, is included in these instructions. Itmay be wondered why the magician does not merely conjure her him-self; this is certainly a question that requires answering. The answer isstraighdorward, that the ghost is a resident of this world, while she is ahigh-ranking inhabitant of another. For the magician to seek her in herown realm would be a much more dangerous enterprise. It is more likelythat she would detain him in her world, as Calypso detained Odysseus,than that he would bring her back with him.This stage of the ritual complete, the magician and his confederaterctire from the graveyard to a previously prepared chamber. Two circles"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"GE OSOPH IAare made, one for the magicians, the other for Sibylia ro appear in. This,a striking enough departure from the employment of a Triangle in theGoetia of Solomon, is made more so by the instructions nor ro mark it withany holy names, or place any holy things within it, whereas the trianglein question is rourinely fortified with divine names. The magicians taketheir seats in their circle, with no table; this suggests rhe mode of skryinginvolves looking down into the crystal, resembling the Armadel method.The book mentioned in the rexr can only be the Book of Spirits. A magi-cal breastplate is also part of the ritual appararus; this is a common featureof much magic of the period.The astrological conditions of the ritual are interesting; it is to be short-Iy after the New Moon, the Sun and Moon to be in signs ruled byJupiter,whose hour is that of the ritual. Whatever the meaning of the peculiarterm'Inhabiters' it is clear that it refers to Jupiter; the signs mentionedbeing Cancer, his exaltation, and Sagittarius and Pisces which he rules.The sevenfold repetition of the conjuration is a feature shared with TheTrue Grimoire wirh which these rites have considerable connection. Thisis a bond ro cause the ghost summoned to fetch Sibyl to the circle pre-pared for her, This, so the text assures us, will occur before the seventhrepetition of the conjuration; which I have found to be true also of theprocedure of The True Grimoire. Akhough the appointed task of the ghostis to bring Sibylia forth, this does not obviate the need to conjure her. Inorder to understand this, it is essential to understand correctly the mean-ing of the term conjure. Conjure does not indicare some kind of recitationintended to cause an appearance, but to swear together.Thus even shouldthe ghost cause Sibylia ro appear, she is not under any obligation to col-lude with the magician until after the conjuration with its implicit oath.The conjuration of Sibylia commences with pronouncing of the wordsfrom the breastplate. The breastplate is identical with whar Crowley andothers refer to as the lamen. The words and symbols inscribed upon agiven lamen are cenrral to the particular work in hand. It is presumablyfor this reason that they take first place in the conjuration that follows.In many ways, the critical element of this operarion is the apparentlybizarce demand for sex favours in the penultimate line of the conjuration."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"CONJUI{ING THE SIBYI,SAs seen earlieL the sexualised Sibyls emerged in the medieval period, ifnot before, being identified with the Queen of Sheba and with Venus.This is considerably more than a disapproving theological association ofsexuality and paganism. Nor is sexual gratification the only role of theSibyl; in the context of thejourney to Norcia she is clearly an initiator.Inthis light, her sexuality takes on a quite different aspecr.It is in fact criticalto the apotheosis of the magician. An examinarion of the precursors ofthis powerful theme must await a subsequenr parr of this study.As in The True Grimoire Sibylia an offering of frankincense attends theappearance of Sibylia. A bond of the spirit follows, in which the magicianmakes known his requirements, that she offer him good counsel, makemanifest hidden treasures and all other things that he might desire ofher. In this respect Sibylia is treated much as any other spirit in conven-tional demonolo gf, even though it is clear enough that she is far more.Nevertheless, the association with treasure hunting connects readily withdeeper themes that we have explored elsewhere. It is obviously significantthat the process that immediately follows in the'sibylian part of Scot'stext concerns magical treasure hunts. This underlines, if you will, the con-nection of these themes.In the meantime it should be mentioned that thebond of the spirit here is also a special form of License to Depart. Thisis not a conclusion but a temporary pating, until the magician calls heragain. This he will do, as this is evidently but the beginning of their rela-tionship and work together.The status of the Sibyl appears lessened in the context of this rite, com-pared to her position in the Norcian legends. Among the details that haveapparently diminished is her ability ro consecrate and confirm the powerof the Book of Spirits, which nevertheless plays a significanr parr in theritual. Nevertheless, the rite retains some very significant details. Of these,the sexual nature of the magicians relationship with her is certainly one.Implicit too in her ability to act as counsellor is a far hlgher srarus rhanthat of a simple divining spirit. This reminds us that the Sibyl encoun-tered in the mountains of Italy was an instructor in magic, whose author-ity exceeded that of the magician. This is a most porent indicator of heroriginal role in older traditions."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Cha7tter X: To know oJ treasure hidden in the earthWrite in paper these charaCters following, on the Saturday, in the hourof Moon, andlay it where rhou thinke$t rreasure to be: if there be any,the paper will burn, else not.

Another point made by the above aurhor, and elaborared here, is"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"that the history of such spells derives from high antiquity. I quote herethe relevanr passage from Plat o's Republlc, Book II, in the translation byBenjaminJowettrAccording to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service ofthe king of Lydia; there was a great Storm, and an earthquake madean opening in rhe earrh ar rhe place where he was feeding his flock.Amazed at the sight, he descended into rhe opening, where, amongother marvels, he beheld a hollow 5razenhorse, having doors, at whichhe Stooping and looking in saw a dead body of ftature, as appeared rohim, more rhan human, and having norhing on bur a gold ring; this hetook from the finger of rhe dead and reascended. Now the shepherdsmet together, according to cudtom, thar they might send their monthlyreport about the flocks to rhe king; into rheir assembly he came havingthe ring on his frnger, and as he was sirting among rhem he chanced toturn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when inftantly he becameinvisible to the reft of rhe cornpany and they began ro Seak of l-rimas if he were no longer present. He was a$tonished at this, and againtouching rhe ring he rurned the coller outwards and reappeared; hemade several trials of the ring, and always wirh the same resulr - whenhe rurned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards hereappeared. Whereupon he contrived ro be chosen one of rhe mes-sengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived heseduced the queen, and with her help confpired again$t the king andslew him, and rook rhe kingdom.A variant of this story appears in Herodotus, who in rurn received itfrom the Satires of Archilochus. The identification of Gyges as a shep-herd is fairly obviously a convention which recurs in regard ro severalcharacters in this study; in historic aI reality he was a Lydian noblemanjust as Epimenides was a high ranking priest and so on, So srrong are thefolkloric themes surrounding Gyges that the likelihood is that the leg-end represents an accumulation of religious traditions around a histori-cal character.

The descent into the earth is not dissimilar from the cave themeinvolving other mythic shepherd kings and priests, and the inhumationof a body more than human might be compared with the mysteries of thebirth and death of Dionysus or of Zeus in Crete. As an underworld jour-ney the myth has parallels in the accounts of Greek gods. Hades king ofthe Underworld possessed a helmet of invisibility, frequently seen wornby Hermes as guide of souls. It has also been suggested that Hades andHermes Kthonios are older and younger forms of the same god.In this regard it is important to note that the ritual is preceded by atalisman for treasure hunting, which I have already connected with theCave of the Mysteries, in fact the two rituals form the whole contentsof the chapter in question. Lydia itself is of course the home of a Sibylas described earlier, as well as recurring several times in connection withThracian and Phrygian mysteries throughout the volume. The rite thusbrings us more or less full circle from Mystery religions, ancient Lydia andits Sibyl to a conjuration of Sibylline fairies in Renaissance England.

This date is very close to All Hallowsr when the Sun isin Scorpio (the Zodiac sign corresponding to the eighth house, the houseof death).In England and elsewhere national commemorations take placeat the Cenotaph, this is very similar to a form of hero shrine in ancientGreece (distinct from a tomb or mound in that the body is absent, whichis not to say the spirit or spirirs have no connecrion with the place). Localwar memorials often have the exact form of this monumenr, and bear thesame title.More striking still is the symbolism of the poppy - the flower ofPersephone - used in wreaths and worn singly. These are also often placedon the graves of servicemen by relatives, as well as at monuments.Noted spiritualist Wellesley Tudor Pole had a good deal to do with theformulation of this commemoration, as well as his better known involve-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAment with the founding of Glastonbury as a modern New Age centre.These ceremonies and their symbols have strong classical precedents fornecromantic work.

The ability to prophecy, often through ecsraric srares,was originally a power associated with the archaic goetes and their successors.Lucian (died r8o cE) and Plutarch (died r4o cE) linked the term goetaswith apatonas, meaning cheats.

Neither rerm wasoriginally derogatory, though both have sufllered historical devaluation;rather more in the case of goeria.

It remains for occultists such as myself todelineate what these findings imply for the history and development ofWestern magic, and the possible significance of goetia ro posr-modernmagic. The academic world has performed a signal service by establishingthat the term goetia has a very long and chequered history, the origin ofwhich lays in the ancient Greek word, goen or goeten.One important find-ing that has emerged is that this root refers nor ro the arts practiced, butto the individual practicing them. It is from the goen that such arts taketheir nam e, rather than the other way roundi goetia is what a goen does.The original identity of this individual is thus more critical than any sec-ondary de{inition of the arts associated with them.

The goen wasone who performs a lament in the funerary rites of early Greek religion.Eustathius, a highly esteemed Greek commenraror on Homer flourishingat Constantinople inuTo ce, derives goen fromgoos: to moan, a mournfulsound.

On the con-trary, the arts of the goeten were performed openly on behalf of the com-munity. Later on the term came to be loosely interchangeable with others,such as the pharmacoi who took their name from the drugs employed, andso on.

It is not the arts practiced that de6nethe goeten and their abilities, but personal inner resources (what might betermed their goet-ness'or goet-hood'). This is only to be expected from aphase of culture wherein magic is not perceived as a specialised or margin-alizedsphere of activity,but permeates the whole of existence.In literary sources this lamenting magician was also called a psychogogeor guide of souls, a term which had the additional meaning of necroman-cer. In the play The Persians,by Aeschylus (died 456 scn), the works ofthe psychogoge and the magical effects inherent in the act of lamenting(gooin) are usefully portrayed.

Senior Persian nobles wished to consult the formerEmperor's shade, since he was assumed to have foreknowledge of what wasto follow. Cicero in his work On Diuination rcmarked thatr none among thePersians did enjoy tbe Kingdom but be that bad fr{t learned magic.In realityeven though Aeschylus' play portrays the Persians as adept in magic, bycomparison with other evidence it is certain that the rites portrayed rep-resent Greek beliefs and customs, wherever they may have obtained them.It also cannot be overlooked that the ritual is performed by nobles; ofthe family and peer group of the deceased. This equates with the evoca-tion performed by Odysseus in the eleventh chapter of the Odyssey, andis by no means unique. Among the Greeks and other narions, soothsayersand other skilled individuals rourinely accompanied milicary expeditions.They were of the same social class as the chiefs and their staff, and oftenled contingents of their own. In addition, in Greece and Persia alike, aris-tocrats and rulers officiated in rituals of state, of temples and of the palace.These rites involved special knowledge as well as particular status.While valuable it is a fact that the literary evidence tells us comparative-ly little about magical specialists. All the same, it is clear that the beliefssuch arts represented were common to the culture as a whole. An exten-sive comparison of the sources also provides many valuable details, nomatter how complex and varied they might be. There are great complexi-ties in unravelling the social status of various strands of magical practice.To a degree however Aeschylus and others simply show us that such ritesand practices formed part of the overall culture.Bearing in mind that the rites of mourning were seen as possessing thepower of evocation, it is also a known fact that mourners could be hired.Certain backgrounds could also recommend particular individuals for therole, such as Mysian origin. There is also no doubt that full-time special-ists in evocation existed (on the staffof a necromanteion for example).Such rites and such magicians had the power to guide souls to the un-derworld, and to summon them at need to the world of the living.Indeed,they formed a bridge between the worlds in their own person. Such aguide of souls was personified by the god Hermes, who became a pre-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"eminent deity of magicians. He was able to travel vast distances at speed,and to visit and return from the Underworld.In Classical times there wasa sacrifice to honour the dead the day after their demise; a further rite wasofFered to Hermes a month later.Plato often speaks scathingly of such practices, describing the officiantsas mendicant prophets. In the Symposium when speaking of the power ofthe Daimon called Love, who is intermediate between gods and men, hesays: in him all is bound together, and through bim the arts of tbe prophetand tbe priest, their sacrrfces and mysteries and cbarms, and all, prophecyand incantation fthe word used is goetia), fnd their way.From these refer'ences it is plain that very often those he speaks of as goen were priests ofpermitted religions. This included both wandering priests connected tothe Orphic tradition, and those of temples and oracles in general. He saysof them that they: go to rich nten's doors and persuade them that they havea power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for d man'sown or his ance{tor's sins by sacrrfces or charms, with rejoicings and fea{ts.Also that: they promise to harm an enemy, whether ju{t or unlu{t, at a smdllco{t; with magic arts and incantationsbindingheauen, as tbey say, to executetheir will.There are striking resemblances in his language to what was later saidof medieval and Renaissance magicians, of whom many were priests.

One has only to alter the namesof the purarive authors to put this in the mouths of later critics of whatCornelius Agrippa called Goetians and Necromancers with their booksof Solomon, Enoch and so forth. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting thatthe grimoires called Books of Moses were originally inspired by Books ofMusaus.In what appears to be a reference to Epimenides and others he addsthar they: persuade not only individuals, but whole cities, that expiations andatotrements for sin may be mode by sacrtfce.s, by magicians who are equallyat the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort lof ritual] tbey callIilysteries.The dead were refened to as Demeter's yteople, and the Mysteriesof Eleusis were in honour of Demeter. From Plato's critique, along withrz8"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"archaeological and other evidence, a clear picture emerges, Despite an on-going process of devaluation in the Classical period, the goen and the nec-romantic arts were initially a respectable part of archaic religion. With orwithout the approval of Plato and supposedly rational philosophy, manyaspects of this archaic religious magic continued throughout the Ciassicalperiod. Indeed they survived into the Christian era. Eventually it wasto be perpetuated, at least in paft, by elements of the Christian clergy,This was the clerical underground who composed the grimoires, adapt-ingByzantine and Arab texts based on Graco-Roman models to a moreacceptable theology.A clear and solid fact emerges from the complex and incomplete evi-dence available. The most spectacular aspect of the activities of the goetenwas associated with the dead. The association of goetia with necromancyhas been a consistent part of its identity, long after its ancient origins wereforgotten. In ancient times - as now - rites for the dead were an essentialaspect of religion. The role of the lamenting priest in relation to death hadseveral aspects. One of these involved guiding the soul of the departed tothe underworld. This served the purpose of ensuring their safe arrival inthe afterlife. On the other hand a spirit for whorn such rites had not beenperformed was all too likely to return seeking revenge. This is CorneliusAgrippa's meaning when he says:... the Ancients ordained expiations of Carcasses, that that which wasunclean might be fprinkled with holy water, perfumed with incense, beconjured with sacred orations, have lights set by, as long as it was aboveground, and then at length be buried in a holy place. Hence Elpenor inHomer: I beseech thee (saith he) Ulysses, be mindful oJ me, and leave menot unburied; le{t being unburied I become an objett of tbe Gods wrath.Dependent on circumstances the repertoire of the goen included two op-tionsr cure or prevention. Thus the laying of ghosts was a natural exten-sion of their role; as also the prevention of such an eventuality in specialcircumstances. These circumstances include deaths at sea, or in distantplaces.

His pres-ence in the narrative may represent avariant tradition in which Elpenorrather than Tiresias was the guide or inrerme diary,The role of the lamenting priests, and beliefs and practices concern-ing them, can be traced back into the archaic period of Greek religion.Excavations at one Mycenaean shaft-grave at Dendra revealed no humanremains. In their place was a sacrificial altar complete with knife. Besidesthis were found a hearth and three sacrificial pits. In one of these pitsanimal bones were discovered. Most impressive of all were two monoliths,each shaped to resemble a human outline. These appear to have servedeither as surrogates for the absent deceased, or possibly a habitation forthem during the rites performed here.In other Mycenaean tombs, where burials had taken place, were foundpits never used for burials but for burnt offerings. Into these would havebeen poured blood from sacrifices, also other libations, of wine, honeyand milk. Nor did these ofFerings cease with the burial. The evidence forsubsequent offerings is strong in excavared Mycenaean burials, includ-ing sacrificial pits sited over graves, and animal bones at the entrances oftombs. Deducing from the practices of larcr Greek religion, such offeringstook place on the third, ninth and thirtieth days after death, and there-after each succeeding year. Such rites were of course intended to honourthe dead, but also to appease and consult them. The discovery of porreryin Mycenaean graves which dates from the later Classical and Hellenisricperiods is significant physical evidence of long enduring hero cults.It cannot be certainly stated that these cults were continuous; reviv-als may have been inspired - somewhat ironically - by the prestige ofHomeric heroes in later times. Such caution is important ro a reconsrruc-tion of Greek history. It is clear roo rhar originally rhe Mycenean tombcults were family cults, whereas the later hero cults were associated withcities and shared by the general population. This aside, it has become clearas archaeology has proceeded that the Classical Greeks were rhe heirs of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"the Mycenaean past, just as early modern Western culture was the heirof Classical Greece. Also, whether continuous or revived, the importantplace of the cult of the dead is a vital element of this study.It has enormousimportance to the history of goetia, from the Greeks to the grimoires. Thefunerary and necromantic rituals performed by Odysseus in both the Iliadand Odyssey clearly have connections with Mycenean practice, and that inthe Odyssey was also a model for later necromantic practice, regardless ofthe changes from one cultural era to the next. Regardless, in particular- to anticipate ourselves a little - of where exactly the Underworld wasfrom one era to the next.I{o*r, and the Magical TraditionMeanwhile, traces of authentic Mycen aean practices are to be found inHomer's epics, with important omissions. There are distinct diffrcultiesin relying on Homer. For example, it is notable that the burial rites of theGreeks in Homer are performed by comrades and family. The one andonly occasion where we meet dirge-singers participating in funerary ritesis the funeral of F{ector, champion of the Trojans, a detail Homer swiftlypasses oret (Iliad z4:7zt).In the Odyssey, Odysseus and his men are forced to fee the land of theCicones after a frght by the ships, without proper burial rites being per-formed for the slain. Before sailing away a lament and three ritual criesare made for each man lost (Odyttey 9:65-6). Such also was the customat Later Greek funerals, to invoke the name of the departed three times.The custom is referred to in Aristophanes comedy Tbe Frogs.In this playBacchus disguises himself as Heracles in order to travel to the under-world. The purpose of his disguise is that I-{eracles had gone there and- more importantly - returned.When Odysseus and his men are portrayed as first raiding Ismarus, cityof the Cicones, it is as legitimate enemies on account of their support forTroy. Against Odysseus'advice his men stay and feast on looted livestock,and their enemies have time to summon fi,ercer allies and counter attack.There is, apparently, nothing particularly mysterious about the encounter."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Contrast this with the non-Homeric epic traditions concerning theArgonauts, depicting a period which Homer and later tradition saw asonly a generation before the tojan War.

Homer, the author of the supreme epic poetry of the Greeks,who some traditions saw as a descendent of orpheus, does nor so much asmention it. This may be due to the later ^ppearance of the Orphic reformsof the Dionysian religion. Equally however, the limited role of Dionysusin the Homeric epics may have a good deal more to do with Homer's at-titudes - and those of a purely aristocratic epic - than the contemporarystatus of Dionysus.Also omitted by Homer is any menrion of the common practice of seek-ing prophetic dreams at temples, oracles and necromanteia (oracles of thedead), termed incubation or oneiromancy.

Indeed, Greek philosophy has many irrational elemenrs,and some of its key figures can be linked to the very traditions discussed"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"in this volume. The fall in status of the goen has irs roors in the rise ofHomeric Olympian religion and the decline of the old clan culture. Theseroots are co-emergent with the rise of the city, or to use irs Greek name,the polis; though, paradoxically, goetia first appears in the literary recordsimultaneously with this urban experience. This point is the dividing linebetween historical goetia and such predecessors as historiography can dis-cern.In the city the collective identity of earlier times was eroded by rhe riseof a new collective of individuals, its religion administered by officials andfunctionaries rather than family members, be they Pelasgians or females.The new culture of the polis and the traditional world outside it and with-in it were to confict dramatically. The social fabric faced problems whichwere to become critical, problems with which the genius of Plato srrug-gled without success. There were contradictions, in that the humanist in-dividualism made possible by the polis was largely the preserve of malecitizens, in a society which depended on a near equivalent population ofslaves. There was also a problem and a contradiction for the magician.The goen was, from the beginning, an individual and a non-conformistdistinguished from the collective by unusual talents. In primitive'societythese talents were useful to the collective, and the individualistic magicianwas a respectable figure. With the rise of urban individualism organisedinto a community in the new social model, the first individual - the goen- increasingly became a marginalized figure.Did the devaluation of goetia commence in the identification of thegoen as a threat to the new status quo? Probably not, though ir is pos-sible to get this impression from Plato. In reality however many of Plato'sbarbs at magicians are actually aimed at religious and political targets.Inother words many such attacks are not aimed at marginal figures, but thestatus quo itself. Certainly this involved a critique of superstition, andthere was a divide between the old beliefs and the sophistication of theGreek city state. That there were itinerant magicians is undoubted, andPlato used negative descriptions of these magicians to criticise other tar-gets. Disregarding the purely political aspecr, it cannot be ignored thatsome of these critiques involved the magical side of established religion."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The goen had been a central figure in this religious framework, and manythemes related to goetia were still central. Indeed the very itinerant magi-cians of whom Plato speaks were religious figures. Unpopular with someof the aristocratic intelligentsia, they were nevertheless an authentic partof Greek religious life.All this complicates rhe task of drawing conclusions from Plato, and in-deed classical literature generally. Platos writings do not represenr a causeof magic! declining status, but a response to such causes. There was afar more important causal literary contribution to the cultural divide thatwas ultimately to marginaLize the magician; and it was nor Platonic butHomeric.The changes that produced this diminurion primarily involved the be-liefs of the past, where magic and religion had been indistinguishable. Itappears obvious to consider ancient religion as concerning the gods, whichsuggests changes in portrayal of the gods is of primary concern. The godscertainly play aprominent part in Homer's epics, and in large degree rheyhave been utterly transformed from their older selves. Homer, himself anaristocratic product of city state culture, projected his world back uponthe old gods. In the process the gods become more human and civilised,and far less other. Through his tremendous influence, and the transfor-mations in society represented by the polis, the gods increasingly becamedetached from the context of traditional rites and beliefs. The primitiveelements of magical religion began to lose their meaning in consequence.That this was avery gradual process does not diminish the role of Homeras a causal infuence.Homer's influence had a still greater impact upon anorher aspecr of t:ra-ditional beliefl While Homer's gods remained larger rhan life, the mighrydead were infinitely reduced. This impact is all the more ironic since inhis works, while the gods appear on almost every page, the mighty deadappear in almost every senrence. They are the heroes; portrayed in life aspowerful, tagic, majestic and above all human, but in death as powerlessand pitiable. Yet in Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion the dead herowas a far ftompathetic figure. On the conrrary, in mainland Greek culture- and often outside it - they were worshipped, and often consulted at"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"oracular shrines. With interruptions and transformations, hero cults canbe identified from at least the late Bronze Age, through the Classical era,into Hellenistic and Roman times.The subject of this work is of cours e goetia, nor Homer or rhe evolu-tion of Classical civilisation. Even so, it is important to be aware that heomitted or under-stated many aspecrs of Greek religion, which remainedstrong despite his huge infuence. Hesiod, anear conremporary of Homer,and of almost equivalent srarus, portrays the heroes quite differently. Hecalls them demi-gods; a title they retained centuries later in the writingsof the Theurgists. As demi-gods, often in otherworldly serpenr form, theheroes were possessed of more than human knowledge and power. Theirpower was not decreased by death, but greatly enhanced.The new Olympian religion of Homer contained, in essence, rhe seedsof its own destrucrion; as also that of the traditions it sought to absorbor supplant. The humanising of the gods was to have powerful long termconsequences even upon the ciry srare sociery rhar produced it. The dimi-nution of the dead had a much more direct impact. This, perhaps morethan anything else, was to subvert the position of the goeni and was amajor cause of the devaluation of goetia. The magical elements withinGreek religion had suffered a powerful blow, and without magic it lackedthe power required to give it meaning.In direct consequence of these changes there were imporranr philo-sophical efforts to restore meaning to religion, even to recover magic.There were efforts to transform and reinte grate the fractured Classicalworld: Pythagoras and his infuential school; Plato and his successors,the Neoplatonists and Theurgists, endeavoured or aspired to do just that.There were also responses to the crisis within Classical society that weremore geared to the resulting needs of individuals and groups. Both willnecessarily play a secondary part in this study; the central and primarypurpose of which is to reveal the goen. This requires an examination ofthe magic that preceded these changes, and which survived long afterthem.

Integratedwith these is a discussion of Homeric and Classical necromancy.GOETIC GALLERY:NEC ROMANT I AAescosAeacos is an extremely ancienr figure of Greek tradition, predating thecomposition of the Homeric epics.In Classical mythology he was the sonof Zeus by the Nymph Aegina, the daughter of the river god Asopus. Hewas king of the island of Oenopia which he called after his mother's name,and the grandfather of gre^t Achilles. He saved Athens and all Greecefrom a most severe drought; sent by the gods in anger at a murder com-mitted by Pelops. In the Classical account of this miracle Aeacos savedGreece by climbing a mountain and praying to Zeus. Graves suggesrsthe actual method more likely resembled that described in the Accountof Marvellous Things of Antigonus of Carystus, involving a sacred chari-ot bearing brazen vessels that clanged and spilt water. Orher traditionalrainrnaking methods included rattling pebbles in a gourd and use of abullroarer; another, involving dancing and the beating of shields, is remi-niscent of the Corybantes. These, guardians of the infant thunder-god,besides being mythological figures were also personified by Phrygian andCretan ritualists. He also magically re-peopled the island of Aegina afterits desolation by a pesrilence, this he achieved by interceding with Zeuswho transformed the ants in an old oak rree into men (the Myrmidons).Others say the island was uninhabited ar his birth, and was then popu-lated miraculously in that manner. Such was his integrity,renowned as hewas for his justice and piety throughour Greece, that after his death hebecame one of the threejudges of the Underworld, and keeper of the gateof Hades.

Thereis no need to detail his role in all of these, especially as orher factors inhis identity deserve more attention. Before moving on ro Tiresias horv-ever, it is necessary to look at his mysterious ancesrry. Seemingly little isknown of his reputed father Everes; while his mother is a far more sub-stantial character. Her name was Chariclo, a Nymph as one might expecr,whose interesting myth also connects several themes relating to this stud1,.At first glance Greek myth appears to know of more than one Chariclo.However, these are not as separate as appears, various traditions connectthem all. This circumstance may casr some light on rhe apparent anonym-ity of the father of Tiresias.One Chariclo is said by some to be a daughter of Apollo, and by othersto be the daughter of Oceanus. These accounts agree that this Chariclowas the wife of the centaur Chiron (strictly the transliteration should beCheiron, meaning hand). Chiron was an immortal, and while mosr of rheCentaurs were dangerous and savage, he and anorher named Pholos werefriendly, hospitable and wise. A common feature in rhe history of manymajor heroes, including Achilles andJason, is being raised by Chiron.Another Chariclo was the daughter of Cychreus; his srory also involvescontradictory elements. In one he slays a serpent which was ravaging theisland of Salamis, and was rewarded with rhe throne. In the other he rearsthe serpent by hand, and it is later driven to Eleusis. This was rhe homeof the Mysteries of Demeter, and there the serpent became an attendantof the goddess. A serpent was in fact among the sacred objects involvedin the rites. At a famous naval victory off Salamis a great serpenr wasseen among the Greek ships. The Delphic oracle subsequently idendfiedr37"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"this serpent as Cychreus himself. If not a god originaLly, Cychreus wascertainly a deified hero; this story implies that like others he possessed aserpent form, which was likely to have been oracular.The daughter of Cychreus married another ambiguous character,named Sciron (note the resemblance to Chiron). Sciron is portrayed asa monstrous villain in the legend of Theseus. A quite different story atMegara was that he was the kindly husband of Chariclo. She bore him adauglrter, Endeis, who in turn married the irnportant figure Aeacos (forwhom see above). They in turn produced Telamon, who became male heirto Cychreus, and also - it almost goes without saying - an Argonaut.Another Chariclo, identified by some with the first but perhaps thesame as both the above, is portrayed as the favourite attendant of Athena.Before turning to her, and returning to Tiresias, consider the detail in-volved in the account briefly outlined above. There is a good deal morefor each and every character named: who ruled where, how they feature inother stories, and so on. Yet Everes the supposed father of Tiresias, a sonwho is encountered in very numerous myths, seemingly appears in noneof them.Returning now to Tiresias, he lived to a great age, seven or nine genera'tions; and was also blind. How he came to live so long and why he wasblind is explained by two stories which will follow in their place. There isa Mount Cyllene in Arcadia where it is said Hermes was born, as a childTiresias was on top of this mountain when he saw two inter-twined ser-pents. On trying to separate them with a stick, he suddenly found himselftransformed into a girl. Returning there seven years later he again sawthe serpents twining together, and attempting to separate them again heregained his former sex. The alert reader will suspect that the staff andserpents connect with the caduceus of Hermes, on whose birthplace theseevents occurred.In the meantime Tiresias had been married. He received a visit afterreturning to his original gender, from Zeus and Hera, King and Queenof Olympus. The gods had been disputing whether men or women expe-rienced more pleasure from sex, Since Tiresias was the only person whocould possibly know, they put the matter to him. Tiresias answered that ifr38"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"the enjoymenr berween them were divided in ten, rhe woman would pos-sess nine of them. This reply delighted Zeus, and infuriated Hera, whostruck him blind. Zeus, to mirigate this harsh punishment, granred himlife to seven generations and the gift of prophecy. Such, in any case, is thestory according to Ovid and orhers. It is an amusingtale, but lacks cred-ibility as a genuine myth.This story is fatly rejected by Apollodorus, Callimachus and orhers,who give a more interesting explanation of his blindness. The mountainin this story is Mount Helicon, the original home of the Muses beforethey became civilised and moved to Delphi. Arhena was bathing there,accompanied by Chariclo, when Tiresias accidentally laid eyes on her di-vine forrn unclothed. Kronos, the former king of the gods, had laid downblindness as the punishmenr for mortals who looked upon naked god-desses uninvited. Athena accordingiy blinded Tiresias, to the protests ofChariclo, his mother.Athena is generally a friend ro heroes, and there is nothing villain-ous about Tiresias. To make amends to both Chariclo and the strickenTiresias, she conferred on him a staffthat would guide his steps as well asif he had eyesight, and made him a prophet.Incidentally, Kronos was father to between five and seven of the twelveOlympians, mostly by the cretan goddess Rhea; for the Earth is the moth-er of the gods as well as of oracles. Normally included are Zeus, Hera,Poseidon, Hestia and Demerer; some traditions credit him with father-ing Hephastus upon Heru; he is also an alternative father of Aphrodire.He and Rhea were also the parents of Hades, who while not Olympianin the strictest sense, shared the rule of the whole world with Zeus andPoseidon. Finally, in Thrace, seducing the nymph Philyra in the form of ahorse, he sired Chiron the Centaur.So Chiron and Chariclo, who fostered many heroes, raised Tiresias.He was certainLy the son of Chariclo, and probably also son of Chiron.Chirons human alias may have been Sciron. In any case, Tiresias couldnot hope for a better family background. He was related ro Apollo on hismothert side, and possibly to the king of the gods in rhe pre-Olympianage on his father's. Also, while Chiron could cerrainly teach warriors like"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Achilles about spears, in addition he knew music, hunting and medi-cine. His other skill was ethics, making Chiron himself sound curiouslyPythagorean. Chiron's medicine is curious too, he apParently replacedAchilles'ankle bone with that of a giant. This suggests a role as an initia-tory spirit or god in a ritualistic ordeal.This account of Tiresias has dwelt on the lesser known asPects of hislegend. There is no need to consider his various prophecies here, or his rolein many Greek myths. There is one more aspect of his legend to mention,which is one of the most interesting. His gift of prophecy was retainedafter death, along with his staff, which like that of Hermes was golden.Whereas in Homer most of the departed are shadows of their formerselves until temporarily revivified by offerings of blood, Tiresias alone re-tained his full powers at all times. When Odysseus visited the outskirtsof Hades to conjure spirits and learn his way home, it was to Tiresias heparticularly wished to speak. For this reason he held his sword over theblood of the sacrifice, to keep the other spirits from it, until Tiresias hadrevealed what he wished to know."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"HOMERIC NECROMANCYORNELIUS AGRIPPA CALLED THE ELEVENTH BOOK Of thc OdYSSCY thcI'lecromancy oJ Homer.The grimoire known as the Arbatel oJ Magicrefers to his Psycbagogia (Aphorism 48), and credits his knowledgeto necromantic spirits. Respected modern editors have given it the titleof the Book of the Dead.It is by far the oldest, mosr prestigious accounrof necromanric processes in Classical literature. It has much in commonwith other accounts of necromantic ritual, despite Homer's distinctiveview of the dead, and deserves arrenrion here. Despite what I considerHomer's reduction of the power of the dead, and the apparenr absence ofhuman magicians among his cast, his account plainly conrains authentictraditions. In fact a necromantic process on Homeric lines can be read-ily extrapolated from the text. There are detectable resemblances to theprocesses of the grimoires; whether as a resulr of long tradition, of directliterary infuence, or - as seems most likely - of both.Odysseus as necromancer,like all necromancers, is a seeker after knowl-edge. His motive is to discover how to rerurn to his homeland and fam-ily, overcoming the enmity of the sea-god Poseidon; his divination by thedead is required ro accomplish this. His qualifications derive from hisaristocratic rank, which conferred religious status, and his heroic narure.He also has the advice of Circe (Odyttry to: 48o-54o), who is ar once agoddess and a witch or sorceress. In this Circe is comparable to the femaleDactyls, who are both sorceresses and divinities.The relationship between odysseus and Circe is also capable of areligio-magical interpretation. The status it confers is at once royal andpriestly. In ellect ir makes him an equivalent figure to a Thracian king, ordynastic hero; the mortal consort of the goddess. While the kingly hero ismortal, and the goddess is divine, theirs is a sexual relationship. An obvi-ous comparison is the equivalent relarionship ofJason and Medea, who isCirce's kinswoman. This heroic love also conrrasrs with odysseus'quitedistinct relationship with Athena, and that ofJason with Hera. From thisemerges a more primitive, or, rather, a more magical Odysseus."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"As Circe informs him, in order to perform his necromantic evocationOdysseus has to travel to a suitable location; the limit of Ocean in theland of the Cimmerians.

The frrst is the necromanteion of Thesprotia, onthe West coast of Northern Greece at Parga. The other is its counterpartat Baiae; the oldest Greek colony in Italy, which again is situated on theWest coast. Both of these were sanctuaries of Hades and Persephone, andtheir locations strongly connect with the mythical geography of the Greekunderworld. The description in the Odyssey places the site at the limitsof Ocean, lending itself to the later interpretation which placed the epi-sode on the far coast of Italy. It is close to the coast, appropriate to bothin equal proportion, and their Western location also suits details given inthe text. It is found where two infernal rivers pour thunderously into theAcheron. While the Greek necromanteion is near to the physical locationof these rivers, the Italian site is situated at Lake Avernus, essentially iden-tified with the Acheron. Homer could have been acquainted with eitherof them, at least by repute. It is important to note however that Homercompletely omits to mention that Odysseus is visiting a site dedicated todivination by the dead.It is not uncommonly supposed that hero cults arelater than Homer due to precisely such omissions.The ritual Odysseus performs according to Circe's instructions, whichis mirrored in known Greek ritual, involves digging a trench the lengthand u'idth of a man's arm. Odysseus ffIoves around this trench pouringofferings to the dead. These consist of a mixturc of honey and milk, fol-lowed by sweet wine, and lastly water. Over these is sprinkled white barley,after which the spoken evocation of the dead is made. A promise is thenmade to the dead that, upon his safe arfivaL home, a barren heifer will besacrificed to the dead. The pyre for the burnt offering is to include a massof precious materials, and there is to be a separate sacrifice of a {rne blackewe for Tiresias."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"HON{ERIC NECROMAN(]YThere are several resemblances in these procedures to rhe magic of laterperiods. In physical terms these resemblances consist of the circumam-bulations and the offerings. In addition however there is the promise of agift to the spirits when what is required of them has been realised. Thisis all the more interesting, as superficially odysseus is only seeking direc-tions, and not of all the dead, but of Tiresias alone. This promise howevermakes the rite specifically magical; the spirits are being asked for some-thing, whether explicitly or otherwise. The ritual then proceeds with thesacrifice of a ram and a black ewe:Seizing the uiclim sheep I pierced tbeir throats;Flowed the black blood, and flled the hollow trencb;Then from the abyss, eager their tbi\\l to slake,Came swarming up tbe $irits of tbe dead.An important detail is that at the slaying of the animals their heads areheld down, towards the underworld, while odysseus rurns his head aside,towards the Ocean, Such averting the eyes is a consrant feature of under-world rites, for instance sacrifices to Hades and Hecate. It also identifiesthe position of the magician, in this case odysseus: he is standing ro theWest of the trench, which forms a reservoir for the blood of the sacrifice.At this stage the dead appear in their multitudes. Here too rhere is a re-semblance to goeric riruals appearing in the grimoires. The conjurationsof the Key of Solomon bringforth nor one spirit, but great armies of spiritsin order of rank, appearing from all sides. Such a vision of countless spir-its surrounding the circle forms a paft of Benvenuto Cellini's eye wirnessaccount of grimoire processes; in other words it accords with both theSolomonic and the Homeric traditions.odysseus now, following rhe advice of Circe, brandishes his sword overthe blood to keep the ghosts from it until Tiresias has appeared and spo-ken to him. This use of the sword involves a theme exhibited throughoutthe grimoires. As Cornelius Agrippa expresses it:"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"[$irits] fear swords, and knives. These [weapons] without doubtHomer seemed to be sensible ofl, when in the eleventh book of hisOdyssey... he lOdysseus] with his sword drawn did keep offgl'roStsfrom the blood of the sacrifice.At this stage there is a task for the men who follow Odysseus, who equatewith the Companions of the Magus in the Key o.f Solomon. Th\"y are toflay and prepare the bodies of the sacrificed animals for the pyre, makethe burnt offering and pray to (invoke) Hades and Persephone. Odysseusmeanwhile stays seated and motionless; with his sword in his hand pre-venting the dead from approaching the blood until Tiresias appearsand speaks to him. When Tiresias arrives and recognises him he bidsOdysseus step back from the trench, withdrawing his sword, so that hemay approach the blood.The seer Tiresias is the object of the evocation; in other words the ritualis effectively a conjuration of Tiresias. Other spirits aPPear first, a gfeatmany of them, appearing in order of rank. The theurgic concept of ritual,based on interprerations of existing lore and practice, also anticipated theappearance of spirits in order of rank and status. So too do the grimoires.Homer's necromancy is certainly no excePtion. Prior to the appearance ofTiresias, the spirit Odysseus sees 6rst is a foolish man, the most recent ofhis crew to die. Among the nameless horde that appears at this time healso identifies his own mother. After the conversation with Tiresias otherspirits are identified. A somewhat chauvinistic concept of rank aPPears tobe at play here. Odysseus speaks with his mother, and then sees or identi-fres the womenfolk of other great men; after these he sees heroes of theTrojan War, and after them divine and mythical figures: Minos, judge ofthe dead; Tityus, an important frgure to be described later; Tantulus andSisyphus, both conspicuous figures in the Classical underworld; frnallyHeracles, though this is not a true ghost, as this hero is not resident in thelJnderworld but on Olympus, while his phantom dwells below.

This too accords well withgrimoire practice, where the names of the superiors of the desired spiritare invoked.In terms of the grimoires Tiresias is the spirit being conjured.In Greek terms this spirit is an oracular hero, Tiresias is the voice of theoracle.

Although never fuILy accepted, in recent yearsthis position has, to say the least, been strongly challenged. However, itis important to understand how the position arose in the first place. Onecause was the long established preference for viewing the Greeks as a ra-tional culture, and the darker aspects of magic as irrational and henceincompatible, While this position has been steadily eroded by modernscholarship, another cause, perhaps equally strong, has not been exam-ined. This is the modern tendency to departmentalise ideas. Along withthis there has also been a tendency to assume the author knows whatnecromancy is in the first place. The image in their minds has usually beendrawn from late Classical and even medieval sources. The expectation hasconsequently been that necromancy is always gruesome and grotesque.The notion that necromancy always involves sensationalist activitiesby marginal figures, combined with a rigid departrnentalisation foreignto Greek ideas, ignores major and central aspects of Greek divinatorypractice. One principal area has been overlooked consistently. Greek andRoman divination frequently involved observation of signs attending re-ligious rites. Alongside this must be considered the prevalence of herocults, wherein sacrifrces and other rites are offered. Observing signs at-tending such a rite is necromantic in nature. Among the Romans the deadr46"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"were known as the Manes. The word has a con'rplex meaning; it repre-sented the disembodied deceased, much as the word psycbe as used byHomer indicates a ghost. In addition the Manes were reckoned amongthe deities of the underworld, presiding over rombs, cenotaphs and burialgrounds. The Roman augurs, who were the official diviners of Rome, usedseveral methods of obtaining omens. Alrhough none of their methods wasnecromantic in the iimited sense often understood, they preceded theirobservation of signs with an invocation both ro the Manes and to thegods. The number three was sacred to the Manes, and invocations wereconsequen tly repeated three times.The Classical traditions regarding the evocarion of the dead for divi-nation are, without doubt, the principal source for European ideas onthe subject. Biblical episodes are frequently quoted in accounts of nec-romancy in the ancient world, such as the evocation of Samuel by theWitch of Endor. However, the influence of Greek and Roman literature ismore extensive, and often feshes out studies of the Biblical material. TheGreek world, both on rhe mainland and in Asia Minor and Italy (Mag.t\"Gracia), contained numerous Oracles dedicated specifically to the evoca-tion of the dead. Some titles of these places are found in the table follow-ing.It has even been suggested that originally all Oracles were of this type,and were dedicated to Hades and Persephone. These may be Olympiansubstitutes for various chthonic gods and goddesses, rarher than the origi-nal names of the deities concerned. Other than that, the suggestion hasconsiderable merit.It is a fact that the Greeks had an extensive vocabulary for describingnecromancy in all its facets. Such a vocabulary in itself demonstrates thedegree to which necromancy was an accepted part of tl-re Greek religiousworld. The Romans also possessed a considerable tradition regarding theevocation of the dead, some of it undoubtedly inherited from Greek colo-nies in Italy, as well as from the Etruscans, who made a substantial contri-bution to other aspects of Roman divination , magic and religion.

It has two meanings: the first is divi-nation by the dead; rhe other, which became common in the Middle Ages,means the Black Art and often applies ro evocarion of demons, and sor-cery generally.Ir is in the latter sense that Cellini uses the word.The art of evoking the dead for divinarory purposes was part of thereligion of most narions of the ancient world. As such it had originally nonegative associations, although some fear attached to it. Strabo and othersmake mention of its use among the Persians, and ir is possible that somespecialists in the art were counted among the sect of the Magi. Babyloniaand Egypt, among other ancient nations, all had a place for necromancyin their religion. In Greece, as also in the Roman world, necromancy wasfrequently associated with special places. These included caverns, sites involcanic regions, as well as rivers or lakes with or without a shrine. Theassociation of the dead with warer is a theme that will frequently be en-countered in this book.The waterside was a location often associated with established ora-cles of the dead. A famed oracle of this type (necromanteion) was inThesprotia in northern Greece, beside the river Acheron, which wasreckoned among the rivers of Hades; other rivers of Hades, the Cocytusand Pyriphlegethon,Lay in the same region. Thesprotia is also the regionwhere is found the oracle of Dodona. The widely famed cavern of theSibyl at Cuma in rtaly, was siruared believed to be near Lake Avernus,which also had a strong traditional association with the underworld.Another famous necromanteion was sited at Heraclea on the Black Sea.Volcanic regions were also favoured for such oracles; such as the famouscavern at Tznarus, a promonrory of Laconia which is the mosr southerlypart of Europe. This was reckoned an enrrance to Hades, one of thosefrom which Heracles was said to have dragged Cerberus ro the land ofthe living.

Plutarch tells us in addition that theSpartans sent to Italy for necromancers to evoke and appease Pausaniashimself after his death, which would also involve establishing annual ritu-als for him. In Virgil's Aeneid a visit to the lJnderworld, commenced atCuma on Lake Avernus, apparently replaces the ritual. While none ofthese accounts are precise historical documents, they nevertheless dem-onstrate the familiarity of necroman cy, and its widesprcad acceptance, inthe Classical period.GbosrsThe subject of ghosts as understood by the Greeks is sufficiently impor-rant to require some elucidation. There are, understandably, resemblancesbetween their ideas and more widespread folklore themes; imputing aGreek origin to any of these is far from my intention. Nevertheless, it isuseful to have some idea of the classes of ghosts concerned and the differ-ences involved. This is therefore a surnmary geared towards practice andunderstanding of the original sources.One important class of ghosts are those denied proper funeral rites.These form a major c^tegory along with other spirits who for whateverreason cannot enter the Underworld. There were essentially three tyPesin this class: those who had died before their time, who wandered forthe intended period of their earthly life, those who had suflered a violentdeath, and the unburied. Murder victims and executed criminals belongessentially to the same class. Since none of these can cross the River Styx,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"CI-ASSICA I, NEC]ROMAN(]Ythey are restless spirits. As a resul t, they can and will haunt of their ownvolition, or through magical manipulation.Female ghosts of those denied fulfilment in life, by the standards of theculture, form another major class. Such fulfilment involved marriage andchildren; while male ghosts of this rype essentially resemble that above,the equivalent female ghosts are importanr enough to treat as a separatetype. So important indeed that there are named individuals of this rype inthe mythology. Some personify rhe type and are essentially goddesses ordaimons; others are particularly imporranr ghosts, though the exact dis-tinction can be uncertain. Lamia, Medea and other key figures are, to oneextent or other, personified forms of this class of ghosr, or of participantsin archaic rituals of Hera and Artemis involving them. These ghosrs posea threat to women who have yer ro achieve the fulfilment denied rhem,and to children. In the event that a woman succumbs to the assaults ofsuch a spirit, she will become anorher of the same type.Substantial vestiges of ritual and imagery concerning rhese ghosts areclearly perceptible in goetic tradition. The precise cultural conrext in-volves factors that in our present culture do not have the same weight.This does not necessarily diminish rheir importance for us, particularly asfigures like Lamia and Medea are more complex, subsuming orher themeswithin themselves. These themes include archaic female initiation ritesand the personnel involved in them. Their association with both Hera andArtemis makes of them an irnplicit reflex of Goddess spiriruality, repress-ing which is decidedly unwise.Ghosts of children were important to ancient beLief, and their connec-tion to both the above types is clear. They could of course be victims of thevampiric female ghosts of childless women, or have died by orher means.In either case, denied fulfilment of their lives they fall into the class abovedescribed. However, being immature as well as intensely frustrated, theywere dangerous and particularly prone to magical manipularion.Ghosts haunting battlefields fall naturally into the class of ghosts suffer-ing violent death and frequently the class of unburied dead &c.

This is certainly true of ancient Greektraditions, and of many other ancient cultures, as well as very common infolkloric traditions. The idea is current that this has little connection withthe traditions of the grimoires, where demons are fallen angels. Despitethe reality of the intrusion of this Judao-Christian idea, such a supposi-tion is still an erroneous modern simplification. Not only are the grimoi-res direct descendents of traditions, literary and oral, where the identityof dead and demon is central, but the genre also retains numerous explicitand implicit points of contact with the older belief.So too the conjuration in the grimoire tradition of heroes or of histori-cal persons has frequently been portrayed in fiction and historical works.The plays of Goethe and Marlow regarding Doctor Faustus describe theconjuring of Alexander the Great and of Helen of Troy (herself a queenr52"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"GHOSTS, DEMONS & THE GRIMOIRESof the underworld), while in A Pleasant Treatise of Witches Q673) conjura-tions of Achilles, Hector and of King David, supposed to take place at thecourt of Maximilian, are described.On occasion such apparitions are attributed to the tricks and im-personations of devils, but in fact. reflect more ancient practice, such asApollonius of Tyanas conjuration of Achilles. The imposrure of damnedspirits also appears as a back dated explanation of older practices, for ex-ample the conjuration of the soul of the prophet Samuel by the Witchof Endor. Its logic is comparable to the idea that fossils were included inGod's creation to make the world seem older than 4oo4 nce, when hemade it in six days.While arguing the case at length is hardly required, the grimoires them-selves provide us with a shorthand substantiation of such agreement:Erik de Pauw drew my attenrion to two conjuring books where theidentification is explicit: the 6rst is Herpentil's Black Magic (supposed dateryo1), the subtitle of which tells us it includes Conjurations and Names oJthe powerful Gbosts. An enlarged German edition of the Grand Grimoire,called the True Red Fiery Dragon, explicitly rerms rhe demons 'Ghostslgreatff and lesser; many of these are identical with spirits known from theGoetia oJ Solomon While current popularity is no gauge of importance inan under-explored genre, another example is better known; rhis is DoctorFaust's Great and Powerful Sea-Gbost Q69z), This title reminds us that inGreek lore being lost at sea was a potent maker of restless ghosts.Another text cited by de Pauw bears the title lvlysterious Heroes Treasure,where again linkage with ancient ideas is apparent in the title.If this infer-ence appears strained, consider those important figures from history andmyth, including Helen and other figures from Homer, said to be conjuredby magicians such as Faust. In any case, it is course a fact, whether appre-ciated by Solomonic conjurers today or not, that goetia is directly equiva-lent to necromancy. Many grimoires while dealing exclusively with conju-ration and talismans (such as the Black Pullet) explicitly claim to teach thisart. So then, either lurking in the background or staring us in the face, anidentification of many spirits of the grimoires with the spirits of the deadis both present and correct."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIA[t is of course necessary to distinguish levels within the ranks of the dead,as among the scarcely distinguishable demons.

These asked for a cure for rhedrought, and were bidden by the Pythian prie$tess to go ro Trophoniosat Lebadeia and to discover the remedy from him. Coming to Lebadeiathey could not 6nd the oracle.

Thus it appears some elements of thetraditions concerning Trophonios may refl,ect late attempts by Delphi toassimilate older Trophonian traditions to theirs.

Thewater fowed, they say, from the place where the Maid took up the stone,and hence the river received the name of Hercyna.This river goddess, with her connections with Demeter and Persephone,was certainly closely involved with the oracular cult of Trophonios, asPausanias makes clear:On the bank of the river there is a temple of Hercyna, in which is amaiden holding a goose in her arms. In the cave are the source of theriver and images dtanding, and serpents are coiled around their scep-tres- One might conjeCture the images to be of Asclepius and Hygeia,but they might be Trophonios and Hercyna, because they think thatserpents areju$t as sacred to Trophonios as to Asclepius... the moftfamous things in the grove are a temple and image of Trophonios; theimage, made by Praxiteles, is after the manner of Asclepius.

She gave him achariot drawn by winged dragons, and wheat which sprouted everywhereon the earth as he flew over it.According to Plutarch the priests who attended the oracle ofTrophoniosare linked to the Dactyls who instituted and celebrated the Mysteries ofSamothrace, and derive from the pre-Olympian age of Kronos. They weresons of Erginus, one of the Argonauts. tophonios and Agamedes canbe compared with Castor and Pollux, also Argonauts, who are connectedwith the Cabirs. A temple in the grove of tophonios housed images ofKronos, Hera and Zeus, a triad which represents the local equivalent ofthe Cabiri. Regarding such archaic origins it is striking that tophonios'shade was serpentine in form, reminiscent of the Python supposed tohave formerly owned Apollo's oracle in the mythic past.The celebrated Pythagorean magician, Apollonius of Tyana, who wasworshipped as a god after death, is reputed to have written a book con-cerning The Oracle of Trophonlos which was once owned by the EmperorHadrian, and consulted by Philostratus the biographer of Apollonius.Apollonius found what he learned at the oracle fully in accord withPythagorean teachings. The waters of Lethe and Mnemosyne are strik'ingly in accord with the Vision of Er related in Plato's Republic and theso called Orphic plates found in tombs, sometimes thought to be Neo-Pythagorean. Similarly these waters have parallels in the older writingsof Hesiod.The rites attending the oracle of tophonios were extremely complex,and undoubtedly derived from cultic initiation ceremonies. They beganwith an extended purification over several days, and sequestration in atemple of the Goddess of Good Fortune and of the Agathodaimon.

Even so, the distance between a callfrom the gods and an accidental event is reduced when it transpires thatEr - rather than any other combatanr on rhat d^y - has been selected asa messenger to the living.However interesting apocalyptic literatur e may be in itself however, itis more essendal to our purposes that Plato's tripartite schema is verti-cal, above is good and grearer, and below is bad and lesser. Its three lev-els equate misleadingly easily with what our culrure calls Heaven, Earthand Hell. In this important respect this is completely distinct from olderGreek ideas about the afterlife; in which the underworld was the abodeof the dead, good or bad. Punishment and reward are also significant ele,ments of Plato's eschatology, which bears comparison with Orphic ideasof expiation.

It precededa still greatff departure of increasing influence into rhe latest period ofGraco-Roman culture. This involved varied projections of the afterlifeeither mostly or entirely into the heavens.In many insrances this involvedor assumed a transferral or projection of the geography of Hades ontothe sky; complete with its rivers, Islands of the Blessed and other impor-tant locations. Such developments, interconnected with Babylonian asrro-logical thought, represenr a crucial srage in the development of Westernmagic, Very many features of Western magic as we know it are a directconsequence of these events, and would be instantly recognised if listed.This must wait however, as the most powerful and central aspects of thecontext in which they 6rst arose are all too frequently overlooked.16g"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"In Plato's mph the asphodel meadow of Hades is an aedal place, in theupper atmosphere, while Tartarus remains underground. Subsequentlythis was extended, as in Plutarch for whom the river Styx flowed upwardsfrom the Earth to the Moon, and the Asphodel Meadows are transferredto the space between Earth and the Moon, which luminary plays a veryconspicuous part in Plutarch's eschatologyrEvery soul, whether without mind, or joined to mind, on departingfrom the body, is ordained to wander in the region lying between themoon and earth for a term, not equal in all cases; but the wicked andincontinentpay a.penalty for their sins; whereas the virtuous, in order,as it were, to purify themselves and to recover breath, after the body, asbeing the source of sinful pollution, muft pass a certain fixed time inthe mildest region of air, which they call the Meadow of Hades.Tantalisingly, Plato tells us the ritual specialists or goetes described them-selves as Children of the Moon, so perhaps these lunar associations areearlier than is currently thought. In any case, in various religions of lateantiquity the relocation is extended even further. Under the inlluence ofastrological ideas from Chaldean and laterJewish sources the seven plane-tary gods, with their near all-encompassing role in human destiny, becomethe hostile Archons of Gnosticism. The origins of these gods may lie inseven evil stars, rather than planets, in Babylonian star-lore, In the emer-gent systerns they bore malign infuence over incarnating souls descendingthrough their domains towards the Earth, and after death impeded theirdeparture to the higher realms. By contrast, while the frery wild men ofPlato's vision with their scourges superficially approach to the Christianconception of demons, there is no suggestion that they are themselvesdamned. Nevertheless, Plutarch's myths, which typify the subsequenttransfer of Hades to the sky, contain a more developed demonology.Greek mythological language was undergoing an evolution, which some-times collided with the more pessimistic forms of astrology. The negativeconceptions of planetary gods or angels, the Archons of Gnosticism , wereboth compatible and convergent with these tendencies."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"'IA REXL]RGATPlutarch indeed may be the most ancient source for the association ofthe planets with eschatological events on this model. In his On the delaysof Divine Wngeance the vices of descending souls are associated - as inPlato's Gorgias - with physical scars. Plutarch, who is influenced by popu-lar tradition and useful fbr that reason, goes further. He associares thesevices also with specilic colours; which correlare precisely with Hermeticastrological correspondences of the period. Thus too a soul guilty ofmeanness, associated wirh Saturn, he gives a dark and dirty colou r; envy,the vice ofJupiter he associates with violet; cruelty and harshness, whichare Martial vices, he associates with rhe colour red, and so on. Althoughthe astrological associations are not made explicit, there can be little doubtwhat the origins of these colour associations were. Thus, the comprehen-sive astrological eschatology thar was flourishing in the 2\",1 century ADappears to have its first wirness in Plutarch.The roots of such thinking in Greek circles can be traced far earlier thanPlato; Heraclitus held the soul to be a spark of sidereal essence, and its or-igins in the stars were a commonplace of Ionian thought. Empedocles alsopreceded Plato in giving a dualistic twist to this conception. In Platonicthought particularly, physical incarnation was a prison, repeated incarna-tions being required to overcome material obstacles to returning to thecontemplation of Divine Beauty in the highest sphere. So too from the 3..1century sce Hellenistic astrological thought made the interconnecrednessof the planetary worlds and human fate an increasingly familiar idea. Asin Plato the personification of these forces was a powerful factor, wherehe gives us Ananke and the Fates, the Judges and the sirens, so roo inastrological thought the decans, planets, the Arabic Parrs, degrees and soon were all understood as personified mythological intelligences. So tooastrology itself was held to be literaily a divine science, in which the rev-elations of destiny were comprehended as if in a vision. This is also seenin Jewish apocalyptic literature, the Book of Enoch conrains references tovisionary journeys revealing calendrical and astrological secrets.Broadly speaking, two widespread and influential consequences ofthese influences on religious and philosophical thought are to be under-stood: the development of celestial roles by chthonic deities, mosr notably"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Persephone and Cybele, and the perception of demonic qualities in celes-tial gods; including but not restricted to those associated with the planets,and even the Creator or Demiurge. Most strikingly evident of the trans-formative power of such ideas is that seen in some Gnostic movements.In a startlingly creative interpretation of Genesis the God of the OldTestament becomes the demonic chief of the hostile Archons, themselvesidentical with major Angels in conventional systems. However these ideasare neither restricted to expression in Gnosticism nor reliant on Jewishmaterials, their influence is apparent throughout the Magical Papyri andin much of the thought of later antiquity.Plato's transferral of the Isles of the Blessed to indeterminate placesin the heaven was soon clarified. Iamblichus - the head of the SyrianNeoplatonist school, (died 33o eo) - records a dictum attributed to thePythagoreans locating the Isles of the Blessed in the Sun and Moon; thismay represent a late, fully developed form of the process. If so, Plutarch(died r4o ncE) far precedes it by presenting an entire eschatological lu-nar landscape, which simultaneously illustrates the transferral of chthonicdeities:... there are deep places and gulf-like in the moon, whereof the largestis called Hecate's dungeon, in which the souls either sufl-er or infli&punishmenr, for the rhings which they have either done or endured ...The schema is consciously building on Plato, the Moon is a transitionalregion between the lower earth and the higher planetary spheres leadingto the Fixed Stars and beyond. Thus Plutarch invests her with upper andlower portalsr... as for the two smaller depths, because the souls pass through themon the \\4/ay towards heaven and towards earth back again, the one (fac-ing the Sun) is denominated the Elysian Plain, the other (facing theEarth) the Passage of Persephone the Terreftriall"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The higher worlds are occupied by the gods and their retinues, but theMoon is the preserve of rerresrrial daimons, which is to say the dead.The very rerm terrestrial appears contradictory in this context, and itsuse shows the pace at which ideas were evolving while terminology srrug-gled to keep pace.

Interestingly this philosopherwizard came from the ciry of Heraclea, where a famous necromantic ora'cle fourished. In the tradition of many of our goetes he practiced self-deification, as well as admiring several figures examined in this volumethat had done likewise. Unsympathetic accounts of him appear to recall(and lampoon) a practicing goetic philosopher, whose end was associatedwith translation to heaven, A mysterious serpent features in the accountDiogenes Lartius gives of these events; suggestive of a posthumous herocult, perhaps on the model of Glycon. Unsurprisingly Heraclides wrorea book on the famous figure of Abaris, another on catalepsy and yet art-other on things seen in the underworld; aII that is missing is a work onthe Argonauts. In the course of his writing he developed a fictional foilfor his ideas, named Empedotimus; obtained by combining the names ofEmpedocles and Hermotimus.This hero's exploits included a vision ofjust such a celestial Underworld,including a variant on its geography better known in another form. Plato'sopenings to the realms above and below were developed by this writer andothers into veritable gates with definite celestial locations.

More importantly it differsfrom the classification found larcr, perhaps beginning with Numenius,but very infuential overall, of two gares. Ir is possible, though perhapsnot likely, that Heraclides extrapolated his third gare from the only otherroute mentioned in the Vision of Er.This, of course, is the way back out ofthe cave where the events in the vision take place.In the better known astrological form of the celestial gates there are two,and tl-reir locations are not those of Heraclides. Called the Gate of theGods and the Gate of Men, these were situated in Capricorn and Cancerrespectively. By means of these gates souls ascended to the realms aboveor descended into incarnation. It is afact integral to this conceprion thatthe Milky Way intersects the Zodiac at these two points; or rather ir didso in the era when these systems were formulated. The Milky Way wasreferred to by Heraclides as the Path of Souls traversing the HeavenlyHades. Similar language occurs in the papyri with reference to the zodiacas a processional way,Both were stellar highroads for the journeying ofsouls, the zodiac of course being also the road of the Sun, Moon and thefrve planets. It is as well to begin distinguishing the two luminaries fromthe planets, as Pherecydes did for instance, as they were frequently treateddillerently in systems oF this kind. The five planets were often associatedwith the evil Archons, whereas the Sun and Moon generally remained be-nign,precisely because rhey areluminaries.In Manichean myth the LunarNodes were counted arnong the'evil planets' in order to maintain the ca-nonical number seven when excepting the luminaries as benign.The celestial Hades, with variations, became a very widespread themein the evolution of beliefs. A creative ferment had taken hold of the ini-tiates of Mystery schools, members of Gnostic sects, on magicians andphilosophers. A major theme of these events was focus on knowledge ofthe names of astrological guardians, of routes through rhe celestial un-derworld, of seals or characters associated with them; these were secrets"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"that assured the initiate of a privileged existen ce after death, and bestowedpower on the magician.There is no firm evidence of any kind that the mys-tical elevation of the soul was ever believed to occur during life. Exceptionsto this rule have been suggested in the case of the cults of Mithras andCybele, but this has not been demonstrated and is likely erroneous. Onthe other hand the techniques of many of the goetic magicians, such asEmpedocles, had the clear goal of self-deification. Nevertheless, this tooappears to have culminated in the post-mortem state, even though god-like abilities were claimed during their earthly career. The things seen andthe powers exercised by these mystics and magicians however clearly an'ticipated such an event.As has been seen, the Sun and Moon were equated with the Isles of theBlessed and also with rulers of the Underworld in the Sky. This meantparticularly Persephone in the case of the Moon, but also Dis Pater inthe case of the Sun. This much is fairly straightforward, even if the ideaof these deities ruling the luminaries seems counter'intuitive from a con-ventional view of myth. On the other hand, what are we to make of theGates in Cancer and Capricorni There is, to be sure, solar and lunar sig-nificance to these two signs; but might there be something elsei The rulerof Cancer in Olympian rather than planetary terms is Hermes, the guideof souls. This is obviously appropriate to the themes here. So if Hermesis bringing souls down into incarnation - or, following Plato and oldermythology, bringing them to Hades - then who is their guide to the realmof the godsiGlancing at the Orphic correspondences for the Sign of Capricorn, thegoddess Hestia is faithfully but fairly unhelpfully named there. However,when Dionysus was raised to the status of an Olympian, Hestia surren-dered her place to him. On revising our table in accordance with this,Dionysus is revealed as the patron of souls entering the realm of thegods. This has, to say the least, the ring of an authentic interpretationthat would have comrnended itself to Orphic magicians and others. Themythic precedent for Dionysus in this role is of course his rescue of hismother Semele from the Underworld, bringingher into the company ofthe gods.176"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The removal of the Underworld into the sky caused massive disruptionsin categories of gods, angels and other immortals, both celesrial and ch-thonic.

Equally this upheaval transferred deities and others from one placeto another, retaining the same srarus as previously enjoyed.

Ananke possessed a templein Corinth, considered so holy that only her priests could enter. This de-serves to be born in mind when Corinthian traditions recur later in thiswork.In popular tradition, Ananke increasingly came to be seen as a goddessof death, which may partly explain her considerable role in the MagicalPapyri (see for example pcM rv where she appears at 605; additionallySeven Fates - identified with the Seven Hathors - apper at 669 and thepivot of the universe at 680 e 68r).

More conventional Jovist schemas reckon themdaughters of Zeus and Themis, and name them Clotho, Lachesis andAtropos; representing respectively the spinner of fate, the assigner of foptune and the unavoidable doom.Other authors variously make them daughters of Erebus or Kronosand Night, of Gaia and Oceanus, or indeed of Ananke. While some madenone but Zeus superior to their decree, this is plainly an intermediatestage of religious thought. In the late period, and in the older form, everykind of being has its fate allotted by them, and even the gods - yea Zeushimself - durst not oppose them. On occasion Persephones name was in-cluded with this trio, who - like the Sirens - were seen as her attendants.Not surprisingly perhaps Persephone frequently disputed with Atroposthe right of cutting the thread of life; in effect,both are goddesses of death.The Fates are goddesses of birth as well as death, presiding over everybirth and life; spinning the fate of every newborn, and prophesying theirfate. They were frequently depicted as ministers of Hades, and seen seatedat his feet. Elsewhere, in accordance with the Platonic schema, they aredepicted on radiant thrones of their own, amidst the spheres of heaven,crowned and robed with starry vestments.Clotho the youngest presided over the moment of birth, she held ascroll (the book of fate), or a distaff for spinning wool in her hand withwhich she wove the thread of hfe; her distaffwas said to be a pole reachingfrom heaven to earth.

Her images in various parrs of theGreek and Roman world are instructive; Boeotia's rustic traditionalismmay giveit more weight than some of the orhers, and here she was r\"pr\"-sented with the pole star over her head and holding Plutos god of richesin her arms. The supposed moral of this figure was that fortune is thesource of riches and honours, but given rhe connection of the Fates withPersephone, a connection with the Mysteries is more likely. The Italiancity of Antium was the foremost Latin shrine, receiving gifts and offer-ings from all parts of Italy. As a protector of cities like the goddessesHecate and Cybele, Tyche bore the title Pherepolis, which has that mean-ing. In this role, which is also strongly linked ro Hera, she often wore a'mural crown'. Another title is significant, Acrea, which she bore from herCorinthian temple. This stood on a prominence, or in Greek akron.Therewas an important shrine of Hera on this site, in consequence of which shebears the same title.Her Roman name is the derivation of the Part of Fortune in astrol-ogy.

Having mentioned astrological pessimism, a sidelighr on the natureof Tyche highlights the fact thar this was and is not the only perspective.In Hellenistic syncretism, Tyche was strongly associated with the goddessIsis. As Isis-Tyche or Isis-Forruna, she did nor represent implacable fate,but rather the positive use of foreknowledge. The association with lotsin divination is extremely ancient, reflected in rheir use by the Sibyl ofCuma, and at the ancient and prestigious temple of Fortuna at Praenesre(see Book Six).Important symbols of Fortuna include a wheel, commemorated in thecircled cross that forms her astrological symbol, and the rudder or prowof a ship. There were no les than six shrines of Fortuna in various formsin the city of Rome alone. Her forms were indeed varied, and includedFemale Fortune and Fortuna Virilis, also Equestrian, Evil, Peaceful andVirgin Fortunes and so on.A festival of Venus was held among the Romans on April r\", in whichItalian widows and marriageable women assembled in shrines of FortunaVirilis. A rite was celebrated in which incense was burned in her honour,and the women assembled stripped themselves naked. The apparent ideawas to entreat the goddess to concealany blemishes from the eyes of po-tential husbands and suitors. This is in itself a form of love magic; how-ever, there is also a strange resemblance to Corinthian legend involving theaforementioned temple of Hera. This must await discussion in Book Five.T-he Fates continuedThe Latin Parcae correspond exactly with the Moirae, and again Parcawas originally a goddess of birth, with sisters Nona and Decima presid-ing over different months of birth. Parcae came ro be applied to them as acollective term corresponding to Moirae, with Nona and Decima presid'ing over the birth and allotment of fate, and a third, Morra, allotting rhedeath.

Hyginus credits the Fates with devising 6ve of the letters ofthe Greek alphabet: alpha, bera, eta, tau and upsilon (Aa BB Hri Tr ^fu).Doubtless connected with this is the tradition terming them secretaries ofheaven, and keepers of the archives of destiny.Dramatis Personae concludedThe other major players in Plato's accounr are the Sirens and Judges.Most of what there is to say about the Sirens follows later, whil e an ac-count of the Judges preceded this section.

Thus the erotic idyll of the Argonauts was concludedand they set out once more upon the waves. Far in the future however,from the fruit of one union in Lemnos, Greeks would later honour theirgods in Libya; dwelling in the divine city of Cyrene, and ruled by counselsof wisdom.Of interest to this study is the character of the Argonauts' herald,who they despatch to announce themselves to the women of Lemnos.Aethalides was a son of Hermes, and shared many of his characteristics.His role of herald of the Argonauts is suited to the son of the herald of thegods, whose wand he bears. He also possesses an all encompassing mem-ory. Even after the waters of underworld Acheron claim him, his memory,like that of Tiresias, is retained. He also had the power, after death, ofliving alternately in Hades and in the world of men, and thus knowingeverything that takes place in both worlds. According to Pphagoreantradition, as recorded by the Neoplatonist Porphyry, Pythagoras was alater incarnation of this Argonaut. Considering the importance of theArgonauts legend in Orphic writings, this connection is undoubtedly sig-ni6cant.Even if the interlude in the Argonautica is of comparatively little im-portance, Lemnos itself plays an integral part in many of the themes aris-ing in this study; It is striking though that the island residence of thegod Heph&stus, whose men like him were tireless metalworkers, is in theArgonautict portrayed as inhabited only by women armed with shield,helmet and spear. There are thus no men resembling Hephastus, but nu-merous women resembling Athena. By contrast a fragment of a play byAeschylus represents the Argonauts being greeted to the island by hard-drinking dwarfike Cabirs. It is as well to remember that Aeschylus andApollonius were Iiterary men, handling archaic themes with artistic Ii-cense.

By contrast, ashas been observed by various writers, Hephastus appears to have beenincluded in Olympian myth chie{ly as a figure of fun. The semi-comic na-rure of much Classical myth concerning him also illustrates well the tre-mendous gap between Classical myth and actual religious practice. Givenhis non-Greek origins these myths are best read as reinterpretations ofolder traditions from Asia Minor and Thracian islands. The almost slap-stick nature of his role in later Olympian myth contrasts sharply withhis part in Homer's'Iliad. When Achilles hurls himself across the bat-tlefield in a berserk fury of destruction he resembles a typhoon ratherthan a human being. Human prowess is of no account against him, hisprogress is opposed successfully only by the god of the river Scamander,whose watery power engulfs the hero. The intervention of Hephastus(Iliad zr:342), who dries up the river Scamander with blasts of coruscat-ing heat, eclipses the portrayal of the other Olympians in the work. Infact the representation of the daimonic power of Achilles, Scamander andHephastus is without parallel in the entire lliod; the only comparison isthe power of Poseidon in the Odyssey.There are various accounts of his birth, of which the most acceptedis that Hera conceived him alone, after Zeus had given birth to Athene"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"without female assisrance. Zeus subsequently kicked him down fromMount olympus in fury at his coming ro the aid of Hera after Zeus hadhung her up in chains. He took all day to fall ro earth, and was caughtin the arms of the inhabitanrs of Lemnos, receiving crippling injuries tohis legs. Lemnos was inhabited as this time by a Thracian people knownas the Sinti, also known as the Sapaei. Of three Thracian clans living onthe island one called itself the Hephaistion, and claimed descent from thegod. The geographer Strabo, a narive of Cappadocia writing in the timeof the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius, specifically associares this tribewith the Chalybes, a caste of metallurgists whose importance will be de-lineated later.The Homeric account of the birth of Hephastus differs, making himthe son of Zeus and Hera. Homer credits Hera with throwing him intothe sea. Crippled by the fall he was rescued by the Oceanid Eurynome,and Thetis, a female sea deity who was the mother of Achilles. They pro-vided him with an underwater metallurgy workshop, and taught him rhemysterious arts of which he was the patron. Later he repaid Thetis bymaking the armour of her famous son,As the god of skilled craftsmen many inventions and devices are creditedto him. Among rhese, in Olympian rnyth, are the ner in which he snaredAphrodite and Ares, and the throne with sprung manacles in which Herawas humiliated. Whatever the original significance or form of these sto-ries, Heph&srus' aid was frequently invoked in binding spells, of whichexamples may be found in the Magical Papyri (see rcv vrr. 37g and xrr.r77,4r7, 4;.1g).The tongs of Hephasrus were a recognised magical symbolwhich invoked the power of the god, much as a drawing or engraving ofa caduceus invoked the power of Hermes. The rongs symbol occurs onso-called gnostic gems, and upon talismanic disks and nails from Romeand elsewhere; figures resembling an Aleph in early talismans may welloriginate in this symbol.His coming to the aid of Hera when she was bound indicates that hehad the power both to bind and to unbind, and could be invoked for as-sistance with either. An interesting myth is that he was the offspring notof Zeus and Hera, or another divine pair, but of the goddess Hera alone."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"In Hesiod's Tbeogony, Hera,jealous of Zeus producing Athena unaid-ed from his forehead, produced Hephestus without male intervention.Also significant, and no invention of mythographers, is his connectionwith Lemnos. This island was horne to an important cult of the Cabirs,who were seen as sons or companions of Hephasrus.It should be remem-bered that the Cyclops were also seen as companions and assistants ofHephastus. His cult on the island, while much concerned with fire andmetal work, also involved healing, particularly of snake bite.In Anatolia smiths were revered figures during the Bronze and earlyIron Age; they had a special connection with religio-political institu-tions, amountin gto a special caste. The institution of kingship among theHittites was connected to this caste in the late period. Hephastus hadprecursors and links with various deities of Asia Minor and the MiddleEast. Prominent among these analogues was a Western Semitic god calledKothar; in the second millenium scp he had his forge at Caphtor, whichwhile once identified with Crete is more likely to have been Cilicia, Cyprusor both. As the location of the forge of Vulcan under his various names isfrequently on an island, Cyprus is probably to be preferred.It is also wor-thy of recall that Cyprus was the pre-eminent home of the Asiatic god-dess known as Aphrodite to the Greeks, who was the wife of Hephastus.Religious sanctuaries with close connections to smiths'workshops arealso known on Cyprus; that at Kition dedicated to a blacksmith god andthat at Enkomi to the God on the Copper Ingot, the partner of the Goddesson a Copper Ingot.During the Egyptian domination of Syria and PalestineKothar was identified with the Egyptian god Ptah, and his forge was con-sidered to be located at Memphis. The Phoenicians considered him tobe the patron of magic; they also considered him to be the inventor ofincantations, and cognate with this also the first poet. The significanceof this last detail is important, and the term wordsmith still exists in theEnglish language, demonstrating that poetry and incantation were seen asactual devices.It also points to the pre-Greek antiquity of the connectionof poetry and magic, and their relation to the goetic fire cults."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"JPHIAGods related to Heph,testusVarious facts follow the identification of Kothar with Ptah of Memphis.Herodotus uses the name Hephastus as equivalenr ro the Egyptian god,when he tells us that dwarflike images of the Cabirs were found in theTemple of Ptah at Memphis. There are in fact many strong resemblances;the making of men and the practice of crafts employing 6re among them.Not for the 6rst time these interconnections give pause ro wonder, werethe Greek identifications of their gods with those of the Middle East re-ally recognition of shared characteristics representing common originsiThe aversion to supposed syncretism which stands in the way of suchidentifications has been useful in recognising the individuality of cultures.However, taken too far, as it frequently is, this aversion can blind us to realrelationships. Relationships that do not involve biased theories of diffu-sion from a single supposed root culture, so much as mingling of severalcultures whose knowledge of each other is not in the least controversial.Thus an examination of the resemblances between Ptah and Hephustusmay reveal a good deal about the earlier form of the'Greek'god. Ptah was,without doubt, the senior god of Memphis, among the oldest and holiestcities in Egypt. Although best known for the myth in which he makeshumans from clay, he was the god of fire-based handicrafts in general,encompassing pottery and metallurgy. Interestingly, an Athenian templeof Hephaestus was located in the potter's quarrer. There is a saying amongthe steppe peoples that the blacksmith, the potter and the shaman arebrothers. As the supreme god of Memphis Ptah was the head of a trinityof deities. His female counterpart was the goddess Sekhmer, whose mythstrongly resembles Greek myths concerning Cybele. Their son is bestknown to Western ears as Imhotep, a great builder and healer. The Sonsor Followers of Ptah at Memphis were referred to as Cabiri by the Greekhistorian Herodotus. The metalworking Dactyls may also be comparedwith the Shemsu Heru or followers of Horus who, like them, were work-ers in metals, or blacksmiths, Many references are made to these followersof Horus in Egyptian funerary rexrs. Significandy, they assisr the god invarious activities undertaken on behalf of the dead. The parentage of ther96"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Dioscuri also has parallels in Egyptian myth. The sky goddess Nuir cou-ples with the earth god Seb or Geb, who is often represented as a goose.From this are produced five gods and goddesses. Among these are Set andHorus, who were anciently represented as twin gods like the Dioscuri.Hephastus also connects with a god of the Hatti, a non Indo-Europeanpeople, who was subsequently adopted by the Hittites. This god, knownas Hassamili or Hasammeli, was also a god of metal workers, and hismythic appearances are usually in an underworld context. The cult ofHephastus bears witness to these ancient chthonic origins. Unlike thecelestial gods, where a portion of the sacrifice was kept for feasting, the of-ferings of chthonic deities were frequently burnt entire, as were funeral of-ferings to the dead. This was the practice in rites dedicated to Hephastus,the animals being a calf and a boar pig. Among the Romans his cult wasalso extremely ancient, and he bore the names of the Etruscan Mulciber,of Vulcan or Volcanus from the Lipari Islands near Sicily. He was alsoidentified with a Sicilian volcano god named Adranus, as was Hephastus,Adranus being a god of the pre-Greek population.The case of Adranus is instructive on two levels; it is revealing concern-ing an archaic fire god prior to the Olympian recasting, and also illustratesthe way important local gods were usurped by Zeus after the Greek ex-pansion beginning in the 8'l' century BcE. Adranus gave his name ro atown and river near Mount Etna. His shrine, which possessed a perpetualfire and a grove, was guarded by a thousand dogs, an animal that seems tohave been sacred to him. These temple dogs were said to be very friendlyto the inhabitants of Adranum, but ferocious to the impious. Adranuswas the father of two male deities called the Palici or Palisci. These sons ofAdranus were honoured with major rites by the Sicels. Near their shrinewas a sulphurous pool from which were emitted two perpetual geysers.These were believed to have appeared at their birth. Like the waters of theStyx, great oaths were sworn upon these waters, perjury receiving swiftsupernatural punishment. Those who swore sincerely by the deities of theplace retired unhurt. True to form with such chthonic deities, the Palicialso possessed an oracle, consulted at times of dire need, the answers ofwhich were the truest and least ambiguous. The antiquity of their rites is"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"witnessed by a tradition that they had originally been served by humansacri6ces.The tradition was altered by the Greeks, who made the Palici sons ofZeus, either by a nymph named Aerna, who may be assumed to be a god-dess of the volcano, or Thalia daughter of Hephastus. As usual with talesof Zeus and nymphs this goddess was pursued relentlessly by Hera. It wasthis that led Zeus to conceal her in the earth, from which her sons wereborn. other accounrs credit Hephastus with fathering them upon Aerna,which is perhaps closer to the Sicilian original. It is worthy of note thatAdranus has been identified by some wirh the Phoenician Adramelech, aSun god who appears in later demonolo gy, andwith a supposedly Persianfire god named Atar or Adar. Regarding the latter some scholars havebeen too eager to trace Zoroastrian links where there are none, obliviouseven to the plainly more ancienr human and horse sacrifice practiced byMagian priests during the Persian Wars.In fact the PersianYazatawhoseoriginal name was Atar predated Zoroastrianism and seems not to havebeen of Indo-Iranian origin.Prior to his absorbtion in Zoroastrianism, Atar was known as Agni inVedic religion. His origins are very vagre, although in the Vedas he is theson of Dyaus (the sky god from whence comes our Zeus) and the earthgoddess Prithivi. He was the god of the forge, and the fire of purificationand sacrifice. He also had a marked underworld role, guiding the geniiof the cremated dead to the Underworld. Agni, and related fire deities inMesopotamian religion such as the Sumerian Gibil, was invoked ar thebeginning of rites, so rhe flame would rransmir prayil to the other gods.In a striking but incomplete parallel to the Promethean myrh, Atar alsochained a demonic Asura to a rock. Against these Indo-European con-nections there are srrong links with Semitic deities; including a son ofAsherah and El from ugarit, and the god of war and the planet venuswho is brother of Astaroth. This particular identification casts an impor-tant light on the morif of Hephastus falling from heaven.All these identifications reveal Hephastus as a much older chthonic firegod of non-Greek origin. His Italian counrerparr, vulcan, predates theimportation of Classical olympian rhemes. Among the most ancient ritesrg8"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"ARGONAU'T'I(]Ain Italy concerned the variously named god of fire and metalwork, as shallbe seen when considering the Salian priests. These rites resembled thoseof the Curetes and undoubtedly derive from a related tradition. Vulcan'sfeast day was August 23'd and his place in the liturgical calendar was es-tablished in remote antiquity. An ancient Italian tradition is recorded b1'Livy, Plutarch and other Classical wrirers, which points to archaic linksbetween a cultus resembling that of Dionysus and that of the 6re god.According to this tradition Romulus was dismembered by the Senarors,much as Dionysus was by the Titans. Although Livy makes rhis slayingtake place at the Senate, the location of the ritualistic slaying according toPlutarch was the temple of Vulcan. The slayers - who would originallyhave been a religious rather than political group - concealed their crime,carrying away the pieces beneath their robes, and according ro anorhersource, burying them in the earth. While it cannot be shown that the vic-tim was eaten raw after being torn apart, it is perhaps a permissible as-sumption. In any case there is plainly a sacrificial rite lurking beneath thesuperimposed political context. Such archaic traditions as these appear tohave formed the background for the rites of the Salii, which continued,although scarce understood, into the days of the Emperors.-the SaliiAccording to Classical tradition the rites of Cybele did not enrer Romeuntil the Punic Wars; even then no Roman citizens could be her priestsuntil the time of Claudius. However a college of priests known as Saliiexisted in Rome from the earliest times, whose activities are stronglyreminiscent of the Curetes. There were two colleges of Salii, of which theoldest will be examined here. The Salii were priests of Mamers, an archaicforrn of Mars god of war, who had a very dlfferent character to the Ares ofthe Classical Greeks. Their name appears to come from words meaningleaping and dancing which were required features of their rites. Accordingto tradition they were instituted by King Numa, whose name is synon-ymous with archaic rites and magical practices, in 7go ece. Their dury"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"was to take care of sacred shields known as Ancylia. In his reign a singleoriginal Ancyle was said to have fallen from heaven. The nymph Egeriapredicted that this shield would make the nation possessing it dominantover all peoples of the world. Since the furure glory and power of Romewas connected with this shield, Numa had eleven duplicates rnade. Thiswas, according to tradition, performed by an armourer named MamuriusVeturius. This armourer appears to be synonymous with an ancient formor Mars, known in other parrs of Italy, named Mamers. The Ancylia werekept in the temple of Mars, and the Salii were instituted to take care ofthem. It was the custom, on the occasion of declarations of war, for theSalii to furiously shake these shields, summoning Mars to the aid ofRoman arms. They were also responsible for rites involving a ritual dance,which took a significant form, to be examined shortly.These priests were twelve in number; rhree of these were olficers overthe remaining nine. The officers were called Praesul, Vates and Magister,and it is worth examining these titles. Praesul means dancer, while sirni-lar words involve leading or going frrst, Vates signifies a prophet, also apoet or bard; while Magister indicates the chief or director. Some detailsof their duties are known, which with the titles themselves provide suf-ficient information to deduce the following. The Praesul was in charge ofthe dancers; the Vates was a soorhsayer who interpreted omens attendingtheir rites, probably he also both performed and led invocations; and theMagister directed the rites as leader of the college.All of the Salii were yourlg men - both of whose parenrs had to be alive- from patrician families. The office was highly presrigious, and the homeof the college was on the Palatine Hill. The usual costume of the Salii wasa short scarlet tunic of which only the edges were seen, abronze breast-plate concealing the rest; alarge purple coloured belt was worn about thewaist, fastened with brass buckles; and a scarlet cloak. on their headswere worn round caps with spikes, such a cap being known as an apex.In the right hand was carried a rod, or on occasion a spear, while swordswere also worn. In the left was a shield, roughly oval in shape, the edgesdrawn inwards at half its length so ir resembled a'figure of eighr'similar toancient Mycenaean shields. Some descriptions describe them as dancing"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"in full armour. This suggests that greaves, plate armour for the shins, u'erealso worn; also that the caps, cerrainly of a martial rype, were helmets.Their rites were begun witl-r a sacrifice on the Palatine Hill, frorn whichthe Vates would have drawn omens. Afterwards they wenr in proces-sion in the streets, dancing in measured motions. At some points theywould dance singularly, at others all together, while musical insrrumentswere played before them. They bore their bodies in various positions,and struck their shields with the rods. A feature of this dance was an ex-tremely vigorous triple stamp; so vigorous indeed that it was wondered ifbridges could withstand it. They performed an ancienr song in honour ofJupiter and Ceres, also toJanus who was named as god of gods. They sangalso in honour of Mamurius Veturius.In this they were accompanied by achorus of similarly attired virgins, known as Salia.The rite of the Salii commenced on the 6rst of March, ar one time thefirst month of the year, which takes irs name from Mars. The dance, in-volving leaping in the air, was connecred with fertility as well as war. Theheight of such dances, which are widely known, is intended to stimulatethe growth of corn. The corn goddess Ceres (Greek Demeter) was amongthose chiefly invoked, and in addition the 6rst of March was also thefeast day ofJuno Lucina, goddess of childbirth. These rites continued fortwenty-four successive days, each night stopping at a particular'mansion'where the shields were kept. There were also halts during the day at vari-ous temples and altars. The costume, songs and other aspecrs of the cel-ebration were extremely archaic and hardly understood in late Republicantimes, let alone the Imperial period. On the fourth of March there wasa celebration, involving a chariot race, known as Mamuralia; the festivalof Mamers. On this day a skin, presumably stretched over a frame, wasbeaten with staves. This was said to be specifically to imitate the sound ofthe armourers hammering.The religious festivals of this period appear to have been partially in-corporated into the later Christian festival of Easter. Tl-re last nine days ofthe celebration were attended by a fast, which was broken on the rwenry-fifth for the joyful festival known as Hilaria. This day was known as rheFeriae Marti, and it has frequently been suggested that it is the origin of"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"the celebration known today as Mardi Gras. The religious feasts and en-tertainments organised by the Salii were proverbially rich and sumptuous.These facts are well enough known, though the resemblance of the Saliito the Curetes has been little remarked upon. This being so it is interest-ing to note that March z4't', the last day of fasting before the Hilaria, wasan extremely significant date in the cult of Cybele. Known as the Dayof Blood, it was typicalLy upon this day that the ritual self-mutilation ofCybele's priests, the Galli, took place.The resemblance of the Salii to the Curetes is striking, and was rec-ognised by the ancients. In Thomas Taylor's translation of the LIymns oJOrpbeus, that to the Curetes begins with the Line: Brass-beating Salians,ministers of Mars.There were also ninejunior Salii, equal in number to theCuretes. In addition the sacred shield is said to have fallen from heaven.This resembles the descent of Cybele's sacred stone, and the descent ofthe god Hephastus, to the earth. The connection with metals of thesetwo, and the armourer god Mamers, can hardly be coincidental. This re-semblance is explicable if the Salii originated with a migration from AsiaMinor prior to the rise of Rome and the adoption of Olympian Hellenicfonns.It is interesting also to consider the complexity of the god Mamers. Hecombines the functions of ferdlity, working iron, and of war; while thename Mars itself is derived from roots indicating boundaries, as survive inour word margin. He was also a protector of flocks, as such gods usuallyare. Such varied functions suggest strongly that he is akin to the ThracianHero; far older than the separation of these functions among separatedeities."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Samothrace and CyzicusAt the suggestion of Orpheus, after their stay on Lemnos the crew travelto Samothrace. Here they receive initiation and learn something of thesecret rites. This allows them to sail on with greatr.r confidence, pardyno doubt because the Cabirs are protectors of those travelling the seas.A more subtle implication is that their knowledge of the rituals is an as-set in the performance of many key tasks that face them. Older refer-ences show that the Samothracian episode is not an innovation on thepart of this author. There are major indications that Apollonius was aninitiate of the Mysteries, including those of Samothrace and Crete. It isimportant to bear in mind that the Mysteries in Crete did rrot involvesecrecy. There are strong indications that this pennitted Apollonius andother writers to use substitute terms in alluding to other Mysteries. Someof the apparent confusion or syncretisrn in the literary sources, wl-rerebydifferent Mysteries appear to be conflated, likely derives from this circum-stance. Despite the apparent reticence Apollonius exhibits regarding theMysteries of Samothrace, the subtext of his epic would have been entirelycomprehensible to initiates arnong his audience. Such significant detailsof the subtext emerge in the very nexc episode of the adventure, whichaccordingly requires an extended commentary.After Samothrace, the Argonauts come to the Thracian isiand ofCyzictrs on the coast of Mysia. Here they are warmly received by theprince, also named Cyzicus. On leaving they are obliged to return by nightdue to a storm. They do not recognise it as the place they recently left, norare they recognised, they are immediately attacked in an apparent caseof mistaken identity. They do battle with their former hosts, kiiling theprince and many of his attendants. At dawn the tragedy is revealed andthey and the islanders spend three days wailing and tearing out their hairin grief. The horror is added to when the slain prince's virgin bride-to-behangs herself in grief.The ritual aspects of this episode so far should be apparent enough.However it is worthwhile pointing out the changes in roles the Argonautsact out here. They have been friends of the prince, then his enemies, and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"then his mourners. That this part of the epic represents a sacred dramais an unavoidable conclusion. The participants in such a rite would havebeen goetes,likely including mourners from Mysia.Bad weather then kept them at Cyzicus for twelve days. Keeping watchby night Mopsus the soothsayer saw a bird called a halcyon over Jason'ssleeping head, singing sweetly. The bird then flew to the figurehead ofthe Argo and perched upon it. Mopsus - who understood the art ofaugury by birds - then woke Jason, who was wrapped in feeces on theshore like Pythagoras at his Cretan initiation. He predicted a change inweather after arite in honour of Rhea (the Cretan equivalent of PhrygianCybele). Oxen were then driven up mount Dindymum for sacrifice. Fromthere Apollonius adds that Thrace appeared so close it seemed they couldtouch it, despite the fact the mountain is described as wooded. An ancientvine was cut down to form an image of the goddess (probably a form ofthe Palladium), this work was performed by Argus who had shaped theprow of the Argo. This image they set up on a rocky eminence, shaded bymighty oaks. An altar of stones was then formed nearby. Crowned withoak wreaths they then began the sacrifrcial rites. Cybele (in the text calledby the Cretan name Rhea, but also Dindymian Motber, most worshipful,who dwells in Pbrygia) was then invoked, but not alone. Two othet fig-ures are mentioned, semi-disguised by epithets: and with her, Titias andCyllenos. For tbese two are singled out as dispensers of doom and assessorsto the Idaean Mother from the many ldaean Dactyls of Crete. They u'ereborne in the Dictaean cave by tbe l{ympb Ancbiale as she clutclted tbe earth ofOaxos with both her hands.Oaxos is the name of a Cretan town, where according to tradition thefounder of Cyrene in Libya was born. Oaxes is a river of Crete, ^pparentLynamed after a son of Apollo and Anchiale.Titias, or Tityos, is the name of one of the giants born to Gaia. Bornunderground, he sprang from the earth at birth. A 6gure with a similarname also appears as an incidental character in the legends of Heraclesdeeds in the region of Mysia. There are several variants of his myth, fromwhich it appears he was originally a chthonian oracular hero, similar oridentical to Python of Delphi. Imprisoned in Tartarus, his body covered"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"nine acres, and two vultures or serpenrs perpetually consumed his liver,which renewed itself according to the moons phases. In this he resemblesPrometheus, who was thus punished for giving men rhe gift of fire. Theconnections with the chthonic Rhea and with Prometheus are apt for aDactyl. A further discussion of Tityos follows this analysis of evenrs onthe island Cyzicos.Cyllenos is likely a form of Cyllenius, a title of Hermes indiscriminatelyapplied to anything which he invented or presided over. The image ofHermes on Mount Cyllene was archaic, and resembled the ithyphallic im-ages of the Cabirs at Samothrace. The pructice of erecting phallic hermsin honour of Hermes at crossroads was inherited by the Greeks from thePelasgians. From this it appears that Anchiale is a title of the ancient andnear genderless mother-goddess, while Titias and Cyllenos represenr amasculine pair associated with her. Together they form a trinity; fromthis trinity lesser Cabirs or Dactyls are produced (the fingers of Anchialein the earth produce the ten Dactyls).Immediately after the passage naming them there is mention of a sub-stantial fire, but there has been no apparenr menrion of its being lit. Titiasand Cyllenos may represenr two Cabirs equivalenr to the Dioscuri, as-sociated with ritual fire, which is a Mystery in itself, It might be arguedthat Castor and Pollux were among the Argonauts and rheir role in light-ing the fire may just as easily have been quietly omitted, unconnecred rothe Dactyls. However, there is nothing ro prevenr apparenr duplication ofroles in the accumulative development of epic poetry. More to the poinrperhaps, Castor and Pollux may well have lit the fire. Then, in doing sothe two Dactyls are thereby represented and invoked by two twins amongthe Argonauts. This, as will appear later, is a feature of important relatedcult practices.Jason continued the rite, pouring libations on the bLazing sacrifice, andbeseeching the goddess to send the storms elsewhere. Orpheus meanwhilecommanded the young men ro move around the fire, dressed in full ar-mour, in a high-stepping dance. They beat their shields with their swordsto drown out the cries of mourning for the slain prince. Apollonius tells usthat this is why the Phrygians honour Cybele with tambourine and drum"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"to this day; although in reality the tympanum was a Greek innovation inher cult. In this way Jason, and indeed Orpheus, is made responsible forthe foundation of the rites of the goddess at Cyzicus and in Phrygia.The invocation of the goddess is described as flawless, and is answeredby abundant signs. The trees miraculously fruited, the bare earth sproutedwith tender grass, animals left their lairs and appeared to them with wag-ging tails. More than this, the previously waterless mountain suddenlyproduced a gushing spring. That this quenched more than thirst is im-plicit in the blood guilt Jason and his companions have brought uponthemselves by the slaying of their hosts. The subtext here implies thatthese waters purifiedJason and his companions of their former misdeeds.Just as the earth is renovated by this rite, whose seasonal implications areapparent in the signs, so a similar renovation applies to the souls of theparticipants.On the subject of participants, from the point where Mopsus sees thebird of good omen, the only other Argonauts mentioned by name areJason, Argus and Orpheus, while Castor and Pollux may or may not beassumed to be present in a secret capacity, All of these have distinct roles,which can be assumed to exclude them from the armoured dance. Thedancing youths are not given names, and what they represent here is notthemselves but mythic and ritual figures. Here, as elsewhere, they rcpre-sent multiple Curetes and Corybantes.The precise timing of the ritual is not entirely clear from Apollonius'account. It is safe to say that the preparations for the ritual take placeby day. Equally it appears that the feast went on through the night. Theinterlude takes place on Bear Mountain and A NSbf on Bear Mountainis the name of a powerful piece of music concerned with magical themes.Herodotus refers to the same rites, and makes clear that they took placeat night. He also refers to the wearing of twin images by rhe participants,which likely represenr Tityos and Cyllenos, and resembles cults of theDioscuri elsewhere. The rites of the Argonauts are concluded by a feaston the mountain in honour of the goddess, in whose praise they also sing.At dawn - almost needless to say - the strong winds have abated and theyare able to depart."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"TityosAnd in Homer, in his Necromancy, odysseus makes rhis relarion toAlcinous, of rityos rhe dear darling of rhe earth, we saw rhe bodyftretchd nine furlongs forth and on each side of whom a vulrure greatGnawing his bowel...Cornelius Agrippa, Occuk Philosophy Book 3, ch xrrThe mythology of Tityos, and his original narure and identity, like thatof other archaic 6gures, has ro be recovered from fragments in the mythsof others.

Theevidence suggesrs thar he was an oracular hero, of the type associatedwith such oracles; a deified king and son of the goddess, on the Thracianmodel, in his chthonic role.other accounts of his parentage make Tiryos the son of Zeusand Elara,daughter of orchomenus the king and ancestor of the Minyans.

The Dactyls, among whom Tityos apPears to beone of the principals, are also associated with the origins of 6re amongmortals.There is another tradition concerning him, which, at first glance, con-tains peculiar contradictions. Tityos - supposedly a villain and victim inthe Olympian scheme of things - had a temple and altar on the island ofEuboea. At Euboea, according to Homer, the son oJ' Earth was also vis-ited by Rhadamanthus, whether or not this was at the temple the poetdoes not say. Why would Rhadamanthus visit Tityos, at his temple orotherwisei To understand this it is necessary to examine the Parentageof Rhadamanthus, who was a son of Europa. The legends of Europa arein themselves complex, with no less than five versions. Close examina-tion shows close connections between the 6rst and frfth. There is Europathe daughter of Tityos, who is the mother of Euphemus the Argonaut byPoseidon.Then there is Europa the daughter of Agenor/Phoenix who wascarried off by Zeus, and became mother of Rhadamanthus, Minos andSarpedon. The most likely explanation of the journey of Rhadamanthusto the tomb of Tityos is that he was visiting the shrine of his grandfather,and not, as has been anachronistically suggested, travelling in his capacityof InfernalJudge while still alive.Tiryos is thus the grandfather of two judges in the underworld, and ofan Argonaut. So far from Tityos being a crirninal, k appears that Zeus isguilry of abducting his daughtea who is also the mother of two of threeInfernal Judgesl The evidence suggests that Tityos was originally an im-portant chthonic deity, rather than a notable captive of Hades.

He is an earth borngiant, associated wirh the goddess to whom the Delphic oracle was origi-nally dedicated. As a giant it would be appropriate ro represenr Tityos -like Aegaeon - with legs formed from enormous snakes. When invoked attheir tombs heroes also frequently took ophidian form, the snake havingpowerfully chthonic significance throughout Greek religion. As seen wirhAegaeon giants could be identified - like heroes - with ancient burialmounds. Hero cults also attached ro ancienr Mycenaean tombs, and therewas a tomb of Tityos on the island of Euboea. Tityos may also be a vari-ant form of the monstrous Python, who Apollo is said to have slain atDelphi. Gathering these threads together Tityos has rhe appearance of anoracular hero.Mysi,tThe next landfall of the Argonauts was i' the land of the Mysians, re-nowned as funeral mourners. It is of course from the Greek term for suchmourners - goes - that Goetia takes irs name. Apollonius menrions sev-eral landmarks which lend rhe area and rhe episode an armospheric set-ting and underline the imporrance of what follows. That he does so quitedeliberately, as a so-called Orphic writer and an educated Hellene intepested in Mystery religions and chthonic cults, is importanr ro recognise.Significant events are to take place here, and it is necessary ro consider thelocation very carefully in order for us to appreciate them fully.Apollonius tells us first that it is near the mouth of the River Rhyndacusand the great burial mound of Aegaeon, close to Phrygia. The Rhyndacuswas a major river of Asia Minor, and has its source on Mount Dindymus,sacred to Cybele like that from which the Argonauts had lately departed.As such it undoubtedly was connected with a river god, while irs sourceon the sacred mounrain would have endowed it with considerable irn-portance. Ancient inscriptions in the area point to religious and culrural"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAdilferences, as well as affinities, with the neighbouring Phrygians. Amongthese are dedications to Hecate and her near equivalent Artemis. TheArtemis in question bears torches in token of her underworld role. Amongthese is Artemis Thermaea, a healing deity of a hot and sulphurous spring.Interesting too is the local syncretism of Asclepius, a healer god and sonof Apollo, with Sabazius, a form of Dionysus as son of Cybele. This is anatural association considering the snake symbolism both share, but alsotells us that Sabazius was not simply an orgiastic deity but a healer. BothHecate and Sabazius are obviously closely connected with the Dionysianand Goetic themes explored here. It is therefore not surprising to 6ndthem prominent in Mysian cults.Another mythic figure of the region is a legendaryPhrygian king namedManes, also known as Men, In the garbled Greek form he becomes, likeAttis, an entirely divine figure, being the son of Zeus and the Earth god-dess. Although called Gaia by the Greeks his mother was really Cybele,and Man Tyrannus was a title of Attis even in her Roman cult. Althoughprobably a separate figure Men was frequently combined with Attis. Hehad lunar and underworld roles and was immensely popular throughoutrural Asia Minor. He presided over the growrh of plants and productiv-ity of animals, as well as over rural burial grounds.Judging from the localinscriptions Men became associated with a form of Apollo, and formed amale female pair with Hecare. One of his sons was named Acmon, whichis a name of one of the Dactyls, although other connections also attach.Although Acmon is generally translated as anvil it is widely accepted rhatit anciently meant thunderbolt; judging from various associations thismay originally have been a meteoric stone.The burial mound of Aegaeon is another significant feature. Aegaeon isthe third of the Giants, the others being Gyges or Gyes and Cottus. Theywere sons of Uranus and Gaea, known as the Uranids. They are describedas huge monsters with a hundred arms and fifty heads, with serpenrsrather than legs. Aegaeon is also known as Briareus, which Homer ex-plains by the device of making the 6rst his name among men and the latterthat among gods.

This naturally makes Aegaeon a resident of the underworld.Later accounts confuse him with the giants who made war upon olympus,and still others describe him as a marine deity of the Aegean Sea.There are two incidents to be examined in detail in this interlude inMysia, for which the scene is now abundantly set. I shall ler Apolloniusdescribe the events that immediately followed rheir landing:The Mysians, inhabitants of rhat land, hofpitably welcomed rhem,giving them in their need provisions and sheep and abundant wine.Hereupon some brought dried wood, others from the meadows leavesfor beds which they gathered in abundance for ftrewing, whilst otherswere twirling fire-fticks to get fire orhers again were mixing wine inthe bowl and making ready the fea$t that would follow rhe sacrificeafter nightfall ro Apollo Ecbasir-rs.This is apparently a mundane enough scene; the Argonauts are campednear to a river in Mysia, performing various tasks. However they havecome here from a sacred mountain, also a ritual site, where as noted no ref-erence to fire-making appears in Apollonius'texr. Here the Argonaurs areportrayed preparing for a ritual, which strangely enough is not describedin the story as it unfolds. There appears to be a thread inrerconnectingthese two incidents. It is interesting ro ponder whether Apollonius, whenhe omitted the fire lighting secrer in one episode and the ritual in theother, was making an in joke undersrood by initiates of the Mysteries.In a description of ritual 6re making elsewhere in this study ir is men-tioned that in some contexts at least it takes place apart from the oth-er participants.

A beautiful yourh named Hylas, broughton the expedition by Heracles, wenr into the woods in search of water.Meanwhile the nymphs of the place were preparing for a night dance inhonour of Artemis. One of them, about to emerge from a spring, sawHylas approaching. Smitten by his beauty she drew him into the water tobe her lover. Later Heracles, convinced the Mysians knew somerhing ofhis beloved's disappearance, forced them to search for the yourh.Also mentioned by Apollonius in the locale is Mount Arganthon,which, Propertius tells us, srood above the pool beloved by Thyniannymphs. Mount Arganthon was on the borders of Bithynia and Mysia.A nymph named Arganthone mourned Rhesus, a Thracian hero and thegod'of a Bithynian river.Arganthone would appear to be a mountain god-dess of the Cybele type, and Rhesus her hero lover the ancestor of a localThracian dynasty. The pair may have resembled Cybele and Mcn.Both these stories were apparcnt.Iy put forward to explain the annualsearch by Mysian priests for the lover of Cybele. Mysians in Boeotia werestill practicing this rite in Roman times. The fame of the dirge singers ofMysia in antiquity earned them a mention in The Persians of Aeschylus,the famous Mysian cry which he mentions is the calling for Llylas. Theconjuration of the dead or rhe rites of a hero cult, which appear togetherin the drama of Aeschylus, plainly benefited from Mysian involvemenr.After these events Heracles, distraught by his loss, went search-ing for Hylas and was separated from the crew. Another crew member,Polyphemus, who shares this name with a Cyclops in Homer's Odyssey,could also not be found. Unable to find them Jason departed withoutthem, and an argument broke our concerning his motives in abandoningHeracles. This was resolved by the appearance of a prophetic sea-god,who told them of Heracles destiny.

The Dactyls, whose originis in Phrygra, werc also associated with Mystery cults on the island ofCrete and elsewhere. The intimate relationship between the Cretan andPhrygian cults is demonstrated by the existence of a sacred Mount Idain both locations, among other connections. However, despite the widefame of Crete, achieved partly by its prominent place in rhe myth andcult of Zeus, the original Ida, and the Dactyls horne, was in Phrygia. TheCretans nevertheless claimed the Idaean Dacryls for their Mount Ida. Thecult as it developed there was extremely influential on the Classical forrnof Greek religion. This could hardly have failed to be the case, since itinvolved the birth of Zeus, the greatest god of Olympian religion. Yet,there is litrle evidence of rnining and smelting in Crete, as opposed to theimporring of copper frorn Cyprus &c. The best ancienr authorities, andthe extensive modern evidence, indicate decisively that the Dactyls origi-nal association was with Mount Ida in Asia Minor. This is important asit detaches the origins of the Dactyls from the later developmenr of thecult of Zeus. Thus it is easier to focus on, and understand, their earlierconnection with the Mother of the Gods.Near Mount Ida were the town and mountain named Gargarus. Thisregion was fbrnous for its fertility and named for an ancienr king calledGargoris. He was credited with discovering honey and bee keeping. Hewished to destroy his daughter's son - tl-re fruit of an illicit union - butafter re;reated failed attempts rnade hirn his heir.

Cybele was worshippedthere, and in consequence bore the title Anderina.The city of Magnesia beside Mount Sipylus, near Smyrna, possessed agreat shrine of Cybele. Of three cities called by this narne, this Magnesiawas a Lydian town on the river Meander. Here too the magnet is saidro have been discovered, and it is frorn nearby Magnesia that it derivedits name. An interesting alternative tradition credits the discovery to a"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"shepherd of Mount lda, named Magnes. While walking over a mine hewas bound to the earth by the iron nails in his shoes. It was also said thathe was a slave of Medea, who changed him into a magnet.It had formerlybeen called Ceraunius, rhe name of a child of Niobe killed by Apollo.Niobe incidentally was also said to be the mother of Pelasgus, an ancestorfigure from whom the Pelasgians took their name. Called by the RomansMagnesia ad Sipylum, its temple of Cybele was famous and possessedof important privileges. Sipylus is a metal bearing mountain, which wassaid to have produced brass. In the time of the Romans medals in honourof Vulcan were struck here, and it appears to have been a great centreof metal working and the manufacture of weapons and armour. Nearbythere was also an ancient statue on Mount Coddinus. This statue wasassociated with Cybele. The Greeks however called it Niobe and attrib-uted it to Broteus, the son of Tantalus. In fact the carving was of Hittiteorigin, but it is important to note that Tantalus was the father of Pelops,whose shoulder had been eaten by another goddess of fertiliry associatedwith the Mystery cults, narnely Demeter. The likeiihood of Chalybes, orDactyls, being present here is extremely strong.Ephesus amongst its mountains was a major centre of the worship ofCybele from at least the tenth century scr. The North Syrian cult ofAstarte, Artemis to the Greeks, Diana to the Romans, was built uponhers in later times, but the ecstatic festival known as the Ephesia was stillcelebrated in her honour in the Roman period. The priests of Cybeleappear to have originally been ethnically distinct from the main popula-tion, being probably supplied by native Chalybes. The waning of her cultmight represenr the shrinking of the hill tribes. Even so, the high priestsof Arternis at Ephesus were also eunuchs (Megabyzi or Megalobyzi).Thismay indicate either their original connection with the more ancient priest-hood of Cybele, or the reverse, the influence of other cults upon that ofCybele. In either case the magical traditions so strongly associated withthe city are rooted in the lore of the Dacryls.zt6"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE FOUNI)F,RS OII THE N,IYSTERIIlSClbeleThe origin of the cult of Cybele, as known in the Classical period, was q'iththe Phrygians who in the r3'l' century invaded Asia Minor from Thrace.Both the Greeks and the Romans were aware of these orienral origins,which rendered it controversial despite its widespread acceprance whichwas earlier and more extensive than other imported cults. While Phrygianand ultimately Thracian in origin, the cult, and the goddess around whichit centred, absorbed elements from the religions and iconography of theHittite, Neo-Hittite and [Jrartian cultures. However, the myth and culrof Cybele contained highly primitive elements, which pufting all ancientand modern Occidental prejudice aside, nevertheless distinguished herworship from all others. Here we shall review and partially correct theGreek account of her nature. This is necessary to understand the impor-tant place she occupied in ecstatic religion in that sphere. The nature ofthe Great Goddess of Thracian religion, where Cybele originated, will beexamined in the fifth book. Curiously,Lynn Roller, author of the most upto date examination of the Phrygian goddess currently avallabl,e, omittedthis entirely from her study. Her example cannot be followed here, as theThracian background underlines the importance of Cybele in relation toour theme.I am nevertheless indebted to her for clearly differentiating theGraco-Roman and Phrygian forms of the goddess.On the most basic level her distinguishing features include a strong as-sociation with mountains, and with predators. These included lions orleopards, which influenced her Greek and Roman cult, but the hawkand falcon were more common in Phrygia. While controversial, WalterBurkert calls the association of her iconography with the images of theNeolithic Great Goddess of Catal Huyuk, who is also associated withpredators, inesistible.Accounts of her eunuch priests are fairly common knowledge but mayhave been a later development under Eastern influence, having no coun-terpart in Thracian religion. The subject has been greatly exaggerated bythe growth of this class of priest in the Roman era.

Roller isprobably correct in ascribing its origins to a requirement for celibacy inan elite caste, It is true that there were strong ascetic elements in someThracian religious expression; in addition Eleusian hierophants, who hadThracian connections, temporarily suppressed sexual urges with henbaneointment. Oriental cults such as that of Atargatis may have influencedPhrygian practice; the date of the innovation cannot presently be ascer-tained.According to Pausanias, Cybele was formed from the seed of Zeus,falling on the rock Agdus, hence her name Agdistis (properly Angdistis).Another form of the myth involves a failed seduction of Cybele by Zeus,in which some of his sperm falls upon a rock, forming an entity knownas Agdistis. Despite the variants, and the fact that these myths are Greekrather than Phrygian, there can be no doubting the equivalence of Agdistisand Cybele. On 6rst appearing Agdistis was a monstrous being, at oncemale and female, enormously strong and ferocious. The monster, a terrorto men and gods, rampaged across the country causing great destruction.At last Bacchus poured a great. quantity of very strong neat wine into afountain favoured by Agdistis. Upon drinking this powerful brew themonster fell into a deep asleep. Bacchus then tightly tied its male organs toatree with a rope formed of bristles. When Agdistis awoke and leapt up,the phallus was ripped o6 attended by a great fow of blood from whichgrew the 6rst almond tree. From then on Agdistis was purely female, butretained her colossal proportions. This legend also bears comparison withthe Egyptian legend of Sekhmet, a lion headed goddess, who began todestroy mankind until tricked into drinking an enormous quantity of redbeer, which she had mistaken for blood.The birth of Attis, who was to become the consort of Cybele, is inti-mately associated with this myth. The blood of Agdistis had caused atree,identified either as an almond or a pomegranate, and a local nymph hadbecome pregnant either by placing one of its fruits in her lap, whereuponit disappeared, or directly inside herself. Her father Sangarius, a local rivergod, attempted to starve her, but she was fed by Cybele. When Attis wasborn Sangarius had him exposed on a mounrain and left to die, but he"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"was fed and raised by a goat. This legend has some afflnities with the boi'-hood of Ze,ts himself, who was fed by the goat Amalthea. As Attis greu'to manhood Agdistis grew enamoured of him, and accompanied him onhunts, presenting him with game. Their relationship was disapproved ofby his farher, Midas, the Phrygian king of Pessinos, (himself the son andlover of Cybele). He arranged a marriage for his son, and closed the citygates. Agdistis, undeterred by this precaution rose from beneath the citywalls, which she raised on her head. Her intervention was, in this ver-sion, ro avert the ill-fortune she foresaw was to follow if Attis married.However the marriage-hymn had already been sung and Attis became in-sane. In his madness he castrated himself beneath a pine tree, presentinghis mutilated organs to Agdistis before he expired.Zeus, whose part inthis story under that name is likely to be an interpolation, was appealed toby Agdistis. He would not restore Attis to life, but preserved him from de-cay and, a curious detail, kept his little finger constantly moving. Agdististhereupon created a cult around the tomb of Attis at Pessinos, with cas-trated priests to serve the shrine,This barbaric and powerful myth, resembling an erotic nightmare, hasall the qualities of primal myth lacking in Classical Graco-Roman stories.Disturbing on a literal Level, it cannot be doubted that it preserves manyfeatures of great antiquity. On the other hand this myth involves consider-able distortion of the original Phrygian context; Cybele had no androgy-nous form but was female from the beginning. More importantly, therewas no eunuch god Attis in Asia Minor until the Graco-Roman formsof the cult were re-imported to their original home. There is no Phrygianimage of Cybele in which any kind of consort is depicted. The name Attiswas inirially associated with the cult for two reasons. Firstly it was a vetycommon name in the region, secondly and more importantly it was ^ dy'nastic name of the Phrygian kings who formerly had a priestly role withinthe Phrygian cult. The confusion in the Greek mind may have arisen oncontact with the cult after the fall of the Phrygian kingdom; confusingpriests named Attis with the former kings honoured in funerary cults.Nevertheless, according to the Greeks, Agdistis, also found as Agdestisor Agdisrus, was the name of a mountain in Phrygia,where Attis was bur-"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":")PHIAied. It was also a surname or title of Cybele. The colossal size of the god-dess in the myth may indicate the indigenous connecrion of the goddesswith the mountainous wilderness. On the orher hand both her size andoriginal androgynous nature are attributes of other primitive goddesses,remembered by the Classical Greeks. Their myths frequently involve suf-fering acts of violence. This, taken with their association with mountaincaves, is at least pardy explicable by an ancient association with mining.M1 sti c s a n d Me tttllur gi s t sThe Dactyls were said by Ephoros to have founded the Mysteries ofSamothrace. The Cabirs of Samoth race are, according to varied interpre-tations, either intimately associated or identical with the Dactyls. Othersimilar groups - under other names - are associated with archaic rites inthese and other places. Strabo, whose importance ro rhis study cannot beunderstated, summarised the matter as follows (Geography rc3.7):Some represent the Corybantes, the Cabeiroi, the Idaean DaCtyls andthe Telchines as identical with the Curetes. Others represenr them asall kinsmen of one another and differentiate only certain small mattersin which they differ in re$pe& to one anorher. Speaking approximarelyand in general, rhey represenr rhem, one and all, as a kind of infpiredpeople and as subjeCt to Bacchic frenzy; and, in the guise of minifters,as infpiring terror at the celebration of the sacred rites by means ofwar-dances, accompanied by uproar and noise and cymbals and drumsand arms, and also by flute and outcry.

It is complexbecause a variety of terms, names and locations associated with one topicare being compared. The topic is the origins and nature of the Mysteryreligions of the Greek world.These Mysteries perpetuated traditions and practices far older than theClassical Olyrnpian state religion. Some were of such extreme antiquitythat their origins and meanings frequently defied the scholarly efforts ofClassical Greek culture. To illustrate, the beginnings of Mycenaean cul-ture preceded Classical Greece by as great a period as the Classical pe-riod preceded the Crusades. The beginnings of Minoan culture precededClassical Greece by as great a period as the Classical period precedes ourown times.In other words, while it is common to speak of Ancient Greece,the beginnings of Greek culture were already ancient in Classical times.Behind the distance of time and the confusion of terms, names, titlesand locations, the overall situation can be outlined as follows. At the mostimportant and archaic cult centres of the Greek world rites of the greatgorls were performed. At any such particular centre the great gods gener-ally consisted of a group, of say three to four archaic deities. Often theywere essentially more primitive forms of figures integrated - in Homericform - into the'Olympian' religion of the polis. A representative groupwould be Demeter, Persephone and Hades, with Zeus as an alternativeto the last named god. The local myth frequently included, among otherelements: a death, a descent to the underworld and a birth or rebirth onthe part of one or other of such a group of gods. Alongside this group alsoappeared various attendants. These included witnesses and subordinatecharacters involved in various key stages (one might compare the Magi at"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"the birth ofJesus). The ritual roles of various participants in the celebra-tion of these rites corresponded - naturally enough - with the mythicactivities of some of these characters. Much as actors are occasionally con-fused with the characters rhey play, there arises confusion berween thegods, their mythical attendants and the actual participants in the ritual.This is not to suggest that these rites consisted of Mystery plays or dra-matic re-enactments, which does not seem always to have been the case.Nevertheless, at the founding of these Mysteries, the celebrants either in-cluded or consisred of the goetes.In this way the goetes were both the founders and the original celebrantsof the most important and prestigious religious fesdvals and celebrarionsin the ancient Greek world. This places the goetes ar rhe very centre of ar-chaic Greek culture; long prior to the devaluation of the term wirh the riseof the polis and Homeric Olympianism beginning in the B'r' century. Oneof the most important celebradons the Dactyls are credited with found-ing was the Olympic Games. Some ancient authors place this at r+53 Bcr-,others credit the Dactyl named Heracles with instituring them in ozzecp. (Another tradition attributes rhe foundation of the games to Pelops,a name which will be encounrered many times in the next chapter; but theDactyls are associated with a foot race and Pelops with chariots). Srraboobjects to these dates on rhe grounds that Homer would have made lnen-tion of them. This objecrion is countered by others who claim they werelong negle cted, after their first period of importance, unril revived in 8B+ece.In fact however the Zeus shrine at Olympia dates to the ro'l'cenruryecp. There is significance to the traditional dates, whether or nor they tru-ly mark the first olympiad.r+53 nce places the Dactyls in the Mycenaeanage, near the end of Minoan culrure, which is certainly striking and sup-ported by other evidence.Is there any way in which these Dactyls can be associated with non-mythical Persons and their traditionsi The answer lays in the occupationof the mountains of Anatolia, the Caucasus and Carpathians by special-ised metal working rribes. The mythological Dactyls are readily idend-fiable with such historical tribes. The tribes in question are referred toin the sources either as Halizones or Chalybes. Their name is closely"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"related to the Greek word for iron, cbalybos; the metal of the Chalybes.The same term is the root of the name of King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,(the legends concerning which are nowadays rhought to reflect the in-fuence of Sarmatian cavalry serrled in Britain by the Romans). In thenineteenth century the Besh Parmak or'Five Finger'mountains of Turkeywere worked by gypsy metal smiths. The Greek name for these moun-tains, until recent times, was Pente Dactyloi or Five Fingers. Undoubtedlythe Turkish name is a continuation of this ancient designation. It is fromthese mountains that the Chalybes, who discovered iron there, acquiredthe name Dactyls.It is important to recognise in the Chalybes a specialised caste involvedin the working of metals. Castes of this type are a recognised historicaland ethnological phenomenon, occurring almost worldwide. Throughoutthe history of mankind, the earliest specialists in metal working are aL-most invariably of this type. The existence of such castes is not only tobe sought in the distant past; in some regions of the world they continueto the present day. In the medieval period, and in the period of Europeancolonial expansion, such a caste was represented by the Gypsies; specialis-ing principally in the working of copper.The metals first worked by the Chalybes were copper, silver, and gold;brass and bronze followed, and finally iron. These they mined, smelted,and worked, producing tools, weapons and armour. Their descendants, orsuccessors of other ethnic groups, carried on these metal-working laboursuntil recent times. The metal-working tribes in Asia Minor may includethe oldest known populations; and are prominent in the history and my-thology of the region. The entire mountain system of Asia Minor is richin metals, including very major deposits of hematite iron. These ores arereadily accessible on the surface, Extensive Literary, archaeological and an-ecdotal evidence makes plain that the smelting of iron ore in Asia Minorwas propagated by mountain tribes. The mountains were occupied in thehistorical period by tribes engaged in smeltin g, that were called Chalybes.Similar activities in more recent times continued in sites associated withboth the Chalybes and the Dactyls. The chief points to be kept in mindare: the connection of the Dactyls with metal working and fire; their rela-"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"tion, and that of the other mythical figures associated with them, with thecult of the mother of the gods; their association with a god of fire, whoseassistants they were; and their involvement with magic and Mystery cultsthroughout the region.It is not my business to decide to which ethnic group the Chalybes be-longed. In the period which chiefy concerns us rhey were closely associ-ated with both the Scythians and Thracians. It is also known that metalworking tribes were present in the Balkan and Danube regions from re-mote prehistory onwards. On the other hand the Hittites undoubtedlypossessed iron prior to the Phrygian and Cimmerian migrations, suggest-ing such a caste was present from earlier times. This early caste is closelyassociated with the people known as Mushki, (the same people appearunder similar names in the various languages of the region; the Moesi ofThrace and their relatives in Asia Minor, the Mysians). The destructionof the Hittite kingdom, apparcntly, involved Phrygians from Thrace andthe more mysterious Mushki. The succeeding Phrygian kingdom of KingMidas, as it is known to Greek historians, involved the Mushki in Easternhistory. Allowing for some variation in the traditions, Midas in Easternhistory becomes King Mita, and his people were known to Sargon ofAssyria as the Mushki. The Mushki successfully opposed the Assyriansattempts to annexe the metal rich land of Tabal; with which the biblicalblacksmith Tubal-Cain is associated. After the Cimmerian invasion de-stroyed the Phrygian kingdom the north-easterly Mushki moved towardsColchis. The Moschi mountains berween Asia Minor and Colchis showtheir migration route in that direction, probably too a remaining presenceamong the hill tribes in those mountains. Another tribe, associated withthe Chalybes remaining in Asia Minor, is the Tibarenii who may be iden-tified with the people of former Tabal.In short, the metal working caste of both the Armeno-Chalybesof Colchis and the Chalybes of Asia Minor may have diverse origins.Nevertheless such castes also existed among the invaders, and all wouldnaturally have become associated with one another. Such communities,whether related ethnically or not, existed all round the Black Sea.It is notnecessary, and may not be possible, to firmly decide to what exrenr the"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Chalybes represented indigenous or migrant populations. The Chalybesundoubtedly formed alliances with succeeding waves of migrating Peo-ples. The kings of Lydia and Phrygia received such allegiance from themas their hereditary right. Such behaviour anthropology has shown is typi'cal of metallurgical castes. Outside the modern Western world, interac-tion between such castes and their neighbours are almost invariably basedupon treaties. Through such pacts they become tribute paying or sub-ject communities. Regardless of their ethnicity, what matters here is thatthe Chalybes coexisted, and even migrated alongside other communities,while retaining their own identity and roles.It was probably the coastal Chalybes who earned the fame of discoverersand untiring producers of iron on Mount Ida. The iron of highest qual-ity, transformed by carbon into steel, was named chalybos by the Greeks.This was also the name of a community of Chalybes in Pontus. The ironwas delivered as a tribute, or traded as a commodity, by the Chalybes totheir neighbours and the Greek towns. Stephanus of Byzantium, a writeron ancient geography of the 5'l'or 6'l'century AD, wrote of Chalybes inthe region of the river Thermodon. Although doubted at one tirne he wasvery likely correct. In the nineteenth century people were observed work-ing iron with charcoal at the site anciently called Oenoe in Pontus, whichis close ro rhe Therrnodon. This is in the neighbourhood of a historicalsettlement of Chalybes and the source aPPears to have been hematite ore,as in the Besh Parmak Mountains. The iron produced there in the nine-teenth century was sent to Constantinople, formerly Byzantium.In succeeding periods the hill-tribes would be growing smaller. In thecase of the specialised iron-stnelters, they were small in numbers to beginwith. Their market was restricted at 6rst, and when demand increasedthose seeking the iron would have sent their own people, in large num-bers. Such incursions would lead to the disapp earance of the hill-men,whether through extinction, assimilation or relocation. Another reasonfor the relatively small size of such communities is another principal dis-tinguishing feature of metallurgical castes; the practice of endogamy. Thispractice, of intermarriagewithin the clan, ensures their secrets remain theexclusive knowledge of the caste."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"It is essential to realise that these hill tribes served successive waves ofinvaders, and new dynasties among rhose aLready presenr. They were con-sidered as subject peoples and barbarians with their own rires, cusromsand beliefs. Nevertheless, the rites and pracrices of the hillmen inevitablyand powerfully infuenced those of the lowlanders. This infuence was noronly due to proximiry, as applies ro any relations between cultures. Theinfluence was intensified by the nature and role of the casre. Attitudestowards black smiths, and the casres to which they frequently belong, areusually ambivalent, and often suspicious. Their craft is seen, by themselvesand others, as involving magic. Not infrequenrly they have their own be-liefs, customs and rites, which distinguish them from their neighbours.Inaddition some of their practices in relation to their craft are often bothmagical and frightening. The use of blood to quench blades, or of dead orliving bodies to test them, is one source of such fear. Their social srarusand prestige c^n be highly vadable, ranging from outcasre ro one of socialsuperiority, depending on circumsrances.In this respect their position ap-proximates very closely to that of magical specialists, and religious casresin archaic societies. Nor infrequenrly the funcrions of magical and met-allurgical castes are united. There are many indications that this appliesvery strongly to the Chalybes.The aura of magic, fear and respecr for metallurgical castes very oftentransfers to their crearions. In particular this applies ro weapons. Theweapons are seen as possessed of special magic power; such weapons arewielded by heroes, and even gods. This, as shall be shown, was certainlytrue of beings such as the Telchines and Cyclops, who were essenriallysynonymous with the Dactyls."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Chalybes in lWtl, and ClassicalTraditionThe Dactyls in the Classical period were honoured as benevolent gods,and their names were recited as a protective incantation in times of fearand danger. They were also credited with composing the Ephesian let-ters, a famous protective incantation from the 4'h century scE. This wassaid to have been found inscribed upon a statue of the goddess. The in-cantation appears, with variants, on talismans and in the riruals of thepapyi; a standard form isr Aski Kataski Lix Tetrax Damnameneus Aision.These untranslatable words were known as Ephesia Grammata, and theterm was, and is, synonymous with the concept of barbarous names inincantations generally. The names of the male Dactyls are variously givenin different accounts: quoted fragments attributed to Hesiod give theirnames as Kelmis, Damnameneus, Delas and Skythes; Strabo calls themKelmis, Damnameneus, Heracles and Akmon; Pausanias calls themHeracles, Paionaios, Epimedes, Iasios (Iasion) and Idas or Acesidas.Akmon, Damnameneus and Kelmis are the eldest of them. The namesof the Telchines, another set of magician blacksmiths who guarded theinfant god Poseidon, show their relation to the Dactyls: collected fromvarious accounts, these names are Damon or Demonax who was theirchief,, atriad named Lykos, Skelmis and Damnameneus; a quartet namedAktaios, Megalesios, Ormenus or Hormenus and Lykos.Among the accomplishments of the Telchines were the making of thetrident of Poseidon and the sickle of Cronus. The sickle of Cronus wasoriginally that of an earth goddess. Sickles were dedicated to ArtemisOrthia in Sparta as well as to Demeter, and a similar weapon was usedby the Chalybes to butcher and decapitate their enemies. The trident ofPoseidon was origin ally a form of thunderbolt, both sickle and tridentweapons were wielded by Middle Eastern thunder deities.Eustathius, following Stesichorus, identilies the Curetes and Telchines,calling them magicians of Cretan origin. He describes them as of twosorts, reflecting the beneficent and malefic roles originally inherent in allspirits and the magicians later identified with them. One sort were crafts-men who invented statuary and discovered metals, the others were fear-"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"some, bringers of 6erce winds, possessed of cups in which rhey breweddestructive potions from roors. They had varied forms, generally amphibi-ous and demonic: some were like men, some fishes or serpents, some hadno hands, others lacked feet, and they had webbed fingers, blue eyes andblack tails. The evil nature of the Telchines emphasised by some authorsrefects their place in the old order, their earlier dual nature only becomespurely evil with the coming of the Olympian religion. Their srrange formsare reminiscent of the so called Minoan daimons or genii; these are rep-resented as performing ritual acts, clearly suggesting a priestly role. Theirform however is anything but human, having dog-like snours and pawsand a strange tapering cover on their backs which Burkert compares tothe Egyptian images of Taurt, who wears a crocodile on her back. Thisresemblance, while significant, does nor account for their number or theritualistic roles in which they are portrayed.According to some the female Dactyls were identical with the mountainnymphs called the Oreades, who were associated with pine trees growingon the mountains. By mating with the male Dactyls they were the moth-ers of the Curetes and Corybantes. In the rires of Cybele and Dionysusthese were the male equivalents of the Manads; and thus the Dactylswere also said to be the parenrs of the Cabirs, Satyrs and so on. Anothergroup of five rustic nymphs associated with the female Dactyls were theHecaterides, whose name is strongly reminiscent of Hecate. Some indeedmake the Oreades daughters of Hecate.The names of the Curetes are occasionally given as Prymneus, Mimas,Akmon, Damneus (Dam.tr-eneusi), Ocythous and Idaeus, which listshows convergences with the Dactyls and Telchines. The Cureres werepaired with Ash nymphs known as Meliai, which likely connecrs with thename Melissa, a name meaning Priestess and connected with honey, ACurete of Sparta named Pyrrhikhos is associated with Silenus, and an-other named Melisseus with Aristaus. Indeed Melisseus, or 6oney manis variously counted among the Titans and Curetes, and is rhe name of aCorybante of Euboia.The Cabiri - like the Dactyls - are a group of mystical figures associ-ated with important Mystery religions of the ancient world. They were"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"said for exampte to havehtrended';;-,;or;\".,:ar pergamus, anorh-er place name common to Crete and Anatolia. The meaning and originof the term Cabiri has baffied scholars, but it may be derived from theSemitic root le b r , perhaps via the Assyrian kuburu meaning great; thusthe Kabirim or Great Gods. This is in turn seems ro connect them withthe Cherubim or strong ones. Like the Dactyls rhey were considered to beworkers in metal, associated with fire, and to be sons of Hephastus. Hisname among the Romans was Vulcan, etymologically and mythically con-nected with volcanic 6re. In the rites of Eleusis, and by analogy elsewhere,the names of the gods were given coded cover names, and such the titlesof the Cabirs seem to be. Not infrequently they, or the gods whose attend-ants or representatives they were, are refened to anonymously as TheoiMegaloi, the Great Gods, the Greek equivalent of Kabirim. K easily be-comes softened to a G in the languages of the region, and the Kabirimbecome the Geburim or Strong Ones. Gebers is also an Arabic name forthe Magian sect, suggesting Cabirs in the tave' with the infant Jesus. TheHebrew word CbBR means to conjoin, a joining of words, incanrarions, abrother, and sorcerer.Another such group is the Corybantes; the rerm represenrs mythicalIigures that guarded the infant Zeus on Mount Ida, but also priests of theMystery cult in Phrygia and Crete. In the celebration of their rites theyclashed shields and weapons, beat cymbals and behaved as if delirious.They are often identified with the Idaean Dactyls. There was a festivalat Cnossus in Crete called Corybantica. The Corybantes are also com-pared with or similar to another group, the Curetes. Like the Dactyls, rheCuretes' knowledge of all the arts was extensive and they communicatedit to many parts of ancient Greece. They were the guardians of the infantZeus, whom his father Cronus wished to destroy; they prevented his criesbeing heard by the clashing of their shields and of cymbals in a warlikedance. As a reward for this they were made the special priests of the GreatGoddess. They, and the Corybantes with whom they are often identified,were also known as the defenders of Zagreus, Zeus' son by Persephonegoddess of the Underworld. Older and younger forms of gods and god-desses in these rites often have differenr names. In some cases these ap-"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"pear as if quite distinct from their other selves. Zagreus originally was aname given to the infant Zeus himself,Although archaeology shows that the Idaean cavelater associated withthe Zeus cult was less impressive in Minoan times, it also demonstratesthat it subsequently became a major cult centre where initiations wereperformed . Bronze Curete shields have been found together with ampleevidence of aZeus cult fitting Classical descriptions. The cave sancruariesare undoubtedly more ancienr, dating to Minoan times, and the associa-tion with the Dacryls may well precede the cult of Zeus in the Classicalperiod. Among the Minoan offerings known from these caves are somebronze swords and other artefacts which are manifestly unfinished.Unfinished work does not become the possession of any ordinary person,still less a noble, strongly suggesting that these are ofFerings by an ancienrguild of smiths.Strabo likens the Curetes and Corybantes to the Satyrs who accompa-nied Dionysus or Bacchus. Among these is found Silenus, who guardedthe infant god, and became his attendant and philosophical counsellor inmaturity. Also among the Satyrs was rhe flute playing Marsyas, and thepoet Olympas. The Satyrs and other attendants such as the Telchines alsoaccompanied Dionysus on his conquest of the East including a legendaryexpedition to India.Various accounts of the number and the names of the Cabiri are givenin ancient writings, representing different phases of developmenr and dif,ferentiation. Where the number is three generally a primordial one is at,tended by a pair. Seven are also found, resembling the Pelasgian Titansand the Babylonian planetary gods.Representative of these versions in rhe Greek world are a pair namedAlcon and Eurymedon and a group of four named Axierus, Axiocersa,Axiocersus and Kadmillos. These four are equated in some accounrswith Demeter, Persephone, Hades and Hermes. The latter has been con-sidered a \\ater addition to the central triad. However, while Hermes isClassical Greek and the Cabirs older, the identification of this 6gure withthe candidate for initiation means Kadmillos is likely to be rhe primordialdeity, Such a figure establishes the cult by being at once its deity and the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"6rst initiate. Another name associated with them is Dardanos, who waseither one of the Cabiri, or responsible for introducing their rites to theTrojans. He also had a brother named Iasion, which is the name of one ofthe Dactyls.In Hellenistic times Dardanos appears in the Magical Papyri,in association with the magical use of a lodestone.The Mysteries with which the Cabirs are connected were particularlyimportant at Imbrus and Samothrace; those at Samoth race were cel-ebrated in particular splendour. Divine honours were also paid to them inPhrygia and in Macedonia, at Lemnos, Thebes, Anthedon, Pergamus andelsewhere. None but the priesthood were permitted to enter their templebut their patronage and protection was sought through initiation by allthe ancient heroes and princes. Philip of Macedon and Queen Olympiaswere initiated, and Germanicus Caesar was only prevented by an omen,which did not long precede his death. Among the gifts they could bestowwas safety at sea, by the conferring of a purple bracelet, which was prob-ably made of wooi from a sacrificial ram.Certain affinities between the Cabirs and Dioscuri had always existed.In the late Classical period the Cabirs came to be mainly regarded as pa-trons of navigation, as were the Dioscuri. This role had always belongedto the Cabirs anyway. Herodotus described images of the Cabiri as re-sembling dwarfs; dwarf-like figures called Pataikoi also formed the frg-ureheads of Phoenician ships. The father of the Cabirs was said to beHephastus, an ancient god with dominion over the working of metals.According to Sanchuniathon he was also the first who ever sailed a ship.While this god was often a 6gure of mockery in bfficial' Olympian myth,he bears many signs of far greatd original dignity. His image was commonin ordinary Athenian households, and he was worshipped as a great godat Lemnos and elsewhere. He had anciently been partnered with Athenarather than Aphrodite. Images of this pair were common in Athenianhomes, as household gods. Athena as eternal virgin was a relatively latedevelopment, and it appears both she and Hephastus were drasticallyoverhauled in the interests of the Oiympian state-religion.The Dioscuri were divine twins represented by the constellationGemini. The astrological symbol of this sign is a representation of a mys-"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"terious cult objecr associared with rhem, known as rhe dokana. To theGreeks they were known as Casror and Polydeuces, and to the Romans asCastor and Pollux. In Classical legend they were sons of Zeus, either byNemesis or Leda. Zeus seduced l,eda in the form of a swan and she pro-duced two eggs, from which two sets of twins were hatched, rwo morral,two divine. In some accounrs the immortal offsprin g of Zeus were Polluxand Helen, the morral offspring of Ledas husband Tyndarus were Castorand Clytemnesrra. According to others she produced only one egg, fromwhich the Dioscuri were born. Their relarionship with Helen however isan important feature of many myths; her divine nattrre,while variously ex-plained, reflects a pre-olympian cult.In some accounts she is united withthe hero Achilles in the Elysian Fields, while other myths show Medea inthis role. Both seem to derive from archaic representations of the goddessas daughter, as suggested by Helen's role in the srory of Autoleon, andMedeat relationship with Hecate.Some authors point ro apparent confusion between the Dioscuri andthe Cabirs in later times. However, like the Cabirs the archaic characrerof the Dioscuri was nor well understood in the Classical period, and theconnection is signifrcanr in several respects. Speaking generally, while theDioscuri resemble parricular roles among the Cabirs, not all roles amongthe Cabirs resemble the Dioscuri. The Dioscuri were also credited withthe invention of war-dances, which links them with the Curetes andCorybantes. They are often represented on horseback, wearing helmetsdescribed as egg-like in shape (when nor wearing the Phrygian cap ha-bitually worn by Mithras), and with stars over their heads. These featuresand others are all represented on steles and engraved gems from ancienttimes, associated with Mystery cults in Thrace and elsewhere. A revealingaspect of their myth makes them initiates of rhe rites of the Cabiri, andthe Mysteries of Eleusis. Their involvement with both from an early date,whatever their original role, is a powerful likelihood.The Dioscuri in Classical myth are represenred as taking parr in thevoyage of the Argo as soon as they reached maturity. Afterwards they per-sonally cleared the Hellespont and surrounding seas of pirates.

When only one lire was seen it fore-told storms, while two indicatedfair weather, and the aid of the Dioscuriwas then sought by the seafarers. The same omen applied in the case ofsighdngs of the stars of Gemini represenring rhern.The connection with the sea also links the Dioscuri with the Telchines,who were seen as sea gods and magicians. It is significant that theTelchines had a distincrly sinister repurarion for magic and the evil eye.Indeed among the variously titled guards of the divine infant are rheprime suspects for the slaying and eating of the god.

Motifs and im-ages on medieval Croatian tombstones also portray the same consistenrdetails. There is no doubt that these rites represenr a powerful and livingelement of the culture of the region, stretching back thousands of years.In modern times the rites themselves have been observed by anthropolo,"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"gists. The rituals concerned are stages of a Larger schema. The descriptionwhich follows concerns several inter-related parts, which do not consri-tute the whole cycle of folk ritual in the region. Rather is it the core ofritual acdvity, to which other parrs relate, and from which some lesserrites may be extracted in adapted form ro serve different needs.This greater rite is in many respects a festival of the dead, although otherfunctions are connected with it. It occurs over three days in May orJune.On the 6rst day the graves of the dead are visited, food and drink given tothem, and an invitation to return made aloud, Later there is a procession,first come female relatives of the dead bearing food and drink. Behindthem comes a row of dancers consisting of three young women, with ayoung man at each end. One of these young men musr, and both may beara sword; all hold hands, in which are held sprigs of vegetation, wine, eggsand perhaps lighted candles. Behind these come musicians, who are nowa-days often violinists, but originally would have included flute players andbeaters of drums and cymbals. The purpose of this procession appears robe to bring the dead to the place where the ritual is celebrated. A draggingmotion forms a part of the dance, and small mirrors are worn on the backsof the dancers as if to catch the spirits.On reaching their destination, which in this context is the rown square,a feast is laid out. The musicians are seated and sing a song in praise ofthe dead. The dancers perform another dance, forming the same row withlinked hands. During the dance the female relatives of the dead feed themfrom the table. There are several such groups of dancers working inde-pendently on behalf of various families gathered in the square at this time.The dance is repeated for each dead person, and even for aged personswho lie under the table of feasting as if in mimicry of death, who explainthat they are ensuring in advance that their funerary rires are properlyperformed.Another kind of dance follows this part of the festival, and does notinvolve the same dancers. This is alarge circle dance in which any of thevillagers may take part, and in which married women, and particularlybrides of the past year are obliged to participate. These clearly are not theequivalents of the ancient ritualists represented by the dancers and musi-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"cians from the previous stage \"r.n\" ,r* il\" \"r rn\" rite appears tobe to guarantee fenrlity, and very likely ro promore the rebirth of the deadinto the community.Another stage of the rite, which was beginning to be neglected whenthese observations took place, was once an integral part of these celebra-tions. Certain women, known as'falling ones' come to the square andcollapse in trance, They are fully aware that this is going to happen, andattend the rite perhaps entirely for that purpose. They need not have par-ticipated in any of the dances; the trance is the important aspecr of theirpart in the proceedings. The manner of their restoration to consciousnessis evidently an ancient aspect of rhe ceremony. A group from among theritual dancers and musicians carry the entranced woman towards the river.As they near the bank they put her down, and the principal sword dancerdraws a cross upon her chest with his sword. He then chews garlic andwormwood and spits it upon her cheek. The whole rroop then touchesher with their feet and dance three times around her, singing a magical in-cantation. They then lift her up and carry her on, purring her down againand performing the whole procedure three times by the dme the bank isreached. At one time the entranced woman was also carcied to the otherside of the river and it is safe to assume this was a feature of the ancientrite of which the whole is a survival. She is then raised to her feet and thesword bearers cross their swords over her head, and water is poured overthe crossed blades. One of the men catches the water in his hand and of-fers it to her to drink. At this point she usually recovers immediately, butif not the procedure is repeated several times. If she still does not awakenfrom trance honey is put in her mouth and she is left ro recover in herown time. If this rite was not performed on her behalf it is believed shewould go mad or die. The purpose of her trance is not to prophesy, whichhowever she may perform at other times. She is making a journey to theunderworld on behalf of the deceased, and is then brought back to life bymagical rites, to prevent her soul being lost in the Underworld.The swordsmen clearly represent figures such as the war-dancers of theMystery rites. The voyage across the water is significant given that theDioscuri, Cabirs and Telchines are associated with protection from perils"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"at sea. The goal of spirit rescue is also presenr in the legendary voyage ofthe Argonauts, in which figures such as Orpheus and the Dioscuri takepart. The musicians, with their song for the dead, clearly represenr la-menting magicians. The falling women possess the ability to did and visitthe underworld on another's behalf, being then magically restored to life.These themes are clearly archaic and connect with ancestral funerary rites.It is as well to clarify a few points regarding archaic Greek religion be-forc analysing these rites any further. Naturally most people are awarethat Mediterranean and Middle Eastern paganism was by nature tolerantof other peopleb gods and religious practices. Hostility towards other reli-gions was rare; the usual response was generally curiosity and the makingof comparisons. What is less understood is that the Classical mythologi-cal literature of the Greeks has virtually nothing to do with their religiouspractice. On a regional level beliefs and practices were not concerned withthe huge collection of deities of the sky, earth, sea and underworld, andtheir innumerable lovers, ofFspring, enemies and favourites, or even neces'sarily with the twelve Olympians. Before the rise of literacy and the ur-banised state, and long after in rural areas, the various local tribal religionseach involved a more self contained cast and mythic drama. Involving,for example: a fertile goddess, a male husband, consort or son represenr-ing the Sun, the Spring or the Year, with perhaps a semi-deihed royal orpriestly figure in addition. Frequently one or more of these central charac-ters manifested in a vadety of modes. Often a god, goddess or hero mani-fested in younger and older modes, or in other dual roles such as solar andchthonic.These deities were attended by such rites as described above. In addi-tion by initiation rituals, the recital or singing of sacred poerry, and a moreancient music; which are the more perishable parts of anrique religionsin the folk memory. The substitution of a violin has in any case Classicalprecedents that are in themselves instructive. It is well known that thecontroversial Athenian leader, Alcibiades, was accused of disrespecringthe Mysteries and defacing the sacred herms (which were related ro thephallic images at Samothrace).It is less well known that he made the play,ing of flutes unpopular in Athens, saying they distorted the features of the46"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"ptayermaking them ridicutous, \"\"4 ;:;;agingly to their useby the'backward'people of Boeotia. It is simple enough to deduce frornthis that the religious use of the lyre was an innovation. It is more thancoincidental that, at the end of rhe Peloponnesian war, rhe'traditionalist'Spartans tore down the walls of Arhens accompanied by the playing of{1utes.The mythological literature is, in many respecrs, the response of a laterstage of culture grown distant from its roots. It represents arrempts rorationalise or interpret allegorically the primitive elements of hundreds oflocal cults and their varianrs that had arisen in previous cenruries. Manyof these traditions had their roors in the Minoan and Mycenaean periodsfrom 3ooo to rzoo ncE, whereas Homer and the Classical interpretationsof older myth date from 8oo ncE, beginning the Classical period that con-tinued to 4oo ecn. Once this is understood it is easier to appreciate theimportance of local folk ritual, when supported by srrong archaeologicalevidence as well as literary references. While features such as god-names,music and spoken liturgy perish, much else is perperuared faithfully andrevealingly. That the surviving details of these rituals correspond in largepart with the celebration of the Mysteries is reasonably certain. However,there are other aspecrs of the goeres activities thar remain to be shown.Firstly, a paramount considerarion is the relation of these magiciansto works of fire. Comparatively little evidence of mining can be found inmany regions where the Mysteries were celebrated. The importance ofritual 6re is another matter. In addition there are rires of purification andof healing. These too can be traced in the folk rituals of the region, withstartling correspondence in detail, casring considerable light on the ob-scurity of the Literary sources. The Dioscuri, according to many sources,became associated with the Cabirs through some resemblance ro them.However, figures such as the Dioscuri seem always to have been part ofthe ritual cycle. Disregarding syncretic combinations from difibrent erhnicorigins, the main distinction is a matter of role within the celebrations. Itis evident that the males among the Cabirs or Dactyls musr include fire-makers, who judging from these survivals are equared with the Dioscuri.zt/"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAThe ritual cycle in the region, even in its recent srare, is complex. Parts ofthe cycle,which initially musr have formed a unified whole, appear to havebecome detached, reflecdng the various purposes served by its parts. Themaking of ritual fire is among these detached elements, and prope r\\y be-longs to the first part of the cycle. It is a Mystery, and only those involvedin the process are allowed to be presenr when it is performed, even thoughit is understood to be taking place. Prior to the making of this new fire, allthe village 6res are extinguished, being considered to have become unfor-tunate in some way,A branch with a fork of two equal tines is selected from a tree; eitherfir, lime or willow. The locals refer to the rwo prongs as rwins, like theDioscuri themselves. These are cut from the branch and dried before be-ing made into two posts. These are planted in the ground and circularholes cut into them near the top. A wooden bar, often of softer wood, isinserted into these so that it may rorate in them. A second bar, or a rope,is occasionally placed lower down to act as a brace. A cord is then loopedaround the uppermost bar, and held by rwo men, prefenbly rwins. Somecustomary means exist to provide for the non-availability of twins, includ-ing atwin making ceremony'.When these twins pull their ends of the cord, in swift alrernare mo-tion, friction is produced in the holes at rhe top of the twin poles.

A third person catches these in dry tinderand carries it offlike Prometheus stealing fire from Heaven. Having madefire other stages of the ritual cycle become possible, and it appears fromthis that originally the fire making rire was the first srage of the cycle. Thetraditional purifying and healing powers of the Dactyls or Cabirs followfrom the making of ritual fire.This purification rite, like the revival of the falling women, is often per,formed beside a river. It requires a tunnel ro be dug under the roots of anoak-tree, the tree associated with Zeus.

This is demonstrated by the Venus tablet of KingAmisaduqa. It is likely enough that this was preceded by a long periodof development, perhaps two hundred years. Great strides were madein Mesopotamian astronomy from around 7oo ecn, related to the lunarcalendar and the prediction of eclipses. By the Late 4't'century BCE rheChaldeans were capable of producing accurate predictive tables of lunarpositions.The history of astrology, then, consists of two strands. The oldest ofthese is the taking of omens from the observation of the heavens. Thisexisted among many peoples, without a comprehensive method of fore-casting, from the earliest times. Its existence undoubtedly contributed tothe later development of astronomy and astrology. The second srrand,which produced the main elements of the sysrem known as asrrology inthe West, was both predictive and comprehensive.

Amongthem are dreadful manifestations of vengeful underworld deities, magi-cal countermeasures, details of the day to day life of a soothsayer, sev-eral sacrificial rites, and a god of the Mystery cults more ancienr than theOlympians.This point in the epic contains so much that a focussed commentary isessential.

In anycase the Thracian connections of Phineus are well enough representedby our text.Phineus himself is a figure with whom many variant myths are associ-ated. Most details concerning him do not require thorough commentary,only that he was a son of Agenor, and thus related to Europa, Minos andRhadamanthus, as well as Tityos.

These were the two sons of the North Wind, Zetes andCalais. They were brothers in law to Phineus, and possessed of the powerof fight. Their father, Boreas, the North Wind himself, was nor only agod but a Thracian king. The name Hyperborea, which pertained to amysterious region associated with Apollo, means behind the North Wind,and is derived from the name Boreas. The interlocking relationships ofthis family are indicative of an alternative pantheon, separate from theOlympian cultus, and older.Tbe ErinyesAs the Erinyes are among the most important figures of the Greek un-derworld they deserve a digression here. These avenging deities dwelt inTartarus, the deepest region of dark Hades. Their purpose was to punishwrongdoers, in this world and the next. In particular they avenged diso-bedience to parents, disrespect towards the aged, perjury, murder, crimesagainst the sacred customs of hospitality, and mistreatment of suppliants.The name Erinyes is the most ancienq they carne to be known also asthe Eumenides, meaning the well-meaning or soothed goddesses, a title ap'parently used by way of euphemism, as people feared to mention themby name. On the other hand this title is not entirely undeserved; whilehorrific to wrongdoers, so far as those wronged were concerned their na-ture was benign.In consequence they possessed numerous shrines, one ofwhich plays a major role in Sophocles'play Oedipus at Colonus.In form they appeared as fearsome maidens with wings like a bat's, hav-ing either serpents entwined in their hair or serpents rather than hair,their eyes dripping with blood, and dressed in black, blood stained gar-ments. In one hand they held a burning torch, and in the other a whip ofscorpions. Terror, pallor, rage and death attended them at all times.

Accordingto Hesiod they sprang from the blood spilt by Kronos when he castrat-ed Ouranos with his frightful sickle. It is noteworthy thar rhe birth ofAphrodite sprang from this same event. Sophocles tells us their parentswere Nox, goddess of night, and the god of the infernal. dver, Acheron.According to others they were daughrers of Hades and Persephone,of whose court they certainly formed a prominenr part. All agree theywere amongst the mosr ancient divinities, older far than Zeus and theOlympians. They received divine honours throughout the Greek world inaccord with this status. Their sacrifices consisted of doves and black sheep;and those attending them bore branches of cedar, alder, hawthorn and ju-niper, as well as saffron. According to some libations to the Eumenidesconsisted of honey and wine. However according to Sophocles, who wasborn at Colonus near one of their sancruaries, the libations were threein number the last of which at least was wineless, consisting of the oldchthonic offering of mixed water and honey. Other references are specificthat their libations were of nephalia, the Greek term for the offering ofmixed honey and water. Circe makes this offering whenJason and Medeavisit her as suppliants.The antiquity of the Erinyes is demonstrated by a singular form, Erinys.This is the name of a goddess found in the Linear B inscriptions fromMycenean Crete.The name also survives in rhe guise of Demeter Erinys.This archaic form of Demeter is horse headed, suggestive of nightmare;her paramour is Poseidon, himself the patron of rhe necromantic oracleof Tainaron.

They were knownto the Romans as the Furies. These then were the horrific underworiddeities that afflicted Phineus. The sons of Boreas took pity on Phineus,and - having assured themselves that no divine displeasure would befallthem for assisting him - they awaited the next appearance of the Furies,and pursued thern. They came very close to catching them, even touchingthem at one point, and would certainly have slain them had they done so.This was prevented by Iris, the female messenger of the gods (who un-like Hermes seems to have had no underworld role), who descended fromOlympus to intervene. Taking the mighty oath of the gods upon the wa-ters of the infernal river Styx, she assured them that from now on Phineuswould be liberated from his terrible plight. The epic tells us that at thispoint the Furies withdrew to the cavern on Mount Dicte, one of the mostimportant mystery centres of Crete. It is interesting and important thatdeities of the Greek underworld are here associated with the mysteries ofthe cave of initiation. Importanr too that while Cretan religion differed inmany respects from Mycenaean, the underworld Judges of later Classicalmythology had been kings of the island.To resume: Iris returned to Olympus, and Calais andZetes returned toBithynia; the Furies they had pursued returned to Crete. While the sonsof Boreas were gone the Argonauts busied themselves removing the tracesof the foul visitants. They made a sacrifice of sheep, prepared a feast, andtalked through the night as they waited with their host. He prophesiedand forewarned them of the dangers they would face on their journey.A little before dawn the sons of Boreas returned, and gave a full accountof their pursuit of the Furies, the intervention of lris, and her promiseon behalf of Phineus. The pursuit, by Thracian heroes, of the Furies af-ficting Phineus, resembles similar fights of shamans and magicians ofmany cultures. Such fights, or journeys into the spirit world, are oftenundertaken on behalf of a member of the tribe, or other client. The pur-pose of such journeys is, often, to fight with spirits who have brought ill-ness, misfortune, even death to the person on whose behalf the magicianis working; and thus end the affiiction."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAwhen the sons of Boreas recounr their adventures they arc, naturallyenough, at the home of Phineus, who is a prophet or soothsayer.

What is certain isthat the accounr of the journey tells us much about the integration ofthese traditions with those of the Greeks, whether or nor the Greeks hadpreviously possessed similar traditions.After the nightjourney which relieves him, Phineus stoically accepts hisblindness, and prays for an imminent death, making the interesting obser-vation that this will bring him perfect bliss. This is reminiscent of the tra-ditions surrounding the Thracian Zalmoxis, whose initiates anticipateda pleasing furure life.

There are many ofthese visitors and they bring with them food offerings, in return for whichPlrineus foretells their futures, in matters great and small.It is made clearthat these visitors are not distinguished by social class, but includes richand poor, and Phineus treats them equally. He accords them the samecourtesy on this day, even though he has cause for celebration, as well ashonoured guests in the form of his saviours.

His fatherhad offended a ree spirit - known as a Hamadryad - by cutting down aparticular tree, and from this event Paraebius suffered an inherited curse.He had been freed by Phineus who instructed him how to appease theHamadryad by building an akar and making appropriate offerings andprayers for release.Phineus next instructed the Argonauts how to continue on their jour-ney, and deal with the hazards they had yet to face.

The character of Aristaus constitutes an extraordinarily well de-veloped figure, although the various references to him have to be collatedto understand his importance and relevance to this study. This I have at-tempted to do below.AristeusClassical scholars and other academics have tentatively identified some ar-chaic hero figures of the pre-olympian traditions as gods of older cults.Inthe case of Aristaus the identification is not tentative but certain. Whilehe survives in Classical myth as a king, hero and benefactor of hurnanity,his earlier status as a deity of considerable imporrance is strongly estab-lished. This is not to say rhar no obscurity surrounds him, as it does evenvarious Olympian deities; nevertheless his powers, pedigree, culr cenrresand other details are sufficient to identify him as a god.By collating the references and information relevant to Aristaus a de-tailed and significant picture emerges. He is revealed as an important256"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"pre-Olympian deity, with a substantial role in the Mystery traditions; theMysteries of Dionysus in particular. His origins are apparently in Thessaly,a'barbarous' region north of Greece. In Classical tradition Aristaus wasusually called a son of Apollo and the nymph Cyrene, a powerful huntinggoddess. His broth er by the same parents was the prophet Idmon, one ofthe Argonauts.In fact Aristaus is older than the Classical Apollo, and waslikely both son and lover of this Cyrene. Bacchylides gives his parents asOuranos and Gaia, Heaven and Earth, which may reflect older traditions.On the subject of alternative parentage, the Scholiast on the Argonauticacites Pherecydes as calling Aristaus the father of Hecate. Besides her rel-evance to our study as a patron of magic, Hecate also played a major rolein the Mysteries of Eleusis, doubly underlining the importance of thisidentification.The Baotian form of Aristaus was referred to in later times as the pas-toral Apollo. This likely refects the way many older gods were either ab-sorbed by the Olympians or demoted in status.In Classical sources again,Aristaus was born in Libya, and Hermes himself acted as midwife. Thisreflecrs his status at Cyrene; a colony in Libya founded by settlers fromthe island of Thera. In this version the city took its name from this event.The colony possessed a temple to Cyrene and Aristaus as their principaldeities. A colossal head frorn a statue of Aristaus is in the collection atthe Detroit Institute of Arts. This head, which is 5z centimetres tall, isthought to come from the ternple at Cyrene.Its serene expression is remi-niscent of images of Apollo. Pindar, who is a major Classical source onAristaeus, has him taken by Hermes to the earth goddess Gaia. S[re feedsthe child on the nectar and ambrosia that are the food and drink of thegods, and makes him immortal. The prophecy of Chiron, foretelling thebirth of Aristaus to Cyrene, says that Gaia feeding him in this way willordain him an immortal being: a Zeus or Holy Apollo.Tlre reality is that Aristaus predates his association with Zeus, Apolloand Hermes, and exemplifies their superimposed relation to the older tra-ditions. His name is in fact a title, from the same root as aristocrat andmeans best. Similar terms are used to describe the greatest and bravestheroes, and the pizes bestowed on them. He bore the additional titles of"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIANomius (shepherd) and Agreu s (bunter).All three titles are mentioned byPindar as being applied to Apollo or Zeus. However, Agreus is a title notonly of Aristaeus but of Pan, while Nomius was also applied to Pan, withHermes and Apollo. other titles of Zeus are frequently associated wirhAristaus. Another of his titles is Alexeter, meaning helpea guardian orchampion; Literally one who keeps ofi a powerful defender from calamityor enemies.He was given into the care of the Earth goddess Gaia and the goddessesof the hours or seasons (Hora); or as others say of nymphs who werechildren of Hermes. From these he received instruction in dairy farming,vine-keeping and bee-keeping. Others say he learned rhese arts from theMuses at alater date. In his myth the daughters of Hermes, the goddessesof the Hours and the Muses are likely identical; they probably representpriestesses of an archaic cult, in which Aristaeus and Cyrene were god andgoddess. This possibility is reinforced by the roles of certain women inthe myth and rites of Dionysus, as will be shown. His delivery into Gaiascharge indicates his origins as a Titan. The Titans were the offspring ofGaia and Ouranos. Pherecydes, the star-gaztng menror of Pyrhagoraswho was introduced earlier, identified Aristaus of Ceos with Astraios;the Titan who was father of the winds and srars, and the husband of thegoddess of the dawn.Aristaus next spenr some time in Boeotia, until Apollo put him in thecare of the centaur Chiron (others add the nymph Melissa) for further,perhaps more esoteric instruction. He afterwards wenr to Thebes, wherehe was instructed in prophecy and healing by the Muses (of course, rhesewere things in which Chiron could readily have instructed him). His edu-cation by Chiron, who some accounrs consider to be his father,taken withhis Theban connections, are reminiscent of the prophet Tiresias. Whileunder the tuition of the Muses he also acted as shepherd for their flocks.While protecting the Muses'herds Aristaus perfected his undersrand-ing of hunting. These skills included hunting with pits and ners, amongother methods; his morher was a mighty huntress and he inherited theseskills from her. It is noreworthy that both Aristaus and Hermes are rcp-resented bearing a sheep on their shoulders. Further, there is consider-258"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"able overlap in Classical myth between Apollo and Hermes, relating toprophecy, guarding flocks and other matters. Aristaus unites the sharedattributes of the two gods in himself, just as he has attributes claimed byOlympian Zeus. The clear implication is that he preceded them in localcults typifying the chthonic traditions that preceded the more homog-enous Olympian religion.In Classical myth too he travelled widely throughout the world, this is astandard mythological device accounting for his widespread worship. Hesettled in Greece where he married Autone. His bride was the daughterof Cadmus, son of Agenor and brother of Europa, a famrLy which recurstime and again in this study. The children of Aristaus and Autone in-cluded a daughter named Macris, the nurse of Dionysus, and a son, thehunter Actzon. This son - whose myth while comparatively minor isconsiderably better known - sufFered a cruel punishment for seeing thegoddess Artemis bathing in a spring. He was transformed into a stag andkilled by his own hunting dogs.It is not to be overlooked that the motherof Aristaeus was herself a hunting goddess like Artemis.Desolated at his loss, Aristeus returned to travelling, visiting Sardinia,Sicily (h\" it particularly associated with Mount Etna), and Greek Italy.Everywhere he went he dispensed knowl,edge, that of bee-keeping, andthe cultivation of the vine and olive, the source of wine and oil. In returnfor these blessings he was worshipped in all of these places. At the islandof Cos or Ceos, which was seffled by his descendents, he ended a droughtand plague by building a temple to Zeus Icmaeus, giver of moisture. Hewas worshipped by the islanders, sometimes under the name of ZeusAristaus. From here he travelled on to Thrace where the best known partof his myth took place.In the old chronology of Greek myth, the above history of Aristuus hasakeady occurred before thevoyage of the Argonauts. The events describedbelow occur later, and also concern the subsequent history of Orpheus."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Aristrcus in later trttditionIt is a curious fact that Aristaus receives considerable attention from au-thors in the Hellenistic period.The most important among these is Virgil,who mentions his role in the death of Eurydice. Apollonius of Rhodesgives him substantial mention, and some of his other allusions connectwith the god. Still later authors, such as Oppian and Nonnus, also makesubstantial additions to our knowledge of Aristrus. Ir is importanr ronote that Virgil's reference to him connecrs Aristreus with the legendof Orpheus, while Oppian and Nonnus connecr him directly with theMysteries of Dionysus. That Apollonius does not mention his connectionwith these traditions is not surprising, he had a parricularly strong senseof the logical ordering of mythic history, and evenrs in his Argonauticaprecede the love of Orpheus for Eurydice. Many artemprs have been madeto portray Orpheus as a real or mythical reformer of the Dionysian rites,whose orgiastic nature he gready reduced. Others have shown that thedeath of Orpheus itself resembles the death of Dionysus, suggesting thattheir rites as well as their cults were rivals or alternative forms. In anycase the involvement of Aristaus in this body of lore is considerable andworthy of close examination,In the past, when conventional Classical studies were widespread, it wascommonplace to portray Mrgil as the rival in Latin of Homer. In rhe r8'l'century Lempridre described Virgil as basing his poetry on histori c fact,and providing entirely credible origins for Roman religious traditions.There is no doubt that his tracing of 'Trojan traditions in Roman reli-gion involves far more than invention, whether the traditions involved areEtruscan, Phoenician or brought by Greeks from Asia Minor.Although a late part of the tradition concerning him, Aristaus' placein the myth of Orpheus as recorded in rhe writings of Vrgil is the best-known reference to him. According ro this version Aristaus, while inThrace fell in love with Eurydice, the bride of Orpheus, who he pursuedwhen she fled from him. She was bitten by a snake while fl,eeing,and died inconsequence. Orpheus then sought to reclaim her from the Underworld.Aristaus meanwhile was punished by the nymphs for his crime by the"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"destruction of his bees with a devastating sickness. Anguished by rhis loss,Aristaus sought the advice of his mother, Cyrene. The manner in whichhe contacted her is significant.In Classical myrh Cyrenewas rhe daughterof the river god Peneus, Aristaus took hirnself to this river and invokedCyrene with a lamentation. That is to say, his call to her is delivered in awailing tone, like a goen. She told him to seize the reluctant prophet-godof the sea, Proreus, and demand a solution from him. This he did, notmerely holding Proreus but binding him, and was advised that his plightwas in punishment for causing the death of Eurydice. The involvement ofProteus in this stage of the myth may be an interpolation or local variant;perhaps replacing Cyrene as oracular goddess.From Cyrene he learned that he was to raise fou,r altars to the Dryads,tree nymphs who were companions of Eurydice. (Such demi-goddesseswere traditionally offered rnilk, oil and honey, all moist substances whichAristaus was concerned with. On occasion they also received the sacri-fice of a goat). On these four altars Aristaus was to sacrifice four heifersand four bulls. He was then to leave the bodies where they Iay for ninedays, and then return with offerings of poppies for forgetfulness, a fattedcalf and a black ewe. The ewe was to propitiate Orpheus, who had joinedEurydice in the underworld. Aristaus followed these instructions, and onreturning on the ninth day found that swarms of bees had appeared fromthe rotten carcasses.Oppian, a Greek poet of the 3'd century cp named Aristaus as the fosterfather of Dionysus. The holy choir of the Mystery rite he named as thedaughters of Cadmos: fno, Aguae and Autonoe. These women had takenthe sacred coffer containing the infant Dionysus, wreathed it and placed inupon the back of an ass. They came to the shores of the Euripos (a straitdividing Boetia from the island of Macris, better known as Euboea) wherethey met with an old seafarer and his sons. These they beseeched to caffythem across the water to the island. Having reached the island they car-ried the infant god to Aristaus, in his mountaintop cave. Here Aristausdispensed his knowledge of the arts to the local people. He received theinfant Dionysus from Ino's coffer, and reared him as his son with the as-sistance of beekeeping Dryades and Nymphs. He also received the assist-"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"ance of the maidens of the island, who presumably enacted this rite there,taking the part of the holy choir and nymphs.Aristaus is also mentioned by another Later wrirer, Nonnus of the 5'hcentury cr, whose epic poem the Dionysiaca deserves wider attention, Herecords a contest between Dionysus and Arisraus, in which the godscompared wine and honey. Dionysus is judged the winnea although Zeusadmires the honey and Apollo is jealous of the preference given his son'srival. Although late, Nonnus possessed incredible erudition, and the tra-dition appears to be old.It apparently records the triumph of wine over anolder intoxicant, honey-mead. By this reading, Aristaus represents trulyancient traditions assimilated by the Dionysian mysteries. His role in thepreservation of the god, as well as the death of Eurydice menrioned byVrgil, likely reflects this. The snake in this myth bears comparison withthe snake as a common emblem of heroes and the chthonic realm gener-aIIy.In the traditions of Boetia and Eubo ea, Aristxus and his daughterMacris reared the infant Dionysus. He was also associated with Silenusand Pan. In these'backward'local traditions Aristaus was rhe direct equiv-alent of Silenus, the mentor of Dionysus. In some traditions the figure ofSilenus is multiplied, and one of these alternative forms - called Sileni -was named Astraios, and was associated with Aristaus. The Aristaus ofThessaly, which is likely his original home, is very close in nature to Pan.In Thessaly Pan sometimes appeared as twin gods, the Panes Agreus andNomios. These un-Olympian traditions are the background of later my-thology; they thus provide interesting pointers to the nature of Aristaeus,but also the origins of the later gods. Evander is said to have introducedthe cult of Pan and Silenus to Italy, where they became the basis of thefestival named Lupercalia.According to a tradition recorded by a Byzantine scholiast a Giantnamed Aristaus was the only one of that race of archaic gods to survivethe war with the Olympians. The Giants and Titans are often confusedin Classical sources, and Aristaus may originally be aTitan and son ofOuranos. The only male Titan to survive their war with the Olympians,according to Classical myth, is Prometheus. Aristaus survived as he was"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"hidden by Gaia, goddess of Earth, at Mount Etna in Sicily in the shapeof a giant dung beetle (Aitnaios kantharos). Of chis Suidas says: the freof beaven did not reacb him, nor did Etna barm bim. Akhough very likelyal,ate Hellenistic tradition, there arc many interesting aspects to this ac-count. Firstly, the connection with the beetle places Aristaus in the con-text of the systems of correspondences evolved in Alexandria; in these thebeetle is a symbol of the Zodiacal sign of Cancer. In symbolism of moreancient date, the crab was associated with the Telchines, and its pincerswith the tongs of magical metalworkers. The first places Aristaus in themagical traditions of late antiquity, and connects him with Hermes as theOlympian ruler of the Sign. The latter suggests links to Cabiric societiesand rites such as that on Hephastus' island of Lemnos. The connectionwith Etna is also significant: Typhon, also of the race of Giants was buriedbeneath itby Zeus. Possibly these are related themes, with Gaia's preser-vation of Aristaeus and Typhons supposed captivity there being earlierand later versions of the same story. That Hephrstus had his forge thereis also important, he was assisted by the Cyclopes, likely identical withthe giants in the pre-Olympian. Etna is also associated with the cult ofPersephone, and forms part of the legend of Empedocles.The motives of various later authors in reviving the fortunes of the ar-chaic god Aristaus are obscure. That they succeeded in placing consider-able emphasis on him is inescapable. What is certain is that the state cultof the Olympians had undergone a decline in this period, and the olderchthonic rites experienced a renaissance, enlivened by their adoption bythe now resurgent Orphic and Pphagorean cults.Aristaus was credited with planting sylphion in Libya, chis sacred plantfigures in the legend of Phormion and his meeting with the Dioscuri. Theplant, a form of fennel, is now extinct, but was an effective oral contracep-tive in great demand in the ancient world. He was also initiated into theMysteries of Dionysus, and according to some accounts accompanied himon his conquest of India. The involvement of Aristaus in the myths ofApollo, in company with Hermes, Orpheus and Dionysus, is highly sig-nificant. There are indications that the cult of Apollo underwent signifi-cant changes, along with the nature of the oracle at Delphi. The oracle was263"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAoriginally chthonic. That a god whose nature was at least partly chthonicwas associated or identical with the original Apollo, prior to changes atDelphi, is also a strong possibility. That Aristaus appears to have begunhis career in Thessaly, to becom e, frnally, a deity of a Greek colony in Libyais strongly reminiscent of the route of Apollonius'Argonautica. His his-tory concludes with a mysterious disappearance, near another mounrainwith associations with Typhon. This was Mount Hamus, which sepa-rates Thrace and Thessaly; appropriate for a rural god worshipped equallyby Thracians and Greeks.SilenusHaving thus far introduced Aristaus, it is well to consider the god Silenus,easily overlooked as a minor character in later mythology. Whether Greekor Latin, Hellenistic poets with their rural idyll were very fond of nymphs,shepherds, and of course satyrs. Pan, Silenus and other characters, includ-ing Aristaus were undoubtedly revived - and to a degree reinvented - atthis time, but some very serious attention to earlier myth was also in-volved, concerning Dionysus as well as Pan. In this context older satyrswere frequently referred to as Sileni, but the prototype of them all wasSilenus himself,, the constant companion of Dionysus (or Bacchus as hewas otherwise known), his mentor and foster -father. In common withthe other satyrs the father of Silenus was generally said to be Hermes.Hermes birth and rapid growth in a cave already connecr him with theDionysian formula. According to others Silenus was the son of Pan him-self, who like Hermes was a god of shepherds. This is curious, since thisraises the likelihood of Pan and Silenus mirroring rhe Thessalian doublePanl perhaps with Silenus the younger of the two. The myth may wellrecord a more primitive tradition of divine kingship - very much on rhemodel of the Thracian Hero - with Pan and Silenus, and then Silenusand Dionysus being the roles of older and younger dynasts.Another tradition has Silenus born from a drop of the blood ofOuranus when mutilated by Kronos. This may be a clue ro rhe older na-ture of Silenus, as Aphrodite resulted from the same attack. There are also26+"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"some very odd resemblances berwee;\"\"- \"nd Aphrodite'.s husband inolympian myth, the god Hephastus. other accounrs of his parentage alsoexist, and accounts of his birrhplace are also varied. According to some hewas born at Malea at Lesbos, the wine from that region being famous inantiquity. Others had him born at Nysa, like Dionysus, bur there are atleast ten possible places of that name to choose from. of these one of themost significant is on the coast of Euboea, placing it in the Dionysianmyth of Aristaus. Another Nysa was placed in Ethiopia, although curi,ously enough this name was supposedly once applied to Lesbos.Silenus was at one point a warer deity of Lydia, a god of springs andrunning water. As is common with water deiries, including nymphs, hewas also a prophetic god. This accounts for King Midas lacing a springwith wine in order to extracr a prophecy from Silenus. His origin in AsiaMinor also explains why he plays an important parr in myths involvingPhrygia. The Dionysus of this rnythic line is the Phrygian Dionysus,Saba2ius, rather than the Cretan, Thracian or odrer Dionysus, althoughthese tend to be combined in the comprehensive Iiterary accounts.According to one such myth, while Dionysus is in Asia Minor Silenusbecame separated from his army, probably left behind while asleep.Phrygian peasants found him and took hin-r to king Midas, the king knewwho he was because he was an initiate of the Mysteries. He was much tak-en with his guest and entertained him for ten days. On rerurning Silenusto Dionysus the god was so pleased that he offered Midas whatever gifthe desired, which was rhe occasion of Midas asking that all he touchedturned to gold. When even his food was so aflected he requested Dionysusto remove the fatal gift, and was insrructed to bathe in the source of theriver Pactolus near Mount Tmolus (important in Dionysian rnyth, andrich in gold). That Phrygia was rich in gold undeniably plays a role in theformation of this myth, but there is much ro suggesr a religious and rirualcontext for the myth itself. A variant of this parr of the myth places Midasin a desert where the only fountain is spouting gold, and Dionysus granrshis request to change it to warer. While gold undeniably excites men's in-terest in these stories, the connection with water is more important tounderstanding the narure of the deities concerned.

The setting of the meering of Midas andSilenus described above for example is notable. The Satyr was broughtbound in flowers to Midas in his rose gardens. These were located onMount Bromion or Bermicn in Macedonia, where traditionally Midaswas king of the Briges prior to his leading the migration to Asia Minorwhere they became the Phrygians. These rose gardens are recorded as anatural phenornena by Herodotus, who mentions the occasion in passing.Tbe Vision oJ Al,olloAfter leaving Phineus the Argonauts accomplished the passage betweenthe Clashing Rocks by following the instructions of the seer, and were6lled with confidence. They passed now into the Black Sea, where noGreek mariner had gone before. They travelled across open sea oppositethe coast of Bithynia. After a day and nighr of labouring ar the oars theydrew into harbour at the island of Thynias. Here they saw a vision ofApollo. He appeared to them as a mighty andbeautiful god, with his goldfowing locks, bearing a silver bow in his hand and having a quiver slungon his back. However, this was no mere ethereal presentiment, the earthquaked as he stepped upon the island, and the waves surged mightily athis passing. The context of this vision is importanr, for Apollo did notdwell always at one place. He was now travelling from Lycia, home of thefiery mountain of Hephastus, ro rhe land of Hyperborea, which is clearlyidentified here with the land of the Scythians, North of the Black Sea.This was likely his original home, for the Scyrhians had long ago invadedAsia Minor, and may have brougl-rt his worship with them.Beneath the surface of Classical mythology, there is much mystery con-cerning Apollo. In his Classical form he is taken as embodying everything"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"later civilisations admired about the Greeks. Yet if anything about him isclear it is that this form was rhe product of layer after layer of superim-position. Take for example his association with the Sun, a major aspect ofhis nature in the later period. This apotheosis is achieved at the expenseof the earlier Sun god, Helios.In Homer there is absolutely no trace of hissolar nature, which dates to around 4oo BCE. Indeed, our first glimpse ofhim in thelliad is not as a bringer of light, but of plague. The inconsisten-cies surrounding Apollo are evident at every rurn. The closer we look themore the older traditions and attributes concerning him clash with thelater developments. To take the simplest of these contradictory elements,why should a supposed Sun god have a silver bow as one of their majorattributesi Surely if such a symbol is suggestive of either of the luminar-ies it is the Mooni Reaching deeper into the mysrery, his other major at-tribute is the lyre. This instrumenr, as has been mentioned several rimes,was thought to be more civilised than the flute, which was associated withorgiastic cults among the barbarians. The civilised notions he came ro rep-resent were stately, while the cults of the barbarians were associated withfrenzy and loss of control. Yet Apollo is the god associated with prophecyin a state of frenzy.A famous underground necromanreion, at Hieropolis in Phrygia, wassited beneath a temple of Apollo. The necromanteion however was norserved by a Pythoness or by priests of Apollo, but by priests of Cybele.This is a striking departure from the usual image of Apollo, and given hisimportant relationship with seers and Sibyls the darker side of the godrequires urgent clarificadon.The god Apollo in the Classical world (and to alarge extent in the laterHellenistic world) is the god of light, reason and the civilised arts. Thereis however no trace of this in Homer, where the role of Sun god is whollythat of Helios. It is true that his ancient link with prophecy - a form ofdivine madness - was retained in Classical Greece. However his new im-age conflicts strongly with the old. His public relations makeover madehim the icon of the new social model; more recently this image was en-dorsed by both Muller and Nietzsche as the original form, but the evi-dence against rhis is compelling.267"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAOur 6rst introduction to Apollo in Homer is as the infictor of plagueon the camp of the Greeks. His arrows bring disease, striking animals,then men, so that foul charnel 6res smoke throughout the camp.

Connected, like Dionysus, to Greek traditions involving initiationsof youths into adulthood, he nevertheless has powerful connections withMiddle Eastern deities. This is not to be sought at Delos, where the cultof Artemis clearly preceded his; and while he has srrong connecrions withLycia in Asia Minor this might originate in Greek colonisation. Thoughthese connections are important, Apollo's relations with Middle Easterndeities are based on sounder footing elsewhere.Apollo's plague bearing arrows connecr him to the Semitic god Reshef,,a god of war and pestilence among the Syrians; adopted also by theEgyptians. His arrows are frrel>rands, and his name is connecred withburning by fire or lightning. Reshef was worshipped at Ugarit and inCyprus where several inscriptions link him unequivocally with Apollo;indeed Apollos epithet Amyclaeus appears to derive from rhar of Reshef(A)Mykal. There may be a link too in Apollo's slaying of Python and asimilar dragon slaying legend from Ugarir concerning Reshef, As suchReshef is the forerunner of both Apollo and the angel Michael, for bothof whom the attribution to the Sun is a later development. Scholars havefound reference to Reshef - perhaps on his way ro becoming Michael- in the biblical Book of Habakkul< where RSbF (pestilence) accompaniesJehovah in a mythic battle (Habbakkuk 3:5) and a bow is specifically men-tioned (zrg).InDeuteronomy 3z:z4Jehovah sends Reshef against his en-emies; inPsqlms z8:+8 Reshef destroys the flocks of enemies.Both Reshef and a bow-bearing Hittite guardian deity, associated likeApollo with a stag, are connected with Apollo's evolution during the DarkAges.

Nearby was located a Cavern of Hades, an impor-tant necromanteion where necromantic rites were celebrarcd in order toconsult the dead. As wirh the necromanteion ar Cuma and Thesprotia,here too was the mouth of a river named Acheron, one of the rivers of theunderworld, which - like olympus - had several earthly counrerparts.Itwas across this river that the souls of the dead were ferried.

Heracles had come among them at the time of the funeral ritesof Lycus'brother, Priolas.

He was raised in a distant place, referred toas Mount Nysa, the true whereabouts of which remain mysterious despitemany claims to be its home. The various stories all concur in making hima foreign god who arrived from abroad, and who indeed travelled overmost of the world as an unconventional but unstoppable congueror.There are some inconsistencies to this account, fur example there arevery early references to Dionysus in Mycenaean times. Some have arguedthat Dionysus evolved considerably after this point, partly based on thesliglrt treatrnent accorded him in Homer. This is not entirely satisfactory,as Homer had no reason to enlarge on his account, and as an aristocraticpoet may not have wished to.It has also been argued that Homer did notknow him as a wine god. However, the two references to Dionysus onLinear B tablets from Pylos do appear to involve this role. Interestingly,the Homeric LIymns have the hymn to Dionysus in first place, althoughunfortunately only a fragnrent remains. That some evolution did takeplace - change is his nature and typical of his cults - is not in question.Nor are tl-re foreign influences on his cult; with the proviso that grass-roots Greek religion may have had more in common rvith these in the firstplace than with the approved state cultus.After being born from the thigh of Zeus, Dionysus was entrusted tothe care of Hermes; or in other accounts that of Persephone or Rhea, Hewas then taken to the royal pair Athamas and Ino of Orchomenos; theywere instructed to raise hin-r disguised as a girl. Incidentally it rvas fromthe court of this pair that Phrixus had fled on the ram with the GoldenFleece. This androgynous upbringing was also a feature of the myth ofthe hero Achilles. The supposed re:rson for this disguise was to deceiveHera, who had already caused the death of Semele and wished to destroyDionysus. Hera discovered the ruse and drove his guardians insane.It wasthen that Zeus entrusted his son to the nymphs of Mount Nysa, namedBacche, Bromie, Erato, Macris and Nysa. He took the further precautionof disguising l)ionysus as a young goat. This last detail likely originatesin attempts to account for the goat fbrm of the god. Despite this the goatsacrifice in his cult was later misinterpreted and rationalised as destroyingan enemy of the vine, rather than the ritual death of the god himself."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"]PHIAThe nymphs of Nysa raised him in a cave, feeding him on honey.

Other versions of the origin of this constellation may re-fect similar cult origins, connected ro rhe death of Hyas or of Phaethon;nurses, slayers and mourners in a ritual context can be represented bythe same persons at different times. According to Homer's account theThracian king Lycurgos persecuted Dionysus and his nurses upon MountNysa. Dionysus fed and took refuge with the sea goddess Thetis, just asHephaestus had done when cast from Mount Olympus. The resemblanceof these stories is remarkable, and is far from being the only point of con-tact between the myths of Dionysus and Hephastus.It was when Dionysus grew into an effeminate youth that he discoveredthe vine. Hera then drove hirn mad; her capacity for rhis in Greek myth isunending and may be a clue to her real nature. Taking with him the ben-efits of the vine, he wandered insane throughout Egypt and Syria, whichpart of his myth also explains the existence of similar cults in those areas,those of Osiris and Adonis in particular. He wandered the world over,accompanied by his mentor Silenus, with a great army of mythologicalbeings and his faithful Manads.These female followers were known variously as Manads, Bacchanres,Mimallonides, Bassarides and Thyiades, mostly names representing theirdress and actions.

All their acrionsand demeanour resembled madness, a sacred delirium reverenced as holyinspiration.With these companions, as well as the satyrs and numerous orhers,Dionysus wandered madly over the face of the earth. In Libya he is saidto have met the Amazons, more likely goatskin-clad priestesses of a lo-cal cult. These he persuaded to assist him in a march on Egypt. Afterhis victory there he marched through Mesopotarnia, crossing the Tigrisand descending upon India. Wherever he went he was victorious, and merlittle opposition, nation after nation surrendering joyously ro the bearerof wine. This universal acclaim however was not always shared by kings,several of whom he brought to an unpleasant death. The formulaic ex-planation in each case is their conservatism and rejection of his divinity.Due to this element of the myth some modern commenrators like ro seein these deaths echoes of violent clashes between the cult of Dionysusand more orderly religious forms. The likelihood is, at least in part, thattheir deaths are mythic rather than historic. In this case they refer to thearchaic practice of human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism; the slain kingrepresenting Dionysus himself. On the other hand actual confict withstate cults - both Greek and Roman - featured in the later history ofthe Dionysian rites. Dionysus is pre-eminently'the god of the exceptionaliand the rise of the individual in Greek society was marked by the rise ofprivate Dionysian cults, practicing initiation, admitting both sexes, andwith no centralised authority.He was saved from his madness by expiatory purifications and initia-tion into the Mysteries of Cybele, a detail often omitted in accounts ofthe god. The wildness and abandon that distinguished the rites of bothdeities is but one aspect of their close association.

The Cretan account of the deathof Zeus - his gr^ve was seen by Pythagoras at the time of his initiation -was rejected elsewhere in the Greek world. At least that is the irnpressionfrom the literary record, which of course tells little of the private cultsand associations and the older rural cults. The evidence for an early dateis inconclusive, but it is likely part of the original mytl-r cycle and was cer-tainly important and influential, for example upon Orphisrn.

It is interesting to observe thatthe form the god takes for this divine coupling is that of a snake; suggest-ingZeus Chthonios or Hades.As with the above form of the myth, the child * actually the juvenileform of Zeus - was persecuted by the jealous Hera and at her instigationthe Titans sought his death. He assumed many disguises to escape them,adopting finally the form of a bull, in which form they tore him to pieces.The name of the Titans is said to be derived from the white gypsum withwhich his slayers whitened their faces. This whitening of the face was afeature of the initiation rites celebrated in his honour, in which first a wardance was perfomed guarding the god, and then a bull was torn apart andconsumed raw. In ritual contexts therefore the Titans who slew him areidentical \"vith his guards the Curetes (it is no coincidence that there isboth a Titan and a Curete named Melisseus). In the myth Zeus slew theTitans with a thunderbolt, and from the smoke that arose from their bod-ies the race of men came into existence, The nature of man was thus taint-ed with the substance of the Titans, but also contained the spark of thedivine from the body of Dionysus which they had devoured.

This is a unique occurrence of intimate identification ofthe human and the divine in Greek religion. The doctrine of the Titanicnature of man and the divine spark within formed the basis of Orphic re-demptive ideas; it is this idea which underlay their purification rites.

Hewas commonly described as a son of Cybele or Rhea, probably indicatingthat after aniving in Asia Minor the Thracian god had been identifiedwith Attis, the son and lover of the indigenous goddess. Like Cybele andHecate his rites were only celebrated at night, which may well indicateancient connections with Hittite religion. His nocturnal mysteries weretermed Sabazia, and may have given their name to the Sabbats of thewitches. These rites, termed orgia, were particularly wild, disorderly andaccording to their critics, debauched. That Phrygian orgiawere renownedfor being far wilder than approved Graco-Roman rites is undoubted, butthe purely sexual connotations of the term orgy in our times is a reduc-tion of the original meaning. Orgia involved ftenzied dance, drumming,the obtaining of ecstatic states and other energetic celebrations. Theseexhausting activities earned these rites the name orgia which means workand refers to the energy and effort involved compared to more stately cer-emonial or sober sacrifices.Sabazius was called the son of Zeus and Persephone, and considered tobe more ancient than the son of Zeus and Semele in the Classical form.The serpent played a major role in his rites, andZeus is said to have takenserpent form to father him on Persephone. Another myth has Sabaziushimself take serpent form in order to mate with one of his Phrygianpriestesses, by whom children were conceived.

For one thing hisname is known from Mycenaean inscriptions; along with Zeus and oth-er'Greek' gods. Some deities from this period did not survive inro theClassical period; making Dionysus one of the older Greek gods ratherthan a later import. His cult, under whatever name, was also present inMinoan Crete. These are the early levels of Greek civilisation and reli-gion, and in this sense Dionysus is at least as narive as rhe Olympians.Despite this, in Greece and wherever he is found, foreign-ness is an im-portant part of his identity. That there are foreign elements involved inthe character of Dionysus and of his rites is not disputed. However, theorigins of Aphrodite in Syria and Cyprus, and Hepl-rzstus in Lemnos andAsia Minor, does not bestow on them a foreign identity in Greek myth.Examination of the origins and pre-Classical identity of Dionysus or ofthe other gods always involves other cultures. With Dionysus however,otherness is not only part of the historical background, but apart. of hisdivine nature at all times and places.Dionysus appears twice in the Odyssey, and the occasions are important.The first is in the eleventh book, occasionally referredto as the NecromancyoJ'Homrr,The second, in the z4'h book, is no less connected with the un-derworld. In the 6rst half of this book Hermes guide of souls ushers thespirits of the slain suitors into Hades. In a conversation between heroesof the Trojan War it is mentioned that the urn in which Achilles' remainswere placed was a gift of Dionysus, forged by Hephasrus."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Classical Dionysus is undoubtedly a cornposite of numerous deities.In this he differs little from - say - Zeus, who assimilated various divinefigures from the Mediterranean and Middle Easr. Due to this processthere are many variations to tl-re form of his myth, reflecting Phrygian,Cretan, Athenian, Peloponnesian and other traditions. The closely relatedBoetian and Euboean traditions represent a particularly important localvariant, connecting with Silenus and particularly with Aristaus. Elementsof this Boetian form - in which no blasting of Semele occurs - are rep-resented in the Dionysiaca of Nonnus; given in the accounr of Aristaus.Another important aspect of Euboean tradition is their relation to ItalianCuma, which had the title Euboicus, as the city was said to have beenfounded partly by Euboean colonists from Calchis.The mother of Dionysus in the Classical legend is Semele, a morralwoman; she is identified as a daughter of Cadmus. This family is said tohave been Phoenician in origin, and likely indicates Asiatic origins to theBoetian form of the legend. She has been tentatively identified with thePhrygian earth goddess Zemelo. Her rerurn from Hades therefore wasnot as a slain woman rescued by her divinised son, bur a goddess of similarnature to Persephone. This is also the likely origin of the supposed deathand resurrection of Eurydic e, wife of Orpheus.

Io! Io! Euoe! Iacche! Io Bacche! Euobe!Behind them came others bearing sacred vessels, including one of purewater. Behind these came young girls carrying baskets of fruits; some oiwhich contained serpents. Behind these came the phallophoroi or phallusbearers, a feature also of the rites of Osiris, said to have been brought toGreece by Melampus. These men sang festive songs and were crownedwith ivy and violets and masked with herbs. Behind them processed othermen know n as ithuphalloi, with drunken gestures and gait; these dressedin women's apparel striped in white and reaching to the ground, theirheads garlanded and their hands gloved in flowers. Behind these cametheliknoltboroi or liknon bearers; the liknon was a winnowing fan or longhandled basket for separating grain from chaff, and an important emblemof the god.The festivals of Dionysus or Bacchus were wild affairs, although notwithout a sombre aspect as be6ts a chthonic rite. They were also deeplyegalitarian, both slaves and children took Part. In the period of the socalled tyrants, when aristocratic rule was cuftailed, the Dionysian ritesreceived a major boost from the new rulers as a means of courting popularsupporr.It has been supposed that the Witches Sabbath received its namefrom anrique festivals of Sabazius.

The passage occurs in his 39'h Book, and is partmoralising 6ction, but amongst other evidence an inscription of a senato-rial decree shows the events it purports to describe are historical. Shorrlyafter the conclusion of the Punic Wars, in 186 BcE, the Senate violentlysuppressed a Bacchic association throughout ltaly, with over six thousandexecutions. The reasons for the pogrom were evidently to impose totalsenatorial control on religious expression throughout Italy and the prov-inces. Livy's introduction of the episode, though part literary convention,contains some interesting elements:A low-born Greek went into Etruria fir$t of all, but did not bring withhim any of rhe numerous arrs which rhar mo$t accomplished of all na-tions has introduced arnongft us for the culrivation of mind and body.He was ahedge-priest and wizard, not one of those who imbue men'sminds with error by professing to teach their superStitions openly formoney, but a hierophant of secret no&urnal my$teries.Here we see a plain echo of Plato's description of goetes as wanderingmagicians, at least some of whom were driven by genuine religious con-viction. Other elements of his account match the thrust of the Senate'sdecree.

However, there are numerous less well knownand plainly archaic variants, evidence from images on Greek vases, andother indicators. These reveal several of the familiar details to have beenrefashioned from older material, in many cases quite drastically alteringthe original meaning. Much the same applies to Hephastus, whose originwas not Greek at all. These traditions have led some scholars proposingthe likely hypothesis that Prometheus was an older form of Hephastus.Firstly, the tradition that Prometheus made mankind from clay, in com-mon not only with theJewish creator bur the Egyptian Ptah. Against thiswe have the production of the 6rst woman (comparable to Eve, who alsosupposedly causes misfortune to descencl on Man), also with clay, Thisis perfbrmed by Hephastus, in tandem with Athena, who, incidentally,was not always the eternal virgin as portrayed in Classical Athenian rnyth.On the contrary she was anciently partnered with Hephastus, who inOlympian myth was portrayed as the cuckolded husband of Aphrodite.Lnages of Hephastus and Athene were commonly found in the houses ofAthenians, beside the hearths, reflecting their ancient relationship.From Aesop and other traditions of Asia Minor it is apparent thatPrometheus was the fashioner of animals, such as the lion. Thus the origi-nal myth probably represented him making both rnale and female, humanand animal. The making of human beings with clay is one resemblancebetween Heph,rstus and Prometheus, not to mention Ptah. Another suchresemblance is more revealing. There is a legend in which Athena is bornfrom the forehead of Zeus.In order for this to happen a bronze axe, apowerful religious syrnbol o[ the archaic period, is made by Hephzsrus.In the best known version of the story Hephzstus then opens the headof Zeus and Athena springs forth armed and fully formed. Naturally, inorder for this emergence from his head to occur, Zeus has to be absolutelycolossal. In acldicion of course, there has to be a god Hephrstus. This isimpossible if the myth of Hera producing him without male interventionin respons e to Zeus producing Athena is accepted at face value. This high-lights the other tradition, wherein it is Prometheus who opens the headof Zeus, The colossal size of Zeus, and the interrelations of the two 6re289"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIAgods takes us deeper below the surface of Classical mythology. In relatingthe legend of Cybele mention was made of goddesses of colossal size, andof acts of violence suffered by them. One depiction of such events has anenormous female head emerging from the earrh, attacked on eirher sideby two male frgures, usually satyrs. A variant, on a vase now in Oxford,depicts Pandora emerging, crowned, from the earrh. Approaching her,armed with an axe, is Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus. As in manysuch images above her head is another smailer divine figure, in this caseEros. Plainly Father Zeus has been substituted for the Earth Goddessin this adaptation to an Olympian and Arhenian agenda. Note also thatwhen Prometheus'stole' the fire from the forge of Hephasrus, Athenawas working there with him. A similar reversal has occurred in relationto Pandora, whereas in the Olympian legend the gods give her gifts, hername means giver of all; a title of the Earth.A fact of very grear. significance in the Promethean myth is that duringthe period of his painful punishment he withholds a porent and mysteri-ous secret ftom Zeus. The grandeur and nobiliry of Prometheus' defi-ance is truly awe inspiring. Cherishing his secret throughout his ordealhe contemplates the end of Zeus'tyranny; for from Thetis - a sea nymphloved by Zeus - will be born a son greater than his father. This themecuriously recurs in relation to two apparently disdnct characters; Achilleson the one hand - who like Jason is a hero of Thessaly - and Dionysuson the other. In the Orphic myth of Dionys us Zagreus he was fated to bethe successor of Zeus and the fifth ruler of the world. Aeschylus porrraysevents in a spirit consistent with Olympian orchodoxy; Zeus averted hisoverthrow by allowing a mortal to mate with Thetis who gives birth toAchilles. The'Promethean successor' however could as readily be seen asDionysus (during whose festivals, after aII, the dramas of Aeschylus werefirst presented and enacted).Before closing this examination of the fourth book of the ArgonauticaI wish to mention a mysterious fact concerning Prometheus. Sophoclesin Oedipus at Colonus sets his pLay at a cult site primarlly dedicated to theErinyes, important underworld deities who were discussed earlier in rhischapter. This was not however the sole dedicarion of rhe place. Sophocles"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"was born at Colonus and according to his testimony other divine frgureswere also associated with the site.It was owned dually by Poseidon, whoserole as god of the sea was an Olympian simplification of his earlier nature;and Prometheus, Lord of Fire. Also associated with the site was a hero onhorseback, curiously reminiscent of the iconography of the Thracian hero,from whom Colonus took its name. This is a most intriguing concatena-tion of divine frgures which in Classical myth seem to have little to dowith one another.This is only the case in considering the gods in classical rather thanarchaic form. Poseidon was anciently partnered with Demeter Erinys.His role at sites associated with underworld figures is therefore naturalenough to his pre-Olympian status, and he is in fact the Patron of a fa-mous necromantic oracle.

Heroes were of course ancestral figures origi-nally, prior to becoming Patrons of cities. Prometheus according to someauthors was the father of a hero named Hellen, the ancestor of all theGreeks. Additionally, the closeness - to the point of inter-changeabilityon occasion - of Prometheus to Hephastus, who was honoured with ch-thonic rites, shows the dedications of the site to form a unified whole.Although Euripides has been accused of magnifying the importance ofthe site and elaborating on its dedications, the relations between these ap-parently disparate figures are in fau. perfectly harmonious."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"GOETIC GALLERY: ORPHICAOlenn LEN, A poET - said to be from Hyperborea - who fourished be-t I fore the time of Orpheus.

Thereis a frequently encountered idea in Plato that poetry was a form of holymadness superior even to Socratic logic, involving the intervention of agod. This form of mania was linked with the Muses, as the other formsof holy madness were linked with Aphrodite (love), Dionysus (wine) andApollo (prophecy). Some scholars have gone out of their way to Provethat classical Greek poets were in full possession of their senses whencomposing or reciting. On occasion their arguments approach the farci'cal. There is, after all, equally little proof that all Greek lovers were rollingtheir eyes and frothingat the mouth in a state of divine possession. Onthe other hand there is ample proof that the Greeks associated poetry andprophesying; consid eringthem divine in origin. It is plain that poetry anddivination were both considered separate from both reason and day to dayconsciousness, even allowing for the role of defrnable technique and per-sonal effort. It is plain too that the composition of poetry, attuning onesmind to special language and metre, involves a mode of consciousnessdistinct from the norm. The Greek term ecstasy means standing outsideoneself,, while enthusiasm meant possessed or inspired by a god; both ofthese terms are appropriate to the poetic state of mind.One of the Greek words for magician was epodos, meaning a singer ofmagical incantations. Archilochus, a poet of Paros who flourished 685 sccwas proud to be an itinerant follower of Dionysus. His satires were inher-ently magical, one such - recited at a feast of Demeter which favouredsuch license - is said to have caused the victims to hang themselves.Another of his adventures is strongly reminiscent of the folktale of Jackand the Beanstalk, rcIatinghow he took a cow to market, but met on theway the Muses, who vanished after taking his cow in exchange for a|yre.He introduced new forms of Dionysian worship, which were disapprovedby the citizens of Paros, but vindicatedby Apollo, a circumstance whichsounds suspiciously Orphic."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"GEOSOPHIASince the Muses are significant to this topic music too should be considered.Pindar, a poet himself (and incidenrally not an admirer of Archilochus),founded a cult of the Mother specialising in music therapy,and some ideaof its operation are probably implicit in rhe 5'h cenrury writings attributedto Hippocratesr lf tbe sick man bellows or has conuulsions, they say that theGreat Mother is resytonsible.

Like later magicians, these practitioners had special modes of dis'posal for the remains of their treatment. Ritual residues could be buried inthe earth, cast into the sea or taken to remote places where they would notbe touched or trodden on. In the work of Pindar music appropriate to oneor other deity was used as a therapeutic aid in fteating such conditions.These ideas concerning sickness and its treatment have strong affinitieswith both magic and with ecstatic religions which include possession aspart of their worldview. Like such religions the wandering priesrs wouldalso have used music, likely infuenced by their cult ieaningsr the lyre forOrpheus and the prophetic god Apollo, che pipe and drum for Dionysusand the Great Mother.It should also be borne carefully in mind that right into the time ofImperial Rome divinatory methods, as well as hymns and religious songs,were associated with poetry.

Long afterthese early references to wandering magicians possessing magical books,these same traditions remained potent at a popular level and in privateassociations."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"V{PLICATIONS FOR MODERN PRACTICEMagical Weap ons empowered by SpiritsThroughout Book Four and elsewhere in this volume are encounteredmagical weapons and talismanic creations made by Hephastus and thefire wielding Chalybes. At its simplest the frery deities, magicians andspirits are associated directly with magical weaPons. As the readet of TheTrue Grimoire will be aware, the equipment for oPerating that notorioushandbook of black magic is specifically marked with the sigils of variousdaimons from its hierarchy. While excePtional compared to other grimoi-res, the association between the weapons and spirits inTbe True Grimoirebecomes perfect\\y intelligible in this light. Given that the grimoire empha-sises the Salamanders or fire spirits, these magically emPowered weap-ons readily connect with those made by the Chalybes or Telchines. It isimportant to realise that these are at once ancestor magicians and spiritsinvoked by living magicians. In the paradigm revealed here the magicalhero is enlisted among the underworld spirits when their work in life iscompleted. In the meantime the magician invokes the aid of these spiritswhen making magical weapons, and by implication, when wielding them.Oils and HerbsThe making of libations and other uses of magical oils offers alternativesto animal sacrifice, just as Orphism substituted incense for blood offer'ings, with the exception of the initiation rites into the Mysteries. Thishowever is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, in the overall agenda of thecurrent study. The precedents set in ancient Greece for ritual use of rnagi'cal oils offers avery direct way of integrating'Hoodoo methodologies di-rectly into modern goetia.The making of Hoodoo oils involves methods readily mastered by themodern magician, without any necessity for complex alchemical proce-dures.

The mixture is then pounded, steeped and shaken in thesame way. When the operator is satisfied with the results tlre oil is thenstrained and the solid matter is disposed of ritu ally, for example depositedat a crossroads.Although some modern purveyors of such oils substitute other oils, useof an olive oil base is both tradicional and appropriate in this context, forreasons which should be abundantly clear. One of the most appropriatehoodoo oils for our purposes is that known as Power Oil. This oil is usedfor anointing to increase personal power, on both the magicians body andon talismans or ritual items involved with psychic power and spiritual de-velopment. The ingredients added to this oil are lemon - either peel orflowers - and frankincense; both solar in nature according to Westerncorrespondences, and thus appropriate co Apollo or to Helios, patronsof the Greek goetic magicians. Use in anointing, dressing of candles or asa poured libation is appropriate in almost any context with the spirits ofthe grimoire.Personal research into herbs and oils, through both conventional corre-spondences and their ancient associations with gods and spirits, will takethe operator further than the tabulated listing here. Care should obviouslytaken with plants whose properties are either toxic or unknown, but thepotential for expanded and enhanced praxis implicit in this area shouldnot be underestimated.296"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Herbal Correspondences oJ'some Wrum SpiritsSPIRIT STAR MINERAL PLANTANIMALFlerity Algol Diamond Black Hellebore, MugwortFlerity Pleiades U;?1,,\"\", Frankincense, FennelBelzebuth Aldebaran lllJ;\"., Lady's Thistle, WoodruffSargatanas capella sapphire ffi#:d' Mint' Mugwort'Asraroth sirius Beryl ',ilt:r\"t Mugwort' Dragons To'gue of aSNAKCAstaroth procyon Agate i:ffi1-arigold'Musisin Regulus Garnet Sallendine, Mugwort, MasticFrimost Alkaid Lodestone X:,m\"chicory' Flowers of Toorh of a wolfKrepo,h Gienah l\"?:-,ilfi,, il:::}\";3;rtl'ilfi *;r\"\"\"'Khil spica Emerald. sage' Trifoil' Periwi'kle'Mugwort, Mar-rdrakeKhil Arcturus Jasper PlantainClisthert Alphecca Topaz Trifoil,Ivy, RosemaryHiepacr Anrares ?:1y.: Long Arisrolochia, SaffronAmethysrFrucissiere Vega Chrysolite Succory, FumiroryMorair ffi:l charccdon, Miffi:]il't\"*orr' Nip'"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Papyrus parallelsAnother connection between the papyri and the grimoires lies in thefield of aggressive love magic.

It is not uncommon to encounter modern magiciansclaiming that the Christian formula in the grimoires deny them ro paganmagicians. However, the use of herbs, minerals and animal parts through-out the genre may readily be traced ro pagan authorities such as Pliny.The christianisation of the materials shows rather the dependency of thegrimoires on pagan originals, and is readrly reversed should the operatorprefer.The use of the magner in Hoodoo is best exemplified by Magnet Oil.The manufacture of this oil involves firstly the feeding of the stones withiron frlings, so that they become'furry'. The two magnets are preferablyone rounded and one long, representing the sexes, and are steeped in oilcornplete with their fur. The steeping process is much as with herbs, inthat the magnets are kept in the oil for several days, and shaken once ortwice a day. After a week the oil is taken off and used as a base in themanufacture of other oils - such as Power Oil - or by itself. The magnetsmeanwhile are then buried in dirt taken from a crossroads, in order ro resrand recover their power. This process, similarly, is extended over severaldays, after which the magners are rcady ro use again in the making ofmagical oils.Given the relevance of both magnets and iron to the themes of thiswork, this process has much ro comfirend it in modern goeric practice.The associations of both these magical substances are rich and directlyconnected with goetic tradition.
