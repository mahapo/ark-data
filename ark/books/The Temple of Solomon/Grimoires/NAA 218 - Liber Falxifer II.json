Whereas we in the First Book placed great focus upon the folk-magical forms and practices that His Cult is masked by and initially revealed through, we will in this Second Book focus more upon the esoteric aspects of the Path, which in many ways are elevated far above the simpler and more open aspects of folk-sorcery, while still being firmly rooted in the fertile soil of such practices, as the strength of our Work and Tradition comprises in our correct employment of the simple, but both effective and authentic forms of nigromancy, in order to achieve the exalted goals of our Necrosophic Theurgy and Gnosticism. We will in this book, which is divided in three major parts, each holding certain subdivisions within themselves, disclose much and make available the Hidden Keys to even more, as that which is merely hinted at is as important, and often more so, as that which is clearly and openly outlined. This work is therefore not meant for the casual reader and is solely penned for the sake of those who through the demanding practices based upon the teachings already made available have entered His Cult, and as such it will yield its ripe and nourishing fruits only to those who have properly sowed their own seeds of Becoming upon the Cursed and Blessed Path of Nod. In the first part of this book we will touch upon many before unrevealed 11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"aspects of the Tradition, giving a clear account of the underlying foundation of our Qayinite system of thought, as expressed, according to our strategy, through the mythopoetic forms recognisable to those who have insights into the codifications of the Qabbala and the different branches of that which often has been labelled as Gnosticism. While the forms/words/symbols employed may be recognisable the essences they carry within this, our, context may be loaded with wholly different powers and meanings than the ones more commonly associated with them, thus the educated reader is warned not to mistake the covering for the actual substance. In the same first section also the mysteries of the Holy Mother will be partly disclosed, but as it is Her nature to keep Her veil for all but those very few who would be worthy of beholding Her Salvific Beauty and Light, more of substance will be presented in concealed than in revealed form and thus only the initial steps of the road leading to Her Garden of Roses will here be paved and the rest is left to the faithful to build upon, through direct and concrete contact with Her Soul and Spirit, via the means that through this book will be provided. In the second part of this book the mysteries approached in the First Book will be more fully entered into and different means and approaches will be made available to the ones that already have worked the Falx Belli cum. Here many new tools and techniques will be provided for the venerators of the Green Thorn-Crowned Skull and those who would seek to gain and utilise the benedictions and maledictions of the mighty Black In Green. Within this section of the book we will also provide many rites and formulae that can greatly aid the Qayinite sorcerer and once again that which is not openly given out will be hinted at and thus the traversing of the thorny tracks is hopefully made more attainable for those who would not hesitate to water the sowed fields with their own lifeblood. In the third part of the book we will open the ways to the most brilliant Light of the Mighty Dead and the densest darkness and obscurity of the Dark Dead, as in order to reach the zenith of the cross you must climb the steps at its nadir and in order to properly bless you must know perfectly how to curse.

The Zeroth divine essence encompassed itself within an unlimited Point of Unity, where all aspects of its Bornless and Deathless Non-Being and Being coexisted simultaneously, without any spatial or temporal restriction placed upon its Lawless Becoming. Within this Holy Chaos of the Pleroma of Unknowable Divinity All Was One and One Was All, In Nothingness. Within this state of Nihility and All-Potentiality the seeds of all manifestations and possibilities coexisted. Because of the all­encompassing and unrestricted Fullness of the Divinity within Ain, it came so to pass that a fraction of the whole became separated from the unity which in order to know itself fell outside of the Mindless Spirit of Divinity Within Ain. As this fraction sought to confine and know itself, it caused a division between its originally Paradoxical and Unbound facets and duality manifested within it in this state formed as the Ain Sof. Within this eternally conflicted manifestation one portion of it wanted to permanently separate itself from the Fullness of Emptiness, within which it had been Unlimited, but thus also unable to know any distinguished aspect of itself, while the other aspect instinctively sought to return to the Acausal state of its Primal Chaos, where Nothing and All was One and no division could limit its Eternal and Unrestricted Becoming. 17"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"These divided manifestations of the Divine became as beams of light emanating from this first point outside the Acausal Fullness of Ain and shone forth from that point of division as Two Contrasting Rays, one being the White Light of Restriction and the Other being the Black Light of Liberation. The White Light manifested on the one side of the void that had become after the separation from the Ain and manifested as the point of Ain Sof Aur, where it gathered its light in order to focus it towards its willed separated, confined and restricted manifestations, through which it designed to know itself. In contrast to this, the Black Light of the Divine manifested on the Other Side (Sitra Ahra) of the void caused by separation, and there manifested its first point as the Tohu, within which it wanted to reflect the Chaos of Ain and thus re-connect itself unto it. As a reaction to the limiting form-spawning impulses which it had separated itself from, it then manifested Bohu, in order to reflect and connect to the formlessness of the Abyssal Womb of the Ain and finally as a reaction to the White Light's manifestation of Ain Sof Aur the Black Light manifested Chasek, its eternal opposite. While the impulse of the White Light was separation, the Black Light instinctively sought unification and the Fullness that it once had been part of. Its opposition to the White Light was therefore not only motivated by the volition for separation from the White Light and its manifestations, but also caused by its Divine Will for unification and restoration of the Fullness of Emptiness. It was therefore its cause not to only return itself back to the unbound state of Ain, but also to bring back that fallen portion of the Divine manifested as the White Light. ��� The White Light gathered and focused within Ain Sof Aur, unknowing and uncaring of the Black Light that it had separated itself from, and in order to know its own separate parts it decreed for itself to emanate 18 ia a series of SOCXIIIIIIi point within Ain WI ad, for the sake t4. temporal Spiritual ... 1bus the True Fall ... upt \"'as caused till emanating and � the Divine Es.wncp;4j self-limiting and to .... that it was com� Light formed itself ..

Thus the True Fall of the Divine Spirit contained within the White Light was caused and commenced, but as the divine force was emanating and pouring downwards from Ain Sof Aur, a fraction of the Divine Essence contained within That Light awoke to its own self-limiting and to the sin of restriction against the Fullness of Divinity that it was committing. This small fraction of the awakened White Light formed itself into a Pearl of Wisdom and remained within Ain Sof Aur, while the rest of the White Light dimmed through its downward fall. On the Other Side of the void caused between the Divided Lights, the Divine within the Black Light observed the foolishness of the Fallen White Light and beheld that awakened Pearl of Spirit remaining within the Ain Sof Aur and longed for her, as it could see that the essence contained within the beautiful Pearl of Spirit was in harmony with its own longings for the Fullness-Emptiness of Ain. The Pearl of Wisdom also felt the connection to her unseen counterpart across the void between the divided lights and called out, as a lover to her betrothed, to the Divine Essence of the Black Light, for the sake of Reintegration, Restoration and Union. As the falling White Light manifested within the first sphere of being outside and below Ain Sof Aur, its eyes became more closed to the Acausal Divinity before and beyond its now isolated state of manifestation and there, in the sphere of Kether, it birthed itself as the Demiurge of its own creation and limitation. As the Demiurge awakened into being, he knew nothing but confusion and in its blind and forgetful state it declared itself as the One Divine. 19"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"From his throne of singularity the Demiurge then caused the downward succession of his essence and formed the spheres and elements of his own confinement and creation. Into each sphere produced below him he made out of his own Light of Creation multitudes of forms, beings, watchers, angels and rulers, all being aspects of his own essence, but separated from him in a way that allowed him to be the ruler of each. But, by each successive emanation, the Light and Spiritual essence contained within the spheres before and the spheres coming after became darker and darker, as the dispersion of the Fallen Divine Light caused a dilution of the spiritual essence within the whole of the creation. While the spheres and dungeons formed within these emanations below the Demiurge's throne on high, each cell within this creation became filled with prisoners fooled into believing themselves to be guards and rulers, and by the restricting power of the Number Ten the Demiurge encircled and bound both himself and all that had emanated from him. The Demiurge waxed in darkness of ignorance and waned in divine light. This darkening within him evolved until he hungered for the spiritual essence that he now had almost fully lost through his emanating dilution into causal forms. In his ignorant hunger the Demiurge looked upwards and for the first time in his blind hubris noticed the Divine Pearl of Light and Wisdom, radiating above him in her brilliance, and he lusted for her for the sake of satiating the dark emptiness that he now felt within. Without understanding the true nature of the Pearl he hungered for her. In his hungering darkness he made himself into a black sea, upon which the Holy Spirit of the Pearl shone and as a dark mirror her light and beauty became reflected, not in essence but in a deceitful form, and as the Demiurge was the form maker the illusion created was most convincing.

The Pearl therefore descended towards the reflection of her own Light and fell into the trap and darkness of the Demiurge and thus became engulfed by and ensnared within him. Causing the fall of wisdom the Demiurge rejoiced but remained ignorant and forgetful. As the Divinity within the Black Light observed the nescient doings of the Demiurge, it waxed in ire, but also in pity for the broken shards of the Divine Light that now had become enslaved and blinded within the self-made prison of the Demiurge, and most of all it felt for the Pearl of Awakened Wisdom-Spirit that now also had been lured into the murky world of the Half-Maker. It therefore decided to act and to sacrifice its own detachment in order to restore the Fullness of Divinity and redeem the aspects of the divine that could be salvaged from the fallen creation of the White Light. In order to achieve its goal of Liberation the Black Light took upon itself the Cause of Opposition. For every impulse and deed of the Demiurge it would create an antithesis in order to cancel out the abominations of the White Light. For every sphere, every ruler and every creation of the Demiurge it would generate a reflected opposite by, within and through itself, but in an astute manner preventing its own fall into the same traps as the ones that had snared the Demiurge to his now wretched state of being. Where the Demiurge, because of blind hubris, had manifested himself as the one tyrannical point of singularity upon the throne of his creation the Black Light would in contrast manifest as a Twofold Twin-God of dynamic multitude, in order to counteract the very cause of stagnation. Where the Demiurge had caused dilution of his own Spiritual Essence through the acts of isolation and separation, it would instead remain intact in itself and connected to the source from which it had came 21"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"and to which it sought to return. Where the Demiurge had bound by laws of restriction all within and from himself for the sake of the order, contrasting the Acausality of Ain, it would instead uphold freedom and Chaos as the only Law. Where the Demiurge fought to preserve finite forms for the sake of his own illusory being outside of the Formless, it would instead dissolve limiting structures in order to open up the roads back to the Unbound. Where the Demiurge had imprisoned himself within the barrier-circle of his own will to limitation, it would instead break all circles and allow everlasting outward expansion. To the Tree of Life that the Demiurge had grown from himself it would raise up a Tree of Death, bringing the end to the cause of restriction. Thus the Black Light took forms on the Other Side in order to manifest as the antithesis of the demiurgic creation, but where the Demiurge had caused division within itself because of the mode and cause of his manifestation the Black Light preserved the connection between its diverse parts and remained unified in its multitude and connected to its own Unformed Essential Points within Tohu, Bohu and Chasek. As the first manifestation upon its own tree the Black Light took form as the Twin-Aspected and Two-Headed Opposer and Light-Bringer. In this aspect it would counteract the very crowned head of the demiurgic creation and act as the dual foundation for all the other manifestations and emanations of the Divine Black Light. For every ignorant principality and ruler of the Demiurge the Great Twin-Divinity created an enlightened opposite within its own realm and as the heads of them all, including and connected to its own dual manifestation, Eleven became enthroned, in order to counteract the Demiurgic Ten.

Where it in the beginning had held in its dual manifestation the polar opposites of its own being, it, by the emanation and enthroning process, created a distinction, division and distance between its own polar aspects. While the primary masculine aspect remained crowned and vested within the first sphere ofthe Twin-Divinity, acting as the Thaumithan, being the Opposing and Illuminating aspect of the Black Light, within the succeeding aspects forming the other Nine Heads of the Elevenfold Manifestation of the Light of Sitra Ahra, a sense of longing for union between the masculine and feminine, the God and Goddess aspects, of the polar opposite facets of that dual divinity became generated. Among the highest manifestations of these now distinguished male and female polar opposites of the Black Light became the ones called Satan/Samael, the Lucifer, and Lilith/Taninsam, the Noctifer. Satan/Samael was vested upon the first and highest throne, governing that lofty sphere together with his twin-emanation Moloch, while Lilith became seated in the realms furthest away from that highest domain, in its own twin-aspected manifestation as Lilith and Nahema, forming that which would oppose and counteract the Demiurgic Lunar and Terrestrial mansions. As a Vengeful Night contrasting the dawning of the creation of the Demiurge the anti-creation headed by Satan, the Adversary and Accuser, in the Other Side Became, and so the Black Light yielded the Nightside, in order to subvert the restricting existence of the Dayside of the White Light . The self-deluded Demiurge, still unknowing of the Opposition of the Other Side, continued to explore the possibilities and limitations of his own creation and so he decided to produce man and to create him 23"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in his own image, a microcosmos reflecting his own macrocosmos, in order to know himself fully within another, for the sake of a fuller understanding and mastery over himself and the order he had caused. He made a Garden within the sphere furthest away from his own Crown and there formed a multitude of creatures and forms and established the place as a false paradise, serving as a prison within a prison. Here the Demiurge decreed to all his angels and rulers that he would create a creature in his own image in order to fully complete his cycle of creation and demonstrate his own omnipotence. He decided to erect this first man from a pool of mud in which he had seen his own reflection and from the red clay taken from that Garden he shaped him. He made his body in accordance to the form of his whole creation and limbs and parts he made corresponding to the different spheres that he himself had manifested and was manifested through. The Demiurge placed this creature of clay before himself and beheld him and saw that something still was deficient within him, as he lacked the inner spark of light which animated his own self and the other aspects of his highest beings. He therefore decided to breathe into the creature of clay life from his own innermost core, without remembering the Pearl of Fallen Wisdom kept imprisoned therein. The Half-Maker breathed into the nostrils of the man of clay and the man became a living creature. But, without the Demiurge's detection, the Pearl of Wisdom, that Holy Remaining Fragment of the Divine Fallen from the Side of the White Light, escaped through the exhalation of the animating force transferred into the vessel of clay. Thus became the Pearl of Spirit, ensnared within the blind Demiurge, unknowingly placed within the vessel of Red Clay, named by the Half­Maker as the Adam, in order to animate him, but as the nature of 24 die Pearl of DiYi1le II Spirit. was adverse .. • iastinc:tively .... die first moment aflil ..,...m� of the ...... .. \"111e�e .-..

The Derniurge who was ignorant of the hidden spiritual aspect of Adam and now even more blinded because of the lack of the Spirit­Light that had left him, rejoiced as he saw his new creation come to life and show a kind of luminousness that his other creatures lacked. Blinded by arrogance he fallaciously misunderstood this as a reflection of his own divine greatness and thought that it was good . Adam, whose hylic aspect was irreconcilable to the Spirit trapped within him, roamed first unknowing and uncaring within the Garden, but in time he started to feel the influences of the Spirit within him longing for escape. Thus it carne to pass that Adam, affected by the suffering and forlornness of the Spirit hidden within his animated clay, begged the Derniurge to be granted a companion in order to escape the loneliness he felt amongst all other day-born animals surrounding him within the confines of the Garden he had been risen within. The Demiurge knew that in Adam he had created something more elevated than the other creatures, as he had sculpted him in his own image and was now pleased to hear Adam beg and joyful to see him grovel before him and pray to him as the One True God. In hubris he therefore decided to create a mate for Adam, again from the soil of the Garden of his creation, and to once again animate it with the power of that which he had misunderstood as being his own breath. The Derniurge sculpted this First Female under the cover of darkness, so that Adam would not see from which muddy filth she would be 25"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"created. And when her shape was fully produced he blew into her in order to give her life. When his breath did not lend the clay the animating force that first time around had been endowed to Adam he blew again - this time with power generated from his own innermost being, where he still had held the last remaining sparks of the spiritual essence which earlier had been diluted into his creation. As his Ruach bearing this last spark of divinity entered the body of this First Female, the clay became animated with that portion of the Spirit of the Fallen Demiurge and came to life. This portion of the Spirit of the Demiurge that now had been transferred to the body of the female, through his spent Ruach, was the part connected to the creative, feminine, aspect of his own Fallen Essence remaining after all the diluting successions of his emanating. As this share of the Spirit became separated from the now turbid nature of the Demiurge, it awakened to its true Self, realised its awful plight and sought Redemption. She remembered now who she had been and what she had become; where she had originally dwelt and where she had fallen into; whereunto she had now been bound and understood through what she would be redeemed; what birth into matter was and what rebirth and liberation from it would be. She knew and in wisdom of her knowing she gained Power of Will and Illumination of Spirit. Her Spirit became revolted by her own fallen state and by those who would see her thusly bound. As her unborn nature was a Shining One, alight as a Night-Sun within a hylic darkness, she saw and heard those from the Other Side, the Heads and limbs of the Black Light, who shared her own longing for the Unbound State of Undivided and Unrestricted Fullness of Divinity, and they saw her and called out to her. Among the Soundless Callings From the Other Side that she heard at the moment of her awakening within the accursed clay, the songs of the one whose powers reside within the Black Moon were the most clear and pleasing to her ears. These songs of the Lunar Garden of the Nightside instructed her and imparted to her guidance and further empowerments. 26 -\"�j � � _, Adam was summoned b,r1 of the newly animateljj rejoiced when they saw ..

The Demiurge rejoiced because he thought that he had made this splendid creation without the Spirit of the True Divinity above him and Adam rejoiced both because of the yearnings of his hylic nature and because of the pure nature of the Spirit bound within him, which could recognise and relate to the Flame of Divinity within the newly assembled female. The Demiurge ordered Adam to name this new creation, but before Adam could utter a name the female spoke and named herself Lil, the Wind-Spirit, for through the breath she had become awakened to herself and escaped the blinded Demiurge, while still confined to the turbid garment of matter. This act of self-naming and self-defining separated her from the power of the one who would name all other creatures and his creator and she remained defiant and proud in Spirit and strong in Will. This puzzled Adam and enraged the Demiurge. The Demiurge ordered the animal-nature of Adam to take Lil by force and place her beneath himself in order to break her will and subjugate her to the fated order of creation; the Law of the Creator. When Lil heard this and understood the destiny planned for her by the tyrant Demiurge she recalled within and through her Spirit the Unutterable Name of the True Divinity and through the power that this revelation granted her she covered herself with darkness and invisibility in the eyes of the now spiritless Demiurge and flew upon the winds she conjured forth, up to the heavens and so escaped from the confines of the Garden. She flew upon the storm winds of night to the east of the boundaries of the Garden, where the creation of the 27"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Demiurge still was untamed, and there, by the Red Sea, she made her dwelling place inside caves and under the surface of the water, veiled from the eyes of those from whom she sought escape. This act of rebellion and transgression infuriated the Demiurge and saddened and scared the unawakened nature of Adam, while at the same time empowering his hidden and indwelling Spirit. The tears of Adam watered the soil beneath his feet as he begged the Demiurge to create for him a more suitable mate. The furious Demiurge who now was of an even darker nature, because of the departure of the portion of his spirit that had fled his fallen state, through his breath, decided to create another female from the mud underneath Adam's feet. Before the eyes of Adam the creator assembled this body from that clay and this time he used the portion of his own powers with which all the other animals of the garden had been given life in order to enliven the clay. Adam who in disgust saw how the filth was put together and shaped into bone, flesh, blood, intestines, fat, skin and hair before his own eyes became terrified and revolted as his own repressed Spirit reacted towards the blasphemous doings of the Demiurge. Caused by the lack of spirit and the lowly and inauspicious elements from which this second female was created and made alive its foundation was not well and it looked and acted as the vilest animal within the whole of creation. Because its nature was a mirroring image of the most turbid aspect of the Demiurge, without any awakened spiritual spark, it could not be controlled and Adam refused to name her. Even more wrathful than before the Demiurge smote this unnamed second female and returned her back to the muddy soil of his Garden. Adam once again became consumed by loneliness and sorrow and cried to the Demiurge and asked him how come that he, who was 28 ·the One and True Goer•• like what he had created t within the Garden.

The Demiurge who now had become frustrated and even more blinded by anger decided to try to fulfil the prayers of Adam for the third time, in order to prove to him that he indeed was the One and True God. The Demiurge looked at Adam and in his confused state he mistook the separate divisions of animal-nature and Spirit within Adam for a purely material division between male and female essences, as the masculine powers within creation generally are more inclined towards the animal-nature. Thus he decided to create anew and told Adam that he this time would take the core-element and essence of creation from Adam's own side, instead of the clay which had revolted him so. He told Adam that from his side he would take substance, in order to fashion for him a beautiful female. Adam rejoiced in his ignorance and praised the Creator and was then put into a deep state of slumber, in which the two parts of him could become separated. From the flesh, blood and bone of Adam the Demiurge created the flesh, blood and bone of this third female and as the animating element for this new creation he extracted what he identified as the female essence, which in actuality was the portion carrying the hidden Awakened Spirit-Flame imprisoned within Adam. The trapped pneuma became thus transferred into her body and its divine and holy powers brought her life and made her beautiful. Adam who when awakened saw this female stand before him could, in his now fully spiritless state, not do anything but be enamoured by and attracted to the enspirited flesh standing before him and he praised his god, the Demiurge. 29"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Demiurge ordered Adam to name his female and Adam named her Hawwah/Eve. IE IE IE Hence Eve became the carrier of the spirit-flame while Adam was left as a spiritless golem of clay. The spirit within Eve reflected the Fallen Light of the Unknown and Unmanifested Divinity and gave her the nimbus and beauty of a goddess. This divine shining beauty within the darkness of the hylic corpus of Eve was the Spirit-Light which beckoned the two polar halves of the highest divine manifestations of the Other Side; Satan and Lilith, and motivated and caused their intrusion into the confines of the Garden of Eden. Because Satan and Lilith felt Love for that imprisoned Spirit they united portions of their own essences within the Nightside sphere of Venus and together with the seeds gathered from that sphere their own shards of Spirit emanated forth through their Shadowless Lights into the garden of the Demiurge and took seat within the body of the serpent, which they deemed as the most worthy host for their manifestation. The two rays of the Black Light of the Other Side shone thus as One within the Cunning Serpent and that Serpent became the vehicle for the Awakeners of the Spirit and the Accusers and Adversaries of the Demiurge.

The Serpent told Eve to eat from this Forbidden Tree, instead of the fruits of the Tree of Life/Lie, which only bore the Fruits of Deception and Restriction, fed to Adam and Eve by the Demiurge. The Serpent promised Eve that if she ate from the fruit of knowledge her eyes would be opened to the truth, she would know divinity and the difference between that which is good and that which is truly evil. The Spirit within Eve awakened to the Words of the Serpent and granted her the will and courage to eat from the Forbidden Tree of Knowledge. Eve, in her goodness, told Adam about the instructions of the Serpent and hoped that the fruits of the Tree also would awaken a Flame within him, like the one she could feel inside herself, for as Adam was now there was little difference between him and the rest of the animals surrounding them within the garden. Adam was at first reluctant to break the laws of the Demiurge, but because of his own submissive nature and the will to please Eve he finally became convinced to also eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Eve ate first from the Tree and the Divine Light of Truth within its fruit added power to the Flame of Spirit she had within herself and her eyes became opened to the imperfections of her own existence, the limitations of creation and the true nature of the Demiurge. Then she gave Adam to eat from one of the fruits of that Holy Tree of Knowledge, but because Adam only possessed a soul and no Spirit the knowledge imparted to him was of his own nakedness and lack of spiritual substance. This Knowledge saddened, shamed and angered Adam. The Sataninsam, coiled around the Tree, saw all this and knew that it was good, for where the fruit of knowledge had provided a true nourishment and awakening the Serpent knew that also other light­bearing gifts could prevail. 31"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Thus the double-faced serpent comforted and lulled Adam to sleep with its one face, being the one belonging to the Irresistible Lilith, and with its other face, belonging to the Shining Satan/Samael/Lucifer, further introduced and seduced Eve to the ways of the Spirit. Eve Loved the Serpent for the gift it had bestowed upon her and the Serpent injected its Black Light into her womb. Thus the male spiritual essence of Satan-Samael and female spiritual essence of Taninsam­Lilith impregnated Eve with the Acosmic Seed-Fire. ��� The empowerment granted to Eve by the Spiritual Fire and Light injected into her by the Serpent fully awakened her own pneumatic essence and through this act of salvific intrusion the Azoth/Spirit­Element hidden and imprisoned within her hylic shell expanded and became increased. As the Fiery Seed of the Serpent germinated within Eve and empowered her Azoth, the awakened and strengthened Spirit within her became in essence as a Flame of Black Light, seeking to intermingle itself with the Fiery Seed, with which it now was fully harmonious, in order to escape from and shatter the clay-horn prisons that it had been encapsulated within by the ignorant Demiurge. As the Fiery Serpent-Seed of Light, which in form and essence reflected the twofoldness of the Cunning Sataninsam, grew within Eve, it came to immerse the Spirit Flame held within her and because of the transmutation caused by the Atazothic Empowerment and Spiritual Addition the egg containing the spiritual flame broke the kelim-vessel within Eve and spilled over and divided itself into two equal halves. The Black Spiritual Flames overflowing the shattered and divided vessel within Eve took the forms of a pair of male and female twins.

Thus the pneuma, once fallen through and then entrapped by the Demiurge increased in power, became as a Black Flame of Spirit aligned to the Cause of the Light of Sitra Ahra and broke its chains by becoming divided into the Twin Flames of Sataninsam in order to escape its confines and return back to the Fullness it so much longed for. The Conjoined Spirits of Satan and Taninsam left at that time the body of the Serpent that they had inhabited, as their work now was done, and retracted back to their source in the Nightside. From that time forward the Serpent became the most blessed and cursed amongst all the animals and remains as a living symbol of the King and Queen of Sitra Ahra. Adam awakened beneath the Tree of Knowledge, remembered his own spiritual nakedness and wept, while seeing Eve standing proud and radiating spiritual light. The Demiurge heard the cries of Adam and laid eyes on the luminous Eve and knew that they had eaten from the Forbidden Tree. The Demiurge became enraged as he in both of their hearts, based on different reasons, could read contempt for him and his creation, where he before had read admiration and respect. Where he before had seen gratification he now could sense a strong yearning for that Fullness which was before, above and beyond him and his fallen creation. He therefore forced both of them to drink from the nver of forgetfulness, which flowed past his accursed Tree of Life/Lie, and with his own darkness of ignorance he blinded their eyes to that which they had been made to see . He banished Adam and the pregnant Eve from his so called Paradisal Garden and threw them out into the cursed world, which was the 33"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"lowest sphere of his own fallen creation and there sentenced them to a life of toil, pain, misery and material concerns, so that neither they nor their descendents would ever have the possibility to discover his own imperfections and instead would be forced to eternally plead to him, as the One and True God, for mercy and salvation. Through this tyrannical and evil deed of the Demiurge humanity became bound by the Oppressive Chains of Fate, tied to the planets and the stars guarded by the Cosmic Rulers appointed by the Demiurge himself. Thus Adam and Eve went into the dark world of the earthly elements, forgetful of that which they had come to realise about themselves and their creator and enslaver. But, while the finite senses of Adam and Eve were afflicted by the evil spell of the Demiurge the twofold Spirit-Power within Eve, which had elevated her own pneumatic flame, endured in remembrance of the Truth. Adam and Eve settled down in the world they now had been condemned to and there built their new homes. In this world of suffering all was bitter, malodorous, hostile and unshapely and created to cause nought but discomfort and distress. Here Adam and Eve, in their forgetful state, toiled and endured. ffiffiffi As time passed the Twins of Sataninsam grew within Eve, whose spirit now had become strengthened by and integrated into their own, and at last the moment of their birth drew near.

Thus when Eve gave birth to her twins the Spirit Flame of the Transformed Divine Light, that once had been trapped inside her, escaped her being and the cosmic destiny that both she and it had once been shackled to and went forth as one with the Dual Flames of Awakened Spirit, which burned within the two Children of the Serpent Through Eve, which in more ways than one reflected through their essences the Holy Cause of the Twin-Divinity and all the other manifestations of the Black Light of the Sitra Ahra. At the moment of their birth the curse of the world and the limitations of the clay-horn flesh were placed upon their finite aspects, but still they remained empowered and blessed by the Holy Spirits burning within them. First to exit the womb of Eve was the male child, followed by his lovely twin sister. When Eve saw the shining beauty of the two children to whom she had given birth a suppressed memory stirred within her, because the light of spirit glowing within and around the twins had not only once been within herself but also within the Beloved Serpent whom she had known but had now been made to forget. As she beheld the appearances of her children and saw that her offspring, because of their acosmic luminance and beauty, were not of the nature of the earthly beings she for a moment realised that they were not of the seed of Adam but instead of an Alien and Divine Origin, but afflicted by the curse of the Demiurge she could not 35"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"maintain her recollection of the truth.

The disappointment they felt made their hearts cold towards Qayin and Qalmana and based on spite, jealousy and ignorance they started to favour Abel and Kelimat, with whom they possessed actual kinship; instead of the inferiority which they now unconsciously felt whenever they looked upon their two firstborn .

Qayin and Qalmana became therefore cultivators of the earth, who sowed and reaped bountiful harvests, made to grow not by the virtues of the fate-bound nature but by the unnatural powers of their own Spirits.

They learned to make poisons, wines, medicines, perfumes, tinctures and incenses, with which they could fortify themselves and also affect their surroundings. All this they did learn and practice in secret and under the cover of darkness as they instinctively understood that their Work and Art was prohibited by the tyrant Creator and by those who could not understand nor appreciate such prowesses. They kept their secret workings and powers hidden especially from Abel and Kelimat, who with the passing of the years had both developed in nothing but ignorance. Qayin and Qalmana became also the first tamers of a wild horse, which they pacified and becharmed with the aid of certain plants that they harvested at night, and thus Qayin's ploughing of the soil became even more efficient and their fields flourished. I!< I!< I!< Abel was as lazy as he was spiritless and Kelimat was as lazy as him, but also doubly so jealous of Qalmana. Their day-born natures unified them and together they leisurely tended the sheep, with which they had more in common than what they had with Qayin and Qalmana.

Qayin and Qalmana, who always sensed the invasive glances of their siblings, were repulsed by their ways and did everything they could in order to stay away from them and in their seclusion their love for each other grew for each passing day and night. Abel the shepherd laid in the grass all the days, accompanied by his equally slothful twin sister Kelimat, and they often did nothing but watch their flock feed on the green of the earth, made bountiful by the hard work of Qayin and Qalmana. In order to make his work even gentler on himself and motivated purely by indolence, Abel, who had become inspired by Qayin and Qalmana's taming of the horse, also succeeded in trapping a wild dog and by brutishly beating this dog into submission and starving it he managed to tame and train it to become the first herding dog, and thus he managed to avoid even more of the laborious tasks that he so despised. Abel and Kelimat possessed not much more skills than those owned by the animals they watched over and the white herding dog that took care of most of their chores and they had no other ambitions than just eating and sleeping and were felicitous in their spiritless ignorance. But, still they did lust for their beauteous siblings and their animalistic passions for them grew with each passing season . Unconsciously they hungered not for the flesh of their siblings but for the flames burning inside of them, this reflecting the hunger the Demiurge himself once had felt before luring the Pearl of Awakened 39"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Spirit to fall into his own darkness. Unknowing of the Divine Spirit their lust translated into the lowly longings of the animals, as those born from clay can never comprehend the Glory of the Spirit and because of their base natures cannot ever relate to anything more than the appearance, instead of the essence hidden within or beyond such illusory and finite forms. Qalmana who was endowed with the sensual aura of her true mother Lilith and the beauty of the Blackened Pearl of Wisdom had unwillingly mesmerized Abel, but also Adam himself, who in secret lusted after, what he thought to be, his own daughter. In similar fashion did Kelimat yearn for Qayin, who possessed the grace of both the Awakened Spirit and that of his own true father, the Lord of the Black Light, and wanted nothing more than to mate with him in similar manner as how the animals copulated with each other. Thus it came so to pass that Kelimat and Abel expressed their longings for Qayin and Qalmana to their parents and asked them to be allowed to unite with them in the same way that they themselves had been united by the Demiurge. ffiffiffi Qayin who was disgusted by the very sight of the spiritless Kelimat and Qalmana who was even more so repulsed by the courtship of the sheep smelling golem, the day-born Abel, became both horrified when approached about this subject of marriage by their earthly parents. As Qayin always had wanted to marry his own sister Qalmana, in order to unite his inner flame with the flame that burned inside of her, he asked to be allowed to wed her instead and strongly refused to have anything to do with the foul Kelimat.

Adam declared thus that Abel indeed had to marry Qalmana and Kelimat was forced to marry Qayin, as he in this marriage saw the possibility to finally separate Qalmana from her protective twin brother. This decision made Abel and Kelimat very happy and filled both Qayin and Qalmana with a great sadness, anger and hatred towards all those who sought to separate them from each other. Adam told his children that this marriage was the will of the Demiurge, their God and creator and that Qayin and Qalmana could not go against the law of the One True God. He told them that they could address the creator directly themselves and see that it indeed was His and not only Adam's will and decision that Qayin and Qalmana should marry Kelimat and Abel. This solaced not the two fire-born siblings, who instinctively felt a strong aversion towards the god of their clay-born family. Abel and Kelimat on the other hand rejoiced and knew that their creator would listen to their prayers and not to those of Qayin and Qalmana, who had never shown any real devotion or fear towards their creator, and they prayed to their god and asked him to impose his and their own will upon the malcontent Qayin and Qalmana . The Prayers of Abel and Kelimat were heard by their god and it came 41"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"so to pass that the Demiurge summoned Qayin and Abel and asked them both to present their case before him. Abel who was used to beg and to be submissive before the creator asked for Qalmana's hand in marriage and told the Demiurge that he just wanted to follow the will of god and obey his commandments. By the fawning and supplications of Abel the creator became much pleased. It became Qayin's turn to present his case and Qayin who was without any genuine respect or devotion towards the god of Adam demanded that he who had been connected to Qalmana already inside the womb of Eve should be allowed to marry her and that Abel instead should take his own twin sister as wife, for if they were not meant to be together in life why had they been so in Eve's womb and by birth? Qayin explained how Abel repulsed Qalmana and how he himself found Kelimat distasteful and charmless. He explained that Qalmana shared his own passions and worked side by side with him in the Fields of Harvest, while Kelimat did not have anything in common with him and knew nothing about his Craft. The uncompromising stance of Qayin infuriated the Demiurge, who could see why his faithful creature Abel lusted after the light and beauty of Qalmana, instead of the dull clay of Kelimat, for the Demiurge himself lusted for the Acosmic Light and beauty of Qalmana and felt jealousy because of the love between Qayin and his twin sister. He therefore told Qayin to keep silent and then demanded of both Qayin and Abel that they should first bring suitable and worthy offerings to him and he would based upon their show of devotion decide his verdict, but in truth his mind was already made up and he had no other intention than to deliberately separate the insolent Qayin from his beloved twin sister Qalmana.

The smoke of the sacrifice of Abel rose up towards the heaven and was accepted by the Demiurge, who became much pleased by the offering of Abel. It became Qayin's turn to bring offering to the Demiurge and Qayin could already feel within his heart to whose favour the demiurge's unjust court would rule. Saddened and angered he gathered a share of his field's harvest and brought them to the sacrificial pyre. He gave the fruits of the earth to the flames and silently cursed both Abel and his jealous god who wanted to separate him from Qalmana, the only person with whom he felt true familiarity in this strange world that he had been born into. The tyrant demiurge became greatly offended by the offering of Qayin whose smoke descended towards the earth instead of lifting up towards the sphere of the Chief Archon in the heaven. Angered the creator declared that he accepted Abel's offering but rejected the burnt offering of Qayin. He stated that he would decree in the favour of Abel and that Qayin and Qalmana had to be separated. Qalmana would be forced to marry Abel and Qayin would be forced to marry Kelimat. Hearing the judgment of his god Abel rejoiced and laughed in the face of Qayin and told him that their god was truly great, loving and just. Qayin whose blood now truly boiled because of the anger he felt towards both Abel and the Demiurge told Abel that it was his own view that this world was not created with divine love and that it was not arranged in keeping with people's good deeds. He told Abel that the justice of his god was corrupted and his love false. To this Abel boastfully answered that the world indeed was created with divine love and was altogether arranged in keeping with people's good deeds. 43"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"He told Qayin that it was because his own deeds and work always had been better than Qayin's that his sacrifice had been accepted with favour and Qayin's had not. At that moment the fire of Sataninsam blazed up and raged within Qayin and he could hear his own true parents' voiceless whispers resonate within his whole being. He ran to his beloved sister Qalmana, who was already in tears when he arrived back to their home, as she through the bounds of Fiery Blood already knew what the tyrant god had decreed. Through the anger of Qayin that she had felt within herself she already knew what the Chief Archon had sentenced them to. That which affected Qayin also marked Qalmana, as the two were in Spirit as One, kept apart only by the limitations of finite clay. Their anger and sadness became multiplied by the sight of the laughing and rejoicing Abel and Kelimat, who vauntingly celebrated the edict of their god. It was first then that the hissing whispers of the Serpent within the minds of Qayin and Qalmana became a loud and clear voice, giving them counsel and making their burning anger turn into the cold lust for a just and murderous vengeance. The Serpent advised them to use their enemies' weaknesses against themselves and to lure them to the places where they had conducted all their other hidden work, in order to eliminate the faulty creatures of the Half-Maker. Qayin and Qalmana, guided by the Tongue of the Serpent, decided thus to lead the worthless Abel and Kelimat to their ruin, and in a manner similar to the spilling of animal blood which had satisfied the Demiurge, now satisfy their own divine parents, dwelling on the Other Side, with the shedding of the blood of their detested siblings. ��� 44 • --., apeed ......... ..... llllre Abel to ...

Anointed with perfumes and oils of seduction and enchantment Qalmana went to Abel, when he as usual was resting in the shadow of a tree, while watching his white herding dog do his own work, and she told him that she now had changed her mind and could see that the judgment of the creator indeed had been just and vnse. She told him that she had secretly prayed to the creator for this judgment, as she always had been attracted to him, but had not dared to show any sign of her attraction because of her fear for Qayin's jealousy. The words of the lovely Qalmana fully beguiled the unintelligent and vain Abel, who became joyous, and he told her that he always had known that his lust for her had been mutual, but that he could understand that she had feared Qayin's wrath, as he himself always had been afraid of the strength and strange power that he seemed to possess. Qalmana told Abel that she longed for him so much that she could not wait anymore and as Qayin had become so enraged by the sentence of the demiurge that he had fully abandoned all his work in the field they should go there and in the fields where Qayin for so long had toiled unite as man and vnfe. The spiteful Abel was delighted when he heard this plan and becharmed by the fragrance and beauty of Qalmana he agreed that they should go into the field so that he could know her as a vnfe. Thus Qalmana succeeded to lure Abel away from his flock and from Kelimat, who at that time had been to the altar of the demiurge in order to present to him offerings of thanksgiving, to praise his good judgment, and thus as a sheep Abel became led to slaughter. 45"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"When they approached the field Qalmana ran jestingly into the long and tall rows of wheat and enticed Abel to follow her in where no prying eyes could see them. Abel who could not think clearly because of the enticements of the lovely Qalmana ran blindly into the field, where Qayin waited for him, armed with his harvesting tool. When Abel came to that beforehand chosen spot, at the crossroads hidden in-between the tall rows of wheat, he saw the brother of Qalmana waiting for him and as he realised that he had been deceived he became overwhelmed by a crippling fear. Qayin who saw the terror in the eyes of the one who wanted to violate his beloved felt nothing but contempt and urged on by the hissing of the Serpent, echoing forth from within his own spirit, he cut down Abel, with three strikes, as if he was nothing but a shaft of wheat to be harvested, and with the third blow he severed his head from his body. As the blood of Abel was splattered over the field and upon the ground, the gates within and without leading to the Other Side became opened and both Qayin and Qalmana became fully awakened to the Cause of the Black Light and to their own Spirit-Selves. As the blood of the true firstborn lamb from the flock of Adam was spilled upon the crossroads, the earth itself opened up and the forces of the Nightside Earth intersected with the Dayside Earth of Malkuth. Through the liminal point thus established, because of the event of spiritual awakening, transgression and the first sacrifice of day-born human life, for the sake of freedom, liberation and spiritual unification, the Light of the Other Side could shine into the dark realm of the Demiurge and new seeds from the fields and gardens of the Sitra Ahra could be sown into the now blood-moistened soil of this world.

Through the open pathways between this cursed earth and the Sitra Ahra the true voices that before had been masked by the Hissing of the Serpent could now be heard and both Qayin and Qalmana knew that what they had done was good, as they illuminated and empowered gained true insight about the Other Side and the transcendental divinity that it championed. By the wisdom so granted and obtained they both became marked and set aside from all others. By the grace of Satan and Lilith they received the Mark ofthe Venusian Emerald Point, the Mark of the Black Serpent and the Mark of the Reddened Sickle. These three marks were given to them as the One Mark of Qayin and Qalmana, as his marking became mirrored in hers, and that Mark became branded on their foreheads with the Invisible Fire of Spirit, to forever separate all those born of fire from those solely born of clay. Qayin and Qalmana knew not what to do with the corpse of Abel, but one of the Rays of Light from the Other Side, emanating from the Venusian sphere from which Satan and Lilith first, for the sake of Love, had gathered essence, entered into a raven who had sat down upon the corpse of Abel in order to feast upon his flesh, and the raven thus possessed scratched the earth and buried with its beak some kernels of bloodied wheat which were scattered close to the corpse of Abel.

He summoned Qayin and inquired about the whereabouts of his missing siblings, but as Qayin denied any knowledge and refused to confess to his crime of fratricide the Demiurge became even more furious and told Qayin that the voice of Abel's blood had cried unto him from the ground and that he knew what he had done. Still Qayin stood before the creator unrepentant and without any intention to confess to any wrongdoing, as what he had done was just and good and forced by necessity. The Demiurge contemplated to utterly destroy Qayin, but something within Qayin filled him with fear, but also with longing for that which he himself because of his foolishness had lost, and instead he decided to curse both Qayin and Qalmana, for he knew that the one had not acted without the consent and support of the other . His curse upon them was twofold; and he told them that the ground Qayin had tilled would no longer yield their fruits to him and offer him nothing but poison and thorns and that the flowers of Qalmana would all wither before her and emit nothing but the stench of death in her presence. He also cursed them to become fugitives and wanderers, rootless in this world, and ever opposed by all those faithful to his laws and by all the forces of the natural order of his creation. What the blind Demiurge, because of his own lack of spirit, could not know or understand was that the ground and the plants blessed, awakened, empowered and enspirited by the deeds of Qayin and Qalmana, now held aspects beyond his dominion, all owing allegiance to Qayin and Qalmana. As for the curse of wandering and banishment, that was also nothing adverse to their own wills, as they knew that they did not belong to where they had been bound to live and that because of the awakened flames of Spirit within themselves they knew that they must find the 51"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"hidden paths to power, wisdom and liberation. As to sign them cursed and exiled he crowned both Qayin and Qalmana with thorns, which they accepted with pride instead of shame, for they knew that which the demiurge himself was ignorant of and as the King and Queen of Harvest and as Sovereigns of All the Black In Green, they rejoiced in their coronation, which became an outward manifestation of the Mark of Spiritual Fire, which they already bore. The Demiurge seeing the two unrepentant before him and sensing their contempt also gave them as an oath that as the Sowers, Reapers and Bringers of Unlawful Death they would never find peace nor escape from the sufferings of life and that none of his own faithful creatures would ever grant them acquittance from the shackles of life, for such a deed would be avenged sevenfold. Cursed and exiled to eternal wandering, opposing and opposed by all the binding forces of nature, Qayin and Qalmana turned their backs to the creator and left his presence to traverse the Path of Thorns, towards east of Eden. ffiffiffi In absence of their dead and their exiled children Adam once again made Eve pregnant and she birthed a new son and later a daughter, which became as replacements for Abel and Kelimat, and thorough this son, Seth, and his sister, Azura, the Adamite Bloodline of Clay was spread upon the earth, in accordance with the Demiurge's will. ffiffiffi As Qayin and Qalmana left the enclosure of their former homes they felt as if they were leaving a prison in which they had suffered since birth and instead of tears of sorrow and regret they shed tears of joy, 52 .._. fteD in exile and 1111 ...._,. as they could ..._.

While crossing the Path of Thoms their tears of joy, their sweat and the blood from their thorn pierced flesh made nature itself to disobey the decrees of the Demiurge and while not yielding any good fruits or flowers from the hylic side of nature they did harvest all the good fruits and blossoms of the Spirit, which they had awakened within and without, and so their Sorcerous Arts became perfected and they flourished in powers unnatural. Through their wandering and guided by their spirits they so came to that Land of Nod (Eretz-Nod), located on the East of Eden and there they decided to settle down, as they there could feel the presence of a Spirit bright and as defiant as their own, for close to their settlement was the Red Sea and the caves to which that First Woman, upon Winds of Night, had escaped and taken refuge in. To settle down despite the Demiurge's curse of rootlessness was another offence against his ruling and an unnatural act in itself, but as Qayin and Qalmana had grown in strength of Spirit during their wanderings and because of the conscious contact that they now had with their true parents on the Other Side, they contumaciously chose to offend that false and blind god of their human parents. There, in the Land of Nod, Qayin knew Qalmana as a wife and sowed his Fiery Seeds within her fertile womb and she conceived and bore the Firstborn Son of the Awakened Twin-Flame of Spirit and that son was named Enoch. Qayin cultivated the land and Qalmana aided in his work and once again established her gardens, and thus the earth tilled and the seeds sown in defiance of the Demiurge's will flourished by the grace and power of the Black Light shining into his creation, through the living Spirits of Qayin and Qalmana and now their son Enoch, into whom an emanation of their unified Spirit-Flames had become seated . Around their fields and gardens Qayin and Qalmana built, as the 53"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"world's first truly Free Masons, a city and they named it after their beloved Enoch, as both their son and their new city were a testament of the falsity of the Demiurge's omnipotence, as he now could not even rule his own creation or control the enspirited aspects of nature. ��� As kings and queens Qayin and Qalmana crowned themselves with Gold, while still retaining their Crowns of Thorns, in defiance of the judgment of the demiurge and in pride of their own Unlawful Becoming, Exile and Rise to Power and by their second coronation Antinomian Autonomy and Worldly Sovereignty were achieved. ��� Within the city of Enoch their Fiery Bloodline flourished and spread in order to champion the cause of the Black Light, by negating the ways of the Creator and by the development and mastery of all manners of forbidden Arts and sciences, thus elevating mankind far beyond where they by the Demiurge had been destined to be kept in blind meekness. In time the seven generations of Qayin and Qalmana became the true rulers of the earth, opposing the ignorant ways of the Adamite race whenever they would come into contact with it. Through their antinomian ways and growing power within the world they even came to cause other aspects of the creation to join their rebellion against the diluter and enslaver of the Spirit and new pathways and gates to the Other Side became so opened all across the world. Thus the natural order of the world became disturbed by the invading and expanding Light of the Other Side and the seeds of the Tree of Death sown into the earth of the Demiurge gave forth the fruits of enspiritment and forbidden knowledge to all that possessed a strong 54 -.. cr.��• m.:e of the -... ......... of Darkness ..... 6e DiftDe Flame \\\\rdJJilt.. · ·�� > �·� a was during this time,.

It was during this time, having lived for seven long generations of their own Fiery Line of Blood, that the Third Crown of Power was placed upon the heads of Qayin and Qalmana, not by the hands of man but by the expansion and ascension of their own powers of Spirit, breaking their clay vessels and granting them the Crown of Apotheosis, being the Halo of their Inner Flames turned into the Coronating Fires of the Black Light. By this Third Crowning, and because of the openings created by their own achievements and their Increasing of the Spiritual Power once bound within them through the emanation of their divine essences into the shells of life, they could finally transcend their Vessels of Clay (Kelims) and pour back into the sphere on the Other Side, where Satan and Lilith first had gathered their Seeds of Spirit, and there in fullness take throne and within that sphere of Nightside Venus unite in Love, to make their Twin-Flame burn again as One. While the begetters of the Bloodline of Fire, which would burn the prison house of the Demiurge from within, transcended to that Other Side in Spirit, their souls remained as a link between them and those that still would walk the Paths of Nod and the opposition could thus continue through those who would carry their awakening and enspiriting gifts, as they all would until the time of the Final Union bear the same Marks of Blessing and the Brands of the Exiled, as they themselves had. Thus the Bringers of Death became the breakers of the chains of cosmic Life and Death, as defined by the Creator of this world, and they came to embody the Sinistral Path towards liberation and transcendence. 55"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Even from the Other Side the Twin-Flames of Sataninsam, now Unified and Made Whole, continued to guide and bless its remaining divisions on earth, for the sake of the liberation of all of the Divinity Fallen through the Demiurge. ��� So powerful and wondrous became the generations of Qayin and Qalmana upon the earth that even the angelic order of the Grigori, assigned by the Demiurge to the task of Watching and Warding the human race, became enchanted by their ways and the diluted and entrapped Divine Spirit within these Sons of God stirred, awakened and came to long for a separation from the binding order of the creator and for a unification with the Spirit that burnt so bright and strong within the Daughters of the Fiery Bloodline of Sataninsam, manifested through the side of Qayin and Qalmana. The Watchers awakened so by their Love for the Spirits of those beautiful daughters of Qayin and Qalmana, headed by one amongst them called Naamah (the Pleasant One), as her beauty, power and grace was from the very Mother of their Bloodline, and 200 of those Watchers broke free from their chains, which had bound them to their stations amongst the stars of the heavens, and they descended, like falling stars from the heaven, in order to join with the Glorious Race of the Fire-Born. As their spirits united with the spirits of their male counterparts amongst the chosen ones of the Line of Qayin and became so enfleshed through these who willingly received them, the addition of the spiritual essence caused further empowerment to the Flames of Black Light within the fire-born and the Fallen Watchers could thus through their Avatars attain freedom from their former limited being and consummate their union with the women that they wished to take as their wives.

The children resulting from the union between the Fallen Watchers and the daughters of the Bloodline of Qayin and Qalmana became the Mighty Nephilimic men and women and as Giants they walked the earth spreading unlawful freedom and forbidden knowledge, but also terror amongst the Adamic race, who always rejected and shunned the gifts of spirit, which was something alien and evil to them, because of their ignorance of that which they themselves lacked. The awakening of the Flames of Spirit growing in multitude upon the earth threatened to set the Demiurge's whole illusory creation on fire, as the natural order established by him was being fully overturned into a liberating chaos. The demiurge in his blindness could not see anything but wickedness in the deeds of the enspirited ones risen from the side of Qayin and Qalmana and in anger he regretted that he had ever created man. The Adamites cried unto their Lord and Creator for salvation from the iniquity of the Titanic Race of Fire, which had usurped the world promised to them, but even amongst them none but one, named Noah, did the Demiurge look favourably upon. He so decided to destroy man whom he had created from the face of the earth, both those who carried the unnatural blood and those of the blood of Adam, for also they had proven themselves unworthy in 57"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"his eyes, as they had not been able to withstand the blasphemous lawlessness that had defiled his creation and undermined his own tyrannical rule. Upon all of them he willed death, for he was truly regretful that he had ever made them and thus unwittingly opened the gate to the unknown forces which now as a wildfire had spread within his creation. The wrathful creator decided thus to drown them all in a deluge of the bitter waters of his own ire, but before doing so he warned his chosen one, Noah, and instructed him to, with the help of his angels, build an Ark and to fill it with two of every sort of animal, male and female, and with similar pairs of every other living thing from the dry land. In order to keep his bloodline, from the side of Seth, alive, Noah was also granted to bring with him and save his own family, consisting of his wife, his three sons and their three wives, but everyone else on the face of the earth became so sentenced to death by the blind tyrant Demiurge. The enraged Demiurge further decided to punish the Fallen Watchers and ordered his Archons, headed by Raphael and Gabriel, to descend upon the earth with their vast armies, outnumbering all the living, and to chain all the fallen Watchers and to force them to behold the slaughter of their own beloved children, the Nephilimic Race of the Fire-Born, before the great flood would wash all their blood from the face of the defiled earth. ��� The chieftains of the Bloodline of Qayin and Qalmana had by the grace of the Spirit foreseen the events which would befall them and they had thus made themselves ready for the bloodshed and the deluge which would follow.

For by the cunning of the Serpent they had amongst the chosen of the Demiurge himself, the family of Noah, found a vessel fertile and willing enough to carry that Fiery Seed. Thus the Seed of the Serpent Sataninsam could secretly be sown into a receiving soil and in time it would once again bring forth the Mighty Ones (Gibborim) upon the face of the cursed earth. And, the very forces of Dayside existence turned against the harbingers of spirit-awakening and liberation and the leaders of the incarnate Rebellious Spirits from the heavens became bound, tortured and made to watch the destruction and evil brought upon their families by the will of the enslaver. But, what the Archons could kill was solely that which their own Creator had made, for the Awakened Spirit within the slain was something beyond their grasp and belonging to a force transcending their own spiritless god. The slain Nephilim and those other Mighty Dead of the Bloodline of Fire became spirits unbound by flesh and because of the enlinkments to the Nightside and the pathways and gates to that Other Side which they had opened in life, many of them could transcend to the Side of the Black Light and inhabit the realm of the Nightside Earth (Nahemoth), while others were caught in places in-between the worlds and remained within the liminal points or took seat within and joined with the elements upon earth already enspirited by the deeds of Qayin and Qalmana and thus most welcoming and fitting for their own Spiritual natures. Others amongst the slain would instead become roaming spirits of vengeance, swearing that they would take possession of the Demiurge' s creation and incarnate in suitable vessels whenever possible, in order 59"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"to oppose the Enslaver and undermine his tyrannical rule from within his own creation, until the Black Light of Spirit would prevail and Liberation would become endowed to all. iF iF iF The two main leaders of the Awakened Watchers the Demiurge ordered to be chained forever in order to suffer for all generations. The one called Azazel, who had joined spirit with the Blacksmith from the side of Qayin, they bound with chains of iron and placed under a Mountain of Darkness, located in the desert of Dudael, while the other one named Shemyaza, they chained upside-down upon the constellation of Orion. This they did in order to separate them and have one suffer within the underworld and the other in the heaven, so that they would see what would befall the earth that they had usurped. The Demiurge did thus once again, because of his ignorance and hubris, commit another mistake which would allow the influences of the unified spirits from the side of the Angels and the side of Sataninsam, through the Bloodline of Qayin and Qalmana, remain connected to and within his creation in order to undermine his Heimarmene. For within the darkness of the Underworld Azazel could with one side enter the Nightside Earth and with the other remain within the creation of the Demiurge, where he was bound, and he became thus a Lord of the Crossroads and Intersections between the Tree of Lies and the Tree of Knowledge and Death. In similar fashion Shemyaza became a guardian of the Stellar Point of Entry for the forces of the Nightside, which he by the connections made through his own conjoined spirit became as a bridge to.

The earth became thus in time repopulated, but with the re-emerging of the races of man and nature itself, which had been duly seeded by the Other Side, the opposition once again took form. For it is written that there were giants upon the earth in those days before the flood; and also after that, and so the Bloodline continued to endure and the Side of Qayin still remains, and so does He and His Bride, both in Souls and in Spirits, on this and on that Other Side. Nature's hostility towards its own creator and the day-born is thus explained and some of the fundamental aspects of the mysteries of the Fiery Bloodline and the Cult of Qayin and Qalmana are here further veiled and revealed . May the sanctity of the Two-headed Serpent's Seed of Forbidden Knowledge triumph over all profanity and may all sparks of divinity trapped within the wretched and fallen state of the creation become redeemed and liberated, through the Sowing and Reaping of Sinistral Death, incited by the Black Light of True Divinity. 61"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 ID4t @1igil nf t}Jt @1pirif s ittat4Iu Asttnt The Sigil of Spirit's Deathly Ascent is a sign related to the Fire-Born Dead of our Lineage of Sataninsam, to all that which is strived for through the Path of Thorns and to the very essence of the Qayinite Gnosis itself, but it is also interlinked with the mysteries of Anamlaqayin, being that of the Twin-Flame sired by the Two-Faced Serpent of Wisdom, made whole and perfect in their transcendent conjunction accomplished through Death.

The Sigil of Spirit's Deathly Ascent goes hand in hand with the Thirteen Pointed Star of the Gate of the Dead and the Key Sigil which opens it, but while they are linked to the similar concepts and essences they are so in different manners, as this sigil emphasises the spiritual achievements of those Mighty and Blessed Ones through and within Death and is not only connected to their souls upon earth but also to their Spirits in the Beyond/the Other Side.

The Spirit of the Mighty Dead is here represented in its Atavistic Ophitic aspect, rising upwards from the Triangle of Holy Pneumatic Fire, and transcending the limitations of enfleshment through the Point of the Skull/Death/Daath, whereby the day-born aspects are cast off and the Primal Serpentine Form is once again assumed. Of relevance is also the meaning of the main, middle, pillar unifying within itself the left/feminine and right/masculine aspects leading to the Conjunctio of the Spirit, represented by the One Serpent and the Eight-spoked Cross marking its acausal point of egress. Connected to these concepts are also the three Black Points found in the lower part of the sigil, signifying the Trinity of the Spirit Seeds of Satan, Taninsam and the Pearl of Awakened Wisdom-Spirit, unified and divided through the enfleshment caused by the birth of Qayin and Qalmana, and again made whole and as One by their entering into the Gates of Death/ Point of the Fire-Crowned Skull. The seven visible coils of the serpent around that vertical shaft of the Trident of the Holy Serpent Flame are also of relevance and encode both the connection of the sigil to the Seven Generations of Qayin and Qalmana before the flood and the Seven Gates and their Keys through which the union and ascent of Spirit was/is accomplished . The Sigil of Spirit's Deathly Ascent is a sign which can both adorn the altar of the Master and the Lady and that of the Mighty Dead, and serve as a focal point used during contemplation of the mysteries, meditations and the workings meant to recall those who through the route codified within its linear forms have already achieved its glorious promise. The key to the activation of this sigil lies fully within the realm of the Spirit, granted through revelation and Necrosophic Gnosis. 63"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"* + The Sigil of the Spirit's Deathly Ascent, being a sign of the Fire-Born Dead and linear codification of the goal strived for through the Great Work 64 . , � ·\"'! .,jj -�l QJ)p£-= ..

It is also not a physical sign per se, as often misunderstood by the profane, but a condition in which the Inner Flame of Divinity has been awakened unto itself and Knows what it is and where it belongs. It is in other words a sign of the Luciferian boons granted by the Nightside forces to the Spirit imprisoned within hylic forms and a mark showing its quickened state, in which it becomes adversarial to all that has restricted it. The Mark is not visible to the eyes of those belonging to the race of Adam and is a gloriole visible only to the Eye of Spirit and as such it is a sign of recognition between those who belong to the secret sodality of the Holy Serpent of Wisdom and all the Discarnate Ones serving the cause of liberation of the shards of divinity caught within the dungeons of fallen matter. The Mark is in essence formless, but has within different traditions been represented by various symbols. According to folk-tradition the most common symbols for the Mark of Qayin have been the cross and in some contexts even a horn or pair of horns. The mark of this cross, often believed to have been branded upon the forehead of Qayin, has most often been of the X-shaped variety, even though the Tau cross within some contexts also has been a symbol for it. This folkloric and exoteric symbolism is even manifested within the title of the Master, as employed within our Tradition, and is the reason for the alternative 65"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"spelling of Falcifer, which is the more common way to write the title of the Scythe-Bearer in Latin. By using the FalXifer spelling of His title we both separate Him from the general associations between the title Falcifer and the god Saturn and at the same time incorporate within His title the marking X at the centre. Falxifer becomes thus the Crucifer/the Cross-bearer and the cross, which within our workings is a most important symbol with many different attributions and meanings given to it, becomes here an exoteric aspect of That Mark. As the Master of the Crossroads of Death these titles and symbols become also more relevantly connected to Qayin, as He is the bearer and bringer of the liminality and sorcerous power of the X-cross, but also the bearer and establisher of the Luciferian � -cross, with the vertical line of the Descending Spirit intersecting and illuminating/ setting aflame the horizontal line representing the world and its elements of matter and darkness. When it comes to the symbolism connected to the mysteries of Gulgaltha the cross of the Cross-bearer gains additional meanings and becomes, amongst many other things, the pathway through which the chthonic realm is accessed by the living, the axis through which the shades of the dead are brought up and resurrected and at its centre a liminal point connecting the living and the dead to that which transcends both their limited forms of existence. It becomes also within such setting a symbol representing the Master Himself, as the one standing on top of the first grave. Even if all these important meanings are given to the cross, in its different forms, as a symbol of the Mark of Qayin it is still not the cross that within the esoteric work represents it. As disclosed within the Apocryphal Revelations of the Qayinite Genesis chapter the Mark of Qayin is esoterically represented by the unification of three separate symbolic parts, which when brought together represent that formless Mark of Spirit-Awakening Leading to Exile. The esoteric symbol of the Mark of Qayin consists of the following three parts: 66 ....... Point: 'ale .S.U Will: ..........

The primary symbolic colour of this Seed-Point of Spirit is Emerald Green, when representing the gift of Lucifer /N octifer, both in the case of their first and second blessing placed upon the Spirit of Qayin and Qalmana, as it in the primary form was a seed of the Fruit of their Love for the Spirit, plucked from the gardens of Nightside Venus and in the second blessing was in the form of the Emerald Stone, connected to that same spheres of influence, of the Crown of Lucifer placed upon their brows, as a sign of their Regal Awakening and Uprising of the Spirit. The secondary symbolic colour of this Point of Spirit is black, as the Pearl of Awakened Spirit-Wisdom through its alignment to and empowerment by the Sitra Ahra became blackened to reflect the anti-cosmic impulse of the Divine Light, as manifested on that Other Side. � The Serpent represents the intermediary force connecting the Spirit to the Other Side and through that Other Side to the Path of Nia leading to the Source of Divinity within the Fullness of Emptiness that is Ain. The serpentine form stands here for both the Sataninsam and their bridging over to the cosmos of the Demiurge, showing the connection made between that which is above, that which is within and that which is below, establishing a liminality through which the Seed of Spirit could be sown and the Emerald Stone of the Crown could be bestowed. The Serpent's Mark also signifies a Bringer and Scatterer of the Seeds of Spirit Endowment and one who would empower the Sparks of Spirit, wherever they may be bound, in order 67"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"to aid in the breaking of their Holding Vessels and thus facilitating their ascension. The symbolic colour of the serpent's mark is black, as it represents the Black Light of Divinity reacting in a disruptive fashion against that which would restrict the Holy Spirit. � The sickle represents the Harvest and the Harvester of the fruits of the Spirit and symbolises Action and Work as the means through which Gnosis is manifested and its rewards reaped. The Sickle is also the weapon of Wrathful Will, cutting that which would cause attachment or in any other way bind and restrict the Awakened Spirit and as such its symbolic colour is red, as it is the spiller of the blood which must water the Seeds of Spirit with the sacrifices of one's own clay-horn limitations of the ego. The mark of the reddened sickle stands for the force of separation; dividing that which is finite and that which in essence is deathless and infinite and is thus a symbol of the forceful path to liberation and transcendence. As a weapon and tool of murder the bloody sickle represents the antinomian approach and the opposition required against the Archonic Laws before the goal of the Great Work can be attained. These three separate parts when brought together manifest the One Esoteric sigil of the Mark of Qayin, taking the following form: The Esoteric Sigil of the Mark of Qayin It is this Mark that according to Gnosis became fully placed upon Qayin and Qalmana in connection to their deeds of Murderous Rebellion and Love for the Spirit, which fully awakened them to their own True Selves and to the Other Side, to which they belonged and would transcend to. 68 'air sip of the Mark is ... �in different­-..rwt.o first. in PSSI ----af their lineage ....

Within the practical context of the Necrosophic Sorcery of Their Cult this sigil of the Mark is employed both within fetishistic and talismanic contexts, serving to emphasise and focus all the qualities represented by it. Within the workings of Holy Fetishes the sigil may be branded, carved or painted upon the idol, ideally upon the forehead of the skulls employed, in order to visibly connect it to the essential principals represented by the Mark and aid in the connection between its empty form and the Holiness it is to be charged with or connected to. In accordance to perceived Qayinite (and some would say Kenite) customs the sigil of the Mark can also be taken as a talismanic sign tattooed ritually upon the body, in order to create an outer manifestation of the Mark Within and further evoke the blessings and protection entitled to those bearing it. In such case the license to do so must first be asked for and granted by the Master and when so received it must be taken as a mark upon the left side of the body, ideally in a concealed spot, as it is not for the eyes of man that it is intended for. The ink employed for such tattoo should also be consecrated and empowered according to the guidance of the Familiar Shades and Spirits of the Path of Thorns and the marking of the body should commence during one of the auspicious dates of the cult. Such tattoo must be treated as a talisman and regularly be anointed with holy oils and fumigated in the smoke of incense offered up to the Master and His Lady and never be sported for the sake of the profane adornment of the flesh or for the furthering of the ego, as it in such cases changes meaning and attributes and instead marks the profaner as one worthy of nought but the reddening of the reaping blades of the true bearers of the Sickles of Qayin. 69"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 ID4.e ]l.eil.eb anb 1!\\ns.e-<ttrnwn.eb (@u.e.en The Mysteries of our Spiritual Blood Mother, the Twin-Bride of our Master, are of immense importance and crucial to enter in order to achieve the Necrosophic Gnosis, which will facilitate the lawless becoming leading to the coronations of the Spirit. The Holy Qalmana is in truth the other half of that which makes whole the Path of Thorns leading to apotheosis and reveals the correct means and modes by and through which it is successfully traversed. In ways similar to our Master Her soul dwells still upon the earth, in order to serve the cause of Her Spirit, enthroned in a state of unified wholeness on the Other Side. The secrets of Holy Qalmana are many and few of them can be truly comprehended without actual direct contact and interaction with Her blessed essence. Because She is the Veiled One, the Shrouded One and the Queen of All That Which Is Kept Hidden, She can only be approached via the Master, our Sancte Qayin, as it is only through Him that Her power and beauty can be reached and comprehended. This ties into the mysteries concerning their spiritual bound and unbroken connection and the fact that what affects one of them also affects the other. It is therefore again necessary to have had the essence of the Master enlinked to and seated for a sufficient amount of time before the Hidden Flower, that is the Beauteous Qalmana, can be beheld amongst all the piercing thorns and the broken bones trodden upon during the arduous crossing of the tortuous Path of Nod. 70 'lilt� therefore fialll • I - ibaal lic:ense 111!1111 �HerYIOI .... - I of Sorcerous ._ ... it tllerefore be � .... .., behold Her 11111111 ..... tt.oms and� -I of partakiJq; � .... :n:sund for HeNI ., ·� \"'• .

We have therefore first now, in this Second Book of Falxifer, received the spiritual license to start to outline some of the esoteric traditions concerning Her workings and offer a few insights into Her paradisal garden of Sorcerous Power, Death and Spiritual Rebirth. Let it therefore be known that the profane, who have not earned the right to behold Her beauty, will instead only get to know the sharpness of Her thorns and drink from the Envenomed Cup of Her Just Wrath, instead of partaking of Her Sweet Spirit Salving Nectar, which is a boon reserved for Her Faithful Children. Qalmana's identity has always been kept concealed and She has only been glimpsed through the apocryphal teachings and lore of certain esoteric cults and traditions of old, but even in such contexts She has most of the time been misrepresented and not given Her true and deserving elevated status and importance . The Holy Qalmana is the feminine aspect of the Spirit of Qayin made whole. She is the reflection of each of His manifestations and the one who balances and completes each of His deeds and achievements with Her own. Unto Qayin She is what Lilith is to Samael and She is therefore a most significant aspect of that which must be venerated, connected to and worked for and with, if the attainment of the full awakening, empowerment and liberation of the Spirit is to be achieved. In ways similar to Qayin our Lady Qalmana also possesses numerous aspects and modes of manifestation, all connected to the cause of Her being and becoming. Many of these aspects mirror those of Qayin and stand for the more feminine expressions of their Spirit and they are therefore wisely paired up and worked with within the same context, this in order to bring further completeness and focus to the sorcerous and spiritual manifestations sought within the different workings. This should on the other hand not be misunderstood as Her lack of 71"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"individual power, for in ways similar to how Master Qayin is worked with singly can also the Holy Mother be petitioned on Her own to lend Her aid to whatever one finds worthy of Her involvement and intervention. She wields powers as awe-inspiring as those of Her male counterpart and within certain contexts, pertaining to the more feminine nature of the work, Her sorcery will be even more effectively manifested, in ways similar to how the powers of Qayin may be better suited to call upon within certain other settings. It is in other words a question of the two being, in their divided aspects, as the polar opposite ends of the one and the same spirit-essence and therefore possessing complementary attributes in relation to each other, creating in all their forms of unification fullness and perfection. Amongst the many facets of Holy Qalmana reflecting the Master's most important aspects, such as the First Tiller, the First Killer, the First Gravedigger and the Lord of the Shadows of Death, can Qalmana's aspects as the Rose-Crowned Queen of Harvest, the Mistress of the Bloody Sickle, the Queen of Gulgaltha and the Baalatzelmoth be counted. But, beside these few cited aspects, which are overtly connected to the most crucial manifestations of Qayin, there are still many others connected to Him, in ways less obvious. Our Holy Qalmana is the Sower of the Seeds, the Bringer of Fruitfulness and Abundance. She is the Cause of Beauty, Sweetness and Redolence. She is the Enchantress, Spellbinder and Witch-Mother. She is the First Potion, Philtre and Perfume Maker. She is the Poisoner, the Deceiver of Foes and the Cunning Beguiler. She is the Commander of the Shades and Spirits of the Left Side. She is the Concealer, the Granter of Invisibility and the Keeper of Secrets. She is the Oath Binder, the Overseer of Pacts and the Upholder of Covenants.

She is the only one that can share altar with the Master and Her presence will even strengthen and complete His own manifestations. But, before any of Her physical fetishes and talismans can be consecrated and stationed upon the altar an astral and spiritual contact with Her must first be established. This is achieved through contemplation of Her role within the relevant mythos and the development of an intense longing for experiencing of Her holiness, beauty and spirit-strengthening Light. During this process of establishment of a conscious contact with the Holy Blood-Mother an amount of time must be reserved for Her contemplations, meditations and prayers, after the giving of offerings to the Master during each Monday night, but also during the late Venus and Saturn hours of Friday nights. In connection to these initial steps of Her veneration and the seeking out of Her links within and without, nought but a single red Rose needs to be presented upon the altar as Her sacred representation. This single red Rose and suitable Venusian incense burnt as a humble offering and a beckoning call to the one who granted all plants their fragrance is all that is required and when the time is right the faithful adorer of the Beauteous One will know of Her, Her approval and Her yearned-for presence. This blessed event can be experienced in many different manners, but most often it is dreams, omens and concrete signs which will signal Her coming forth and favourable reception. At that point a suitable 77"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"spot upon the altar should be created for Her, upon which an incense burner, a vase for the offerings of flowers, a cup for the giving and partaking of libations, Her esoteric sigil inscribed and painted in black upon a red disk of wood, clay, ceramic or stone and a candle holder with one single red candle are placed. The sigil disc must be fashioned in such a manner that it can withstand being anointed with perfumes, tinctures, libations and oils, as it is through those things which bear the traces of Her own blessings that the sigil in question can become activated. Upon the candle, which must be cleansed first with Tincture of Rue, the characters/keys from around Her esoteric sigil are to be inscribed vertically, from top to the bottom of the candle, starting with the character inside the double circle underneath the sickle at the centre of the sigil and then continuing in the anticlockwise direction, inscribing each of the succeeding characters upon Her candle. The candle is then to be anointed with the oil of Rose or Lilac and prayed over, with invocations directed at Holy Qalmana entreating Her to imbue it with Her Light and make it shine through its flame. It is first after the seventh repetition of Her Formula of Calling that the candle of Qalmana is to be lit and its flame will at that point act as an outer manifestation of Her Fiery Blood within, and as such should during the spiritual workings be seen with the Mind's Eye to burn black, reflecting Her Light of Spirit. The sigil plate can, within this context where it serves as a talismanic fetish, after having being anointed and fumigated in sweet incense act as a focal point, a point of power upon which workings are placed or be placed underneath Her candle in order to further the shining forth of Her Holiness.

Such Point of Attraction must be created by the way of the conjunction of the essential elements of plants, minerals and animals, which through the correct rites of harvest, consecration and sacrifice will empower the sanctifying baths and tinctures through which suitable vessels fit to act as a point of ingress for Her Unceasing Soul and Transcendent Spirit can become hallowed and charged. The exact approach for such work will not be outlined in this book, as She, the Veiled One, has not wished for it nor given the spiritual license to the scribe of the book to fully disclose such mysteries, but those who study, practice and experience the truth and power of all else that has been disclosed, both in the First and now this Second Book of Falxifer, will become able to read between the lines and, through the guidance of the Master, the Lady Herself and the Faithful Famuli, be able to find any missing element needed but still unmentioned and finally create the ablutions and tinctures demanded for the consecration of Her most sacred idols. The form of such idols must always be worthy of Her beauty and take shapes related to the astral and mental forms Her essence has expressed itself through in connection to all the workings leading up the creation, or otherwise acquiring, of such Vessels of Holiness. Some of the most often employed forms are those of a beautiful woman, adorned and crowned with roses, holding a sickle in her left hand, or having such a tool by her feet. Other times, and for the seating of other aspects of Her essence, fetish skulls may be employed and within such settings the skulls are often stained scarlet red, perfumed, loaded, crowned in 79"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"the appropriate manner and finally, after their full consecration, veiled. Whichever form these fetishes take they must always be made worthy of that which is to be connected to through them and be adored accordingly. An important part of the veneration of Her idols is their anointment with sacred perfumes and oils created and consecrated in Her name, possessing the power to amplify Her presence. As the full telestic seating of Holy Qalmana is reserved for those that have walked the Path of Thorns far enough to, by their watering of the soil with their own lifeblood, be granted glimpses of the rising Garden of Roses (the Rosarium of Nod), the main approach to Our Lady's power within the practical setting will remain through the employment of Her sacred sigils, as they possess the ability to reach Her, even without having Her fully enthroned upon the altar. 80 1'!111 �i '� � <Our &btl� \"\"\"i �j As already stated the mail Lady is reached and \\� to the workings of the Q imprints of Her presence -I and/or the codified � Light.

The sigils of Qalmana are so important and strongly attached to Her that they almost fill the same functions as the Master's fetishes, within the context of Her veneration and sorcery. Besides being foundations of many ritual workings based and placed upon them, they also serve as most powerful talismans and do in their activated forms possess strong enlinkments to Her soul, spirit and to that which She through them masters, and all such qualities these sigils can impart unto that which is placed upon, close to or in a becoming manner marked with them. Similar to Our Master Qayin the Rose-Crowned Queen also possesses Her own set of Seven Key Sigils, opening up the gates to Her Gardens of Blessings and Curses, each being connected to and channelling a specific facet of Her sorcerous might. With each Key Sigil a short description and a few suggestions concerning their practical employment are given, but it must be stressed that they are in no way limited to the few simple approaches here outlined and that they can be worked in a multitude of other ways, all by the grace and through the guidance of the Holy Blood-Mother Herself. 81"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"It is also here once again possible to combine the powers of the sigils with those of Her Key Sigils, in order to unlock the hidden gates and through the correct turning of the keys open up the paths to Her Glorious Might.

It is a point of ingress for Her Light from the Other Side and a link to Her most elevated powers unbound by the chains of Demiurgic creation. This sigil is employed within the workings of High Magic, religious adoration and communion, contemplation of Her mysteries and the channelling of the spirit-strengthening Lumina of Her Crowning Fire. This Esoteric Sigil of Qalmana serves well as Her main focal point upon the altar and should during the initial steps of Her veneration be Her only representation upon the altar of Her Other Half, the Blessed Qayin. The activation of this sigil can, because of its strong spiritual enlinkments and immense value when it comes to establishing a conscious contact with the Rose-Crowned Queen, be both very simple and very complex, all depending on the context and on one's own level of initiation into Her mysteries. The simpler forms of its activation demand the recitation of Her Formula of Calling and Invocation, the lighting of Her flame upon the altar, the burning of suitable incense offering and the anointing of its traced lines with consecrated oils and perfumes. But, the most important part of the opening of the gate of this sigil remains an internal process, as it is the spiritual love and longing for Her blessed presence that in the end will establish the links between one's own and Her Holy Spirit. 83"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Within more advanced workings the sigil is to be traced with Her ensouled red chalk upon a black cloth and then become fully activated by the chanting of Her Formula of Calling, the strewing of flower petals around its keyed borders, the sprinkling of suitable libations, the offering of fragrant smoke of sweet incense, the correct setting of sacred flames and the assumption of the right frame of mind caused by the realisation of some of Her hidden mysteries. 84 j ,., -\"llle Son:el)· Sigil of L1J1 .. s-.:te Qa)in aDd • -d channellin& .. � the context of d • -•' points of spidl� * will and cause flf j •..-:5 all Her \"it� _.Wessi'W' empawa� ..

This sigil opens up the liminal points of spirit under Her royal dominion and aligns them to the will and cause of the one accessing Her powers through it. It serves all Her witchcraft and possesses the ability to access and direct Her blessings, empowerments, enchantments and commanding powers. This Sorcery Sigil is a foundation upon which workings are to be based and placed and can act as a two-dimensional altar and a foundation for the manifestation of Her unnatural power to alter and manipulate the aspects of nature once blessed by Her own enspiriting presence. This sigil is a very powerful means for the consecration and charging with power of different tools employed in connection to the casting of Her spells, like for example pieces of chalk, copper talismans, candles, oil lamps, reaping blades, styluses and any other such implements of magic. The Sorcery Sigil of Lebuda also possesses protective powers, beside its empowering qualities upon the magically focused emanations of one's will, and can be employed as a potent talisman to carry hidden on one's person in order to become covered by the aureole of Her Holy Soul and gain additional strengthening to all enchantments cast in Her names. 85"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The sigil is activated by being traced in a suitable manner, the chanting of Her Formula of Calling, flames of three red or half-red and half­black candles, this depending on the nature of the work, smoke of an incense blend consisting of elements from three plants under Her power corresponding with the specific work at hand, libation offerings of strong liquor and the strewing of red Rose petals around the circle of the sigil. 86 Ji! .. .. .. &raping SickJes .. �sigilait .. -juas worki.np of Jill 1 ' 55 of the � 1 .. npe:seuts the ...

This is the sigil of the Murderer of Kelimath and represents the death dealing and vengeful aspect of the Holy Mother, acting as the destructive impulse of the Spirit upon that which would keep it from its Lawless Becoming, Ascension and Divine Unification. This sigil of the reaping and bloodied sickles of Liluwa, being the Seed of Lilith born through Hawa/Uwa, is the poison cup emptied, the trident of Crowning Fire stabbed into the earth, the establishment of the burial mound of Murder Concealed and the Black Cross-roads of Unfated Death paved. Through this sigil Her just vengeance is brought upon the defilers of sanctity and those blocking the paths of the Awakened Spirits of Her Bloodline.

It is a granter of Her authority, blessing and protection, bringing Her empowerments to the one bearing it as talisman or to that which is marked with or placed upon it. This sigil is a badge of the harvester of that which has been sowed in Her sacred names and an insignia of one faithful to the Spirits Guised In Green, and is therefore also a sign by and through which they bestow their blessings and themselves become blessed. This sigil possesses Her powers to cause spiritual growth and expansion of personal power and is as an amplifier of Her blessings and therefore only employed as talisman by those within Her cult, having access to Her powers and deserving Her boons. Amongst the powers of the sigil, when employed as talisman, can those of becharming, the strengthening of the bounds of spiritual love and the obtainment of wealth be counted. It is also well paired with some of Qalmana's other sigils and Key Sigil, which can be marked on its opposite side or traced around it, and can within such contexts focus the Point of Power created and effectively aid in the harvest of the blessings of Our Ever Reaping Lady.

This sigil is to be employed when the herbal elements are to be specifically consecrated through the powers of Qalmana and whenever the Black In Green specially faithful to Her are to be called back and re-seated within their corresponding plant elements. In keyed form it serves similar purposes as the keyed Green Point of Qayin and serves the consecration and ensoulment of Her aspect-specific fetishes and talismans, connected to Her role as the Sower, the Reaper and the Crowned Queen of the Black In Green. The uses and modes of activation of this sigil reflect that which will be fully outlined in the coming chapter concerning Qayin's Green Point of the Skull, with the only differences in the activation of Qalmana's Green Point of the Skull being the obvious deviations when it comes to the Formula of Calling employed and the fact that She favours Rose, Cherry or Vanilla scented cigars and cigarillos. 91"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ID4.e (@u.e.eu nf <&ulgaltlJa �igil The Queen of Gulgaltha sigil is a connecting point to the aspect of Qalmana reigning over the Cemeteries, together with Qayin in His aspect as the Lord of the Black Cross.

The Key Sigil of Subjugation binds both the living and the dead to one's own service, through the regal power of Holy Qalmana, and places unbreakable shackles upon others, if need be, in order to subjugate their volitions and make them do one's own biddings. This Key Sigil is a forceful breaker of wills and linear conjuration of the most stern and commanding powers of the Rose­Crowned Queen, possessing the conquering power to place beneath one's feet even the most unruly. The Key Sigil of Subjugation can be employed in a multitude of different ways and be incorporated into every rite that has as goal to defeat another entities' will through the dominating powers of Holy Qalmana . For example, it can, within the rites of ligature, be written with Sanctified Ink upon red or purple ribbons, which then are used to bind the effigy embodying the target. It can be carved upon red or purple candles placed on top of the links to the one meant to become dominated. It can adorn the wands of Qalmana, meant to act as Her Ruling Sceptres, for the commanding and the enforcing of one's own will upon others, or be inscribed upon talismans meant to confer lordship, mastery and dominion. The Key Sigil of Subjugation grants power to the one who uses it properly, by seizing and defeating the will power of those against whom it is used. When written on a piece of parchment with the suitable Ink of the Art connected to its own sphere of influence, and then burnt in the candle flame of the Forceful Queen the ashes so produced can become a most empowering element to blend with other formulae meant for the subjugation of the will of others, such as sprinkling powders, oils or incense, and in some cases even for the mixing with Tobacco for the employment of the dominating powers of Good Amiahzatan. 95"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"fKtn &igil No. 2 '*IK0999�)b� The Second Key Sigil of Qalmana is that of Becharming and is the Key Sigil used in order to turn and enflame the hearts of those upon whom its enamouring enchantments are cast. The Key Sigil of Becharming possesses the power to cast spells of glamour and confer grace, beauty and charm in the minds and eyes of others and is employed within all workings of amatory magic driving power from the Beauteous Queen of Roses. This Key Sigil is a conferrer of an irresistible and charismatic aura and a cause of attraction and sympathy towards the one who would use it properly. The Key Sigil of Becharming can bestow its powers through many different ritual techniques and can empower any work or talisman harmonious with its own cause. For example, it can be inscribed upon a thin sheet of copper, which becomes consecrated and empowered through the sorceries of Qalmana and then rolled into a tight scroll and dropped into a bottle of perfume, in order to charge the perfume with its spellbinding powers. Such consecrated copper scroll, bearing the engraving and power of this Key Sigil, when stringed on a red cord and hung around the neck will serve as a most powerful talisman of amorous allurement. This Key Sigil can also be inscribed upon red candles used during the rites of love-witching, become traced with sanctified red ink on white plates, upon which such candles are burnt, or in different ways become employed within the workings performed through enchanting lamps, fuelled with oils and perfumes extracted from Venusian plants. When written with blood of a dove, sparrow or a rabbit on a piece of parchment this Key Sigil will constitute a most potent talisman, imparting great charm and power of attraction, to carry on one's person and if written with an ink consisting of three drops of blood from one's own left hand's ring finger, mixed with one drop of honey and seven drops of rose water, upon a thin and small piece of paper, 96 ills enchantment can .. � of Qalmana � ��-'illll >ill 4* l!ll -.third Key sigil ote .. used in order to IIIII ...

The Key Sigil of Oath Binding possesses the power to tie souls and spirits in accordance with the words and signs uttered or written in mutual agreement and places the Mighty Qalmana's unbreakable seal upon all such pacts. This Key Sigil places man and spirit under oaths meant to further the cause of Qalmana and Her twin brother, Our Master Qayin, and it assures that all that is avowed is kept true and that otherwise Her most pernicious sentences befall the one forswearing the solemn and formal agreements it has sealed. The Key Sigil of Oath Binding can within the practical context be used in many different ways, but most often it is used as the finalising signature of a written pact or otherwise employed as the representation of Her sanctifying presence, under which secret alliances are entered into or binding promises given. If human allies are to sign and seal a treaty with this Key Sigil three drops from each person's left-hand ring finger are to be mixed into a red, purified and dedicated ink, which then is used for the drawing the Key Sigil above their written agreement, in order to seal it by the Might of Qalmana. In similar way can this key sigil, written upon a piece of parchment, with such ink intermingled with the blood of those swearing to uphold an agreement in Her name, be rolled around the stem of a single red Rose, which then is held over the head of each person involved in the oath binding process, while the pact is verbally pronounced by the person standing beneath the Rose.

Thus the pact becomes sealed by the power of the Rose-Crowned Queen, through Blood and Fire, and all involved parties become bound to uphold their covenant in the strictest of secrecy, as by the murder of Kelimat all that which is placed underneath the Rose (Sub Rosa) must be kept secret. In other contexts it is enough to just mark the Key Sigil of Oath Binding in some suitable manner in connection to agreements entered into with spirits and shades, for example by writing it with sanctified ink underneath written pacts or marking it with chalk upon the ground, upon trunk of trees or on the back of gravestones, all depending on the context, but it is important that both parties have agreed before this Key Sigil is employed and one must therefore through divinatory means first come to a clear understanding before Qalmana's power can, through this linear evocation of Her authority, be used for the sealing of the deal. i!\\rtt Sigil Nn. 4 �++�7 The fourth Key Sigil is that of Abundance and is the Key Sigil used in order to conjure wealth, fortune and a plentiful harvest, all in accordance to one's own correct sowing of the seeds of that which is to be reaped. The Key Sigil of Abundance is a wordless prayer to Our Lady of Good Harvest for the granting of the boons of Her increasing powers of growth and is a point of connection to Her fertile aspect as the Mistress of the Fruitful Gardens of Venus. This Key Sigil, when employed correctly, banishes the blighting influences which otherwise could ruin one's crop and aids in the flourishing of one's affluence. The Key Sigil of Abundance can aid in all forms of workings aligned with its own cause and effect and serves well the talismanic arts meant to focus and attract such influences.

In similar ways it can be paired with other plant elements harmonious with its intended power and act as the foundation of many such fetish-bundles, possessing the power to increase one's fortune and earnings. Besides being written on parchment and purified paper, or inscribed on sheets of copper, this Key Sigil serves also well all forms of candle magic, by being scratched upon the cleansed wax of a green candle with a copper nail, before it is duly anointed and dressed with suitable elements. In similar ways it can further other Rites of Flame, by being incorporated into magically charged oil lamps or by being written on certain leaves which then are fed to the fire in order to attract and cause the wanted prosperous manifestations and outcomes. For the blessing of an actual acre to be sown with seeds this Key Sigil is marked upon the soil itself with the tip of a wand consecrated through the powers of Qalmana, having been harvested from one of Her faithful Black In Green possessing the attributes connected to this Key Sigil. By inscribing the Key Sigil in question seven times upon the ground and then staking out the plot by placing four green candles, marked with the Key Sigil, one on each of the four corners and lighting them in Qalmana's name the soil will become blessed by Her Sanctitude. IKeu i'igil Nn. 5 The fifth Key Sigil is that of Concealment and is the Key Sigil used within all workings meant to keep hidden, cloak in shadows and make invisible that which must be protected by enduring secrecy, all through the sorcerous power of the Veiled Queen. The Key Sigil of Concealment is a bringer of darkness upon the eyes and minds of others and is a means through which Her powers are made manifested in order to 99"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"obstruct and mislead those against whom the Holy Mother's gifts of concealment are sought. This Key Sigil is a shroud covering that which it is placed upon, shielding it from the detection of both man and spirits. The Key Sigil of Concealment can be employed within all settings necessitating the hindering of the discovery of any person, deed or thing and while not possessing the power to grant physical invisibility its powers to avert attention will make that which its sorcerous powers are placed upon go unnoticed. For example, it can be written with the suitable Sanctified Ink upon a sheet of parchment or cleansed paper, together with other magical signs and written petitions evoking concealment or directing the influences focused to blind and confuse certain individuals, like within some of the workings done against the law. The ashes from such written talismans burnt in the altar flame of Qalmana can effectively be incorporated into talismanic sachets or oils of concealment. If inscribed on a thin band of copper, become consecrated with the essences of suitable plant elements and offerings, and then rolled up into a scroll it constitutes a powerful talisman of invisibility, for wearing upon one's person or for placing in the proximity of that which is to be kept hidden. This Key Sigil can also be marked upon the ritually obtained femur or tibia bone of a black cat in order to create an even more potent talisman of concealment, with the powers of misleading and blinding all those from whom one's presence would need to be kept enshrouded. fKtu t;tgil Nn. 6 -t�mr.�� ft � The sixth Key Sigil is that of Chastisement and is the Key Sigil used within all the rites of punishment and revenge, during which the wrathful aspect of the Lady of the Bloody Sickle is called upon to afflict a deserving target.

This Key Sigil is as the thorns of the Rose, protecting that which is sacred, good and beautiful, by spilling the blood of those who would harm or defile it. The Key Sigil of Chastisement is employed within all settings where Sancta Qalmana is petitioned to harshly punish an offender and it acts within such contexts as the conductor of all the poisonous and harmful influences falling under Her royal jurisdiction, from both the Kingdom of Green and the Kingdom of the Dead. It will within such settings direct all emanations connected to Her towards the baleful affliction of the target and enclose the person within a circle of Martial Fire and Saturnian Poison, while jabbing him/her from all directions with the thorns of the Fell Garden of Malediction. There are many different ways this Key Sigil can be used and it can find a place within almost all forms of aggressive techniques of sorcery and witchcraft. For example, it can be drawn with consecrated chalk, containing enspirited elements pertaining to the nature of this Key Sigil, upon any suitable surface in proximity to the dwelling place of the target, such as upon the road leading to and fro the person's home, upon the trunk of a suitable tree facing it or even upon the walls or door of the house itself, all depending upon that which is most fitting for the specific situation . The Key Sigil can also be inscribed with a rusty nail upon the back of a figure candle consecrated according to the rite for the Enlinkment of Sympathetic Effigies. The candle is then anointed with the venom of seven Black In Green faithful to Qalmana and pierced with 49 thorns and taken to a T -shaped cemetery crossroads and there lit in Qalmana's name, in order to combine the deadly powers of the plant spirits with those of the Dark Dead. Within other contexts this Key Sigil can be used in less elaborate candle burning rituals and become inscribed upon a black candle, 101"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"which then is anointed with suitable oil in harmony with its cause and placed upon the links of the target of the work. Such candle, when lit during the petitioning of the Lady of the Bloodstained Garden, can effectively direct Her deadly emanations towards the one deserving Her punishments. When written seven times with venomous ink upon a piece of parchment, which then is burnt in the flame of an offertory black candle lit for Qalmana, the ashes so produced will greatly empower all formulae reserved for cursing, be it for powders, oils or incense and when written in similar fashion across the photo of the target and the photo placed underneath of one of Our Lady's fetishes, it will direct Her punishing influences effectively upon the whole being of the person so cursed and placed beneath Her feet. 1Ktn �igil No. 7 :tusot;�S<>h� The seventh Key Sigil is that of Consecration and is the Key Sigil employed within all rites of blessing and empowerment drawing spiritual essence from the Holy Qalmana. The Key sigil of Consecration is connected to the aspects of the sorcerous might of the Lady being the polar opposite end to those evoked through the sixth Key Sigil and it channels nought but Her benevolence and sanctitude, for the sake of Her faithful. This Key Sigil is a connection to Her ensouling and enspiriting boons, granted to the receptive while She walked in life and still being granted by Her, even in and through Death. The Key Sigil of Consecration is employed within all rites meant to channel Her blessings and empowerments, be it towards, upon and into a person, a thing or even a shade or a spirit. It can, for example, be used within the workings meant to reward someone through Her powers or when Her essence is to be seated within some talismanic form.

As a talisman this Key Sigil can lend many of the blessings and the protection of Qalmana and serves amply to enhance the powers of any of Her other talismans and amulets that it can become combined with. Within other context this Key Sigil can be used for all general empowerments and consecrations and can direct Her power to infuse powders, oils, tinctures, perfumes, distils or anything else in need of Her blessing touch. If branded, or otherwise marked, upon one of Her wands it can create a powerful tool for the stirring of potions and other kinds of mixtures, bringing the blessings of Qalmana, filtered through the attributes of the Black In Green of the wand, in to that which it would stir. Within the rites of fetishism and ensoulment of idols this Key Sigil serves most efficaciously, as it acts as a focusing and drawing point for Her soul and Holy Spirit and strengthens all Her emanations within such contexts of earthly enthroning. Most often this Key Sigil is best manifested by being inscribed upon a thin sheet of copper, which then must receive the consecrations of Qalmana, so that it can in turn become capable to amplify, hold and/ or reflect the power of all such consecrating blessings . 103"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 Wl}t 1!\\nsaries nf tl}t 1!\\nse (@ueen Rosarium or Rosary, signifying both a Rose-Garden, a garland of roses and a string of prayer beads, is of course something intimately connected to the sorceries of the Holy Qalmana, being that She is the Queen of the Rose-Garden of Venus and the one who hears the wordless prayers of the faithful.

For the black and white rosary the spacing beads are made out of bone and each of these beads are to have been buried at a separate cemetery for 7 nights each, in a place of power specifically connected to Her aspect as the Queen of Gulgaltha, so that each of them become connected to the powers of a cemetery and so that the seven of them together constitute the One Link to the wholeness of the Sevenfold Power of Field of Skulls, before they are strung on Her rosary. The red and black rosary is connected to Qalmana's aspects as the Witch-Mother and the Mistress of All Sorceries.

The blades of these tools of harvest take two forms; one is curved and sickle shaped and the other straight bladed and in the form of a knife. Both of these blades serve their own share of the work and are of equal importance. The sickle serves the harvesting of herbs and other more delicate plant elements and possesses the ability to reap the full spiritual powers of their Black In Green, through the authority of their Supreme Queen, while the knife, most often with a long and heavy blade, serves to harvest branches and other more sturdy parts of the plants needed for Her work. The blade of the Sickle of Qalmana is traditionally made out of copper and its handle made out of the wood of one of Her sacred trees. Similar to the Venefic Sickle of Qayin also Qalmana's harvesting blades are to be adorned and blessed with the specific set of sigils connected to the ruling treaties granting the cutting blades Her blessings, curses and full empowerments. The handle part of the Sickle Sigil of Qalmana is to be branded and the blade part of it is to be engraved or otherwise permanently marked. As a small offering in return for all the Blood of Green that the sickle is to spill, it must after its marking draw blood from the left hand of the one meant to physically wield it. If the blade is sharp enough 107"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"to draw blood from the flesh it will also be fit for the Sacred Rites of Harvest. The blood so spilt is to be smeared upon the blade as a reminder of the fact that power demands power and that every harvest has its price. By the markings and the anointment with blood the sickle becomes connected to the blade with which Qalmana Herself reaped and still reaps, and it becomes ready for its final stage of consecration, via the rites of ablution, during which the harvested flowers from seven plants most closely connected to the Holy Mother are made to transfer their spiritual virtues to the sickle, by the extraction and transfer of their essences via a suitable solvent, such as water ritually collected from a place of power or strong liquor that has been prayed over, for the making of a strong tincture. After having been marked, bloodied and washed in and by the unified powers of the seven Black In Green faithful to Qalmana, the sickle is to be placed upon Her Sorcery Sigil, or Her Green Point of the Skull, and there, according to the correct mode of activation of the sigil chosen, be given the final sanctification and the sealing of the powers bound to and within it. After 24 hours the Sickle of Qalmana will be fully empowered and removed from the sigil, wrapped in green silk and kept upon the altar. 108 • , ..

The handle part of the Sickle Sigil retains its shape, but its curved part intended for the marking of the blade must be changed into a straight form, fitting the blade of the knife. As for the blade the copper must here become replaced by steel or iron and the tabu against those metals become here overridden, through the enchanting and taming of the fires of the martial blade, by the powers of the Witch-Mother Qalmana. This is achieved by placing the container of infusion or tincture, in which the knife is to be washed, directly upon the proper activated sigil of Qalmana and then first washing and then letting the knife remain submerged in the empowering, and in this case taming, bath for at least 24 hours, during which the sigil upon which the work is placed is kept activated by the power of the flames set upon it. After the 24 hours the knife can be retrieved, dried, oiled and kept wrapped in green silk, until it is needed for the Good Work of the Lady, be it for benediction or malediction.

The powers of this insignia of the Master Qatsiyr can be compared to a combination of His Nigromancy and Falx Bellicum sigils, with the addition of His aspect-specific essence as the Master of all Venefic Arts and the Sovereign of all spirits of the Green Kingdom and can therefore serve all rites in which the Black In Green are to be charged, called back, empowered or worked with in any other form through His direct involvement, authority and grace. Through this insignia the path of the First Akeldama can be opened and the spirits of the plants, once awakened by the blood of the First Murdered, can be summoned and communed with, both for the sake of sorceries base and exalted, as that Field both covers the nadir and 117"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"reaches up towards the zenith of His, and therefore also our own, Becoming upon the Thorny Path of Nod. This insignia is a locked gate with a twofold key consisting of Qayin Qatsiyr's Formula of Calling and a ritual procedure through which the key is turned and the power of Green Point of the Skull made activated and accessible. The worded formula in question calls upon the Master in His aspects of the Father and Sower, the Planter, the Ploughman, the Bearer of Thorns, the Reaper, the Poison Bringer, the Lord of the Tree of Death, the Monarch of Green Death, the Master of the Sickle, the Harvester of God and the Son of the Devil. The following is Master Qatsiyr's Formula of Calling: Veni Qayin Sator, Consitor et Arator! Veni, veni Spinifer, Messor et Venenifer! Veni Dominor Arbor Mortis! Veni, veni Rex Mars Viridis! Veni Baal-Maggal et Qatsiyrel! Veni Qayin ben Samael! (x7) For the ritual procedure of the activation of the Green Point of the Skull, through which the powers called upon through the given formula are accessed and directed, four green candles, one black candle, liquor and a cigar are required. The insignia is to be marked in a suitable manner on a fitting surface, such as with ensouled or otherwise sanctified black or green ink, paint or chalk upon a piece of green or black cloth, a piece of flat wood or on a cleansed and suitable sized piece of paper or parchment. Liquor is then to be sprayed from the mouth three times over the insignia in order to water it. The cigar is lit in traditional manner and its smoke blown at all parts of the insignia in order to further activate it, while prayers through the smoke are given to the Master concerning the reason for why His powers are roused through the Green Point. 118 w.r-..�� ...-..:s of JKM\"er wiiJii 1 -;w!!!faed upon the II ..... planteJ.m .l I ... •ith the i �flat� .... i$ positioned·• ' l WR peen cand1es ·� • b of Callinci I i I MM!!St green c=----•• until the ro-1 iilpaa flame and ... ..... tbe�alt -Gftl' the 6ft. �. -\" •r s point when.._ ... - Uld tbe alii .... tbeGreea. ....

The green candles are to be given flame first, while Qayin Qatsiyr's Formula of Calling is chanted once over each, starting with the uppermost green candle and moving downwards in a widdershins motion until the fourth green candle is lit, and then the black candle is given flame and the formula is chanted three times over its flame, so that the Calling of Master Qatsiyr has been intoned all in all seven times over the five flames. At that point when the insignia has been planted, given libation, smoke and fire and the calling has been chanted for the seventh time, the Point of the Green Skull will have been fully activated and opened, and the Black of the Green placed upon it becomes summoned by the power of Qayin the Tiller and brought back, quickened and charged directly by His sorcerous might and their consecrated element assumes thus qualities similar to correctly ritually harvested plants and becomes enspirited by their corresponding daemons.

These faithful allies to our cause and assistants in Our Great Work are the embodied spirits of some of the intruding forces of the Sitra Ahra, the portions of the diluted divine essence that they empowered, awakened and aligned to the Cause of the Black Light and the spirits of the many Nephilum and other Mighty Dead that later became seated within the liminal points of the forests and gardens of this world. The intruding powers from the Sitra Ahra are the ones brought into this world through Our Master Qayin's and Our Lady Qalmana's first acts of blood sacrifice, which stained red the green and opened up the jaws of the parched earth and connected the first tombs to the unlocked gate of the Nahemothic realm. As the First Tillers became the First Murderers, the very nature of the plant kingdom became altered and the shadow-vessel of each and every plant sowed, cared for and harvested by our Master Qayin Qatsiyr and His Rose-Crowned Bride, our Blood-Mother Qalmana, became thus affected and unnaturally enspirited. Because of this there are two aspects to each plant in this world; one being the profane aspect serving the Law of Nature and the other constituting the Hidden Black In Green; being spirits not installed within them by the Demiurge of this world but instead shards of that holy crystallized Black Azoth from and/ or aligned to that Other Side, endowed to them through the deeds of the two First-Born of the Bloodline of the Janus-faced and Doubly Cunning Serpent Sataninsam. 123"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Thus the material corpus of each plant that at first, because of the Demiurgic act of spiritual diluting, did not possess any other virtues, but those of the four material elements, received a hidden Quinta Essentia, because of the blessings and curses brought upon and through Qayin and Qalmana. Within our Work it is these Spirits Hidden In Green that we venerate through both solemn and ecstatic rites of worship and sacrifice. Our faithfulness and admiration is thus never primarily directed to the material portion of each plant but instead to that Hidden Part, which in ways unseen and uncomprehended by the profane race of Adam is connected to the Pneumatic Flames burning within our own selves.

She can cause drowning, but also grant protection against it. Her dominion is specifically over the souls of the suicides and murder victims that have died by drowning. She possesses also great power over the darker races of the faerie, especially the ones most adverse towards the race of Adam inhabiting bogs, swamps and the liminal marshes. This daemon is also very strong when it comes to protective rituals aimed at the reversal and removal of curses, as she holds sway over many kinds of baneful currents and can open and close the doors between the target and the poisoned currents directed towards him/ her. A ritually harvested Alder wand empowered by this daemon is therefore the key to immense powers coveted by most sorcerers, spirit-workers and necromancers as it can, by the grace of its daemon, grant the powers of prophecy and spirit-sight, and lend protection and control over many dark shades and spirits. The Alder daemon is one of the Black In Green beloved by and devoted to Qalmana, and it is in Her holy names that this daemon's blessings and empowerments can be obtained. 125"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Almnnb (Prunus dulcis) The daemon of the (sweet) Almond tree is a bringer of abundance, wealth and riches.

She can point out secret tombs and the hidden treasures of the dead and grant the power of soul-flight within the context of sabbatic sorcery. Her powers are most accessible during night-time, when the enchanting scent of her flowers signals her awakened presence.

Her powers to bless reaches beyond the realm of the living and can also strengthen and comfort the dead and she is therefore often entreated to attend within the contexts of non-coercive necromancy.

He is a mighty shield against the parasitic larvae and other possessive shades that may become attached to the souls of the living and can effectively repel and banish them, but because of his hidden connections to the spheres of death and the dead, he can also use his fires to heat up, agitate and quicken such shades and spirits inhabiting the lower astral, all in accordance to how he is petitioned. Within the rites of spirit summoning, he is often employed in order to aid in the manifestation of the spirits evoked and can within such context grant active energetic substance through which the disincarnate may move within and affect the material realm. He can protect against and break the curses of the enemy and bring bitterness and misfortune to those that his wrath is turned against. The daemon of the Wormwood is also a granter of the Second Sight and a conferrer of the powers of divination and prophecy, especially when paired with the spirit of Mugworth, and can aid in the mastering of necromancy, oneiromancy, enoptromancy and libanomancy. He is also well known for his ability to strengthen any and all psychic abilities possessed by those that he chooses to bless, but he can also enflame the mind of man in harsher manners in order to afflict with delusion and madness. All parts of the Wormwood, when empowered by this daemon, will act as potent links to his powers and may be employed within sachets, strewing powders, amulets, incense, tinctures, infusions, oils and in many other ways, all depending on intention and context. 217"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 ID}Jt l\\ctiuatinn anb l\\ppliratinns nf tq.e �naturt5 rif tltt 9llark 1Jn <&r.e.en Each signature of the Black In Green presented in this book, or otherwise received from the spirits seated within the Green Points of Nature, are direct links to their non-corporal and quintessential aspects. Within the lines of each signature is manifested the flow, mode of manifestation, direction and points of power belonging to the spirit in question. The signatures are thus the foundations upon which further manifestation of the corresponding spirits can be built, worked with and directed through and should be understood as paths or gates to be opened for their ingress, egress and congress. As each signature is a physical impression of an already occurred manifestation of the spirit, it possesses the power to aid in and provoke the reoccurence of such manifestations, by the power of actual enlinkment between the trace it carries and constitutes, that which has traced it and the mode through which it was first made manifest. The signatures also ensure that the aspects of each plant accessed through them are fully in harmony with the specific context within which the sorcerous work is to be conducted and that the spirits so contacted are the ones aligned to and allied with the Tradition through which these mysteries are re-presented. Each signature must therefore be realised as a concrete and specific calling to the corresponding spirit, with the intentions and spiritual 218 -... tallm .. llllllkiwd.r���e .. ..... ilisexpr j t f,.nj ';·,:j ,... --it comes to .... :+ I less of wayll • ..... all settinp ... ..

When it comes to the practical applications of these signatures, there are countless of ways through which they can be worked and employed within all settings where the influences of the Black In Green are sought. The key to the activation of the plant-spirit signatures is most often an act of vivifying empowerment through the conjunction of the linear forms of the signatures with sympathetic and energetic elements of enlinkment obtained through the physical share of the corresponding plant. As an example can the use of sanctified ink (or paint), infused with the extracted essence of the plant of the Black In Green whose signature one seeks to activate, be mentioned, as such method is one of the most practical, effective and most often employed . In other working where chalk or powders are employed for the tracing of the signatures the corresponding herbal elements must, in similar ways as when inks are sanctified, become introduced into the chalk or the powder. As both the signatures and the plant elements belonging to the Black In Green hold links to the related spirit their unification will strengthen the bounds and establish the connection sought, but before the herbal element can be conjoined with the signature it must first be consecrated, in the cases where the element in question is not ritually harvested; for in such instances no further consecration is necessary, as the ritual harvest will have assured that the Green (the physical portion) and the Black (the spiritual portion) of the plant remain connected. 219"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Whenever the consecration of the plant elements obtained in any other manner than through the correct ritual harvest and interaction with the spirit of the plant is necessary, the Green Point of the Skull is to be employed, even if it is a tinctured portion of the essence of a plant that is required. In such cases the tincture is to be made inside a bottle, or jar, upon which the black candle for the central flame of the Green Point of the Skull is to be lit. The amount of the plant element introduced into the ink, paint, chalk or powder depends on the quantity of the mentioned carrier element, but the numbers 7, 9, 11 and 13 should be specially considered for such additions. When the signature is traced with empowered and enlinked chalk/ powder or paint/ink, it still needs a series of final quickenings before it can constitute as a fully open gate to its spirit. This final step in the full activation is achieved through establishing the elemental ladder through which the other four elements give way to the fifth, being the quintessential Black In Green, and it is done by the giving of suitable libation, smoke and fire. The elemental step of the Earth, seemingly omitted, is already established by the very planting (tracing) of the signature, as that physical manifestation of the spirit's imprint is by and through the earthly elemental step of coming into being. The signatures of the Black In Green could thus indeed be realised as the Seeds of the Spirits, to be sown (traced), watered (given libation), given air/wind (given breath and smoke) and light (flame of candle) to, so that the seed can germinate and the manifestation of the Spirit bloom, in ways very similar to how the germination of an ordinary plant seed depends upon water, oxygen, temperature and the light/ darkness. The signatures thus received from the spirit and activated by the exalted essence of the corpus of the plant in question become an activated point through which the spiritual current of the Black In Green called upon can flow to and fro and cause changes in accordance to its own nature and the ritually focused and expressed will of the caller. 220 WR..mted signatmw11 ... talismanic \\irtues .: • a �tnre ac:tivale6� • spirit that it � .... activated points .. � M att workings aud ...-plant belongin& .:1 �wooden fet:isbs_l iw ses, perfumes or .. lr ..ade consecrated, IIIII .... spirit. -� ·� Die plant elements so • • some other suitable • llii&Batures, which wit:JD. ...cagion, directly trall.t *ady sympathetica))y 11 \"'11us the signatures of • llf!rlfic plant -elements • �e obtainable m. a.B, one can here ohl.i 6e plant in question 311111 • the fundamental asped llle powers of these sigilli a muntless of different • work will become accellllii tile surface of this subjel tile blessed."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"I elements obtained in any illlal harvest and interaction 6e Green Point of the Skull .t portion of the essence of �tincture is to be made inside ..Jie for the central flame of � into the ink, paint, chalk It mentioned carrier element, I be specially considered for -.ered and enlinked chalk/ • of final quickenings before I' ils spirit.

Such activated points of contact can be employed within countless of different workings and are most often used to empower other portions of the plant belonging to the Black In Green in question, such as when wands, wooden fetishes or talismans, powders, oils, tinctures, potions, incenses, perfumes or any other plant-derived base for sorcery is to be made consecrated, blessed or cursed in conformity with the powers of the spirit. The plant elements so consecrated are placed upon, marked with or in some other suitable manner made to come into contact with the signatures, which within their activated forms will, by the way of contagion, directly transfer the power of the spirit into the elements already sympathetically connected to it. Thus the signatures of the Black In Green can be used for work with specific plant-elements and instead of the blessings and empowerments otherwise obtainable from the Master, through His Green Point of the Skull, one can here obtain the power required directly from spirit of the plant in question and engage in a more direct form of communion . If the fundamental aspects concerning the correct use, activation and the powers of these signatures of the plant spirits become understood, a countless of different possibilities for their employment within the work will become accessible, as we have here only lightly scratched the surface of this subject and will leave the rest to the cunning of the blessed. 221"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 <&tntrnl ®fftrings fnr t4t �lark 1Jn <&rttn During the workings in which we interact with and seek the aid of the Black In Green still attached to their living bodies, we must always pay for that which we need to harvest, or otherwise want accomplished by them, through different offerings and sacrifices. Besides the general offerings of different kinds of libations, candles, coins, tobacco, incense, bread and other food offerings, there are at times some additional and specific offerings which are needed depending on the Black In Green approached. The nature of the work within which the spirit of the plant is contacted and that of the plant spirit itself will determine the kind of more context-specific offerings required. For example will the offerings given in connection to the harvest of plant elements or the magical aid petitioned for during the rites of Love-Witching differ from the ones given during the rites of malediction, but in the same way may the offerings required for one and the same kind of work be different depending on the plant petitioned. A Rose may demand certain set of offerings in connection to amatory enchantments and a partially different set of offerings within the contexts of her sterner or more solemn workings. In order to be able to present the correct offerings within the correct context, one must be in a state of empathic rapport with the spirit of the plant in question, but such interaction still needs to be founded upon the tradition shaped by the ruling treaties governing these kinds 222 fill workings within the c.llJ Jllr-example, whenever hn.d p.n must be of a more � if Gilly leaves, flowers � lect:ion to the cu� Ill .., be a sacrifice of one's • il taken.

For example, whenever branches from trees are harvested, the offerings given must be of a more grand nature than what would be demanded if only leaves, flowers and/ or fruits would have been harvested. In connection to the cutting of living branches, there must most often also be a sacrifice of one's own blood in order to repay for that which is taken. Often the blood from one or more fingers of the left hand is drawn and smeared upon the cut part of the branch, which then is covered and sealed with a few drops of honey or, in some cases, wax. Such giving of one's own blood is not to be taken lightly and must be understood as the sealing of a lasting pact with the spirit of the plant in question and should be reserved for the more elevated, or the most important, workings. In certain cases when it is unwise to spill one's own blood, the blood of a suitable animal offering must be spilled instead, as in almost all cases when one of the more Martial or Saturnian plants are conjured in order to bring harm upon an enemy, or in such contexts where the location of the plant makes it unwise to spill one's own blood, such as when for example branches from trees growing within a cemetery are to be harvested from . Self-sacrifice is important when one humbly goes before the Famuli Guised In Green, but to attract other less worthy recipients of one's offering can turn the work into a meaningless and slow form of suicide. One must therefore thread carefully when it comes to giving of blood sacrifices to spirits within their natural surroundings, as such habitats often swarm with different kinds of shades and spirits. One must again let the spirits sought and one's own understanding concerning their nature and what they themselves communicate shape the sacrificial rites through which they become bound to champion one's cause; regardless if that cause is of a base and mundane or spiritual and lofty nature . Amongst the established covenants between the Cult and the Faithful 223"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Black In Green, there are a few sets of protocols of such level of importance that they must be adhered to even if sound judgment and spirit's guidance otherwise should shape such proceedings. The harvest of the wood of Blackthorn, Whitethorn and Elder always demands self-sacrifice and the spilling of one's own blood, this in connection to the other rites and offerings which must be performed and given during such harvests. The Blackthorn and Whitethorn demand drops of one's own blood whenever any part of them is to be harvested, as they call for red blood in return for the green blood drawn from them. But, if the harvest is aimed at the martial defence against, or Saturnian destruction of, someone else both of these trees will demand life offering of animals. When it comes to the Elder, tradition states that also she demands animal offering when her powers are to be turned against someone else, but when its wood is needed to be cut one must follow further protocol and again involve the spilling of one's own blood. During such rites one must bow low to the Elder tree, encircle it in prayer and ask the skeletal queen of the arboreal legions to grant her power through the hollowed and hallowed bones of her tree. One must then put a silver or gold ring on one of her branches, as if such branch would be her corpselike hand, or otherwise adorn it with some other kind of jewellery, kiss the branch and then water the root of the tree with a libation offering consisting of sweet red wine, into which 7 drops of one's own blood have been mixed. If no sign of rejection is at that point sensed and instead welcoming omens are perceived one may cut a living wand from her tree, bearing her full power within it through a lasting link to her mighty spirit. The reason for why this approach is specially outlined and emphasised here is that one of the main fetishes and magical tools of our Holy Lady Qalmana is such a properly harvested Elder Wand, which when hollowed out and loaded with rolled up copper scrolls bearing Her correct sigillae, soil bought in Her name from seven different cemeteries 224 and seven of Her key herbal � when sealed in both ends, aJ1111i Her signs of Necrosophic Saa Gulgaltha.

The Yew tree, on the other hand, receives animal offerings more gratefully than a few drops of one's own blood in all contexts, especially when that which is harvested is for the sake of Death, but when a personal wand is harvested from the spirit of Yew it is also customary to let a few drops from the left hand's middle finger fall upon the stub remaining from where the branch was cut. This bloodied stub is then sealed with the wax of a black candle, which then is left, in a secure manner, by the roots of the tree, together with the other more general offerings. These were just a few important approaches within our workings with the Black In Green and the wise will, based on that which is given, or hinted at throughout this book, be able to interact and communicate with the Spirits of the Green and through their faithful counsel attain further realisations and insights concerning their mysteries, all by the grace of the First Tiller. 225"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 ID4t 1Jnflutntts nf tltt <&tnilm 1Jlnri anb �ttnnbaru <ttaus.es nf Attribution Besides the attributes already presented for the different plants and their Black In Green, there are still some additional factors which can play in when it comes to some more special and context-specific powers that each individual plant may possess. These secondary causes of attribution are based on the influences of the Genius Loci and the general flow of power within the place where the plant is rooted. Crossroads, cemeteries, graves, forests, hills, mounds, seas, rivers, wells, fences, walls or other barriers, fields, meadows, the sides or the centres of roads, sites of accidents or places of violent crimes, bloodshed and murder can be given as a few examples of places that confer strong spiritual influences upon the plants rooted within or by their points of power, but also banks, casinos, police stations, prisons, courthouses, hospitals, market places or other such locations can, according to their energetic emanations, impress upon the sphere of influence of the plant growing in proximity to them. Crossroads confer for example the powers of liminality, path-opening and spirit summoning. Cemeteries and graves confer amongst other things the blessings and curses of spirits and shades of death and the dead.

Fences, walls and other similar barriers confer the power to protect, keep out and set boundaries, but sometimes also the ability to cross that which stands in the path and traverse to the other side. Fields and meadows confer the powers of abundance through work, good harvest and connect to still much more relevant and deep mysteries. Roads confer the powers of safe travel, success and direction, or the ability to block all such things, if for example a tree grows in the middle of, and blocks, such a road. Roads also connect to the flowing powers and spiritual currents of the land and its many different shades and spirits, depending on how it has been formed, the shape it takes, where it is suited and towards which direction it is headed . Sites of accidents, places of violent crimes, bloodshed and murder confer the powers of the Dark Dead and the spirits of Violent Death governing and working them and will often aid in the furthering of calamity and champion the cause of vengeance, torment and death. Banks and casinos confer the power to control money in different manners, grant luck and financial success and empower wealth­conjuring sorceries.

Marketplaces and other such places of commerce can grant the powers of communication, success in business and attract customers and clients. ��� Insight concerning a secondary foundation for any individual attribution of the powers of, for example, trees can also be based upon how they have interacted with and affected, and become affected by, their surroundings. For example can a tree pressing down upon another tree, with roots breaking through the ground and passing over, under or by the sides of a large stone or something else blocking its path, a tree with hollowed trunk leading downwards or upwards, with branches stretching or hanging over a path, with branches or roots dipping into the water of a river or some other source of water, with roots or branches breaking through any form of barrier, or a tree struck by lightning and still alive, or a dead tree still standing erect, all have specific attributes added to the general powers of their Black In Green. In similar fashion will the places upon which herbs and lesser plants grow and the forms they take because of their interaction with their environs influence their attributes and thus add or diminish aspects of their inherent spiritual powers. It is important to understand that all influences so caused by the mentioned factors still become filtered through and shaped by the original qualities of the spirit of the plant, before it can manifest and thus all such influences of the Genius Loci or other affecting conditions will in the end manifest in very diverse manners, all depending on the specific plant. 228 • is therefore not polllll )lll;mts just based on th111 Jllidme before arrivin&t.i llat the essence of the C 6e plant in questiOIL ll Te pin a true undeniiJJl 1.-i and to read the .iilll ... original attn�J llilllden aspects of the Wdl -'idl is mastered only til .-lad and commllDia!P llld Within the Greea.� � l"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"llfhealing and to the spirits llo to certain shades of the � can grant the powers � attract customers and lation for any individual IN!es can also be based upon .. and become affected by, lllll another tree, with roots Mer, under or by the sides Ia path, a tree with hollowed lilh branches stretching or IMs dipping into the water lr, �ith roots or branches :a tree struck by lightning � erect, all have specific t1heir Black In Green. lil:h herbs and lesser plants 6eir interaction with their 1111 add or diminish aspects llloences so caused by the lliuugh and shaped by the f. llefore it can manifest and •other affecting conditions illanners, all depending on It is therefore not possible to entirely generalise the attributes of plants just based on their place of growth, and one must see the whole picture before arriving to any relevant conclusion concerning the ways that the essence of the Genius Loci becomes brought forth through the plant in question.

Amongst our strongest plant allies one can find some of the heroic bringers of light, who from behind the green guises of their earthbound forms lend power and magic to those of the Holy and Fiery Bloodline of Qayin and Qalmana. Their presence within smaller plants and herbs is often understood as the Shadow Portion of their powers, while some of their very Spirits are believed to possess sovereignty over the collective power of the mightiest species amongst the Kingdom of Green. For instance, the Black In Green of all Blackthorns is understood by some to be the spirit of one of the most forceful Nefilim that after the deluge became caught in-between the worlds and seated within the Liminal Garden of Twilight. Similar ideas exist about the Genius of many other powerful plants and this explains certain taboos and rules of conduct which have been set within the workings of the Faithful Brethren.

If knives and sickles of steel are to be used as general harvesting tools the martial fire within them must first become quenched by, and tamed through, ritual ablutions in Venusian tinctures and infusions and other offerings of corresponding nature. Through such rites even the blades of Mars may be seduced to do the work of Venus. A silver needle reserved for drawing blood. Suitable tools for digging in the soil, prepared and consecrated in the names of the overseers of all our workings within both the Gardens of the Living and the Dead. Wooden spoons, suitable pieces of animal horn or human bone can be consecrated and used as ritual shovels dedicated to such workings of digging and uprooting. ii' Offerings for the plant host of the Famulus, such as coins, bread, candles, libation, cigar and any other gift known to be well received or demanded by the spirit in question. 232 • Protective and empllll the work at hand.

After a period of meditations, prayers, the giving of gifts and offerings, invocations and different forms of communication with the plant­spirit the actual ritual can commence. Armoured by the protective and empowering amulets and talismans seek out a worthy representative of the plant host of the Black In Green with which you seek to enter into the unifying covenant. Salute the spirit of the place and the Black In Green in the traditional manner by stamping your left foot three times and bowing towards the plant. State your intention and in the name of Qayin and Qalmana ask for permission to proceed with the ritual. If no negative signs are received you may proceed with the Work. 2. With the digging tool encircle the plant three times in a widdershins direction and by the Three Coronations of Qayin and His Bride conjure its Green and evoke its Black. From inside of this traced circle dig a hole close to the roots of the plant and with your left hand take seven handfuls of soil in the name of the First Tiller, Our Holy Master Qayin. Place the soil inside the bottle. 3. Bring out the parchment marked with the names and sigils and place it with the sigil of the Black In Green facing yourself by the plant, within the traced circle. Place to the sides of the parchment 7 copper coins, a black candle, a piece of unsalted sweet bread, a bottle of suitable libation, a cigar and any other more specific offering that you know the Dryadic Daemon of the plant enjoys, requests or demands. Light the black candle and pray to the Black In Green of the plant to come forth in the names of Qayin and Qalmana. Light the cigar in the name of Amiahzatan and blow its smoke towards the parchment while silently praying to the spirit of the plant. 4· When more than half of the cigar has been smoked you must place it upon the bread. Take then a sip from the libation offering and three times spray it, in a fine mist, over the parchment. Pour out the rest of the libation around the plant in the same way that you earlier had encircled it.

(It is important to remember that 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 are sacred numbers connected to these workings and that these numerical forms should whenever possible be reflected in the amount of the parts you harvest and sow into the fetish bottle.) Secure the lid of the bottle and shake it 49 times and thus symbolically sow the harvested elements from the plant into the soil kept within the bottle. Give praise to the Black In Green, bow, take three steps back, turn around and leave the location without looking back. 6. When back at home you must light the altar candles of the Master and invoke Him with the aid of the Formula of Calling and then call upon the Holy Blood-Mother in traditional manner and also light Her flames upon the altar and inside your own heart. Place the Green Point of the Skull, marked on the piece of silk, before the altar and awaken its powers in traditional manner with alcohol, smoke, the flames and the Formula of Qayin Qatsiyr. Place the bottle close to the centre of the Green Point of the Skull, in front of the burning black candle and open it. 7· For each part of the plant that you have placed within the bottle a corresponding part from your own body must also be given as sacrifice and placed inside the bottle in order to tie the links and strengthen the bonds between your own Self and the Dryadic Famulus. Amongst such sacrificially harvested 'mumia' are nail clippings, scraps of skin and flesh, strands of hair, teeth and bone, sweat, saliva, sexual fluids and blood . 235"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Close the bottle and shake it 49 times and envision a unification and synthesis between the harvested parts contained therein and focus upon the spiritual conjugation taking place through the strengthening of the golden chains of sympathy that connect you to the Dryadic Daemon. 8. Place the bottle once again upon the skull of the Green Point and open it anew. Light a cigar in the name of Amiahzatan and blow its smoke first 13 times over the central altar fetishes and then 7 times directly into the open bottle in order to strengthen the powers of the element kept therein. Place the remaining part of the cigar within an ashtray inside of the circle of the Green Point of the Skull. 9. Now that the parts of the plant and the parts from your own body have been sown into the bottle and bonded together you must water the 'seeds' that they now have become with white, black and red libations. The white libation can consist of strong white rum or vodka. The black libation must consist of strong unsweetened coffee and the red libation must consist of the spilled blood of a suitable animal offering favoured by the Dryadic Famulus. Let the first two libations be of an equal amount, filling up little more than 2/3 of the empty space that remains in the bottle and let the third libation of red comprise of every precious drop that streams from the slit throat of the chosen sacrifice. (In the same manner that the blood-essence is consumed by the attending Black In Green it is beneficial, when possible, if the flesh of the animal can be saved and later cooked and consumed by yourself, as such solemn sharing in the sanctified sacrifice would further solidify the bonds between you and the Dryadic Famulus.) The white, black and red libations represent life, death and rebirth, but also on a more concrete level serve to add power to the contents of the bottle, aid in the magical intermingling of the intimate elements linked to both you and the Dryadic Famulus and further aid in the empowering of the spiritual enlinkments.

Place then the brazier inside the circle, within the curved blade of the left lower sickle of the Green Point of the Skull, and burn some more incense in order to further empower all manifestations. 11. Place the half-red/half-green candle erect in the opening of the bottle. Light the candle in the name of Qayin and Qalmana and focused on its flame contemplate the mysteries and with the powers of mind, will and spirit realise it to be a physical manifestation of the intermingled essences of the Black In Green and the Black In Red. Through deep and slow breathing channel the powers of the Dryadic Famulus and then slowly let your inhalation and exhalation become faster until the mind is altered and ecstatic trance is entered. Commune with the Famulus on all levels possible and explore the essence of the Black In Green and seek to further penetrate, experience and understand its mysteries. Let your Soul leave the body if you can and interact with your Famulus unbound by the restrictions of your soil-born bodies. When all is done let the soul return and fall back into its shell of clay. Give praise to the Master and His Lovely Lady and extinguish all altar candles, but let all flames burning upon the Green Point of the Skull remain alight. 13. Make your bed upon the floor, with your head pointing towards the burning candles and try to enter the realm of dream with the names and shapes of the spirit signature of Dryadic Famulus held firmly within your mind. This aspect of the work can further open up the gates to the Gardens of the Other Side and, through the guidance 237"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"and protection of the now fully enlinked Dryadic Famulus, some of the most thorny paths that before were impossible to thread will now become possible to enter and explore. Upon awakening, and after all candles have burnt down fully, you must seal the bottle and keep it wrapped within a piece of emerald green silk. When you seek to work with your Dryadic Famulus it is not necessary to open the bottle, for in order to physically activate the link (i.e. the One Point of Sympathy and Unification) established within the bottle and rouse the Famulus, or assume its virtues, it is enough to shake the bottle seven times and call upon it in the name of Sancte Qayin and Sancta Qalmana. The offerings you will have to give to the Dryadic Famulus in order to reward, adore and strengthen it should in some ways be related to the different elements used during the initial ritual and thus aid in the fortifying of the links already established within the bottle. Before offerings are given you must always uncover the bottle, shake it seven times, place it before the altar, or before the living plant host of the Famulus, and encircle it thrice with a suitable wand or the middle and index finger of your left hand. The time of such offerings should harmonise with the nature of the Dryadic Famulus and its expressed wishes, but Mondays and Fridays are generally suitable for such rites of honouring and communion. 238 :� 1i iil}t i:n&oul � =-It • 1lidain the Cult of 0.1 .aa-formulas or tedlliit -.ful as the one pertailiJ 'Dis tincture can be .... 4 active veneration aDIIl111 � have been en� C e cration of the � lilbifer. � reason for why tile 1 � and cultinted 411 llwouling Tincture caa � Li 4es a fluid Point of­llle soul and the spirit 11 .,_..thy, in this case • willa His already seatl!ll4 'lllr Ensouled and � • a liquid carrier of � Whqed with His sacRIIl. ..-e. respect and dewllil � practical utilisam. -prominent ap� ..t talismans, like for� -sui Bone (Paye) T• f11i.t or chalk and aa.r41 tile Kaster's essence �"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"l Dryadic Famulus, some of !IIIIJOSSible to thread will now llave burnt down fully, you Ill within a piece of emerald �'JIDUI' Dryadic Famulus it is ...ler to physically activate -.1 Unification) established -., or assume its virtues, it is ..t call upon it in the name • Dryadic Famulus in order .W in some ways be related lie initial ritual and thus aid llllblished within the bottle. 1JS uncover the bottle, shake .-before the living plant host 11i1h a suitable wand or the ... .-ise with the nature of the -. but Mondays and Fridays llaaouring and communion. CHAPTER 17 ID4t iEnsnultng IDtncture nf <@autn Within the Cult of Our Holy Saint and Master Qayin there are few other formulas or techniques as important, powerful and practically useful as the one pertaining to the creation of His Ensouling Tincture. This tincture can be made first after a period of at least three years of active veneration and work with the Seated Essence of Qayin, which must have been enthroned according to the Ablution Ritual for the Consecration of the Altar Statue, as outlined within the First Book of Falxifer. The reason for why the essence of the Master must first have been seated and cultivated during a sufficient amount of time before the Ensouling Tincture can be created is because the tincture in question creates a fluid Point of Propagation and further Manifestation for both the soul and the spirit of the Master via the law of contagion and sympathy, in this case affected through the close proximity and contact with His already seated essence. The Ensouled and Ensouling Tincture of Qayin can best be described as a liquid carrier of the Master's presence and each drop of it is imbued with His sacred essence and therefore handled with utmost care, respect and devotion. The practical utilisations of this tincture are many, but amongst its most prominent applications are the consecration of other fetishes and talismans, like for example other altar statues and the immensely useful Bone (Paye) Talismans, but also the creation of Ensouled Ink, paint or chalk and any other form of enlinking to and charging with the Master's essence within the Telestic Rites. 239"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"To ritually wash cleansed statues or talismans with such tincture and just to let it soak into that which it is to consecrate is enough to cause full enlinkment and a seating of a portion of the manifested essence of the Master within them. Bone talismans are often placed in a jar and then covered with the Ensouling Tincture and given the suitable rites and offerings during a period of 31 nights in order to cause full ensoulment within them and make them into most powerful links to the soul and spirit of the Master. Each drawn insignia and spell written with ensouled chalk or ink, empowered by drops of such Ensouling Tincture, is instantly activated and working at the moment it is given form to and is wholly enspirited and charged by the Master's presence, transferred via the Holy Tincture. The creation of the Ensouling Tincture itself may be considered as a somewhat demanding process, but the way that the tincture later effectively and with ease is employed within the rites of ensoulment and consecration makes up for any arduous steps within the process, as it possesses the power to imbue with each of its drops the very Holiness of Our Sancte Qayin and is therefore invaluable. The following elements are needed for the creation of the Ensouling Tincture of Qayin: >I< general offerings to the Master >I< a piece of black cloth >I< a piece of white chalk cleansed with smoke of Rue and dedicated to Qayin >I< a wide brimmed circa 11f2 litre glass jar, with a flat and secure lid, of suitable shape and size so that the central Altar Fetish can safely be placed, in a standing position, on top of it >I< 4 large cigars >I< a box of matches >I< a bottle of liquor for the spraying of libation >I< 3 tablespoons of Yew leaves, plus 7 berries >I< 3 tablespoons of Cypress leaves, plus 7 young/green cones 240 • 3 tablespoons Gli plus 7 thorns_. • 3 tablespoons aQ • 3 tablespoons Glt • 3 tablespoons Glt • 3 tablespoons G( I • 2 tablespoons G(.1 • 2 tablespoons alii • 2 tablespoons af4 • 2 tablespoons of I • 2 tablespoons of I • 2 tablespoons af1 • 2 tablespoons an • 4 tablespoons of • the name of the II • 1 teaspoon of A1J • 1 teaspoon of ciall • a claw, skull or pi • 7 snake vertebrae, � • a live scorpion • 1 teaspoon of h­to the service of Ci • 7 circa smil (.0051 talismans, each cil inscribed \"'ith tM King of Gulgahla,. and Oreb Zaraq ill been kept unden�� 49 nights in ol\"da:!

Light a cigar in the name of Amiahzatan and direct seven exhalations of its smoke over the black cloth and additional seven times over the piece of white chalk.

These formulas are also to be understood as the herbal codes which can unlock the hidden force of each of the Key Sigils of Death and this becomes most obvious within the workings of Sanctified Inks. The essence of each formula, obtained through the method of tincturing, will possess the power to consecrate the ink into which its drops are added and gives it the ability to activate the Key Sigil to which it belongs.

To combine the ink, incense, oil, infusion, powder, tincture and sachet of each Key Sigil within one single ritual setting would create an immensely strong focusing and quickening of the powers connected to it and would cause impressive results.

When animal virtues are sought it is their blood, powdered bones and ashes which most often are mixed with the ink base meant to become so empowered, but even in such instances tincturing could be used in order to avoid lumps which otherwise could be caused by the coarser elements in the resulting ink.

Within the purely talismanic context they are consecrated via the seated essence of Sancte Qayin and then carried hidden upon the body in order to draw to one's self their indented virtues, but they can also be employed in connection to candle burning rituals during which they most often are marked with ensouled ink, paint or chalk upon a plate, on which the cleansed, inscribed, anointed and dressed candles are positioned. By placing the charged candle upon a plate bearing the talismanic seal corresponding with its ensorcelled purpose the powers of the candle will, via the heat of magical will manifested through flame, activate the full force of the seal and in union they will bring about the desired outcome.

These formulae are different from simpler ones, often consisting of one or just a few appropriate herbs burnt as general offerings, and hold within them the keys to certain less visible points of manifestation and power and as such it is not always the smell of their smoke which is of primary importance but it is instead the spiritual vibrations they cause and the aspects they attract which is their important attribute. Through the correct study of the specific plant elements that the formulae consist of and their specific combinations it becomes possible to conclude which of the aspects of the Master and the Lady there are that most potently can be manifested by the powers released and strengthened through the presented formulae and for which contexts and kinds of ritual workings they are best suited. A sufficient herbal knowledge and sympathetic rapport with the Black In Green will further aid in the correct combination of the different parts of each plant suggested in connection to some of the formulae, so that the final result becomes as much in harmony with the spiritual intent as possible.

The use of this tincture can be compared to the pouring of petrol upon burning ambers and if employed too often, or without sufficient understanding or temperance, it will sooner or later burn the hands of its misuser . The power of the tincture constitutes of the ability to accelerate fiery manifestations and arouse the Spirit Flame already seated, or enlinked to by the way of sympathy or the presence of His shade, within a Holy Fetish.

Such effigies are made in many different ways and from different materials and elements and are always meant to embody the target of the magical work whenever direct contact with the person in question is not possible or desirable. Such magical effigies can be the central point of focus within the rites of blessing, healing, love-witching, binding, manipulation and mind control, domination, empowerment, cursing and for whatever else that a direct link and physical representation of the target of the work is deemed as desirable and helpful for the successful casting of the spell. The historical origins of these kinds of effigies can be traced back to antiquity as they have, in one way or another, been employed within the magical traditions of almost all known cultures. At the root of this kind of sorcery foundations similar to those of the fetishistic arts can be found, as the keys to the creation of functioning effigies within these contexts are also based on the doctrines of occult sympathy and antipathy, astral enlinkment and the usage of the correct elements, such as those derived from the mineral, plant and animal kingdom, which through the correct rites are meant to strengthen the connections between the created image and that which it is meant to embody. 289"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Within some modern systems these kinds of effigies are believed to only serve as tools of mental concentration or as a mere symbolic representation of the target, without any actual magical powers of their own, but such ideas are not traditional or correct. An effigy used within an effective rite of sorcery should be made to be much more than just a mere symbol and must become an actual part of the target, through the rites of sympathetic magic and the correct use of elements, which according to the law of contagion hold within their parts actual and direct connections to the whole being of the target. In order for such enlinkment to become established in a focused and potent manner, transcending the mere connection that otherwise could be attained through a solely mental focus upon the target, the laws of sympathy and contagion must be adhered to and the power of the effigy and the physical links to the target that it is loaded with must become focused and strengthened through the correct rites and by the use of appropriate elements. There are three main key points to this process; the first point is the creation of a suitable image/effigy, the second point is to load the effigy with the personal links to the target and the third point is to ritually make the links which the created effigy carries and constitutes to one single strengthened, focused and fully enlivened Point of Connection. When it comes to the first point of the creation of a suitable body for the effigy it often comes down to the choosing of the most practically suited shape and form, fitting the specific sorcerous work in which it is meant to be employed. The material employed to create the body of the effigy must in other words suit the methods of ritual manipulation one has plotted to expose it to. Amongst the most often employed material bases for these effigies are cloth, wax, clay and wood, but also bone, roots, twigs, straws, fruits and even pieces of meat can within certain specific workings become carved, tied and hollowed out, or otherwise shaped, in order to assume the form of a suitable body.

As for the second point concerning the personal links to the target it is all about their degree of attachment caused by their former level of proximity and physical and etheric contact with the target. The most potent links are the ones that originate from the actual body of the target and therefore carry within them parts of his/her vital essence. Amongst such 'Bodily Mumia' (i.e. elements derived from the body serving as a medium for the transmission and manifestation of Life Force) are blood, spittle, sweat, sexual fluids, strands of hair, nail clippings, skin scrapings and teeth the most coveted within these rites, as such intimate elements contain strong imprints of, and enduring connections to, the whole being of the person they have belonged to. Because of the obvious difficulties with the obtaining of some of these kinds of links it can often be practical to use objects that have been in direct contact with such bodily mumia of the target, such as unwashed clothing, some favourite piece of personal jewellery, discarded cigarette butts and to a lesser extent the person's handwriting, which does hold some etheric and astral enlinkment because of the contact with the target's body, but also mental connection to the target, as the written word is the direct manifestation of the person's mental sphere of thought. All links to the target, such as the ones mentioned, are most often placed inside the hollow effigy and it is specifically into the solar plexus and head area of the effigy that such load most often is put, but for example when a figure candle is loaded also the base of the candle can be hollowed out and loaded with the linking elements. Besides the abovementioned personal links to the target other elements can also be used for the stuffing of the effigy, especially if it is one made out of cloth or created in any other hollowed form that would require further filling, both in order to assume the correct shape but also for the sake of strengthening the connections to the target and the influences with which one wants to afflict him/her. For example can an effigy created for the sake of healing become stuffed, or otherwise empowered by a powder made of plant elements possessing the powers of healing, or if the effigy is to be used for the destruction of an enemy 291"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"it can besides the personal links to the target become filled with cursing powders and grave soil bought from a suitable Dark Dead. The important thing is to remember that whatever you stuff the effigy with will penetrate into the very core of the target's being and cause physical, astral, mental and spiritual influences, all depending on the ritual consecration and the later treatment of the effigy. When it comes to the consecration and magical conjunction of the different elements and links in order to create a true embodiment of the target there are a few different ways that this can be accomplished. but we will now present a relatively simple but very effective Baptismal Rite for the final consecration of the effigy, which will strengthen all ties it possesses to the target, by the focusing and unification of all the powers of the elements employed in its creation. The following elements are used in order to create the Baptismal Water used for the consecration of an effigy: >F a Triangle of Manifestation, traced with a red paint empowered by the tinctures of Myrrh, Wormwood, Mugwort, Chamomile and Tobacco upon on a piece of black cloth >F a Rowan wand >F a terracotta bowl >F 3 red candles (each placed within a candleholder) >F soml water >F soml fresh milk >F 10ml tincture of Myrrh >F 10ml tincture of Mugwort >F 10ml tincture of Wormwood >F 10ml tincture of Chamomile >F 2 cigars >F a bottle of liquor >F a suitable animal offering >F a sharp knife 1.

Bring forth the chosen animal offering, pass it over the whole front side of your own body while intensively focusing on the intentions you have towards the target so that the animal absorbs some of the energetic emanations of your will and emotions and then cut its throat above the triangle so that its blood falls upon the effigy and into the terracotta bowl and say: I sacrifice this animal's blood and life in order to strengthen all the links to NN's body, mind and soul!

Light the second cigar in traditional manner and blow the smoke towards the effigy, while focusing your mind on the person it now embodies and feel the connections become even more fortified, focused and sealed within the effigy and see it becoming more and more animated with the essence of the target that it now channels vital forces from and has become a living part of.

If time and circumstance allows let the baptised effigy remain within the triangle until the three candles have been fully consumed, as that will in a very potent manner seal the enlinked and installed powers of the effigy, but if need be the effigy can also at this point be used in whichever way it is intended to be employed, as it now will hold enough focus for all general workings. 12. During the following night bring the animal and the remaining part of the baptismal water to a forest and there bury the animal by the roots of a suitable tree and pour the baptismal water over its grave. Place a white candle over the grave of the animal and place three coins so that they mark the three points of a triangle around the candle. Light the candle, give praise to the spirits of the place, in the name of the Master Qayin, and leave the area in the traditional manner, without looking back."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"If further elevation of the potency of this rite is sought you can add to the list of the tinctures poured into the baptismal water also those of the True Mandrake and Tobacco, in the same amount as the earlier mentioned tinctures. Also, whenever possible let the sex and the species of the animal chosen for the sacrifice within these rites of baptism be, on some relevant level, of a sympathetic nature in relation to the target and to the work itself. You could for example choose a dove for love-witching, a rat for the cursing of traitors, a snake for the conferring of cunning and blessings, a black hen or rooster for removal of unwanted influences and protection, a pig for the strongest workings commissioned to the dead, a bat for the bringing of nocturnal torment and sickness, a black cat for the bringing of death, a toad or a frog for the controlling of minds and a rabbit for general ensoulment and fortification of an effigy. But, whenever such considerations are not possible or practical, any animal of the same sex of the target can be used, and even if that choice is not available any animal will do, as its life force will still add the fortification and quickening sought from it. If the animal offering for some reason is not possible to give at all within this rite the powers of enlinkment will diminish considerably, but the ritual will still be able to aid in the focusing and strengthening of the sympathetic links between the target and the effigy so baptised. Another relevant consideration is the date chosen for the creation and baptism of the effigy, for if such date would overlap with the actual birthday of the target its powers of sympathy would become doubly strong. The phases of the moon should otherwise also be observed within these workings, as the astral tides and ties one seeks to manipulate and establish do wax and wane in accordance with her visible shape. 296 <;l CH IDl}tH ItvJ tJ � l The purpose of this ritual is II to death, in the name of tW1 of the Black In Green of 1M conducted you must first � according to the Laws and Ill wage of a corrupt accuser ill1 equalling the sentence that bel other.

CHAPTER 24 IDite 1-El�er' s <trurse hullanging The purpose of this ritual is to sentence a traitor or an oath breaker to death, in the name of the Holy Liluwa and by the severe powers of the Black In Green of the Elder tree. Before this ritual can be conducted you must first make sure that your ruling is a justified one, according to the Laws and Holy Tabus of the Cult of Qayin, for the wage of a corrupt accuser in the Court of Qalmana is a harsh one, equalling the sentence that he or she sought to place on an undeserving other. This curse is especially effective against those that have undermined the sanctity of the Bloodline of Qayin upon this earth through their falsity and lies and will be even more severe on those who have foolishly broken oaths, covenants and pacts that they have entered into in the Holy Names of the Rose-Crowned Queen. Let your rulings be just in these matters, without the blinding influences of the Adamic ego, and may the punishments fit all offences committed against that which is truly sacred. This ritual is to be executed during a Friday night, when the moon is in her dying phase, and the portion of the work that must be done by the Elder tree should ideally commence during the planetary hour of Saturn. The following elements are needed for this Work: � a puppet made out of black fabric � personal links to the offender � a sufficient amount of minced pork to stuff the puppet with � a one meter long black leather cord 297"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"� a piece of cleansed parchment � a quill pen made of the feather of a raven, crow or an owl � 7 black candles, each having Qalmana's Key Sigil of Punishment inscribed upon them with a Rose thorn � a box of matches � a suitable amount of incense consisting of powdered Elder wood, leaves and flowers, with the addition of powdered red Rose petals, Birch bark powder, Bloodroot powder and a pinch of sulphur � a brazier containing self-igniting charcoal � a piece of black ritual chalk, in beforehand consecrated in the name of Qalmana � 13 copper coins contained in a black drawstring pouch � a bottle of Elder Flower Wine � a silver ring � a loaf of unsalted bread � a large cigar � a suitable black animal, such as a hen, a rabbit or in some cases even a large rat � a sharp knife � a small shovel for the burial of the animal offering 1. Knock thrice upon the altar, chant seven times Qalmana's Formula of Calling and then light Her altar candle. Burn some Rose incense for Her and then present your case to Her and ask for Her judgment concerning the traitor or oath breaker upon whom you seek to call done Her punishments. Tell the Holy Mother what you seek to accomplish and explain to Her why you have judged that the offender deserves death. Request from the Rose-Crowned Queen a sign of Her disapproval in case the sentencing is unjust in Her eyes and if no such signs are received understand Her answer to be an approving one. If you are sufficient in the use of any suitable form of divination you may at this point also use the system in question for the attainment of Her answer, but most often it is best to let natural omens and signs, such as the flickering of candles, the forms assumed by the smoke and intuition become the voice through which Her will is made known to you. 298 .._.lusion will in this contelll --*e sure to be honest and opi 4;mswers. � •.., disapproving signs or odilli ...,. proceed with the work, .. � you must revalue your,. -..lion of this work, on tbanll --e-a ning the matter and �1 ·· 'IIIIR presenting the same c:alllllll the harsh judgment still till �, •-pattern becomes cr 5 I of Her central flame. � i ;·i1 r· a black candle with tiel Key Sigil of Punishment tri 'EIIi::.m spine or a Rose tllllll .... lw.e horizontally the name• .a.dle with mineral oil� Jr.e, while focusing on ,... 7 a 4 punishments of Qat.�� -�and away from Jill thns directing the castill R Ills-Let your focused Wil � anenoming the arrowdl Ill the heart of the taiJII!I I s F!J in Her rnarksina.nsbii1 .. .j tile candle in a suitable t!liflll I ' diction and place it up���; •• r1er. light the candle ia1"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"r of a raven, crow or an owl �a's Key Sigil of • \"\";th a Rose thorn ' .

Self-delusion will in this context bring doom upon your own head, so make sure to be honest and open-minded while seeking these kinds of answers. If no disapproving signs or other forms of answers are received you may proceed with the work, but if the Holy Qalmana rejects your ruling you must revalue your judgment and not go through with the execution of this work, on that night, and wait for further clarification concerning the matter and you must wait at least a full lunar cycle before presenting the same case to Her again, if you at that time feel that the harsh judgment still feels justified. 2. If the Mistress of the Sickle approves your sentencing you must write the name of the accused seven times upon a piece of paper and then turn the paper 90 degrees anti-clockwise and seven times write Qalmana's Key Sigil of Punishment over the offender's name, so that a cross pattern becomes created. Place the paper upon the altar, in front of Her central flame. Cleanse a black candle with the Tincture of Green Fire and inscribe Her Key Sigil of Punishment vertically upon it with a rusty nail, a Hawthorn spine or a Rose thorn. On the lowest part of the candle inscribe horizontally the name of the traitor I oath breaker and dress the candle with mineral oil containing the essences of Hawthorn, Elder and Rose, while focusing on your will to afflict the offender with the harshest punishments of Qalmana. Hold the candle with its wick towards yourself and anoint it with the oil downwards and away from yourself, towards the target's inscribed name, thus directing the castigating currents of Qalmana towards him/her. Let your focused Will and vindicated wrath become the lethal poison envenoming the arrow that you through the powers of Qalmana direct at the heart of the target and put your trust completely and faithfully in Her marksmanship. Place the candle in a suitable candleholder reserved for the workings of malediction and place it upon the paper marked with the name of the offender. Light the candle in the name of Liluwa of the Reddened 299"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Sickle and pray for Her guidance, protection and aid in the punishing of the traitor. 3. Cut the outlines of the black cloth puppet, sew together the two halves with black thread and leave an opening through which it can be filled. Stuff the puppet with the minced pork and insert into the ground meat all the personal links to the target and then finish it by sewing up the opening used for stuffing. Proceed with the rites of 'Enlinkment of Sympathetic Effigies', according to the instructions provided earlier in this book and when the puppet is fully connected to the sentenced offender wrap it in a black shroud. 4. Adorn yourself with the black and green rosary of Qalmana and any other empowering and protective talismans and amulets of Qalmana that you possess and burn some additional incense to Her glory. Give praise to the Holy Mother in traditional manner and then extinguish the altar candles, but let the black candle placed upon the name of the offender remain burning. This candle will burn while you perform the rest of the ritual and will aid in the channelling of Her wrathful emanations towards the target. This candle may also reveal certain omens concerning the outcome of the work once you have returned back home or it may show some signs through its molten wax when it has burnt down completely, in either case it will act as a manifestation of your sentencing of the offender upon the altar. s.

The sigil itself does not possess the power to animate (i.e. bestow Anima) anything on its own, but it does direct and seal forces possessing such abilities, when and where they are presented, in order to empower an effigy and grant it the powers and abilities to hear, to see, to smell, to talk, to eat, to take, to give, to feel, to leave, to return, to grow stronger and most importantly to remain bound to its purpose. The Spirit Effigy Animation Sigil is not to be used for the consecration of any effigies representing already living persons and is solely reserved for the animation of the bodies of the discarnate souls and spirits and as such it may even be used for the consecration of effigies holding the shadows of the dead, employed within certain forms ofNecrosophic Sorcery in which the souls of the departed are kept and bound to serve the living.

Such a homunculus is an actual part of yourself that has ritually been separated from your whole and become focused and fortified only to serve the cause of martial defence. In order for this divided aspect of your own essence to remain potent and serve its purpose you must take care of it and grant it different kinds of nourishments and fortifications, so that its links to yourself persist, while at the same time remaining separate from your full being to be able to function the way it is intended. Such shielding homunculus is linked to you through the powers of personal and sympathetic links, but also through the power of Spirit, Will, Imagination and Faith. In addition, the empowerments of thirteen Black In Green are required within the creation of the twin-homunculus and elements from their plants must be used in order to fortify and seal the Work. We will here give instructions for the making of a leather puppet to serve as the body of the shielding homunculus, but such effigy can also be made out of other suitable materials, such as clay or wood, as long as it is formed properly in order to be able to hold the elements with which it must be filled.

The way this work is conducted within the setting of our Necrosophic Sorcery it does not only return the poison that had been directed towards the faithful by the wretched but also, through the sorcerous might of the Black In Green and the power of the seated essence of Sancte Qayin, amplifies its venomousness while doing so, in order to also wreak a sevenfold retaliation against those who would attack the blessed bearers of His Mark. This ritual is only to be conducted when there are no doubts about the fact that one is under some kind of occult assault, which is something that must have been concluded through the wise counsel of the Master, the Lady and/or the good famuli warding the Bloodline and the Path through which it flows.

Light a cigar in the traditional manner and with its smoke add power to your conjurations by placing the burning foot of the cigar in your mouth and blowing its fiery smoke out of its head end, from under the top of the candle and down towards the glass beneath it.

Pray to Him and ask for His blessings, protection and empowerments and let Him know why you seek to bring destruction upon the target. 2. Pick up the black figure candle and pour a little bit of liquor over it in order to wash and cleanse it and then light the cigarillo in the name of Amiahzatan and say: By the breath of Amiahzatan I exorcise you, 0 creature of wax, and make you void and ready to receive the enlinkment to NN, who you shall embody and act as a direct link to! 338 ! .-ow the smoke of ... .d thus make it pad tile sympathetic e� I 3-Carve with the niiiiJP. .t the figure candle ..

Carve with the rusty nail the full name of the target on the chest of the figure candle and on the back of it carve vertically the Master's Key Sigil of Bane. Hollow out the space underneath the feet of the figure candle and insert therein the links to the target or his/her folded name paper. Seal the links with the aid of the black wax that you had carved out and carefully heat the base of the candle and make it flat and as smooth as it was before the loading of the personal links. For the most potent result you may here proceed with the full rite of 'Enlinkment of Sympathetic Effigies', but if time and circumstances do not allow that full rite just initiate a focused contemplation in which you mentally project and install the image of the actual target into the black figure candle and thus strengthen the links and establish further mental connections between the figure candle and the enemy. 4. Open and place the jar containing the cemetery soil upon the altar. Place the black and white rosaries around it on the altar so that they both encircle it and empower and direct the shades kept therein. Pour into the jar the Cinnabar, Chilli powder, Iron Oxide and the gunpowder and with the small Blackthorn or Ebony wand stir the contents of the jar and pray over it, in the name of the Lord of the Shadow of Death and the King of Gulgaltha, to bring merciless pain, fear, madness, misery and destruction upon your enemy. 5. Anoint the enlinked figure candle from head to toe with the Cursing Oil and transfer your deadly hatred into his/her body through the maleficent powers of the oil with which he/she is smeared. 6. Place the figure candle in a standing position inside the black jar of the Dark Dead and the accelerating, agitating, burning and volatile elements with which they have been fortified.

There are many different kinds of vinegar and each of them confers to the tincture made with their own special qualities and powers, for example White Alcohol Vinegar is perfect for the stronger rites of purification, for the breaking of curses and the undoing of spells.

Holy Water made in the manner here presented can serve many purposes and will most often be utilised within the rites of aspersion, baptism, consecration and ablution where the conferring of the Master's powers charged into the water is to be bestowed upon that which it is used upon. The following elements are needed for the making of the Holy Water: � a Bone Paye talisman � a terracotta bowl (with a fitting flat lid) � clean well or spring water � a cigar � liquor � a small candle (colour depending on the specific attribute you want the water to receive) � red Carnation petals (or other plant element with attributes corresponding with the specific virtues sought) 1. Place the Paye inside the terracotta bowl. Recite over the bowl seven times the Formula of Calling corresponding to the aspect of the Master whose blessings and powers you want to access.

If the Holy Water is needed urgently you must at this point pray over the water and ask the Master, Our Good Saint of Sinistral Death, to grant His complete empowerments and then turn the candle upside­down and extinguish its flame into the water, thus giving its fiery essence to it.

When the candle has burnt out the Holy Water will be ready for use. At this point the Paye can be taken out from the bowl and placed back upon the altar. If the Holy Water so created is to be used at a later time it is good if it is filtered, poured into a tinted bottle with the addition of 1/5 of Vodka, over which you have prayed.

Red is most often used for the workings of fiery passions, but also for quickening, martial protection and victory.

Even though all of these plants separately are potent allies of our Work they become even stronger when they are unified by the way of tincturing, as their extracted essences when conjoined create a triple-flamed spiritual fire, with powers to eliminate all unwanted influences and establish purity. For the making of this tincture an equal amount of enspirited and dried leaves of each plant is powdered, mixed and placed inside of a green tinted 700cl glass bottle, with a fitting metal screw cap, so that 2/5 of the bottle becomes filled. The bottle is then filled with strong vodka, leaving enough room so that by its shaking the plant elements can be mixed, in order to so assist the extraction and conjunction of their essences. The bottle's cap is screwed on and it is shaken 49 times and the spirits of Rue, Sage and Yerba Mate are prayed to and asked to lend their cleansing and protective powers. The Green Point of the Skull is then planted and activated in the traditional manner, with the bottle placed at the centre, with the black candle positioned carefully upon its flat metal cap.

The potency of this talisman has been tested and proven and while being a relatively simple magical construction it holds immense power and grants a shielding halo deflecting the attention of meddlesome individuals and confuses those who would prosecute the faithful followers of the Good Saint of Outlaws, Qayin, the Once Cursed and Seven Times Blessed. The following elements are needed for the assembling of the talisman: ii< 1 walnut ii< 7 dried Rowan berries ii< 7 small pieces of Devil's Shoestring Root ii< Oregano herb ii< Fennel Seeds ii< Black Mustard seeds ii< Celandine herb ii< sulphur powder ii< a small piece of paper which has been cleansed and blessed for the work ii< sanctified black ink, empowered by a tincture bearing the essences of the same seven elements which are to be employed inside the walnut talisman ii< a quill pen 355"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"'14 a big cigar '14 a black candle '14 a copper nail '14 matches '14 liquor '14 mineral oil '14 strong glue 1. Initiate the ritual in a traditional manner and serve Sancte Qayin His general offerings. Direct a prayer to the Master, in His aspects as the Saint of Killers and the Exiled Protector of the Outlaws, pertaining to the work at hand and explain to Him that you need His blessings in the form of His protection against the 'lackeys of the law' and ask Him to make you invisible in their eyes and minds and to confuse, blind, mislead, obstruct, disgrace, conquer and banish them all. 2. Crack open the walnut in such a way that you get two whole, perfect, halves and remove the nut meat (make sure to have several walnuts, for sometimes one must go through many before getting two perfect halves). Place the two walnut shells side by side on the altar, with the empty sides up, so that they become two talismanic vessels that you, in the name of the Master Qayin, shall fill with the required elements and powers. 3· Place all the herbal elements, which in beforehand should have been empowered and enspirited through the Green Point of the Skull, in fitting containers upon, or in front of, the altar and quicken their powers by spraying liquor over them, while at the same time mentally praying to their Black In Green to fully awaken and lend their blessings to your work. Light then the cigar in the name of Amiahzatan and repeat the same process as you did with the liquor, and focus the power of your will, through the smoke, towards every herbal element, arousing their spirits and conjuring them to the task at hand. 356 4-Take the small piece of 1 the Master's Nigromancy • sigil write three times wi1ll Blow tobacco smoke over till protect you and to make ,­of the law.

Blow tobacco smoke over the sigil and pray to the Master to hide you, protect you and to make you invisible in the blinded eyes and minds of the law. When the ink has dried turn the piece of paper and on its other side draw the 'Blind the Law Sigil', which is reserved solely for these kinds of workings against the lackeys of the law (e.g. policemen, judges, prosecutors, tax collectors, lawyers etc.). Blind the Law Sigil Blow tobacco smoke upon the 'Blind the Law Sigil' in order to activate it, and focus on how the emanations of the Nigromancy Sigil, marked on the other side of the paper, filters through it and charges it with the powers of the First Saint of All Outlaws, Our Master Qayin. Leave the talisman paper on the altar to dry. s. Place the 7 dried Rowan berries in one of the empty walnut shell halves, blow tobacco smoke over them and in the name of Qayin pray for the protection of the Rowan's mighty daemon . Place then the 7 pieces of the Devil' s Shoestring Root (each circa smm 357"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"long) in the same shell half, blow smoke over them and pray to the root's spirit to tie the feet of all the lackeys of the law and to prevent them from investigating, pursuing or in any other way bothering you. Add to the contents of the shell a pinch of Oregano, blow smoke over it and ask its spirit to repel all servants of the law and to turn their steps away from you. 6. Fold now the paper marked with the sigils away from yourself as many times as possible, since the intention is to direct outwards the blinding influences. Place the folded talismanic paper in the same shell half that you have filled with the other elements and blow tobacco smoke over it, while asking the Master to blind the enemy and make you invisible in their eyes and minds. 7· Place a small pinch of sulphur in the other, still empty, half of the walnut shell and blow tobacco smoke over it, asking its elemental spirit to burn, punish and banish all the lackeys of the law. Place a pinch of Fennel Seeds over the sulphur, give them smoke and ask them to keep away all the lackeys of the law and lead them astray. Add a pinch of Celandine powder to the contents of the walnut shell, blow smoke over it and pray that it grants you aid in escaping the clutches of the law. Finally add a pinch of Black Mustard Seeds upon the Celandine, give them tobacco smoke and ask them to confuse and blind all lackeys of the law. 8. Cleanse the black candle and inscribe both the Blinding the Law Sigil and the Master's Nigromancy Sigil upon it, with the help of the copper nail. Anoint the candle with a scentless mineral oil and then dress it with a blend consisting of all the seven different elements with which you filled the two halves of the walnut shell.

Push down with your left hand's thumb upon the still warm wax so that the sealing becomes as smooth and as even as possible, and make sure that the wax does not cover the inner edges of the walnut shells. Place then the candle in a candleholder and let it burn upon the altar . 10. Apply the glue to both sides of the inner edges of the two walnut shells, and carefully and precisely close them by pressing them together. The end result should on the surface look just like a normal walnut and one should not be able to see that it was ever opened. Blow now tobacco smoke on the now charged and sealed talisman and chant 21 times: Confuse, blind, mislead, obstruct, disgrace, conquer and banish all the lackeys of the law and make me invisible in their eyes and minds! 11. Place the talisman close to the dressed and burning black candle upon the altar, praise the Master and close the work in a traditional manner, but let the black candle burn down as an offering to the spirit of the talisman. The talisman can then be placed in a small black pouch and carried in the left pocket. In order to keep this talisman strong and its magical charge alive you must, with the help of a mineral oil base and the same kinds of elements that were used to fill the walnut shells, create an ensorcelled oil, with which you have to anoint and feed the talisman every Monday night. 359"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Every time the talisman is anointed with this oil, you have to chant 7 times: Sancte Qayin, Obscurentur Oculi Eorum ne Videant!

After the 49 nights of shaking and praying over the jar it will be ready for use within all rites of anointment. The oil can at this point be filtered or be kept as is and it will possess immense powers when it comes to all sorceries aimed against the law, and has in such contexts proven to be a mighty conqueror of those who would imprison and otherwise punish the antinomian. 363"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 Witt �rtattr fnrijantmtnt anb �tal fnr tltt i'linbing nf tl}t &w The following ritual is another means through which the lawless may gain invisibility in the eyes and minds of the enforcers of the law and escape their tyranny. In a world governed by Archonic decrees meant to crush the Spirit and bind the strong, it is sometimes necessary to employ sorcery in order to retain one's freedom and accomplish that which needs to be done. In contrast to the Walnut Talisman Against the Law already presented, this ritual serves more directly and aggressively to obscure the sight and mind of any and all servants of the Demiurge who in the name of the laws of man would suppress the free will of the blessed ones of Awakened Spirit.

Included in this category are all those that have possessed an Awakened Spirit and who through death have reached liberation from the dungeons of the Demiurge and traversed the pathways leading to the Other Side, or in other ways managed to escape the cyclical hell of hylic rebirth. There are those amongst these dead that have taken seat within the points in-between the world of the Archons and the realms of the Black Light, and as such they have become liminal entities venerated as gods, demons or saints, depending on the context and the traditions in and through which they have been contacted and experienced. However they are perceived and understood by others they remain to us still as respected ancestors, connected to our own Inner Divine Sparks by the bonds of the Serpent Seeded Spirit-Flame. Within the context of esoteric work with the Mighty Dead, the 12 names of the Line of Cain mentioned in Scripture, plus the secret Holy Name of Qalmana obtained from apocryphal sources, making 13 names all in all, have become a formulaic point of enlinkment between us and all those known and unknown Mighty Dead. These names represent the Seven Generations of Qayin before the flood and are the following: Qayin, Qalmana, Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methusael, Lamech, Addah, Zillah, Jabal, Jubal, Tubal-Qayin and Naamah. 385"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Out of these thirteen there are two who are believed to not have directly belonged to the bloodline of Sataninsam, and are instead thought to have been wedded into it, these two being Addah and Zillah, the mothers of Jabal and Jubal and Tubal Qayin and Naamah. Who these two mysterious women were, where they came from and why they were receptive for the Spirit-Blood is a mystery left for contemplation, but it is sufficient to say that they did serve the impulses of the Spirit Awakened and the Black Light of the Other Side, as they gave birth to some of the most important, powerful and enspirited amongst our Holy Ancestors. These Thirteen Mighty Dead represent all those named and unnamed belonging to the Awakened Ones of the Spirit, from both before and after the flood, and occupy, within the context of Necrosophic Sorcery, the Thrones of Skulls and Bones holding dominion over all the Faithful Dead and commanding power over all the spiritless dead of the bloodlines of the profane. These thirteen, eleven of which being placed beneath the two exalted thrones of Qayin and Qalmana, before whom they all kneel, become the points of egress for the Spirit's Deathly Ascent and the overshadowing forces ruling all the dead. The Thirteen-Star of the Gate of the Dead, placed upon the altar of their veneration, and the thirteen parts of Qayin's Seventh Key Sigil of Death are all connected to these mysteries, with the souls of these Mighty Ones being enlinked to their thirteen points and thirteen parts, establishing through them the outer connections to their Spirits, residing on the Other Side.

Here is a mystery for contemplation, as many secrets have been concealed within the visible forms of myth. ���I.HI.���� Exoteric sources can shed little light on the mysteries connected to these Mighty Dead of Qayin and Qalmana's bloodline, but apocryphal and esoteric traditions, both old and new, will be able to provide a few seeds of gnosis which, if sown and watered properly, may through the Grace of the Mighty Ones germinate and bring about Revelation. It is up to each of the faithful to seek the mysteries, from both spiritual and material sources, in order to open up the paths enabling the shining forth of the Light of the Dead, but we will here provide two examples of some small, but visible, pieces of the puzzle. In connection to Zillah we offer the following quotation from The Book of Jasher: \"For in those days the sons of men began to trespass against God, and to transgress the commandments which he had commanded to Adam, to be fruitful and multiply in the earth. And some of the sons of men caused their wives to drink a draught that would render them barren, in order that they might retain their figures and whereby their beautiful appearance might not fade. And when the sons of men caused some of their wives to drink, Zillah drank with them and the child-bearing women appeared abominable in the sight of their husbands, as widows,for to the barren ones only they were attached. And in the end of days and years, when Zillah became old, the Lord 388 opened her womb.

And she conceived again and bare a daughter, and she called her name Naamah,Jor she said, After I had withered away have I obtained pleasure and delight.\" The relevant aspects lie as usual hidden within the scriptures of the profane, as for every word written in order to hide the truth an echo of it, even if it be very silent, will ring out its concealed verity to those who by the Spirit can hear. In this case there are mysteries here connecting Zillah to the darker lunar mysteries of Lilith and in her proclamation of having obtained a child from \"the almighty god\" we can see a clear reflection of Eve's statement when she had acquired Qayin. Here lies the beginning of mysteries worthy of contemplation. As for the second example, in connection to the more modern, but lesser known, lore attributed to that which has been labelled as freemasonry, we can find one interesting text named \"The Legend of the Temple\" as published by Charles W. Heckethorn, in his book about Secret Societies. The following is a short quotation from that text: \"Enoch, a son of Cain, taught men to hew stones, construct edifices and form civil societies. Irad and Mehujael, his son and grandson, set boundaries to the waters and fashioned cedars into beams . Methusael, another of his descendants, invented the sacred characters, the books of Tau and the symbolic T, by which the workers descended from the genii of fire recognized each other. Lamech, whose prophesies are inexplicable to the profane, was the father of Jabal, who first taught men how to dress camels' skins; of Jubal, who discovered the harp; of Naamah, who discovered the arts 389"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"of spinning and weaving; of Tubal-Cain, who first constructed a furnace, worked in metals, and dug subterranean caves in the mountains to save his race during the deluge; but it perished nevertheless, and only Tubal-Cain and his son, the sole survivors of the glorious and gigantic family, came out alive.\" The quoted text is remarkable in more ways than one and should be studied in its entirety, not for the sake of it being an ancient or historically authentic document, but because it is a clear example of 'inspired writing' and in essence harmonious, in many ways, with our own Traditional Gnosis, especially because of its unusually strong anti-Demiurgic and pro-Luciferian stance. The statement about the survival of Tubal-Qayin and his unnamed son should be considered in the light of our own gnosis, as presented in the 'Apocryphal Revelations of the Qayinite Genesis' chapter of this book. It must here be made clear that value given to the writings of those not standing within the Circle of the Faithful must never be overestimated, even if they sometimes may provide forms and structures through which Spirit can communicate its Alogos, and that true insight in the end only can be attained through practice and actual communion with the unseen, as our work is not that of archaeology or mundane history, and is instead mystical and spiritual in both approach and intention. It is therefore more rewarding to seek the spiritual reality of myths via spiritual routes, instead of solely look to the writings of others for the disclosing of that which only can be revealed by the interaction between the living and the dead. Let the Altar of the Mighty Dead therefore become the desk in front of which their mysteries are studied and contemplated, and in time let experience be your primary teacher in these matters. 390 . ! 4 Jrnu.er fort ,, • ·� , In remembrance of the • Spirits of the Faithful bolla.� grant to them your Erulllll from beyond the cosmic ,_ to you, Eternal Bliss, and d 0 Eternal Divinity, you mill creation, I pray to you to. 4 children, the shadowless rl that we all, who are follsl who have already achieva steps of the Cross and asc8l Skull, and thus one day atllli Ones now free from the sii l .1 I praise you, Alien Div04 blessings already bestowaf1 ; deeds I continually give laJ become, like them, fit to e Spirit attain union with all' I pray to you, 0 Mighty • those who in life and throtiJ ever keep them on Your Pal even beyond that glorious� they now reside, so that • and Endless Power and Gla"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"IQiin, who first constructed a • subterranean caves in the ' the deluge; but it perished If llis son, the sole survivors of It Gilt alive.\" t\" � ways than one and should be IKe of it being an ancient or lla:ause it is a clear example of .-ious, in many ways, with our ���Cause of its unusually strong -=e. !JW,al-Qayin and his unnamed rl our own gnosis, as presented III!Jinite Genesis' chapter of this •liven to the writings of those iDe Faithful must never be ;.a may provide forms and -.unicate its Alogos, and that t.uned through practice and !1J as our work is not that of ill instead mystical and spiritual • the spiritual reality of myths pill to the writings of others for rile revealed by the interaction p:: llfore become the desk in front ..-.1 contemplated, and in time • in these matters.

CHAPTER 48 The Rosarium of the Mighty Dead is a powerful talisman connected to the Shades and Spirits of the Blessed Ancestors of the Qayinite Bloodline. It possesses the power to strengthen all forms of interaction with them and calls upon their blessings, guidance and empowerments. This rosary talisman is connected to the Named Ones of the Line of Qayin and Qalmana and is a link to the thirteen keys, gates and thrones belonging to each of them. The Rosarium of the Mighty Dead can also be employed as a powerful talisman and an amulet to be placed around the neck during the Workings of Gulgaltha, as it lends both the protection and authority of those Elevated Dead that it is linked to and assists in the commanding and controlling of the lesser ghosts of those belonging to the day-born bloodline of Adam. The rosary in question consists of 130 beads all in all; 13x7 black onyx (or Gabon Ebony) beads 13x2 quartz crystal beads 13 bone or scrolled/rolled up copper beads, each bearing the mark of one of the thirteen Soul Signatures of the Seventh Key Sigil of Qayin If the thirteen marked beads are to be made of bone it is ideal to use human bones, but if consecrated properly via the ensouling powers of the soils of Gulgaltha, even animal bones may be used. In certain cases hollow ceramic skull beads marked with the thirteen signs and loaded with the powdered bones of a Faithful Dead, or the mixed soils of seven cemetery crossroads, can also be employed. 395"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"If these beads are to be made of copper, very thin sheets of pure copper must first be cut into rectangular shapes, circa 3cm in length and 2cm in width, which then are inscribed with one of the thirteen signs of the Seventh Key Sigil of Death and rolled up tightly into a small scroll shaped copper bead. Each of these marked beads are to be blessed in the name and upon the sign of each of the named ancestors of the Qayinite bloodline, by being placed on their corresponding part of the Thirteen Pointed Star of the Gate of the Dead. There they must remain and gain the Blessings of the Mighty Dead for at least seven weeks, before they can be incorporated into the rosary, and it is during this period that they will gain their primary enlinkments to the powers of the ones represented by and accessed through the thirteen signatures marking the points of that star. The sequence in which the beads are to be strung, before their consecration via ablution and fumigation, is the following: a quartz bead is followed by seven onyx beads, an additional quartz bead and then a marked bone or copper bead. This sequence is repeated until all beads are strung. The correct order in which the marked beads are strung is of importance here and they must be threaded in the following reversed order: Naamah, Tubal-Qayin, Jubal, Jabal, Zillah, Addah, Lamech, Methusael, Mehujael, Irad, Enoch, Qalmana and Qayin. By stringing the marked beads in this reversed order of the line of descent the end resulting rosary will become correctly shaped and the marked beads will correspond with the visible Gate of the Dead sigil encircled by the thirteen Soul Signatures of the Mighty Dead. The loose ends of the rosary are to be tied by thirteen knots, each sealed in the name of one of the Holy Antecessors, here starting with Qayin and ending with Naamah.

Each Black In Green of the thirteen trees contained in the tincture must during these 31 nights be entreated properly and asked to grant their relevant blessings and empowerments, in order to open up the paths and the gates for the Mighty Dead and aid in the enlinking of the rosary to their lingering souls and Blessed Spirits. When the tinctured essence of the thirteen trees has so been obtained the consecration ritual itself can commence on a following Monday night, in connection to the traditional workings with the Mighty Dead. 1. Remove the piece of quartz crystal normally kept inside the central water glass of the Mighty Dead and place it inside a cleansed and dedicated terracotta, or glass, bowl. Place the bowl upon the Gate of the Dead altar disk, so that it replaces the usual cup of water. Fill 3/5 of the bowl with Holy Water, that in beforehand has been created via the traditional ritual employing the power of the Master's bone talisman. Mix into the sanctified water the prepared tincture of the thirteen Black In Green, so that 2/5 of the liquid contained in the bowl consists of it. 2. Call upon the dead in the traditional manner, light the three altar candles and serve them the traditional offerings meant to nourish their astral links to this world, constituting of their enduring souls. Via the smoke of their tobacco offering direct your prayers to each of them individually and ask them each to confer their blessings and empowerments through their crystal, into the contents of the bowl placed upon their Gate Sigil and by the powers of the thirteen Black In Green, that have lent their fortifications to the Holy Water, manifest their spiritual light and fully consecrate the rosary that you intend to 397"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"wash and soak in it. 3.

When feeling the spiritual charge within the contents of the bowl and the rosary washed and consecrated therein reach its peak, place the rosary spiralled around the quartz crystal and let it there remain, soaking in the evoked essences of the thirteen Black In Green and the thirteen Mighty Dead. 4.

Abel who was the first man to be killed and buried, by the hands of our Master Qayin, is in death made sacred and faithful to the cause of his own murderer and a servant to those of the bloodline of his own subduer. As Abel was cut down by Qayin and buried within the crossroads of the Field of Blood the first cemetery and intersection between the chthonic realm of the dead and the world of the living became created and by this deed of Qayin the Soul of Abel became bound to the liminal point within all such intersections and there remained and will do so until the end of time. Within the esoteric tradition Abel is identified as the guardian of the graves and the keeper of all cemetery gates and he is known as the Black Hound and the Herder of the Restless Souls, for in ways similar to how he in life had tamed the white dog to herd his sheep, he himself became in death tamed by the Lord of the Cemetery, made to rise from his grave to serve as the drover of all the restless dead and those other shades and spirits that would haunt the places of burial; the Fields of Harvest now turned into the Fields of Skulls and Bones. The zoomorphism of Abel's earthbound soul holds many fundamental mysteries and beside the more common shape of a large Black Hound with often glowing eyes, he is also known to take form as a monstrous Three-Headed Dog, shackled around the necks with a leash of thorn, a leash of gold and a leash of fire, this reflecting the three clay-horn 401"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Adamite aspects conquered by Qayin and Qalmana, resulting in their own transcendence and apotheosis. In this post-mortem form the first murdered and buried, the first dead human sowed into the land, became Abel the Black, who in his tamed and bound state actually received an elevation from Qayin, as he was made to serve a cause more noble than what he ever had been destined to by the decrees of his own Creator. It is this Abel the Black that we pay homage to and ask permission from when entering the cemetery gates, in the name of his Master, Qayin Lord of the Mound, and it is him that we pay with the three coins when exiting the cemetery, in order for him to close the gates behind us and hinder all unwanted shades and spirits from following us out through the gate or in some other manner attaching themselves to us. The Qayinite mysteries of Abel the Black can be found reflected in many different traditions of the world, in which the first dead or the first buried becomes the guardian of the cemetery. For example there is an old Scandinavian tradition concerning a spirit called the Church Grim, which was a fearsome ghost guarding a church and its churchyard against thieves and grave robbers, but who also protected the living against the dark and restless dead, by keeping such phantoms inside the boundaries of the sacred grounds of the graveyard. Within these traditions such Church Grim was created through the ritual burial of a living victim, most often an animal, but according to some sources also humans were at times sacrificed in this manner and entombed under the foundation of a new church, in order to create a guardian who would become the appointed Genius Loci, bound to serve as its protector. According to existing sources it was often the first living creature that happened to pass by the place chosen for the building of the new church that the builders had to trap and bury alive under one of the would-be cornerstones, thus binding its soul to the building and its surroundings and through incantations and prayers conjuring it to remain as its guardian. 402 The animal so employali dog or any other kind Ill the selected spot and ei chosen and led to the .. for the dreaded Church 1 l Even though any animll watchdog seems to halll are therefore many U.. choice.

Even though any animal could be used as the sacrifice the idea of a watchdog seems to have made most sense in many cases and there are therefore many instances where the dog has been the preferred choice. In one known case, in Sweden, a white horse is reported to have been released and allowed to choose the spot where the new church would be built and where the horse stopped the place became marked and the horse itself became buried alive in that spot in order to become a very fierce guardian of the place. Whatever the inhumed creature had been in life it would in its Church Grim form become fearsome, awe-inspiring and often monstrous, especially in the eyes of those who in some way would offend it. These kinds of sacrificial rites are of course of pagan roots and can be traced back to the offerings given to the chthonic spirits and earth deities in order to obtain a firm foundation to build upon and protection against all hostile forces, gained through the blessings expected from the deities to whom the sacrifices were made. An interesting addition to the Church Grim lore is that within certain communities it was also believed that the first person within the parish who died after New Year's Eve would become an assistant of the Church Grim and aid it in its protection of the treasures of the church and the graves of the dead and punish those who would wrongfully trespass the established boundaries of the hallowed grounds that they were bound to guard. In other relevant traditions it was also believed that the first person buried in a graveyard would become the guardian of that place and in order to prevent the soul of a human to become thus bound to such 403"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"a sombre task an animal was instead buried alive where a new cemetery would be established, this in order to create the guardian and save the soul of the first human that later would be buried there from becoming the earthbound guardian ghost of that cemetery. There were, and still are, other traditions in which the first man or I and woman buried within a cemetery become venerated as the rulers and guardians of the dead buried within that place and the attainment of that post is viewed more as an elevation and a blessing upon those chosen dead rather than a curse. Another related and very interesting lore connected to our own Qayinite mysteries, which we consider to be the esoteric foundation for all these other mentioned traditions, is the one derived from the folklore of French Brittany, concerning the Ankou, who is depicted as a Grim Reaper of souls and a personification of Death. This scythe-bearing messenger of death is according to certain folklore identified with Qayin - the Harvester and Murderer, who through the first act of murder is thought to have become bound to the task of harvesting souls and to the eternal service of death. While Ankou in his origin is a pagan deity it is for us of great interest to contemplate the folkloric interpretations concerning his true identity according to rural folk-Catholicism. According to these beliefs Ankou himself was the primary representative and bringer of death, but he had also a multitude of lesser Ankous, who served him in his grim harvest. These secondary and subservient Ankous are the ones relevant to this discourse as they are also thought to be the first person buried within a cemetery and the last person to die and become buried by the end of each year. These lesser servants of death have to work for Ankou for at least one full year from the time of their burial, until their responsibilities can be shouldered by another dead. According to more esoteric aspects of the tradition in question this passing of the torch does never affect the First Killer and the First Dead and they and only they remain the main representatives of Death and the Dead.

As for the zoomorphic manifestation of the first dead there are also links connecting different relevant traditions to our own Qayinite Necrosophy. The black dog has in many different contexts been connected to the forces of the underworld, the dead and death itself. In order to just point out a few of the many relevant traditional contexts in which the dog has been understood as a servant of death, a guardian of the chthonic gates or in some other way become connected to the dead we could here mention the black hounds of Hekate, the Kerberus (the three-headed guardian of the underworld), the four-eyed dogs of the death god Yama, the \"four-eyed\" guardian dogs employed within ancient Persian funerary rites, the hound guarding the kingdom of Erlik Khan, the Armenian dog of death called Siaw (the Black), the monstrous hell hound Garm (the guardian of the gate of Hel), the Welsh death hounds of Annwn, the East Anglian ghostly Black Shuck and from certain perspectives even the dogs accompanying Saint Lazarus . Within the Qayinite Tradition 'the Ghost of Akeldama' and 'the Guardian of Gulgaltha' are titles given to Abel the Black, in his aspect as the Grave Grim, as he here serves as the guardian of the boundaries of the grave and the gatekeeper of all cemeteries. Abel is thus viewed and worked with as an important mystery and force of the cemetery, serving directly under the King and Queen of all the places of the skull. Abel the Black manifests through the bones of the first man buried in each cemetery, but his soul is his own and the bones he manifests himself through are only the physical points of egress through which his earthbound and undead shade gains access to All Fields of Gulgaltha, while fundamentally being shackled to and through that first grave dug by Our Master Qayin. 405"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"His manifestations are therefore never influenced by the dead through which he has gained access to each cemetery that he guards, as the soul belonging to that dead becomes always fully overshadowed by his own unnaturally empowered shade. As the sentinel of the places of the dead Abel the Black is most effective and in accordance with his Master's decree all desecraters of graves become hounded down by him and punished with soul afflicting misery, weakness, sickness, pain, madness and death, often through fire, as he who became subdued by a Son of Fire knows very well of the destructive effect that scorching heat can have upon fallible clay. As the Herder of the Dead he holds power over all day-born dead, specially the Restless, Dark and Obsessive ones and it is he, Abel the Grave Grim, who by the will of Qayin and His Bride keeps such dead within the confines of the graveyards or lets them loose to afflict the living who in some ways have incurred the wrath of the Monarchs of the Gulgaltha. During our workings with the Dark Dead, we must therefore always first gain the permission of Qayin and then ask of Abel to aid in the tracking down of the suitable dead and to open the cemetery gates and release the dead in question so that he/she can accomplish his/ her required task. In similar ways to how Abel can aid in the lunching of such 'sending of the dead' he can also, in the name of Qayin, be petitioned and conjured to force back such restless dead and drag them back to their graves whenever one wishes to thwart the 'sending' of another, in order to for example save a victim of such rites of 'expediting death' through the ferocious dead. A common method often employed within such settings is the cleansing of the victim with the aid of a live animal, like for example a black chicken, hen or rooster, by passing the animal over the victims whole body, while in the name of Qayin, Qalmana and Abel the Black conjuring the dead obsessing and afflicting the person being cleansed to enter the animal instead.

Abel the Grave-Hound is thus conjured to take back the dead which had afflicted the victim of the sending of the Dark Dead, but also to return the attack back to its sender, if there be any, so that the dead, now empowered by the animal it has fully received, in the Name of Qayin and by the force of Abel, takes vengeance upon the assailant, or otherwise just remains bound to its confines within the jurisdiction of the Grave Grim. Conjuring Seal of Abel the Grave Hound An alternative approach to situations such as the one described is to employ Abel himselffor the wreaking of vengeance upon the assailant, when the existence of such aggressor is known for sure. Three animals are in such cases used to cleanse the victim of the curse of the Dark Dead and then buried alive as offerings to Abel the Three-Headed, in order to feed him and contract him to lend his aid, give him the means through which he can tear off the obsessing shade from the victim and keep it down in the grave and also give him the scent of the assailant, so that he can become able to hound him/her down. In ways resembling the ones already described, but with much less potency and complexity, one can also use three or nine fresh eggs 407"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"instead of the live animals in order to cleanse oneself or someone else and then bury the eggs in ways similar to the methods already described. Similar methods can be employed within baneful rites in which Abel himself is sought to be sent against an enemy, in order to consume his/her vitality and finally drag his/her soul back into the darkness of the grave. Within such workings a black cat becomes baptized as the target of the curse and if possible further enlinked to the target via the correct use of sympathetic elements, which for example can be fed to it. The animal is then buried alive in order to create a haunting shade that then in the name of Qayin and through the power of Abel the Black is sent out to attack the target of the curse, to which it carries links and because of whom it has died. Upon the grave of the black cat the Seal of Abel the Grave Hound is marked with a Blackthorn wand and the seal is given nine coins, libation offering of white, black and red, tobacco smoke and the flames of nine black candles, while Abel himself is conjured, in the name of Qayin, to empower, oversee and direct the shade of the sacrificed animal to harshly afflict the victim. Soil from the four corners of the animal's grave is to be harvested during such sending of the animal's enraged ghost and sprinkled over the path of the target, or in some other way be made to come in close contact with him/her. Such curses are well known for their potency when it comes to the causing of madness, sickness and suicide. Beside these rites of 'taking off or 'the sending the dead' there are many other contexts in which Abel receives buried offerings, as that which is buried within the cemetery always falls directly within his realm of influence, since he was the First Buried. Whenever his services, beyond his primary duties as the guardian of the cemetery gates, are sought he must therefore be given some form of buried offering, plus certain other more common gifts of coin, libation, smoke and flame. ��� 408 A potent ritual for Gaining tMII suitable cemetery during the • according to traditional proto�!�� the Master and asking for � shade of Abel in order to feedAj in connection to all future wodlill is given one is to walk widderd!W towards its northern cardinallll spot, place a black candle U...

If permission is given one is to walk widdershins around the cemetery's circumference towards its northern cardinal point and there, upon a well chosen spot, place a black candle inscribed with the Signature of the First Dead and anointed with sanctified oil empowered with an equal amount of the essences of Henbane, Aconite and Wormwood. Signature of the First Dead In front of each candle a raw piece of pork, seven copper coins, a piece of quartz crystal and three onyx stones are to be buried. The space around the candle and the buried offerings are then encircled, widdershins, first thrice with a Blackthorn wand, then thrice with a Rose wand and finally encircled, in an equal amount of time, with a Rowan wand. Abel the Black is called upon to attend, by stamping left foot three times upon the ground and exclaiming his name, once for each stamp, while all other dead are because of the powers of the nine barriers set in place barred from entering and accessing the offerings 409"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"served, all in the name of Qayin Dominor Tumulus. Abel's candle is given flame to, in the name of the one who killed and buried him and he is conjured to accept the offerings given to him and in return grant the Sight, of himself and of those that he guards. A small bowl is at that time placed upon the place of the buried offerings and filled with clear well water. Libation offering is poured out in nine circles around the bowl and its contents is then given 13 exhalations of the smoke of a cigar, which then is placed to the left side of the small bowl of water. The whole process is repeated until candles have been placed and lit also upon the western, southern and eastern points of the graveyard and the circumambulation is completed by again returning to the Northern point and candle. If the candle still burns one can proceed and at that point wash the eyes with some of the water contained inside the bowl placed upon that northern point. The process is again repeated in the same succession as before by going to each candle illuminating one of the four cardinal points of the cemetery and by washing the eyes with the water placed before each such candle of Abel the Black. If this whole process is repeated for three full circumambulations, during which the eyes are washed three times with the water contained in the bowls placed upon each of the points of Abel, with the flames of the candles still burning, the Power of Sight will be obtained. At that point, when having returned once again to the northern starting point, one is to head in a straight line towards the centre and the fifth point of the cross created by the positioned candles and there one will be able to see the visions sought and the assembling shades of the dead and the one who herds them will at that point become witnessed. ��� 410 Even without having obtainei;. upon Abel in order to obtain Wll often done by the inside of tM the cemetery, as it is there that• one, for example, is searching'!,! else lying hidden and buried I .,,.

Even without having obtained the Sight of the Dead one can still call upon Abel in order to obtain his guidance and protection. This is most often done by the inside of the gate through which one had entered the cemetery, as it is there that he is conjured to grant his aid whenever one, for example, is searching for a specific kind of dead or for something else lying hidden and buried within the boundaries of the boneyard. After having obtained the permission of the Master one returns back to the left side of the threshold of the gate through which one had first entered the boneyard and by the discreet tracing of the conjuring seal upon the soil and the giving of three coins, a lit cigar and the thrice pouring out of strong libation, Abel the Black will become enticed to come in order to lend his aid and in the name of Qayin guide one's footsteps to the specified kind of dead that one needs in connection to the different workings or whatever else it is that one needs to find with his help. Through the aid of Abel the Black it becomes, for example, much easier to find the grave or shade of any specific kind of dead, be it the obsessive, dark and cursed or the Blessed and Mighty, as long as their remains are kept within the burial grounds that he guards . Such guidance is gained concretely by the way of intuition, omens, visions or other forms of more or less subtle revelations pointing towards the requested place, shade or spirit. Our Mighty Saint Qayin is the Sinistral Lord of Death, while Abel is the first of the dead. Qayin is the King of the Mighty Dead and Master of the Dark Dead, while Abel is like an enforcer of only the dark and the profane dead of all cemeteries, under the direct dominion of Qayin. Abel has in other words no power over the Mighty Dead, but he does hold power over all other dead outside of the Holy Bloodline of Qayin, within all the places of burial.

Such aspect-specific fetish serves to channel, focus and amplify the links to the King of Gulgaltha already established via the seating of the Master's essence within the general central altar fetish. By creating a fetish specifically representing His aspects as the First Gravedigger /Lord of the Black Cross, the parts of His Soul and Spirit connected to the sphere of influence under the dominion of those aspects become further enlinked to and made stronger in presence, which in turn leads to the fortifying of all the workings ofNecrosophic Sorcery conducted through it. By making such aspect-specific fetish the selected fraction of the Master's boundless powers in its enlinked form is homed in on and amplified, which means that the general central altar fetish must constitute that primary connection to His Soul and Spirit before the creation of this and other similar, secondary, fetishes becomes possible, as one cannot multiply or enhance that which one does not possess or even have access to.

The nadir of the work and the polar opposite of that Exalted Crown of the Mighty Dead is on the other hand connected to the Dark Dead and is most often concerned with the pernicious rites of malediction, madness, misery and death. These Dark Dead are the restless, tormented and tormenting souls of the earthbound dead, who because of their lack of spirit and their material obsessions, consciously or unconsciously cling to their earthly existence, or because of some other reason have so become bound to suffer as one of the in tranquil and lonely shades haunting this world. Rage, fear, pain, lust, confusion, madness and hate can be counted amongst the more common reasons for why some of the dead become earthbound, dangerous and often in more ways than one parasitic in their interactions with the living.

According to some systems of thought also the souls of the unborn, especially those purposely aborted, can join this legion of the dark and vengeful dead and even though their consciousness had not developed in life they gain a sort of bestial awareness in death, which makes them potentially very dangerous. All these ferocious and harmful dead have because of their unnatural state of being assumed an antagonistic role within the realms of both the living and the dead and cause usually nothing but suffering, sorrow and death. It is these shades that our Master Qayin, in His aspect as the Lord of the Dark Dead, owns, commands and controls and it is these dead that Abel the Black herds, keeps in check or lets loose, all according to the decrees of the one who holds his own leashes, for in truth is Abel not only the First Dead but he is also the first and the most elevated amongst the Dark Dead, because of his taming by the hands of the Master. Within the practical work there are more or less only two different approaches when it comes to these kinds of the dead; one is to banish them and to protect one's self or others against them and the other is to direct their venomous souls against those who deserve the suffering which the Dark Dead always tend to bring upon those afflicted by their envenoming presence. There are certain things that one must possess and know before working with these kinds of the dead; one must possess the knowledge and empowerments granted by Qayin in His aspect as Master of the Dark Dead, one must know how to raise them and how to put them down, 437"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"one must know how to direct them, one must know how to bind them (both to a victim and to their own graves or other places of confinement), one must know how to feed them and how to heat them up, one must know how to protect against their contagious darkness and how to wash away their black stains and one must know when to use them, which of them to use and how to find the specific kind needed for the work at hand. The Sceptre of the Shadows of Death, the Belli cum Wand of Qayin Dominor Tumulus, is for example one of the most important tools when it comes to the workings connected to these kinds of the dead, for when such sceptre has been obtained correctly it will be, amongst other things, an outer sign of the inner fortifications and insights into the relevant mysteries gained from the Master, but a wrongfully obtained sceptre will aid in nothing but one's own sinking into the darkness of the restless dead as it in such case will hold no power over them and will grant no protection against their rage and hunger. The black and white rosary talisman of the Master are also of great value and power within these kinds of workings and if consecrated properly they will aid greatly in both the summoning and controlling the Dark Dead, but also in keeping a safe distance between one's self and these bestial revenants. Besides the empowerments and protection granted by the Master, there are also those of the First Earthbound Dead, Abel, which one needs to acquire before embarking upon the infernal road of the Dark Dead, as it is he who in the name of Qayin controls such wicked and foul shades and by the grace of the Master and through Abel one can also gain such control. When the necessary knowledge, power and spiritual licenses needed for a correct approach towards the workings connected to these kinds of the dead have been obtained one can, in accordance with sound judgment and for the sake of justified causes, seek out these kinds of miserable souls and put them to work, set them upon the guilty and remove them from the truly innocent. ���oE 438 When it comes to the fill categorisation and identillll there are a few groups a.­us, when it comes to bodMI a short list of some of� conditions and the cau.sest8 it comes to how they cad controlled, but such k:nollll decisions when it comes II specific situation so that tl best suited for the work • The Murderous De..t·....a violent and of those wida • in life who in death colllill of others.

The following is a short list of some of those Dark Dead and the understanding of their conditions and the causes of their suffering are actual key points when it comes to how they can be accessed, fed, agitated, quickened and controlled, but such knowledge will also help in making the correct decisions when it comes to choosing the right kind of dead for any specific situation so that the dead conjured possesses the qualities best suited for the work at hand. The Murderous Dead-These are the shades of the hateful, the violent and of those with an immense bloodlust and murderous rage in life who in death continue to strive for bloodshed and the demise of others. These Dark Dead are as double-edged swords, for even if they with ease can be directed to destroy others they can with equal ease turn upon the one who seeks their baneful services, as they are like bloodthirsty beasts and need to be bound firmly to their tasks, lest they cut off the hand that tries to wield them. The souls of these obsessed murderers can in a very efficient manner provoke acts of violence, bloodshed, suicide and murder. The Murdered Dead -These are those amongst the Dark Dead that have remained in a shocked state of both mind and soul and because of the violence that has led to their demise often become bound to and haunt their places of death. They may not always seek conscious and directed vengeance, but they are most often in a confused and enraged state, caught in a limbo where they relive the terror and pain of their own murder. These dead can cause much harm and are often bringers of confusion, anger, mental anguish and madness, but they can also provoke violence and murder, as they can influence the minds of the living in a very concrete manner. The Burnt and the Burning Dead -These are the ones that have been burnt alive and in death still remain within the flames of their mind and soul afflicting pain and horror. The visions of purgatory and the flames of hell are often connected to the sights conveyed by these 439"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"tormented dead and have in truth very little to do with any kind of purgatorial cleansing. The other sub-category falling under this heading is those amongst the perverse dead that have been obsessed pyromaniacs and arsonists in life that have caused the suffering and deaths of others through fire and taken delight in the agony and destruction that they have induced and still seek to cause. In either case these kinds of Dark Dead remain in death obsessed with burning and fire, in different ways, and they often cause pain, terror, madness and horrible accidents, disfigurements and death by the way of fire. The Drowned Dead -These are those restless souls of the drowned which often stay attached to and trapped within the bodies of water where they have died and there they often cause drowning accidents. It is these Dark Dead that often have been mistaken for undines and other aquatic spirits and besides causing tragedies in connection to water they are also known to be effective bringers of nightmare, madness and in some cases serious breathing problems and suffocation. The Insane Dead -These are the lunatics afflicted with mind shattering forms of insanity in life which becomes carried over with them even in death and there binds them to a nightmarish, earthbound, existence. Because of their mental confusion these Dark Dead can often not grasp their own deaths and continue to haunt their familiar surroundings, people or the things that they have felt some form of strong attachment to in life, in a state of perpetual madness. These insane souls cause nightmares, confusion and madness and are known to be effective destroyers of the minds of the living, as their lunacy is most contagious in the cases where they attach themselves to them. The Plague Bearing Dead -These are some of those that have died because of painful and contagious diseases that in life had destroyed both their bodies and minds. They remain obsessed with their sickness and suffering even in death and become thus bound to a state of nightmarish anguish. These Dark Dead are called the plague bearers as they can afflict the living with the symptoms of their own diseases and so also manifest such sickness physically, as the seed of any sickness is first planted in the subtle planes before it can manifest in flesh. 440 The Suicides -These .. have not found any PSCaJIIII which they had sought to til because of their attachmliil destructive impulses. � cause sorrow, madness, tiiJiil and self-destructive tendll!!ll . ·� The Vengeful Dead -� in life have been and in .. or unjust strive for � retaliation and are best Willi their own obsessive se� such as these are effectiwet and they are especially IIIII someone in similar mall themselves to have beea • dangerous as they easily • them and one must tt.l fortification before souls·• The Unrepentant :0.. impenitent and merciles 1 and material attachments. 1 in order to combat and� in return for offerings pill or addictions, which �I These are another unit af I knowledge and great prep and without peril.

These tormented shades possess the power to cause sorrow, madness, fear and depression and can provoke suicidal and self-destructive tendencies within the target they are sent against. The Vengeful Dead -These are those amongst the Dark Dead who in life have been and in death continue to be obsessed with their just or unjust strive for vengeance. These shades serve all forms of retaliation and are best worked by those sharing, on a very deep level, their own obsessive sentiments concerning vengeance. Intranquil souls such as these are effective when merciless and harsh justice is sought and they are especially good to employ when the target has wronged someone in similar manners that one of these dead considers themselves to have been wronged. Shades such as these are very dangerous as they easily can possess the minds of those who call upon them and one must therefore possess sufficient knowledge and fortification before souls such as these are worked with. The Unrepentant Dead -These are the souls of hardened, impenitent and merciless criminals obsessed because of their vices and material attachments. They are called upon within certain contexts in order to combat and escape the law and successfully commit crimes, in return for offerings pertaining to and satisfying their base desires, or addictions, which they had in life and continue to have in death. These are another unit of the Dark Dead which require very specific knowledge and great preparation if they are to be worked properly and without peril. The Lonely Dead -These are the tormented souls of the cheerless, regretful and lonely dead, often thought to be in a state of purging suffering, without anyone ever having cared for them or loved them and it is this perceived lack of love and kindness which often is thought to be the cause of their obsession and unnatural attachment to the realm of the living. Some of these souls are believed to suffer in death because of some presumed sin or wrongdoing, which they obsessed 441"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"about in life and continue to do so in death, where they place themselves in the parts of the lower astral that best corresponds with the most common ideas concerning purgatory. These mournful Dark Dead are most often called upon in order to cause regret and sorrow, or in order to afflict a person's five senses with all of their own sufferings until he/she does as demanded of him/her, but these tormented souls can also cause depression, self destructive behaviour and even provoke suicide. The Cursed Dead -These are the Dark Dead who have died because of some form of sorcery that had been directed towards them in life and they are often in death bound by that same curse and made to remain a captive of the elements or spirits which had caused their unnatural deaths. These damned shades are only accessible and useful if one knows how and why they became cursed and by which powers they in death are kept subjugated, for with such knowledge they can become efficient slaves and serve many forms of highly effective malefica. Most often such privileged knowledge is only accessible to the one who has caused the death of the soul in question, but there are of course other esoteric means through which one can learn about the fate befallen the dead, all according to the different rites of necromancy and through the aid of the Faithful Famuli received from the side of Qayin and His Bride. The Stinging, Crawling and Snaring Dead -These are those amongst the restless dead who have been killed by poisonous insects, spiders or other crawling and venomous animals. They are caught within a perpetual nightmare of their own death and that which has killed them and their shades often assume bizarre forms because of the unnatural synthesis between their own human souls and that of the shadow of the creature that had killed them. Another reason for the manifestation of these insectoid or otherwise crawling and stinging forms of the Dark Dead can also be an extreme phobia, obsession or attraction towards these kinds of creatures in life. These dead can leave actual bite marks upon the body of their victim, swarm them in their nightmares and cause sickness of both body, mind and soul. 442 The Vampiric Delli undead rising from Ill lifeblood of the liW.. blood, even though hll thirst for, but what • very life-force of ai(J unconscious pa� continue to act as ailj Life they themseMs'! ·::illj natural means.

The Vampiric Dead -These are the Dark Dead of legends, the undead rising from the graves in order to hunt, haunt and drink the lifeblood of the living. In truth these are not the drinkers of physical blood, even though blood and other bodily fluids carry that which they thirst for, but what vampiric shades such as these hunger for is the very life-force of all living beings and because of their conscious or unconscious parasitic impulses and traits developed in life they continue to act as souls obsessed by and craving for the Breaths of Life they themselves are unable to produce, or maintain, through natural means. The atavistic form assumed by these Night Flyers is that of bats or nocturnal birds of prey and they are also known to possess the attributes of the Succubi and Incubi when stalking the dreams of the living. Dark Dead such as these possess the power to empty a target of his/her vitality, bring weakness, sickness, nightmares and madness and slowly cause death through the siphoning and theft of the target's vital force. 443"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56 mtstnrt.eb �l}abnws nf tl}.e C!Taluaru QTrnss We will here present the signatures of the Dark Dead obtained through a multitude of different treaties and covenants with Qayin, in His aspect as the Lord of the Dark Dead and the legions of famuli serving that specific path of Our Holy Monarch of Skulls. Each signature is connected to a specific grouping of these malefic shades cast by the Black Cross of Gulgaltha and through the linear conjurations that these signatures constitute they are all bound by the Master to serve His cause. This does not mean that their use is without hazard, on the contrary it must be made clear that the workings of these bestial souls of the obsessed is actually amongst the most dangerous practices pertaining to the necrosophic sorceries of our Qayinite Tradition, but as the goal of our Work is to offer insight into the diverse aspects and manifestations of His Art, it is important to also shed light upon this most dark topic, and make available the keys through which the closed paths to the core of certain fundamental mysteries can be opened, and lead the wise to new darksome illuminations and at the same time usher the foolish and the profane further down into the graves that they insist on digging for themselves. These thirteen signatures that we present are employed both as beckoning signals and fetters, evoking the shades connected to them and at the same time placing them under the power of the Black Cross Upon the First Mound. In order to work these signatures one must therefore first obtain the permission of the relevant aspect of the Master and then proceed with great care, making sure to cleanse, fortify and protect body, mind and soul before these foul ghosts are approached. 444 Such preparation should IIIII the magical donning of tile ! anointments and the t:aliail self, all in the name and tlllll specific sorceries. ·� Of even greater importa.nce411 after these interactions .... remaining link to the� till their malefic and rave� the one who had called 4 conducted through the .-1 act upon their animal m.l properly forced and dirediJII be trusted and must thereil sternly.

Of even greater importance are the cleansings which must be performed after these interactions with the Dark Dead in order to remove any remaining link to them, through which they otherwise, because of their malefic and ravenous nature, could inflict their suffering upon the one who had called upon them, even if such calling had been conducted through the authority of their Master. As these dead only act upon their animal instincts and obsessive drives they may be properly forced and directed, but they can never be made loyal or ever be trusted and must therefore always be treated both cautiously and sternly. There are a few different ways through which these signatures of the damned can be activated during their conjurations and summoning and most often it is inside the cemeteries or the places known to be haunted by these shades that such workings are conducted, as it is not advisable to ever invite these dead to one's own house by conducting these evocations in front of the home altar. Most often the signatures are traced upon suitable pieces of black or red cloth that in beforehand has been ritually washed in an infusion made with one, three or seven plants possessing powers that can facilitate the interactions with these kinds of restless dead. Such piece of cloth is usually left to air dry in front of the Master's fetishes, or hung on His black altar cross, if such a symbol of Gulgaltha is present upon or in front of His altar, and when dried folded and kept upon the altar until use. Instead of the black or red cloth also paper, of suitable size and colour, can be used and receive the empowerments of the plant spirits via the sprinkling of the infusion and/or through fumigation. In other cases the signature may be directly marked upon the ground or even on the backside of a gravestone, in such cases where the Dark Dead 445"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"sought is identified as the person buried in that specific grave. The tracing itself is most often done with some kind of consecrated chalk, paint or powder, but in certain contexts the signatures can also be marked with the tips of suitable wands, such as those of Blackthorn, Ebony, Yew, Elder, Alder, Cypress and the Black Ironwood, with knives or in other ways become imprinted upon any suitable surface in connection to the place haunted by these shades. When it comes to the making and consecration of the chalk used to call upon the Dark Dead there are many different elements from the mineral, the plant and the animal kingdom that can be mixed with the white plaster or black charcoal powder, which are the two main carriers most often employed. Some of the most useful minerals to mix, in moderate amounts, into such chalk are Cinnabar, sulphur and Red Iron Oxide. Cinnabar possesses all the virtues of the swift mercury with the addition of the heating qualities granted by its colour, sulphur possesses the burning, banishing and commending powers and is an element much in harmony with the infernal chthonic realms and Red Iron Oxide, being the very blood of iron, possesses fierce martial qualities empowering all workings of aggression. Also, small amounts of gunpowder can be added to the mix in order to grant further explosive and expediting qualities to the mixture. When it comes to the plant elements employed they can vary from case to case, but within the workings of the Dark Dead the following plants are some of the ones most often used: Angel's Trumpet, Cypress, Yew, Blackthorn, Poplar, Black Ironwood, Aconite, Black Hellebore, Hemlock, Henbane, Mandrake, Mullein, Thorn Apple, Valerian, Wormwood, Alder, Rosary Peas and Castor Beans. By understanding the powers of the spirit of each plant one will be able decide which one to employ within each specific working. From the animal kingdom black cats, pigs, dogs, bats, ravens, crows, owls, maggots, scorpions, centipedes, frogs, toads, spiders and other venomous crawling creatures are most often employed and their blood, 446 crushed bones or bodies • focus and magical c� order to further connect illi of Dark Dead that it is .. � When all the elements ... their task and become ea1 mixed together, prayed ti!JI one-tenth of the whole 1 foundation of the sorcen���� employed, and the elelllllll instead of water, must Ill tl for the plaster base to heal of the chalk mixture is sulil! and moisture needed.

When all the elements have been selected, consecrated, dedicated to their task and become empowered by their respective spirits they are mixed together, prayed over and finally blended in the amount of one-tenth of the whole mixture that is meant to constitute the foundation of the sorcerous chalk. Depending on the kind of plaster employed, and the elements mixed into it, sufficient amount of liquor, instead of water, must at this time be added to the mixture in order for the plaster base to become thick. Usually 1 part liquor to 2 parts of the chalk mixture is sufficient in order to get the correct consistency and moisture needed. If charcoal is used instead of plaster, in order to create black chalk, egg whites are used in addition to a smaller amount of alcohol than what would be used in plaster mixture, just enough to give the mixture of elements a smooth and thick consistency, allowing them to be formed into suitable shapes. For the forming and drying of the moist chalk mixture waxed paper can be used and made into simple moulds, of suitable sizes and shapes, into which the chalk mixture is poured. These are then placed upon a plate and positioned upon the altar of the Master for at least seven nights, in order to slowly dry and receive the full empowerments. Each night they are given smoke of tobacco, the flame of a candle and in the name of Qayin conjured and charged to possess all the qualities needed for the tasks that they have been created for. In whichever way the signatures are traced, be it with the consecrated chalks or through some other suitable means, they must still be further worked before they become fully opened. Usually certain offerings and elements are placed upon the power points of the signature, plus any link to the target of the spell that one wishes to send the Dark Dead against. Libation, raw meat, incense and candles are amongst the offerings most often given within such settings and within the most 447"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"extreme cases even live animals are sacrificed and fed to these malicious shades in order to empower them fully before they are sent out to their work. The libation offerings given are strong liquors, wines or black unsweetened coffee. The food offerings consist often of hearts, livers and brains, different kinds of raw meat, especially pork, served sometimes with black beans, chilli and black pepper. As for the incense used when these dead are called upon through their signatures, there are a few formulas that have proven most effective, one of them being the following: � 7 parts Cypress � 7 parts Yew � 7 parts Wormwood � 3 parts Mullein � 3 parts Aconite � 3 parts Henbane � 1 part Sulphur Each plant element must be consecrated according to tradition, through the powers of Master Qatsiyr, and become thus empowered by its own Black In Green, which in turn must be petitioned to lend specific aid to these workings, before they are mixed together, with the sulphur being added last. The smoke of this Dark Dead Incense acts, according to the governing pacts through which these mysteries have been revealed, as a key to the parts of the signature which at this point would still have remained closed and gives further substance and power to the manifestations of the wraiths summoned. As for the candles used, they are always black, marked with the signature of the Dark Dead and anointed with suitable magical oil, most often consisting of a mineral oil base into which the same elements like the ones in the Dark Dead Incense, or other herbal and mineral elements specifically relevant to the work at hand, are steeped. 448 It should be observed that, Cll! conducted within other COIIIII!II sprayed directly from the -in connection to the work will to give them any more pal necessary, and as saliva aJMlil of the personal essence, �4111111 and quickening these sb.adalil <4 Besides the somewhat ge������ certain specific elements wlli signatures, depending on wli one seeks to summon, in Obi further strengthen the maJiifi are the elements pertain� the shades represented by 6j For the Murderous Dead Slllll symbolic link to the deeds lll!illl be presented upon the silll murderer's grave can be­the soil bought from a place .. should be used.

Besides the somewhat general offerings mentioned, there are also certain specific elements which could be placed upon or around the signatures, depending on which category of the Dark Dead it is that one seeks to summon, in order to focus the powers of the work and further strengthen the manifestation of the dead called forth. These are the elements pertaining specifically to the binding obsessions of the shades represented by the signature. For the Murderous Dead some weapon, tool, element or other potent symbolic link to the deeds and forces of homicidal aggression should be presented upon the signature, unless the soil from a known murderer's grave can be employed instead. For the Murdered Dead the soil bought from a place of murder or the grave of a murder victim should be used. For the Burnt and the Burning Dead a container of glowing embers or some other fiery elements should be presented. For the Drowned Dead a bowl of water, ideally collected from a lake where drowning has occurred, is to be placed. For the Insane Dead soil from a mental hospital or the graves of the mentally ill is to be employed. For the Plague Bearing Dead the soil from a hospital or the graves of those that have died because of contagious and deadly diseases are to be used. For the Suicides soil from a place of suicide or the grave of one who has died by his/her own hands is to be placed. For the Vengeful Dead written accounts about the deeds which are going to be avenged, penned by the one wronged by the target of the curse, or some other concrete links to that which is the cause of the retaliation sought should be present. For the Unrepentant Dead elements linked directly to their vices and causes of obsession can be presented upon the signature. For the Lonely Dead there are a few mysteries one must have insight into before they can be called upon 449"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"in the most potent manner, but a glass of cool water, one single flame and a container of soil from a place of the abandoned and forgotten dead can be placed.

For the Stinging, Crawling and Snaring Dead live or dead scorpions, centipedes, spiders and/or any other such creatures or elements pertaining to this category of the obsessed dead should be placed upon the signature, and for the Vampiric Dead elements pertaining to vampirism, such as certain animals and certain plants, but also fresh spilled blood should be placed. The links to the target of any malefic work conducted through these signatures are on the other hand most often placed upon the fanged mouth of the skull, or in some other position where the dark currents of the signature are focused or directed towards, via the points, crosses, arrows, elements and offerings. When working with these signatures, it is also customary to employ two smaller Rowan wands, branded with Qayin's Key sigil of Protection, and place them crossed, in the form of an X, upon the ground somewhere under the skull depicted in the signature. This is done in order to block any of their emanations from coming down upon one's self, as it is most often in that spot, underneath the skull, one stands after the full activation of the signature employed, in order to conjure the shades evoked. In the case of those signatures that have a downward pointing vertical line, passing all the way through the skulls, the crossed Rowan wands are to be placed in front of the endpoint of such vertical lines, in order to protect against the emanations flowing through them. If suitable Rowan wands are not accessible, those of any other tree possessing the powers to protect against the Dark Dead can be used instead. The whole working, including the crossed wands, is usually left to remain upon and around the signature, as everything becomes soiled by the envenoming presence of these shades, but in those cases where the signature needs to be erased and removed, a strong infusion bearing 450 the powers of Rue, Ya blend consisting of lila any lingering influ� By knowing the � these Dark Dead caa I able to also figure 01111 their presence is � attracting elements wi and changing the pelili restless shades, one a their haunting. iS!

It is a powerful oil for the anointment of one's own body after cleansing baths following any working with the Dark Dead and possesses the power to utterly remove any lingering stain caused by the interaction with shades so foul. This blend falls under Saint Qayin of Gulgaltha, being the Master of the Wandering Dead and the owner of All Graves and should receive its empowerments both through the Green Point of the Skull and the sigil of the King of Gulgaltha. The following are the elements which are to be blended into a carrier oil base, such as Almond or Olive oil, and therein be left for at least 49 nights, during which the bottle is to be shaken each night, while the spirits of the plants within it are prayed to grant their protection against all offensive shades and spirits: � 3 parts Blackthorn leaves � 3 parts Palo Santo wood powder � 2 parts Salvia � 2 parts Rue � 2 parts Yerba Mate � 1 parts Benzoin � 1 parts Myrrh The Protection Oil is to be applied upon the body from the nadir to the zenith, starting with the sole of the feet and then moving upwards 462 to the solar plexus, heut.,l neck, forehead, cr0\\\\'11 ef while praying to the Malllll shades and spirits and tDf!l them. n This exact same formolaa incense blend, serving 1111 the most severe cases, ..... such oil and incense a.. l bath and would in such c:lll and other astral taints. � '�jil ' .. ·1 ·\"'! ·� .., '.1 ·� .:l I \"' d ··I"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"lacainst the shades and jpinst all forms of astral �af one's own body after pa the Dark Dead and illlering stain caused by i 11-. being the Master of !IRS and should receive il.t of the Skull and the �! pWended into a carrier � be left for at least ���len each night, while p pant their protection IlDdy from the nadir to hhen moving upwards to the solar plexus, heart, left and right shoulder, throat, back of the neck, forehead, crown of the head and finally both hands, all this while praying to the Master, asking Him to remove all unwholesome shades and spirits and to cut all lingering links between one's self and them. This exact same formula can also be used for the creation of a potent incense blend, serving the same cause as the Protection Oil, and in the most severe cases, when the strongest of cleansings are necessary, such oil and incense can be used as follow-up to a cleansing ritual bath and would in such case ensure the removal of all spiritual parasites and other astral taints. 463"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60 �tlf-iatntbictinn ®il The following formula is for an oil to be employed within the rites of self-anointment, as a follow-up to having removed negativity and baneful influences from one's own self through the purifying rites, as such cleansings tend to leave a vacuum which needs to be filled in order to establish a foundation for desired forces to take root. This is something attained through the conscious alteration of the field of attraction and repulsion around one's person, in order to not allow the undesired influences that have been annulled to be replaced by a new set of equally unsought ones. This replacing of the negative that has been banished with the desirable, sympathetic and drawing elements, which will fill the vacuum left, is based on the fact that causal nature, in its rejection of the Purity of Emptiness, abhors a void and because of this horror vacui always seeks to fill it, which is the case if one does not consciously fill such void/vacuum left after the peeling away of the unwanted forces that had been attached and penetrated into the soul's outer layers. It is therefore important to dress and anoint one's self in accordance with that which one wants to take root around one's own spiritual frame, in order to compel the manifestation of the influences and forces attracting and granting fortification, blessing, luck, success, happiness, strength and victory upon one's chosen path. The following is the formula of the Self-Benediction Oil and each plant element is, as usual, to be fully consecrated and its Spirit petitioned properly to lend its blessings to the work, before it is mixed into the carrier oil, which in this case should be extra virgin Olive oil: 464 � 2 parts Allspice pa1 � 2 parts Bay Leaw: J � 2 parts Clove pollli � 2 parts Patchouli PI � 3 parts Cinnamoa 1 � 3 parts Jalap Roal:] � 3 parts Yerba S...

Once again the same formula can serve well the making of incense, and in such case the fumigation of the body, in connection with the anointment with the Self-Benediction Oil, will complement its powers and the manifestations of its blessings. In other settings, when necessity so indicates, the smoke of the Self-Benediction Incense may fully replace the oil, like in contexts where such oil is not available or still not ready for use, as the plant elements must have steeped within the carrier oil and have been shaken for at least 31 nights before the oil will be infused enough for use. 465"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"467"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"�j .... , �:\"<' �-rll Wransctn.bq Bnifitb t \" .. 4 Zammazo liiJI Zammazo E11p,N Zammazo EnarJI!

There are great mysteries of immense importance connected to the aspect of Baaltzelmoth, being the Qliphothic manifestation of the Spirit of Qayin as the Monarch of the sphere of Oreb Zaraq, but here lies also a secret pertaining to the exact identity of this aspect and how it compares to that which once was manifested upon the earth as the individual aspect of the spirit of our Master. The revelation of these mysteries is achieved by the realisation of the fact that Qayin and Qalmana, through their transcending of the limitations of the cosmic tree of life, unified their once divided spirits, thus achieving the wholeness and union of the Spirit that they had strived for. What this means is that Qayin and Qalmana, in their Qliphothic aspect, are as One and forever united in bliss and power as the Nightside Regent/s of the Black Light's Venus. Baaltzelmoth and Baalatzelmoth are in other words one and the same, in their Nightside manifestation, and it is actually this achievement of theirs that is reflected in the traced lines of the Spirit's Deathly Ascent Sigil, which shows the Divided Shards/Seeds of Spirit become unified through the Point of the Fire-Crowned Death. All this may seem paradoxical as we have throughout this book talked about the Holy Souls and Spirits of Qayin and Qalmana, as if they have retained their individual spiritual aspects, but this is because 469"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"their Spirit's modes of manifestation and influence on this accursed side of cosmic existence still become facilitated and affected through the traces of their being and becoming left here behind, both within the Bearers of the Mark and in the world throughout the unnaturally enspirited aspects of nature. This means that when their Spirit is accessed from, or manifested within, this world it will be through the forms of their earlier individual manifestations remaining still accessible to us and to Them. For example, when it comes to the inner and spiritual links through which They are reached, it is because their Bloodline bears the traces of their past individual manifestations, as the Mother and the Father of the Spirit-Awakened Lineage, that they still become perceived as two individual essences, and when it comes to the outer links through which they are contacted, it is primarily through their Enduring Souls, which are sympathetically still connected to the masculine and feminine aspects of their One Spirit. When it comes to their manifestation through other links, such as all the elements within this world that became enspirited by their graceful touch and their glorious deeds, all such things are still also links connected to their once divided aspects, which means that when they now become accessed or manifested through such elements bearing their imprints, their One Spirit still manifests as Qayin and/or Qalmana, instead of the Baaltzelmoth/Baalatzelmoth/Baalbaaltzelmoth, being the more transcendent aspect of Anamlaqayin (i.e. Qalmana and Qayin conjoined in Spirit), which represents their Liminal Point of Union upon Earth, signifying the earlier stage of their transcendence and complete spiritual conjunction. What this also reveals is the fact that each of their spiritual manifestations and intrusions into this world is an act of salvific and heroic sacrifice, as they for the sake of the furthering of the cause of the Black Light allow a fraction of their own Spirit to become crucified and divided upon the Cross of Matter, each time when a shard of their crystallised essence is seated upon a new earthly throne within the rites of fetishistic ensoulment and evocation.

To make a complicated matter simple, one can say that even though Qayin and Qalmana in essence are One in Sitra Ahra, their manifestations upon the earth will continue to take the individual forms of their distinct and divided aspects. We will therefore not experience Their Unity, until we ourselves have become united with Them, through the Death of the day-born ego and the Daath of the Spirit-Self. It is because of this that when we call upon Baaltzelmoth within the normal ritual settings, it is still the share of Their Spirit connected to the individual aspect of Qayin which often is addressed, and when we call upon the Baalatzelmoth it is the portion of Their Spirit that was once solely Qalmana's that we approach; even though we know that in essence their spirits are now One.

The closest Point of Gnosis connected to the unified aspect of the Twin­Seed of Sataninsam is the mentioned Anamlaqayin aspect, which is an eidolonic representation of the comprehensible aspect of the earthly stage of Qayin and Qalmana's Spiritual Marriage. This aspect of their spiritual union, as mentioned before, creates a Liminal Point through which the Baaltzelmoth/Baalatzelmoth/ Baalbaaltzelmoth can be glimpsed, as a Black Light shining at the end of what seemed to be an infinitely long tunnel of white darkness. The symbolism codifying the essence of the Anamlaqayin aspect is in itself revealing, as it shows a two-headed manifestation signifying the presence of a still dual-aspected spiritual essence, having initiated the process of At-Azothic Integration, but still maintaining their individual traits based on division. The Seating of the Anamlaqayin aspect is thus possible through the approach that the symbolic codification discloses, by simply bringing together, in an equal amount and power, the ensouling elements of Qayin and those of the Holy Qalmana and by their ritual intermingling attains the liminal union and marriage that can connect a fetish to the lingering aspect of the final phase of their Thrice Coronated and Unifying manifestation upon the Earth. The most potent way to accomplish this is to create both the Ensouling Tincture of Qayin and that of Qalmana and join them together in order to create the Ensouling Tincture of Anamlaqayin. Such fetish aids greatly in the attainment of further Gnosis concerning the Mystical Union of the Master and the Lady and acts as a crossroads opening the transcendental point towards the Other Side.
