In the firstpart is taught the means of calling forth the Elemental Spirits of the Air, Earth, Sea or of theInfernus, according to their affinities.In the second part are expressed the secrets, both Natural and Supernatural which operate bythe power of the Daemons. You will find the manner to make use of them, and all withoutdeceit.In the third part is the Key to the Work, with the manner of using it. But, before starting this, itwill be necessary to be instructed in the following: There are three powers, which are Lucifer,Beelzebuth and Astaroth. You must engrave their Characters in the correct manner and at theappropriate hours. Believe me, all this is of consequence, nothing is to be forgotten."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE FIRST BOOK Concerning the Characters of the Daemons.You must carry the aforesaid character with you. If you are male, in the right pocket, and it isto be written in your own blood, or that of a sea-turtle. You put at the two half-circles the firstletter of your name and surname. And if you wish more, you may draw the character on anemerald or ruby, for they have a sympathy for the spirits, especially those of the Sun, who arethe most knowledgeable, and are better than the others. If you are a female, carry the characteron the left side, between the breasts, like a Reliquary; and always observing, as much as theother sex, to write or have engraved the character on the day and in the hour of Mars. Obey thespirits in this, that they may obey thee.The spirits who are powerful and exalted, serve only their confidants and intimate friends, bythe pact made or to be made according to certain characters at the will of Singambuth or of hisSecretary. Aabidandes, of whom we will give you information, is the perfect acquaintance tocall, conjure and constrain, as you will see in the Key, where you will be given a method ofmaking a pact with the spirits. Of the Nature of Pacts.There are only two kinds of pact, the tacit and the apparent [or explicit]. You will know the onefrom the other, if you read this little book. Know, however, that there are many kinds of spirits,some attractive and others not attractive.It is when you make a pact with a spirit, and have to give the spirit something which belongs toyou, that you have to be on your guard. The Kinds of Spirits.In regard to spirits, there are the superior and the inferior. Names of the superiors are: Lucifer,Beelzebuth, Astaroth. The inferiors of Lucifer are in Europe and Asia, and obey him.Beelzebuth lives in Africa, and Astaroth inhabits America.Of these, each of them has two who order their subjects all that which the Emperor hasresolved to do in all the world, and vice-versa. The Visible Appearance of Spirits.Spirits do not always appear in the same shape. This is because they are not themselves ofmatter or form, and have to find a body to appear in, and one suitable to their intendedmanifestation and appearance.Lucifer appears in the form and figure of a fair boy. When angry, he seems red. There isnothing monstrous about him.Beelzebuth appears sometimes in monstrous forms, sometimes like a giant cow, at times like ahe-goat, with a long tail. When angry, he vomits fire."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Astaroth appears black, in human shape.Here are three characters of Lucifer, outside his circle:The following are those of Beelzebuth and Astaroth placed outside their circles: To Invoke the Spirits.It is only necessary, when you desire to invoke them, to call them by their characters, whichthey themselves have given. And when you wish to invoke them, call them to serve you, in themanner taught in the Third Part. Descending to the Inferiors.Lucifer has two demons under him: Satanackia and Agalierap. Those of Beelzebuth areTarchimache and Fleruty. The characters of Satanackia and Fleruty are:The two inferiors of Astaroth are Sagatana and Nesbiros, and their characters are:There are yet other daemons, apart from these, who are under Duke Syrach.

The powersof the eighteen above-mentioned ones are these:CLAUNECK has power over riches, can cause treasures to be found. He can give great richesto he who makes a pact with him, for he is much loved by Lucifer. It is he who causes moneyto be brought.MUSISIN has power over great lords, teaches all that happens in the Republics, and the affairsof the Allies.FRIMOST has power over women and girls, and will help you to obtain their use.KLEPOTH makes you see all sorts of dreams and visions.KHIL makes great earthquakes.MERSILDE has the power to transport anyone in an instant, anywhere.CLISTHERT allows you to have day or night, whichever you wish, when you desire either.SIRCHADE makes you see all sorts of natural and supernatural animals.HICPACTH will bring you a person in an instant, though he be far away.HUMOTS can bring you any book you desire.SEGAL will cause all sorts of prodigies to appear.FRUCISSIERE revives the dead.GULAND causes all illnesses.SURGAT opens every kind of lock.MORAIL can make anything invisible.FRUTIMIERE prepares all kinds of feasts for you.HUICTIIGARAS causes sleep in the case of some, and insomnia in others.Under Satanachia and Sataniciae are fourty-five [or, according to other versions, fifty-four]daemons. Four of these, the chiefs, are Sergutthy, Heramael, Trimasael and Sustugriel. Theothers are of no great consequence.These spirits are of great advantage, and they work well and speedily, in the case that they arepleased with the operator.Sergutthy has power over maidens and wives, when things are favourable."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Heramael teaches the art of healing, including the complete knowledge of any illness and itscure, He also makes known the virtues of plants, where they are to be found, when to pluckthem, and their making into a complete cure.Trimasael teaches chemistry and all means of conjuring of the nature of deceit or sleight-of-hand. He also teaches the secret of making the Powder of Projection, by means of which thebase metals may be turned into gold or silver.Sustugriel teaches the art of magic. He gives familiar spirits that can be used for all purposes,and he also gives mandragores.Agalierept and Tarihimal are the rulers of Elelogap, who in turn governs matters connectedwith water.Nebirots rules Hael and Surgulath. The former (Hael) enables anyone to speak in any languagehe will, and also teches the means whereby any type of letter may be written. He is also able toteach those things which are most secret and completely hidden.Sergulath gives every means of speculation. In addition, he instructs as to the methods ofbreaking the ranks and strategy of opponents. Subject to these are the eight most powerfulsubordinates:I. PROCULO, who can cause a person to sleep for forty-eight hours, with the knowledge of thespheres of sleep.II. HARISTUM, who can cause anyone to pass through fire without being touched by it.III. BRULEFER, who causes a person to be beloved of women.IV. PENTAGNONY, who gives the two benefits of attaining invisibility and the love of greatlords.V.

I,poor sinner that I am, beg Thee to deign bless and sanctify this water, so that it may be healthyfor my body and my soul, and that all foolishness should depart from it.Lord God, all-powerful and ineffable, and who led Thy people out of the land of ®gypt, andhas enabled them to cross the Red Sea with dry feet! Accord me this, that I may be purified bythis water of all my sins, so that I may appear innocent before Thee! Amen. When the operator has thus purified himself, he is to set about the making of the Instrumentsof the Art.Of the Magical Knife.It is necessary to have a knife or lancet, of new steel, made on the day and hour of Jupiter withthe Moon crescent. If it cannot be made, it may be bought, but this must be done at the time, asabove.Having achieved this, you will say the Orison or Conjuration following, which will serve forthe knife and lancet. Conjuration of the Instrument.I conjure thee, O form of the Instrument, by the authority of our Father God Almighty, by thevirtues of Heaven and by the Stars, by the virtue of the Angels, and by the virtue of theElements, by the virtues of the stones and herbs, and of snow-storms, winds and thunder: thatthou now obtain all the necessary power into thyself for the pefectioning of the achievement ofthose things in which we are at present concerned! And this without deception, untruth, oranything of that nature whatsoever, by God the Creator of the Sun of Angels!

The Manner of Asperging & Fumigation.First, there is the Orison which is needful on asperging, and it is thus recited:In the name of the immortal God, asperge [N] and clean you of all foolishness and all deceit,and you will be whiter than snow. Amen.Then pour as the aspersion blessed water thereon, saying:In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.These aspersions are necessary for every item of equipment; so also is the fumigation whichfollows.To fumigate, it is necessary to have a cruse, in which you place coal newly kindled with a newfire, and let it be well ablaze. On this you place aromatics, and when perfuming the article inquestion, say the following:Angels of God, be our help, and may our work be accomplished by you. Zalay, Salmay,Dalmay, Angrecton, Ledrion, Amisor, Euchey, Or. Great Angels: And do thou also, O Adonay,come and give to this a virtue so that this creature may gain a shape, and by this let our workbe accomplished. In the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the Holy + Ghost, Amen.Then recite the Seven Psalms which come after Judicum tuum Regida and Laudate Dominumomnes gentes. Of the Virgin Parchment.Virgin parchment can be made in many ways. Generally it is made of the skin of a goat or alamb, or other animal, which must be virgin.After inscribing on the blade AGLA, and having fumigated it, the knife will serve you for allpurposes.Remember that when you make the Sacrifice in order to obtain the virgin parchment from thekid, all the instruments must be on the altar."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"You make the baton [or Rod, staff] of the Art from Hazel wood that has never borne, and cut itwith a single stoke on the day and in the hour of Mercury [Wednesday], at the Crescent Moon.And you engrave it with the needle, the pen or the lancet, in the following characters:The seal and character of Frimost to be inscribed on the first Rod:Then you make another baton of Hazel wood, which has never borne, and which is withoutseed, and cut it in the day and hour of the Sun [Sunday], and on this you engrave thesecharacters:The seal and character of Klippoth is to be inscribed on the second Rod.This having been done, you say over your baton the following Orison: Orison.Most wise, most powerful Adonay, deign to bless, sanctify and conserve this bat™n so that itmay have the necessary virtue, O most holy Adonay, to whom be honor and glory for all time.Amen. Of the Lancet.It is necessary to have a new lancet, conjured and prepared like the knife and sickle. Make it inthe day and hour of Mercury, at the Crescent Moon. Now follows the method of Making theSacrifice of the Kid.Take your goat and place it on a flat surface, so that the throat is uppermost, the better to cutit. Take your knife and cut the throat with a single stroke, while pronouncing the name of theSpirit you wish to invoke.For example, you say:I kill you in the name and in the honor of [N]. . .This is to be well understood, and take care that you sever the throat at first, and do not taketwo strokes, but see that he dies at the first.Then you skin him with the knife, and at the skinning make this Invocation:Adonay, Dalmay, Lauday, Tetragrammaton, Anereton, and all you, Holy Angels of God, comeand be here, and deign to infuse into this skin the power that it may be correctly conserved, sothat all that is written upon it may become perfected."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"After the skinning, take well-ground salt, and strew this upon the skin, which has beenstretched, and let the salt cover the skin well. Before you use the salt it must have the followingBenediction said over it. The Benediction of the Salt.I exorcise you, O creature of the Salt, by the God who is living, the God of all Gods, the Lordof all Lords, that all fantasies may leave you, and that you may be suitable for the virginparchment.When this is finished, let the skin with the salt upon it remain in the sun for a full day. Thenobtain a glazed pottery jar, and write these characters around it with the Pen of the Art:Get quicklime and slake this with exorcised water, and put these in the jar. Whe it is liquidplace it in your goatskin, and leave it long enough for the hairs to peel off of themselves.As soon as the hair is in such a condition as to come off with a touch, remove it from the jarand peel the hairs with a knife made from carved Hazel. The knife must have had these wordssaid over it:O holiest Adonay, put into this wood the power to cleanse this skin, through the holy nameAgason, Amen.The skin, when peeled, may be stretched over a piece of new wood, and stones are to be placedon the skin, so that they hold it down. These are to be stones from a river bank. Before placingthe stones, say the following Orison over them. The Orison of the Stones.O Adonay, most puissant and all-powerful Lord, allow that these stones may stretch this skin,and remove from them all wickedness, so that they may possess the required power. Amen. Of the Aspersion of the Water.All water used in these experiments must be asperged, by saying this over it:Lord God, Father, all-powerful, my refuge and my life, help me, Holy Father, for I love you,God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of the Archangels and Prophets, Creator of All. Inhumility, and, calling upon Thy holy Name, I supplicate that thou wilt agree to bless this water,so that it may sanctify our bodies and our souls, through Thee, most holy Adonay, EverlastingRuler, Amen.The skin is allowed to dry after this, and before quitting the spot, say over the parchment:Je, Agla, Jod, Hoi, He, Emmanuel! Stand guard over this parchment, in order that no spectramay take charge of it!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"When the skin is dry it may be removed from its wodden frame, blessed and fumigated, andthen it is ready for use.It is important that this must not be seen by any women, and more especially during certaintimes of theirs [i.e., during menstruation], otherwise it will lose its power. It must also beknown that when you make and use this parchment, you must be clean, pur and chaste.The operator is to say one Mass of the Nativity then, and all the instruments are to be on thealtar. Of Aspersion.You take an asperser made with a bunch of mint, marjoram and rosemary which is secured bya thread which has been made by a virgin maiden.The asperger is made in the day and hour of Mercury when the Moon is at its crescent. Of the Perfumes.These are to be wood of aloes, incense and mace. As for the mace, this is all that you need forthe circle, and over the perfumes is to be said the following Orison: The Orison of the Aromatic Perfumes.Deign, O Lord, to sanctify the creature of this, in order that it may be a remedy for the humanrace, and that it may be a remedy for our souls and bodies, through the invoking of Thy holyName! Agree that all creatures which may breathe in the vapor of this may have wealth of theirbodies and souls: through the Lord who has fashioned the time eternal! Amen. Of the Pen of the Art.Take a new quill, and asperge and fumigate this in the same way as the other instruments, andwhen you are cutting its points, say:Ababaloy, Samoy, Escavor, Adonay: I have from this quill driven out all illusions, so that itmay hold within it with effectiveness the power needed for all those things which are used inthe Art: for both the operations and the characters and conjurations. Amen. Of the Ink-horn.You buy a new Ink-horn on the day and in the hour of Mercury. At this time, also, thesecharacters are [to be] inscribed upon it:JOD HE VAU HE + METATRON + JOD + KADOS + ELOHIM SABAOTH.Then newly-made ink is exorcised with this exorcism before being placed in the horn:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I exorcise you, Creature of this Ink, by the names Anston, Cerreton, Stimulator, Adonay, andby the Name of He who created all by one word, and who can achieve all, so that you shallassist me in my work, and so this work may be accomplished by my desire, and brought to asuccessful end through the agreement of God, He who rules all things, and through all things,omnipresent and eternal. Amen. Then the ink is to be blessed with this Blessing:Lord God, Almighty, ruler over all and forever, Thou who dost cause to take place the greatestwonders in Thy creations, deign to grant the grace of Thy holy spirit through this ink. Bless it,and sanctify it, and impart to it a special power, that whatever we may say or do or desire maybe accomplished: through Thee, Most Holy Prince, ADONAY. Amen. The Preperation of the Operator.When the implements are ready, the operator must prepare himself. This is first done by thisPreparatory Orison:Lord God, ADONAY, who hast formed man in Thine image, I, the unworthy and sinful,beseech Thee to sanctify this water, to benefit my body and soul, cause me to be cleansed.As he says this the operator is to wash his face and hands with the water that he is blessing.NOTE: This water is to be used for washing the hands and feet, and know alsoÑand know andknow againÑthat it is necessary and most necessary, to abstain three days from sin: and aboveall mortally, however much the human frailty may be, and especially guard your chastity.During the three days, study the book and during this time, pray five times during the day andfour times each night, with the following form:Astrachios, Asach, Ascala, Abedumabal, Silat, Anabotas, Jesubilin, Scingin, Geneon, Domol:O Lord my God, Thou who art seated higher than the Heavens, Thou who art seated higherthan the Heavens, Thou who seeth even unto the depths, I pray that Thou unto me the thingswhich I have in my mind and that I may be successful in them: through Thee, O Great God, theEternal and who reigns for ever and ever. Amen. [Shah gives a note of a variation: \"Astrocio,Asath, a sacra Bedrimubal, Felut, Anabotos, Serabilem, Sergen, Gemen, Domos: . . .\"]All this having been done correctly, all that remains is to follow your invocations and drawyour characters and you do as follows."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In the day and hour of Mars [Tuesday] the Moon being at the crescent, and at the first hour ofthe day—which is a quarter of an hour before sunrise—you will prepare a piece of virginparchment, which shall contain all the characters and the invocations of the spirits which youwish to produce.For example, in the said day and hour, you will attach to the small finger of the hand (which isthe finger of Mercury) a thread spun by a virgin girl, and pierce the finger with the lancet of theArt, to get blood from it, with which you form your Scirlin character, as is given at thecommencement of this book. Then write your invocation, which is that which follows. Invocation to Scirlin.HELON + TAUL + VARF + PAN + HEON + HOMONOREUM + CLEMIALH +SERUGEATH + AGLA + TETRAGRAMMATON + CASOLY.You must write the first letter of your name where is the letter A [in the sign & character ofScirlin], and that of your surname where is the letter D. The spirit Aglassis, whose character itis, is very potent to render you service, and will cause you to have power over the other spirits.Make above the Character of the Spirit that you desire to come, and burn incense in his honor.Then make the conjuration which is addressed to the spirit that you want to cause to appear,and burn incense in his honor.

He will greet you, and will order his companions toobey you.It does not always require as long as this to cause the angel to appear, however. He may comeon the fourteenth day, but this will depend upon the degree of application and fervor of theoperator.When he comes, ask him whatever you may desire, and also beg him to come and do your willwhenever you shall call him.When you want Anael to come again, after the first time, all you have to do is to perfume themirror, and say these words: Come, Anael, come, and let it be thy agreement --and the rest ofthis prayer to Anael as we have given you above, until the Amen.Dismissing the Spirit.When he has answered your questions, and you are satisfied with him, you must send him awayby saying this:I thank thee, Anael, for having appeared and having fulfilled my requests. Thou mayesttherefore depart in peace, and shall return when I call unto thee.The perfume of Anael is saffron. Divination by the Word of Uriel.To succeed in this operation, he who makes the experiment must do all things which are toldherein. He is to choose a small room or place which for nine days or more has not been visitedby women in an impure state [i.e., during their menstration period].This place must be well cleaned and consecrated, by means of consecrations and aspersions. Inthe middle of the room there is to be a table covered with a white cloth. On this is a new glassvial full of spring water, brought shortly before the operation, with three small tapers of virginwax mixed with human fat; a piece of virgin parchment, and the quill of a raven suitable forwriting with; an inkpot of chine full of fresh ink; a small container of metal with materials tomake a fire.You must also find a boy of nine or ten years old, who shall be well behaved and cleanlydressed. He should be near the table.A large new needle is taken, and one of the three tapers is mounted upon it, six inches behindthe glass. The other two tapers should be positioned at the right and left of the glass, and anequal distance away.While you are doing this, say:Gabamiah, Adonay, Agla, O Lord of Powers, aid us!Place the virgin parchment on the right of the glass and the pen and ink on the left. Beforestarting, close the door and windows."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Now stir the fire, and light the wax tapers. Let the boy be on his knees, looking into the glassvial. He should be bareheaded and his hands joined.Now the Master orders the boy to stare fixedly into the vial, and speaking softly into his rightear, he says:The Conjuration.URIEL + SERAPH + JOSATA + ABLATI + AGLA + CAILA, I beg and conjure thee by thefour words that God spoke with His mouth to His servant Moses: JOSTA + AGLA + CAILA+ ABLATI. And by the name of the Nine Heavens in which thou livest, and also by thevirginity of this child who is before thee, to appear at once, and visibly, to reveal that truthwhich I desire to know. And when this is done, I shall discharge thee in peace and benevolence,in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay.When this conjuration is finished, ask the child whether he sees anything in the vial. If heanswers that he sees an angel or other materialization, the Master of the operation shall say in afriendly tone:Blessed spirit, welcome. I conjure thee again, in the Name of the Most Holy Adonay, to revealto me immediately . . . . (Here the operator petitions the spirit for what he will.)Then say to the spirit:If, for any reason, thou dost not wish what thou sayest to be heard by others, I conjure thee towrite the answer upon this virgin parchment, between this time and the morrow. Otherwisethou mayst reveal it to me in my sleep.If the spirit answers audibly, you must listen with respect. If he does not speak, after you haverepeated the supplication three times, snuff the tapers, and leave the room until the followingday. Return the next morning, and you will find the answer written on the virgin parchment, ifit has not been revealed to you in the night.Divination by the Egg.The operation of the Egg is to know what will happen to anyone who is present at theexperiment.One takes an egg of a black hen, laid in the daytime, breaks it, and removes the germ.You must have a large glass, very thin and clear. Fill this with clear water and into it put theegg-germ.The glass is placed in the Sun at midday in summer, and the Director of the operation willrecite the prayers and conjurations of the day.These prayers and conjurations are such as are found in the Key of Solomon, in which we treatamply of airy spirits.And with the index finger, agitate the water, to make the germ turn.

If you are a gentleman, three girls will come; but if you are alady, three yound men will be involved.Then the three will draw lots as to whom is to stay with you.
